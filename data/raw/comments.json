With so many applicants being shrunk down to 21 people I imagine you were able to pick exactly who you thought could just slot right in with no training.\n\nYou had 9 out of 21 fail the phone screen.  I assume this is mostly vibe based and general work based.  So I can understand why 9 failed.\n\nYou then had 3 out of 12 people fail the data challenge.  I assume this was a basic data challenge to ensure you weren't just lying about credentials.  Which makes it odd that 25% failed, but again I can understand it.\n\nBut then 5 out of 9 failed the tech review.  I find that odd that so many failed.  Was it an experience issue with the tech stack.  Is this where technical questions about the tech stack were asked?\n\nAnything you would have wished gone different?

It’s *wildly ambitious* and technically impressive, but also not without issues.\n\n# ✅ What It Gets Right\n\n* **Extensibility**: You can plug in your own encodings/layouts/compression (Rust traits or WASM). That’s rare.\n* **Zero-Copy + Arrow Interop**: Shares memory with Arrow without copying — great for performance.\n* **Pushdown Compute on Compressed Data**: If supported, this is huge — filter/compute without decompressing.\n* **Forward-Compatible WASM Decompression**: You can ship a new encoding + its logic *inside* the file.\n* **Handles Ultra-Wide Tables**: O(1) access to 100k+ columns using FlatBuffers.\n\n# ❌ What It Gets Wrong (or Needs Work)\n\n* **Still immature**: Tooling is limited. No wide adoption (e.g., no Spark/Presto/DuckDB support).\n* **Too complex for most**: Great for low-level devs, but not plug-and-play for typical data teams.\n* **IPC Format = WIP**: This is critical for streaming/cloud-native workflows — and it’s not finished.\n* **Limited language support**: Rust and Python are solid; Java/Go/Scala? Not there yet.\n* **No benchmarks vs Parquet/Arrow**: Claims are strong, but I want charts.\n\n# ⚖️ Bottom Line\n\nVortex is **not** a Parquet replacement (yet), but it’s potentially **better** in specialized cases — like in-browser data tools, embedded systems, or custom DB engines.\n\nIf you love performance and control, it’s worth watching.  \nIf you need stable tooling and integrations, maybe hold off.",

My personal preference I Scala, although I'd probably recommend starting with Python as you'll see more materials online using this. \n\nIn terms of getting hands on \"big data\", more difficult but not impossible. There are tons of open datasets that you can practice using Spark on. Check on Kaggle, lichess, Google Big query sample data (for this one you cna get Google credits then write out these large datasets to parquet then you are good).\n\nI have to say that Spark was quite intimidating when I started around 6y ago but there are a lot of good materials out there.\n\n\nEdit: you will require basic sql knowledge but I would learn this via Spark APIs eg.

The Apache stack is a good place to start as it is free. Be warned, it is not easy with the configuration especially if you are a noob. You can also use the Databricks free edition to practice; and perhaps sign up for the databricks academy whilst you are at it.\n\nAlso, it is best that you also learn how to set up a linux virtual machine (to run your cluster), bash, get familiar with the linux terminal commands, and master SQL. The common sql flavours are Hive, Spark, Trino and PostGres. Heck even kafka uses its own brand of SQL. Learning PySpark is also useful, especially for Spark transformations and when using the Databricks platform. Learning Java is useful if you need to go deeper into those tools, as those big data tools by Apache run on Java, and the latest and greatest features are released on Java first. Learning git and docker (containerisation) is also useful for an infrastructure as code approach.\n\nIf you are intending to just be a user of Big Data platforms, just skip ahead to mastering SQL and PySpark.\n\nYou can also consider learning cloud infrastructure too (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) as they have their own flavours of big data infrastructure which is another rabbit hole to venture into. They have their own courses and certification programmes.\n\nFor a more holistic education, reading books on data warehousing, data lakes and delta lakes would cap it off nicely. The books by Kimball on data warehousing are one of such \"bibles\".\n\nLastly, you can consider proper schools. In my country, there are short courses by local polytechnics and universities for undergrads and post-grads, with substantial government subsidies on the course fees.",

Sure you can argue that the \"medallion architecture\" is just marketing crap rebranding an idea that's been in use for decades, but pre-aggregated data serves a vital purpose when you're serving data to analysts. Just off the top of my head:\n\n- To make calculations consistent across teams. If teams across large orgs aren't sharing code with one another (as what typically happens), one team might calculate the same KPI slightly differently from another. This is just an extension of the single source of truth logic that guides a silver layer.\n\n- Not all analysts on all teams are going to be technically proficient enough to produce the aggregated data they need. That's a great aspirational goal, maybe FAANG gets there with their amazing pickings. But for 99% of orgs, that just isn't happening.\n\n- Some analysts re-query the same data sets *a lot* during development. Do you really want them running a monster query with tons of joins repeatedly when you could just save compute by pre-aggregating the data for them?",

At my company, we treat both silver and gold as consumer-facing data marts. Silver is the atomic “business objects” (equivalent to fact/dim, but without the star schema).

        "body": "You don't want 23x the same data with different filters in your silver layer. Big Bets, Churn, strategic clients, clients without outliers, ... this is the same customer data, but filtered and modeled differently. Sure you can have an analyst make on the fly queries, but as soon as you automate that querying and store the result somewhere, you have a gold layer\n\nA good reason is that this distinction lets you keep your silver layer very data-centric instead of consumer centric. You can store things in columns such as ID - Atrribute Name - Attribute value without flattening them, which makes ingestion transparent. Or you maintain link tables and cross referentials, without having to decide upfront what the precise grain is\n\nSo your gold layer can be:\n\n* the PowerBi datamodel, Tableau view or anything an analyst generates directly\n* a curated layer specifically for a consumer (Marketing datamart, Sales datamart on another grian, pre-aggregated finance figures to show year to date on the book year, ...)\n* views or tables designed to be consumed by a specific consumer, such as pre-filtered reports or tables that generate a daily outbound file to be consumed by another tool\n\nThis may not be \"by the book\", but this is what I've always seen in practice",

Yes, this is my personal pet peeve. </rant>\n\nWhen you start joining things for the semantic layer, you are assigning purpose to them. For example, if you create a star, how you join the dimensions to the fact table gives meaning (explicit or implicit) to the data that may not be true in all instances. Those data products are meant to keep your core available for all purposes and not any specific one. That being said, you could query to the core layer directly, but it may not perform as well as the semantic layer. The core is more about the relationships of the data at an overall business layer. When you are conforming and loading the core, you don't want the business queries getting in the way.",

They’re vastly underestimated and require dedicated resources, which should include a project manager, business stakeholders, and engineer(s). \n\nThe worst project? A migration with no validation, a lack of business user validation, and/or a rushed timeline. Projects without validation are almost always dead on arrival. The exception being an incredibly straight forward system (with low customization) that you’ve handled multiple times. I can tell within the first three months if it’s going to flop based on business users lack of engagement and/or validation. \n\nYou could do everything right as far as schema to schema and wind up with the destination enterprise software handling the end result poorly due to rules represented outside the schema (or api) definitions. \n\nEven something as simple as moving files is often overlooked in data migrations between systems, which can range from super straight forward PDFs to custom templates you need to rebuild by passing data into. File type compatibility issues, number of files per record and representation of those files on the front-end, file size limits, etc. \n\nThe fact you’re doing migrations straight into production without validation rounds (using production data) raises a 🚩for a potential long term headache.

This experience was a catalyst for my professional growth.\n\nIn that role, **PySpark** was our main framework. We used it to build scalable ETL/ELT pipelines capable of processing massive datasets efficiently. For orchestration, we relied on **Apache Airflow**, which was a game-changer for automating and monitoring our data workflows.\n\nTo manage our code and documentation, we used **GitHub** and **GitLab**. This ensured that our development process was organized, collaborative, and easy to track. For data analysis and validation, I used **Hue** to run queries and visualize data directly on our Hadoop cluster. And for database administration, **DBeaver** was my go-to tool for managing both **MySQL** and **Oracle** environments.\n\nThis exposure to a modern, integrated tech stack was invaluable. It not only deepened my technical skills but also prepared me for the demands of the current job market.\n\n\n\n# > Is It a Bad Career Choice to Stay?\n\nYes, in terms of professional growth, it absolutely is. Your current role is a maintenance position that doesn't challenge you or equip you with the skills needed to be competitive in the modern data engineering field. You're not building new solutions or working with the tools that most companies are using.\n\n\n\n# > Would You Take a Pay Cut to Leave This Situation?\n\nYes, I would. A pay cut is not a loss; it's an investment in your future. Accepting a lower-paying job that uses modern technologies will significantly increase your market value in a few years. Think of it this way: a small short-term loss in salary could lead to a much larger long-term gain in earning potential.\n\nGiven that you're in your early 30s, you have plenty of time to pivot. Use your current low-stress environment to your advantage. Take the time to study and build personal projects using tools like **PySpark**, **Apache Airflow**, and cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure. By actively building this experience, you can turn a potentially stagnating situation into a stepping stone for a dynamic and rewarding career.",

We all learn at our own pace.  Some learn faster, some learn slower.\n\nThat being said, confidence comes when you can accept your circumstances and just live with it.  Make a mistake? Be fine with it.  Do a great job? Feel proud, but don't let it get to your head.  People being shitty to you when you're trying to improve? Ignore them and keep your head down.  This is all part of learning and improving.\n\nSecond advice - if you want to be concretely better at stuff, only use LLMs when you want to save time doing things you already know how to do.  If you use LLMs to completely generate the output you are looking for, you will end up with huge gaps in your knowledge.  People hate the idea of spending time learning things, lean on LLMs to do everything for them, and in a few years wonder rage on Reddit about how they can't get a job because they get rejected for trying to use an LLM during an interview.",

It encourages knowledge gaps and creates a weird time dysphoria. Your work starts getting done pretty quickly, and you know that you don't quite know the material yet. But there's no time to study because you've submitted work and now there is more work on your plate. Then, you try to do something yourself without the llm and find out that there is no way you can possibly learn the material and submit your work before the work is due. OP Will have created an unachievable time frame for submitting work. \n\nHowever!! I think that you're downvotes are a little bit unfair. I absolutely believe that OP can learn a lot from LLMs. There is however, a responsible and ethical way to go about it. In order not to create a weird time dysphoria and knowledge gaps OP still needs to be the one producing the work. LLMs make a great research and reference tool for anyone looking to learn a new skill or improve upon the skill they already have. The trick is to ask better questions. Stop worrying so much about how to get your task done and instead ask why it should be done a certain way.  Get deeper with the strategy of approach. Write the code yourself, and ask it for a critical review based on your goals. \" What have I missed?\", \" am I using best practices?\", \" what does it mean to have traceability?\"\n\nThese are all questions that an LLM can help clarify and fill the knowledge Gap. OP needs to learn the language, so they can communicate with the senior developers in a productive way. \n\nAnyway, I gave you an upvote so that hopefully your comment is seen and taken seriously. It was very positive and encouraging.",

        "body": "Obviously, great work if you did that alone without much DE experience beforehand. I guess a few points to consider:\n\n1. How will the pipeline behave if the UI changes on the website you are pulling the data from, or if the website is down or behaving slowly? In my own experience, Selenium is quite limited to basic actions like “wait for page to load” or “wait until the export button appears.” I would assume you, as a BI Analyst, would probably know when the UI change happens since you are closer to the business user. But still, you don’t (at least you have not mentioned it) have any sort of monitoring or alerting and are just relying on everything working smoothly. So I would advise thinking about adding logging and alerts for those cases.\n2. Again, this kind of follows the second point, but it would probably make sense to add some retry logic when pulling the data if the website is slow on that particular day.\n3. Raw data is usually pretty fucking bad, and it’s the task of a Data Engineer to make the business see only pretty fucking good data. What I mean by that is: do you have any validation in place to prevent bad data from getting into your Power BI models? You mentioned you are pulling customer data profiles and geolocations, and this kind of data is soooo easy to get messed up - it’s insane. For example, postal codes being bad, or missing pieces of an address, like the street being available but not the city, etc. So I would think about adding some sort of validation for your data, if it’s not already part of the transformations you are doing.\n4. You are pulling the Excel files, applying and saving them, and then reading them and saving as parquet. Why? Literally, no offense, but why? You have two versions of the same file in different file formats stored. I would probably store the raw Excel files somewhere for archival purposes so that if you need to check the raw data, you don’t need to re-download them. But I would store transformed files directly in parquet to avoid unnecessary reads/writes.\n5. Create/replace tables is a simple, working strategy, which is cool, but really inefficient for big tables since you have to reload everything. I would suggest checking out `MERGE` or `INSERT...ON CONFLICT` statements for incremental updates so that if a row is unchanged from the previous table version, you don’t need to reload it. Also, I assume your SQL commands look like: `CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT * FROM 'file1.parquet';` Which is normal, but I would advise wrapping it in transaction logic. What does this mean? Imagine your tables fail in the middle, and you have 10 tables. Now you are stuck with 5 updated and 5 old tables - sucks, right? To ensure that your group of loading operations is atomic (meaning they either all succeed or all fail together), you must manually wrap them in a transaction block. That way, you know for sure that either all of them were updated, or all of them are in their previous state, but the data is still consistent between them.\n\nAgain, what you did is really solid, especially for your first time, but maybe my wall of text will help you a bit. I am also open to any comments since I suck at DE and maybe messed up somewhere. Be very proud of what you designed.",

You probably want to turn this into a fight between cost sensitive executives and feature desiring business units. Executives entire life is getting business units to do more with less.\n\n\"Sure we can have your super dashboard at the price of one billion dollars, or your business units can give us specs for their common analysis and use cases and we can get you all that for 1 million dollars.\"\n \n\"When I hear we need everything what I am hearing is that you are not communicating and prioritising your biggest value adds. Lets start with them and work from there.\"",

I work on Holistics and thought of sharing our approach since we’ve solved similar problems)*\n\nYou’re trying to support open-ended drilldowns across store, brand, UPC, and other dimensions. But the volume and complexity of the data make it tough to do efficiently. Not just in terms of compute or memory, but also the maintenance overhead of managing all the possible drill paths and aggregations manually.  \n  \nWhat we’ve seen work well is defining the relationships between dimensions once in a semantic model. That lets you build dashboards where users can freely [drill down](https://docs.holistics.io/docs/interactions/drill-down) from sales by city → category → brand → UPC, without needing to predefine or materialize every path.\n\nYou can also let users click into any data point to [view the underlying data](https://docs.holistics.io/docs/interactions/view-underlying-data) behind it—what made up that sales number at the brand or SKU level.\n\nAll of this can run live on your warehouse (Databricks supported), but you can manage cost with:\n\n* **Aggregate awareness (**[docs](https://docs.holistics.io/docs/aggregate-awareness)**)**: Automatically routes queries to the most efficient table based on user granularity\n* **Caching**: Avoids sending a duplicate query to your data warehouse when results are already available\n\nHope that gives a useful perspective.

Yes, obviously GPUs have become big — if you’re paying any attention to either the tech or finance space you would’ve seen Nvidia dominating with their explosive stock growth (you know, during a gold rush, sell shovels and all that). A much more interesting discussion around this is how the AI boom is basically keeping the (American) economy sustained; how we’re on the verge of data center infrastructure bubble bursting similar to the telecom bubble the late 90s; how we’ll have trouble feeding electricity to all these new data centers and how electricity prices will continue go up because of that and because policy makers are putting the brakes on renewables; how all this new AI tech is amounting to little more low quality slop being generated at an unprecedented rate and we’re essentially stuck with it forever. Yes, I know these technically different topics but I find them much more relevant and the educated discussions around them much more insightful.\n\nThis article is just about shifting more computing resources to hardware designed for matrix multiplications… like, yea no shit. The title is clickbait, the content is feeble, and the whole premise is weak. Regular CS fundamentals are not going anywhere and will always be a core element of computing. I find Andrew Ng and Andrej Karpathy’s statements around this much more interesting — that with each paradigm shift, the makeup of software (and hence hardware) just shifts. I get that this article is essentially saying that, but there just isn’t much there besides the obvious.",

Also AE and DE can be synonymous with one another it really just depends on the company so can be important to look at the actual responsibilities.

And it's heavily focused on the parts you can copy/paste from articles or stackoverflow (basic email regex, basic dockerfile, basic fastapi setup), not the parts for which an actual data engineer is needed (considerations for filetypes, data structures, algorithms, partitioning, larger-than-memory processing, multi-node processing, data lineage, access control, data quality for a team of at least 10 to 20 contributors, etc).\n\nIf you're humble, open-minded, you connect with the team, and you learn from them: all good. As long as you have enough understanding of the fundamentals (intuitive understanding, not leetcode), we can teach you the rest.\n\nIf, instead, you feel bad about being considered a Junior at first, you feel a constant need to talk about having been Lead Solution Eng. in the past, and it's distracting you from learning the job -> won't last.\n\nPay/salary would be Junior while you grow to Medior. If you have more experience than I would have guessed, or you learn faster, I could see someone get that raise within 3 months. If you have a normal trajectory instead, it would usually happen after 3+ years.\n\n----\n\ntl;dr: Seems like a lot of info, it boils down to:\n\n- Is going from Lead Solution Engineer to Data Engineering your genuine passion/interest? If it is, enjoy it, enjoy learning, let go of expectations. If it isn't, reconsider. It seems more sideways than upwards, which means reskilling.\n- Impostor syndrome can come from your expectations for yourself. You've never worked in this field, it's not appropriate to have expectations. Become a student again. Focus on learning the needs of the role, not on yourself / your self-doubt / your perception of yourself.",

Nothing else matters, and can be seen as a negative/distraction. You could learn >99% of technologies in the world and still not get a job if you didn't learn the 1 technology the company needed.\n\nFind yourself a company that can use your background beneficially (instead of seeing it as a negative), and that's willing to give you support to fill in the gaps while you're learning.\n\nI would say \"that's it\", but to be honest whether or not you find a company like that depends 100% on the individual hiring managers you will meet/interview, and you do need to get lucky.\n\nBut the good news is that no impostor syndrome is ever needed on this path.",

This avoids constant vacuum churn from doing small upserts, and you still get perf. If you need point in time queries, keep the bronze and build a silver that is deduped by key and day.\n\nDo you need only latest or point in time? Do deletes happen a lot or rare? How big are the hot tables and what is the 95p change rate?\n\nIf you opt for the \"zero-ETL\" approach, for organization, keep your data in S3 partitioned like `s3://your-bucket/db_name/table_name/dt=YYYY/MM/DD/hr=HH/`. That layout plays nice with Redshift Spectrum and makes pruning way more effective when you're querying or loading batches. Helps a ton with downstream compaction and dedup too, since you can scope it to a smaller time window instead of scanning everything.\n\nDedup pattern is primary key plus Debezium ts\\_ms or source commit lsn, with a tie breaker on op where create beats update beats delete. Partitioning matters for both Spectrum pruning and for batch merge windows, so compact small stuff like five minute files into larger hour files.\n\nAlternatively, if you want a no fuss route, Estuary can land CDC into Redshift with append only and handle dedupe and merges cleanly.

Do one pass to get the roster of IDs, store that set, then on each poll diff the set to find new and missing IDs.\n\nHere are a few things that worked for me in the past on similar issues: For updates, fetch in batches but avoid refetching everything every time. Keep a raw bronze table of the exact JSON per employee keyed by employee_id plus poll_time and a content_hash. If the hash changed since last poll, mark it changed and upsert into your modeled tables. If an ID disappears from the roster for a few consecutive polls, tombstone it. Add last_fetched_at and last_changed_at in your modeled table, and keep headers like ETag or Last Modified if the API gives them.\n\nStart with a tiny script using requests plus a small state store in Postgres (or just a json file), and land raw to object storage or DuckDB. Polling is still fine here, but tier it by heuristics. Recently created or recently changed IDs get polled more often, long lived records get sampled less. Backfill can be a manual trigger, then switch to a low frequency poll. This avoids full refresh while staying honest about data quality.\n\n roughly how many employees and what rate limit do you have, do you need SCD2 history or is last write wins fine, and how should deletes be represented in the warehouse?",

The shift toward treating data infrastructure more like software has been one of the biggest changes I've seen over the past few years.\n\nI think the \"data is too messy\" argument is kinda missing the point though. Like yeah, data is messy and unpredictable in ways that traditional software isn't, but that's exactly why you need better tooling and processes around it. The messiness doesn't go away just because you're cowboy coding your way through it.\n\nThe schema as code thing is huge. We believe very strongly in general \"data as code\" principles at Tinybird (all resources defined as code and managed with version control). Seen a lot of people get burned because their production schema drifted from what they thought it was, or they made an upstream change that broke downstream consumers without realizing it. Having that versioned and trackable is just basic hygiene at this point.\n\nThe local dev environment piece is important too. One thing that I love about webdev, specifically Next.js, is just spinning up that local next server and getting instant feedback on front end changes. We've focused on that a lot at Tinybird, making it easier for people to not only spin up ClickHouse locally, but actually test the whole pipeline end-to-end including ingestion and API layer. It's a huge shift in the right direction imo.\n\nI guess the key is not just blindly copying SE practices but adapting them for data's unique challenges. Like CI/CD for data pipelines needs to handle things like data quality checks, schema validation, backfill strategies etc that traditional software CI/CD doesn't really deal with.",

You can get the archetypal trope of \"Do impossible question for interview, only need `SELECT * FROM` in the job\" to getting a competency style interview where they focus more on seeing what you think.\n\n>How do I bridge the gap between tutorials and production-level knowledge?\n\nI think this is in itself a bit of a telling question when asked because it's under the impression that \"production grade\" is something magically different when it can be succinctly described as building something which isn't total shit.  How is something not total shit? It depends on the feedback from your manager and your team as long as it's constructive and makes sense rather than comments like \"I don't like it\".\n\nConceptually, most things you are going to make for a company should have the ambition to reach production, thus, it should be as complete as possible.\n\nIf it's something only you use personally, then it doesn't matter what it looks like.\n\nIf it's something somebody else will see or use, it shouldn't be shit.  It should be predictable, easy to understand and use.  Simple to make changes.  Flexible for reuse.  Testable to some degree (depends on your platform).  Observable at all required points.

You’ll probably want to also tie datasets back to specific reports depending on the analysts capabilities in your organization. You should also structure this better with a historical table and what not - just explaining an example approach and not a perfect ERD. \n\nIf analysts are viewing reports (and not building) then it might make sense to have a warning label on each report that appears when the dataset is considered stale. This will depend on your analysts tooling though and if they’re viewing raw data, using bi tools, etc. \n\nYou could also use something as simple as an email group with email notifications when pipelines fail. I don’t recommend this personally, but it might be quick if you need this done fast.",

Home page items are the most popular items and the best selling products are the top performers in revenue -- they could have some overlap.\n\nThe once-per-month refresh is only on this report alone, but the rest of the reports being asked are all standard.",

        "body": "You are going about it in a weird way. Go back to your management and convince them to apply the concept of an analytics window. \n\nI have worked on this problem multiple times already, most notably with logistics. It’s the same concept with deliveries in that open orders on the last few days of the month will only be closed many days after. My advice is that you get the highest possible time that the order is closed, use that as your window, and only calculate by then. This is similar to intra-day calcs where hourly measures have maybe a window of a few minutes, a variance expectation, and an end-of-day resolution via batch job. \n\nAs an example: if closing an order takes 4 days maximum like in your case, then calculate your close rate on the morning of the 5th. Basically, you’ve given all open orders from the previous month the appropriate waiting time to close. This way, you can properly report on them already.\n\nWhat of the still open orders by then? Consider them unresolved. This is an analytical tradeoff your management should accept on a monthly basis. If they find this problematic, then do multiple checkpoints: an initial view a day after the month (highest number of open orders), a view after the initial window, i.e. T+5, and a view maybe 2 weeks after. At that point, you should be able to have extreme confidence in your data. Variance should be very low, except in extreme outlier circumstances.\n\nIf revenue is being tracked using this order system, well… you’re doing it wrong. Or rather your company is doing it wrong. They should be doing that off of your invoice system, not your analytical data. It can be a placeholder, sure, but nothing says money earned as well as money that actually arrived in the bank etc. The best you SHOULD tell your stakeholders is that this is estimated revenue from orders and that it is not indicative of actual money coming in. That is for the finance department to resolve, not yours. You’re a data engineer. And unless your name is Harry, you’re most probably not a wizard either.\n\nOverall, your approach can be solved by educating your stakeholder/client/management and reaching a compromise with them. Otherwise, you are in for a world of pain.",

Good data engineering benefits from a perspective that plants trees you'll probably not enjoy the shade of. \n\nComment your code with intent, explain the reason why you are doing what you are doing in that moment in documentation and note when you are doing the same thing multiple times. When you first start it is often easy to build something that works initially but is ultimately not going to scale or isn't maintainable. Learning from those times helps you think about the bigger picture and understand the true scope of a given ask. \n\n\nExample: the company is recording things in Excel files and they want you to make some of the data available in a consolidated dashboard. You could just grab the specific data/fields from the files and write them to a database then point a dashboard to it. That would fulfill the request but then in 6 months they realize they want other data from those old Excel files and you need to reprocess them again to get the rest of the data. \n\nWhereas if at the start you consider the durability of the files and potential future needs vs. Cost of storage you may have taken everything from those files. Then when the ask for more of the data eventually comes you can provide the data in a fraction of the time and you've ensured that everything is backed up in case some accidentally deletes a source file.",

You have the opportunity to get extremely hands on and deep into tech that entry DEs only interact with in daily workflows. Be willing to fail, set expectations correctly, ensure you are always at least delivering real business value along with any exploratory skill buildings projects.\n\nfor the bad, be aware that you do not have a real mentor and whatever way you come up with may not be the best way and always seek to challenge your own positions and decisions. You may also not get the budget to roll out snowflake/databricks or any of the enterprise grade tools\n\nWhat I’d do, keep reading and asking questions. Follow the big companies and names you see on here on LinkedIn. Bookmark stuff that sounds interesting even if it doesn’t apply to you yet. Work with business to set goals for what they want out of data and strive to come up with a plan that meets that. That’ll keep you grounded. Find OSS tools that are analogs to the enterprise tech but costs you nothing for small business workloads (airbyte/dlt instead of fivetran, Postgres instead of snowflake, Dagster/prefect and dbt)\n\nPush yourself really hard for 3 years and you’ll be more competitive than you think!",

On one hand, you will have access to unlimited opportunities, use cases and business problems you can take on and go after yourself. On the other, you’ll find yourself cursing alot due to persistent frustration while this rocket wobbles all over the place. \n\nI tend to describe working at a startup as “an unlimited buffet”. You CAN eat until you throw up. But you must love the interim experience upto the point of throwing up in the metaphor. \n\nIn terms of learning and growth, don’t expect someone to hold your hand, or build you a structured learning path or tell you what to do or how to do it. YOU are going to be doing all of that for yourself. \n\nLastly, you will need to have a very high tolerance for frustration and lack of documented information, well defined standards and processes, crystal clear priorities and just pain overall. If you get frustrated easily because the business requirement wasn’t clear for you to immediately start coding your data pipeline or SQL query, then startups aren’t a viable place to work for you. \n\nHaving said all of that, you WILL NOT find a more buzzing, lively and exciting opportunity to work and learn. It’s the same kind of thrill people get when going on those super risky rides, knowing that you might fall from the sky but the adrenaline rush of doing one is rewarding enough to go for it. So my advice? GO FOR IT!!",

Additionally, you can probably BS a later cover letter, resume, or interview and speak to things that you \"did\" with enough knowledge and business context to explain them.\n\nA few books are very commonly suggested here, the top two of which are \"The Data Warehouse Tool-kit\" and \"Designing Data Intensive Applications\". I haven't yet read the former but am reading through the latter. It's definitely a complicated book as it greatly goes into detail on different paradigms and applications. In fact, it may be a bit too dense too soon; either beforehand, or as they arrive, I would also look into tools that are similar to what your company is using. Learn what the differences are and try to understand why one may have decided to go with your current stack, and why one might want to move away from it.\n\nLastly, for now, I stress paying attention to soft skills. I've been burned before being the only person at a start-up (kinda, it was complicated and I was largely separated from anyone else who may have been able to help, and they have largely different priorities). My boss had certain expectations that were tough to realize, partly because of these different priorities. I could've done better to manage them, to an extent. Alas, this led to my being let go - wouldn't want this to happen to you.",

If you have access to python and pandas, use it. Doing this entirely in VBA macros would be challenging. If your team has access to their own database server, that might be an option as well. The question will be where that script will live and run on a daily basis. \n\nThe other challenge you are facing sounds like understanding how to join your data sources to get the desired output, and it sounds like even the final output structure might not be fully defined yet. You need to know exactly what level of detail your final output should be and work backwards on how to get there. My understanding as you described it, you need a current view of commercial customers based on the previous business day, at the customer level, their CCID (commercial customer ID), some data related to that at the company/business level, delivered daily to a brand new Excel file which will live in a shared folder where another team can access it. Where it's not clear, is what level of data you are looking for. If it's at the company/business level, you mentioned you only need one id per company, then what is unique about customers that you need? Dates? Their commercial  status? If at customer level, should it be customer, account level? I see two levels you are looking at that you need to resolve, commercial customer (id), and individuals associated with that id. Look for maybe a relationship code in the source that has individuals, there may be a single individual with a primary relationship you can filter on, without knowing more, it would be difficult for anyone to help you with your join issues. It will be way easier to figure it out if you can import all that data into some kind of structured database environment, and pandas can emulate that.",

Also if you are using execute script type processors (especially with python), you should revisit to see what new native processors exist.  If there aren't any that suit your needs then python as a first class citizen enables you to make custom processors.  Lastly I know it was touched upon but there was a shift from flow.xml.gz to flow.json.gz, so depending on what your version is on 1.x you might need to hop twice for the encryption (mentioned) and conversion as both files exist for some later versions and only the json is needed in 2.x",

You can use a custom encoding fine tuned on task specific output layers but 99% of the vibe coders don’t know this.\n2. OCR works great if you use the right OCR.  Cloud based OCR APIs from Azure, AWS, Google.  All can be set up securely and are 10-100x cheaper than LLMs.\n3. Find the right tool.  Look into successors of LayoutLM specifically built for charts.  Though at the end of the day this is a hard problem and most likely an XY question type ask.\n\nIf this really is the client’s data and they’re not scraping charts from some other data source, why can’t you just recreate the charts with their data?  \n\nIf they are scraping charts from other places, are they able to extract the raw SVG or similar vector format?  If you can get the raw vectorized image you can pull out the information manually without AI.",

Link tables should fulfil that purpose. \n\nLinks will be dependent on the same natural keys that your sats / hubs are dependent on but all hashes should be built independently. That is one of the primary benefits of a data vault / hashed key approach, all tables can be built in parallel. This compares to e.g. traditional Kimball approach where you must generate the identity keys on the dim and then join to reference then in the fact.\n\nThe only dependency you would have is if e.g. a link table joins e.g. 2 source systems, the source data from both systems must be loaded before you build the link table to ensure you represent the complete relationship.",

Yet, there are situations in where we find a bridge better as it displays our normalized world better. However, i do believe you are right in that you can make simple links for everything (so we got lazy i guess). For example:\n\n\\- A \"budget\" is not something on itself, it's a concept that only lives in the combination of a cost center, a account and a date (you can also choose to do this on year/month etc). As cost center, account and date are all individual objects on itself you will not include these values within the sat of budget but rather will include their keys in the link table of budget. Budget in this essence will be a bridge table (it doesn't exist without either one of these three). Of course one could argue to just make budget a hub/sat combination  without considering why it exists in the first place. That way, one could probably kill all bridges.\n\n\\- On the other side, we do got lazy sometimes in that we find it convenient to make bridges as we blow up our database schema with link/sat tables (like 6 combinations for 3 associations). Maybe we should put effort making deployments faster?\n\n**Link tables and keys from 2 objects**\n\nLet's say we have cost center and business unit. Both are individual objects so both have a hub/sat, resulting in the following:\n\n1- Cost Center (primary key = hash of costcenterid (costcenter id is the id column from the source system table we have as a landing table in this example).\n\n2- Business unit (primary key = hash of businessunitid (businessunit id is the id column from the source system table we have as landing table in this example).\n\nNow, we know each cost center belongs to 1 business unit (and a business unit can have 1 to \\* cost centers). We decide to make a link table for that association and need to load: 1) the hash of cost center (as in example 1), 2) the hash of business unit (as in example 2) and the hash of those two keys that represent their relationship/will be the pk of the link table. \n\nThis is the exact situation we are trying to tackle. We don't want to hash the key again from the source system (as we already did in example 1 and 2). We are trying to set some kind of list that holds all keys so we can reuse them in situations like this without the need of hashing them again. In that list one can then see how the key is built up (in cases of composites that might come handy when mapping to a link). I'm not sure if this will be faster than just hashing again separately (as one needs to join the keychain). Writing this, it might be even more efficient to make something that just stores how each key is build as it forces some consistency (for example, whenever a object has 30 links, you want to make sure each time the key is constructed the same way).\n\nSorry for my mind dump.\n\nGreetings",

You can define the hash definition centrally in the staging view layer (as code logic) and then your downstream hub / sat / link tables are just subsets of the columns you need + the additional metadata column required for those tables.\n\nIf you use dbt this is quite easy to generalise and manage as (a) you get good lineage / traceability from landing / bronze to staging views to DV layer, and (b) your hub / sat / link table definition can be generalised with macros which will automatically create the metadata columns based on the table output type you indicate, so you don't need to define each column individually.\n\nWe built a custom version of this for one of our clients, but you can also leverage open source solution like: https://automate-dv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nIf you're using a spark environment (e.g. Databricks/Fabric) you could also look at writing generalised pyspark functions that achieve the same objective, although I think using dbt would be cleaner and less custom.\n\nI'm still not too sure what you mean by keychain but I would avoid any solution that involves centrally writing and looking up hash values based on values precalculated in a table as this against the parallelism / scaling that's fundamental to DVs.\n\nIf you have situations where you need multiple levels of processing / calculation to achieve a reporting requirement (e.g. calculating trial balance from general ledger based on very specific rules), then you can do that in information/data mart downstream of your DV as staging tables ending in dim / facts. \n\nData Vault should be just about loading data with history tracking into a business entity relationship DV model as quickly/simply as possible. A certain degree of code repetition is unavoidable and a trade-off that you make for being able to load everything in parallel.",

Focus on showcasing those skills. Review the basics of REST APIs, common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and how to work with JSON data in Python. Even a quick refresher will help you discuss these concepts intelligently. If you get stumped, talk through your thought process and explain how you \\*would\\* approach the problem if you had more experience in that specific area. You can also use [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) to ace your interview. I'm on the team that built it, and we designed it to help people in situations just like yours.",

Basically, each connector has a set of identical tasks, each one of which is a virtual thread in JVM. The tasks are distributed through all Kafka connect nodes, so each node has approximately the same number of running threads. \n\nSource connector tasks each have Kafka producer inside, while sink connector tasks have consumers. If you understand how simple producers and consumers work, you should easily understand why distributing Kafka Connect is much easier than Kafka itself, since most of the work is done by Kafka itself (storing consumer group offsets for example). The state of Kafka Connect is stored in special topics. \n\nDebugging should be the same as with any other JVM application. It's usually possible to run connector or task locally outside of running Connect cluster, and it's even easier so with SMT. It also supports JMX out of the box.\n\nThe real problem is that many connector plugins are not open source (for example the ones from Confluent), so you have to rely on documentation and forums.",

And then after that, set up a sink connector to read from that topic and put it in another table. \n\nIf you want, you can even practice doing some data manipulation in your config files as well.

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery.  I'd recommend looking up some videos which will explain this much better than I can.  Take a look at some blog post etc. just generally get a few viewpoints and explanations as to what it is.\n\nGenerally, you develop code for your application locally and then it runs somewhere else on a schedule.  So, you have to get your code over to the location where it runs.  The process for most workflows is develop on your machine -> push to a branch/repo -> submit pull request to main -> deploy to where it runs.  This is a CI/CD process.\n\nTo avoid it getting too complicated, your CI/CD process is likely going to be as simple as branching off main -> making changes -> pushing to your remote branch -> pull to main -> auto publishing main -> schedule application via Github actions.\n\nThis is assuming you're familiar with git and source control.  If not, this is a great opportunity to learn.",

You learn a lot from doing simple tasks that seem to be quite straight-forward but detailed problems will teach you to become a better engineer. For example, I found some miss requirements or error handling issues when writing unit tests (which is normally automated by AI).\nSo, if your boss tell you that, I think he is concerning about the company's money, since productivity is x2 with AI.

        "id": "nanlj5g",
        "body": "I think it might be a little bit of a misunderstanding to hear different programmers experiences about their work hours and relate that to their efficiency as a programmer. Some of us are working on legacy systems that are so vast and full of engineering debt that we could never hope to make more than small changes at a time, lest we cripple an entire business model in some catastrophic way. And sometimes the expectations of the work environment dramatically shift leaving programmers with much more to do. Environment has everything to do with it. Programmers who are first in line at a start-up building brand new products from scratch are going to go blazing fast, while those working in enterprises with bureaucracy and existing customers will need to move much more purposefully. Finally, you have to consider that different programmers will target different career velocity.\n\nWith that out of the way I also have an answer to the specific question about productivity.\n\n**Become a master of your debugging tools**\n\nKnowing how to use breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, logging services and query languages for interpreting your logs is critical. If you're operating live services you probably also want to start picking up the ability to analyze and understand crash dumps and memory dumps. The difference in velocity between a developer who can do these things, and one who can't is immense.\n\n**Find the true requirements**\n\nDon't trust your managers, PM's, or customers to be able to convey what needs to be done. Communication is the hardest part of the whole job and it's everyone's responsibility to be engaged and active in the conversation. That means you are speaking up, asking questions, understanding the why and how. When appropriate, suggest alternate solutions that make more sense than what comes out of the requirements machine. You'll save yourself a huge headache and a lot of time over massaging semi-correct requirements to be a functional product.\n\n**Code isn't always the answer**\n\nTo a hammer every problem is a nail, and to a programmer every solution is code. But what makes a really great developer is getting out of the IDE every once in a while and getting a birds-eye view on the whole operation. There are mountains of tools available to us that aren't code for solving problems. It's all programming at the end of the day, just with different primitives. But if you can meet a business requirement with a $20 off the shelf solution that already exists... define a process that eliminates your requirement at no cost, or hook up some existing set of systems in such a way that you solve what would otherwise have been a large problem with little to no code that's a big win.\n\nRemember, every line of code you write needs to be tested. Kept up to date with changing requirements and compliance demands. Maintained for the lifetime of the product. Code is expensive.\n\n**Cut out the distractions**\n\nYeah, I know, you work better while listening to youtube and passively grinding your firemaking cape isn't really that much of an attention suck. You're still getting work done. But... how about just doing those things later because regardless about how you *feel* about your distractions impact, they are slowing you down. Humans aren't particularly good at multi-tasking. And while you might be moving forward, you won't know what things you wouldn't have missed without the distraction. I listen to music without lyrics while I code, that's my personal compromise. Over the long term of many years examining myself it's evident that I'll be less productive with anything more engaging than that in front of me.\n\n**Collaborate**\n\nI wish I saw more of this. Especially in a world where many of us are working remotely, or in isolated cubical/office spaces. All of the things I've described above are easier to do when you don't do them alone. Get a teammate who's on the same page as you in terms of increasing velocity by taking your work seriously and then do it together. Sit side by side and engage in coding 'sprints' where you push for continuous progress for 20 minute periods at a time. Then rest, then repeat. Have pair programming blocks, where you work together on the same problem for an hour. Give space for 'state of the code' discussions where you just talk about what engineering problems you're encountering, and what choices or projects might change things to improve the engineering environment.\n\n**Take breaks**\n\nAfter so many hours of cranking out solutions, you'll get fatigued and slow. I remember grinding in school, getting stuck and getting frustrated near the deadline for a project. I'd spend 4 hours making meaningful progress, and then 8 just being confused, tired, and frustrated. Only to get 6 hours of sleep, wake up in the morning and look at my project and suddenly it was all clear. Take your breaks. Eat regular meals. Get exercise. Be well. When you're in a healthy state your brain will function better.",

You code create scripts that do all of that automatically for you!\". And of course she told me that it takes too much time to learn programming and it's easier to do it manually. I tried to convince her that this kind of mindset is a short-term mindset because all the time that she spends doing things manually adds up over time and if she learns to program, yes, it definitely takes some time but over time it pays off big time. I convinced her successfully.\n\nJust like you, she felt dumb many times. One time she was trying to solve a problem and after 20 minutes of suffering on what appeared to be the right solution, she asked me to help her and in less than 5 seconds of looking at her code I told her \"You forgot to close the function here. You're missing a brace!\". She typed the missing brace and everything worked as expected. She started crying and just like you, feeling that this whole coding thing is not for her. I told her, \"I'm not a genius, I'm just doing this for a very long time! You were born in 1992 and I started coding in 1992 so you can't even compare my skill to yours, you started one month ago!\"\n\nLong story short, just stick to it and focus on the fundamentals of programming and I'm pretty sure you will manage. I'm currently running a pre-launch sale of a coding course that tackles exactly those fundamentals so in case you want to check it out, ping me in private.",

It's good to copy once or twice and follow along tutorials to get a baseline, youve got that part down, but you aren't proving you've learned how to build shit by doing that. \n\nYou need to reframe how you go about this and treat it like learning an actual spoken language. You learn some nouns and verbs (keywords in programming), then you learn some concepts and combine those with your vocabulary (grammar), but you will never be able to speak with just that (speaking = programming).\n\n\nYou can pass a Japanese test and technically \"know\" Japanese this way, but you'll never be able to express your own thoughts to a native. In the same way you can't program your own apps. \n\n\nIf you want to progress beyond the beginners at your stage and speed up your learning, paradoxically you need to slow down. Pause the \"studying\" and \"learning\" you're doing for now and do the same thing youd do for learning a spoken language. Take what you know and form your own sentences and evaluate where you get lost and what you need to learn more of. \n\n\nSpeaking a language = coding a project. Coding is NOT and will not ever be the most difficult part about being a programmer. Coding is hard for beginners and anyone that tells you that coding is the hard part likely does not understand what programming actually is. Build something, and when you finish build something else. Occasionally rebuild something youve already built, maybe add some new tricks youve learned to speed the process up or add features you were unable to the first time.\n\n\nAnd \"i can't build anything yet\" is not an acceptable answer. Day one of a spoken language course you learn how to say \"hello\", day one of a coding course you learn how to say \"Hello World\". Thats a project in the same way that a simple sentence in Japanese is. It's not impressive, but it is by definition a project. Now add complexity to your app. Can you print \"something besides Hello World? Can you make it print that new phrase 10 times? Can you print out what a user types? Can you make that phrase print 10 times? Can you take in more than one string of user input? \n\n\nIf you know how to do those things, you should be able to bang your head against a wall and build a calculator. A little more complicated than \"Hello World\" and takes quite a bit more work, but building it is a lot more feasible than you think. \n\n\nCoding isnt hard. But it takes practice. You've studied, thats great, but you need to put the books aside and go to the gym and get some reps in.",

Knowledge acquisition doesn’t always require understanding before exposure, often repetitive exposure to things that don’t make sense is the foundation of knowledge. It’s how we all learned to speak. Our brains are actually designed to work this way.\n\nSo if you are retyping programming basics like loops, syntax, the use of built in methods, turning an array into a map, the elements of a form that go together, and the js methods that move the info from the front end to the back end, the shape of classes and functions, event listeners and their methods, etc… I think that stuff is okay to copy as long as you type it out line by line. It’s hard to tell while you’re doing it, but you are learning things just by transposing them from the screen through your keyboard. You will inevitably miss a symbol or a letter and you’ll have to scan through and figure out what went wrong. This will help you gain deeper understanding. \n\nEventually you see the patterns. Seemingly disconnected confusing things start to become connected and organized. \n\nAt its heart programming is us training ourselves to be conscious of subconscious steps. Like we never have to think of every individual step of putting on a t-shirt. We just know how to do it. I believe when we program our brain begins to subconsciously understand what is happening which is why (after it clicks) sometimes coding can feel like magic, and why we have to reread and relearn code we wrote two weeks ago. \n\nIf you find yourself copying something that looks familiar too often I would say take some time and focus on the use of that thing by itself. \n\nBut  if you copy paste you’re mostly not learning.",

That’s why it’s so important to stay connected, even on low-energy days. Watch a CS video, read an article, or just mess with some code. The longer you’re away, the bigger the gap gets, and the harder it is to return, so you need to do something no matter however small that might be. For God sake even just opening vs code & browsing through the code for couple of min also counts.\nAlso,  a little arrogance is actually useful. Not just belief in yourself, but that competitive arrogance of “I want to be better than others.” When everything else feels low, that pride can keep you grinding. And don’t underestimate daydreaming. Imagine what you’ll be once you finish this project or learn that new concept. Sure, it’s mental masturbation, but it feeds your feedback loop and keeps the fire alive.\n\nAll these factors — discipline, arrogance, dreaming, consistency — they don’t always burn equally strong. Sometimes one carries you, sometimes another. But they only start working for you once you actually start and keep going.

You don't need to collect languages. They come and go (from your mind) easily. What does \"finished C\" and \"doing C++\" mean to you? You learn the syntax and semantics of a language to *use* it. If you've put effort into learning some C, you should write some software in it. You'll retain very little unless you do. It doesn't make much sense to memorise a bunch of things about a language that you then abandon, just to repeat that with the next one, and so on...\n\nAs for C++, what are you planning on doing with it and why can't you do it in C to cement your existing knowledge? If you wanted to learn C++ you could have learned the modern flavour without C first, though it won't do you any harm and there's plenty of transfer between the two (as much as some don't like to admit it).\n\nIn summary, forget your rule, slow down, choose what you learn in a targeted manner, and commit to using it for a while to test your understanding and make it stick.",

C has a variety of uses, one of which is that a few of the textbooks I'm interested in working through use C.  Another important reason for learning C is that it forces a programmer to think more \"lower level\" than other programming languages, and learning how a program interacts with an operating system to use hardware is a useful thing for programmers to learn.  Not essential, I believe, but useful.  I intend to learn C++ after, because I like that C++ is object oriented, and I'm also interested in competitive programming.\n\nAs far as you 80/20 rule, I think the way you described it sounds fishy.  Just like there is no royal road to geometry, there is no royal road to learning a computer programming language.  With that being said, I've heard people claim something along the lines of 80 percent of the total work done by a system is done by 20 percent of that system.  But the validity and applicability of a particular philosophy is not the point of this post.  I think a good, small(ish) collection of problems for either C or C++ can be found in the first chapter of Kernighan and Ritchie's book The C Programming Language.  The first chapter is a whirlwind tour of C, and there are about 25 exercises in it that covers enough of the language that the authors claim, and I'm paraphrasing, to get a programmer up and running in C.  Sounds like what you're interested in.  C++ is not C, but I suspect that you might be able to use C++ for those problems as well and get some similar out of it.  \n\nHope that helps.",

You have class time, homework, and that's pretty much it. If you have questions, you ask in class.\n\nUniversities are different. Professors and TAs offer office hours, and you really, really should take advantage of them. Do the homework, go discuss it in office hours to just see what they say. Most of the time, the person having office hours will be completely alone and you won't be interrupting anyone else's time, because *no one seems to do this*. \n\nI took a graduate level Computability and Complexity class in my senior year. Another student and I learned the professor liked latte's. We'd buy him one and go to every single office hour he offered. We'd talk to him about the class, get extra help and insight into the material, and it was absolutely critical. Without that I would've failed the class, but I ended up getting an A.\n\nAnyway, that's just general college advice. For CS specifically, I'd say find the things you're interested in, whatever you're passionate about, and pursue those in classes if they're offered, and if not, find professors who can point you in the right direction (again, office hours!) to help you pursue them as side projects. \n\nI wouldn't worry about trying to learn as many languages as you can. Pick like two or three and learn them really well. Something systems level like C/C++/Rust, something very high level like Python, and something like Java/Go/C#/some other garbage collected but very productive language.  \n\nOne of the best things I did was to become a grader. It was sort of like a TA position, but we just graded projects and held office hours, we didn't teach classes. If something like that is available, I'd highly encourage doing it. It's one thing to learn how to debug your own code. Learning how to work through 30 other people's code? That's an irreplaceable experience. I mean I was paid to learn how to read and evaluate other people's code, and that is such an important skill. It's something they don't really tell you will be important, but when you're working in an existing codebase and with other people who are also contributing to it, you'll need to not only be able to write your own new code, but also to read other code that someone else wrote (and also your own 2 to 5 to 10 years later when you're a completely different person).",

Any large enough codebase is very  arcane at first. At a job, you have team mates that can help you make sense of it. You know you understand the code when you start to see what could be changed.\n\nThat being said, there are actual practices that can be part of the team style that will result in messy and unreadable spaghetti given enough time. The thing where you said ”we just override stuff in CSS” rings some alarms in my head, but it all depends on how and why things are overridden. Are you overriding stuff because they were defined inside a library code? Could be good, you don’t want to modify anything inside the node_modules folder, and you being weirded out by it is just inexperience. Are you constantly overriding whatever the previous css was and now you have 5 classes that aren’t used anywhere? Really bad, your whole css packbcould be a giant mess.\n\nAbout the JS being hard to trace and split every where… it’s also really hard to infer if you are right or wrong here without looking at the codebase you are criticising. Keep in mind you haven’t sent it all yet, and sometimes, once you see the logic and decisions that are behind a certain way they organized their files, what looks messy to you now becomes manageable. Large code bases will take time to grasp even with a team that can guide you thru it.\n\nWith the tutorials…. Are you really looking for ”how to make an endpoint” or are you still looking for ”how to create the thing in my head exactly”? Here’s the deal: authentication: that’s an endpoint. ORMs: do you understand what and ORM is? You can build endpoints without databases, but for a project that DOES something useful, it rarely makes sense to do so. And with databases come a lot of boilerplate that you have to code every time but really would rather not…\n\nI understand the desire to study things separately, but a lottor tutorials mash things together because they make sense together. Keep in mind that in the simplest form, an endpoint is just an ”URL” that sends you back something specific. You can make just send ”hello” back, or some hard coded object and not setup a whole database and ORM for it. That however, teaches you about endpoints, but not exactly why you’d want to use an endpoint for. Now if I slap authentication into it…. I’m teaching you not only ”using endpoints for authentication is common”, but also how to do it in an ok way, and that you probably dont want anyone accessing a database without authentication. There’s a chance here the tutorials you are watching aren’t great. A 2minutes tutorial really barely has time to show some very specific example, let alone explain the reasons for anything. I can recommend blue collar coder tutorials. He will explain why he’s doing this thing this way, so later you can decide for yourself if his approach works for your project or not.\n\nThe deeper you go and the more knowledgeable you are, the less tutorials will help you. Once you dive into advanced enough territory, there’s no ”find a video who shows me how robust this library in this way”. You either have to find tutorials that fit for parts of what you want to do, like how do I use this specific ORM or dive into docs and leave tutorials behind altogether.",

First thoughts is I need to have two sets of words, I need to display them and I need to take input. Maybe a database? A gui? Do I know any database? No, okey... do I know any gui? No, do I learn one? Where do I get the words? Do I input them? Do I use any cloud solution?\n\nThis never ending circle of questions, or you could just write a function that takes a word of language L and a word of language K then it returns true if it's correct. Internally it finds the L word in list L and checks if K word matches the word at the same index in list K. This is your core mechanic AND database. You can go even lower and make sure you can match strings at all.\n\nGUI? Once you start considering libraries and frameworks... thats a whole can of worms on it's own...print to terminal first. Solve it \"yourself\" as much as possible first because many 3rd party software is not helpful for you yet. They are complicated and huge because they can handle so much.. add them later.\n\nWordlist? Hardcode it, then use csv or json. Same as above, switch when it is more work not switching.\n\nThe app prototype is done and now you have a much better chance of planning anything or finding answers.\n\nDon't be afraid to write bad code. It's much better to \"fail early\". I recommend googling that term.",

(I joke, I like Rust overall).\n\nOnce you get into writing things the Rust way (TM?) you get to worry less (but not forget about completely) memory bugs that can cause crashes or be exploited. The benefits are many and varied. Rust also has a nice type system if you're into that, and nice language-level support for tagged/discriminated unions, and matching. If you're into function style/idioms, you'll feel at home, but if you're used to OOP there's plenty to recognise too, e.g. struct/impl/traits. I've often said my ideal general purpose HLL would be a cross between C and Rust (yes, I know about Zig and Odin), because I like both but find Rust annoying to write (especially when code involves lots of explicit lifetime annotation) and visually quite information-dense (IMO).\n\nI much prefer C, me/my teams rarely have most of the issues that the Rust compiler guards against, but nobody who likes Rust believes you when you say that :) I like to configure debug and release builds from the get go, and use the sanitisers (address etc.) in debug always. I have a big list of flags I use for compilation config built up over the years. LSPs and a parser (e.g. treesitter) catch some typos (e.g. . instead of -> or missing a \\*/& etc.) too.\n\nRust has no bearing on your Azure cert AFAIK, and to be honest it hasn't seen massive uptake commercially (yet?). I know lots of businesses (previous employers or places friends work) that are still using C and/or C++ with no interest even in committing to writing new software in Rust, let alone rewriting anything existing, anecdotally. I say this to say that the Rust job market isn't what it is for other languages (e.g. your C#, Java, others like JS and Python) which are seeing lots of use in recent years.\n\nThere are also better languages if you want to learn how to manage memory freely, as Rust enforces it's particular model.\n\nTLDR; Learn Rust because you want to. Don't if you don't. You aren't disadvantaging yourself by not learning it, and it's fairly easily picked up if need be once you've been programming a while. It can be used to write fast, robust native software. I use ripgrep, fd, every day.",

Feel free to google those keywords yourself, but to start you could look at Vue.js for your frontend, Python’s Flask for your backend, and a NoSQL option like Firebase’s Firestore for your database.\n\nAlternatively, if you plan on running the website off of your computer, you could straight up just use file storage on your device as the database with CSV, JSON, or XML files.\n\nExplaining how all of these parts work together up front would turn this into an essay, but for reference I have not worked with web technology, HTML/CSS/JS, or Python in over a year and I have a solid prototype web app up and running after only a week (40hrs) of development time. All it takes is a lot of googling and some patience. You don’t need to know the entirety of each language to get this up and running, honestly just start developing and learn as you go.\n\nPS: please do not attempt to use AI to make this whole thing for you. It will make up functions that don’t exist and do many other incorrect things and the end result will be you bashing your head against a wall wondering why your website doesn’t work.

Later when you switch to the other, the 80% you've already learned will still apply, and you just need to learn how to do things differently in another language.",

You contribute to open source because you've got expertise worth contributing. You don't have to be an expert, but a beginner is unlikely to be able to even understand the codebase and the outstanding issues well enough to make useful contributions.\n\nPeople will sometimes highlight \"this would be a good issue to work on for a beginner\" but they don't mean a beginner programmer - they mean an experienced programmer who is new to that open source project or even new to open source in general. But you should probably be a capable programmer *first*. Again, you don't need to be an expert, but have some confidence at least.\n\nWalk before you try to run.",

Here's my suggestions for what's been helping me.\n\n\nFirst start your own open source project. Work on a project you want to build, but look up the work flow and follow a basic structure large repos might use and make a CONTRIBUTING file based on some real ones from other projects. You can use it to learn forking, how do write an issue, how to write a PR, how to merge commits. When you're doing it make sure you write everything like you're writing it for someone else and tag any really easy things with good first issue. These will often get picked up by others. Then you'll get a chance to see the basics of what maintainers are looking for in other people's code, and you'll get experience with light collaboration with others. \n\n\n\n\nAfter doing this for a while you'll feel way more confident in how to contribute. Then you just have to find issues that are within your scope. That's easier said than done, but I'd look for medium sized projects that aren't as well know. At that point you'll have some experience and you can look to helping out in larger and larger projects.\n\n\n\n\nIt's not a fast process, but I've found it rewarding so far.",

In the former days, this was an actual ROM, now it is usually some form of erasable programmable memory, like an EEPROM.\n\nThe BIOS then has all the code to carry out the POST (Power On Self Test), plus libraries/functionality to talk with the various hardware components, and the code to then start, in case of a PC, the Operating System, of which the boot-loader is stored in a certain place on the hard drive (SSD, nVme, etc) of the computer.\n\nIn case of the modern UEFI BIOS, this system is usually also stored on the computer's hard drive, but also exists in a storage on the main board so that when you change the hard drive, the computer can still boot.\n\nA good start to understand how everything of this plays together is to look into Microcontrollers, like the 8031/8051, Atmel (Arduino) as they are basically the same as a PC minus the operating system.",

So, doing good at SQL will open doors to data science, business analysis, database performance work, and in general will make you more valuable for every developer team in the future.\n\nAnother one such \"language\" is regular expressions. Python may not be a good language to learn and use them because AFAIK it lacks special syntax support for them, but Ruby, Rust, JavaScript have better syntax for them. Learning regexes *well* will help you work with unstructured data, extract data form text, logs, do data migration between systems, and do quick changes to text files including some advanced search-and-replace operations in your code editor. It's a very good supplemental skill to have.\n\nLearning Shell scripting is my third recommendation. Learning how to combine programs together, build pipelines, learning SSH tunneling - all of this will be useful over decades, too.\n\nA large pert of programmer's work is spent outside of their primary language, so getting comfortable with the world besides `if`s and `for`s is always a good idea.",

If after almost 5 years, and you can’t find the spare time to study coding this might not be the profession for you.\n\nI know very little based on your post about your current skillset, but if it as bad as you make it out to be, you might be better off going a product manager route for your upcoming project. These roles are always undervalued and under represented in big team projects in university and schools. Some people might partake in this role, but usually the team doesn’t take the role seriously. But that is usually the way it is with product managers - they have to make themselves useful, so that the team can see the purpose in the role.\n\nEven though you can’t code, I’m sure that’s a lot of things that you’ve caught on about - use that knowledge to support the team in every possible way. Communication is key - as it is in any successful endeavor.\n\nBut you won’t learn enough in a month  - it is simply not enough time.\n\nBut if you do choose to study hard and try to make lost time, here’s a few suggestion for you:\n\nStop focusing on fancy called examples or guides from people that tell you that this kind of projects will get you jobs - find something that is within your scope of capabilities; even if this means this is simply a small blogging website or a simple web crawler or even a calculator. Finish that project - and do not use AI tools to complete it.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. AI tools are extremely powerful and in the industry we use them daily. But at least where I come from we have a saying, that the AI is only as good as your own understanding - but understanding doesn’t come, unless you put down the groundwork.\n\n\nI’m sorry if this is harsh, but I truly wish you the very best in the future.",

Circles is loser talk!\n* Stole animated gifs from another implementation of this program\n* Created 2D array, filled it with gifs. Displayed them\n* Break for lunch\n* Google `how to catch mouse clicks`\n* Click away happily for a few minutes\n* Use some advanced math (uh, division and modulo) to convert a point on the screen to an element of the 2D array\n* Change the code to say \"You clicked square x, y, which contains a blue blob\"\n* Use my advanced CS degree to do find all the blobs of the same color connected to this blob (flood fill)\n* etc\n\nI can go on for a lot longer, but I hope I've made the point.

The \"learn → stuck → forget\" cycle is brutal and honestly super common, even for people who've been coding for years.\n\n\n\nHere's what I think might help break that cycle - you need to pick ONE language and stick with it for the full month. Don't jump between JS, Java, whatever. Pick Python or JavaScript and commit.\n\n\n\nBut here's the key thing - instead of trying to build complete projects from scratch, start by modifying existing code. Find simple programs on GitHub, download them, and just... mess with them. Change variables, add print statements everywhere to see what's happening, break things on purpose. This way you're not hitting that \"how do I make a grid\" wall because the grid already exists.\n\n\n\nThe AI thing is tricky. I actually built Writingmate partly because I saw people struggling with this exact issue. Instead of asking AI \"how do I make a grid\", try asking it to explain existing grid code line by line. Make it your tutor, not your coder.\n\n\n\nAlso - and this might sound weird - try coding the same simple thing multiple times. Like, build a basic calculator 5 times over 5 days. By the 3rd time you'll start remembering the patterns, by the 5th it'll feel natural.\n\n\n\nOne month is actually plenty of time if you focus. Pick Python, find 10 simple projects on GitHub, spend 3 days each just understanding and modifying them. You'll be way more prepared than you think.\n\n\n\nThe forgetting part gets better once you have that foundation, trust me.",

I will say that generally, to learn and understand something, people need that thing to be connected to their existing understanding of the world. For example, I didn't really \"get\" the quadratic equation until a teacher did a proof of it, so I could see how to get there from what I already knew.\n\nThe other big way to connect new concepts to existing understanding is through analogy, but different people have different existing knowledge to connect to. For example, most math students wouldn't be helped if you said \"domain is the set of all valid arguments for a pure function, and range is the set of all valid return values\". In your case, though, that may be a useful analogy. So for the function: int.ToString(), the domain is all integers from - 2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, and the range is the set of all strings that match the regex \"\\-?\\d{1,10}\"",

On some platforms like macOS or Android you could write an app that's 99% C with a tiny bit of another language to set things up and write Pong.

It's the foundational language used behind the scenes of everything so it's really important to know - but it's not the main language used to build apps and the software people actually use.\n\nMy advice would be to start with Harvard's CS50x.

Most companies will have designers who create mockups/wireframes for you to implement. You won't usually be designing from scratch unless you're at a tiny startup where everyone wears 10 hats. Your job would be taking those designs and turning them into actual working code.\n\nThe fact that you've got CSS, HTML and most of JS down is solid. Frontend is way more forgiving when you're learning because you can actually see what you're building instead of staring at terminal outputs all day.\n\nAt Metana we see students make this exact transition all the time. Backend concepts like databases, server architecture, APIs etc can be overwhelming at first but frontend lets you build confidence with visual feedback. Plus the job market for frontend is pretty decent right now.\n\nMy advice would be to pick one path and stick with it for now instead of jumping around. If styling feels more natural than wrestling with Express, go frontend. You can always learn backend later once you're comfortable with one side of things. The whole \"full stack\" thing sounds cool but honestly most people end up specializing anyway.\n\nAlso stop using Mimo and start building actual projects.

Over time you get a better ratio of joy to frustration, but to start with it's hard.\n\nYeah, that describes it pretty well. Good to know I'm not the only one.\n\n>Sorry, but that is stupid. You're going into massive debt so you ought to go to every lecture, every tutorial, use the facilities extensively and engage with the faculty as much as you can - that's what you're paying for. Uni is fun, but you need to work your ass off too.\n\nIt IS stupid but luckily I have free college education in my country so all I lose is time.\n\nMade the post right after failing at a problem for hours and being extremely frustrated. Just the usual \"Am I really cut out for this?\" thoughts.",

        "body": "It depends on the scale of the project and the needs of the customer. Though very often there’s multiple phases and kinds of documentation. Consider “gathering requirements” this in itself is some documentation you want to create before you start developing. You probably also want to pin down any quality attributes and relevant SLO/SLAs, and a workable architecture or design for your software. Basically you start by producing a pile of documentation that you reference throughout your development, and while developing you may produce documentation about certain methods or functions, or a quirk of a third party system you interact with, and so on, which will help the future developers (likely you) maintain the project. You’ll also want “user facing documentation” that the people who use the software you produce can use to help them get the most out of it or answer questions for them when they stumble across a workflow quirk.\n\nFurther I consider the value of a SWE to not just be code output, but “knowledge output”, so alongside development or while making architectural decisions or soliciting requirements, or after getting user feedback, they should also be learning things about the domain and ideally producing some documentation that can help the whole team understand the why and how behind certain domain-specific things. Code is almost inherently technical debt, and knowledge is the only thing that lets you pay it down.\n\nIt sounds like a lot, but all of it can usually fit in an agile sprint or whatever. And to some extent it depends on what level of developer you are, Jr. dev will likely not be getting customer requirements, setting quality attributes and SLOs, nor drafting architecture. However, a Jr. dev will likely be expected to write some unit documentation for the code they create, and may be expected to write user-facing documentation for the feature they implement.",

You'll start learning differences (or lack thereof) between class vs functional approaches, why type systems exist, async/await, etc. This too will be more crap.\n\nThen after a while, you can start trying to build a backend for the site. Maybe start with Node and Express because it's relatively simple. Then hook in a database. Learn about the pitfalls, like string sanitization, authentication handling, etc.\n\nThen start looking at libraries and frameworks. NextJS and React are popular.\n\nAlso MDN is a great resource.\n\nI've been programming for over 10 years in various languages, stacks, and contexts. I learn something new pretty regularly.

Bear in mind that if you do things like wildcard queries, you will end up scanning the entire \"users\" table on every search.\n\nIf you care about scaling to large numbers of users, then you'll want to use a full-text search engine that can use an index for efficient searching.\n\nI'm not familiar with Prisma, but it seems to be a wrapper around Postgres, and Postgres supports full-text search using the `tsvector` and `tsquery` types. This allows you to create an index on a *tokenized* field, so that searches can efficiently find only the rows containing those tokens. You can customize the tokenizer to do things like approximate searches, where the tokens are partial words instead of complete words. All of this is relatively straightforward in Postgres, but I'm not sure whether/how Prisma exposes it.\n\nIf you need even larger scale, and you don't want your database to become a bottleneck for searching, then you'll want to use a search engine that's separate from your DB, such as Elasticsearch or Solr. This adds a lot of complexity because whenever the data in your DB changes, you have to synchronize those changes to your search index.",

A service must be designed with the intent to be runnable in multiple instances for it to be considered horizontally scalable, not all applications meet these criteria, and once they meet them, other services they depend on (e.g. databases, queues, weird disk based sharing) must also be able to meet demand, or else the service will just bottleneck outside of its control.\n\nResilience can be broken down into three categories, what happens when  the service breaks, what happens when the services around it break, and what happens when the service is used incorrectly - all three must be covered for it to be resilient, and cloud helps with none of these.\n\nWhat you probably have in mind is *availability,* which yes, load balancing a service which supports it in the cloud, whether automatically or manually, does to an extent solve availability (*to an extent is doing a lot of heavy lifting here).* This is what happens when *one or more* instances of your service are no longer available.\n\nSecurity is not only authorization and authentication, but also what information I can receive from your system while being a legitimate user, whether I can abuse timing, delays, your concurrency model, false requests, rollbacks and a thousand other things.\n\nHowever, most job postings don't really mean all this, it's just a fun thing to write these days.",

        "body": "Great answer from u/disposepriority !\n\nFor my two pence, I'd like to add that, as much as the internet is only as fast as the slowest connection between you and the other end, the same can be said for \"resilient, scalable and secure\" software... if the fundamental processing units (the deployed code) are flaky and buggy, you are going to find stuff dying, then AWS for example will trigger an EB/EC2/Docker restart depending on what deployment route you set up, that will be blue/green usually so least disruptive but still, until the new box is switched live, users are left running the faulty one!\n\nSo, from the bottom up it helps if good development practices regarding tests, integrations tests, staging servers to test prior to production release etc, these are all factors in a \"reliable\" system.\n\nAs for **scalable**, depends on your needs: horizontal scaling is easy enough with AWS to trigger more boxes up under heavy loads, but again the onus is on you to make sure you can handle sessions properly, JWT based authentication usually makes that a no brainer but if you are using database sessions then that adds an extra step I guess but all normal stuff these days, plenty of best practices guides out there and from AWS; they have documentation on everything but it can be hard to find / hard to digest at times.\n\n**Vertical** scaling with AWS is easier if you use something like Terraform, we have a guy does that for us. Usually vertical scaling isn't an issue for us, we use Django and Celery and they run on separate instances to reduce load on the main API server, for that we use RabbitMQ in the mix. I can't remember the last we needed to tweak a box specification. We run everything via ECR/ECS, the AWS Docker solution.\n\n**Performant**: Well to some extent this goes back to initial software design, choosing the most efficient algorithms, libraries and your own data structures. For example, me being an big fan of Lisp, Haskell etc I tend to use \\`deque\\` instead of the stock Python list as it handles certain types of insertions faster than the List (possible premature by me?), then you can hand it back as  a list() if you want later.\n\n[https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)\n\nand I have added this: [https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity)\n\n**Secure**: We use at rest encryption for our RDS instances, plus certain data models have custom load and save to perform encryption prior to sending fields to the database for double protection, using the SECRET\\_KEY value.\n\nAlso, we use asymmetric encryption on the JWT token, using the AWS Parameter Store to manage all keys, our environment configurations, TaskDefinitions etc are all setup to reference the keys so that they are available to Django at runtime through a simple AWS API call, and some are pushed into the running environment as we use \\`decouple.config()\\` quite a lot as well.\n\nSo, that's what we do!",

The platform can do it, no stress, but whether the app can handle it is up to the app. If you slap an old stateful app into kubernetes and make more replicas of it, you're pretty likely to get bad behaviour, as in erroneous responses or crashes.\n\nWe had high availability designs for apps before cloud providers, they were just a bit more of a PITA to get the other replicas for.\n\nOne guide to getting there is the [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/). The guide might look a bit weird to those of us who think those are just normal apps, and work with gitops and distroless containers on a daily basis.\n\n> And would using the cloud platform's built-in authentication and authorization services be enough to ensure security?\n\nYeah, nah. You can still leak your credentials and do lots of stupid shit. Vibe coders do it all the time. You need to have some idea of what authn and authz means, _why_ you do it, and which bits of information can go where. If you think the cloud services provide all the security you need and then push sensitive information out to any client, you've fucked up.\n\nSecurity is also something of an eternal cat-and-mouse game. Like some algorithms need to pretend to be slow just to limit their vulnerability to timing attacks. Security is an entire rabbit hole of its own.\n\n> I also see job postings that want experience designing \"performant\" software. Aren't you always trying to make code as efficient as possible? What is performant software and how would software not be performant?\n\nSoftware is non-performant for a whole host of reasons, and getting it to be performant isn't just one thing. One thing is bad [big-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), but people also do stuff like bad structuring of network calls, and to some extent choosing the wrong language (program design usually matters a lot more than language choice).",

        "body": "I'm going to disagree with the other two posters a *bit*, and post my own definition. Firstly, you absolutely, 100% should learn classes. They are used everywhere in every facet of programming, *including* Frontend Dev. Modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Lit, etc. use them, so they're absolutely necessary to have at least a basic grasp of.\n\nI'd also disagree that the \"description of an object is called a CLASS\". This is like...90% accurate, but there's a small bit of distinction that I think is important.\n\n# Classes and Objects\n\nFirstly, let's define what the word \"object\" means. I like to think of an object in programming as a *noun*; it's a \"thing\". It has can have some **adjectives** that describe it (it's \"old\" or \"blue\") and it can have some **verbs** that it can do (it can \"drive\" or \"honk\"). It's also got a name usually that describes it (so we can refer to that \"thing\"), and often times we can say that it's a particular **kind** of thing. \n\nNow, instead of using the words \"adjective\", \"verb\", and \"kind\", let's replace those with more programmy words:\n - `property`: properties are the adjectives. They describe something about the object. Some of those properties can be changed (I may get taller or shorter as I age); other properties cannot change (I will always have been born in my hometown; that cannot change). Generally speaking, properties don't \"do\" anything; they're just descriptors. Each property has a \"key\" (what it is) and a value. For example, our car has a property with key \"color\" and value \"blue\".\n - `method`: Methods are the verbs, and they usually have a pair of parentheses somewhere in their name. I can `program()`. I can `write(message)` (write a message). I cannot `fly()` (that's not one of my methods!).\n - `class`: The class of an object is, roughly speaking, its _type_. I am a human (my class is Human). The `old`, `blue` thing that can `drive()` is an object of type `Car`. All objects of a particular type are defined as having certain methods and properties. Classes can also be thought of as \"templates\" for objects. I want an object that fits the template \"car\" (i.e., does things a car can do), so I'll use the Car class.\n\nHere's an example of a class in JavaScript:\n\n```\nclass Car {\n  constructor(color, age){\n    //roughly speaking here, `this` refers to the object we're talking about.\n    this.color = color;\n    this.age = age;\n  }\n\n  drive() {\n    alert('vroooom!');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd to use this class, I'd do something like this:\n\n```\nconst myCar = new Car('blue', 'old');\n\nconsole.log(myCar.color);//'blue'\n```\n\nSo why would I disagree that the description of an object is a class? Well, in describing that old blue car, I'd... well I'd describe it exactly that. An old, blue car. _However_, the adjectives \"old\" and \"blue\" are _not part of the class_! Instead, they're values (see above). Instead, a class describes a _template_ for an object, not that actual, specific object. Every person alive has an `age` property and a `placeOfBirth` property, but mine is almost certainly different from, say, yours. \n\n# Why\n\nClasses allow us to organize our data in a paradigm of programming known as Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It's not the _only_ paradigm, but it's a pretty popular one. Classes:\n - Allow us to define a particular behavior _once_ and then reuse that behavior\n - Can be \"extended\". For example, I might have a `Pet` class with properties like `hungerLevel` or methods like `makeSound()`, and then I might \"extend\" that class with something like a `Dog` class (with a `bark()` method), or a `Fish` class (with a `splash()` method). Again, this allows us to define certain, common behaviors only once!\n\nThe first point is particular important. Imagine if every time a person signed up for FaceBook, a team of programmers had to write functions to deal with that person's account. Oh, /u/Maleficent_Speech289 signed up? We'll need to write a `login()` and `getPictures()` and `postMessage()` method for them! Instead, with classes, you can just say: \n\n```\nconst someUser = new User('Maleficent_Speech289');\nsomeUser.getPictures(); //this behavior is already defined, so we can just use it!\n```\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nYou absolutely, 100% need to know classes as a programmer. It doesn't matter if you're new, senior, or somewhere in between; you'll need to know them at some point, and it's never too early to start learning them. Anyone that hires you will expect you to have clean, structured code, and while there are other programming paradigms, OOP is one of the most popular to the point that it's kinda a \"default\".",

        "body": "In JS, a class, aka object, is not really an object, it is ***a prototype ***  This difference was emphasized in many older books but has been forgotten since around 2012.   The last book I know of that adheres to this differentiation though the author did not explain the difference at all was the book Javascript the Good Parts by Douglas Crawford.  \n\nYou should think of a prototype as a ***generalized object/class***, it is a ***meta-class*** so to speak.   This was something discussed in a very old book called The Art of the Metaobject Protocol by Gregor Kiczales.   \n\nA typical object is very easy to understand as others have no doubt explained to you already.  It is basically a list of data and a list of methods that operates on those data and those data only.   You can create a new type of object from an existing object by inheriting all of its data and methods + nee ones you specified.  You should think in your mind as a circle engulfed by a bigger circle where the smaller circle is the old and the big circle now containing the smaller circle is the new.  \n\nThis is pretty much all you can do with objects if JS were really an object-oriented language like Java -- I wrote some stuff bashing Java the other day, people interested should search for the keyword Scratch in my comment history.  I basically argued why Scratch is better than Java, but that's just a click-bait title.  \n\nWith prototype, the relationship between the old and the new is not a circle in a circle but two circles connected by a line.  Yep, that's it.  We are done.\n\nTo truly appreciate the difference, you have to ask what happens during the ***construction of a new new-object***.  In the circle-in-circle model, you simply get another circle-in-circle.  \n\nHowever in JS, creating another circle-line-circle new-object can be done in ***two ways***, hence all the weird constructors in JS.  When you use the keyword 'class' you are creating a brand new circle-line-circle.  This is the standard method since ECMA6.  However there is an older method using the keyword 'new\".  \n\nWith 'new', you do not get another circle-line-circle, you get a new circle attached to the existing circle-line-circle, and the relationship is a triangle.  The you have circle-line-Circle-line-circle where Circle represents the old-object and the two 'circle's are the created new-objects. \n\nWhy does this matter?  This means both child (new-objects) share the same parent.  And either one can ***modify the parent's data or add new methods to the parent*** and that information will be propagated to the other child.  This is an important feature because it means you can modify the parent ***at run time.***  You can use this for all sorts of purposes.  \n\nIt would take too long to explain all the things you can do with this, just consult the book I mentioned or use your imagination.  \n\nI do want to mention something that is not in the book and I do not believe it is implemented anywhere.  In JS at least you can do it pretty easily.   Imagine now you go to the new 'class' constructor and you use that to create another circle-line-Circle-line-cicrle, now you have two families of the same objects, but they can follow different ***dynamic*** paths during program run time to become something else entirely.  One obvious application would be for games where you have different creatures from different families but as they evolve, they can split off from the main tree.  But, it can even go back through its ancestor tree and start ***rewriting history.***\n\nAnyway, this is long enough.\n\ne:  JS was originally derived from Scheme and the book was written for LISP based language which is the root of Scheme.  The creator of JS wanted to create a Scheme language to be used as the scripting language for the then best browser Netscape.  However, Java had just taken off and was seen as the future of the programming world.  So the investors of Netscape insisted on a ***java-like*** language thinking it would make JS compatible with Java in the future.  \n\nObviously you should never let non-tech people make tech decisions.  So the JS creator took the matter into his own hand and created a ***java-look-alike***.  It looks like Java but it has nothing to do with Java, it is way better because it runs on Scheme under the hood.   Yes, that's all it is.  He took a Scheme engine and created a cosmetic layer over it.  This was how he created JS in 3 days.   And God took 7 days to create the Universe.  Not too shabby.",

Repeatedly search for the character `s1[0]` in `s2`\n2. For each match, it checks whether the substring of `s2` starting at that point actually equals `s1`\n\nThe trick is that instead of those steps being implemented directly as loops, they're implemented by calling methods on `std::char_traits<char>`, which in turn call the standard C library functions `memchr` and `memcmp`, respectively.\n\nAnd depending on the platform, those functions in turn can be implemented using highly-optimized assembly code, which is likely faster than anything you would write by hand in C++.  For instance, on x86_64 Linux with glibc, `memchr` has various different implementations using SSE2, AVX2 or EVEX SIMD instructions, depending on which CPU features are detected at runtime.",

        "body": "I can tell you my story. This was 15 years ago so it's not all applicable (IMO the bar is so unreasonably high now) but maybe it'll help.\n\nI graduated in 2010 with a business degree. We were still coming out of the Great Recession and I had no idea what was going to happen. I only managed to land a job because I played World of Warcraft with someone who lived in the same city and he offered to refer me.\n\nIt was a back office position, mostly trade support and compliance. Not riveting or lucrative stuff. At this point, I probably had two things going for me: I'd been working with computers in some capacity since I was 5, and I had recently done an internship where I was exposed to VBA and general scripting.\n\nAfter about 6 months on the job, I started playing around with VBA to automate parts of my daily tasks away. My manager was very supportive and so were my IT folks. After that, I snowballed because as I wrote scripts to automate my work away, I had more time to experiment. As I experimented, I collaborated with other teams to automate parts of their work.\n\nAfter a year, I got poached by a hedge fund. I learned a few more things, but it was a bad environment for me and I got fired inside of 3 months. Luckily, I had built my VBA skills enough that I got contracted to work on a year-long project at a large financial institution.\n\nAfter that project, I joined a consulting firm where I used my VBA knowledge to make Excel and PowerPoint do some incredibly complex things. After two years, I realized I needed more; I didn't want to stay in this niche and I saw the writing on the wall that this might all go away in the medium term. A friend from college I kept in touch with referred me to his company.\n\nThat was my first opportunity in a tech company. But I wasn't a software engineer, more of a \"solutions\" engineer. But I applied everything I learned into this new role. Except instead of VBA and Excel, it was Python scripts, PHP, SQL, and a bit of Bash. I also made sure to understand the ins and outs of our entire tech stack.\n\nTwo more years, I made my way into FAANG and haven't looked back since (I'm no longer in FAANG, but I'm still in tech, making more money than I ever thought I would).\n\nA few takeaways would be that networking is important, but it can take on many forms that are conducive to introverts (I'm one myself). How many people can say they got jobs through World of Warcraft? Another thing is, everyone runs their own race. I'd say the first 5 years of my career had little direction, and it wasn't until 7 years in that I thought to consider myself a software engineer at all, but each step I took was a calculated risk to incrementally get me there. I was always adjacent to the tech, to the code, and demonstrated value to the point where the developers started listening to me.\n\nIf you have an opportunity to now, I would encourage you to take whatever computer science courses you can to set yourself up. You can always teach yourself (as I did) but sometimes learning in a formal, structured setting has its benefits.",

That provider will almost certainly have its own rules about how sensitive data can be handled. For instance, I think credit card processors typically forbid you from logging credit card numbers in plaintext, and from storing CVV values in any way whatsoever.\n\nAlso consider whether your system falls within the scope of laws like the EU's GDPR or California's CCPA. These rules don't necessarily forbid you from logging sensitive personal data, but *if* you do log it, then you'd better have a process for scrubbing your logs in case somebody asks for their personal data to be deleted. And the GDPR has a very broad definition of what counts as \"personal\".",

If you *are* handling raw CHD - just don't, unless you've gone through the proper PCI auditing and certification process. \n\nAs for your question, I think the data you're talking about is valuable to keep for troubleshooting purposes but I don't think logs are an appropriate place to store it. You'll likely be better off saving your API responses into a database somewhere so that they're easily queryable in the event you actually need to use them for something.

I believe you need to know how a program runs before you start coding. Also, I believe beginners don't know how to pick an appropriate size project, and that if they start projects right away, they fail to learn the basics, in particular, control flow. \n\nThat is, imagine you're a debugger (a program that lets you go step by step through a program). Could you do that without using a computer, that is, if I gave you a simple program, can you determine what it does?\n\n**Alternate approach**\n\nMany others find the standard method I've described boring and therefore hard to motivate themselves. So, they do the following\n\n* Pick a project\n* Google a lot to find enough relevant information to code it\n* Learn enough about coding while doing the project\n\nWhat they like about this approach is they are building something which is something they *enjoy*. Does everyone enjoy this? No, they don't. But for those that do, this kind of thing is super rewarding.\n\nHowever, there are problems with this approach. The first is it works for only a small number of people. They're able to find answers to what they're looking for. They are able to learn enough about programming to accomplish the task.\n\nTo me, this is the equivalent of going to a foreign country and trying to pick up the language on the fly. You read a few common phrases, and trust the people know enough English and can decipher your accent enough that you get by. Some find that approach better than an academic approach where you learn how to conjugate verbs and learn grammatical structure.\n\nWhen someone opts to do projects, they want to find something interesting and cool, but even the most boring programs you can think of (Hangman, Tic-tac-toe) are quite difficult for most beginners, and they want to write 3D first person shooters or have some AI or do some image or video processing. There are things they think are pretty easy, and it's incredibly difficult.\n\nHowever, you'll see more people posting \"do projects\" than the more academic approach.",

For example on ARMv8 and above there are 4 privilege levels, which they call Exception Levels, with EL0 being the unprivileged level under which regular user applications execute, EL1 being intended for kernel supervisors, EL2 being intended for virtual machine hypervisors, and EL3 being intended for firmware security monitors.\n\nOn macOS you only have access up to EL2, and that requires using either the Hypervisor or Virtualization frameworks to create a virtualization environment (the Virtualization framework is a very high level virtual machine implementation on top of the Hypervisor framework), but you can run unrestricted EL3 code on all AArch64 Raspberry Pi models, so if you're interested in privileged bare-metal development, the Raspberry Pi is likely your best option. On the other hand, M4 Macs are already on ARMv9, which is pretty similar to ARMv8 as far as unprivileged code is concerned but significantly different for privileged code as many system registers were added, changed, and removed since ARMv8, plus the M4 in particular also has 512-bit Scalable Matrix Extension support, so depending on what you want to do, that may or may not be appealing to you.\n\nGeneral purpose AArch32 and AArch64 HTML documentation:\n\n* [ARMv6M, ARMv7, and ARMv8 assembly reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/latest/);\n* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 instruction set architecture](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/latest/)\n* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 system registers](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0601/latest/)\n\nDocumentation specific to the SoCs used by the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 and their derivatives:\n\n* [Cortex A72 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100095/latest/)\n* [Cortex A76 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100798/latest/);\n* [ Generic Interrupt Controller core reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0471/latest/);\n* [Generic Interrupt Controller v2 specific reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0048/latest/);\n* [PrimeCell 0111 UART](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0183/latest/);\n* [BCM2711 datasheet (Pi 4)](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/bcm2711/bcm2711-peripherals.pdf).\n\nOther resources:\n\n* [Bare-metal section of the Raspberry Pi forums (I help there sometimes under the same name as my reddit account)](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewforum.php?f=72&sid=de4c2c97b2b1372281ef64d6aed3dc5f);\n* [Tutorial that got my feet wet on AArch64 (I already had experience with AArch32 from decades ago)](https://www.rpi4os.com/);\n* [Rust HDMI audio driver that I made for the Pi 4 and 5](https://github.com/CodexTextor/rpi-hdmi) (will not work on the BCM2712 D0 stepping SoC used on models of the Pi 5 introduced after I wrote that code because the physical addresses of the hardware are different).\n\nNote that there's no public official documentation for the BCM2712 SoCs of the Raspberry Pi 5, so all my code targeting that platform is based on my own reverse-engineering research effort that included reading the official Linux driver code from Broadcom, messing around with hardware registers on Linux to figure out how they work with a proper driver, and deriving knowledge from my experience with and available documentation for the BCM2711 SoC of the Pi 4, since there was very little community work done on this front when I got my first Pi 5. If you go the Raspberry Pi route I also recommend getting the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe, installing OpenOCD, and reading [this thread](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=362067) on the Raspberry Pi forums for the OpenOCD script.\n\nAs for setting up the environment for native development on macOS, you don't really need much beyond Xcode's command-line tools, which you can install by typing:\n\n    xcode-select --install\n\nAnd then following the on-screen instructions.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Added Xcode command-line suggestion.",

Steve wrote the entire program in 6502 Assembly - on paper - then hand-translated everything in the numeric machine code that then could be loaded on the Apple computers. You can find plenty information on how Steve did it on the internet.\n\nWhen I learnt 8051 Assembly in my degree program we initially also learnt to hand-translate the Mnemonics into machine code and vice versa. Can highly recommend to learn that with simpler CPUs, like the 6502, the Zilog Z-80, or the 8051/8031/8080 series Microcontrollers.\n\nAssembly is just a 1:1 translation of machine code and therefore is closest to hardware.",

You're not learning these in parallel as a beginner, and you're not learning them well one after another within the next few years either. You need to pick one and focus on learning how to program as well as the syntax and semantics of the language. Once you're proficient you can move to other languages and benefit from the overlap/transfer between languages to pick them up faster. \n\nIf your goal is to learn C++, you can just start with that. I know several professional Python devs who can't write any C++, because the transfer is limited. The main benefit would be learning how to think about approaching programming problems within the Python VM bubble *before* meeting more fundamental concepts required to use C++. Plenty of people learn C++ as their first language though, so it's not totally inaccessible. You don't need to cover all features (probably couldn't!) and you can lean on the STL until you're ready to go deeper. Lots of people start with C, then move rather easily into C++ by mixing in some features and changing compiler.\n\nTime-wise, it depends on what you want to achieve and by when. 2 hours per day is probably not going to cut it if you want to go from beginner to employed in a junior role within 12 months, but is fine if you're in university for the next 3 years anyway, for example...",

Learning how to program is not learning the language itself, but simple concepts like functions/methods, structs/classes, variables, loops, etc and learning how to put those together in order to making something practical.\n\nOnce you understand these, you will learn almost any language with ease. (This is generally several months to a couple of years down the track).\n\nPython is in my opinion, a poor first choice because it takes shortcuts. Shortcuts that make it incredibly powerful and easy to use (Which is only true if you actually know how to program) but shortcuts that you should learn through C, C++ or Java, before skipping over in Python.  \nThings such as variable types, basic concepts of memory management/garbage collection, passing typed variables and returning typed variables, etc  \nAs well as proper compilation, etc  \nWhile you can do this in python, you are not forced to which is actually bad for learning.\n\nHowever, regarding the starting language you learn with it doesn't really matter which one you choose. You goal at this stage, is to simple learn how to structure variables, functions and loops properly to start training your mind to think like a programmer.  \nJust keep in mind, Python will skip some important concepts. Stuff you should know.\n\nJava and C++ are both great starting options. Java is simpler. But C++ will have more fundamentals that practically every language will use parts of.  \nAnd even if concepts like Pointers are scary. You can literally just ignore them while you learn until you get to that stage.",

You could feel that every single crypto asset is bullshit, but even then I’m not sure you could deny that selling services to people who want to use and trade those assets isn’t a real business. I think Pokémon card investing is bullshit, but if someone built a website to facilitate buying and selling of cards and took in real revenue, I’d still call that a real business. And all of those trading venues and lending venues need developers, often to build rather complex products that can’t have much downtime.\n\nAn area that’s bigger than ever are stablecoins - crypto assets pegged to (generally) the US dollar. The companies that offer these digital assets hold things like US treasuries to back them, so the company can earn revenue off of the interest while also ensuring that each digital dollar can be redeemed for a US dollar. As far as crypto things go, these are probably the most useful. People in countries with volatile currencies and poor banking systems can now receive, hold, send, and earn interest on US dollars with just a phone and an internet connection. They can send them anywhere in the world and be paid from anywhere in the world. And with the crap going on with Steam and itch.io having to block NSFW games because of pressure from credit card companies, I’d argue we actually could really use a digital dollar that’s as free flowing and censorship resistant as a real life physical dollar. And all of the software that runs this, as well as the apps people use to engage with it, require software devs.\n\nSo they’re either doing that, or trying to pump out another meme coin. It’s a pretty harsh dichotomy imo.",

I'll hit em back with a \"Aight, I'm tied up right now. Get started on debugging, I'll sync up with you later\". This then very explicitly creates the expectation that they need to take a stab at it before we sync up.\n\nI find more often than not, if I invent a little bit of space, people manage to figure out their issues by themselves, or at least get further along and try various things.\n\nInstant gratification, and spoonfeeding people answers, is what cultivates this kind of culture where at the first sign of any sort of issue you immediately go to Person X. And when you've cultivated a culture like that.... why wouldn't they? Why in the world would I read through logs, find the error, google that error, and spend time figuring out what's wrong and how to fix it? There's no need for me to do that if I can send a message to Person X and get an answer dropped in my lap.\n\nNot everyone is coachable that way, and that way isn't an instant-fix either. It takes a lot of time. Way more time than if I just kept doing it myself and sending them answers. But I have significantly improved my work life when I've landed on teams with people like this by slowly but surely coaching them to do things on their own without just abruptly telling them to pound sand.\n\nIt makes a great story for interviews when asked about mentorship as well.",

Its impossible to estimate \"potential and problem-solving ability\" from a single interview. Companies were not hiring for specific tech stacks before because the demand outweighed the supply.\n\n Hiring juniors is always a bet and now companies have the luxury of choosing among a vast pool of them. Of course they will rather choose the guy who aligns somewhat with their tech stack rather than the guy whose only coding experience is C++ console programs. Risk is still there but at least the first guy wont need 2-3 months to start being productive.",

No idea how, but he's managed to stay there for almost a decade. I don't even know what \"solutions engineer\" at google means, like there's people specifically trying to be good at that?  A good out for start up CTO is leading teams of people building new software, but that guy just turned left.\n\nSo something like that: get lucky early with a position you in no way earned, then flop into a corporate role where what you do is largely non-technical.",

Write down answers to the top 20-30 common ones (“tell me about yourself,” conflicts, mistakes, etc.).\n\n\\- For tech rounds, you don’t need to master everything. \\~100 leetcode mediums will carry you through most screens.

        "body": "I definitely resonate.\n\n\nI was 3 YOE and was laid off for 7 months. I finally got another swe job, but it took over 23+ different positions that led to at least technical rounds. The broadness of the prep really messed with me too.\n\n\nI think I still would of been boned if I had to start over but know what I learned from this layoff.\n\n\nI know what you mean, I thought I was out of the industry too. Out of the 23 attempts I only got 2 offers, and one was laughably bad compared to what I used to have. \n\n\nFor me specifically, even though every company was vastly different - I eventually kind of caught on there is overlap to an extent. Try to identify that, and leave the rest up to chance.\n\n\nThe reality is you have to get 90-100% on the \"exams\" and your competition has to screw up at our YOE ( tie breakers will usually go to most YOE or whoever stood out more). I had more than one job give me feedback that I actually did really good during the interviews, but my competition would have triple my experience and have a similar performance. I lost twice for a 6 round top 2 finalist.. right before I started my job I nailed round 3/4 for a 130k remote job then ghosted. It's just unfair lol. \n\n\nThe job I got my final competition was 20 yoe, 8 yoe, 15 yoe. I won at 3 yoe because I was the only one who solved the coding challenge, answered every question correct, AND they liked me / personality fit went well. It took 23 times to set up that scenario. That day was crazy. I had FIVE onsites in a week for 4 companies. I had TWO onsites the day I finally won one stupid job. Funny part is it was the one I thought I did bad on because their API challenge was absolutely stupid. They were like YOU HAVE 7 MINUTES TO MAKE A GET REQUEST API ON THIS CODEBASE HERES A LAPTOP.\n\n\nI was like ??. I survived being nearly interrogated by 3 men answering every question and had to completely switch gears. I've failed so many interviews due to stress and pressure. This particular time I think I was jaded that I had so many onsites in a week and had to go drive to my 2nd one literally right after this I took a breath and started. I talked out loud my thoughts, reiterating the REST pattern of controller implementation repostiory layers. I copied a different GET request in that file and started asking questions about the method and made the params or wrote comments what I wanted to do. I updated the same in the interface/model. I went into the repository layer and just copied how they're connecting to the DB and started making it. I ran out of time and couldn't make it run. Left going screw this place.\n\n\nTurns out I did the best and got further than the others... But the catch was it's a government job so it took 3 MONTHS to get a start date due to a lot of background checks.\n\n\n\nFor me personally, I wasn't getting leetcode that often towards the end. I did lose at least 3 positions because of failing the leetcode, but most of them didn't have it. I lost 2 positions to system design. What I did get almost consistently was this \"tech trivia\" interviews in my market. \n\n\nAsking very specific concepts or language questions and building off off it. I used free tier LLM's to give me 20-30 questions and go in depth prompting and trying to understand all the concepts. I would use the mic feature to simulate interview questions 1 by 1 and get feedback. I found that greatly helped me pass that round even if it wasn't perfect.\n\n\nTurns out some companies were getting questions from the same bank as me, and I would occasionally get some verbatim things I studied. Like what is async and go into detail. What is a Singleton. How would you debug an expensive SQL query. I also found by simulating those questions I had a higher chance of coming up with at least a passable sounding answer.\n\n\nI still suck at it - but to work on the little debugging / API / leetcode easiest / fill in the methods.. I went and did leetcode easy problems and put a timer for 10 minutes. My goal was to talk out loud and explain everything, and make a solution, test, run. In those simulations I could still feel pressure even then. Being at 8-9 minutes and I missed an edgecase and scrambling to fix it. \n\n\nI think that was the right path to work on the pressure part. If you're struggling specifically with crud api's I'd use LLM's to help you make a simple crud in your stack and study it. You could time urself to make a stupid crud or analyze a piece of code it generated / something open source ( I didn't end up doing this)\n\n\nSo in return, I basically was like my odds of passing are lower if I get Leetcode med or hard, system design, or something I haven't seen before. It's just too vast. You do want to work on it all but if I were to go again, id try to perfect a \"section\" of the interview during downtime, and cram like hell for whatever the current interview is gonna be.\n\n\nIt still sucks, I don't know the answer. I still can't believe I went thru all that. My actual job a month in isn't easy but it's kinda laughable how much lower expectations are vs the interview I had there. I'm getting a month to build a GET request, make test cases, consume it on the front end. Not 7 minutes... Lol\n\n\nI think if I had 6 more months to study I'd be closer to a top candidate but realistically I just need more resume experience for right now.",

The easiest way to do that is probably getting a programming job, observing the various roles around it, and making a switch.\n\nRE your self doubt, you’re smart enough to get a degree in CS, you seem motivated to get some credentials, to me it seems like you have a strong skill set. You made a game and open sourced it, that takes skill.\n\nIf you make a plan and present that to your parents, they will see it’s not your lack of initiative, it’s the fact that the rug (tech job market) has been pulled out so quickly from beneath you and there’s little to no support systems in place.\n\nAlso +1 to stop searching for remote gigs.

I wrote a ton of code, very little of it was very good, but it got me the experience I needed to know where the gaps in my knowledge were and spend time figuring those things out.\n\nMy second job was contracting at FAANG and if I could do it all over again (and could get in), I'd go to FAANG first and the startup second. A large corporate is going to have the people infrastructure to help you learn good, professional development practices. A startup is much more a roll of the dice. I'd only recommend a startup as a first job if you can be very confident that the team you'll be working with are experienced and willing to help you grow.",

In those roles, you'll learn how to build and operate scalable software that interacts with a large number of other teams. Start-ups will allow you to wear lots of different kinds of hats, solving more open-ended problems. It's also easier to work for a start-up on a personal level when you have no dependents or mortgage, since by-design start-ups should have a limited runway.\n\nThe advice I generally give is, it matters a lot more what you do with the opportunities that you're given.",

I felt like I could give him a task and with only a little guidance, he would figure it out on his own get it done and was really quick to pick up on things. I also didn't have to explain things to him multiple times. He would complete things quickly and with the enthusiasm of someone still fresh in the field.\n\nDespite me never wanting an intern in the first place I ended up pushing to hire him after the internship ended and after he finished out his last semester in school. He is now with us full time and whenever raise time comes around, I'm asking my boss what if anything I can do to help him get a promotion/raise- the answer is usually nothing, but I want to keep him because he has proven himself to be super valuable to the team and I know that earlier on in your career is when you can make moves to other companies for the biggest jumps in your career.\n\n  \nI guess to me what made the difference was that, he learned/improved quickly and was fairly independent. I didn't have to spell out each and every little step like I would to a chatgpt prompt. He had his own mind and could think through things instead of just follow my step by step instructions.",

You're establishing professional boundaries and making it clear that your working hours are 9-5, M-F. You'll be working 100% of your working hours.\n\nI don't know how cutthrough the consulting scene is, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but that's the advice I normally give to people suffering burnout. People always think in extremes. \"Put up with being miserable working 12 hour days\" vs \"Quit without anything lined up\".\n\nIn reality there's usually a less extreme option: \"Enforce your professional boundaries, and work 8 hour days, regardless of what's going on around you with the project and management\". And immediately start job searching with all that extra time.\n\nThe thing about that approach is even if that ruffles feathers, they usually don't fire you right away. They'll heckle you about your performance, they might PIP you, they'll desperately start looking for your replacement, maybe the client will drop you... but all that often takes months. Firing you outright is a much larger impact to the project than letting you work \"normal\" 8 hour days until they hire and train your replacement. It'd be a stupid management decision to react prematurely.\n\nSo in that time before they fire you... you're job searching *and* collecting a paycheck instead of draining your savings. And the best part of that approach is if they do end up firing you before you line something else up, you're *exactly* where you were about to put yourself voluntarily: Unemployed.\n\nThat said, at the end of the day quitting without something lined up isn't the end of the world. It's a calculated risk and an expense. If you decide that's worth it, go for it. If even after reducing your workday to 8 hours you're still feeling miserable, then that's likely not going to help, so quitting ASAP may be the best option for you.\n\nI'm surprised you lasted 3+ years of 12+ hour days... I would've be gone in month 1. WLB is my #1 priority. I'm a 9-5 employee. If I'm ever at a company where that's not sufficient, I take the above advice.",

You hinted at it with the personal finance remark, but you didn’t explicitly say that overtime at consulting firms are often compensated (and often at a 1.x multiplier of regular hourly rate). From the company’s perspective, a billable hour is a billable hour, but overtime hours are expensive, so it’d be perfectly reasonable to work with your leadership chain to cut overtime and hire more people instead. If relying on overtime is widespread, you can probably even rally support from coworkers by getting everyone to complain to leadership simultaneously.\n\nThe time tracking thing doesn’t need to involve micromanaging. All they care about is for time to be plausably accounted for, you don’t need to annotate every tiny minute. Nobody has time to audit everyone’s time sheets anyways, so you can usually get away with just blocking the whole day with your client’s project.",

What is complexity of accessing a hashmap, what is an interface, what is REST, what is ACID, what is an index and when do you use it, would you choose monolithic or microservices architecture for a startup?\n\n2nd round - live coding: TDD approach, language of my choice, editor of my choice, testing framework of my choice, AI disabled. Create a very simple bank account and a way to do a transaction between 2 accounts. Then make it work in a multithreaded environment.\n\n3rd round - still live coding but very pseudo-code stuff. Write very simple load balancer (no network stuff, just simple code no real integration), make it random, make it round Robin. Then few stuff about SQL, what is pessimistic locking, what is optimistic locking and how does it work, write SQL for it, show me how to use it. What is a transaction, a dead lock, etc..\n\n4th round - system design.. model a system that solves this simple X real problem found in our domain. Just a chat basically.\n\n\n1st round quickly filters out people who don't have basic knowledge\n\n2nd round verifies skills in OOP, TDD, multithreading (locks, dead lock, race conditions).\n\n3rd round again verifies skills in OOP (bit redundant tbh), but then goes into the DB and verifies that you actually know what is going on under the framework\n\n4th round verifies that you know more high-level architecture stuff.. message queues, redundancy, gateway/api/reverse-proxy, sharding... and that you can think bigger than just a few classes.\n\nI think these 4 rounds could be compressed in just 3 and be just as effective. Phone call was 15 minutes, the 3 rounds were a little more than 1 hour each. A total of roughly 5 hours that could be shortened to 3.5 or 4. I am very confident this process filters out 100% of the people who can't do the job. They verify all the skills needed to do the daily work that people apply every day. Perfect, imho. I don't get why it is so difficult for other companies to do the same.\n\nThis process is applied by a tech unicorn, so it definitely works at scale too..",

I was making a very good base comp. Enough that I had a small case of golden handcuffs. When speaking to a recruiter, I decided to give a number a little lower than I had been making. The market is rough, and I didn’t want to price myself out. I got an offer. If I hadn’t been laid off, I could have asked for more money. i usually try to avoid saying my number first, but I didn’t in this case. I may have cost myself money by doing that. When I told them my number, they said it was very doable. So, they likely had more budget. I explained my situation to them. I ended up getting more than I originally asked for, as we had some more decisions around comp, but not what I was making previously. \n\nI’m OK with it for now. I'm of the mindset jobs are temporary, but I’d love to find a long-term place. Of course I wish I was making the same or more. \n\nFWIW, I was honest during my interview process. Most people seemed reasonable, and they did offer more than my original stated number. But who knows what they said on their own? And they didn’t give a lot more than I asked for. ",

Agile practices help inform frontend devs what works best by having a tight iteration process with customers. Though I’ve never seen that practically work out well. The best is to have dedicated UX people, who work with product, customers, and engineers to come up with a solution. Then hand that off to engineering to actually build it.

Started writing software that helped my team, even though no one asked me and I wasn’t getting paid for it. Then the head IT guy left and me and another woman just started doing his job. Support, managing servers, etc. Then I started developing for our main software products.\n\nAfter that I was able to get a regular dev job at another company and did that for 3 years.\n\nA lot of it was luck and timing though. Took 7 years but I went from 25k/year to 140k/year, without a degree.\n\nNow I’m unemployed so I guess take my story with a grain of salt.",

If you genuinely feel like no one can do your job while you're away, that's a huge weakness for your team - no single dev should be load-bearing on a project. It also isn't great for your ability to be promoted if you're seen as the only person who can do your particular job. \n\nThis would be a GREAT thing to talk to your supervisor about in your next one-on-one. \"I've found that I feel guilty taking PTO because I worry that things will break down while I'm gone. What can we do to make our team more flexible, so that our ability to function well doesn't depend on me specifically sitting in that chair?\" \n\nMaybe have some suggestions - more comprehensive documentation, perhaps some cross-training with others on your team so have more of a grasp of each other's particular roles?

Employers have so much to choose from, they'll easily find someone who has experience with the stack they use and will be productive on day 1.\n\nGiven that you are a recent grad, you have no previous job but you have your coursework, your projects, your interests. Try to find jobs that align with those.\n\nIf you are going to keep contributing to OSS or building projects of your own, try to stick to a theme or domain.

Add a career summary at the top of the resume that rounds out all of your experience and the skills that you picked up. I would then consolidate the skills section to just the important skills that are referenced in a job listing. \n2. Leave out the career gap. They can infer that from gaps between one job to another. \n3. I don't think the awards section is relevant personally. If you want to keep it for sentimental reasons then I'd suggest having it last. \n4. You have far too much job experience to still warrant having projects in my opinion. I'd remove them. \n5. Add more information on the jobs that you had. Simply listing the jobs is not enough. Explicitly mention the technologies and tools used and what projects you did. \n6. Languages is not necessary in my opinion. Most applications ask for this before you input your resume. But it could be different for you, If so, then it can be kept. But I'd make it a single line.\n\nAs for the job application, I prefer Indeed to LinkedIn personally and got my last job through there. Also I'd suggest applying on the company website whenever possible, companies have separate pipelines for applications and pay attention to the ones that come in through their website. I'd also say that don't just fire off the same resume hundreds of times. Tweak it slightly for every single job and ensure that it meets all of the minimum and most of the preferred qualifications. \n\nAlso, I somewhat disagree with what another user on here said, the goal of your resume nowadays is to pass the ATS, not talk to a live person. Your resume should obviously be in human readable format but it should be jam packed with enough key words from the job description to get a high enough match and pass the ATS. After passing the ATS, you just have to convince a real human to hire you... which is far easier than some automated check that fails damn near everyone.",

The compliments were crazy like, Ah you're angel, you're so smart, you're so handsome, etc etc. It was a LOT from different people and honestly I felt like a celebrity there.\n\nJapan has a heiarchy of age and mentorship. Japanese call this like a Senpai-Kouhai relationship.  Basically they view their job as an older person or mentor to guide you, treat you, and sort of mold you as best they can. It can be weird from a westerner perspective because work time is work time and there's no \"relationship\" besides training you. \n\nI personally wouldn't be alarmed by this behavior but I'd still maintain distance. A lot of these type of people are  fascinated with having foreign friends. it's largely a selfish relationship for them. I often felt like a token foreigner friend and many girls wanted to date me just for being a foreigner. I sense this guy is the same.

But they can be used as protection by the company to demonstrate that there were performance issues with the employee. The goal being to convince others that the company didn't wrongfully terminate for illegal reasons. In case the terminated employee decides to pursue legal action against the company.\n\nBy placing someone on a PIP they create a paper trail (no matter how flimsy it is) that the person wasn't performing their job well. I suspect it's also to cause doubt in the employee's mind about the likelyhood of prevailing in court. By having a formalized process where they told you, that you weren't performing maybe that can convince you to just accept it and quietly go away.\n\nAs for your second question there's only a few paths. One, do whatever they ask to get off the PIP if possible. Though to be honest it sounds like you wouldn't be happy in your current role (QA Automation/ not dev and poorly maintained code base). Two, resign. Three collect pay checks while looking for the next job until they fire you. Option three will yield unemployment.\n\nEach one has tradeoffs. E.g. if you get fired while on the PIP you probably won't want to use your boss at the job as a reference. If you have a long employment history and can use someone else as a reference that may not be a problem.\n\nI can't comment on disability so I'll leave that to someone else to comment on.\n\nI'm sorry you are going through this.

Which again, can be literally \"you have to pay me the remainder of my contract\".\n\nSo yeah, next time don't ask if they can guarantee employment (they can't), but ask what their standard severance package is at your level, and then tell them that since this job would require relocation to a very expensive city (from a very expensive city), that you'd like to negotiate a more substantial severance package to ensure that you're financially able to relocate back to your city of choice.\n\nMind you, depending on your level, they might still say no - especially large companies tend to have pretty inflexibly policies for this type of stuff for rank and file employees.

In addition to talking about what was involved in coding the dashboard, you should talk about things like: why your company wanted this dashboard built, how you worked with the design team to build your dashboard to their design spec, how you wrote unit/functional/e2e tests and UATed your dashboard prior to deploy, how you used feature flagging and log monitoring to ensure a successful deploy, and what business goals were accomplished after you successfully deployed your dashboard. Even if these things feel like standard process and not that interesting to you, talking about them shows that you understand what goes into the things you build at a higher level beyond just the code you are asked to write.",

Whatever feels empty inside will resolve itself if you just stop the chase. You already have everything you need you're just so blindsided by the thrill of doing that you can't see any of it. So just stop, not forever, just for a while. Take at least 6 months off, take it easy, eat better food, sleep for a while, do other things, answers will surface when the storm is cleared. \n\nTrust me, friend I've never met.

I could go into the issues with advice subreddits in particular.... but I don't need to to make my point. Dont make major life decisions off anecdotes you read on *any* subreddits, doesn't matter which one.\n\nIf you want to pursue CS, pursue CS.\n\nThere are *plenty* of new grads that are lining up jobs just fine. You know where they are? Not on a CS Careers Questions subreddit. They're not here talking about how easy their job search was. They're enjoying their life.\n\nThe unemployment rate for new CS grads is 6.1%. While that number is high, and puts us in the top 10 for highest unemployment rates by degree.... That still means 93.9% of CS new grads are employed.\n\nThe underemployment rate for new CS grads is 16.5%. This is the number of people employed in a job that utilizes their college degree. So it filters out the people that gave up and went to McDonalds. *This* number for us puts us in the *bottom 5* for all degrees regarding underemployment. We're doing pretty damn well. Or I should say 83.5% of us are doing pretty damn well.\n\nThe 6.1%? The 16.5%? Those are the people that make up the majority of an advice subreddit's demographic, *because they need advice.* The 93.9% and 83.5% aren't normally posting here. And when they do (hello, it's me), they often get downvoted because it hurts to hear that you're in the bottom 16.5% of the industry. I understand it hurts to hear that, that percentage translates into a lot of people, but it's something people need to hear.\n\nAnd people not in the industry at all, like you, shouldn't be blinded by those peoples experiences.",

And apply to roles where there is a coding round so those skills can shine through\n\n>I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber instead\n\nYes, that's called opportunity cost. It's same the logic with going to college instead of working somewhere right out of high school\n\n>So, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.\n\nThe way people on this sub bemoan coding interviews ad nauseam, I thought this was a desirable format for interviews\n\nI don't think you're being a negativity spreader.

You already have 2 years at big tech, that's actually gold for ML roles if you spin it right.\n\nInstead of going straight to a traditional masters, why not look into something more targeted? At Metana we've seen people make this exact transition without dropping 50k on a degree. The trick is building a portfolio that shows you can actually do the work, not just pass exams.\n\nYour research internship is clutch, lean into that hard. Start contributing to open source ML projects, build some models that solve real problems, document everything on github. Companies care way more about seeing you ship ML products than seeing another piece of paper.\n\nAlso lol at \"computational biology being a one off\", that lab probably just follows the funding, which is how academia works. Don't take it personally.\n\nIf you're dead set on the masters route, consider part time programs or even bootcamp-style intensive programs that focus specifically on ML/data science. Way cheaper, way more practical, and you keep earning while learning.\n\nBut honestly? With your big tech experience, I'd bet you could transition internally at a different company before needing any additional schooling. The key is positioning your SWE skills as \"I understand production systems AND ML theory\" rather than \"I'm just another SWE who wants to do ML.\"\n\nThe market sucks right now but ML roles are still out there, especially if you can show you understand both sides of the equation.",

        "body": "Well.. here's the problem.\n\nYou know how relevant Leetcode question is to your daily job?\n\nJust extend that to how relevant System design question is to your daily job as well.\n\n>So what exactly was the point of this round? Was it to see how well I would design a system or was it on whether I read a book?\n\nTo see if you can regurgitate what you memorized on Youtube. And be a good talker. Be able to convince the other side you know everything from ground up and you are a rock star. And sound super organized.\n\n>I've never considered idempotency or what a hash ring is or what golden invariants are. I've never thought about CAP theorem, just that available and consistent is good. Requirements get passed to us by product managers, we never make them from a 5 minute conversation with the BA or stakeholder.\n\nThis is what my friends (senior engineers) at Google told me.\n\n\"We just use Spanner for everything. For all practical purposes, Spanner is highly available, highly consistent (basically instant so the 'eventual' part is just theory for practical purposes), and infinite scale.\"\n\nSo ya... now, CAP theorem states that in a real world, we have to choose Availability or Consistency as first priority. And that is true. But generally the idea is if you are dealing with money especially in banks, then choose Consistency. Otherwise, basically all the time Availability is fine.\n\nIn the real world? Unless you work at Amazon/Google scale, you are going to use postgres/mysql anyways. And even at those big tech firms sql databases are used in many teams.\n\nAs for what kind of databases I worked over so far: postgresql, mysql, mongodb, cassandra\n\nAlmost all companies using MongoDB are using MongoDB for no reason than \"it's webscale\" meme. It's tech debt. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs)\n\nUse case for Cassandra/DynamoDb is niche overall.\n\nScale? Dude, sql databases have run the world forever. Credit cards before the days of DynamoDB worked everywhere around the world. Everyone was swiping left and right. Big banks hold records of swipes, withdrawals, deposits, etc globally. Those dumb Youtube videos during covid by these juniors trying to gain views about high writes == nosql (kind of true but whatever)? sql databases can when writes are properly batched in theory go over a million insert per second though in reality, let's say 10k insert per second. 10k insert per second is 10\\^5 \\* 10\\^5 sec a day = 10\\^10 inserts a day aka 10 billion rows a day.\n\nSchemaless? Unless you are dealing with e-commerce, fraud, machine learning, etc., you can shove in your metadata to JSONB on postgresql.\n\nACID vs BASE? DynamoDB supports ACID as well. You can have sql databases have BASE like properties. Especially mysql in which you can change engine.\n\nBiggest differences are really nosql databases tend to be LSM tree oriented while sql databases tend to be B tree oriented. But DynamoDB on its sort key is B tree oriented as well.\n\nSharding? SQL can have auto sharding. Though it is true in practice (this part I agree since I have not used auto sharding in my jobs) you do have to worry about sharding on SQL. But like what? A few days a year or two for the team once everythings set up? Ya, nonissue.\n\nIt's all a clownfest at this point with each databases trying to emulate parts of the other database as well.\n\n**System Design Interview crap made more sense back when hardware was limited. Nowadays, we can have Redis instance with over half a terrabyte RAM. Many times, we can just chug the entire useful parts of database to the whole Redis.**\n\n  \nNow caching? Lol wait till you learn DynamoDB handles that for you if you are willing to pay extra. DynamoDB comes with caching by a click of a button so you don't need to handle a separate Redis instance. Just pay more money to AWS. All these \"scale problems\" you see in system design interviews are basically being all solved by Cloud providers. Cloud providers are not stupid. AWS needs to make more money. Why not just add more features to address all the known system design workarounds of the past?",

A properly run mature firm should have had infra team do all the tooling so product side engineering can just ship.\n\nSystem Design Interview is just another theatre like Leetcode Interview. Don't overthink. Companies need some way to separate levels and filter candidates at the onsite.\n\nYou think most engineers in tech ever built Amazon e-commerce site ground up? Nope. Maybe a few handful in the country? But you get that interview. Where do you think many interviewers get the question and answer from? Whatever they saw/memorized with their own experiences added on the Internet/workplace.\n\nIf you actually do quick 'back of the envelope' calculation to many system design interviews, you will realize \"I can do this with 1 server\" (you should STILL have replica because servers always crash).

System Design interview prep alone can take months. Similar idea with Leetcode and so forth. And realistically years because you do this in sprints over your career as you level up.\n\nBasically say your job only involves taking sums (adding basic items). If you test the candidate all sorts of ideas like taking sum/division/multiplication/difference of real numbers (negative numbers, decimals, integers, irrational numbers, etc), imaginary numbers, symbols, etc. then you can feel somewhat assured the person can probably add basic numbers reliably. Is that correlation perfect? Nope. But I would find it hard pressed to find someone who can do a complex operation involving multiple paranthesis, imaginary number, negative number, multiplication, addition all nested together to struggle with basic additions consistently. It also helps you filter as much candidates as you want and make you feel \"I got the best candidate out of thousands\".",

As a Canadian, you qualify for a TN visa which would allow you to work in the U.S.\n\nYou will most likely not be able to do what you’re suggesting, that is only go into the office only 1 day a week. To keep your work permit active, you must be U.S resident for tax purposes. And to do this, you’ll have to meet the substantial presence test which requires you to physically be in the US for more than half the year. Unfortunately, there is no provision that will grant you work authorization in the US while allowing you to live abroad. The only way this would’ve been possible is if you also held US citizenship.

        "body": "I personally think that of the things which AI will impact the most in this space,  its design. I am a fullstack engineer and the biggest trouble I had with personal projects is the designs of my pages. I now can get AI to come up with a theme, a design, a layout, an admin dashboard, a home page and everything for me to use as a basis to build on and bounce my own ideas off.\n\nAlthough I think great design is unbelievably valuable, I think good design is fairly self evident. I mean, I can tell you if a site is well designed  - so can my mother. I dont think its difficult for AI to grasp this concept and produce designs for you. Almost all sites have at the very least the same layout; search bar at the top, nav bar top right/left and so on. Beyond this and the small design changes between different sites, I cant see design needing to be done in the way it is now. My team at work no longer needs the amount of designers we have - we got AI to design us a new view based on our existing views and it looked great.\n\nThe only exception to this (as always there are exceptions) will be exceptional designers in my option. Those designers who come up with new, unique almost game changing designs followed by many. AI wont be able to do this as easily, because AI needs a basis to train on. For example, in the late 2010's we got the gradient design you see on Stripe, with the scrolling animations as you scroll down. I think this design was game changing within the game of design, and so many sites followed this (I dont even know if Stripe were first tbh).\n\nI feel like if youre that good, original and can constantly change/push the bar, you'll be fine. However I would bet that most design teams will be shrinking in the coming 5-10 years.",

        "body": "First thing I’d suggest is to pause the scattershot learning for a moment. It’s easy to feel like you need to chase every cert or language, but that often leads to burnout without real progress. Instead, reflect on what you enjoyed most from your tech role. Was it the problem solving side of coding, or the precision and detail that comes with testing? If testing was your comfort zone, roles in QA automation or SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) could be a natural pivot. These roles often let you leverage your coding skills while staying close to quality focused work.\n\nIf you’re craving something new, IT certifications can definitely open doors but you’ll want to be strategic. For example, if you go the cloud route, AWS Solutions Architect Associate or Azure Fundamentals → Administrator can get you noticed quickly. If you lean toward cybersecurity, CompTIA Security+ is a great starting point and pairs well with your testing mindset. The key is to pick one lane, commit, and build a portfolio around it. Whether that’s small projects on GitHub, automation scripts, or even freelance gigs on platforms like Upwork. Freelancing can also be a good bridge though it won’t always be glamorous, but it’s real world experience that helps fill the gap on your resume.\n\nIf you can structure the next 6–12 months around one clear goal say, “transition into cloud roles” or “move into automation testing” you’ll find it much easier to cut through the fog. And if you’d like more step by step advice, practical roadmaps, and career tips, [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) shares a lot of that. It might help you stay focused and feel less alone while you rebuild.",
