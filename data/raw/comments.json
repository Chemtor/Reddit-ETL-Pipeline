What helped me was changing my practice approach - instead of trying to solve a ton of problems, I focused on deeply understanding a smaller set of core patterns and writing them from scratch repeatedly until the syntax became muscle memory. I also started narrating my thought process out loud during practice to get comfortable talking through my approach. Have you tried platforms like interview query? They have some DE-specific practice problems that are more relevant than generic LeetCode, plus they offer peer mock interviews where you can practice the communication part. Sometimes just getting comfortable with the interview format is half the battle. Don't beat yourself up - these interviews are rarely representative of the actual job!",

Basically get really good at linked lists, dictionaries/hash maps, two-pointer, array problems. I haven't seen any other data structures being asked (maybe some chance dynamic programming). A good interviewer will work with you if you get stuck when solving these problems, and on top of that they should understand that you're under pressure and might not be operating at your best. The more rejections you get, the more you learn.

I also think hiring teams, for various reasons, are sometimes not equipped to relate the core concepts of data engineering over their own, so instead they feel more comfortable talking to candidates who have experience in their specific toolset.\n\nThe skill I'm trying to build right now in my own interviews is assessing, understanding, and directly addressing any concerns a prospective employer might have about my skillset and my suitability to the job. You have to learn to speak the language they speak.\n\nIn the future I'd try to give more options during interviews to the interviewers on how they want to proceed. If they want to see a project you are familiar with, pull up your notes. If they want to focus on your experience with their tools, follow up with clarifying questions about your scope and then propose a solution -- or even just relate how your experience applies to solving that particular problem.\n\nHope that helps some.

QA should be similar to PROD.\n\n2. Have automated load tests to know breaking points.\n\n3. Good observability similar to services with proactive monitoring.\n\n4. Good data contracts (you already have them).\n\n5. Repeatable fixed size workloads through out the pipeline (you can have a generic splitter component that you can hook to any of your stages to ensure that any component always gets regulated input).\n\nHonestly the problems that you highlighted light up my eyes, DEs are excited to solve these problems :)\n\nAll the best!",

No.\n\nThe original problem was two fold: 1) reporting was being done against transactional databases which slowed those transactional systems down noticeably and 2) it’s wasn’t spreadsheets it was extracts. Systems were very siloed in the pre-ERP days and all of these systems needed to be connected with data extracts - often time for reporting purposes. The extracts all were done at different times causing massive data quality issues. Data warehousing was invented to deal with these two issues. Spreadsheet technology was just ramping up at this time, and would soon become yet another challenge for data professions, but it was not the original challenge. Remember, in the pre-1980s the average office worker didn’t have a computer.\n\nEdit: the star schema was added early on to help BI queries execute more efficiently on database platforms at the time (and be more understandable to analysts as PCs became more widespread in the workforce). Star schemas are still very important today, but as our computing resources have grown the performance benefits are not quite as apparent.",

You can do it via a technical path, a management path, etc. Almost all ways of moving up will move you farther and farther away from day to day coding. In order to be considered for these type of positions, you need to start developing skills for them. Most of them don't come naturally and are often hard for people who are really into the weeds.\n\nWant to move up to an architect? Architects only code enough to prove out concepts and ideas that will work on a design. When I have had people come up to me to ask about becoming an architect, the first question to them is, \"Are you ready to give up coding?\" Not because they won't have to, but I am looking to see if their head is in a space for the next steps. Architects have one foot in the business world and one in the tech world. The two worlds are very, very different.\n\nHone your people skills. No matter how you move up, you will need them and they can always be better. You will have to start listening for business requirements (both stated and implied) and figure out not only what they are saying but the right patterns to pass down for the coders to implement. It is hard because the sirens in the weeds will always be there calling you back. You have to fight them. Every time you think, \"I could do this faster myself\" you need to STOP. \n\nNext level up is changing your tools. Your tools are no longer software on hardware but the software inside people's head. You need to learn how to communicate what you want done to other people. Unlike the hardware you are used to, sometimes you may need to do it multiple times to get what you want. You also have to make your people (tools) better. I think that is an obligations more senior people have to the newer ones. The trick is how to do it without being a dick.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.",

Yes, DW can do this and be very performant.\n\nMostly, a Lakehouse is nothing new under the sun. It is just a name for gathering multiple types of data in one place.

Many services, cloud providers, and other stacks will work natively with open formats in a DL/DLH. So you can always leverage or pivot different technologies. And it’s a lot more forgiving in an architecture choice. You can mix and match lots of different stacks on the same data if desired.

Like SQL, Oracle, Snowflake, etc. Assuming you are not leveraging newer features to store in open formats. That isn’t meant to discourage or trash DWH it’s just you need to understand the goals of the platform, requirements, and how users consume and develop to see what would be best. For example, the above about DL/DLH are objectively better at transformation engines and scalability. However, if your users eat and breathe TSQL, and refuse to learn anything else.

So if you build a datetime dimension at the second granularity, either you'd have to arbitrarily assign those dates to the first second of the day, which is misleading and wrong, or create a different dim_date dimension anyway.\n\nFor a similar reason it's sometimes useful to have a separate dim_month table with year-month as the key (can be created as just a view on the dim_date table.) If you get data that is only available at the month resolution, you can either assign it to a specific day (not ideal) or use the month dimension to faithfully represent the data as it was recorded in the source.\n\nRetain the timestamps as measures, use two dimensions as you have.",

There are certain ratios you are looking for to help those joins perform. For example, your fact might be billions of rows but dim date will always be thousands. Joining time dimension with date dimension to create a datetime dimension (at the… millisecond? grain) is really against the idea here. Similar to a degenerate dimension like a source system unique key - does it go on the fact or a separate dim? Well, if it’s a unique value per fact row (ie: it’s 1:1 with fact) then it should go on the fact, not in a dim. \n\nIf you take some time and revisit dimensional modeling points like these you will see that you are correct, and the idea here is certain ratios. Date and time are separate to keep those dim tables small.",

The small number of engineers could not keep up with the volume and variety of requests so the analytics team bought a BI solution that allowed them to maintain their own models (Looker in this case). Based on your definition this was a ‘Shift Right’. \n\nThe analytics team operated for years without dedicated people to ensure their environment was well organized or resilient to new business processes that require the logic that was locked in that transformation layer.\n\nWhen I took over that position we started to migrate logic out of Looker and into DBT, a process we are still working through today. \n\nThe pilot project here was to deal with a deviation of a legacy data model in our data engineering environment by cleaning up and replacing it with all the goodies our analytics team extended and prepared in Looker for years. Once the legacy model was replaced we also made sure everything was set to refer to the new models.\n\nWe are not moving away from having analysts model in Looker/LookML, though we have also set them up with DBT Cloud. Instead we are treating that workflow more like prototyping. Once our analysts have iteratively refined those models and they are stable we find the best way to ‘Shift them to the Left’. Sometimes these prototypes are abandoned by the business or analysts. This is fine, we didn’t put any additional engineering resources into it.",

In practice autoloader just simplifies the parallelization when it comes to ingesting many small files daily and provides a checkpointing system for you to maintain progress. You can achieve all of that with your own system especially if it is encrypted because as you noticed, you can't use autoloader out of the box for that. The other question is how simple (read: manageable) it is, because once you have any issues with your lambda system built on autoloader you might have to reprocess everything.",

By appending everything you receive without reference to what is already in the table at the time you insert it you can have multiple writers all writing at the same time without conflict. If you start doing merge operations or `where not exists` on the target table then you can start getting write conflicts.\n\nHaving lots of small files is an issue when you're reading the data back, as it takes longer and longer to make all the individual API calls to grab each object. That can be handled by periodically doing a compaction on the files. A compaction can be run at the same time as blind inserts -- they don't conflict with each other.\n\nBut this is all fine on a scale up to writing every second or so. If you're *constantly* making tiny writes and inserts then you're crossing more into streaming territory. If you can receive your data through a stream (or queue) then you can buffer up writes for a while then bulk write them to iceberg. AWS Data Firehose and Azure Event Hubs can do some of this for you automatically - each has a capability to automatically write all streamed data out to data files every time a buffer threshold is reached (up to ~15 minutes / ~300MB, whichever is first). If you don't need ultra-low latency queries, then these can work, and generally if you're working off of some open table format your queries have a certain minimum latency anyway.\n\n---\n\nThe post you read may be talking about something like [Databricks autoloader](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ingestion/cloud-object-storage/auto-loader/). If anything else automatically does this for you it will have to be part of the execution & orchestration engine that you're working on. It *needs* some kind of eventing system and metadata-storing db to track everything. Iceberg is just a table format spec, not an ingestion engine of its own.\n\nWhatever it is it will basically be catching blob triggers and writing their data into a managed low latency db, then periodically grabbing any unprocessed files and batch loading them. It isn't super difficult to roll your own, but there's a few components and you'll have to reason things out yourself around managing the state for un/processed file metadata.",

We worked with a Faroese company information platform that pushed all their raw events into Flowcore — and even though the events were pretty basic (like CRUD changes and updates), we were able to layer meaning on top during replay to build dedicated AI-optimized models. The result was that they now have an AI chat interface where users can ask super abstract questions, like *“Which municipality had the most new companies in 2024?”* or *“Tell me about this specific person and all the companies they’re involved in”* — and it just works. What’s cool is they didn’t need to rebuild their system, they just replayed their existing events into a new shape, and suddenly the AI could reason over the data properly.",

Knowing the warts and how to work around them is itself a useful skill.\n2) When onboarding new DEs, far more of them will be accustomed to Airflow, which makes onboarding simpler.\n3) The ecosystem around Airflow is more mature. Nearly every tool that can be orchestrated has an integration with Airflow, usually as a first-class citizen.\n4) If you have the budget there are services like Astronomer that make setting up and maintaining Airflow much simpler.

The system doesn’t need to be real-time either – near real-time is absolutely fine. On average, I might just visualize a handful of values per day unless there’s an issue.\n\nWhat is important, though, is that I’ll download each day’s data as a file for later analysis. I plan to convert the raw data into an MDF format with a daily job and then process it elsewhere. So everything I store, I will at least once download.\n\nThat said, it’s really hard to estimate how often I’ll query or access the data, since that heavily depends on whether problems occur or not.",

Scaling into AI Governance\n\n* **ML & Model Metadata**\n   * While it covers traditional data catalog scenarios, OpenMetadata also integrates with ML orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow, Dagster) and can capture pipeline-level lineage for your model training datasets.\n   * Over time, you can expand to track model versions, data drift, or compliance rules for AI usage.\n* **Collate’s Governance Automations**\n   * Collate offers “no-code” workflows (and a CLI for deeper customization) to automate governance tasks—like auto-classifying PII, setting data retention policies, or notifying owners when data drifts.\n   * [This blog post](https://blog.getcollate.io/data-governance-that-runs-itself-with-collate-metadata-automations) shows how Collate can run daily governance checks with minimal human intervention.\n\n# 5. Integrations with Snowflake, dbt, Looker, etc.\n\n* **Broad Connector Coverage**\n   * [Snowflake](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/database/snowflake), dbt, Looker, Tableau, Power BI, Databricks…the list goes on. You get schema ingestion, usage metrics, lineage, and more.\n* **Unified Metadata Platform for All Data**\n   * Whether you’re storing data in S3 or analyzing it in Looker, your team can see everything in one place: lineage maps, usage patterns, and ownership info.\n\n#",

        "body": "We like how the OpenMetadata project started as unified platform for discovery, observability, and governance with the idea of bringing different data teams together. But we were skeptical if they can pull it off. However, the project has moved at a very high velocity, incorporating community feedback. Few things we like:  \n1. Last time I saw OM had 100+ releases in 3 years. Datahub over maybe over 8 years has 95 releases.  \n2. Datahub has just started adding native data quality support. Seems like it is not available in OSS. Datahub is behind OM in many important features.  \n3. We like collaboration features in OpenMetadata (activity feed, alerts, conversations, etc.) that are preserved/tracked around data. We were losing these in Slack threads.  \n4. Architectural simplicity. Not too many moving parts and no core dependency on Kafka. We could easily operationalize in our small infra team.  \n5. Community support on Slack is amazing. Some issues we reported were fixed immediately in the next release (our previous paid solution did not provide such support after paying a lot of money).  \n6. They have a sandbox that runs the latest release that we can play around with and give feedback.  \n7. APIs are very comprehensive and intuitive. We have built many custom workflows specific to our company for governance and data quality.\n\nThey also have an offering built around OpenMetadata with additional features. But for us, the OSS features are good enough.",

Switching from an In-House or Legacy Catalog\n\n* **Consolidate Your Metadata**\n   * Instead of patching together multiple governance and data-quality tools, you can unify them under one platform.\n   * A single source of truth means fewer discrepancies, plus easier auditing.\n* **Easy Migration**\n   * The strong REST APIs and schema-based approach make it simpler to bulk-import existing metadata or export it if you ever need to.\n\n# Extra Note: Customizable E2E UI for Technical & Business Users\n\n* **Flexible UI & Role-Based Access**\n   * Both OpenMetadata and Collate support role-based views and custom attributes so you can tailor the interface for data engineers, analysts, or business stakeholders.\n   * You can embed business glossaries, domain-specific tags, or custom dashboards—ensuring non-technical users find the data context they need without wading through engineering-heavy details.\n\n**Collate’s Enterprise features**\n\nCollate adds several enterprise features on top of OpenMetadata. You can check full comparison here [https://www.getcollate.io/comparison](https://www.getcollate.io/comparison)\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\n**OpenMetadata** alone is robust  for most production needs—covering catalog, lineage, governance, and data quality in a lightweight architecture. If you want enterprise-grade features or a fully-managed service (so you don’t have to babysit infrastructure), [**Collate**](https://www.getcollate.io/comparison) offers a deeper feature set and is built directly on top of the OpenMetadata core.\n\nEither path gives you a modern, API-driven approach to metadata management and governance, ready to scale with your fintech or ML ambitions.

Then capturing this to a data warehouse for centralised analytics workflows. For example, snowflake can read S3 data using the 'external tables' quite well - this is good where files are just added over time and records don't change.\n\n\nI used to be a mass spectrometry researcher so I understand what you mean about the closed source export methods. Be careful about vendors like Thermo trying to sell their cloud solutions, unless you like paying for a suite of contractors and a funky proprietary cloud solution.\n\n\nThe interpretation can be left to the scientists. If it's clean and in one place, it shouldn't be an issue for them. Though it's worth testing at least one pipeline with them to ensure it's fit for purpose. And honestly even just getting data into S3 might work for some, as many researchers I knew (myself included) were comfortable using python to analyse cloud data - otherwise probably R.",

Periodically, a scraper searched the networked folder for new data and loaded it to the warehouse. An ETL cleaned the data and formatted it so that it could be displayed on the calibration status dashboard. The cleaned data were also available on the self service abalytics platform. \n\n\nLab data is challenging because it's ofte less structured than data from an API or service backend. At all times you need to make sure the extraction and transformation process is representative of something physical that really happened. It involves a lot of conversation and buy in from stakeholders and lab management to do this right. So, I'd recommend to start there. ",

I'd recommend having a folder structure by instrument name, date, and split it either by user, by the test, or by both e.g:\n\n`FTIR/01Jan2025/Test/file.csv` or `FTIR/01Jan2025/User/file.csv` or `FTIR/01Jan2025/Test/User/file.csv`\n\n(I label dates like this because for my sins I have spent time working in QC where I sent samples around the world and we needed a universal date format everybody understood)\n\nThis will be on your local network so all computers connected to instruments can dump the data there and then you have a single location to point your data processing tools to.\n\n> The output files are typically in a binary format. Instrument vendors usually don’t provide parsers or APIs, as they want to protect their proprietary technologies.\n\nThis is a huge ballache.  You'll want to put all unprocessed binary files into their own folder and convert them into a digestible format if absolutely required.  Bear in mind each file might need it's own process, hence, the ballache.\n\n> In most cases, the instruments come with dedicated software for data analysis, and the results can be exported as XLSX or CSV files. However, since each user may perform the analysis differently and customize how the reports are exported, the output formats can vary significantly—even for the same instrument.\n\nOne potential way is to have a standardised output.  I get this massively depends on the instrument and testing although if that's possible, it would make everybody's lives easier.\n\n> Even if we can parse the raw or exported files, interpreting the data often requires domain knowledge from the lab scientists.\n\nWhich makes complete sense.  What happens to the data after you parse it? i.e. do you email it to specific users, do you have it printed out? etc\n\n> Given these constraints, is it even possible to build a reliable ELT/ETL pipeline?\n\nI'd say yes, although there's a high level of complexity.",

In my previous life I was a molecular biologist and I quickly found out that essentially all of the devices I used “proprietary file formats” were literally just XML. Obviously I don’t know your equipment, and I might be saying something very obvious to you, but reiterating that you should actually check this, don’t assume proprietary format = binary. If they are readable, you can either write custom parsers, or find some online.\n\nThat being said. It is quite ambitious to try and reimplement a whole bunch of specialised lab equipment software at scale. I think that a lower (but probably achievable) aim to set yourself would be to just try and centralise data storage, put in place good metadata, versioning, etc. I reckon the “T” in ETL/ELT will prove difficult.",

        "body": "You are working under a fallacy here. The idea that hosting sensitive workloads on-premises is more secure than in the cloud is not accurate. It's an emotional holdover. People like to think if they can touch their server or hug their storage, it is better than hosting it in the cloud. It just isn't true. There are more controls in the cloud for access control and security than I have seen in anyone's data center and I have seen many Fortune 100 companies data centers. Starting from physical security to data in flight & at rest to designs clouds are almost always able to be more secure. The issues come with knowledge and implementation. This is the same no matter the location.\n\nI have secured data in cloud providers where not even the CSP can get to them and they remain very performant. It just takes a bit of creativity on your part.\n\nFrom an architectural standpoint, splitting your analytic workload across a wide area network is a bad idea. The physics just work against you. The bandwidth between on-premises and cloud is never enough. Consider bouncing a 1TB table at one location against a 1TB table at a different location. Even with tricks like  predicate pushdown and column reduction, you will still end up moving quite a bit of data to compare/join the tables. That has to happen over a WAN instead of an internal bus. It just doesn't fly. Like I said, the physics doesn't lie and can't be bargained with.\n\n<rant>The term \"Lakehouse\" is a Databricks marketing term and not a technical one. I try not to feed marketing monsters. The concepts behind their particular flavor of DW have been around for a long time. Don't get confused by a new coat of paint.</rant>",

The pricing is much more predictable ($0.50/GB + flat-rate connector pricing) which can be significantly more cost-effective at scale, especially compared to Fivetran’s new MAR-per-connector (what a mouthful) model or Hevo’s event-based model, which can become unpredictable if your upstream volumes spike as well.\n\n[Here’s](https://estuary.dev/etl-tools/estuary-vs-hevo/) a direct comparison we found helpful when evaluating.\n\nHappy to chat more if helpful!

Companies implementing similar ETL patterns with tools like Windsor.ai often use parameter validation to avoid runtime errors when expected configuration values are missing from metadata stores.\n\nAnother optimization would be to consider implementing a single copy approach with dynamic sink paths instead of separate copy activities, which would reduce pipeline complexity and potential points of failure while maintaining your conditional deletion logic.",

Many companies do not want to invest the time or money in it not because there is no value but because there is no value but because they do not want impact to their bottom line ... which for some bites them in the end when a data breach happens.\n\nIs it a safe role right now? No... unless you are a service provider you does this and helps companies get started or mature their DG in a cost effective manner. But for many it is a necessary evil and those in such roles are not treated well or not prepared properly or not even qualified (many DG folks are typically business users with no real understanding of the regulations they are supposed to police). \n\nWill it be safe in the near future?

        "body": "Some hard-won advice on this topic:  \n\n1. Have a good working relationship with your manager. Build trust. This will ensure they _actually hear you_ when you ask to take on opportunities to push yourself. Pushing yourself without this trust can cause your manager to view you as self-sabotaging (causing delays, \"biting off more than they can chew\"), which makes everything harder.  \n2. Identify the developers on your team (or close to your team, this includes DevOps, architects, and even senior QA) who actually care about the quality of their work. Like someone else in this thread said, many people work in software simply because of the pay. Sometimes the \"this is just a job\" people are very talented engineers, but it's not as likely. When you find the people who really care, pair with them on your work, go to them with questions, etc.  \n3. Don't waste time, but ask questions when you can. In particular, if someone more experienced than you has work you can look at (e.g. in a pull request), and their implementation doesn't line up with how you would have approached the problem, ask them (politely/when it's convenient) to help you understand why they chose their approach vs your \"obvious\" approach. A major strength of more senior engineers is their ability to perceive/understand complicating factors, with nuance (see the last sentence in #4). A word of warning here... don't ask endless follow-up questions/don't get really in the weeds on every little thing. You run the risk of being seen as overly pedantic, nitpicking, or wasting time (for the pull request example, keep in mind that often the PR is only a final \"does this make sense to everyone?\" check before merging new code. So a developer might not appreciate having long conversations on every PR. For this reason, having a conversation or DMing them is often better than leaving a vague question as a PR comment).  \n4. Get involved in the design process as _early_ as possible. If you have the opportunity to sit-in on a meeting with an architect/dev lead while they design a new feature/project/service, _do it_. You won't be able to contribute (probably), and that is fine. But especially if these people are the ones you identified in #2, watching them work through a complex problem from the beginning will be a great learning experience. A big part of having engineering expertise is knowing what's important vs what is not important to the actual business requirement(s) (especially as it relates to the existing constraints of your application), not just knowing the ins and outs of your language/framework.  \n5. Talk to your coworkers about the work and build up your reputation as someone who cares. When you discover cool language features or software development practices, bring them up with people (\"I found this cool HN article the other day talking about <.NET feature>, do we use that here?\"). Then, when other devs are working on something new, they'll think \"I bet /u/Spiritual_Donkey_521 would love to hear about this.\" This can help get you exposed to parts of dev work you wouldn't normally encounter until later in your career.",

Don't sacrifice your schooling for a potential job at a company that you know isn't going to treat you well anyway.

        "body": "Sorry to hear you're going thru this.  No, not all internships are like this.  The \"this is an easy task\" and other passive aggressive responses in particular are major indicators of a fairly toxic culture in that team and very likely the company.  That's not typical of most teams, but it's also not as rare as one might wish.  (And it is more common in teams that are hiring, because those teams have a higher turnover.)\n\nToxicity aside, the overall lack of guidance sounds like what happens when the hiring team is more swamped than they expected when they signed up to have interns.  The pattern of having to drop lower priority balls in a crunch is pretty normal, and it's likely \"intern support\" is one of those lower priority balls.\n\nIn that situation, an attitude of \"interns are both cheap and temporary, let's give them a non-essential nice-to-have and if they get it working, great, if not we'll sort it out later\" is the kind of strategy some people will run with if they have some interns they don't know what to do with.  Another possibility is they're attempting a sort of extended interview, where what they wanted wasn't so much to train people as to identify people with the tenacity to get it figured out, with an intent to make a job offer to those already at the \"swim\" level of capabilities (in a complete failure to understand (or probably even comprehend the possibility) that this is a side gig for you while you're mainly trying to graduate, rather than your sole full-time work focus like their jobs are).\n\nEither way, your best outcome here is to get it running more or less ok, get a good letter of recommendation, and find a different place for your next paid position.  (Tenacity, managing burnout, and finding alternative second-best outcomes under limited support and uncertainty of project success are all important skills in this field, but ideally you'd be sort of eased into them with some decent mentoring along the way, rather than left alone to maybe figure out your burnout damage or not. Also, burnout is a pretty well-studied phenomenon, and it will serve you well into the future if you read up on the literature, as another side project for an hour or 2/week.)\n\nFor getting your actual task figured out, there's a few decent options under the guidance they've (implicitly) given that they don't want their engineers to be bothered.  You're doing the right thing by posting in external forums, this approach can help with your technical questions too.  (Plus of course the web searching you're presumably doing about the error messages and unexpected behaviors you're seeing.)\n\nYou can also try finding a person or 2 in the company (edit: or outside the company) (but not your official team and not the point of contact telling you it should be easy) who you like their vibe, and just ask if they'd be available for an hour each week or so, and if they can, see if you can collect good questions they can help you get thru efficiently, or point you in their idea of the next step, for stuff you don't know what to do with.\n\nAlso a useful trick is to keep a slide deck open and capture screenshots of useful things to ask about.  Later you can trim it into a presentation or a walkthrough of issues you still have that you can show people easily.\n\nAnyway, good luck and remember that your most important goal in this arrangement is to impress someone enough they want to work with you and will write you a letter and/or be a good future contact in another job. Getting your \"easy\" project running is a decent means to that end, but you can also potentially achieve it by showing people the hurdles you did overcome on the way to not finishing.\n\n(Btw, most sane people doing actual backend work know that nothing in this space is as easy as it sounds, so the people telling you this are probably either lying to put pressure on you or not all that experienced themselves and mistaken about the difficulty of something they haven't attempted. Possibly they just forgot how they learned the things they know now and how hard it was, but probably they don't know how to do it either, and would take at least twice as long as their estimate.)",

Just my two cents:\n\nWhat is not ok \n\n* No onboarding structure: Being dropped into a codebase on day 4 with minimal context isn’t setting you up for success—it’s just irresponsible.\n* No dedicated mentor: Saying “this should be easy” to a new hire without offering guidance is lazy management. Interns and entry-level engineers usually need a few weeks to a few months to become productive contributors (reference: The Manager’s Path by Camille Fournier).\n* Poor leadership: The people supervising you either don’t know how to mentor—or they just don’t care to. That reflects poorly on them, not on you.\n   * If I were mentoring a second-year college student, I’d fully expect them to get stuck and need hands-on guidance at first. That’s normal. Once they’ve merged a few pull requests and built some confidence, then I’d start stepping back and letting them operate more independently. That’s how real growth happens.\n\nWhat you can do \n\n* Document everything: Keep track of what you tried, what went wrong, error logs, who you asked for help, what they said, etc. It shows initiative and covers you if anyone questions your effort. Learn as much as you can but do not stress over it after working hours.\n* Ask for clarification in writing Something like: *“Just to confirm, we’re expected to deploy a live service to EC2 using Docker and environment variables—is that correct?”* This can prompt a reality check or at least put expectations on the record. \n\nThis sounds like bad internship experience, and that’s OK. Internships are a two-way street: *they* are evaluating you, but *you* are also learning about them. If this is how this team treats interns, I wouldn’t want to work there full time. Don’t let their disorganization hurt your confidence. And like others said—prioritize school. That’ll outlast this internship.\n\nMany people have gone through rough starts and still gone on to build great careers. Doing your best in a poorly managed environment speaks volumes about your resilience. Try to take what you can from the experience, learn from it, and keep moving forward. One difficult internship or job won’t define your future—it’s just one chapter, not the whole story.",

For example, Python doesn't natively have arrays. Instead, it has lists, which handle lots of things for you that you would have to do in other languages. It's good to have a knowledge of how these things work so you can better understand how to program in other languages as well, since Python won't work for all applications. \n\nYou shouldn't \"choose\" C++, you use the language that is best for your application, especially if you're doing personal projects. At my job, I've automated a ton of my daily work away, using exclusively Python, because it's so easy to do and simple to write, debug, and adapt to new situations. You're exactly right with your analogy of a hatchet vs an axe. There are a lot of people who will tell you that you need an axe, when in reality, you only need the hatchet. \n\nBut to answer your question, yes, Python is absolutely a real programming language, and no, it doesn't matter that it's simple. It just helps to have a little knowledge of what's really going on. Once you have a good grasp on the language, you should try branching out into a different language to learn a little bit more about programming. I personally learned Java after Python, then C++, then C (since I primarily work on microcontrollers now), and that really helped me understand what's going on, since C++ and C do not hold your hand at all. Java is easier to learn than C++, which is why I recommend it after Python. But you'll have a million people telling you what they think is the best way to do something. In reality, if you aren't doing this for work, then the best advice I can give you is just to have fun. This is a super enjoyable hobby and a great skill to have, but don't let someone suck the life out of it for you by telling you that there's one deterministic way to enjoy your programming journey. There isn't. Have fun, enjoy what you're doing, and the knowledge and skills will come ten times faster than if you were to force yourself to do something you don't want because of some stupid arbitrary rule that someone put forth.",

They don't do many for complex tricks because analyzing the number to see if the trick applies would take longer than just computing the answer.\n\nSo how fast can a modern processor \"grind everything out\" for something like an integer multiplication?\n\nThe important thing to understand is that it's hard-coded in circuitry. It doesn't have to execute a bunch of steps to multiply, one at a time - the circuits are right there in the chip and they parallelize as much as possible.\n\nThat said, multiplication is not instantaneous. On a modern processor you can expect it to take 3 - 5 clock cycles, whereas something like addition can be done in 1 clock cycle.\n\nSo, it is worth checking for some really easy tricks like multiplying by 1 or 0. Maybe multiplying by 2 even. Those checks are simple enough that the processor can detect them when decoding the instruction and shift it to another instruction, and that's exactly what's done.\n\nBut, there are a lot of \"tricks\" that humans use to save time that wouldn't make sense for computer processors, because they can just \"grind out\" the answer faster than checking it.\n\nIn general when you write code in a language like C or Python, the compiler/interpreter does some easy optimizations, and then your processor does some easy optimizations. Neither of them are likely to do tricky optimizations - they're usually just not worth the cost.\n\nThere are specialized mathematical programming environments, like Mathematica, where using number theory and other advanced tricks are possible.",

If they are both 0 or 1 the first bit of the sum is 0, if the are different values then the first bit of the sum is 1.  Now for the second bit of the sum you have the logic:\n\nIf there is no carry from the first bit, xor the second bits.  If there is a carry then you now have the truth table:\n\n0 + 0 = 1  \n0 + 1 = 0 (with a carry)  \n1 + 0 = 0 (with a carry)  \n1 + 1 = 1 (with a carry)\n\nRemember that there is carry you have an additional 1 coming it.  This truth table is a xor and a not.  Now you can add in the logic for the 3rd bit and so on.\n\nYou might want to read: [https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb\\_7.html](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_7.html) which appears to give a good description of a binary adder.\n\nAs for shifting instead of multiplications all I can answer is probably not. This is because it would increase the time to do most of the multiplications, because now you have a first step of checking if only 1 bit is set on one of the numbers then do a shift, otherwise continue with the multiplication.  That check is only going to help rarely, and the check does take time.\n\nNow with a computer the compiler might notice that you are always multiplying a number by a constant like 16 and insert a shift instruction into the output rather than doing a multiplication.  But that means you are always multiplying some number not known at compile time by a constant that is a power of 2. Most compilers will actually do all the math it can during compile time so if you have it calculate x \\* (1 + 3) / 2 then the compiler might look at that say oh, you want really want to just multiple by 2, oh that is a power of 16, you just want to shift by one, rather than making the computer always add 1  + 3 multiple that by the input value then divide by 2.",

By limiting the amount of data a number can have your precision is always limited, but almost always sufficient for a lot of cases. If you want things more precise you have to throw more memory and cpu at it. Depending on the amount of bytes you throw at it you get accuracy to around 3, 7, 15 or 34 significant numbers.\n\nBut my favorite is the square root trick in a games:  \nThe distance between two points is Square root of (dX\\^2+dY\\^2+dZ\\^2) (according to some greek guy).\n\nBut square roots are very expensive. So when trying to sort by distance developers will just skip the square root and find the smallest dX\\^2+dY\\^2+dZ\\^2.\n\nOther than that: compilers will do all kinds to tricks to reduce complexity, which is done with optimisation loops.\n\ne.g. constant folding. If you write const a = 10+20, the compiler will just make it const a = 30. Other tricks are loop unrolling (make a for loop into seperate statements if it's a known low number of iterations), and algebraic simplication.",

        "body": "Have you ever completed a course by yourself? The reason I ask is because there's a reason people go to university and major in computer science. This content isn't easy. Keep in mind, in the US, it takes 4 years to graduate with a CS degree.\n\nTo be fair, in the US, you have to take a bunch of other courses. Maybe 1/4 of your courses are CS courses, and the rest are some related courses (say, in math and sciences) plus more general education (humanities such as history and English).\n\nEven so, there's a linearity to the CS curriculum where certain courses are taken before others. Much of which courses you focus on will depend on your goals. \n\nIn any case, if you want to master this, you could go back to school. Yes, unrealistic, but as pointed out earlier, it's tough for CS majors to complete this curriculum with decent grades. They have the added benefit of time, friends, teaching assistants, professors, and perhaps even free tutoring (or paid tutoring). CS majors are often under time pressure to learn this material so some feel, even after a semester, that they missed stuff along the way.\n\nOK, now to address your question, this is my opinion on what to take.\n\n1. Discrete Math \n * This is a precursor to data structures and algorithms. I would say it's not fully required. Discrete math, in my opinion, should be a course where you learn how to do mathematical proofs. Specifically, direct proofs, proof by contradiction, and the various induction proofs (weak, strong, structural). It should also cover formal logic, in particular, propositional and predicate calculus. The rest of discrete math is a bunch of topics where you can apply your knowledge of proofs. Many self-taught learners tend to skip this and head into DSA, and that can work too.\n1. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)\n * If you were to take a real courses in DSA, especially algorithms, then you'd do work on solving recurrence relations. This is the math behind big O notation. Otherwise, you could skip that, and just know certain algorithms O(n) or O(lg n) or whatever. It would help to work out book problems, but I think implementing the various data structures and algorithms is educational. For example, I don't use pointers for work (at least, not to build linked data structures).\n1. Computer Architecture\n * I taught this a number of times. My current belief is the goal of a computer architecture course is to show you can build a CPU that can run a simple assembly language out of a clock, a flip-flop (a one-bit register), and logic gates. I had envisioned the class building this in software, but never got around to doing that. Personally, I think CS majors learn that the computer isn't completely magic (yes, it does do a lot) and realize, yes, 0's and 1's can make a program do something.\n\nBeyond that, I think you can read about the rest (e.g., computer networking and operating systems). I've taken OS before, so building something (again, super simple) is interesting, but you realize that real OSes are extremely complex, but at its core, it's something you can understand if you strip it to its bare essentials.\n\nThe question, should you choose to study this, is how much time you can devote to this, and how deeply do you want to study it given a lack of resources. If you can find some online courses offered through a reputable university (you wouldn't get credit, but you could follow the content), then that can help structure your learning.\n\nAt this point, you need to pick an initial starting point, which is probably data structures and algorithms as that's the most pertinent and comes up in job interviews.",

Return is how the function gives you what you ask for.\n\nTake some code like:\n```\nfunction timesTwo(int i) int {\n    return i * 2;\n}\n```\n\nThis is a function, which means it can be called from other places.  It has an `int` *argument*, `i`; this means that, whenever someone wants to call this function, they will have to supply some int to be used in place of `i`.  The final `int` after the right parenthesis denotes the *return type*.  In other words, whenever you call this function, you are *asking for an int*.  So, in all, the function represents a sort of contract: I give you an int, and you give me an int back.\n\nHere's how you might use this function:\n\n```\nint x = 5;\nint y = timesTwo(x);\n```\n\nWhat's going on here?  You have an `int`, `x`.  Then you initialize another `int`, `y`, and assign it to *the result of the function call*.  As we said, calling timesTwo means supplying an int, and then receiving one in return.  Here we are supplying `x` - that is, `5`.\n\n`timesTwo` receives `5` and uses it in place of `i` in the function body, so we can read the return statement as `return 5 * 2` which evaluates to `return 10`.\n\nNow, timesTwo promised its caller that it would give it back an int, and that is exactly what `return` does - it gives `10` back as the result of the call and gives control back to the caller, which assigns the returned value to `y`.\n\nEssentially, the return type of a function allows you to use a call to that function *as* a value of the return type in most places in your code, because the return type is essentially a promise that the function will give you a value to use there.  `Return` is how functions actually make good on that promise.",

Maybe the bugs are worked out but it needs to be X amount faster. Then, you can take a step back and tell yourself you can code Project A that meets these exact specifications. This way, you live in the tangible world instead of chasing an abstract right/wrong.",

What language, and libraries do you have to or want to use? Systems development? What tools do you want to build and what hardware will you be supporting? One reason people get hung up on where to start is they don't know what road they are on or even where they want to go. Answering these question will narrow things down considerably. Once you know what road you're on, pick a destination that interests you, something that you would enjoy building and may even use yourself when you're done. If you want to get even more spicy then build something for someone else to their specs. \n\nOnce you've determined your environment and what you're building then start small and keep building. Most big projects are a series of smaller projects that are fit together to form a whole. List what you need in the order that you will need it. For example, a website to provide a public bulletin board would need:\n\n1 ) A landing page that explains the purpose of the website\n\n2 ) A login page that consists of a page to create a login, a page to actually login once a login is created and a page to recover a forgotten password. \n\n3 ) An admin page that allows a user create, modify and cancel their postings\n\n4 ) A postings page that shows the postings from the various users.\n\nThat's a simple example, and far from complete, but you get the idea. Each of those steps can be a separate mini project on your way to creating the whole project.",

It does not hold your hand and allows you to make mistakes and shows you really how computers work. After that, build difficult projects, don't watch step by step tutorials or copy code. It will be a struggle, but you will learn a lot when you force yourself to do these exercises. I suggest things like a web server in C, Building an ORM in any OO language.

This is used for storing things, and looking things up that need to be retained longer than the page is open. Frequently used to serve login systems, provide details about something pulled from a data source like a database and many more things.\n\nThose are all the bits you need to create a website you can run and test locally and covers the majority of things you'll want to learn if it is new to you.\n\nIf you wanted to learn to build all the things for the website and understand how they work then that's all you need.\n\nIf you are more interested in getting something up and running quickly without learning the basics then these options below exist.

Therefore, c^(k+1) ∊ O(cᵏ) cannot be true, which in turn means that O(c^(k+1)) cannot be a subset of O(cᵏ). Therefore, by the definition of set equality, the two sets cannot be equivalent.",

Here, **O(c\\*(k+1)) = O(c\\*k + c)**. Here,  **c\\*k > c ie c\\*k** will be **asymptotically bigger** than **c ,** because c,k are variables and nonetheless will be positive, and since in Big-O, we care about the dominant term, therefore it will be **equal** to **O(c\\*k**). An example can be c = 10 and k = 10. c\\*k = 10\\*10 = 100. c \\* (k+1) = 10 \\* 11 = 110, which is asymptotically equal. \n\nHowever, for the other case ie **O(c\\^k) Vs O(c \\^(k+1))** ; here **O(c\\^(k+1)) = O(c \\* c \\^ k)**. However , c is a variable and **not** a constant. Therefore, **c\\^(k+1)** is **not** asymptotically same as **c\\^k**. Therefore, **O(c\\^k)** and **O(c \\^(k+1))** are **not equal.**  An example can be c = 10 and k = 4 . c\\^k = 10\\^4 and c\\^(k+1) = 10\\^5 ; a **10 times** increase in the running time**.** \n\nThis is my interpretation , I could be wrong as well. Please correct if my approach is wrong. \n\n(Also, note that though c,k are input variables, when we use them in Big O , it is expected that they are large positive values, because we care about the asymptotic growth as the input size gets large. So all inputs are expected to grow larger and larger. For people who are not familiar with the word 'asymptotic', in general it means that how fast the running time will grow when input size increases. Take two functions : n\\^2 and n , where n is the input. For some duration, n\\^2 and n will run in parallel, but as n increases, n\\^2 will grow rapidly compared to n , then we say that n\\^2 is asympototically larger than n. )",

It doesn't matter how simple, or whether it has been used before.  The first games I wrote were:  A top down racing game similar to Rally-X.  A top down shooter similar to 1942.  A pong game with powerups.  A pong game played on an elliptical playing field where both players could move around the entire ellipse and the ball changed colour when you hit it (so you lost points if the ball went out of the ellipse when it was your colour).\n\nThese were all simple games, and some of them never got finished, but it taught me a lot about how to build things, and projects like these helped me land my first job as a graphics dev.\n\nFor school, make sure you pass.  Go to office hours.  Find other students you can study with.  There were times during my university days when I locked myself in my room for 2-3 days.  No computer.  Just a textbook and some paper.  I read the textbook and took notes by hand.  Then I read the textbook again and took more notes.  Then I copied my notes and cleaned them up.  Then I copied them and cleaned them up again, until I was at the point where I could probably write them out again without looking at the textbook.  I did whatever it took to learn the material.\n\nIt will take time.  Find time every day to put some effort into it, even if it is only ten minutes.  After I had three kids, I wondered how I would ever be able to learn something new again.  Then I realized that even ten minutes a day adds up to \\~60 hours per year.  The first year I realized that, I taught myself how to play the guitar just by spending 10 minutes a day practicing.  Then piano the next year, then flute the year after that.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that it will take effort and time, but you can do it, and it will be worth it in the end.  But it starts by choosing a project and building it from scratch.  Then rinse and repeat as many times as it takes until things start to sink in.",

It's crazy.\n\nIf youre having trouble understanding what you don't understand, to the point where asking questions at all is hard, I do have one trick to take with a massive grain of salt: explain what you can to AI and ask it to rephrase what you say or point out what areas you're leaving out the most. Honestly, the act of explaining things to someone often shows me what I'm missing, but it also helps me when my brain is mush and I can't even begin to explain my lack of understanding. I'll do my best to explain what I can, even if it's between curses and insults and self-admonishment, and it's usually able to parse through the mess and pull out a bit of self confidence. It reminds me I AM absorbing something, but it also forces me to look at what I'm missing. Don't rely on it to spoon feed you the information because it's been proven that this negatively effects your ability to find the information alone, but having it rephrase your knowledge can help with your thinking of it, and, importantly, give you keywords to help your real searching, which you should always be doing outside of AI.",

You might therefore conclude that you can get it without much experience because 1. it's asking for a junior and 2. you can just obtain the certs.\n\nYou see, \"junior\" is there because it's an entry to the role of a pentester, but not in an entry domain. It's a junior role for someone who has been an network administrator for 5 years, or a junior role for someone that did different levels of SOC support for 5 years etc. You will be expected to have x amount of years in lead up roles before you're hired as a pentester. You could for example get an IT helpdesk job, during which you can get your Sec+ or similar. From there you can try and move into a sysadmin role or similar, where you will actually be working in a real environment for a few years, during which you might try getting OSCP and similar certs, and only then would you be applying for a junior pentester job, only after you spent years solving issues and learning how things actually work in practice.\n\nYou need actual experience working in real IT environments before you try to become an expert at any of its domains. You wouldn't be doing security audits on code written in C++ if you don't have years of experience working writing C++, similarly you wouldn't be doing network infrastructure security implementations if you never even set up an AP, a switch, a vlan, a domain controller etc. So say you do have 10 years of writing C++ in various areas, and now you want to shift to cybersec, only then would you be looking for \"junior\" positions in which you would do C++ code audits, not because you don't have experience with C++, but because you don't have experience doing audits in a c++ environment.",

Unless you have a reasonably powerful Nvidia GPU it can be a bit challenging but I can sum it up for you. \n\nGet comfy ui and watch a few quick tutorials about it. Then learn about something called \"IP adapter\". Basically, it allows you to take an image and upload it to comfy UI to create images based on the likeness of the uploaded image.\n\nThe models you use are open free to download from within the comfy UI GUI. Most people use stable diffusion, but if you have a really powerful GPUs like 4090/3090 you can use Flux. \n\nOr, if you're looking for something specific (stylistic artistic styles) you can check out civitai.com (huggingface for image generation). You can find a wide variety of LoRAs (sort of like really fine tuned mini models) for exactly what you're looking for. After typing this out, I would probably avoid going too deep down this rabbit hole if you only have 15 days. \n\nAs for the video generation, I don't have a lot of experience with video generation models, but diffusion generative AI (video generation) is very similar to image generation as far as I know. So, I imagine there are models that exist that can operate with IP adapter etc. However, image generation is very computationally expensive and video generation just takes it to another level. \n\nIf you don't have access to powerful GPUs, look into some of the virtual machine services. They are fairly cheap, maybe a couple dollars per hour or find a way to use a free Google Collab for compute. \n\nThen, just spool up python and create a gradio web UI for the user to do all of this connected through API. It sounds like a lot, and it kind of is, but you could definitely pull it off in 15 days.\n\nThis is a weird way to do a hackathon, IMO. Mostly because they're giving you what they want the result to be. I think a better approach would be \"Build a whimsical app that leverages generative AI (image and or video)\"",

If an attacker gets access to a database with the hashed passwords, they could just make a dummy client just directly send each hashed password and get access to every single account. \n\nIf the hashing is done server-side and an attacker gets access to the database, the hashed passwords are useless since they don't know people's original passwords which will be put through the hash. \n\nIf you really really are worried you can hash both client side and server side using two completely separate cryptographically secure hashing systems. \n\nHowever this doesn't add very much security - if a hacker compromises an individual's password they can still run the hash, or if they compromise the hash they can just send it directly as a dummy client. The only thing you're protecting is a potential client trust (e.g. what if they're storing the passwords in plaintext?). However regulations state that you can't store or print the passwords anywhere and any trustworthy company does not do this, just receiving the password as regular text, hashing to store/check, and immediately forgetting the text.",

Only time an admin gets to access serverside data is when a user is banned/suspended (because in this enviroment it means you either put the server's security at risk or repeatedly violated TOS/Server TOS) and the data is needed for the administrators (namely the owner of the server, for other purposes there is a separate security role called moderators, whom get lots less info for the exact reasons some of you pointed out) to debug what exactly did you break. My best guess was to save the password as the hash to prevent the server from knowing the exact password.  \n\\- I'm not in the US, so my laws aren't the same, but this was a big oversight in my part and I'd like to apologize for it. Still, all shared info in that regard has been useful, so for that I thank you all.\n\nFor one final question, though: If the server does not know the password, how do I actually check password veracity? Do I take the password, hash it again and check against the hash?",

Though it's ideal that developers only get access to the information they need to test and debug their code, this isn't always necessary. Adding a bunch of restrictions will make it harder for the developers for a slight amount of added trust.\n\nFor HIPAA compliance developers may see patient records and information to debug stuff and work on code and features, but the data that they see cannot contain personally identifiable information like name/email address/phone number/home address. Since there are also people working on the login portion and might need to see this information, there's a separation or \"iron curtain\" in place where the people who work with systems that handle personally identifiable information cannot have access to medical records or information. \n\nOther industries just make you \"promise really really hard\" under the consequence of huge lawsuits and financial repercussions. Like if you're working at a bank you might get information that Apple is executing an order to sell $1 billion of USD over the course of 3 days, or even non-public information about acquisitions and mergers. Not everyone has access to this information at the bank however, just the people working on the computer systems or on the deals. A person could potentially abuse this and frontrun their own trades or hand the information off to a relative. However IMO the stakes are too high to do this in nearly every case, and everyone that has access to this non-public information has a restriction on buying individual stocks, commodities contracts, or large amounts of any currency without explicit approval from compliance.\n\nI don't know about the realm of modern laws for social media, but I do know at one point in time there was a creepy Facebook employee that was using their position and access to data stalk a user. Since then Facebook has added additional restrictions on the amount of information granted to developers, and getting more information about someone specific had to be run through a compliance team to ensure it was for debugging/programming reasons.\n\nThe one place where this material non-public information restriction does not exist, unfortunately, is for the US congress. They are given zero restrictions on stocks or products they can purchase or sell, and a huge ass 45 day window to report trades. It's concerning especially considering the amount of non-public information they deal with. Like if a congressperson knows that there is a huge deal in the works for a car manufacturer, they may buy the stock with no restriction, and only have to report the trade way after the deal has gone through and the stock has made significant gains.",

You’re a member of a team.\n\nYeah, the work is hard and gnarly. Companies don’t get successful without accumulating a lot of lumpy and complex experience. In our trade, that messy experience gets crammed into our code bases. Academic approaches often make simplifying assumptions. Sometime, ask your professors about software they have to actually USE, not just dream up: grade reporting, grant applying, etc. \n\nWhen the heat is on, put on your anthropologist’s hat and observe how the org’s customs and taboos affect your workplace. \n\nAnd rest assured that they value you. I’ve had a couple of interns I didn’t value much, and they stayed far far less than a year. \n\nYou got this! Hope and strength to you.",

        "body": "I would start by having a frank discussion with your mentor or manager. Are you doing well? Do they have any feedback for you? What would you need to do in order to receive a full-time offer?\n\nIMO it's somewhat unprofessional/odd that you were not given that feedback: part of the job of a manager is to make sure every employee knows if they're meeting expectations/remove uncertainty about where they stand. But that's by-the-by -- I think the important thing here is to get direct info + directly ask for the feedback you're looking for.\n\n> I’ve been doing a programming internship at a big, globally known company for a year now\n\nThe length of your internship is pretty unusual. Maybe this is a regional thing, but at least in my corner of the world (US west coast), most internships last ~3-4 months, typically during the student's summer break.\n\nIn any case, I do think it's reasonable for you to be feeling burnt out. I don't think it's reasonable to expect you to juggle both schooling and work for this amount of time.\n\n> When I landed this internship, I had zero technical knowledge and was just starting my degree.\n\nI'm a little surprised by this, tbh -- somebody with zero technical background doesn't have the ability to contribute in a meaningful way in a programming role. It's an odd pick for an intern; usually you want somebody with partial experience so the intern mentor doesn't need to spend time covering the basics.\n\nDid the company know this when they hired you + ask you to go through some training program? Or was this more of a hybrid internship, where you applied some of your other skills in in addition to programming? What were their expectations?\n\nTBH my first instinct here was that the company did not set you up for success by hiring you at such an early stage in your career.\n\n> I made mistakes, of course,but no one really explained what I was doing wrong or how I could do better. \n\nAny internship program worth its salt should assign you a dedicated mentor. Do you have one? If not, can you ask your manager (or whoever is managing the internship program) to assign you one?\n\n> over time, I’ve started to feel like I’m being excluded. Nothing direct or obvious, but there are signs. I try to contribute, show interest, ask questions… but everything I do seems to go unnoticed. [...snip...] Despite being an intern, it often feels like we’re expected to deliver at the level of someone with years of experience.\n\nIt's hard to tell what's happening here without more specifics.\n\nFor example, maybe what's happening is that you rose to the occasion and people are treating as you as having roughly the same skill as a junior engineer -- and maybe they're leaving you alone since you seem to be doing fine and are not realizing you're actually struggling to keep up? Or alternatively, maybe they're disengaging because they need to focus on their own work now, or are burnt out themselves with teaching and mentoring? It's a bit hard to say.\n\n> Lately, I’ve been thinking that maybe I should try working at a smaller company—somewhere with a slower pace, less pressure, and where I might actually be able to learn and breathe.\n\nUsually an internship has a concrete end date; I'd try sticking it out until then. If yours does not, then I'm not quite sure what's going on tbh.\n\nOther things to try:\n\n- Quit to focus on your schoolwork. Find another internship next summer.\n- Add your current internship to your resume; use it to help you find an internship at a different but similarly well-regarded company.\n- Ask if you can transfer to a different team. Maybe the working culture will be different there?\n- Tell your manager that you're struggling to balance school and work and seeing if they can help adjust your workload. You're a student -- it's reasonable and correct for you to put your education first.",

        "body": "I'm a dude in my early 40s, been writing software for pay well over 20 years now and this is just how it feels sometimes, especially when you're just starting out. But you'll also hit periods of this at new jobs, when joining new teams, starting new projects in parts of a product you haven't worked on before, when using new technologies, coming back to old technologies you haven't used in a while that have changed underneath you, on a Tuesday when the stars don't align just the right way...\n\nBasically, get ready to feel like a big ole dummy a lot of the time. And it never stops feeling awful when it happens, no matter how good you've become at the things that used to feel so difficult and complex.\n\nBut I promise: you *will* get better at what you're doing right now. In a few years you're going to look back at what you didn't understand or what you've misunderstood and wonder \"why did that seem so hard? It's so simple, it's so clear to me now!\"\n\nAnd you'll also get better *at getting better*. That feeling of *none of this makes sense and it makes me so mad* might only last a few month, or weeks, or days.\n\nNow, to improving your current predicament. You mentioned not getting feedback or support. It might be time to start asking for it directly from individuals. Here are some tricks I use:\n\n* \"Hey, I did <whatever> this way and it just feels wrong to me but I don't have enough context to know why or what would be better. Do you hav some time to go over it with me?\"\n* \"I'm about to start <whatever task>. Are there some other places in the code we've done something similar I could base my work off?\" Then see who wrote this and ask them for help too.\n* \"I could use some help just getting started. Do you have 30 minutes to [pair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) with me to get me going in the right direction?\"\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable asking directly, ask your manager similar question but ask them who would be good to speak to get answers. Then go to these people and say \"I'm doing <X> and <Manager> said you could help\" or ask your manager to ask them on your behalf.\n\nIf your teammates and manager won't help, it might be time to start asking in more public forums at the company. There are likely helpful people on other teams or in other parts of the organization. If *nobody* can or will help you your company might be, and this is the technical term, *fucked.*\n\nIt sounds like your career is already going to benefit from the reflected glory of the company. While money is nice, the most valuable benefit of working somewhere this early in your career is access to people who will help you learn and grow. It could very well be time to start looking around.\n\nFinally, once you're past this slump: work to model the behavior you wish you were seeing right now. Maybe someone is going to help unblock you or maybe you're going to power through on your own. Either way, hold that door open for the next person.",

There should absolutely be realistic expectations set for what work you can produce which should be lower than graduate level. \n\nYou should also have someone working as your buddy / supervisor to help you out with learning and figuring out what you’re doing wrong. \n\nIt sounds to me a bit like this company is trying to use interns as cheap labor. \n\nAlso remember impostor syndrome is a big thing in this industry. If you feel you’re doing badly don’t be too hard on yourself. Remember you’re still learning and it’s going to take time. \n\nThe industry is rough at the moment so my advice would be first speak to your manager to see how they view your performance and what you could do to improve / and also find out what support you could get from them. \n\nLook around for other jobs at the same time, but realise it might take a while.

I can't land one either, not even an internship. But in both of our cases, that's the job market situation and not our lack of qualifications. I'm overqualified for Junior positions, but not getting any responses as laid off Mid devs are applying for these too. Job market is quite bad right now, and not just in tech, but especially in tech. In the end though, it's a numbers game, you'll probably take 6-7 months to land a job, but it gets easier from the moment you get your foot into the door.",

I would (based on what I know) not consider it the equivalent of CS50x which is based on a Harvard course. That is, it's not aimed at a Stanford CS major (with Stanford being one of the highest regarded CS programs in the US), and therefore might be too challenging for a typical beginner. It feels like it's more beginner friendly and slower-paced.\n\nIn that case, I'd probably do CS50x. CS50p you could even do along with CS50x but they have different emphasis. CS50p is more like a series of Python exercises and is not CS50x in Python. CS50x is trying to introduce computer science concepts including programming, but covers other topics (later on) beyond just programming.\n\nI would recommend CS50x. Search for `cs50x edX 2025` and you can sign up for free at any time, and go at your own pace.\n\nBecause you've already had a year of programming, you should find the programming assignments (called problem sets) easier than most, but they are still fairly challenging. Most of the core material is in C though the first \"week\" is in Scratch which is a visual language aimed at beginners. Although the course is broken down in weeks, you can go at your own pace, either as fast as the course goes or much slower, depending on how much time you have available.\n\nThat's my two cents.\n\nOtherwise, you can look for courses in data structures and algorithms.\n\nMany of the courses you've mentioned are aimed at beginning programmers with no experience. CS50x, admittedly, is fast-paced. The nice part is you'd learn some C on top of Python you already know, which could be useful.",

The reality is you earn college credit by paying for it, but as an admitted college student at Harvard (the yearly tuition is about 60,000 US dollars which is around 52,000 Euros). In any case, it's an introductory course at Harvard, so it's not worth a whole lot. But, as mentioned before, there are ways to get it for free once you've completed the course.\n\nThere's a bunch of follow-up courses. You could even start CS50w which is by the same folks that made CS50x which is \"web programming\" in Python.

Pulling a tiny function from an external library just adds another attack vector to your software — sometimes over something you could write yourself in 10 lines.\n\nAI also plays into this now: it’s easy to just generate small helper functions on the fly instead of bloating your projects with unnecessary third-party libraries.\n\nBasically: keep it simple unless there’s a real need to get fancy.",

Imagine you have a function that is called calcUserData ehich gets a user and does some processing. In this case you would only care about the processing part, as that is the main functionality of this function. Problen is now that this function calls the db to get the user data, and wr of course dont want to include that in the unit test as we ONLY want to test the function.\n\nThis is were you use testing doubles as you mentioned, mocks, fakes and stubs. Mocks tell you if an interaction happened, for example you can check if the database function getUserData was actually called by calcUserData.\n\nFakes are working implementations but simplified. Lets say that instead of mocking away the database, you want to use an in memory db, or you could even store values into a list if all you want is something to put in and retrieve data from.\n\nStubs are when you want to pre-define a response. Imagine you have a function called isAdmin, which simply checks the db if the user is an admin or not, instead of actually calling the db we can simply stub it to return True or False. This is useful when you want to force an interaction. Imagine you want to test if you correctly throw an error to the user if they are not an admin, you can do that with stubbing.\n\nThe mindset you need for unit testing is using these 3 tools to force yourself to ONLY test what a small piece of code does. The mistake people make is including dependencies into unit tests which makes them closer to integration tests.\n\nHope this helped a bit, in a rush need to go to work now but if you have any more questions just comment Ill get back to you.",

        "body": "You might be jumping a bit ahead of yourself here... Here's a brief rundown of how this all works:\n\nYour PC has a network card. That NIC uses some black magic to establish itself as a given IP on your local network, let's assign it as 192.168.1.20.\n\nAny traffic on your network will be able to talk to your network card using that address, and if your computer talks to anything else on your network then the recipient will see it got a package from that address.\n\nOne such device on your network is a router, which is also connected to your ISP's network.\n\nWhen your computer tries to make a request to something not on your local network, say.... 8.8.8.8, then it asks the router if it knows how to get to 8.8.8.8. The router then asks the ISP, the ISP knows and then tells the router which tells the computer, the computer then sends the packet to the router to give to the ISP to give to 8.8.8.8.\n\nA similar process works for resolving domain names to server IPs.\n\nSo when you go to google.com, your browser asks your network card to ask your router to ask your ISP if that's possible. It is, and a request is sent to whatever address that google.com resolves to, \"Give me your home page.\"\n\nGoogle's server receives that request and after some processing sends back an HTML file, and probably a css and a JavaScript file. So an HTML file comes from Google to your ISP to your router to your network card to your browser, and a web page renders. Then your browser also executed the JavaScript that got sent and applies the css, not necessarily in that order. The JavaScript can then phone home by asking the browser to ask the card to ask the router to ask the ISP to give a message to Google, and so the cycle continues.\n\nTL;DR: By the time you get a webpage, a connection to the server has already been made at least once. The browser handles most of the details of connecting. The JS can make subsequent requests if the programmer deems it necessary",

Where do we start and where do we end.\n\nLet's start near the top, and cover the upper level bit.\n\nWhen you fire up your web browser, you basically get a blank canvas.\n\nYou type in the Domain Name of the website and hit go/enter.\n\nThat domain name is then looked up using a name resolution system called DNS (rabbit hole one) to get it to resolve to an address. This is very similar to you looking up your friend Bob in the contacts list on your phone, since names are easier than numbers.\n\nThe browser then sends a request to the server(s) residing at the address it got to download your web page. (Another rabbit hole here). This is done using the HTTP protocol (more rabbit hole), the web page is then likely to be created using HTML as the markup language (more rabbit holes). The HTML might inform the browser it needs additional bits which require additional requests to the server or even other servers. These include things like stylesheets (CSS) to make things look pretty, code (JavaScript), pictures (PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc), videos (MPEG4, etc), sound/music (MP3, WAV, etc), and others.\n\nAfter the first HTML page is downloaded the browser will start to render the page and all the content and the code may start to be executed. The code might do nothing until you interact with the page, or it might send a request to a server for some dynamic data, which would be another HTTP request to some server somewhere.\n\nEach HTTP request might involve a different server which we don't have the address for yet, so that would be another set of DNS requests to look up those addresses.\n\nThat's the near top level of how a website works with your web browser. \n\nYour next question might be how all these abbreviations, protocols, and the like work and how they all work together and for that we have a variety of central standards that specify how these work so everyone that needs to can implement their own. The majority of these are what are called RFCs (requests for comment) managed by the IETF (internet engineering task force) and we also have the w3c (world wide web consortium) and a few other organizations/groups made up of industry specialists like IANA (they're more involved in the DNS side).\n\nWe have a generic model for a lot of this called the OSI model, and that allows us to navigate the rabbit holes and find the occasional breathable pocket.\n\nHope that helps, Wikipedia has a lot of the extra information you might want to learn about, but beware of the rabbit holes (they're everywhere).",

Also, it's a lot easier IMO to manage env variables, bash scripts, cron jobs, the list goes on. Linux and mac are just a lot more prevalent in the open source community and install instructions for libraries often assume you're using unix, or the windows instructions are an afterthought. That said, I wouldn't sweat it too much.

Translating from one file to another is difficult, as each file format contains a unique representation of data. You would need to go through the file format specification of both file types, then create a program that parses one file format, create an intermediate representation, and then outputs it into the desired file format. You would have to do this for each conversion type you want. \n\nIts difficult enough that there are multiple companies dedicated to making these programs, so you should approach it more as a possible learning experience rather than building something practical.\n\nYou could make a simple program where you use a pre-existing library for the file conversion, but at that point it would probably be better to use another program entirely.",

That being said, I think Go would be a good language to write a lower-level implementation of these tools, it's jsut that it would require a deep understanding of the filetypes you're concerned with converting between. If you want the challenge, I'd pick Go, C++, or Rust (in that order because I've never used Rust yet). Also you can't beat Python's simplicity and elegance, if production level speed isn't a concern, or you don't expect to need to batch operations, then you can write these tools out fully in pure python. Writing your own conversion software in Python then trying to use it for heavy work might feel sluggish if you're not very particular about optimization.",

Its like drawing rectangles under a curve for the first 2 weeks of calc 1 ... if you got the concept 30 min into it, the next 2 weeks are blah blah.\n\nTake data structures: almost all modern languages have either these built into the language or libraries where they are done for you.  It serves you no purpose to build a linked list out of pointers in C; first, its inefficient (page faults), second its error prone (pointers and inexperience don't mix), and thirdly as I said, its already there to be used in a library or language innate.  What you need to know is when to use what data structures, and that isn't even well explained in the courses (they focus on reinventing them, not how to use them!).  So go review a web site (not AI generated, find a human written one) on when to use what data structures.\n\nBig-O is just a jargon notation.  Its like the math class on convergence of sequences (if you had that one?) where you examine the dominating term to see if it converges on infinity... except here we look for it to converge on an exponent.  So bubble sort, where you go over the whole list of say numbers, find the smallest one, move it one location at a time until it gets to the top, repeat for the list except ignore the top item, then next time ignore the top 2 items...  converges on N\\*N amount of work being done to sort the data, which you can review online how to get there but its 2 nested loops effectively over N each, so its not too hard to see (this one).  Proving an algorithm takes however many operations is helpful to know if its good at its job.  The good news is that studying algorithms will include an explanation of how to do big-O & use it.\n\nWhich leads me to algorithms.  While a LOT of algorithms are included in languages and libraries, you still need to study them and to be able to solve your own problems using either the known common ones strung together or a totally new thing.  I advise you to then do a quick overview of datastructures as I said above, and after that, do a pretty solid study of intro to algorithms and keep on digging into it as deep as you think is useful.  I recommend not getting trapped/bogged down in graphs or graph theory unless you think you will be using that stuff (its pretty rare in most fields).\n\nafter those, study object oriented programming if you have not gone deep into it.  The last thing to do is design patterns, which require an in depth understanding of OOP & other basics or much of what these are doing will not make sense.\n\navoid leet code.  Its like tricky word problems in a math class more than practical programming.   It can be fun, but in real life, no one will actively try to confuse you with the requirements and if they do, you can ask questions.  Hit it up SOME, but don't \"grind\" it.  The most useful thing it will teach you is how unexpected inputs and edge cases can really mess up something you thought you had working.  THAT is useful and practical!",

I've seen people who want to learn a new programming language, and a new web framework, and work on some project they have no idea how to get started. They don't budget the time it takes to learn all of that. They justify it by saying they'll learn new things, but have no contingency if they run out of time.\n\nMy suggestion is to find out who has more experience, your friend with React or you with Angular or if one of you can pick stuff up quickly. Or do both. Plan out a rough idea of what needs to get done, and how it would be done with Angular and React.\n\nIn the meanwhile, give yourself about a week or two to learn Django (or use Flask, which is allegedly lighter weight and might be easier to learn). Build out a super simple web app (to-do) just to see the steps needed. If you're still mired in Django and Flask after two weeks and realize it's too much to learn, then go back to the technology you already know.\n\nIf you can start learning Django and Flash right now, you can see how fast you can learn it. I would suggest regular meetings (every day) and perhaps in person if you can manage it during this process. Essentially, you are waiting for a go or no go scenario (go meaning yes, do it in Django/Flask, and no go meaning go back to something familiar).",

For example, a RESTful API endpoint is best written as just a standalone procedure rather than being a class method, since the API is inherently stateless and thus there is no state to encapsulate.

As you go past the halfway point, the 'return 7' becomes the most likely until you reach 100% at which 'return 7' happens 100% of the time. \n\nI almost think of it like holding a cylinder full of liquid on its side and tilting it to one side or the other. If the cylinder is flat, the liquid is evenly distributed, if it's tilted slightly it begins accumulating on one side, more with a greater angle. \n\nMy thinking was that it was an 8 bit value being compared to give a finer granularity in determining the greater than or less than values.\n\nIn practical application it's for a self-generating musical sequencer, like an algorithmic player piano, to determine the length of a musical step (analogous to how long a piano key is held down). If you turn the knob all the way to the left, the musical notes generated by the sequencer will only be one musical step long. If it's all the way to the right, it will only generate 8-step-long notes. If it's a quarter of the way, it will produce mostly one step notes, with some two step notes, less three step notes, even less four step notes, etc. \n\nHope that makes sense!",

        "body": "I really admire that you're diving into HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python at 54—your passion and diverse background are definite strengths. That said, I want to be as candid as possible:\n\nFreelancing in programming typically comes after years of experience in the industry. While there's no formal barrier to entry beyond setting up a profile on a freelancing platform, this low threshold means you're competing against a vast pool of skilled coders—many with years of experience, advanced degrees, and robust portfolios filled with positive client reviews. Back in the mid-2010s, there was a surplus of tech needs, and companies were more willing to take on individuals with bootcamp training or certifications in lieu of real experience because the talent pool was scarce. In today's market, the situation has reversed—tech is high-paying and attractive, leading to a surplus of highly experienced, often laid-off programmers. Most companies have their pick of talent, whether hiring full-time employees or freelancers, so they have little incentive to take a chance on entry-level coders or invest time and money into training someone without a proven track record. It's not impossible by any means, but it will take several people willing to \"give you a chance.\" Until you build up those client experience reviews, finding freelance gigs will be especially challenging. It's the classic chicken-and-egg scenario: you need a job to gain experience, but you need experience to get the job.\n\nThe alternative—landing an entry-level programmer role remotely—is almost completely out of the picture. Remote positions nowadays are typically reserved for those who already have a strong background because the market for remote roles is fiercely competitive. The COVID era, where remote work was the norm, is rapidly fading; everyone wants to work from home, but few get to. In many parts of the world, especially in regions like the U.S. (at least where I'm writing), remote experienced freelance or full-time programmers are still a thing—but entry-level remote roles are virtually non-existent. Even on-site roles face fierce competition. I'm not sure how things shake out in places like Albania or wider Europe, but the trend is similar: only highly experienced folks, often bolstered by a flood of laid-off talent, get those remote opportunities.\n\nOn top of that, generative AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are changing the game. These tools can handle many of the routine tasks that junior developers used to do—completing boilerplate code and similar work much faster than a human. As a result, the real value in programming today isn't just about writing code; it's about leveraging it to solve complex, real-world problems. The true edge lies in depth and creativity, where your ability to draw on years of industry-specific experience can help you harness generative AI efficiently—something AI by itself can't do. This shift leaves even less room for entry-level programmers, as companies lean on the efficiency of AI and the expertise of veterans.\n\nMy advice? Keep learning the basics and enjoy the process, but once you have a solid foundation, jump into advanced tools like Google Gemini Canvas. This isn't just about using fancy new software—it's a reality check that shows how far generative AI has come and how it can outperform entry-level folks on routine tasks. It also reminds you that real value comes from using code to solve meaningful problems, something that only someone with experience and creative problem-solving skills can do. In other words, don't just aim to be a freelance coder; consider positioning yourself as a consultant who can merge your decades of industry expertise with your growing tech skills to solve niche, real-world challenges.\n\nBottom line: You haven't missed the boat yet, but today's boat is more like a high-speed ferry crammed with highly experienced, AI-enhanced pros. Your journey will be challenging, but by being realistic and strategic—focusing on niche projects, learning the basics, and quickly adopting advanced AI tools—you can carve out your own path in this highly competitive, ever-changing market.\n\nGood luck, and keep enjoying the learning process!",

Split a complex problem into multiple simple ones if you can. \n\nDon’t optimize unnecessarily. If a function doesn’t need to be fast, a simple, slow solution is fine. \n\nEach file in your project should be able to be read and understood by itself. Ideally no files should exceed 2000 lines and a competent developer should be able to read and understand the file within 1 hour. After reading the file they should understand what functionality the file provides, what libraries and other files the file depends on, how often the file’s functions are expected to be called (once an hour vs 1000 times a second), and be confident that the file doesn’t have bugs. \n\nYour code should be able to be read from top to bottom. A reader ideally should not have to jump around a file, or jump between multiple files for things to make sense. \n\nUse functions to eliminate/reduce similar code blocks. \n\nInline most single use functions. \n\nUse single line functions sparingly. \n\nReduce the amount of useless information that the reader has to see. Example: if a class’s field is the same 99% of the time, use a default value for the field in the __init__ function. If you pass that field in every time, you’ll waste space and you’ll make the more important set fields less visible. \n\nUse white space to separate code blocks. Too much white space can be a bad thing. \n\nIdeally a function should fit on one screen, so the reader doesn’t have to scroll up if they need to look back at a line. \n\nCode is great when it looks so simple and obvious that most readers would assume that it was easy to write.",

The module name here can also change and you could have different ones for different things so you should check the documentation of that module to see what to call and use for your purpose.",

Otherwise I suggest you look for more gentler intros and use the book as a supplement or to improve your knowledge and rigour as you get more advanced.",

Some of the introductory stuff is kind of okay, but it goes very fast, and takes huge strides through binary search, insertion sort and merge sort, to use as a basis for further, more advanced algorithms. Which I think is a mistake, because it is the simple things that are hardest to understand - once you get them though, it is fairly easy to understand the many different complex algorithms that the book goes through.\n\nHonestly, I'd suggest something like Grokking Algorithms to read to understand the basic principles, and then use Wikipedia articles for each algorithm that you have to study - often they quote CLRS, but add additional explanations or pseudocode.\n\nCheck if your library has the book, and read some of the chapters in the syllabus - if you like their style of writing, by all means buy the book, if not, see if you can do without.",

So that might be: \n\n\\- An interactive website\n\n\\- It has a dashboard that does x\n\n\\- Users can log into it and have views attached to their accounts\n\n\\- I must pull data from y source to show in the dashboard\n\n  \nAnd then you can start your project. But with a clear view that you are going to use it more as a roadmap for learning. Each time you hit a block as to how to get the next bit done that is what can guide you to head off and learn how to do something of that kind.\n\nSo first of all, it may be a simple question of 'what kind of code would I even need to make this dashboard page' which means you now have your question, and a focused thing to investigate and learn. You'll head off, figure out that you're going to need to create an HTML page, and style it with some CSS. You can learn the basics of those, and practice how to do it. Then you can come back and put that into your project.\n\nThe downside is you will need to re-do things a LOT. Because chances are the choices you make early on will be sub optimal. But if you do it this way I think it can offer a sensible means of helping you focus your learning. I did something quite similar with a stock controller application for my work when I was learning, and it worked ok.",

I don't know flutter, but I generally learn most from (quality, highly regarded) books, IMHO they have the best return on investment, tho with libraries like flutter, they would get outdated rather quickly I suppose.",

        "body": "To understand a reference documentation you need to **understand the concepts** it references first. \n\nOnce you do that, make sure you understand every paragraph. Do not take shortcuts (in the beginning). Actively compare your expectations with what you read. Does it really say what you expect/want it to say?\n\nReading documentation is a very active and hard process. I constantly check what I read against my expectations. It shows more unknowns: some I move away for later (🤔), others I keep on a stack to be resolved while reading on.\n\nI have no idea what flutter does and just checked some API reference (https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/gestures/BaseTapGestureRecognizer-class.html). Here is my thought process in reading the docs:\n\nBefore reading the first paragraph I assumed I know what a *gesture* is, and what a *tap* is.\n\nI soon recognised the *abstract* keyword, which told me to expect subclasses or even write subclasses to actually recognise a tap. I remembered to look for subclasses later.\n\nI read about a *arena*, and picture of fighting recognisers came to my mind. Maybe that is a model flutter used to decide which expected gesture best matches the recorded events my fingers do? Let’s look for more information.\n\nThere is something like a GestureArenaManager. Ok.\n\nWhat then is described matches my expectations on a tap. I was surprised to read about a button. Can I only tap buttons? What if I have a canvas to paint on or something? For now imagine a button that I can drag or tap. I expect to recognisers to fight it out in the arena.\n\nThe pointer concept in the next paragraph escaped me: maybe this down-1 down-2 refers to two fingers which touch? Is down-2 completely ignored? What is down-1 is on the button, but down-2 is not? 🤔\n\nThe next paragraph confirms that the class is abstract. *isPointerAllowed* does not make too much sense to me. The pointer concept is still weird. But the paragraph gives some indication how a gesture might be linked to a button: Subclassing has something to do with it.\n\nAha: a ready made, therefore less variable, therefore easier to understand *TabGestureRecognicer* does exist. Maybe I will have a look at it to better understand the concepts. Also this answers one part of the questions I stacked earlier: which subclasses to exist. My interpretation of *abstract* and *Base* are confirmed.    \nI do wonder: “tabs *of* the primary button”? I expected *on* the primary button! I thought of a button as a screen widget. Maybe it is something on a controller (remember: I still have no idea what flutter is)?\n\nI ignore ModalBarrier and inheritance for now.\n\nI move on to the constructor: Oh! What is a debugOwner? Must be a fancy flutter concept. Why do I set supportedDevices? What are devices? I need to learn more about flutter concepts. I need more context. Let’s read on, maybe I do not need to fully understand the constructor. I might back down to the simple TabGestureRecognizer.\n\nAllowedButtonsFilter refers back to scroll click. So Buttons are probably screen widgets and not controller elements. But why allow some and not others? Weird.\n\nDeadline: Ah that makes sense again: if it take too long to tap you loose and are out of the arena.\n\nDebugDescription is probably just a nice debug meta concepts. Like string conversion of Object in Java.\n\nDebugOwner is the recognizer’s owner. Weird: Is *ownership* just for debugging in flutter? Usually Ownership is an important concept to build hieraries and split responsibilities. 🤔\n\nGoing on …\n\nPrimaryPointer: the pointer this one is tracking: ok my assumptions about one or two pointers (Fingers?) with Down-1 and Down-2 from above might be correct: Down-2 is from another pointer that gets ignored.\n\nTeam: what is that???\n\nNow lots of methods what check and set lots of more or less expected or unknown stuff. \n\nI stop again at *getKindOfPointer*. What might different kinds of pointers be? I expect (before I click and read on) fingers and mouse pointers. I check on *PointerDeviceKind*: Touch, Mouse, Stylus, etc. my expectation is met.\n\nI thought the handle… methods to be called so an action can take place like a callback, but instead they make the recognizer handle events to do its own thing. \n\nInvokeCallback: it especially mentions exceptions: is to *just* handle exceptions? 🤔\n\nOk more methods ….\n\nIf I now like to know more, I would read on the subclass and look for some code which uses it. Maybe debug to further reject or support my current(!) understanding.\n\nNever trust your understanding :)",

They'll be hiring a replacement as soon as they can.\n\nBeing *laid off* means the company is eliminating your position, probably alongside a ton of others, because either they literally can't afford you, or they're making some big, strategic decision about where they want to invest.

Boundaries are non-negotiable. I explicitly communicate when I'm unavailable and stick to it. My team adapted once they saw I was serious.\n\n2. Documentation as self-defense. I started obsessively documenting everything I learn and build. If others can understand the problem, they can solve it. \n\n3. Finding the right team culture matters more than the paycheck. Search for jobs that respect work life balance. A service like Applyre might be helpful here. I took a slight pay cut for a team that genuinely respects work-life balance.\n\nTech doesn't have to be a trap. The industry has problems, but with the right boundaries and environment, it can still offer the flexibility and challenge that attracted us in the first place. Finding that balance took me years, but it's possible.",

It isn't easy becoming a great software engineer and it isn't easy maintaining your edge by keeping your knowledge up to date.  It changes far faster than literally any other field in the world.  Being always on edge is a problem.  You need to learn to detach yourself a bit if that's how you feel 24/7.  You sound burnt out.  It's critical you learn to handle this cause it'll keep happening if you don't.\n\n1) Meditation, do it 30 minutes a day every single day.  Unplug, turn off your phone, no computer alerts, no tv, just meditate for 30 minutes every day.  Look up some videos how to if you don't know yet.\n\n2) Go into nature at least 1 day a week ideally but if you can take a walk in nature multiple days a week that's even better.\n\n3) You shouldn't be on-call all the time, there should be a rotation at the company.  If there isn't an on-call rotation, find another company cause the one you're in is toxic and unhealthy or if you have some seniority implement an on-call rotation and refuse to be available when it's not your day/week.\n\nThese are the strategies I use to manage it.  Also, therapy and anxiety medication can help.  Best of luck.",

Are you trying to get them to understand that you may not be able to achieve the goals set for the team? Are you trying to get help? Are you just venting?\n\nYour manager asked you to help fix the team. That means she’s probably already aware something is wrong with them and is looking for you to help come up with solutions or at least help identify what they’re doing wrong. If you need extra resources or to change the roadmap or need her to back you up on process changes, my guess is that’s all on the table, but she’s looking for your guidance and some semblance of a plan. Going back to her and just saying “this team sucks” isn’t helpful to anyone.\n\nIf I was your manager and you came back to me and said, “The team is broken and I can’t fix it. Please move me because I don’t want this on my resume.” I’d honestly be pretty pissed and it would impact our relationship. I’m looking for your help with a problem at your current job and you’re telling me no because you’re worried about your next job. If you came to me and said, “Here are the problems I see. I think we need to focus on fixing this tech debt for a while which should allow us to deliver faster in the future. If we can get one more engineer on the team I think that would help too.” That would be much more well received even if I couldn’t make that happen.\n\nVenting to your manager a little bit is fine, but most of the time if you’re bringing a problem to your manager you should also bring at least one suggestion of how to solve it. If the problem is something that they’ve explicitly asked you to help fix then having some ideas on how to fix this is almost mandatory. You can almost always bring problems to your manager as long as you frame it in a way where you’re trying to be part of a solution.",

Meetings will be called. Escalations will be fielded. Huge amounts of time will be wasted.\n\nIdeally you don’t need to build in 5x padding to deliver on time. But sometimes you do.",

I entered CS off the tail end of a failed academic career, so I've had a very strong toolkit for working on ambiguous problems and teaching myself things, plus I spent several years in my PhD learning how to program and math/stats.  Academic trainng is extremely just super helpful for any knowledge work job\n\nOther than be extremely good at what you're currently doing, having a natural interest in CS, and trying out random things all the time, is a huge benefit. For the last decade plus of my career I've really just followed the oppurtunity, and each step was just a different role in the process of building web applications. So I have done several different roles, but taking a step back, my skillset is unified under a broad \"develop web technologies in emerging domains\".  \n  \nThat said, for every transition, I've always narrowed in on one thing I want to do, and just apply to jobs of those types. Like my last job I was a team lead of an infrastructure team, and didn't really like that, so I decided my next job would be some sort of product engineering. That got me in to a big tech company, and now I get paid enough to just focus on leading a team, and besides a reading group and some side projects, I don't really stress about keeping my skills up.",

I had nothing to lose so you can do that sometimes. \n\n2nd interview - COO is involved.. Very open honest discussion, great discussion. Dude knew I achieved what I wanted in EHS, looking for an opportunity into business side (non-ehs), was bored, etc. \n\nHe tells me I am overqualified and that I am better than Safety. While some may have gotten offended, I did not because I agree lol. Nothing against my EHS brothers/sisters.. I just have always been bored and found it not challenging enough (I am director level currently). He was just spot on with everything and we were just starting to converse.. At this point, my interviews are not your typical \"give me a time you had to use decision making in a high-stress situation\" but more conversational, management style, personality assessing, etc.  At least in my experience the last 2 job changes. \n\nI get rejected, but while being rejected for role I interviewed for, they tell me there is another opportunity that they would love to discuss with me if still interested. I checked their website to see what jobs were listed, and it was only a handful and none of them would match any I would fill. I believe the COO I connected with is throwing me a lifeline for a career change. They know how much I currently make and that I would not take less (3 small kids, wife to support), but he must have seen or heard something that caused him to throw me a potential bone and transition into a new career. I am very much looking forward to learning more, but it feels good that this even happened and that my skills and abilities are easily recognized by the C-Suite in at least one company lol\n\nGreat post OP.. Glad I am not the only one going through this! I have never been in a situation like it so hoping I make the right decision.",

It's very misleading, as I joined during the beta, asked some popular/stupid questions, and got in early doors on some of the easier answers for popular stacks.\n\nThis had been called out from the start. Many suggested that to follow Jeff Atwood's initial vision for SO the site would need to reduce duplication not through closing, but through merging content, and producing canonical content across multiple questions. These problems had dragged on for over a decade, and ultimately SO never learned from them. They focused more on power users over the overall vision.\n\nAlongside this, internal changes mean that Jeff left, eventually Joel left (IIRC?), the dev days died, and the reputation the site had kept dying out.\n\nI don't think it'll die, but it needs very strong leadership to become relevant again.",

Robotics that can stand in one spot plugged into a wall and do the same thing over and over like on an assembly line, sure, but the power usage and overheating problems need to be worked out for autonomous units.  And they need to do something about LLMs confidently giving you the wrong answer before anyone will trust them.\n\nBut let’s say they iron out all the kinks; I’ve heard upwards of 60-70% of jobs could be replaced.  Our systems are not setup to handle such massive unemployment.  All these giant tech firms are not going to give up their earnings to contribute to any form of UBI, the line must go up!  There are too few politicians that aren’t bought and paid for that will actually stand up and do something.  \n\nIn the long run this is all just another big tech bait-n-switch.  They can run at giant losses for years, maybe even decades as they continue to subsidize everything with the parts of the business that make money.  They will sell a restaurant a waiter bot with the latest wAIter model installed, but it can only stand at the hostess podium, and tries to seat people at already occupied tables 30% of the time.  Human Robotics promises it will replace your entire wait staff in 5 years so a few people lose their jobs.  But turns out the wAIter model was just a chatGPT wrapper making API calls the entire time. Human Robotics is running out of seed money, so now before the robot will seat your customers they must watch a 30 second unskipable ad for the McDonalds across the street.\n\nIt just seems like if everything works out the way the big tech companies want it’s the worst possible outcome for humanity.",

You could be in any career, in any field, in any position and still get laid off. This is just the way of the world.\n\nWith your YoE, you should be getting messages from recruiters on LinkedIn and other platforms that can easily land you interviews. Try premium for a month, spruce up your LinkedIn and add all the common skills you see across the job descriptions you are interested in. Even if you don’t have the skills, read up on docs and just get a basic understanding so that you can speak to it during interviews. Add those skills to your LinkedIn and Resume, I guarantee your profile starts getting hits from recruiters. Talk to the ones who supply Job Descriptions you’d actually consider taking. This is genuine advice that worked for me. I found a position after about a month and a half with 7 YoE (NYC area) which is really the same as 5 in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI’m sick of hearing people cry that CS careers are over. There will literally always be a need for SWEs. If you think AI will replace us, then you clearly haven’t used AI very much yet. It fucks up a LOT, and is really more of a tool than a replacement for people.\n\nThe job market will eventually recover and you will be able to get a good job with good pay. Stop dick riding FAANG as well. FAANG is what made the market what it is because they over hired and over paid for people and set unrealistic expectations for what SWE careers should actually look like. They set a standard for unrealistic hiring practices that is not reflective of actual work we do on a daily basis. We’re grinding LC for months just to do a job where we do basic system design and basic logic. It’s absolutely ridiculous.\n\nAlso, FAANG looks good on resumes, sure, but so does experience in any real job where you can back up that experience with technical knowledge. If someone is gonna hire you just because your resume says FAANG, then they’re an idiot and you probably shouldn’t work for them anyway.\n\nLower your salary expectations a bit, you have to realize that you’re in competition with a ton of other people who were laid off and are all expecting to make more money than what they were making than when they were laid off. It’s better to have a decent paying job than no job at all.",

I responded to his comment, but he was too much of a beach to respond back to me. \n\nThere is definitely a lot of negativity online in these groups, though I have to agree, Reddit really is one big echo chamber as well. I see the same posts on here every day multiple times a day about people whining about the job market and giving up on the tech field and not getting hired. Idk. It does suck, but Reddit also feels like one big negativity echochamber.",

You roll in around 10 am and do standup. Work for an hour then lunch for an hour. You'll stand in line for 30 minutes at a food truck if you don't go before 12. At 1 you'll work for a few hours then go home. Maybe ping pong or something once a week if you have coworkers who are into that and you want to play. That's your day. Somewhere in there you'll go get your free coffee and a banana and think about working at a company that isn't so cheap.\n\nAs you get promoted, there are more and more meetings with every promotion and you get involved in all kinds of random email/slack threads but you're also expected to get as much coding done as the L4s.\n\nMost everything depends on your team and manager. Your manager has a very large role in your happiness and how horrible your deadlines are and your team will make it fun + help you... or they won't and you'll cry yourself to sleep because you can't figure anything out. Difficult to tell you if it will be good or not.\n\nYou should pick waymo tbh. Amazon's mandatory firing bucket and current layoff outlook has had a corrosive effect on the culture and if you have a good option, you should go there.",

Feeling out of your depth sometimes just means you're growing.  \n  \nThat said, it’s also okay to want something a little different.

There's not going to be a college course for every new thing.\n\n>How do professionals in the field learn this stuff and develop expertise?\n\nSame as everything else.\n\nWe read documentation, books, papers, articles, existing sample code, and, most importantly: we *write* code, see how it works, fix it when it doesn't, and learn from it.\n\nThere's very little structure in software engineering and it's really up to you to make the most of what's available.\n\nGood luck!",

Anyone can pick that stuff up, junior or senior, and it doesn't increase your value as an engineer on its own.\n\nYour value as an engineer comes from your ability to solve hard, impactful problems of increasing scope, complexity, and ambiguity. \n\nScope has to do with how large a task is and how long it takes. Junior engineers work on small tasks that only take a few days or weeks. Senior engineers work on large multi-month deliverables.\n\nComplexity has to do with how tricky the actual task is. I work in video streaming. A junior engineer might work on something like \"fix this tiny bug in the encoding module.\" A senior engineer might work on something like \"design and implement a scalable transcoding pipeline for <x> use case.\"\n\nAmbiguity has to do with how well-defined the task is. A junior engineer would work on something that's really obvious, clear, and requires very little clarification. A senior engineer might be given a vague problem statement like \"our video transcode pipeline is too slow. Go fix it.\" or \"We need <x> feature, figure it out.\", and the onus is on them to dissect that request into actionable, concrete technical tasks for the team to work on.\n\nThe more you focus on these three things, the better an engineer you become.\n\nRead [DropBox's technical career guide.](https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/ic1_software_engineer.html) It goes into even more detail than this, at all levels from junior to director.\n\nNote that *nothing* in the guide mentions *any* of the things in your post. None of that is relevant to your growth as an engineer beyond picking things up as needed so that you can accomplish what your job requires of you.",

I can't break it down year by year.\n\nLearn new software on the job and maybe get your employer to pay for an entry level AWS or Azure or GCP cert. Docker and Kubernetes are good to pickup but you can't realistically learn 5 things at once or in one year. Don't overdo it. I was forced to use Python on the job when our team inherited a codebase in it. What's more important is you used these things on the job. Experience trumps everything.\n\nAlso depends greatly on what you're assigned to. Like frontend, middleware or backend or the industry such as government or banking. There's no one common path. There was one job if I got I would have had to use TypeScript with NestJS. I was willing to do it.\n\nEventually you can start piecing together full designs and you'll get design questions at tech lead level, maybe earlier. I'm talking full application with database and web server with your choice of tech stack and programming language(s). I remember saying once in a job I got that we can't just use the new, shiniest thing. We're better with X software that we can hire people with some years of experience and not have to train them.",

That probably doesn't help you right now at the moment you need a job, but medium/long term, I would definitely look at lateral moves to other functions.  I think being early in your career actually helps you here because you'll be on the junior side for whatever you do.  Do some dev work in your spare time if that interests you at all.  Actually, even if it doesn't interest you, it's probably a good idea.\n\nThere are two kinds of SDET jobs I see these days:\n\nOne, what we used to call \"white box\" - someone who has dev-level skills and has written source code or close to it.  These people can stand up a test framework from scratch and pipeline infrastructure for tests to run and report.  These have a little more staying power and tend to have the opportunity to become other kinds of software engineering roles - devs, devops, release eng, etc. - when the business outgrows the need for dedicated QA.\n\nTwo, jobs that are basically QA and mostly manual testing, but for companies that know they need to step up their testing game and need a stopgap while they either scale up their automated CI/CD efforts or offshore manual efforts.  You can tell by the way I've described it that I don't think these roles have a bright future, but you might get to hang on for a while at a company that's struggling through that process.\n\nObservability, monitoring, and deployment tools have come a long way in reducing risk in software delivery since I started my career.  Issues can be seen early and fixed quickly.  Unit tests are fast and cover a lot of ground.  There's still some use for end to end testing, but I see a drastically reduced need to have a specialized function for it that introduces additional process and the overhead of handing work off to different people along the way.",

The easiest way to cure this is to have a candid conversation with your manager, and see if they can either find you some different work, or transfer you onto a different team.\n\nDoing that usually reignites the spark for me. The longest I've lasted at one company is a little over 5 years, and the main reason I lasted that long was I switched teams after 3 years. Switching teams gave me a ton of new stuff to learn, it was in an entirely different tech stack, I had to learn all the business knowledge from scratch. It's fun, everything's new again. It's shoving you back into the \"honeymoon stage\".\n\nMy new grad company was actually great with this. They *encouraged* internal moves at the 2 year mark for all employees. For me specifically it just sorta happened naturally, I worked on 3 different teams across 3.5 years. The only reason I left them was because I wanted to live on the east coast, otherwise I could've stayed there for life. And some of my friends have, I think there's 5 or so people from my new grad cohort that are still at that company, 12 years later.\n\nSo that's what I'd recommend. See if you can transfer internally, or get a completely new type of work. If you can't, start looking for a new job .See if that fixes things for you. If it doesn't, then maybe you're right, this industry just isn't a good fit for you... but the fact you found your job rewarding *at first* makes me think you're just bored rather than being burnt out of the entire industry.",

As always with the US, the social services are lacking compared to Europe, though if you get a high paying job with great benefits, that difference is mostly mitigated\n2. Education in the Boston area is excellent, rivaling the Nordic countries\n3. Public transit is acceptable but easily the worst out of the 3 cities you’re considering, bike infrastructure kind of sucks, but the city itself is supremely walkable\n4. Boston is not a late night city, restaurants and bars often close quite early compared to other similar cities\n5. Most of the neighborhoods in Boston feel meaningfully distinct from one another, it’s something I love about the city but you should definitely shop around for a neighborhood you like before deciding where to live\n6. Food is good, not great for a city of its size - beer scene is arguably the best in the country though\n7. Quick access to New York via Amtrak is awesome\n8. As you noted, Boston is probably the safest major American city and rivals many European cities\n9. No shade, and I’m obviously biased, but I really prefer New Englanders to other Americans and Northern Europeans. I feel New Englanders are the perfect mix of being pretty friendly and kind without being obnoxious or fake about it\n10. Speaking of which, New England itself is awesome. Great vacation or long weekend opportunities all over the place for all seasons\n11. Boston is easily the coldest and hottest/most humid of the cities you’re considering, but it also gets the most sunlight. I prefer Boston winters to Berlin winters even though Berlin doesn’t get as cold\n12. The rental and buying market in Boston sucks, but I’m not sure it’s better in the other cities you’re considering\n13. Boston is absolutely the most “European-feeling” of the major American cities, but it’s still definitely an American city at its core.",

I would focus on one or two, have them hosted so their viewable by the employer and be able to talk through them.

You can apply for analyst positions right now but you’re probably better off going for help desk unless you’ve done a security focused internship.

Ain't no way you're seriously negotiating 50% more without expecting them to just rescind. And the reasonable-ness is relative to the *offer*, not the market. Even if they offer you 50% below market, asking for 50% more is not going to fly.\n\nThat said, even though the risk of the offer being rescinded over reasonable negotiation is very low, it's still non-zero. There is still always a chance of the company going beyond playing hardball, and just fully rescinding. It happens. Not often, but it absolutely happens.\n\nSo the question becomes, are you willing to take that non-zero (but close to zero) risk to get some more money? If so, negotiate. If not, don't.

On average, it just feels like a normal job. Maybe don't apply if you're just barely meeting the requirements, but if you comfortably meet the bar it's not a bad place to work (not a particularly amazing one either, but the pay is pretty high).\n\nThat said, the quality of your manager and skip manager are matter a lot. If you get bad ones I would start looking to swap teams ASAP. All those stories you hear about the PIP factory and similar, they mostly if not entirely come from bad managers.\n\n> Does working there open up opportunities at other FAANG companies, specifically Apple? \n\nYes, assuming you don't already have FAANG experience on your resume, and you stay for at least a couple years.\n\n> Also, is it possible to relocate from AWS Ireland to the offices in the U.S.?\n\nYes, but you'd have to switch teams (which involves talking to a hiring manager and potentially going through an interview loop). This will be a lot harder if you need Visa/Citizenship assistance.\n\n> By the way, do they work from the office or in a hybrid model? I’ve read that AWS plans to return to the office in 2025—do you know if that’s actually happening?\n\nFor SDE positions (at least here in the US) it's 5 days RTO and pretty actively enforced. Some orgs are more lenient, but expect to spend at least 4 days in the office if not 5. This is, in my opinion, the biggest downside about working for Amazon - I think whenever I move on to my next role I'm going to look for at least a hybrid if not full remote position.",

You can also learn most popular languages pretty easily if you understand C# well. Most software engineers change languages as frequently as they change jobs.\n\nLearning some JS, Ruby, or Python might help, as those are three extremely common languages on the backend.\n\nIf you specifically want to build custom tools used internally (not client-facing), there are a ton of those jobs. These days web tools are probably more common than desktop programs, but in some industries the latter is probably still common. \n\nIt might be hard to seek out “internal tools” jobs, because some of those roles involve building things for the core client-facing product as well.

Knowing how parts of a system work together is something you’ve already done, you just have to abstract that to other types of systems.  \n\n2. What type of system design question you’ll be asked will vary greatly on the scale of the company, the seniority of role, and the type of roll. You should not expect load balancing questions if you’re doing a front end engineering system design interview. If you’re doing backend at an established company, they probably won’t be asking about load balancing (because they’ve already solved that), but will probably ask about problems you’ll be expected to solve. \n\n3. Unless you’re doing system design or architecture or tooling, they probably will just want to know that you can think in terms of systems. The specific database or asynchronous job or whatever other part won’t matter so long as you know how they interact or at a higher level what pieces are interacting. They care most that you’re able to grasp the whole system rather than that you remember the names of specific tools to build the system (unless they specifically list technology they use, then you should totally know about those technologies at a conversational level).\n\n4. ChatGPT is a great tool to prep for interviews. You can prompt it to create a series of questions for you for the seniority level and type of roll  and company and interview type (systems design) you’re interviewing for. If you have the job description/company, that can help it be more specific. You can ask it to give you feedback or to help you fill in gaps in your understanding.",

Find some people who are willing to chat and get you up to speed - there might be meetups in your city, or you can use LinkedIn to set up chats. I know networking is not super comfortable for a lot of people, so I'm happy to chat in DMs to help you start.",

There were live lectures each week and then breakout sessions each week where you work with small groups to build the skills. It’s a lot more engaging and fun than trying to learn it alone.\n\nAt the end you get a certificate, but obviously those don’t really hold much weight with employers. The main benefit is the skills you learn (and I assume that in Web 101, you’ll build some pretty cool projects).\n\nAnd all of their courses are 100% free, so, yes I’d absolutely recommend it.",
