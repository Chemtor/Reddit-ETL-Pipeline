No PRs should be accepted unless the owner of the data (preferably a senior/experienced dev) approves it.\n* Idempotency, idempotency, idempotency. Probably the most crucial part of any data warehouse pipeline. It is really not that hard to implement these days (most modern pipelines and warehouses have multiple ways to enforce it). Prevents 95%+ of data inconsistency issues in production.\n* Backwards/forwards compatible transfer protocol. My current favorite is Protobuf (or proto-adjacent forks) for its 'data-contract'-iness behavior, but Avro + schema registry works too (though I personally hate having to manage yet one more cog in the flow)\n* Monorepo your schemas. Slightly controversial take, but this helps definitions/migrations fail at *compilation time*, which in my experience reduces runtime problems by orders of magnitude.\n* Pick a database that can be locally initialized via a container, and keep an append-only log of all migrations in git. This makes testing so much more reproducible, and makes it quite rare to have unexpected issues in production you didn't find at the test phase.\n\nIn my experience following most/all of these makes everything else follow naturally in place.",

A former US employer had dabbled in Palantir then moved away from it quite rapidly once they understood what they were getting into.\n\nHere's a link to some more information about the NHS Federated Data Platform, that gives some insight into what exactly it is from a technical perspective. https://www.england.nhs.uk/digitaltechnology/nhs-federated-data-platform/how-does-the-nhs-federated-data-platform-work/\n\nMy main reaction is that lock in is nothing new for the NHS. It's obviously not ideal, but equally, NHS trusts and the central NHS bodies are very used to fighting their way out from locked-in information systems. And when you're one of the ten largest employers in the world, you do have a fair bit of clout for getting past lock in. \n\nI can't speak to whether Foundry is a good choice here technically speaking, but IF it is, it's probably better for the NHS to have a good technical solution with lock in, than a worse technical solution without lock in.",

They can continue to work as normal if you don't \"drop in\".\n\n4) We've also had similar success with \"co-working\" hours a couple times a week which is just a zoom that anyone can drop into and chat or just sit and work but be available for others to ping.

Let the schema evolve by versioning (`event_version`) instead of spawning new tables.\n* Columnar stores/lakes are built for this. Partition by date/hour; cluster/z-order by `event_name`, `user_id` (and optionally `session_id`). Only break out separate tables for dimensional models or specific serving use-cases (e.g., a narrow “page\\_views” mart), not for raw ingestion.\n* Identity & causality: require source-side IDs. Minimum viable set: `event_id` (UUID), `user_id` (or `user_pseudo_id`), `device_id`, `session_id`, and a `trace_id`/`parent_event_id` for linking (think W3C Trace Context / OpenTelemetry). If long-lived cookies aren’t allowed, do deterministic or probabilistic sessionization early in the pipeline (sliding time windows, inactivity thresholds). Also emit join keys for common patterns (e.g., `impression_id` on view + `click` carries that id).\n* At your scale (hundreds of millions/day): append-only raw, dedupe on `(event_id)`; compact small files; enforce a schema registry; backfill via streaming + incremental merge; materialize derived marts for sessions, funnels, and attribution. This avoids N-way unions at read time.\n* Trade-offs: you can’t max scalability, usability, and simplicity simultaneously. Declare priorities and the costs you accept (e.g., “optimize analytical latency and cost; accept slightly higher model complexity”).",

All all composed services are generic, too)\n- Tests tests tests (including generic ones that iterate possible permutations)\n- CI to enforce said tests (e.g., somebody changes the protobuf and introduces an incompatible type, fail their build and have them talk to you)\n- Naturally, a scalable database to back this - Iceberg has been treating us well, but I'm also a big fan of Clickhouse, which can do some of the aggregation for you\n\nThis is a bit outdated but also has some details on what I did: https://ngrok.com/blog-post/how-we-built-ngroks-data-platform#scaling-apache-flink-scala-and-protobuf-to-650-gbday \n\nWe don't do any pre-aggregation on purpose, but I suppose you could do that if you wanted to.\n\nfwiw you might want to solve #2 first and might even consider a vendor product for it.",

Most queries won't filter by event type. I guess if you're organizing it in a bucket it should follow hierarchy: platform -> date (yyyy-mm-dd) -> event type since most queries will probably be filtering by date and platform.

You get to see a successful production implementation and understand what it takes to maintain one\n* On-prem isn't sexy, but the tooling otherwise seems pretty modern\n* WLB matters a lot to most people's long-term careers. You have to be disciplined about \"coasting,\" but most of us need to spend time operating well below capacity to avoid burnout\n* Data teams functioning as support can struggle for visibility, which means career opportunities can be limited\n\nStartup thoughts:\n\n* Product data roles are relatively rare. I've turned down a few product-based roles and work with product engineers. My impression is that your incentives are very different from internal-facing work\n* It's probably going to be sink-or-swim. They wouldn't have extended an offer if they didn't think you could hack it, but if you like more support, it's probably not a good fit\n* There's likely very little structure around teams, advancement, and growth. It's very common for everyone to believe in \"the mission,\" and your major target is less about titles and salary and more about driving the company to IPO / acquisition, so your equity is worth something\n* If you actually get to work on streaming / near-realtime, that experience is very valuable to a smaller number of employers. Data warehousing / batch processing is much more widely applicable\n\nHow I'd think about the decision:\n\n* Are you OK with being tossed in the deep end and figuring things out? That's likely the expectation at the startup\n* Are you comfortable with more than just doing heads-down work? Startups generally require you to be more cross-functional / collaborative since you may not have mature processes (product management, team leads, etc.)\n* Are you capable of managing burnout? This can be a problem at both places, but your manager at the corpo probably has more experience identifying and heading it off (lowering workload, encouraging vacation / holiday, etc.)\n* Is working on the latest tech really important to you? If it is, the startup is a no brainer. If you're OK with learning more enduring patterns on an older stack, this is less of a differentiating factor",

I get why Company A feels safe—it’s stable, has nice people, and you’d be in a predictable environment—but if your goal is long-term career growth and building skills that transfer globally, B is where it’s at.\n\nHere’s why:\n\n1. **Modern, cloud-native stack:** Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift + Spark + Python/Scala + real-time streaming is what the market is moving toward. Hadoop/Spark/Hive experience is still okay, but it’s much more “legacy enterprise” skillset. If you want options in NA or EU in a few years, cloud-native experience will open way more doors.\n2. **Customer-facing product experience:** Working on something that thousands of companies actually use is huge. It shows you can handle scale, real-time systems, and impact—stuff recruiters notice. Internal ETL for business ops at a big company looks nice on a resume but doesn’t scream “can build product-grade systems.”\n3. **Fast-paced, growth environment:** Yes, it’s stressful and work-life balance might suck a bit, but that’s exactly where you learn the most. You’ll get exposure to data validation, lineage tracking, fraud detection pipelines—these are highly in-demand skills.\n4. **International opportunities:** The tech stack + product experience will make moving abroad far easier than internal enterprise ops work. People hiring in NA or EU will instantly recognize those skills.\n\nIf you want a chill ride and don’t care about moving internationally or building the “modern data engineer” skillset, A is fine. But for leveling up, B is the one that actually sets you up for the future.\n\nBasically: stress now → way more options later. That’s how I see it.",

Any advice?\n\nThere's already a decent response on how to deal with the immediate impact of this person mentoring you.  The other valuable bit of experience you're getting is that, first of all, you know what kind of engineer you don't want to be and second, we all have to work with difficult people sooner or later.  I think DEs early on into their career focus so much on being technical because it's tangible whilst sometimes neglecting how there are also soft skills to learn too.",

Guessing you are more open source like me. Dbt has an equivalent in pure gcp but cuts across all popular systems. A solid side project from data collection (try out dagster) to data modelling to ml models, agents, and llms is a good idea. An llm can help you find answers to questions quickly.

Like I said, I was dealing with tens of thousands of simulation files regularly on hardware that would make you cry. This volume is nothing for current systems.\n\nSecond. You'll probably have to deal with files regardless. Most simulation software (I'm assuming it's a simulation, Markov chain analysis, probably?) dumps to files, though maybe yours can dump to a db. Doesn't matter.\n\nWhat I would do is let them save everything to a bucket/blob/network drive/whatever then have your warehouse pick it up from there and stuff into a database. You can easily add the filename and other metadata during ingest and then you can serve it up to them nicely from the database. Everyone is happy.\n\nAs for executing over 30 days, that's a single Python/bash/CLI of your choice script. Since it's an optimisation problem, I'm guessing you're setting up hyper parameters for each run. You can do that with a CSV and a short script to pick up the values for each run.\n\nDon't over complicate it. This is a pretty simple exercise.",

        "body": "I've been designing DW solutions for 30 years. Up until recently, surrogate keys were always defined as int or bigint and to generate them you used a sequential number generator or similar.  This meant a couple things.  You almost always had to process your dimension before facts (because the dimension table contained the mapping of the business keys to the dw surrogate key assigned).  When processing fact tables, for every fk, you would need to lookup the associated surrogate key in the corresponding dimension table.  In the old days when we were all using OLTP based database systems like Oracle and SQL Server (on-prem because that is all we had), using integer based surrogates added in performance at query time).  Later Dan L came up with Data Vault methodolgy.  That is a very different way of modelling with one of the often listed benefits of being able to process in parallel entities that would be come dimensions from those that were facts.  To do this, he used hashing (of some sort) so that you didn't necessarily have to process data in a certain order (apologies if I have some of this wrong....I only worked on 1 DV project 14 years ago).    The other thing which occurred was columnar database solutions, the cloud and elastic and ultra scalable dbms solutions like Snowflake (and before that Terradata and Netezza).  These systems reduce/eliminate the need to worry about defining surrogate keys as integers and using a hash methodology works fine so hence, you now see many practitioners use a fixed length deterministic hash column as the surrogate.\n\nBTW:  one of the lesser known reasons for using a surrogate (based on a sequential number generator) was that you build in some isolation from the source system.  While not common, systems of record have been known to change the key of a source record (probably seldom happens now) so using a surrogate key meant that it was possible to only need to change the relationship of the dimensional business key to the existing surrogate (no need to update the FK in all related fact tables where it occurred.  By using a hash, that won't work anymore since the source key fields which might change, will result in a different hash.  But since these new systems are so much faster, probably not a big deal (I don't recall ever running into that situation but I recall Ralph Kimball mentioning this in one of his books...I think)\n\napologies for rambling on.",

There are a few advantages:\n\n* Independent processing:  You can generate foreign key without needing to do a lookup. So you could create fact records without needing to join to already loaded dimensions, or satellite and link records without joining to hubs. This allows parallel processing that isn't dependent on load order (warning: it can also lead to including a foreign key that doesn't actually exist)\n* Prevent having to do multi-column joins. For example when you have to do a diff or merge for incremental load, you can join on the hash key. \n* Records from the same source data will have the same key in all environments. This can help in some testing scenarios. \n\nThere are some disadvantages such as increasing storage of the key, risk of collisions, and being less human-readable.",

Please add or correct. \n\nAdvantages of using hash function to generate a surrogate key over creating surrogate key from sequence \n\n1. During table load into distributed system, generating sequence could become a bottleneck where as if we use hash function based on business keys, they could be loaded independently parallel much faster. \n\n2. Anonymization: Hashing protects sensitive data by creating a oneway, non reversible key. By using hash keys, you ensure that the vast majority of your data warehouse users—who are simply analyzing metrics—can't even see the sensitive data because it's not present in the tables they access. Usually dimensional tables hold sensitive info like ssn, credit card etc. \n\n3. Efficiency while doing data lookups and data integration. Use of hash keyed surrogates avoid the need for what they call pre-join. Using a sequential key requires a lookup against the dimension table to find the correct key for a given business key. But if we are using hashed surrogates, we can derive this directly from the business keys and avoid pre-join. I think what they mean is an application querying with business keys does not need to go to the dimension tables first to find the sequence number foreign key and then use that to fetch fact table details. Instead, the application querying can directly generate a hash from the business keys that the user entered and query the fact table directly. \n\n4. If data is sourced from different source systems, the hashed key approach ensures the same key will be generated for say the same customer whereas if we use sequence, that will end up creating multiple records  for the same customer causing data integrity issues.",

I think they need an entire team to be honest.\n\nOne thing that annoys me is that executive reporting drives most of our reporting work.  We need to build out full-on Kimball models because the accuracy of these reports is questioned at the microscopic level.  They get looked at for a few minutes every month and are used for strategic decisions where a few hundred dollars isn’t going to change any strategy.  Yet we must focus on those minor discrepancies.\n\nI disagree with a centralized data infrastructure team.  What I have learned is that ”Centralized” is just gatekeeping and creating a new bottleneck.\n\nDo you know what operations does when IT can’t build an app fast enough, or it takes months to build a data model and report?\n\nThey just do it all outside the authorized structure and build it in excel and create a bunch of shadow processes and tech debt and single points of failure.\n\nThe corporate dream is executive reporting then driving operational reporting.  Except that takes a long time to build, is inefficient and costly to maintain.\n\nIn reality, we should focus on the operational reporting and push all our resources into helping them be more accurate and automate as many processes there as possible.",

You can always take your  model to the cloud later if you wanted to with minimal changes.  There is not a ton of value IMO of the paid version.  \n\nA few other things to consider are that rumors are that Fivetran might be buying dbt, which could affect the future of the OSS option.  If dbt continues independently there might be more divergence from their commercial product and OSS, so features you won't have access to (but like I  said you switch later).",

This makes it very organisationally costly for analytics teams to start a successful OSS project where they need access to cybersecurity, architecture, ERP resources, it's a turf war.

Hive is 'simpler' than iceberg, which is both good and bad: **Good** because there is less involved management of the objects (no snapshots TTLs for example) and it is simpler to reason about the partitions and buckets (to some extent) but **bad** because you lack access to operations such as MERGE, DELETE, UPDATE that simplify the logic of the pipelines. In hive if you want to create a SCD2 you have to do it in more steps and always with the mindset that you have to move data to another temp or staging table in order to do a final insert with the data you want to 'update'. In iceberg you can just MERGE/UPSERT.\n\n\n2. Iceberg has more functionalities that enable you to write efficient tables and queries to access their data: z-order, bloom filters (supported to some extent in hive table format) and hidden partitions are a few of them, but now that I think about it not a lot of people used them to get the most out of the hardware. You can achieve great results while optimizing large tables if you use them in the right way (good sorting to improve compression, adding bloom filters for columns often used in equi-wheres, use the right type of merge (CoW/MoR) depending on how the data lands in the table and is queried, etc)\n\nI would prefer iceberg because of the extra functionalities to manipulate data, but without snapshots or at least a very simplified version of it.",

        "body": "This is totally simple and doable, and you can keep control of the data governance, query, construction, validation, and product all while using AI for generating reports in the app. It doesn’t sound like you’re using an API to interface the app with the database, you need to start doing that now as that’ll be your control layer.  Get rid of your CSV‘s and your one big query, that was a horrible idea to begin with. The app can still pass the client ID to the API and government governance can still be insured through whatever tool you’re using on the back end, the AI doesn’t need to know anything about your schema and you don’t have to change your ingest or schema at all.\n\nAll you have to do is teach your AI about your API, use strict templating to constraint output for pre-rolled reports, and, use a more general template and allow the users to request any report their little hearts desire. The AI will use its knowledge of the API and whip up that report lickety split. You’ll have to think pretty hard about per client query throttling, and make sure that reports can’t be generated that will crush your DB, but doing this sort of thing with graph QL requires this sort of thinking too. This is what you’re talking about, right?\n\nIf you want to skip the API, you need at least stored procedures so that the AI doesn’t just build its own dynamic SQL. That is a bit scary, but if you constrain access through stored procedures, then you again have control over the way the reports can be constructed with modular, testable composable, functionalized, data access layer components.\n\nLog each AI generated report with the actual query it constructs somewhere so you can go figure out what went wrong if something goes wrong. \n\nYou’ll get a freaking promotion, but it will take a little bit of time and you need to learn more about the different methods of using agents and such, rag, etc.",

Explicit flattening and managing columns yourself; the solution you started with is the most traditional and verbose. Makes most benefit of columnar indexing for performance \n\n2. Making raw data as structs. This has the benefit of displaying as a dictionary (represented close to a nested JSON structure), but you must define a fixed structure (schema on write), thus you lose some flexibility. Performance is expected to be good though, as BigQuery anyway implements this as if they were separate columns behind the scenes, at a physical level.\n\n3. Storing a JSON. Even if you use the JSON type, it's still a string. This is not indexed at all, and would be insanely bad for performance without at least some partitioning keys (like the Firebase replicated data naturally has).\n\nThe choice is yours and depends on your requirements, but I would stay away from #3 if you care about data modeling at all.",

If you’ve locked things into fixed columns, you’ll eventually have to deal with schema drift and painful backfills.\n\nThat’s why I prefer keeping the materialized layer in JSON. It’s still stored columnar in BigQuery, so you don’t lose efficiency, but you gain flexibility for evolving event structures. Then, if you need “wide” representations for certain use cases, you can always build views on top of the JSON (and even automate those views from your parameters table if you want).\n\nOne other thing: I’d avoid using a dedicated “parameters table” as the system of record for what keys exist. That approach tends to push business logic into data tables instead of code, and since tables aren’t version-controlled like your dbt models, it makes changes harder to track or roll back.\n\nSo in short:  \n\\- JSON gives you resilience against schema changes and type mismatches.  \n\\- Views let you expose wide tables when needed, without locking into a brittle schema.  \n\\- Keeping the logic in dbt models (instead of a parameters table) makes it easier to track history and review changes.\n\nThis way you’re balancing efficiency with long-term maintainability.",

There are two main challenges in migrating it to modern systems:\n\n* First - modern systems do not speak the language of structured datasets - so you will have to break it down into two parts - ingestion and transformation, and\n* Second - that typically there are a ton of infa mappings that companies have created over a period of time that becomes a pain to catalog and go through one by one - so bulk migration almost seems like the only way out.\n\nThankfully there is a system that is fully capable of taking on Informatica mapping style pipelines - it is called tabsdata and is an on-prem system that you can run on bare metal or on k8s clusters on the cloud. Bottom line you own it and and run it. This system offers the pub/sub for tables model for ETL. Here is how you use it to migrate infa pipelines:\n\n* Step 1: for every input port in the infa pipeline, you create a publisher that reads the input table and creates a tabs data table.\n* Step 2: for every transform in the infa mapping, you can create a transformer in tabsdata that will take one or more tables within tabsdata and do your join/aggregate/filter etc.\n* Step 3: once you have created the curated dataset, you add subscribers to it so that they can be loaded into the target platform.\n\nWhile this sounds like more work than one-to-one migration of infa mappings, you will be surprised at the ease and reusability that this approach produces and that itself could cut the pipeline complexity and count significantly. Check out [this overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVITxb-HSPQ&t=20s) to see if this is the right thing for you. Hope this helps.",

If it's an official API, then it just wasn't designed with bulk data loading in mind.\n\nIn any case, if you decide to go forward with this you will have to do as you describe: query stuff, cache whatever you can (like product categories which change less often) and create the relationships yourself. So take your time to model *everything*, create proper relationships between entities, build a proper request throttling mechanism for each entity (maybe by using queues) along with a retry mechanism (just check for http error 429 and do exponential backoff for example), write some tests and go with that.\n\nA dumb example where let's say the entities are \"product\\_summarized\", \"product\", \"region\", \"category\":\n\n1. Take note of the rate limits of each entity to configure the request throttling for your script.\n2. Query the categories & regions once a day to cache their values. \n3. Fetch a list of product\\_summarized using all the combinations of region and category.\n4. Fetch one product for each product\\_summarized using it's id property.\n5. Stich up everything together in a main function and run it.\n\nSteps 3 & 4 are to be executed under a request throttling mechanism so you don't get rate limited. And if you do, the retry mechanism will resume the operation.\n\nWill it be slow? Yeah it will. That's why you need a proper API in the first place.\n\nI've been through this a few times and I feel you. It's indeed a PITA.\n\nLet me know how it goes :)",

For tags, keep low-cardinality: orgid/buildingid, beamid, heightlevel, sensor\\_id; store temp/humidity/battery/rssi as fields. Avoid tags for anything that changes often.\n\nLive view: Durable Object broadcasts websocket updates from the latest aggregate point (not raw) at a fixed tick (e.g., 5s) to cap reads. Alerts: compute thresholds in Tasks and persist open/closed state in Cloudflare D1 or KV; you likely don’t need Redis. Long retention: dump raw to R2 daily as Parquet for cheap storage; analyze later with DuckDB/Spark if needed. Exports: precompute daily highs/lows via Tasks and serve from a tiny Postgres/D1 service.\n\nI’ve used Grafana and InfluxDB Tasks for rollups; DreamFactory helped expose REST endpoints over Postgres to manage alert state and exports without building a custom API.\n\nBottom line: keep the pipeline lean with Queues, Tasks, and sane tags; precompute what dashboards need and costs stay under control.",

Additive changes are easiest: BigQuery accepts new columns if you enable schema updates, and in Beam you can represent rows as maps or generic `Row` objects instead of hard typed classes. If a column disappears, guard against nulls and missing fields in your transforms. Renames or type changes are trickier, treat them as add + drop and keep a mapping or schema registry to track versions.\n\nFor API ingestion a simple GCP pattern is: Cloud Scheduler or Cloud Functions to fetch data, push raw payloads into Pub/Sub, run Dataflow for parsing and transforms, and land in BigQuery or GCS. That decouples ingestion from processing and gives you autoscaling and retries.\n\nDataproc is worth using only if you already have Spark/Hadoop jobs or need complex iterative workloads. For most ingestion + transform pipelines, Dataflow is simpler.\n\nSchema drift across sources follows the same patterns. For APIs, expect variable JSON and parse dynamically. For files, prefer schema-aware formats like Avro or Parquet, or read CSV headers dynamically. For RDBMS, use CDC tools like Datastream and evolve schemas downstream when columns change.\n\nHow often do you expect schema changes, and do you need real-time ingestion or is batch good enough? \n\nThat helps decide how strict to be on schema validation.

Always land raw payloads in GCS (Avro/Parquet) for replay. If drift is frequent and you need low latency: use CDC (Datastream or Debezium) to Pub/Sub, a streaming Dataflow job with a mapping table/versioned schema, dead-letter unknowns, and alerts. For APIs: Cloud Run/Workflows pulls -> Pub/Sub -> Dataflow -> BigQuery with idempotent MERGE and throttling. Dataproc only if you already have Spark jobs or need libraries Beam can’t handle well.

It gives you a clean way to organize pipelines (nodes + catalog + config), great for teams that want testable, modular data workflows. The data catalog abstraction is nice since it supports a bunch of backends, and tools like Kedro-Viz make it easier to reason about your DAGs.\n\nThe tradeoff is you don’t get connectors or managed ingestion out of the box. You’ll be writing Python to pull from sources, handle schema drift, and deal with APIs or CDC. It’s more of a framework than a platform. For batch work it’s nice, but for streaming or dynamic schemas you’ll end up adding boilerplate. You also need something external like Airflow, Argo, or Prefect for scheduling and monitoring.\n\nSo it’s great if your team is comfortable with Python and wants long-term maintainability, but not ideal if you’re hoping for plug-and-play ingestion. Do you want more control in code, or are you looking for a managed connector-style setup? That’s the real fork in the road.\n\nI work at Estuary, and we’ve focused on the managed ingestion side with schema evolution baked in, so if the Airbyte pain keeps getting worse that could be an easier alternative.",

This means that after every change to the tables, every new column, every change in team/domain structures, the governance steps need to be kept up-to-date. Someone needs to update lineage manually, change data quality rules, and make this a part of their development process.\n\nMy suggestion after implementing a couple of these types of solutions would be to either have a very clear post-implementation maintanence process mapped out, or to look for solutions that would already integrate the governance within the rest of the development lifecycle.",

A huge chunk of our data is unstructured and lives in on prem resources. The challenge wasn't just cataloging a cloud data warehouse, but getting a handle on this massive, distributed file environment.\n\nWe ended up using the integrated catalog that comes with our storage platform, DeepSpace storage. It was a good fit because its core job is to manage all of our on prem file storage. Since DeepSpace is already tracking every file for its tiering and archival purposes. There's no drift between the catalog and the storage because the catalog is the storage's metadata. Our resources lean onprom though, we may have gone a different way if we were primarily in the cloud.",

Thank you!\n\nFrom an engineering management perspective, the issue with QA is that if you assign a dedicated person to it, there is an idea that data quality would take a hit, as there is a person now entirely responsible for managing the quality of the data. Engineers just write code; they are not responsible for anything beyond that. But from a management point of view, there is an idea that the person who writes the code is actually responsible for the quality of the results. So, even though I understand SWEs/DEs have a long list of things to focus on and things might slip, having a person dedicated to QA reduces the idea of ownership.\n\nAlso, the idea about AI is true as well. I think QA was the first industry that took a major hit because of AI.",

It is like trying to do calculus when you can barely add two numbers. If someone wants to make a game without the foundation then they will most likely flounder about cause they are trying to start on step 10 where instead they need to start at step 1 (what language do you know, downloading an IDE etc...)\n\nBut with the prevalence of AI, the barrier has been reduced down considerably. I condone the idea of 'vibe' coding ie copy/pasting what you see and not digesting (reading what the AI spit out doesnt count). But I do recommend asking thoughtful questions that are small queries to AI (how to do print statement, why is ('hello' + d) not working etc...). And when you get the response back, think about why it is telling you the error is happening. So if ('I said hello' + 10 + 'times') threw an error then the AI might respond you cant add a str to an int. Now think about why that is ie you are adding two incompatible data types (string, int) which should lead you to asking what kind of data types are there and why data formatting is important etc...\n\nWork on the proof of concepts, small building blocks first. Even if it is stupid like learning how to add two numbers literally on some scratchpad of your coding IDE that will help you on your journey. It builds momentum, confidence and skill so you know what to employ .\n\nYour first iteration will suck ass. The first 1000 line of legitimate code will suck ass. Don't try to be perfect.

It's way more fun, and you learn more as well.\n\nMy general approach is: using online materials or books, read far enough to learn A Thing, then spend like a week mucking about with that Thing. For instance, you pick up your first book and learn how to do variable assignment, and print, input, and if statements in some language.  I would then spend a month writing text games in Python using only those components. And then I would learn about loops and arrays and write a bunch of better games. And then I would learn about writing my own functions and make it better again.",

In fact, the guy who wrote the book on design patterns has since shifted into appreciating functional programming implementations. \n\nBut remember the principles of OOP: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism. \n\nWhen you are writing code you know everything about what you’ve written, but you gotta think on the next person who might have to extend or use your code in some way. \n\nE.g.: I am implementing some logic where the variable “car_speed” should ONLY change when the operation “accelerate()” is executed. If I had them exposed then an ill advised user (coworker extending my code) might change car_speed directly and break my logic. \n\nOOP lets me abstract and encapsulate the logic and values. You have a class. It’s very explicit the values that it is concerned with and it exposes only the things others should be concerned. \n\nThen you have inheritance and polymorphism, those have to do with how blocks of logic usually repeat. Ideally you don’t want to copy and paste the same code many times, so it’s nice to have a framework on how the same logic can be repeated slightly differently many times",

A class made the most sense here because I could create a new instance of the class for every submission from the user, sanitize all input, build all the HTML, and do many other tasks, all very easily. If I were to accomplish that without using a class, it would probably involve a lot of spaghetti code and be difficult to understand.

You are still very young compared to retirement, so don't worry about age.\n\n>and I won't have any official programming degrees\n\nThis is what you should be worried about. If you can get one, do, if it's not possible, you can still make it, but it will be harder. Everything after is just my opinion, I am self taught, but joined in a much nicer job market, but what worked for me and what all my interviewers talked about was:\n\nA) My Github was clean, I followed the basic rules, you don't need green square every day but 3-6 days a week shows you're learning your ass off. Every repo has only one project. Every repo has a README.md that explains what it is, why you built it, how you built it, is it done, where can they see it, and anything else you want. The only repo that breaks these rules is one called \"Practice\" where all your code goes when doing small tutorials, practicing stuff, or just playing around. This folder has a readme that says \"Please Ignore this Repo\" or something so interviewers who check know not to bother. You should also be using proper git branching techniques, create feature branches with good names and good commit messages. Show whoever looks that you know how to work on a team and already know the basics, if you don't know them, learn them. \n\nB) My portfolio was nice. I didn't make the standard layer cake design, I also made sure to make it really easy to use, I used very clearly labeled sliding drawers to put all the data they could want on one splash page. I got lots of compliments about it. \n\nC) My project was a Recipe app that also included a shopping list and meal planner. Most of the functionality was there, that which wasn't was clearly shown in the readme, the design was terrible as I'm not a designer, but almost every interview talked about it in depth about why I built it, what tech I used, and why. \n\nUnfortunately now you also need to get past the AI gatekeepers, this is mostly a \"Stuffing your resume with keywords\" game. If it's in the job ad and you can honestly say you've used it, it should be in your resume and cover letter (if used) somewhere. Don't lie about what you can do, but if your roles have all been Angular, but the ad wants React and you work with React at home sometimes, maybe one of your roles was React...\n\nThe last thing I'll say that helped me a lot is \"Make a story\". Why are you doing this now instead of earlier. Look at your work history and, true or not, make a story about why you've finally realized Coding is your dream passion, because that's what you need interviewers to believe. You were amazing and doing great but \"lost\", then one day something happened that helped put you on this path to your true dream of becoming a coder. Make a story and build everything around it, your portfolio, your projects, whatever you can, the more the better. Practice answers to the obvious interview questions that explore and explain the story. Humans LOVE stories, especially coherent ones with growth where someone is finally achieving their dream. You need someone to take a chance on you, so you have to appear not to just be the best choice, but to be such an amazing choice that the lack of degree doesn't matter as your code is clean, your github is impeccable, your project shows the knowledge needed, and coding is your dream that you're finally realizing.\n\nSorry for length, you **can** do it, but it will be hard. Even for those with diplomas it can take 6-12 months of looking if they're not lucky... it's VERY much a numbers game though, just keep firing out resumes for any job that asks for less than 5 years of experience and isn't specifically a senior role. If you have any other questions or anything, just message.",

What's different between Windows or Linux or whatever else you might want to use. Learn how a file systems works.\n\nNetworking - super helpful to know a little about networking (think OSI model). Be able to write a toy client & server program.\n\nVirtual environments - maybe see what they're doing over on /r/homelab & look into proxmox.\n\nI don't like cloud computing so much because it is very opaque to me and that makes it difficult for me to build mental models of what is really going on.\n\nI find I'm a lot more effective and anything when I know some of the foundational things.\n\nLastly, read - when you see the same book mentioned (positively) in several blogs, maybe chase down that book.\n\nHappy learning. :-)",

But even that is relative to job title and expected general experience level. \n\nThus *strong* proficiency is that same idea, but better and more knowledgeable. I think for most roles, \"strong proficiency\" implies something beyond simply having existing knowledge and intermediate competency. It means having used a language enough to know many of its ins and outs, and having reasoned opinions about different approaches/methods/etc. which come from prior experience — on top of generally writing quality code. Someone with strong proficiency isn't stumbling their way to *some* working solution — they're choosing wisely from several possible approaches, and making deliberate decisions about *why* they're writing code a particular way. \n\nMy personal rule of thumb is that someone who can't articulate a personal take on what constitutes \"proficiency\" in a given language is almost certainly *not* highly proficient in that language.",

They don't explain that!\" Your goal is to say, \"How do I use this specific tool the best of it's ability and how do I know this tool's limits.\"\n\nIn many cases courses are hiding aspects you don't yet understand specfically because they are not tied directly to the thing that course is tying to teach.\n\nA course on data structures won't be teaching you any hardware hacks, because \"data structures\" are the meta of how to store and manipulate data and while certain choices might work better on certain hardware, the course is about teaching the differences between data structures. Why a programmer might chose a linked list, or double linked list over say a binary tree.\n\nIt's also about showing you ways to store data that are \"Worse\" or bad enough no one would do it so that you are learning the pitfalls about why we don't store data in an unsorted list. Instead when we add an element to the data we insert it in the sorted position to make searching in the future faster.\n\n* How to get out of tutorial hell? You just have to enough tutorials to cover:\n\n * How to select the correct pancake mix\n\n * Shipping it to your home.\n\n * How to mix batter\n\n * Errors that arise from licking the wisk\n\n * How to pour\n\n * How to use a spatula without flicking wet batter everywhere.\n\n * How to adjust heat on flame or electric stoves.\n\n* Once you have all the pieces learned you are leaving tutorial hell. The problem is that when you are in one tutorial, e.g. our spatula example, you aren't even aware of all the other steps that are being \"glossed over\" to teach you just that one aspect.\n\n * So you might learn spatula, and then heat, and think Why can't I make pancakes on my own yet! Not realizing there are like 20 more basic tutorial type deals you have to get through just to do that task.\n\n* In short I think tutorial hell is a by product of not having a good road map. If you are taking MIT's (Free) Open course-ware. You can look and see how many other courses you have to take to \"Get to the end\" the end being a certain level of education.\n\n * But even 4-year degree-ed under grads don't feel like they can step in and do everything. Because they can't. But hopefully they have the tools to lay out and study on their own and create a new plan to teach themselves what they need to accomplish some tasks.\n\n * But most of the time they are paired with a \"mentor\" at work that has struggled through the same things. What tools does the company use etc. And that person can give them the roadmap.",

And repeat this rule for every branch of the tree...\n\nWell then, for any given ID, starting from the `root`, you've either A) found the product, B) went down the `left` branch, or C) went down the `right` branch. Now as we established, we start with the middle ID, and we divide the inventory in HALF by both sides of the tree.\n\nWhat this means is you immediately determine which half the ID must be contained in, and you have thus cut your search space IN HALF. We don't have to check N elements, we instead check only O\\(log N\\) elements. The more elements you have, the more efficient the search. Each iteration cuts the remaining search field by half, every time.\n\nOf course, you get this in:\n\n    std::map<id_type, product_type> inventory;\n\n    //...\n\n    use(inventory[id]);\n\nYou can go faster still with a hash table.\n\n---\n\nMost of the job is searching, sorting, and transforming data. How you store the data and the algorithms you write to access that storage are intertwined. In C++, we get a few standard data structures, a few standard algorithms that are common, typical. Using a vector, or a map, or a hash table... It's easy to forget that these are both data structures AND algorithms hidden behind some convenient syntax; but a `map` implements a binary tree, and binary search! All you see is `inventory[id]`, and the rest is taken for granted. The structure and algorithms you use are decided when you are designing your solution, what best fits the problem you're trying to solve.",

Call by reference vs value. So many more. Sure, Python has its own things like decorators, descriptors, etc, but you can be proficient without a full understanding of them.\nExpect learning C++ to involve some core concepts, not just language semantics and common libraries.

It gets even worse as you open other projects, specially JS projects, because the language servers are also written in Javascript and use a ton of ram. The dev servers are also usually running Javascript. I constantly hit swap in my 16gb ram laptop due to this.\n\nYou can try a different IDE like Zed, but you still need to run the LSPs and devs servers, and since for some stupid reason JS devs tie their intellisense to their vscode extensions, you will lose a lot of intellisense.\n\nIt's a deeply stupid world we live in where people thought all of this was a good idea.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that since vscode is Electron, it won't even use your webview process to save ram. It will just open a whole ass browser process for itself.",

It is smaller. It is imperative - which isn't regarded as a benefit to YOU, but being a small, simple, imperative language is beneficial to transpilers; Golang is transpiled to C, and then compiled from that to machine code.\n\nC++ has more and higher level abstractions in the language itself, and it has an extensive standard library.

You can compile your program with a single command like:\n\n    gcc program.c -o program\n\nThere are of course about a million compiler flags that can change aspects of how the compiler works, what errors and warnings it emits, what architecture to compile for, what files to include, and on and on. Those are good things to know about, but not anything you need to know while you’re learning the fundamentals of C. \n\nIn short, you seem to want to do everything all at once. **Start with a good book about C.** Work your way through it, doing as many of the exercises as you can. Once you’ve finished that, you’ll be in a better position to decide what you want to learn next — IDE, compiler minutiae, debugging, source control, etc.",

Who knows, if I'm the interviewer and I have a fishy feeling that you're not \"up to snuff\" as it were, maybe I'll throw you a random algorithm question and see how you respond. And if you don't get the job, who knows, maybe you'll go off to Twitter or X or something and whine about how company Y wants people to memorize algorithms or something. Really? I don't think it's that simple in an interview situation.\n\nPersonally I think you should be able to program an implementation of something, given a description of an algorithm. All non-trivial programs that we are making nowadays are essentially algorithms to solve problems for which we (almost never) have a truly complete specification. The \"Algorithms\" in algorithms books are simply smaller problems which have been studied thoroughly, for which complete specifications exist.\n\nFor example, we know 100% what we mean to say whether a sequence is sorted or not, so it's easy to specify that a sorting algorithm takes a sequence for which that property may or may not be true and produces a sequence for which that property is true. \n\nThough even in that problem there are sometimes overlooked edge cases. For example, occasionally the difference between stable sort and unstable sort crops up naturally. If you have never studied algorithms, how likely is it that you would even understand the difference between a stable sort and a non-stable sort. Also how likely is it that you would know which algorithms guarantee stability and which ones don't?",

But we've all heard the mantra - those who don't know the past are doomed to repeat it.\n\nThere is a root to this wisdom that applies to all fields of learning - knowledge builds your intuition. Intuition is knowledge you don't actively think about. It's implied. It's inherent to your thinking. It silently informs you and influences you. If you watch a master of his craft, any craft, you will see they make it look so easy. They don't \"just know\" better, it's not merely muscle memory, it's a career of lessons learned, and decisions made, and fundamental concepts wholly and completely understood.\n\nSo a master developer can get cracking at code in an instant, whereas you might have to spend a lot more time trying to understand the problem and design a solution. The master can do it because all that understanding and design work? Yeah, they already did that - same as you, even for this very problem today, they just did the work 20 years ago...\n\nSo you learn this stuff not because anyone gives a shit whether you can actually implement a binary tree in an interview. RARELY do we implement primitive and fundamental data structures ourselves. The point is that you understand it, and you end up leveraging that intuition in all your thinking for the rest of your career.",

Preferably `subprocess.run` with `check=True` so that any errors that occur will get raised into exceptions.\n\n  \nUsing `Popen` directly is useful if you don't want the function to block while the program is running, so it's useful for opening a program for the user that will stay open for some indeterminate amount of time, like opening a text editor, the calculator, etc. (if this is your intention, do NOT use Popen in a with statement, just call it directly.) `subprocess.run` is probably what you usually want for command line utilities because you'll actually be able to see the results.\n\n  \nThere is also `subprocess.call` and `subprocess.check_call`, these are okay but the docs describe them as an \"older API\" meant for use by \"existing code,\" so I'd probably just stick to `subprocess.run` for anything new\n\n*also, `Popen` and `subprocess.run` will let you pass strings as the first argument like you can with `os.system`.

One time I thought I had to hit the shell was for a cross platform way to run the \"default program\" for a file, via `start` on Windows, `open` on Mac, or `xdg-open` on Linux. However, the latter two are actual binaries and not shell commands so they can be opened via `Popen`, while the former has a dedicated Python function, `os.startfile`, so in all cases it is possible to avoid hitting the shell.",

Maths and logic make some of the algorithmic work seem very easy - for every computation, simply select the result from the real numbers - it's easy!\n\nBut when dealing with actual physical devices that need to exploit electrons to get you that answer, you have to concede a wee tiny bit to that - like for example that numbers don't have infinite precision. That part used to be a lot bigger (with directly programming assembly instructions or managing memory), but it's still there, hidden under layers of compilers that translate your code to stuff the machine can work with.\n\nOne thing you can do is to flip your mental switch and not treat programming as something goal oriented, but with the mathematicians curiosity of: okay, I have this set of primitives (your language and the idealised computer it runs on) - what can I do with this? What interesting stuff can be found in the set of all possible programs - and how does that change if I use a different idealised machine (for example with an ARM chip vs an x86-64 chip) or with a GPU.",

So the declarations `int x;` and `float y;` will both allocate 4 bytes of memory.\n\nBut the *interpretation* of those bits/bytes is different depending on the type. So the compiler generates different code to work with them.\n\nFor instance, the 32- bit pattern `00111110000000000000000000000000` represents the numeric value 0.125 when interpreted as a float, or the integer value 1040187392 when interpreted as an int. And if you want to do something like add the bit patterns representing two numbers, the logic for doing that will be totally different depending on whether they're ints or floats.\n\nSo if you write the statement `x += 1;`, the compiler generates code to load the value of `x`, perform an *integer* addition, and store the value back into `x`. But if you do `y += 1;`, a *floating-point* addition is performed instead. (And the compiler is smart enough to automatically convert the integer constant `1` into the floating-point constant `1.0` so that the types are compatible.)\n\nSo in general, the purpose of data types is to help the programmer (and the compiler) keep track of how any given chunk of memory is \"supposed\" to be interpreted.",

Type systems are essentially logical calculi (in fact typed programs are in a very real sense equivalent to logical proofs), and in writing your code (with types) you build up a logical formula that the compiler then can reason about to some extent (which is ultimately what results in it reserving enough space for your data, using the right instructions etc). There's drastic differences in the \"power\" of those logical systems: with C you're very much on the weak side of things, which means types really are rather \"stupid\". Other languages go far further here, allowing you to encode way more intricate properties via types -- which then for example results in dealing with types that don't have \\*any\\* possible values, or that have values that have no size in memory at all \\[and contrary to what you might initally expect these types turn out to be \\*very\\* useful in practice\\].  \n\n\n(An issue with what you wrote is that `int` is not generally guaranteed to be 4 bytes, but that's more of an issue with C and many introductory resources.

The idea of adding AI into literally everything is a fad that will probably disappear.\n\nShitty 2025 AI toasters and ice makers are a fad.  2075 AI toasters and ice makers are absolutely a potentially legitimate product with staying power.\n\nThe underlying tech is not going anywhere.  It will normalize over time and disappear into the infrastructure. Same way microchips went from novelty, to places they had no right to be given their limited capabilities, to fully useful and effectively invisible infrastructure.\n\nIn my view, AI and machine learning should be requisite courses for a CS degree, at least up to basics like minimax and neural networks.  You’d be wise to take them as electorates for your understanding, if nothing else, even if you never directly use a neural network in all of your career.\n\n> The absolute most important thing you should do is not use AI to help with your coursework.

Companies have no interest in someone with a degree who can't code without the help of AI. Don't let that happen to you.\n\nWhile this is all accurate, this advice is better framed as “don’t cheat yourself.”  Using AI to help with your homework is fine.  The problem comes when you pack it up and start playing video games after the computer did your homework for you, and you didn’t take the time to learn how to solve it on your own.  It’s not the fault of the AI that you didn’t bother to actually learn anything.  That’s on you.\n\nAnd the problem I have with blanket advice like “don’t use AI” is that **you’re missing out massively if you are not using AI for the purpose of self-learning.**  \n\nUse AI as your personal tutor who clears up your misunderstandings, answers your “stupid” questions, and helps you understand complex topics, not a nerd that you bully into doing your homework.  It can even help you with your homework, but your goal needs to be to obtain knowledge and understanding.  You will progress much faster with AI than without it, if you’re using it competently.",

        "body": "Massively simplified analogy: You need to find the email of Professor Dan to beg him to let you into his full class next semester. There are a number of ways you can go about getting that:\n\n1. Ask your current CS teacher what Dan's email is. He says \"I don't know, Professor Smith might know though.\" So you go ask Professor Smith what his email is and she says \"I don't know, but Professor Stevens might know.\" You go ask Professor Stevens and she says \"I don't know, try Professor Jones.\" You keep going down the chain, each person telling you to go talk to someone else, until you reach someone who knows what the email is, and who knows how many people you're going to have to talk to and you just don't want to do that.\n2. So you realize that oh wait, you can just look him up in the staff directory and find the email that belongs to him. You know he's a CS professor so you can just start with the CS directory instead of scanning down from Dr. Aarons in Academic Advising, and you already know the guy's name is Professor Dan so you can just jump to D.\n\nThat's basically the difference between finding something in a linked list vs. hash table In reality it's a bit more complicated:\n\n3. Suppose you go to the staff directory and it's not in alphabetical or department order -- it seems totally random. Also, it's split into 20,000 pages. So you have no idea where Dan is and you're thinking you've got to just work your way down, and you really don't want to do that. But then you see that the directory is maintained by the department weirdo Dr. Bryant. You go ask Dr. Bryant, who tells you almost immediately \"Dan? He's on page 56.\" You ask, astonished: \"You just memorized that???\" Dr. Bryant: \"Nah, I just multiplied the letters of DAN, so 4 \\* 1 \\* 14 is 56.\"\n\n4. You go to page 56, and sure enough there's Dan's bio and email. Problem solved! But then the next day you have a realization and go back to Dr. Bryant: \"Wait a minute, what if you hire another guy named Dan? Only one of them can be on page 56, your system won't work anymore.\" Bryant goes \"Uh..... wait, I know, his employee ID is 4LBA8F, and his ID is unique so I can just use that instead!\"\n\n5. Satisfied, you leave his office, then 2 minutes later turn around and go back in. \"But that's not gonna work either, what if you have employee 222 and 22B? Or 2BB? What about 6666, 666F, 66FF?\"  Dr. Bryant says he needs to think about that.\n\nThis is also massively simplified and obviously the actual calculations are more complicated, but that's the general idea: since your data is probably not going to be perfectly ordered, you need to come up with a function to map each item to a numerical value, and that value will be the index to the \"bucket\" of memory that data will go into. You don't want that function to come up with different values because that makes things complicated, but unless you have an infinite amount of space, it's impossible to prevent that completely. All you can do is try to limit how often it happens; there's mathematical theory for the best ways to limit that and various implementations for how to handle whatever collisions do happen.\n\n\"OK, why not make it ordered then?\" You could do that, but then you'll have to continually fix the order every time you insert new data, instead of just crunching a number for where to insert it. So if you're doing a lot of insertions compared to lookups, that may not be ideal.",

Very sophisticated CPU caches do have the ability to notice that you're chasing pointers (they correlate values previously loaded with the addresses fetched) but that's most helpful if you repeatedly access shallow data structures.\n\nThere just isn't much that can be done to hide memory latency when the data structure is really deep.\n\nIf a linked list is the best choice it's probably because you need a LIFO or FIFO queue and search is rare.\n\nOther points in favor of linked lists\n\n* concurrent LLs (multiple threads will access at the same time) are easier than concurrent hash tables and compete with concurrent ring buffers\n* The objects you intend to link are members of some other data structure and the LL acts as an alternate way to access them.  It's difficult to get these chimera data structures to work correctly, the simplicity of LLs helps\n* sometimes you really need O(1) worst case insertion time (if so you also need to prevent page faults)",

You need a pointer if you want to modify the input, because the function is gonna delete any copy it makes after it exits.\n\nAs for syntax things: 'pointer->item' is just a pointer access operator. It's short hand for '\\*(pointer).item'\n\nBut tbh, this doesn't look like a pointer issue on your part. Like, the code wouldn't change much if this were C++ code using a class or something. This code is pretty clear, so this is a comprehension issue, and I'm hoping you at least got told how a queue works before you got the slides.\n\nIf you know what a Queue is, what's going on here is that your prof has defined a few functions that take a Queue pointer as input, and didn't tell you how they work yet. The prof has also defined a Queue struct, and hasn't told you how that was implemented either. Odds are, your prof intended you to read this and interpret it kinda like pseudo code. Or you didn't read far enough in his lecture slides to find the rest of the info. Either way, read the whole set of slides before jumping to conclusions.\n\nThe Queue struct would seem to be implemented using an array. My guess is it probably looks something like this:\n\n    typedef struct {\n        int back = 0; // index of the last item in the array\n        'Datatype' val[CAPACITY]; // where we store everything in the queue. Can be of any type. \n    } Queue;\n\nThen there's the functions he defined. In order:\n\n* int length(Queue q\\*) : Tells you how many things are stored in the array. Likely derived from Queue.back's index. \n* int isEmpty(Queue q\\*) : Tells you if length is 0. \n\nEither way, point remains: Ask your prof. This is what office hours are for. Or e-mail them.",

When a program is running, it has access to its segment of program memory, with each unit of memory (byte, word, dword whatever depending on architecture) having an address.\n\nThe point of data structures is to store the program's data in memory in a cohesive structure that is fast for your usecase and lets you access it later. Data structures (and pointers) are the tools by which you manage memory for your program.\n\nYou know that a pointer is an address to a piece of memory. Getting the value of the memory at that address is called *dereferencing* the pointer. Dereferencing uses the \\* operator. \\*ptr will give the value at pointer ptr.\n\nYour queue has an offset to the current last element (called back). This holds the offset of the address of the first free address of the queue. The function enqueue also takes in a queue pointer called q. To access the value of back, you would first have to dereference the queue pointer \"q\", then access its instance variable \"back\". Because dereferencing a pointer to an object to access one of its attributes is such a common occurrence, there is a special operator -> that does exactly that. If q was not a pointer to a queue object but rather the queue object itself, you would access back by doing q.back. but because q is a pointer, you do q->back.\n\nPointers can also be *indexed into* meaning to take the address referenced by pointer p and adding the number in brackets to that address. For example if pointer p had the address 0x00001, then you could reference the value at address 0x00002 by doing p\\[1\\].\n\nTo trace your code with all of this understanding is pretty simple. The function first checks if the queue is full (meaning a new element cannot be added) and simply returns in this case.\n\nIf the queue is empty, set the first element in the queue to newData. The variable val is an instance pointer to the start of the queue. q->val\\[0\\] refers to the data value at the address at the start of the queue.\n\nback, as previously established is the offset from the base of the queue (val) to the next free address in the queue. To add a value to a non-empty queue, the code stores back in a temporary value, idx. The code then stores newData in that address (val\\[idx\\] is the same thing as saying val\\[q->back\\]), then increments back by one, ensuring that it continues to be the offset of a free address.",

In Python this looks like this: `if __name__==\"__main__\":` In this way your code will only execute if you actually run the file, not if you import it. \n\n3. I like that you commented everything pretty well. Your comments are not very detailed, but they give me a good idea what a codeblock should do very quickly. \n\n3.5. As a tip for comments: Use docstrings [https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) In many IDEs docstrings show up when you hover over a function, do quickly tell you what it does. \n\n4. In line 150, I would suggest using an object, or a dictionary to store the data, since it's closely related to each other. There will never be a case, where you want to keep the vitals of the old patient, but generate a new name for example. This could be done like this: \n\n    class Patient():\n      \"\"\" represents Patient data\"\"\"\n      def __init__(self, name, id, status, vitals, dialogue, is_expected):\n        self.name = name\n        self.id = id \n        [...]\n    \n    [...]\n        type_out(f\"Patient Name: {patient.name}\")\n        \n\nYou already seem to use a smaller version of this as a dictionary in `generate_expected_patient_list()`, so I think unifying both datastructure would be a good idea, especially if you want to develop this game further. \n\n4.5: You also seem to use the exact same line of code `type_out(f\"Name: {p['name']}, ID: {p['id']}\")`quite a few times. This could be rolled into the class I suggested above, giving Patient a method to type\\_out their name and id. You would then use it in code as `patient.type_out()` for example. \n\nAll in all your code is structured okay, but for better readability you could thinnk about moving the actions and the new\\_day part of your loop into their own functions. This might not look like a benefit in your codebase right now, but if your game logic gets bigger, like a few thousand lines of code bigger, your game loop really should look roughly like this: \n\n    while True:\n      new_patient = get_new_patient()\n      action = get_player_action()\n      handle_action(action)\n      check_game_over(strikes)\n      check_new_day(expected_patients)\n\nAnyways, good job for a beginner :) Keep it up!",

Many high-performance ECS systems represent entities as an Integer and map that to the set of components.\n\nI’m not sure if this is incidental or an intentional feature, but ECS can have components added and removed on the fly at runtime, and there’s not a huge amount of scenarios where that’s a requirement(plugin systems), and there are at least some where it’s an anti-pattern.

Keep components as plain data and systems as stateless functions. Batch adds/removes, avoid per-entity allocation, and use versioned IDs to prevent stale references. Start small: convert projectiles or NPC vision to an ECS-style loop and measure. For engines: archetype ECS (DOTS, Bevy, Flecs) is great for dense queries; sparse-set (EnTT) tolerates high churn. On “render-bound” games: servers and complex sims are often CPU-bound, so ECS helps there.\n\nAWS GameLift and Redis handled sessions and state for me, and DreamFactory generated REST APIs over Postgres for ops dashboards and tooling without me hand-rolling controllers.\n\nBottom line: use ECS where data-parallel hotspots justify it, mix simpler patterns everywhere else.",

You should do that too, but with python. Don't try to build AI - just do Simple stuff and see, where it goes. Some fun memes, some silly stuff. In University, they make you print these pyramids from ***********. Do that! Create triangle from the *******. Then square! Then chess board pattern. Nothing too complicated. And you gonna feel that this is silly, and who is ever going to need stuff like that? Well, I have seen websites that use these star patterns in a really unique way, and it looks awesome!

Even with 3+ years in software, revisiting CS fundamentals isn’t about re-learning the basics, it’s about connecting theory with these more mathematically heavy AI frameworks.

Are some emulators so far removed that we shouldn’t call them emulators? Like this one? Apparently the guy used the emulator to make it 1000x faster!!!

Just to clarify, I'm not some kind of genius, this is all pretty standard stuff that would be covered in digital logic and computer architecture courses in a typical CS curriculum.\n\nTo thoroughly answer your questions I would basically have to teach one of those courses, and I'm not going to try to do that. Instead I'll just try to clarify my previous comment a bit.\n\nYou have to distinguish between the *simulated* CPU (the custom 16-bit design that the Youtuber you linked came up with) and the *real* CPU that is being used to run the simulation.\n\nA real CPU is made out of many millions of physical logic gates. All of those logic gates operate simultaneously. But they work together so that the real CPU executes one \"instruction\" at a time. (This is a massive oversimplification, but it's good enough for this discussion.)\n\nLet's say that the simulated CPU needs a few hundred logic gates to make a 32-bit adder. If you write a gate-level software simulation on the real CPU, the simulation will have to process each of those logic gates one at a time. So like I said, it will take many hundreds or thousands of real CPU instructions to *simulate* a single addition operation on the simulated CPU. That's what I meant by \"iterate\". The simulator has to go through each logic gate one at a time to compute its result.\n\nIf instead, you write an emulator that runs on the real CPU, then when it needs to add two numbers, it can execute a single `ADD` instruction. Now, *physically*, that `ADD` instruction is still implemented within the CPU by many logic gates. But because those gates are real physical things, all operating simultaneously, they don't have to be simulated one at a time. They all happen in parallel. So the execution is much faster. (But the physical arrangement of the CPU's logic gates is fixed in hardware. You can't customize it the way you could customize a gate-level simulation that's performed in software.)\n\nI'm just using addition as an example, but the same principle applies to other things too. The 16-bit CPU has lots of other control circuitry that decides *what* instruction to execute at any given time. That control circuitry is made up of many logic gates. But the work that is done by a large number of logic gates can alternatively be implemented by a smaller number of CPU instructions on the real physical CPU, doing the same work directly, without simulating the behavior of all the individual gates.\n\n> And why does the guy’s actual processor itself get to skip over all of those logic gates that logism can’t?\n\nThey're not \"skipped over\". But when you take the logic design that was being simulated in Logisim, and build it out of real physical logic gates, then those gates are all operating in parallel. So you don't have to wait for a software simulation to process them one at a time.\n\n----\n\nIf you want to learn more about this topic, I would suggest going through the free self-guided [Nand2Tetris course.](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)",

I think the hard part learning C++ is that it’s a huge language that, as I said, have changed a lot during its lifetime so it’s programming style have changed every 5 years or so, so it’s a moving target and will take time to catch up and keep up (Even Scott Meyers gave up).",

The advice I would give to a beginner would be something more like this:\n\n1) Have a specific goal of what you want to accomplish by learning programming\n2) Make sure that what you're doing is moving you towards that goal\n\nSo many people skip (1) when they're asking for advice on what to do, but it's super important. Why *specifically* do you want to learn programing? Is it to make video games? Or is it to automate business processes at your accounting firm? Or is it to hack your smart-fridge? Those are all vastly different skill sets, with different paths you'll need to take in your learning. Knowing what you want to do is so so important to making sure you're learning the right things.\n\nOnce you've figured out (1) step (2) is a lot easier (still hard though!). Usually, step (2) starts with following one comprehensive course on the relevant programming language / framework / environment. Make sure it's a high quality, modern course on the topic. As you go, make sure you're doing exercises, and writing code independently to test that you're following along. **Once you've finished this course, you should have the \"vernacular\"** that you're talking about in your post. At that point, you can start building (small) projects.\n\nOftentimes where people get stuck on (2) is that they jump around between too many different tutorials, they don't learn things on their own, or they don't focus on the learning that will actively help them achieve their goals. But doing a single, high quality course is definitely not \"tutorial hell\".\n\nPeople who suggest doing projects are right that the true, deep learning comes after you've taken the training wheels of a course or tutorial off. There's a lot of important and valuable struggle that comes from putting the pieces together yourself. But you really want to go into your first projects with a decent understanding of the fundamentals, otherwise it will be hard to see the forest for the trees.",

You get 80% of the benefit from just picking up heavy shit and putting it back down, and 18% of the remaining 20% from doing the easiest optimizations (alternating which muscle groups are worked + watching your calories).\n\nThe obvious thing everyone can agree on but gets lost in the argument is that it's pointless to focus on your diet, get perfect sleep, and buy the right supplements... but never actually go to the gym.\n\nWe can (and do!) argue on and on about if it's optimal to build projects, watch presentations from industry professionals, focus on languages versus abstract CS ideas, learn through integration or building from scratch, if you should focus on learning functional and declarative paradigms, philosophies of state management, keeping up with industry standards...\n\n... and the advice of \"go *practice*\" gets lost.\n\nGo. Try to build something. It'll be bad. You'll probably get completely stuck at some point. Research how other people solved the problem. Watch some tech talks or YouTubers, read a blog, whatever. Find a library that does the thing. Try again. It'll be better. Still bad. Rinse and repeat.

Further, like you suggest, there's a very good chance there is no \"ball\" in the implementation and the server is picking whether you win based on chance (if you check the call to the server, it might not even bother saying which cup was clicked).\n\nThat's not to say that this sort of mistake never happens. There have certainly been failures of this type many, many times before. An example of this sort of failure was in the early 2000s, when the government occasionally redacted PDF files by drawing black boxes over text...but it left the text under the boxes, so when users just deleted the boxes, they could see the text. People goof. But gambling sites are usually careful about this sort of thing. It could be an educational exercise for you to check.",

Freedom which could be abused.\n\nThe point of something like Flash is to run code from external third-party sources, which are by definition potentially untrustworthy. Abuse prevention is part of the bare minimum requirements.\n\nIf I go to a website, and a plugin automatically loads some content, and the plugin gives too much \"freedom\" to **some other developer's** code to do what it wants with **my** computer, then the plugin is not fit for purpose.\n\nModern browsers like Chrome and Firefox have put a lot of work into sandboxing HTML/JS code so that it can run *safely* even if the code is untrustworthy. Modern HTML-based webapps give just as much \"freedom\" to developers to make actual content as Flash did -- the existence of [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) is proof of this. But that freedom is kept safely within a high-quality sandbox.\n\nThe difference is in the implementation, not the overall architecture. Macromedia/Adobe *could* have put as much careful work into sandboxing as the browser developers did. And then they would have had an equally high-quality, secure system. But they didn't, and that's why their product sucked.",

Doesn't matter whether I'm installing cable from the telephone pole, cleaning toilets, coding scheduling apps for sports venues.\n\nI still love coding flash/animate/air though. Been exclusively in C# now for 4 or 5 years. My impression is that Adobe did a friggin amazing job of the rework from AS2 to AS3, but that was another nail in the coffin, because all the old AS2 programs could not be converted. I coded some things to convert from AS2 to AS3 and it was a nightmare.\n\n(C# seems to suffer from the problem AS2 had where there was not enough uniformity with web service calls and event handler delegates.)\n\nAdobe Flash through AIR did work on the iPad as an app, so it did have its little security sandbox there. It had terrible performance on the iPad 1, but it was totally fixed on the iPad 2. I made many apps with it including a 10 point touch app that was on a floor to ceiling monitor where multiple people could interact with it. A heart rate monitor app in a fitness studio with time synced looping video on 16+ iPads displaying the composite heart rates on a 70\" screen all timed with music programs that the owners made on the server.\n\nI made about $100,000 from that job. So, not good at man negotiating. I'm a trans woman and my masculine behaving first wife was the only female in the 18 piece Memphis Jazz Orchestra. She would sit on my left playing bass trombone and the amazing leader trombonist on my right. We made $25-$50 a night playing on Beale St.\n\nThat scheduling app was about a $100,000 thing too. Yes, security would have been an ongoing thing with it. That StripeJS implementation seems like it changes every 5 months and my career was certainly going in a direction where I wouldn't be around forever to maintain it. My doctors tend to retire too.\n\nAlso coded a CNC machine. Arduino, stepper motors, pump switch, scale. Used a wireless Adobe AIR tablet to calibrate and control it. Made less than $20,000 on that gig.\n\nAlso a js audio podcast recorder/editor for less than $10,000. I could never find anyone to handle the negotiating end of it. What is the trade? Where is work in the world headed? Do we need more hydro electric more than new software?Have you called your electric provider and asked them how the grid would handle increasing backflow from solar panels? I did back in like 2014.\n\nQ: Can you cook a steak with a solar panel without the grid, a battery or a flux capacitor?",

The Fitness studio app with the heart rate monitors, looping video, time syncing and audio coordinated with the server was more fun to code than the Enterprise sports venue scheduling app.\n\nThat scheduling app was mostly a web app and the flash component of it was just the iPad in the lobby so that people could register. But it did take payments. They had different things like lessons and booking courts. The lessons had some kind of special thing for the instructor's schedule. There were calendar interfaces. There were admin features. There was emailing invoices and reminders. And of course credit card transactions. I used the technique of taking the entire Stripe response json and putting it in a database field because you don't need to perform query searches on that kind of info. If you need it, you'll be in that record and can parse that json to make the little invoice again. LOL, I remember doing a year end batch job scheduled in off hours to make an archive of PDF files off that json data. Likely a cron job during off peak hours.\n\nI do know the industry, right? I'm not making malicious code. Sure, I'm kind of R&D instead of union software house programmer.

Depending on the case, C# might be perfect, or Rust, or Go, etc.\n\nFor example, if I’m building a CRUD API, no matter how fast Rust is (and it’s not always the fastest), TypeScript will usually win in most aspects. But if a small part of that API needs heavy, low-level computation, that’s where Rust or Go could really shine.\n\nThe bottom line: define the problem first, and the right tools will follow. There’s no single technology that’s a universal solution.",

It's kind of hard to track what is actually running in production with your current setup. You don't have any kind of versioning, immutable artifacts. You can't really roll back since you can't really be sure the build is reproducible. Your server is doing multiple things, not running stable artifacts. \n\nSo obviously your setup isn't really something that would be used in production/professional settings. But if it's enough for you that let's say once a day your server might be updated with new code assuming there is something new in the repo, the cronjob doesn't fail etc. then cronjob keeps it simple, so why not if some or none of the concerns with the setup really matter to you. \n\nI'd probably at least consider doing it properly, for experience and learning purposes if nothing else.

Some thoughts:\n\n>a cron job that checks out the repo, say, once a day, and if there's anything new, pull and build.\n\nNot a good idea, to be honest. Deployment should be a purposeful, manual action. Automation here should be about making deployments a push-button exercise, not actually automatic. You want merges to a (often protected) master/main branch (or whatever) to kick off builds (of containers), tests, etc, but stop right before touching your actual deployment. If everything is good, you push the button. The cron job idea is a recipe for disaster in real environments.\n\n>I just want to `git pull` and `docker compose up --build` when I cut a new release.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with just doing this manually via ssh. You can script it via ssh too so that it's a one-liner. Or have a GH Actions flow do it when you manually run a flow. Usually you'd have automations (pipelines) build your images and put them in a registry, then deployment automation can pull them from there to get containers.",

That said, if this is a production project, it will eventually be a good idea to run tests before deploying and proper workflows will scale to that more easily than an ad-hoc script.\n\nI would not recommend the cron approach, because it bundles multiple changes together into a single unmonitored deploy. Usually people will either do continuous deployment, where every merged commit is automatically verified and then deployed immediately, or they will do manual deployments where post-release validation can be performed. Opinions differ, but I’m in the camp that says continuous deployment is better if you have the level of automated testing and monitoring needed to make it safe. Deploying one change at a time makes it easier to determine what caused breakage when it occurs.\n\nWith a cron job deployment you’d get the worst of both worlds. A bunch of changes would bet bundled together, making error tracing harder. You probably won’t be verifying the deployment after it occurs, because it’s on a schedule. And it won’t be immediately clear what changes are deployed or not at any given point in time, which can be very frustrating in practice.",

I'm afraid that's all you're going to find. I thought you wanted to build your own browser? If so, MiniBrowser is a perfect place to start - a working bare-bones browser with a clean slate so you can build whatever you want on top of it.\n\nIf you want a complete browser with modern features to extend and modify, that doesn't exist on Windows based on WebKit right now, as far as I know.",

        "body": "This question is so extremely common nowadays that a simple search through the subreddit would have given you more than plenty answers.\n\nWhen you get an assignment, don't directly start programming. **Plan** before program. Sit down with pencil and paper and work over the assignment. Analyze it, break it down into steps. Solve each of the steps **your** way, don't even think about programming at that stage. Track the steps. Once you have a working solution, test it. Then, when the solution is confirmed, start *implementing* it in code. Ideally, when you've done the breakdown right, the code should come naturally. Use whatever you can think of: bulleted lists, flow charts, pseudo code, anything to write down what the program has to perform.\n\nCode is the end, not the beginning. Analysis, breaking down, planning, solving are the beginning. Code comes later.\n\nJust *reading* completed code will not help you building the ability to solve problems. Reading code is like looking at a complete car in order to learn to design a new car. You miss everything important: analysis, decisions, considerations, compromises. You might get an understanding of the *immediate* solution, but not the skills to apply this to even slightly different situations.\n\nBuild your own projects starting from something as small and simple as Tic-Tac-Toe and working your way gradually up to larger and more complex. Yes, this will take time, effort, determination, discipline, and patience, but that's the way to go. Not the easy road to use google, AI or tutorials for everything.\n\nProgramming is lifelong learning. It takes months to build up basic competence, years to obtain some proficiency and a lifetime for expertise.\n\n-----\n\nAbout your task:\n\n> i had to create a license plate checker which would output valid or invalid.\n\nWell, not much information you give here, but still:\n\nWhat do you need for your program?\n\n+ You need some form of getting the license plate - user input\n+ you need a place to store the license plate - variable\n+ There are some rules that you need to follow (which you haven't told - so, I'm blind guessing)\n   + most likely, you will need to extract each character from the license plate - you will need a way to split the entered data and a store for it - maybe an array - could just as well be that you only need to loop over each character\n   + you need to perform some action with the character - maybe some summing, multiplication, etc.\n   + At the end, you will get some checksum or some indication\n+ you will need to verify that indication (conditional)\n+ you need to output valid or invalid\n\nThat's the way to break down a problem. The more detailed you do it, the easier it will be to implement the code.\n\n-----\n\n\nI'll leave some comment from a [former, similar post](https://redd.it/1mhcd21) here:\n\nHonestly, most of it is down to practice. Use sites like [Exercism](https://exercism.org) for ample practice exercises.\n\nThere are several books commonly recommended:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nAnd finally, I'll leave some of my comments to previous, similar posts, as this is a very frequently discussed topic:\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j9ezmx/getting_better_at_coding/mhdna2e/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1iz7wv3/how_to_become_a_better_engineer/mf10qbg/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j3w7x9/how_to_actually_learn_problem_solving_skills/mg3q9ya/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ioehwa/struggling_to_put_together_my_own_code/mcirhxq/\n+ https://redd.it/1jyd36k",

You can also look into containerizing your app and hosting on ecs in AWS with Fargate. All of that is pretty cheap. \n\nAlso - real quick - Apache isn’t hosting your app, it’s a web server, it’s only serving traffic to your app. It’s not necessary when hosting your app online unless you use a virtual machine like EC2, at which point you can serve the traffic to your app with Apache and use EC2 to actually host it allowing traffic either using a load balancer or directly through security groups on a public subnet.\n\nAlso if you want to go a step further you can give a meaningful domain name by creating a hosted zone in route53 and adding a dns record to point to your machine. I think netlify does this automatically tho asking for a domain name, you can probably purchase one through them if they don’t do it automatically",

To open a port, go in your router settings.\n\nAnother way is if you own a domain, you can use cloudflare tunnels to bridge your pc's local network and your domain. This is more secure(no need to provide ip whenever youre wanting to share your website), but you need to have a domain(like 12+$/yr) and you need to run another program on your computer to do the tunneling.(if you dont have domain, ngrok works too)\n\nThat being said, for a simple no backend website, you can use something like github pages, or literally any other service, they provide a free hosting for static websites. If you need backend(or well, anything running on the desktop or something) aswell it not likely to be free but you can get them preety cheap still.",

All the work has moved up an abstraction layer, so to speak.\n\n- There is a huge skill differential between programmers, and people were erroneously claiming that anyone who could fizzbuzz or write a select statement could get a job, even though this hasn't been true for years. You actually need to be pretty good and be ready to hit the ground running to consistently find work these days.\n\nAnyways, all the students that have graduated from CS programs or bootcamps over the past couple years, or will graduate in the near future, are preparing for jobs that no longer exist and aren't coming back. Tech will continue to flourish as a sector, but unless you are a real gold star candidate (right connections, right school, highly technically capable, etc.) the path is only going to become more bleak for individual developers, and if you're just starting in the industry, it'd be wise to get out now.",

At my company, we had code from mid 2010s that was something a 6 month bootcamp grad could write better, but it was done by a long time employee with a CS degree (so please don't use that as an excuse). This guy is considered a highly experienced person at our company, but he writes atrocious code. Even dumbasses were getting hired and to the business person it looked like complicated magic. A lot of bad workers got easy jobs. Sorry you missed out. That's the truth of it. Now that shit doesn't cut it and isn't even necessary with some of the low level stuff being easily automated with AI.\n\nThe problem is that you can't truly differentiate yourself from the really stupid Cs get degrees type of CS student (and with grade inflation so big now at places like Ass State University, even poor programmers can be a 4.0 grad).

Even with the wlb not being what it is in tech, it's better than probably the vast majority of healthcare professions for higher pay than most in tech.\n\nEdit: just a follow-up, I'm advising \"no not worth it\" based on the most basic of info, but it's worth doing research to lay out all the numbers of what the course timeline/schedule would look like, job market and salary prospects for what to expect in your area, etc. We can't possibly know the complete picture here. The paycheck's great for a few years until you have those savings, but to be clear I'm not saying he should stick with a job he doesn't like for the rest of his life.",

Let me just tell you how disheartening it is now that most of my simple ideas and projects are capable of being done by a prompt rather than the hours it takes to study, understand the material, research libraries and cross reference other methods in order to create some code. I fear that the kind of jobs I wanted to have won't exist by the time I get out there. I enjoy trucking but there is no industry that AI will not touch.  My employer has implemented a camera in our trucks that already use AI and it's capable of detecting our eye movement to know if we are distracted, drowsy, and tracks our following distance, speed, braking, turning and any other metric you could imagine to gauge the competency of a truck driver. Then gives us a score and compares us to other drivers in the fleet. I dislike it but it's the future. I hope you find the job you are looking for but this is the end of an era and the birth of something we cannot stop nor fathom the implications and what will be on the other side of this.

I'm not saying my kids are 100% the reason why I'm not getting any better and focusing 100% of my work time towards coding and my career in general and being able to do overtime as and when and taking time on the weekend to learn new skills etc.\n\nBut yeah, trying to do any professional job and improve in it whilst raising kids and trying to be a parent, a GOOD parent, whilst being there for sick kids and not being as work and feeling like you are letting the team down.  The fear of the online and offline world judging your every parenting skills and then having the fear of being lambasted because you make 1 mistake out of a million times when your kids usually don't \"misbehave\", its tough.\n\nAll I can say is, yes being a good developer who can code and everything is fantastic to have.  Have you had one to ones with your seniors or bosses recently? One thing that came out of a meeting I had with my boss, when I said I was shocked at how good the new hires were compared to me (3-4 yoe) and my boss remarked that if I felt that way, what the company saw was that I am a really good person to have in meetings, in projects, who could understand the scope needed for a project, who could bridge communication between stakeholders and developers, and people just felt knew that I was like a go to person when there was help needed etc.\n\nIf you can, do your best and find ways and opportunities to develop your coding skills.  Your soft skills from something as simple as communication between teams, don't neglect or underestimate these either, these can also help you stand out as a senior dev or higher",

        "body": "Some companies have a formal process to graduate engineers to senior and beyond as individual technical contributors. But I feel like many go based mostly on feel and perception. If you feel you are stuck and will have a hard time being thought of as senior by your peers because you can't keep up in architecture and design discussions that might hold you back and force you to job hunt.\n\nI agree you should talk to your manager and try to feel out how likely it is you can meet their expectations to stay on assuming you enjoy the work aside from the new hoops they want you to jump through.\n\nI saw some others suggested asking more questions to keep improving your skills. Many people are afraid to ask dumb questions too often as it can make you seem too dependent on the other engineers. But these days honestly you can try talking to an AI about technical details. Most software design and architecture is very well understood and the AI can easily walk you through design questions and help you understand any parts that don't make sense so the next time you have a discussion you are more clear about what is happening.\n\nJust a month back there was a discussion at work explaining a mesh network setup for one of our products. And my networking is super rusty. An hour conversation with the AI and I was following their mesh design much more clearly and asking their team good questions, not the dumb ones where I was unaware of basics or some lingo. Most designs in software aren't super novel or deviant from knowledge the AI has.\n\nThe AIs can still lie so I do recommend double checking it's statements if you are going to put your reputation on the line defending a claim it made. But I feel like there has never been a better tool to help drill down on some \"dumb\" questions we all have.\n\nI will say I am generally perceived as very good at my job and I love software and design discussions. I am totally not immune to feeling stupid or inadequate. Especially on newer projects. Imposter syndrome creeps up on most people unless you have a godly ego. So it's hard to say how you feel really equals no hope of reaching senior in your current role. \n\n Also I don't do side projects. Clearly they are great if you can. But software is just a job and I love my kids more than I love my work. Most people I work with take this stance. I put in extra time to make sure stuff works during crunch time. And I do occasionally enjoy software arch videos on YouTube. But otherwise I enjoy my family and my personal free time. Don't let people make you think you have to give up a decent work life balance.",

        "body": "Hi, I work with a bunch of H1bs at a reputable software engineering company. Keep in mind that my answers are going to be based on visas from a company that does follow the spirit and letter of the law.\n\n  \nThere is not a direct pay gap between H1bs and regular employees who are hired at the same level of experience. However, H1bs have much less _leverage_ to negotiate their position particularly as the years go by. This doesn't necessarily lead to them getting underpaid relative to other employees, but it means that they're more likely to accept worse conditions or volunteer (or be voluntold) for work that they might not have to. This is especially bad for people who have to wait a long time to get a green card.\n\nAdditionally, if you've worked in tech for a while, you'll know that usually the best way to increase your salary is to job hop, and staying at the same company is not typically rewarded- I will get a 7% payrise this year, but I know that if I could switch to another company I'd likely get a 20-30% payrise. It's harder to switch companies as a H1b, so their wages will grow slower than peers in their industry.\n\nCompanies are required to go through certain steps in order to sponsor a H1b to prevent harming the local economy that a worker is being hired into, the LCA. The LCA effectively requires paying the potential employee the higher of the prevailing wage for the area for the job of that employee, or what that employer would pay other employees with similar experience. \n\nSome H1bs do get paid less (but not where I work) because they are a H1b. There are some companies out there that essentially offer you relocation to the US as a job perk and may not pay you well - WITCH companies, mostly. These companies don't have much interest in fair working conditions and will offer relocation to the US to people who I would consider vulnerable, mostly Indians, and will preferentially hire Indians, especially from similar castes as the hiring manager.\n\nAnd, obviously, when you have more people competing for the same position that nominally drives down wages. However, the companies that abuse this system - WITCH companies, again - never intended to hire an American to do the job. An American job is not being displaced by a WITCH company hiring an Indian (although it _is_ still abuse of the H1b system).\n\nSimplistic gut-feeling analyses on \"increasing supply\" affecting wages fall short because they don't take into account a whole bunch of things, not least that a more productive economy with more workers generally leads to more job opportunities in the economy as a whole. As an extremely simplified example, a software shop being set up in a city might prompt a starbucks branch being built nearby to capture the market of higher paid engineers, that might otherwise not exist, which means that the hiring of some engineers (of which some might be H1bs) leads to more tax revenue for the locality as well as more job opportunities, just not _the same_ job opportunities. This is why, in general, immigration is viewed as a positive for the economy",

This isn't a big deal if you're actually an expert with in demand skills because there will likely be other openings. However, if you're just a general software engineer in the current job market, you're going to work more hours or take on extra responsibility to avoid having a 60 day count down to going home.\n\nThe whole premise of the H1B program is to help with situations where we don't have enough qualified people to fill a certain role. When it's used in those situations, it doesn't hurt anybody because H1B holders have enough career mobility to avoid getting underpaid or overworked and US residents won't get pushed out because visa holders are filling a gap, not competing with US workers. If we grant 2000 H1B visas to MDs who want to work in the US, that's fine because we have a shortage of doctors and those visas will benefit the H1B workers without negatively impacting US workers. If we grant 40000 H1B visas to entry level tech workers, which already face high unemployment rates, that not only goes against the goals of the H1B program, it makes the job market worse for all workers involved. Some H1B holders will earn less, some H1B holders will be forced to work under unfair conditions to keep their visa status, supply will exceed demand causing wages to drop, and US workers will have to either accept the unfair conditions or get replaced by an H1B holder who will.\n\nUnder paying H1B visa holders happens at some consulting companies, but even at companies that pay them the same wage as US workers, it's a problem when the system is abused.",

I lack formal education and am in a rural LCOL area. \n\nEspecially reading this sub I have developed even more extreme imposter syndrome and anxiety about losing the job and never finding another tech job bc of competition and industry trends. who knows I could get exited from the industry before I’m fully ready to leave anyway, so I need prepare and plan accordingly\n\nI have personal traits that lead me to burn out, and that’s in any job I will ever have so I need to address that if I’m going to last doing anything. \n\nMy current plan is to stick it out another 7-10 years in tech. If I can do that, without lifestyle creep, I will pay my house off and be 100% debt free and will have been able to sock away a decent bit of cash toward retirement and toward investments I could potentially draw some interest off of. THEN, I can work literally whatever job I want. I will need to bring in some nominal standard income but I could certainly stand to lose my tech level wage. It’s the plan that feels most plausible and future proof both from an industry perspective and just how long I can put up with this career field. Im pretty tired of it \n\nMy advice to fellow burnouts, make a goal and an exit plan. Having the goal for me has been extremely motivating in the short term, and you can always continue working in it after if you have a change of heart. Just know if you exit, weigh the re-entry cost if you think it’s at ALL possible you’d ever want to come back.",

I'm handling a lot of the software architecting/engineering/review and do a fair amount of QA since I have an (limited) inside perspective of what lawyers like/need. Now, as I approach 30 I feel happier than many of my friends in other fields, especially law/medicine where everyone I know seems absolutely fucking miserable. I typically work about 50 hours a week, have ownership in something I believe in, and still have plenty of time to raid on FF14, play tennis, or read. \n\nHowever, many of the people I know in tech also seem happy, and I caution people in the field against assuming the grass will always be greener on the other side. For example, a lot of the complaints people on this Reddit often echo—annoying/incompetent managers, unreasonable deadlines, leadership with no vision, etc.—are present in virtually every industry; I got lucky with the partners and senior associated I worked under in law, but others at my law firm would routinely get screamed at by partners for minor issues.",

These tools are honestly pretty good ( for the right task, don’t lose it on me ) already but the trouble can be trying to use them between systems. That will get easier",

Almost every major fintech has an office here and its the 2nd largest tech hub. It also is the largeast finance hub.  Also NYC the sky is the limit so you can really use this as an oppurtunity to spring board.\n\nIts  very likely you will be making double to tripple what you are currently making within 5 to 8 years.\n\nWhat life style is like in NYC at that salary? 120k in NYC is around  a 6500 month net salary (due to city taxes).\n\n1. If you want to live somewhere fun for singles in their 20s, you would need to eitehr pick between living alone, living somewhere nice with roomates. You'd qualify a miximum of 3k a budget rent and at that price you can live alone. But you have to choose between  living in a nice apartment in jersey/outer areas or in a pre-war shoe box in the nice trendy neighborhood. Nice in NYC is 'mid' in other cities. Its usually means you have a building with some amenities like laundry room or laundry in unit (rarer) and a dishwasher. NYC is a story of under consturction. Most apartments here are 100 years old (prewar) and lack modern conveniences like laundry, dishwasher and central AC. I picked the shoe box, its more fun to be in a good neighborhood if you like to go out and party.\n2. A lot of people your age would choose to live with roomates in order to be  in a nicer apartment in a good location. Generally apartments are a lot mroe cost effective in a 4 bed 2 bath or 3 bed 1 bath situation. If a studio in an apartment building is renting for 4000$, there is a good chance the 3 bed is only 8000$ and the 4 bed is 10,000$. So a very common strategy for young professionals is to just have roomates to live in a nicer apartment in a fun location.\n3. You can afford to live alone and somewher nice, but it would generally be in outer neighborhoods that are either gentrifying or in places like jersey city, a part of New Jersey that is connected by Manhattan via a subway called path.\n\nThe biggest cost in NYC is rent.  Almost all of the cost of living is real estate. That effects things like entertainment and other stuff, because bars/coffee shops/ restaurants and gyms are paying even more per sq feet than you are. But outside of that the cost is the same its not like Amazon charges more here when they are deliving goods to you. Groceries can be all over the map, but trader joes generally is cost effective as they use national price\n\nTo give oyu some idea what prices are like.  Manhattan (you can take off 20 percent for other areas\n\n1. Hair cuts 40 to 75$\n2. Gym depends on which but 50 to 300$. 125 would be mid-tier\n3. Fast Casual lunch  15 to 20$\n4. Street food from a take out only operation  8 to 12$.\n5. Specialty  Coffee from a cafe   (6$ - 7$ before tax)\n6. Dinner at sit down casual restaurant with a waiter  40 to 80$ per person.  You can easily spend 150$ per person at more upscale. This is assuming no alcohol.\n7. Alcohol  6 to 10$ for beer, 10-20$ for wine, 16 to 25$ cocktails. Non-alcoholic options will be offered at most bars.  NYC has a BIG drinking culture. Tech community in particular has a lot of happy hour networking and social events that they host through apps like Luma, Posh VIP, Super Momos, Partiful. So even if you don't drink a whole lot, its in your interest to go to bars and get some non-alocholic drinks.\n8. Ubers 20$ per mile in Manhattan south of 96th street,  10$ per mile in Brooklyn/Queens/Bronx without manhattan entry.\n\nThe other thing thats nice about NYC, because the city is so expensive you won't have pressure to be extravagent which happens in middle cost of living cities. This is a place where people who make 300k a year might live like college students and no one would bat an eye.\n\nTLDR: 120k is a great salary for someone your age in NYC in the fin-tech space. You will ahve enough money to go out quite a bit, save adequately for retirment and you can essentially pick  where you want to live. It is a place where you will need to budget some and not be extravagent, but you can enjoy some luxuries. From a career perspective its also great, the only city that is better for Tech is SF and NYC is good at multiple industries. Fin-Tech space there is always the option of just transitioning into tech roles in finance and NYC is the capital of finance. You can basically live your best life.",

And truth is, most projects don’t need “superstars” but solid, reliable collaboration.\n\nIn our own teams, managers sometimes spot these folks early and take them under their wing.

Far from it. *But*, if the team/company has a culture where that's expected, and you're expected to eat, sleep, and breathe the team, and spend your free time with the team.... yes, that's a legit reason for not extending the contract.

Obviously as a SWE, you deal with all those on a daily basis, but confidently answering 101 + 201 questions are very important in setting the tone for the interview.\n\n  \nwent through my resume bullet points and wrote down about 2 pages per bullet point going deeper in to depth, answering questions like \"how was this metric you put defined?\" \"go a little deeper in the hardest parts of this problem\" \"give a 30 second pitch on how it was implemented\" etc.\n\n  \nHad 1 page written per sample behavior question - \"how do you handle technical disputes - any examples?\" \"how do you normally approach a new technology\". Stuff like that -- not to memorize, just to kind of find the rhythm of your own answer.\n\n  \nFind something non-work related but technical and have it in your back pocket for when someone asks \"and how do you stay on top of technical trends?\" - i found in my interview process there is a big difference between \"I try to find ways to learn on the job\" and \"yeah I'm interested in learning about WASM, I have a couple of data-visualization projects I mess around with when I have time, etc\" and have actually put a few hours in to so you have made at least 1 technical decision you can talk about on it. It doesn't have to be something crazy - just something that shows you aren't a \"in tech for the paycheck\" type of person (which I personally find completely acceptable - but some hiring managers don't)\n\n  \nI have found in my experience that, at least at this midlevel in career, most interviews are just a \"remix\" of stuff you've done in the past -- there is probably enough stuff in your career to mine for experience to be able to handle a system design interview without too much prep -- you just have to sit down before hand and think about all the problems you have done from a bunch of different angles.",

Maybe you've even been around on enough projects to know that if you invest time upfront, you'll be set up for success later when it's a time crunch, so you might work a little more to keep everything nice and clean and documented. \n\n  \nThen, the inevitable comes. Either some requirement changes, or maybe there was a miscommunication - but whatever the case, that nice timeline and architecture you had in your head gets absolutely wrecked. All the time you spent making sure the code was flexible in X, Y, Z directions ends up just being more refactoring, and undoing to get the code into the state it needs to be in to pass unit tests, or meet requirements. Now, it's not about writing good code, you have like X time to do an assignment that should take 2-4x time. You just need to get it done ASAP and ship it. \n\n  \nSometimes you get things cleaned up, but the code looks inflexible, and like it's just duct taped together, which it usually is. Sometimes you don't even get everything cleaned up from what you thought the project was going to be. You do stuff in weird, unintuitive ways, because when you built the framework/foundation, you thought it was going in a different direction, but it's too much effort to rebuild the foundational code from scratch 70% of the way into a project without having to start from scratch.\n\n  \nBut anyway - that's usually how it happens in my experience.

I did not really practice LC - I did a few problems for fun, but in no way would I consider would I did \"grinding\", nor did I make any attempt to memorize the solutions. The 3 LC interviews that I did get were all mediums where I was able to work out non-optimal but reasonable solutions, and I passed the interviews despite my non-optimal solutions.\n\nProbably worth mentioning that the non-LC coding interviews I received by and large still required a strong grasp of CS fundamentals like recursion and proper use of data structures. So if you're not solid with that kind of thing, then practicing LC may still help. I would also not say that the non-LC coding interviews are necessarily easier than LC - just that their difficulty is more about turning complex requirements into code than about figuring out \"this one neat trick\", which I do think is a more fair type of difficulty and more reflective of job skills. Also I did not interview with any FAANG companies, and I think they are more notorious for having LC interviews.\n\nThe vast majority of my interview prep time was spent on practicing systems design and fleshing out my behavioral interview stories, and personally I thought that was a much better use of my time than grinding LC (as a senior candidate).",

I don't need (or want) to live in a big, spacious, luxurious condo, I'd be comfortable and content in a 1br place that's in a location I really like.\n\nI do expect to make more at each successive job in my future but I don't have a target in mind for salary, I just want an opportunity that'll let me live comfortably in a place I really like and enjoy all that with a good work life balance.\n\nI'm 25, and I get that in this job market you have to work a lot harder even during your undergrad. I worked hard for my internships and all the work I did afterward to get to where I am, but I don't want to dedicate my entire life to just working and grinding. I already worked hard enough to land these jobs and internships.\n\nYouth is a short, fleeting, temporary thing and I don't want to spend all my youth obsessively grinding in pursuit of the prospect of wealth, luxury, and prestige. I just want to live a happy, comfortable life with a job that allows me to do that.\n\nThere's so much more to life than just wealth, prestige, and grinding. Live comfortably.",

She actually makes it look very good. \n\nThen it linked leetcode study guides that included practice questions to better udnerstand how to code it. Honestly was a great study guide, not sure why they took it out. \n\nThe videos are still there write in youtube \"hacker rank data structures\". Here is one of them: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njTh\\_OwMljA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njTh_OwMljA) \n\nIn my opinion do not fall into the \"grind leetcode for 200 hours\". You might get a job that way, but i have found many interviewers can tell when you dont understand the problem and are just copying what similar leetcode problems did. Because they dont mind changing up the problem halfway through if they noticed you got there too quickly. They'll change one little thing in the problem and ask you to re-do it and the way you did it wont work. So there is a lot of having to understand DSA to get the job. \n\nLearn how to think outloud because that's what most of them expect. They dont care if you get it right, just how you think. Ive gotten jobs and havent gottent their questions right. \n\nAlso, tackle problems piece by piece. I have found that once i write one line of code, i am less stressed and tackle the problem better. So usually the first thing i do is tackle the base cases. Let's say I have to re-arrange an array. First line i write is \"if(array.empty())\". Then i tackle the next base case and i ahve found that once you go through it the asnwer kind of starts resolving itself as you tackle the base cases.",

Like… if they are asking for someone who knows PostgreSQL, but your resume just says ‘SQL’ because you’ve used various SQL distributions, good luck…\n\n2. Over qualified/willing to work for 30% less than a few years back. I can’t even get a callback from basic analytics roles after 5+ years doing Data Science and advanced analytics. Asking for enough cash to scrape by without roommates? Insta-DQ’d cause that conservative 20% lower than your last two jobs number you put in the requested salary box was too high..\n\n\nIdk, if I had time, maybe I’d get a certification on cloud technologies and DBT + Airflow. Like every job ‘Needs’ that now. No chance you just learn some basic GUI tools on the job now. It’s the differentiator between ‘Maybe getting an interview’ and no chance.",

I got burnt out and quit my first and only SWE with 3 years of experience and I've been unable to land another position for 2 years now. Most of the first year was my \"fault\". I was burnt out and did not want to spend time studying and interview prepping. I wanted to relax and travel a bit. Well that decision is still affecting me now. \n\nI've gotten close a few times, but didn't get the offer. Now I think the career gap is hurting me more than anything. Granted I was not in a tech hub like Seattle is. Go to some in person events and network a bit before you commit to leaving your company. Build up a small network if you can. And as for burn out, taking time off and relaxing helps some but really therapy has been amazing for me. There are therapists that specialize in whatever types of issues you are having like work stress, adhd, isolation, etc. If you've never done therapy before and want to know more about how to get started on that just message me. I started in my second year of unemployment when really I should have signed up as soon as I quit my job, probably even before that",

        "body": "Decided to apply for jobs. Very different experience from u/[IAmBoredAsHell](https://www.reddit.com/user/IAmBoredAsHell/)\n\nKeep in mind I have an Ivy League undergrad degree (Columbia Univ) so that might have helped.\n\nApplied for jobs. Heard back from many places. LinkedIn claims I applied 28 places (many of which are the same companies like 6 on Roblox, etc). So 15 different companies for the 28 positions. + outside LinkedIn like DataDog, Coinbase.\n\nOut of the 15+2 companies, had recruiter calls from 13 companies. The 4 companies that did not reply were Roblox (sucks cause I got interview there before), Affirm (sucks cause I got interview there before), ~~MongoDB (my experience is completely irrelevant to work there)~~, Pinterest (sucks cause I got interview there before), DataDog (my experience is completely irrelevant to work there).\n\nIn my inbox, have many dozens of recruiters requesting to do an interview. Many well paying desperate firms like Carta, Decagon, Vanta, Valon, TikTok, Meta, DE Shaw, Stubhub, Lyft, Anduril, DoorDash, Ramp, Amazon, etc. And crap ton of AI grift startups/firms which constantly clog up my inbox daily.\n\nI got rejected from OpenAI at phone screen this time but I blame the interviewer. System design question was infra side when I have zero understanding of infra. Sucks because I was able to get an offer almost 2 years ago there but thought non-profit + Scam Altman == shares are worth nothing + don't want to deal with insane work hours. Who knew valuations would explode and non-profits become for-profits so easily. I thought Elon Musk would have done something there.\n\nIt's honestly very difficult from the start to even apply as senior because most jobs are not going to be on the field I work in.\n\nIn the fields I work in, I get basically 100% response rate. Since I work in the financial side, so jobs like Uber for Financial team, trading firms (absolutely 0 thoughts), etc all respond quick. Pigeonhole life :/. Honestly not interested in the WLB and have no thoughts moving to NYC when I have made my life here right now (maybe in the future).\n\nI'm sure if I spray and prayed full stack, infra, databases, etc. roles then my response rate would be garbage as well. But then again, I'm sure if I applied mid level roles for those I would get calls left and right but then why would I?\n\nAnd no. I don't bother with referrals, connections, etc. Not my thing. Never needed to. I was able to get interviews at Netflix, Google, OpenAI, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Snap, Databricks, Citadel, etc in the past without any problems anyway. Ivy League degree helps.\n\nDefinitely worse than covid era. During covid era, I essentially had 90% response rate at tech firms and near 100% response rate at non tech firms. But then again, I'm not applying for mid level roles so to be expected. Plus, I am a lazy individual who has no thoughts min-maxing my career so that plays a part as well. I've let my experience rot my skills for job market but I don't care. I value life outside work a lot.\n\n>Curious if there are any suggestions or comments on day to day learning and interview prep?\n\nJust take life chill. Don't overthink. Life is too short to stress these stuff too much.\n\nThat said, be good at Leetcode. Try to aim for 95% pass rate on coding interviews.\n\nAnd spend time on studying System Design. That's the most important once you are out of new grad.\n\n\\-\n\nUpdate: MongoDB just replied to start process. Perfect timing. LOL. But I won't be starting the process anyways.",

The manager then uses that unused budget to justify extra contractor hours, better SaaS tools, or training.\n Sometimes it’s less shady and more “use it or lose it”, if you don’t spend that budget this year, finance cuts it next year, so managers scramble to redirect it.\n Bonuses are usually harder, because comp budgets are separate. But perks like team offsites, conference travel, or new laptops?

I wasn't thinking about the money.\n\nOne big difference about my approach, and the approach I see a lot of people on this subreddit taking is I chose the degree *first*, not my job.\n\nA lot of people here decide they want to be a SWE first, and then work backwards to a CS degree. This hyper-focuses their career path and job search, which can make it significantly more difficult. Especially early career where they may not land their ideal role right away, and because they worked backwards from their ideal role, they view it as a failure and get depressed, and give up.\n\nWhereas with me, I would've been happy with *any* job remotely in technology. I would've been *totally fine* with help desk. When I was in college I was applying to every internship under the sun. IT, Help Desk, PM, SysAdmin, QA, whatever. If it was tech-related, I applied. Since I didn't have tunnel-vision on any specific role, this gave me flexibility. I couldn't get a SWE internship after my sophomore year, but I did get an offer for a PM internship. As a new grad, I only had 1 SWE offer, and that came pretty late. But I *did* have backups. A return offer from my PM internship, other IT offers, etc. If that late SWE offer never came, I was totally prepared to take one of those other offers, and been completely content with it. I got my CS degree, and I got a job out of it. Goal met. It's much easier to meet a goal like that than it is \"SWE at FAANG\".",

That means your résumé was flagged as a potential match for one of the positions they’re actively trying to fill. In other words, this isn’t random. Take the 15 minutes.\n\nIt’s also important to clear up a common misconception: a job being posted on a careers site does not *always* mean it’s actively open for hire. Likewise, a role can be open and available to fill even if it isn’t posted publicly.\n\nThink of a job posting like a flyer on a bulletin board. If someone was already hired but the recruiter forgot to take the flyer down, it can look like “there was never a real job.” \n\nOn the flip side, if the recruiter is hiring but chooses not to hang a flyer, it doesn’t mean they aren’t hiring—it just means the posting isn’t public. \n\nWhat truly matters is whether the *requisition* is open and approved as a **headcount**. That’s what determines if someone can be hired.\n\nP.S. Internal recruiters for Microsoft are not paid on commission. They are salaried full time employees, or hourly contractors. Their comp is not determined by number of candidates, though they do have metrics to adhere to.",

That’s not to say it would necessarily hurt your career to go with Grainger, though—you’ve shown that you can get multiple offers already! \n\nVisa’s ladder is pretty strict from what I experienced in that most people follow similar promotion timelines regardless of performance.\n\nThe savings from living with your parents would definitely put a decent dent over the comp at Visa (rent would probably be anywhere from $12,000-30,000 post tax depending on roommates, quality of apartment, etc.)",

I don't really consider Chicago to be much of a tech city. If it was, housing would be considerably more expensive. Most of the tech work in the area is tied to finance, consulting, pharma and other corporate flavors. While some tech companies have a presence, it's noticeably smaller. \n\nA 1.5 hour commute will be brutal. \n\nI worked at a company that did consulting work for Grainger, but I never worked on a project for them. I got the impression their tech was kind of weak. A lot of other companies in that area (far north suburbs, I believe) are dominated by Indian dev teams and management - both local and offshore. The horror stories you read on this sub where an Indian manager comes in and the entire tech team becomes Indian is a big problem with a lot of companies in that area. I can't speak to Grainger, specifically, so you should ask around and try to find more info. I suppose the possibilities of this will be pretty high at Visa, too.",

The downside is it makes the process exhausting and slow for candidates even when you’re already experienced. For UI/UX, employers judge more by portfolios and past projects.

Their work speaks for itself, and companies don’t always add as many hoops for design roles. \n\nIt’s not really that one career is easier than the other, it’s just that the hiring culture is different.

My coworkers don't even know what it is. I never got design interviews at entry level but I do now and 50% have no coding at all.\n\nIf I get a job, it's because I interviewed well. Questions went my way, I sounded smart and interested in the position and knew the tech stack and didn't need training. My personality meshed with the team culture. I would fit in. That's not usually the case.\n\nYou don't need high skill, you just need average skill. I got a job offer in banking with below 500 out of 600 on the CodeSignal exam. Was just pass/fail, over-passing did nothing. The design question with no coding, I kicked ass thanks to my past work experience in a similar situation.\n\nLuck is always a factor. I got a job once by looking in the room, seeing an equestrian picture, the interviewer said she rode horses, we talked about horse riding for 45 minutes.

You're not just writing one application so on paper you're more than one person others are competing for that position. Let's take a hypothetical scenario where there are 50 people looking for a job and there are 50 positions open. Everyone applied to every position. On paper this means you are competing with 49 other people but just because you aren't the best in those 50 people doesn't mean there is no job for you. Of course this is a scenario where demand and supply is equal but even if you are the exact median, the demand would have to be more than twice the supply for you to be left out.

Turn resume bullets into results with numbers, keep it clean and scannable, link to a live demo and PRs. That’s what pulls you out of the pile. You’re not trying to be perfect for everyone, just undeniable for a few.\n\nFor interviews, aim for above-bar consistency, not brilliance. Do 45-60 minutes a day on a tight set of patterns until mediums feel routine, and talk through problems with a simple loop - clarify constraints, propose baseline, optimize, test - recording yourself to fix pacing and signal. For systems design, use a repeatable template and practice one scenario a day. Ditch spray-and-pray: send concise, specific cold emails to engineers and hiring managers at focused targets, reference a pain they have, share a tiny artifact or plan, ask for a quick chat, then the referral; say yes to contract-to-hire or smaller teams to get momentum.

Tech can be crazy like that.\n\nA few points:\n\n1) Knowing your shit matters vastly more than a piece of paper pretending to attest to that.\n\n2) Personality matters, a *lot*.  People like to work with people they like to work with.  This is where a *lot* of tech folks get tripped up: They vastly overweight the importance of their tech skills and all but completely dismiss interpersonal relationship skills.  No one cares if you're the best coder on the team if you're an asshole.  It's often shorthanded as \"networking\" or \"soft\" skills, but really it's just about being that likable guy at the party.  You don't have to be the life of the party (probably not even a good idea), but you do need to at least be getting invited to the parties.\n\n3) Integrity matters, a *lot.*  Sell your accomplishments sure, but experienced IT folks have a very attuned bullshit meter.  Be forthright, accurate, specific, *humble.*  If you did X and Jack handled Y, don't try and BS when interviewing about how X was all you.  When you screw up, as we *all* do, step up and take responsibility before anyone even thinks to ask.  How you *respond* to failures is vastly more important than your rate of failure. -Some of my most engaging stories to pull out for interviews focus around what I did to recover from mistakes.\n\nRemember that anyone hiring you is agreeing to spending *almost half their waking hours* with you for the foreseeable future.

After 8 years, I don’t feel like it matters nearly as much. \n\nThere’s definitely still jobs that won’t even look at my resume without an advanced degree. But tbh, those jobs probably still wouldn’t look at me with a Masters, they pay super well and can afford to hire just PhD’s.\n\nI think if you want to get into management or entrepreneurship, something like an MBA at a good school where you can network with people who have similar goals or mindsets could be worth it. But if you still want to be on the technical path, Idk I just feel like the time and money you’d have to spend getting the Masters could be spent doing other stuff that might have a bigger impact on career trajectory. Like, for maybe 1/10th the time and money, could you make a point of going to 1 or 2 meetups or conferences related to the jobs you want, and just aggressively network, and get to know everyone in the field so when opportunities pop up, you’ll know people who can help you get those jobs/opportunities?\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, I think the AI wave/hype is largely dying out. I don’t see the Data Science jobs paying any more than software/data/architecture jobs. In fact a trend I’ve seen recently is, a lot of times the Data Engineering positions are paying more money than the DS positions. I think if you want to switch careers for fulfillment or job satisfaction, getting a Masters could put you in a good spot to secure a job like that, which would otherwise be hard to land without job experience.

If your raise percentagewise is less then what they got based on your performance and their performance, you should honestly keep your head down and look to maneuver away at your second year.",

Say, you get an increase becase of an external job offer. How will the company trust you are not going to look again externally to use as leverage? it just doesn't look good on you and doesn't scale.\n\n2. Your manager's reasoning for lack of promotion *\"it just doesn't happen after 1 year\"* is very poor. Each individual performs uniquely. They have to advocate for you when trying to promote you, so if their logic just falls into \"it's not usually how it's done here\", there's no spine. What could you have done better? What's the company state wrt promotions right now? Is there something you're missing? That would be helpful feedback. FYI, sure you need a great relationship with your manager, but also consider skip manager, you want leadership visibility and to have them on your side.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to \"negotiate\" annual rise. If your goal is to get promoted, you need to hunt it down, advocate for your, and convince with results to leadership/team that you deserve it. If your goal is salary increase, jump to another company.",

FEED, as I understand it, is simply a very thorough form of project planning done prior to beginning implementation/providing a quote. It's not *specific* to those things you listed. Those were just examples. \"Project Scope\" is the important bit of that section, along with timeline, quotes, project organization, etc.\n\nEspecially if the company you applied to builds things for customers, and bids on projects, rather than building/running their own product, it seems pretty reasonable that they would be legitimately doing FEED, and the SWE's would be heavily involved since it's a software project they're planning/selling.\n\nI have 12 YOE, and I don't recall ever hearing that acronym before... but there's lots of acronyms I haven't heard of. There is a ton of variety in the industry. After looking up what FEED is, I can safely say I've never been involved in such a rigid and thorough project planning stage. I've worked mostly in agile shops where we're fast and loose with timelines, planning, and costs. Joining a company where their planning stage can potentially last months, *or years*, would certainly be a new experience to me. So it's good that they made it clear on the job posting that that's the project planning methodology they follow, because that's a pretty major culture indicator.",

        "body": "It takes as long as it takes. Some folks land another job fairly quickly, others it'll take months.\n\nThe biggest thing you're up against at the moment is the calendar. Lots of places slow down hiring as the year draws to a close. I was laid off in mid-October last year and told my wife if I didn't land something by Thanksgiving then it likely dry up until mid- to late January. Fortunately I landed something in November.\n\nIt sucks losing your job, and if I recall from your previous post this is your first time going through this. I experienced being laid off at my first job after graduating, only being there about six months. Felt like an absolute failure, especially to my parents because I was still living at home. They were very understanding and mainly just felt bad for me, but we're happy to let me live with them as long as I was hunting for another job. Lots of folks will be more understanding than you realize, and for the ones who don't or seem to pull away I'd say you'll learn the \"value\" of those relationships.\n\nThe best advice I can give you would be:\n\n1) Realize it's very likely not your fault and simply a business decision. This is not a reflection on you as a person or on your skills as much as you may think it is. You now know that most employers don't really value you or others as much as you may have thought.\n\n2) If there are local user groups for your field of study, attend those and network as much as possible. I've been able to keep my recent stints with layoffs fairly short due to the network I've built over the years. Talking with folks and getting their help in applying for open positions is gonna do more for you than online submissions where you're a name among hundreds or thousands of others. I landed my current position by going to a local user group and connecting with a staff engineer of the company hosting it, who was willing to submit my resume directly to HR for an open position.\n\n3) In the current market, you may need to be more open to both returning to an office to work and even taking short term contract gigs. Fully in office positions will likely have fewer applicants compared to hybrid, and both will have fewer applicants compared to fully remote. Taking contract work can also be an option, as most times those interview loops are one or two rounds and often not that involved. Part of this is because they can cut you loose at any moment and owe you nothing, because you likely won't have paid time off (you can take time off, just not paid). Benefits, if offered, can usually be stupid expensive depending on your needs, but contract work will almost always pay far better than unemployment, and keeps long gaps off your resume. It may lead to a permanent position, and if not then at least you avoid dipping into your savings for a while. You can absolutely keep interviewing for better gigs in the meantime.\n\n4) If needed, take part-time work somewhere or work in something adjacent to your field of study if possible. I floated by on support and sys admin type roles for about three years, from 2009 to 2012, because I was a new grad with minimal experience losing out on jobs to folks who had that experience. I managed to stay close to the industry and make decent money from it while waiting for my time to get back into SWE jobs in full.\n\nI get it man, losing a job sucks and is a big hit to your mental. Know that you're not the first to experience this, you won't be the last, and this may not be your last time experiencing it. There's gonna be aspects of paranoia about it happening again going forward and you just gotta learn how to deal with it. The best way to deal with it is to build both a solid amount of savings, along with a solid network of folks you can reach out to if it ever happens again.\n\nYou'll get through this, and you'll be stronger for it.",

Companies in those countries still want to see proof you can do the work so your best bet is to keep building strong projects, maybe earn one or two big cloud/devops certs (like AWS or Azure), and make your LinkedIn/GitHub shine. When you graduate, you’ll stand out to employers. Studying abroad is also expensive, and if you don’t land a job in that window, it can feel like wasted money. But tech roles are still in demand in those countries, especially cloud, backend, and DevOps. If you’re serious and willing to network, apply early, and show your skills, you have a very real shot. So studying abroad can be a good path if you see it as both education and a bridge into that country’s job market.

        "body": "The Computer Science MSc is usually seen as the more prestigious option because it’s broad and shows you’ve done advanced work in algorithms, systems, and AI. Employers in tech and finance especially recognize it. Since it already has stats and machine learning modules, it gives you a good mix of theory and practical skills that you could apply to data science later. The downside is that you might feel like you’re spending a lot of time on modules you’re not passionate about if they aren’t data focused.\n\nThe Statistics & Data Science MSc is more specialized. It shows that you’re committed to a career in data and analytics. This can help you stand out if you’re going straight for data scientist, data analyst, or data consultant roles. But data science is competitive as many people enter with a PhD or years of experience. So, with just a master’s, you’d want to build a strong portfolio of projects, maybe internships, and show you can apply your learning to real world problems.\n\nIf you want maximum flexibility and aren’t 100% sure whether you’ll go into pure data or something adjacent, stick with Computer Science. If you’re confident you want data focused roles and want your degree title to reflect that directly, then go with Statistics & Data Science. Since you’re also open to more human facing roles like data consultant, either degree could work. Employers will usually care less about the exact title and more about your ability to explain data clearly, work with stakeholders, and use tools like Python, SQL, and visualization platforms.

I would say after you have a good resume (hopefully after this recent change taking his advice along with formatting it to be 1 page) it may take a while to get an opportunity but just keep applying, eventually stuff stacks up fast especially if your highlight your language specific experience for a role that it’s critical for.
