I also started narrating my thought process out loud during practice to get comfortable talking through my approach. Have you tried platforms like interview query? They have some DE-specific practice problems that are more relevant than generic LeetCode, plus they offer peer mock interviews where you can practice the communication part. Sometimes just getting comfortable with the interview format is half the battle. Don't beat yourself up - these interviews are rarely representative of the actual job!",

A good interviewer will work with you if you get stuck when solving these problems, and on top of that they should understand that you're under pressure and might not be operating at your best.

Just a few important ones to know.\n\nLearning is a key component of being a data engineer. The data landscape is changing constantly and more and more tools are growing to do similar things. But the industry is also getting more and more professional. It is key to understand cloud computing, auto scaling and being able to build and act upon proper monitoring, if you want to call yourself a senior at some point.",

More chances than not, you will not have spaces to develop something ground breaking, but rather tweaks on existing code or some fixes. \n\nI think one of the keys of professional success is learning to make lemonade with the lemons you're given, and it applies specially to feeling stuck. Most of the times, people that break through are people who learned something new, a new trick, or those who trained themselves on their own time, to learn to cook with better ingredients.\n\nIt seems to me your best bet would be finding a healthy work place, and then finding self projects. A lot of times you really need to dig deep into what you want to learn, find the path to get there, and walk every step along the way.\n\nIn other words, it often comes down to never beating yourself up. Instead, it might be from knowing yourself well enough to HAVE to learn on your own pace and with less pressure. My impression is that the pressure comes mostly from being forced to do things on the job that you're not that familiar with. \n\nFinding a solid ground comes from finding a place that will take you as you are, give fair compensation, and you show your true self and what you know. It never does well to try and be something/someone you aren't, force it, and set yourself to crash and burn.",

Talk to your new hire and let him know you want to start with him but build a team under / around him in the coming years. Take that promise seriously, and build a vision together.

Help them get clean data regularly and they will have much less roadblocks.

I also think hiring teams, for various reasons, are sometimes not equipped to relate the core concepts of data engineering over their own, so instead they feel more comfortable talking to candidates who have experience in their specific toolset.\n\nThe skill I'm trying to build right now in my own interviews is assessing, understanding, and directly addressing any concerns a prospective employer might have about my skillset and my suitability to the job. You have to learn to speak the language they speak.\n\nIn the future I'd try to give more options during interviews to the interviewers on how they want to proceed. If they want to see a project you are familiar with, pull up your notes. If they want to focus on your experience with their tools, follow up with clarifying questions about your scope and then propose a solution -- or even just relate how your experience applies to solving that particular problem.\n\nHope that helps some.

What I’m seeing is what agile was supposed to be has devolved into an employee monitoring system. We do scrums but it’s only a way to track what we do and use it in performance evaluations. The last three companies I’ve been in started out with high expectations then managers got the bright idea to use it to their advantage to monitor everything",

        "body": "A Tool cannot solve a Social Problem.\n\nIf you have a healthy business / engineering relationship, then Jira (or any sufficently mature process-management tool) is great. When that relationship is not healthy, then tools, KPIs, approval committees become weights around everyones neck.\n\nIf you feel that Jira is in your way, it is probably because there is something disfunctional in how the product and technical objectives are being vetted by your leadership. This vetting is fundamentally a value judgment based on how well those people get along and share a common objectives for the business as a whole.\n\nI have built software and teams in a variety of industries, lead over a dozen engineering teams from technical lead to executive management. Tools like Jira work well when the leadership (both business *and* technical) have good communication and a respect for each others goals. When either side is instead trying to dominate the other with their agenda, (whether its the Business team trying to chase every shiny new customer regardless of the ROI, or the Technical team trying to chase every new shiny new technology framework regardless of the ROI) a tool like Jira becomes a hammer that one side uses to \"force\" the other into submission or a shield to \"prove\" the other side is out of their mind.\n\nI often come into new teams in chaos. They have over-provisioned their Jira workflows in an attempt to track or prove the amount of work being done. The first step is to always get the team to a \"win\". That usually means stripping the process down to its fundamentals: what is the prioritized list and when do we need to get it out. Once you guide everyone through a cycle successfully with simple criteria, then you can do a real retrospective and ask \"how can we do better\" and adjust your tools/process accordingly.\n\nThat first \"win\" is important, it gives people hope that things can actually get better and gets them to think positively about change instead of rejecting all suggestions out of hand.",

And not fall in love with the tool and its metrics to where you’re forever messing with jira and not doing the work.  \n\nGood management is key here.  Some managers fall too in love with the tool and have devs doing a bunch of work just to keep tickets updated.  Some make way too many tasks to where stuff is too granular.  And try to literally account for every minute and plan down to the second. \n\nOthers don’t know how to break up work into tickets that are right sized.   Or over think that part of it.  \n\nI’ve worked on teams with both extremes.  My old job, my director was under pressure to show the team was successful by using metrics.  So we spent tons of time on jira crap.  And the CFO never even looked at it and just made decisions about IT by vibe anyways.  \n\nNow I’m an independent contractor.  And one of my long term engagements has a manager who underestimates the complexity of everything.  He actually thinks it’s reasonable to have 1 ticket that’s “build entire warehouse and BI solution for client X” basically.  And always tells them “6 weeks” or something ridiculous despite me looking at the requirements and thinking “oh this one is gonna be a pain”.  \n\nSo in short it’s not the size of the ticketing tool it’s how you use it.",

If you haven't ever had a non-office job and have to be on-site all of the time, you have no idea how OP the option of not commuting is.\n\n* Get paid well to do relatively little.  Respectfully, there are much harder jobs mentally and physically with much higher barriers to entry which pay A LOT less.  Not being poor is pretty awesome. I say that as somebody who doubled their salary in the space of two years and really feel the difference.  This would have been impossible in my old job.\n\n* Reasonably low barrier to entry.  You don't see many self taught lawyers, doctors, nuclear physicists etc.  The idea of the self taught programmer going from zero to hero is absolutely still a thing.\n\n* Personally, I get a lot of job satisfaction.  Yeah, sometimes I build shit and send it out into the void although I have a lot of fun creating processes which work.  Even if nobody comes up to me and says it's amazing, I'm just the kind of person that appreciates things which are well designed (sometimes, these happen to also be things I have built).\n\nCons (some not exclusive to DE):\n\n* Inheriting work and working with people who don't follow process.  This is annoying in most technical fields although that annoyance gets amplified 100x in software and data because that shits affects so much other stuff.\n\n* In my experience, a lot of people who have been in tech and IT for a while really hate change even if it's for the better.  I'd understand people being resistant to change if somebody came in and said they should rewrite their entire working codebase into a different language, although a lot of people hate learning new stuff such as source control and CI/CD.  Again, personal experience, although these people are usually those who have been in the same place for 20+ years, won't get sacked anytime soon, and have fallen behind but have no incentive to catch up.  Unfortunately, this also makes them senior, so they suppress everybody else by extension.",

Having something which can run on very lightweight iot devices, processing sensor data in real time while having a small impact on battery life could be a pretty decently marketable thing. \n\nNot sure if that fits into your audience at all, but that could be a nifty little niche I think.",

Learning each keyword in SQL for data engineering is like saying you want to learn carpentry so you’re going to learn what a hammer does, when to use a router and when to use a lathe. \n\nKnowing what something is and when to use it is usually easy to pick up as you go. Process is much more important to learn. Pick a problem (How have various presidencies affected various macro-economic KPIs). Then start by determining what data goes into those KPIs. Then find a way to get that data from a government or other API. Process the data into normalized tables. Then finally make a nice dashboard with the data and draw a conclusion. Finally set up some automation to updated your dataset monthly. Make sure new data is getting appended and you’re not overwriting old data. Ensure you’re not duplicating data. You get the idea. Process > Tools. \n\nYou could probably go years in your career without touching the S or A or even B tier in your chart as a Junior. And that’s ok. Same way a trainee carpenter won’t be using a lathe to shape a table leg. So there’s no need for him to understand what a lathe does from day 1.",

You can do it via a technical path, a management path, etc. Almost all ways of moving up will move you farther and farther away from day to day coding. In order to be considered for these type of positions, you need to start developing skills for them. Most of them don't come naturally and are often hard for people who are really into the weeds.\n\nWant to move up to an architect? Architects only code enough to prove out concepts and ideas that will work on a design. When I have had people come up to me to ask about becoming an architect, the first question to them is, \"Are you ready to give up coding?\" Not because they won't have to, but I am looking to see if their head is in a space for the next steps. Architects have one foot in the business world and one in the tech world. The two worlds are very, very different.\n\nHone your people skills. No matter how you move up, you will need them and they can always be better. You will have to start listening for business requirements (both stated and implied) and figure out not only what they are saying but the right patterns to pass down for the coders to implement. It is hard because the sirens in the weeds will always be there calling you back. You have to fight them. Every time you think, \"I could do this faster myself\" you need to STOP. \n\nNext level up is changing your tools. Your tools are no longer software on hardware but the software inside people's head. You need to learn how to communicate what you want done to other people. Unlike the hardware you are used to, sometimes you may need to do it multiple times to get what you want. You also have to make your people (tools) better. I think that is an obligations more senior people have to the newer ones. The trick is how to do it without being a dick.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.",

About 5-6 years later after I went to university (a few years after I graduated), the requirement for pharmacists steeply declined.\n\nOpposite story: when I was trying to become a DE, I watched a video from a popular YouTuber who described DEs as \"second class citizens\" and \"SQL monkeys\" in the data space.  I chose to not listen to that person and carried on anyway because I really enjoyed DE.

There is also just much more of a cookie cutter nature to analyst work than DE, which is where LLMs excel. Asking ChatGPT to make you a streamlit dashboard with some “insights” on a dataset, vs asking it to solve complex Spark efficiency issues, you can see the difference already today.

You think a data analyst has any serious knowledge of database administration, networking, web applications, systems administration, cloud operations?\n\n> In addition to the rise of AI tools and automation\n\nThey don't replace any of the fundamental work of a data engineer: providing end to end data solutions.\n\n> Am I making a risky choice by specializing in this area\n\nYou cannot specialize in this area yet because you have no technical skills, no work experience, no domain knowledge of any business kind whether it be finance, healthcare, communications, research, biology, whatever. \n\nYou are like a kid playing with a BB gun who is asking the grown ups if specializing to get into the covert operations special unit is a good choice. Maybe start by joining the army first.\n\nYour questions are fundamentally flawed because you have no knowledge or understanding of what a data engineer does. Thinking that a business or data analyst can replace a data engineer shows how little understanding you hold, and perhaps should start asking experienced engineers what the role consists of and what knowledge is required first, before making assumptions and looking like a fool.",

The idea is to simplify the data stack, instead of having separate tools for each of these tasks.\n\n\n\nSome highlights:\n\n• **Powerful built-in Data Quality & Observability**: Native data profiling, no-code tests, and real-time alerts out-of-the-box.\n\n• **Strong Collaboration & Governance**: Business glossary integration, tagging, sensitive data classification, and clear ownership assignments help everyone stay aligned.\n\n• **Column-level Lineage**: Easily visualize your data pipelines down to individual columns, making debugging and root cause analysis straightforward.\n\n• **API-first design**: Everything is built around open APIs, and we offer SDKs too, making integrations and automations super easy.\n\n• **90+ connectors**: Quickly bring metadata from your sources into OpenMetadata with just a click through the UI, or schedule it your way (Airflow, Dagster, etc.).\n\n• **Easy, lightweight deployment**: All you need are containers for the OpenMetadata server, MySQL/Postgres, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, and a scheduler. Deploys easily on Kubernetes.\n\n\n\nWe’ve also got an active Slack community and thorough documentation to help you get started. If you want to quickly check it out, we have a sandbox available too—no setup needed.\n\n\n\n• [**Sandbox Environment**](https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/)**:** Hands-on experience with no setup required.\n\n• [**Docs & How-To Guides**](https://docs.open-metadata.org/latest/how-to-guides)\n\n• [**Active Slack Community**](http://slack.open-metadata.org/): Super responsive for any questions or support.",

        "body": "The “why” is a little complicated, but it basically comes down to how python works vs Spark. \n\nPySpark is just an API for Spark, which is a Java application that runs on clusters of nodes (different computers on the same network). When the cluster saves a file, it splits it up into parts processed on each node, but then the nodes need to know where to send the data. The DBFS isn’t  on the node, it’s on some other computer. So each node needs an address (like a url) to know where to send it. It’s all comes down to spark being designed for moving data over a network.\n\nDatabricks was built off of ipykernal which used classic file system. When classic python code is run, it runs on the driver, which has the DBFS mounted (like how a usb drive or shared drive is mounted) so the reference it, you just need the file location like you’d write if you ran it on your laptop.\n\nAnd fwiw, each node doesn’t mount DBFS because it would be a massive pain for several reasons.",

        "body": "As others have mentioned, but explained perhaps a little differently: The `/dbfs` is a file path on the OS on the driver node that your notebook is running on. Your python session can read that path as it usually can any path on the OS you have access to, and anything running in your python session - like pandas - has to use that path.\n\nUsing `dbfs:/` with a python library like pandas would be like asking pandas to open `ftp:/` or `http:/` -- it is dependent on the library to know how to use the protocol to go fetch the data. For example with the requests library you can do calls to `http:/`\n\nSpark - which you access through the pyspark API - understand `dbfs:/` so it can use that path. More than that though, the `/dbfs` path does not necessarily exist on the workers in your cluster, so sending that path out to the workers is pointless. You can't access it via workers because it isn't a local file path, and exposing it as if it were a local file path to multiple machines may confuse some users into treating it like a local file path.",

You can kick the tires for free at [https://app.gizmodata.com](https://app.gizmodata.com) \\- where I've loaded a 1TB dataset for folks to query and gauge performance, you just have to register to try it out.\n\nFull disclosure - I'm the founder of GizmoData - the maker of GizmoSQL.  Base DuckDB can work fine for you if you want to run it locally, or write your own API on top of it (or use dbt, for example)...",

I’m sure there are others, just can’t think of them right now \n\nIf you’re aiming for FAANG, expect a mix of high-level architecture + digging into bottlenecks or trade-offs. The usual system design stuff still applies, so don’t skip it - just tailor it to data workloads. Hope it helps",

(Even though it’s on the dbt site, it’s the best article I’ve found that covers the topic and is free) https://www.getdbt.com/blog/data-product-data-as-product \n\n2. What’s your data modeling understanding? If you aren’t sure what I mean by that, check out https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/\n\n3. I’m guessing with DevOps you continuing working in the cloud, but have you worked with the data-centric services? If not, I’d explore the free tiers and get hands on. \n\n4. Some of the most common languages (in order of importance) are SQL, Python, and shell scripting. SQL will always be the most importantly but sometimes you just need Python and shell scripting is always super useful.\n\n5. Being that orchestration is a big part of Data Engineering, I’d check out Airflow if you haven’t already because it is the most commonly adopted orchestrator. I prefer Dagster but don’t see many job  reqs calling it out. Regardless, the important bit is understanding why DAGs are so useful and that can translate into any tool.\n\n\nThat’s a solid start (and I apologize if this list itself is overwhelming). I always tell folks I’m mentoring to start at 1 (wrap your head around data products) as it is a good mindset shift and then just pick any of the other areas and focus on that.",

        "body": "> I find a developer easier and if I find him he most probably knows a lot about modelling\n\nOnly applies to some organisations. I've been in some where everyone come up through a more traditional analyst pathway on SQL databases, and they had absolutely no concept version control, or version control, or literally anything other than SQL. Sure, you can find these people and grab them if that's all you need.\n\nOther organisations however may be more oriented around their own internal technology, and may have more SWE around the place. In that case finding developers that can work in something like Python will be a lot easier, and they'll be a lot more used to writing code that can be run and tested locally, and they'll be more familiar with all of the tooling around all of that and they'll prefer it -- they will be aggravated by the limitations of having to only work on a remote db and not having debugging tools.\n\nSo this is just about matching up with the type of organisation you're in.\n\n>  I dont care about scaling because the scaling part is taken over by...\n\nNot relevant to a decision between dataframe libraries and SQL. Scaling is handled by the execution platform and is entirely independent of the data transformation and querying code you've written.\n\n>  I don't care about dependency hell because there are no version changes.\n\nThis also isn't really about dataframe libraries vs sql.\n\nSQL databases do go through version changes and they can change behaviour or syntax and that can break things. As an individual pipeline or procedure writer you might not see that much if you've been relying on a DBA or an ops team to handle all of that for you, or if databases aren't upgraded for years you just may have not have gone through such a process. I have been at an org that spent about a year and a few million dollars desperately trying to update their all their SQL to work on the new DW because it worked *slightly* differently and randomly broke all sorts of things.\n\nIf you get things working and just stick with a version, you're not going to get dependency hell regardless, because your dependencies aren't changing. Even if you are updating... I can't recall ever having any data issues due to version updates.\n\nAll software gets updated over time. All changes can potentially break things. You can have frequent changes and small easily fixed issues, or rare big changes that are horrendously painful. These are platform considerations, so they don't directly relate to whether you're using dataframes or sql.\n\n> It is quite general and I don't face problems with migrating to another rdms.\n\nFor the most basic of select statements, sure, you can usually copy+paste things over. For actual pipelines and management though, you're often going to have to change syntax around to fit with whatever server you're running on.\n\n* T-SQL uses `TOP` after `SELECT` but other dialects use `LIMIT` at the end\n* QUALIFY exists in some dialects but not others\n* Does your DDL have `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` or only `SELECT INTO`\n* What options do you have for tables in your DDL -- they are often quite different\n* Some RDBMS allow partition exchanges, but they don't all work the same way\n* Some servers allow `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS` while others require you check first.\n* Some servers allow `CREATE OR REPLACE` while others require you `DROP` then `CREATE`\n* Some dialects have ANTI and SEMI joins, others require you to implement in a subquery\n\nIf you completely swap your dataframe libraries around you'll have to go through a similar process of finding equivalents. Or you could just not - if your pipelines run on their own host then each pipeline can use a different library, allowing you to gradually migrate from one to another. It isn't like when you have a single SQL database you're running on, and when you want to switch you have to move *everything*.\n\n> In most cases it look's cleaner to me than f.e. snowpark\n\nYou're just used to it (though I can't speak to snowpark specifically). Personally *I* find that the composability of dataframes and transformer functions allows me to better encapsulate certain behaviours and abstract them away. It allows me to run partial transformations rather than having to faff around with reworking subqueries or CTEs, and I don't have to scroll up and down massively long queries even for what ends up being a large and complex transformation.\n\n> The development roundtrip is super fast.\n\nYou're probably just more used to it. What even is the 'roundtrip' to you? What are the development, test, and deployment cycles you're looking at using?\n\n> Problems like scd and cdc are already solved million times\n\nAnd they have the same approaches in dataframes. You're still doing the same operations, you're just expressing them differently.\n\n---\n\n> Unittests are easier\n\nThis is significantly underselling it. By integrating the dataframe library into your imperative language, like Python, you can generate synthetic data during the script. Your transformations can be expressed as functions, which means you don't even need to load data into any kind of locally-run database, you can just inject data directly into the transformation function to check for the result. You can do this interactively when developing, chaining your own custom data directly into the functions that you are testing. Everything you write here can then by turned into an automated test.\n\n---\n\nThe biggest aspect you are missing is that dataframes are integrated into another programming language, which allows your pipelines and processes to be much more dynamic and much more capable.\n\nFor example, I can write a function that takes a dataframe and a list of key columns and it will automatically generate a column expression to generate a hashdiff. I don't have to list out the data columns every single time, it can inspect the dataframe schema and figure that out without running any actual transformations.\n\nI could have a function that looks at a struct column and automatically comes up with the column expression that will flatten it out. It can automatically do this recursively as well, making it very easy to flatten out ingested json data.\n\nI can write a UDF that can make use of *anything* in my programming language and return the result data back to the execution engine.\n\nDuring a long line of transformation steps I can inspect the data as it goes to change behaviour, including conditionally sending messages or alerts out. I don't have to wait for the end of a procedure to collect a result, I don't need another system to query some logging table to poll for results.\n\nI can make use of the fact that the programming language will have an LSP in my IDE to allow me to jump between transformer functions. Every time I see some abstracted behaviour and want to know how it works, I press a single key and jump directly to that code. If I want to rename something in my logic it is a single keypress and typing the new name, and that variable reference is renamed everywhere without error.\n\nWhen building complex transformations I can handle what would otherwise be complex subqueries or CTEs by chaining a single function call. I don't have to re-nest the previous statement in their own `SELECT` statements, I just take the existing dataframe and chain another `.select()` off of it.\n\nOverall this gives you more flexibility and expressiveness, but requires a slightly more complex approach. That tradeoff isn't necessarily for everyone, but it doesn't make one option absolutely better or worse than the other, it just depends on what you *want*.\n\n---\n\nAs others have mentioned, they're not inherently exclusive. While using an RDBMS as your execution engine may prevent effective use of dataframes, using a dataframe-based execution engine you can also write SQL. Spark allows you to swap back and forth between SQL and dataframes (https://spark.apache.org/sql/) ; [Polars can also do it](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/dev/reference/expressions/api/polars.sql.html) ; and [Daft is bringing it in too](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/sql/overview/#example)",

That is not the case for a UUID/Blob data so they will always use the 16 bytes allocated to them when stored on disk even if they do in memory. \n\n\n https://sqlite.org/fileformat2.html#varint\n\n\nTL:DR numbers are smaller than UUIDs on disk when you change to UUID small numbers take up more space. \n\n\n> Any tips on reducing that overhead while still using UUIDs?\n\n\nFirst suggestion. Don't worry about it for 600MB unless this genuinely matters. *IF* It genuinely is worth the effort. Try splitting the UUID into two 16 bit numbers and decode the UUID into two 16 bit numbers and re-render as a UUID on the way back out. ",

Under the covers the micro-partitions in Snowflake are immutable, changes to them cause a rewrite. I've managed to get great performance improvements in snowflake by:\n\n1. Selectively updating columns rather than all, if you take an SCD2 approach you can only update a valid\\_to column which can help. This is particularly great at reducing table scan time in incremental loads in DBT.\n2. Really spend time trying to figure out good cluster keys. Sometimes you can use natural keys in the data, sometimes you need to create them. For example, I am able to use a cluster key to refer to a general site and I am able to use another key to relate to a specific day, from a standard timestamp. This way I limit rewrites to a single site for a single day. When dealing with updating data, you are usually going to be dealing with the most recent day / previous several days.\n3. Design your tables so that most of your work is append only. Snowflake is most performant when you just throw more data at it, you bypass the merge issue entirely if you are able to just throw data into a table and then selectively filter.\n\nQuery optimisation is a pain but snowflake has good tools available, the profiler is fantastic.",

Sit down with your boss and explain that this is not right, and that you won't be working any more overtime.  If they are stupid and try to force you then superficially accept, but immediately start looking for a new company with a better culture.\n\nIf you really want a job with low / no code I would suggest roles like:  Solution Architect, Dev Ops, or Practise / Product Manager roles.  Those roles will allow you to use the problem solving skills you've build as a software engineer, but generally have less coding day to day, as the focus more on big picture architecture and integrating systems.\n\nThat being said this sounds way more like a problem with you being overworked than it is one of you hating coding.

The small number of engineers could not keep up with the volume and variety of requests so the analytics team bought a BI solution that allowed them to maintain their own models (Looker in this case). Based on your definition this was a ‘Shift Right’. \n\nThe analytics team operated for years without dedicated people to ensure their environment was well organized or resilient to new business processes that require the logic that was locked in that transformation layer.\n\nWhen I took over that position we started to migrate logic out of Looker and into DBT, a process we are still working through today. \n\nThe pilot project here was to deal with a deviation of a legacy data model in our data engineering environment by cleaning up and replacing it with all the goodies our analytics team extended and prepared in Looker for years. Once the legacy model was replaced we also made sure everything was set to refer to the new models.\n\nWe are not moving away from having analysts model in Looker/LookML, though we have also set them up with DBT Cloud. Instead we are treating that workflow more like prototyping. Once our analysts have iteratively refined those models and they are stable we find the best way to ‘Shift them to the Left’. Sometimes these prototypes are abandoned by the business or analysts. This is fine, we didn’t put any additional engineering resources into it.",

ETL is actually a very good fit to implement \"Shift Left\" because you can potentially develop your data product (from the Shift Left parlance) using Low-Code/No-Code tooling. That is extremely valuable. Now when you consider the fact there is now a trend of decentralization and building the so -called \"data mesh\" architecture, you can easily see how the \"Shift Left\" is the exact paradigm to implement the \"data mesh\". These two concepts are made for each other.\n\nIn my opinion the above architecture is superior to what is currently being pushed as \"modern\".

An example find yourself a good EL tool then see if theres Dagster integrations not limiting to yourself only to tools with Dagster integrations and missing out on good tools because they dont.

Initially, I handled most of the metric logic in Python, but pulling raw rows into Python and transforming them there became a bottleneck — especially for simple aggregations that SQL can handle faster and closer to the data. The move toward SQL wasn’t about avoiding all reuse or flexibility in Python, but about shifting the **calculation into the layer best suited for it**.\n\nYou mentioned your company started using ClickHouse — does that mean you still have the backend doing the logic, but the performance gains come from faster DB → Python access? I’d be curious if you think a solution like that might have been a better fit (or more industry-standard) for what I’m trying to do.\n\nAs for your config question — yes! It’s actually config-driven now. We’ve defined metric classes that are initialised with SQL logic and metadata, and the DAG handles the dependencies automatically, fitting each metric into the correct SQL wave. So adding a new metric is usually just a matter of defining it with a formula and group-by level — and the system figures out where it belongs in the calculation graph.\n\nThanks again — I really appreciate the thoughtful response.",

The downside, hard to maintain for self hosting, and depend on how you design the framework for development, it can be really complex to test, develop, and deploy, or it can be one merge request away to run the pipeline to production.\n\nFor Dagster, I really love the asset based orchestration that abstracting away the chaos of airflow dag dependencies. It is easier to develop and test in Dagster (I build a data platform for a SME by myself using dagster + dlt + dbt), and although it is harder to develop Dagster job/automation at first (and understand asset, definitions, sensors, job, op), it would be easier to scale after that. Also although this is not best practices, I can easily deploy Dagster on a single machine. The downside, the learning resources is fairly limited, and you can only rely on their slack channel for troubleshooting. Some features like out of the box alerting and RBAC is locked behind dagster plus CMIIW. Also, although easier to scale in terms of its python code, I still looking on how to scale it like peak airflow did with yaml based DAG factory.\n\nPersonally, I am a big fan of Dagster but I think Airflow will still be the norm especially for larger company for a foreseeable future, unless Dagster can make a great leap forward by utilized in a bigger company worldwide. Not a bad thing though, as Airflow also keep improving its feature like the task api and data aware scheduling. Still excited to see how airflow 3 can keep up with its competitors.",

Storage systems will generally give you metadata for when it was actually written, if you really need it, and often you don't necessarily care about when initial ingestion was physically written anyway, you care more about when you integrated it to some other more managed table.\n\nIt is important to get the 'business date/time' for the data, and be able to find it easily, because that's the traceable value that helps you understand the context of the data, it helps you deal with possible issues like late or out-of-order loads, and is the value you can tie back to upstream orchestration systems. It is usually a lot easier to ask for the data for a particular day's run, rather than try figure out when exactly it was actually written.\n\nThink of a scenario where some upstream system keeps CDC logs and dumps nightly copies to you during quiet downtime, and for some reason they aren't able to for a couple of days. Eventually they catch back up, and grab all the data that has accumulated over that time. By having the folders be the 'business time' they can go back and write the data segmented by the days that the data was *generated* rather than just when they transferred it to you. When the data was generated is usually more meaningful. This sort of thing can happen with DWs as well if they provide snapshots, but for some reason couldn't get them to you for a while.\n\n---\n\nWherever your data is landing, that's generally not where you're going to want to query it from. The initial landing areas are just to make ingestion easy, simple, and reliable. The upstream systems just need to get the data to you, then they can be cut out of the process. You can do anything you need to do after that, including integrating the data into a more usefully queryable structure.\n\nThe most useful categories I've found for these landing folders are...\n\n    context/\n     source_org/\n      source_system/\n       source_dataset/\n        schema_version/\n         year/\n          month/\n           day/\n            {everything_prior}-hourminutesecond-partition.extension\n\n... you can squish year+month together if it makes more sense, or add prefixes for the time if you have lots of small files, or add some extra layers if for example a source system has multiple databases/schemas. The partition is only needed if the source data is explicitly partitioned, like with kafka streams or azure event hubs. I'd put all the same details into filename as well, just in case you find the filename without the rest of the prefix for context, so you can identify the file anyway. The schema_version is there because these things always change schema eventually, and you might need slightly different code to handle different schemas, so you build it into the path so you can identify which ingestion code to run.",

It was simplier because no matter the type of data they had it would work the same way. So no modification per data type, just a single ingestion process that could be reusable across different data sources and APIs. It didn’t really matter because every new file created an s3 event and was processed and loaded into Snowflake. We requested that each payload add a timestamp metadata that represent when the data was capture from the API. This make it simplier to dedup same version of records in Snowflake. This also allowed everyone to backfill or reprocess old records without having to tell the data team. When new data come into Snowflake, we look at the max(timestamp) of the record we have in our snowflake table and we load every newest records. The downstream of there a newest file for an aggregate (like a day) we refresh that hole day.\n\nNow :\n\nWhat I’m trying to see if it’s that same timestamp base structure will cause some trouble in the future. Our Data Lake is more like a data dump as files are just there order by insert timestamp and not actual data. So we might have 30 different version of the same file, which should be dedup. And the only way to dedup it properly is to search for the entire history of files.\n\nFrom what I can think of the raw version that teams generate and the “raw” version on the data side will not be identical. Like I’ll create a process that takes the raw files, and restructure it so the files grouped by business date time.\n\n\nSo multiple question, do you usually have 2 raw structure or you generally put more and logic in the ingestion module so it understand the data and group things by business concepts ?\n\nAnother question would be in the case where I want to build a proper data lake using something like Iceberg and maybe spark, how would I be alerted of files changes or how could I simply load new files in order to clean them in my pipeline if they are not ordered by insert timestamp ? I think this is the part I’m not understanding the most with Data Lakes table format. Like yeah s3 events could technically give me the info, but I don’t want to update my tables each time there’s a new file, maybe I want to update things every hour or every day and wait for the file to accumulate. Without a structure by insert timestamp how would I be able to retrieve all news files simply ?\n\nThank you again.",

        "body": "> do you usually have 2 raw structure or ...\n\nI do find the term 'raw' to be a bit overloaded, as it can mean different things to different people. If you're talking about data at a more base level, then 'raw' means exactly as the source provided it in a bit-for-bit binary fashion. If you're talking at more of a logical or modelling level then 'raw' just means the original data before business rules are applied. You can have, and with data lakes will get usefulness from, having both of those 'raw' layers.\n\nI tend to split up the layers a bit differently. I would talk about landing → structured → standardised → (modelled) → customised → export.\n\nLanding is a pure as-is area, exact file format and everything as it was provided. There can be all sorts of duplicates in there, but upstream should be applying business/snapshots dates so you can properly know what's what. You can have multiple schemas for the same data, even overlapping data drops for different schemas during a migration. That's why the folder hierarchy is important so that it doesn't just turn into a swamp. This is a flexible 'write once' area so that you can rerun and rebuild off it as needed, or accumulate data while you work on how to integrate it.\n\nThe 'structured' layer is where you put that into a standard \"\"\"raw\"\"\" structure from a modelling perspective - you turn it into tables or bring it into your DW. You can do this as an 'append only' so it is easy to bring the data in and you don't have to worry about any integration logic. All you're doing here is making it easy to query. Once it is easy to query, it will be much easier to make sure your dedupe process afterwards is working as you expect.\n\nThen you can go about standardising it - flatten out nested structures, remove duplicate data, apply historical SCD2 tracking, etc.\n\nIf you're doing broad modelling to being multiple related systems together into one data model, it will likely be easiest to do that over the standardised data.\n\nFrom either of those you make the custom datasets for consumers, and the export datasets if you're transferring data on to another system.\n\n---\n\n> how would I be alerted of files changes or how could I simply load new files in order to clean them in my pipeline if they are not ordered by insert timestamp\n\nIf you don't want to run on *every* new file as it occurs, you just need something that will accumulate a list of 'changed files since X'. A lambda triggered by the S3 write and a little DynamoDB could do it -- write to a partition key by the dataset and a sort key by the 'actual write time' with some extra data around the file path and so on, and some code flag for the processing date. Then if you only want to run ingestions hourly, or daily, start up the process and have it pull the data from dynamo.\n\nIf you're worried about properly tracking the state while having long-running processes, or the long term retention of this metadata, pull the new data out of dynamo and then immediately update some iceberg table for state tracking of your processes. You'll be able to keep a full audit log of every file that has been ingested, whether one is currently being worked on, etc.\n\nThere's a bunch of alternatives that do a similar thing. S3 trigger into lambda that writes to SQS. Have a python lambda run on your hourly/daily that drains the SQS and writes to a duckdb or your iceberg. Or you could send it via kinesis data streams. Or you could send it to kinesis firehose, and it can automatically buffer the writes for 15 minutes and write to a parquet file for you and you just run your daily process querying that data.\n\nThe main gist of it is that you're buffering event data into some lightweight temporary store, then moving it in bulk to lake storage.",

About 30% of the way through the process we got onto datafold and started data diffing the datasets in both places and found a tonnnnnn of random stuff we missed in migration because sql server and snowflake just work differently, like with case sensitivity and extra spaces and date function quirky-ness. We even found issues with our previous load process in sql server that we had no idea about XD.\n\n  \nThe team is responsive and during the migration we reached out for them to fix or add a bunch of features and they consistently turned them around to keep us moving. \n\nDefinitely recommend when migrating out of sql server.

Communicate with relevant stakeholders - First talk to your boss and explain the situation to see what he thinks. He may be able to direct you to people with more knowledge regarding the entire situation. You say you have databases, so someone is probably managing them and they would be a good place to start the conversation in terms of determining the low hanging fruit. It helps when all the data people are working with each other. Find out who is relevant and talk to them so you can potentially collaborate.\n\n2. Prioritize what is most important - Look at all those tasks you have in your backlog, rank them by how much value they would add, while keeping effort in mind. Create a 3 by 3 grid with priority/frequency on one axis (low, medium, high) and effort on another axis (low, medium, high). Your domain knowledge should allow you to quickly assess this. I would have a meeting with your boss and the other relevant people from bullet point 1. if possible. Ideally target the high priority ones first with focus on those perceivied to be the least effort.\n\nAfter this, the steps that are taken depend on what is important to tackle first: data integrity (deal with inconsistencies), data consolidation (centralize where data is located), data automation (automate a way to ingest files), data standardization (ensure data is in a constant format), etc. Just make sure you document anything and everything, it will eventually be a life saver down the line.\n\nI think you can start with learning high level concepts related to data governance as it will provide a solid foundation as to how to approach everything else.\n\nHope this helps, let me know if you got any questions.",

By making it their problem, you incentivise good behaviour- specially where you can present ‘bad records’ to leadership. \n\nYou can even gamify it a bit- show a trend line with time on one axis, and number of bad records as another.

Mistakes are expected.  \n\nThe order management team wanted to fix things, but we didn't give them enough time. DQ errors were only caught when our pipeline ran in the middle of the night. To fix that, we created a view that encapsulated the logic of the table where most DQ issues can be caught. Then, the table just did a select * on the view. \n\nWe moved our DQ tests to the view and ran them each hour. Slack alerts notify the team if something is wrong and they fix it before our pipeline runs. It was a simple solution to a big problem. Most of the work was getting the right teams on board with the solution.",

What’s worked for my projects in the past:\n\n* Schema enforcement everywhere - Avro, JSON, Pydantic, whatever fits your stack. Fail fast if something’s off. Don’t try to fix it later, just reject bad input.\n* No raw access - Don’t let people dump whatever they want into S3 or a DB. Build upload APIs or controlled ingestion tools with validation and clear error feedback (like \"invoice\\_date must be ISO-8601, not 'soon'\").\n* Alerting + dashboards - If bad data shows up, make it visible. Send Slack alerts, track source systems with the most rejections, build a \"wall of shame\". \n* Data contracts - This is getting more popular. You define what good data should look like (like no nulls in key columns, specific enums only ...), and you break the pipeline or alert when things go off the rails.\n\nHonestly though, I think a big part of the problem is social. You have to make the business care about why it matters - bad data = bad reporting = bad decisions. Similar to what u/Vhiet suggested. Once they see that, they’re usually more willing to work with you.\n\nIt’s not perfect, but this mix of tech + visibility + a little shame goes a long way.",

You should make sure to learn the various programming paradigms. Object oriented, functional, etc. Another thing, don't think you need to know everything right away. Getting code to work is an awesome first step and definitely doesn't doom you to an eternity of writing spaghetti code. Software Engineering takes decades to master and you will always be learning.\n\n1. DRY (Don't repeat yourself). If you have to repeat the same code twice, it should be abstracted out into a reusable class or function\n\n2. KISS (Keep it simple stupid). Nobody wants to read and maintain a big-ass function. Write your code so that someone in the future (probably future you) can easily understand it. When you think this way you start breaking out each piece of functionality into a simple unit that does one thing. Otherwise known as SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).\n\n3. YAGNI (You ain't gonna need it). Don't implement functionality that isn't immediately needed. You can waste your entire life accounting for all future possibilities that most of the time don't come to pass. Write code such that you CAN add those things later if necessary without a major rewrite.",

        "body": "im gonna tell a little story. it isn't a story about yandev code, but it's a story about very similar code.\n\ni make code and asset contributions to a few open source game projects around github. one of these projects is a medieval fantasy game based around old ad&d stuff, both in terms of vibes and in terms of raw mechanics. one of these mechanics is the ability to dodge. it's a very simple one; when you get hit, it makes a quick calculation, and if you win then you negate the damage, spend a little stamina, and move to an adjacent tile, which is all pretty simple. complicating matters ever so slightly is that some classes are expert dodgers and get a better calculation on their dodge roll, but in return they have to be wearing light armor or no armor to do it; heavy or medium armor means they dodge like everyone else, which is poorly.\n\nso, a question for the reader: how would you go about determining if the player that got hit has the expert dodge feat and is wearing light armor, allowing them to dodge expertly?\n\na novice solution would be to simply check on hit that the feat and proper armor class are present. after all, you already check on hit to do things like damage and dodge calculations in the first place, so adding a little check right in there isn't a ton of overhead at all. in fact, i think this solution probably works fine for most projects and something similar to it is probably lurking in a lot of video games, even high quality ones.\n\na more advanced solution might be something like checking only when the player equips armor, since we can assume armor doesn't magically change weight classes, and because players will be equipping items far less frequently than they're attacking things, as a general rule. if the player has the feat and equips light armor, it can broadcast an event than then means the player is going to dodge well until their equipment changes again, when we can check once more for what they did. this is probably a little more performant because you're doing the check far less frequently, and during a less critical gameplay moment than when a weapon hits someone, when you can be a little freer with resources. this solution would be a good methodology if you need to wring performance out of the system, though like i said in the last paragraph, the novice solution is probably good enough for most projects.\n\nnow let's go back to our example game and see how they did it. They chose to have the entity itself check if it was wearing the right kind of armor. In fact, they had every character entity check. A player character with the dodge feat and light armor checks. A player character without the dodge feat still checks anyway. A goblin that cannot have the feat checks. A chicken, which doesn't even really do combat, and doesn't have inventory slots? You better believe that chicken is checking to see what its armor class is.\n\nyou might be holding your hands on your head and going, \"wow! that's pretty bad!\" But remember up above, how the better solution doesn't just ask how to check, but when to check? this game had every single mob check their armor's weight class-even if they don't wear armor-*every single fucking tick.* Hypothetically this means ten times a second every single player and non player character in the game stops to ask, \"am i wearing light armor?\" except for the part that the ticks weren't actually deciseconds in this game because of sloppy code like this.\n\nso, finally coming around to OP's question:  \n\\- you probably aren't writing yandev tier code if you have the self awareness to worry about writing yandev tier code.  \n\\- you definitely aren't writing yandev tier code if you have even a vague idea of a computer as having a limited amount of math-per-second to crunch your code with, even if you don't understand anything else about computers as objects.  \n\\- read your documentation so you don't accidentally cook up a proc that fires every fucking tick, though.",

For instance, a lot of bootcamp grads don't really understand how to get their code running on ANY web platform -- because they have no idea about filesystems, networking, dns, hosting.... none of it.  Then when you scale that up to the enterprise they have absolutely no idea about load balancers, replication, traffic shaping, etc.   While college grads aren't going to have hands on experience with these things, I've found that they generally have some foundational knowledge to \"how the internet works\" that I can anchor to. \n\nAnd unfortunately, this doesn't just apply to networking, but it's EVERYTHING.   Differences in file paths, text encoding, and general code portability that you see commonly aren't really taught in the \"build this project\" monorail of tutorials / bootcamps.  \n\n\n\nThe other thing that I see pretty commonly is a complete whiff on generics / abstractions / object polymorphism, for whatever reason a lot of folks don't understand that Type: Shape can contain be the parent to Triangle and Triangle extends shape....

These parts are covered everywhere on the web and if you really want to, nothing stops you from acquiring that  knowledge at your own pace with lots of practical application.\n\nThe programming lectures during my university were a total waste, as were the ones on software patterns. Data structures and algorithms was at least okay. And really, O(n) notation isn't really that hard, complexity theory only gets nasty outside of the stuff you need for a day job. \n\nOn the other hand the big advantage of university lectures is the mathematicians mind-set of taking the entirety of a problem, reducing to its most fundamental equivalent form and then selecting from all possible solutions the ones with the desired properties. This is something that very few self-taught people can do, and real life project work also favours incrementally approaching a best-effort. But every once in a while you need to have a problem solved for every possible input, and then this is extremely valuable.\n\nAlso a big plus is a structured introduction to concepts that aren't easily explained or need prerequisite knowledge or even specialised hardware. Stuff like:\n\n- Hamming codes only really make sense if you think of them as maximally distant points in high dimensions\n- Wavelet compression needs Hilbert spaces as prerequisite\n- Cryptography is tons of esoteric mathematics\n- chip design, robotics, classical machine learning, applied computer graphics like MRI are all not really doable on a standard notebook\n- databases are about a lot more than SQL or normalised tables.

        "body": "Sorry to hear you're going thru this.  No, not all internships are like this.  The \"this is an easy task\" and other passive aggressive responses in particular are major indicators of a fairly toxic culture in that team and very likely the company.  That's not typical of most teams, but it's also not as rare as one might wish.  (And it is more common in teams that are hiring, because those teams have a higher turnover.)\n\nToxicity aside, the overall lack of guidance sounds like what happens when the hiring team is more swamped than they expected when they signed up to have interns.  The pattern of having to drop lower priority balls in a crunch is pretty normal, and it's likely \"intern support\" is one of those lower priority balls.\n\nIn that situation, an attitude of \"interns are both cheap and temporary, let's give them a non-essential nice-to-have and if they get it working, great, if not we'll sort it out later\" is the kind of strategy some people will run with if they have some interns they don't know what to do with.  Another possibility is they're attempting a sort of extended interview, where what they wanted wasn't so much to train people as to identify people with the tenacity to get it figured out, with an intent to make a job offer to those already at the \"swim\" level of capabilities (in a complete failure to understand (or probably even comprehend the possibility) that this is a side gig for you while you're mainly trying to graduate, rather than your sole full-time work focus like their jobs are).\n\nEither way, your best outcome here is to get it running more or less ok, get a good letter of recommendation, and find a different place for your next paid position.  (Tenacity, managing burnout, and finding alternative second-best outcomes under limited support and uncertainty of project success are all important skills in this field, but ideally you'd be sort of eased into them with some decent mentoring along the way, rather than left alone to maybe figure out your burnout damage or not. Also, burnout is a pretty well-studied phenomenon, and it will serve you well into the future if you read up on the literature, as another side project for an hour or 2/week.)\n\nFor getting your actual task figured out, there's a few decent options under the guidance they've (implicitly) given that they don't want their engineers to be bothered.  You're doing the right thing by posting in external forums, this approach can help with your technical questions too.  (Plus of course the web searching you're presumably doing about the error messages and unexpected behaviors you're seeing.)\n\nYou can also try finding a person or 2 in the company (edit: or outside the company) (but not your official team and not the point of contact telling you it should be easy) who you like their vibe, and just ask if they'd be available for an hour each week or so, and if they can, see if you can collect good questions they can help you get thru efficiently, or point you in their idea of the next step, for stuff you don't know what to do with.\n\nAlso a useful trick is to keep a slide deck open and capture screenshots of useful things to ask about.  Later you can trim it into a presentation or a walkthrough of issues you still have that you can show people easily.\n\nAnyway, good luck and remember that your most important goal in this arrangement is to impress someone enough they want to work with you and will write you a letter and/or be a good future contact in another job. Getting your \"easy\" project running is a decent means to that end, but you can also potentially achieve it by showing people the hurdles you did overcome on the way to not finishing.\n\n(Btw, most sane people doing actual backend work know that nothing in this space is as easy as it sounds, so the people telling you this are probably either lying to put pressure on you or not all that experienced themselves and mistaken about the difficulty of something they haven't attempted. Possibly they just forgot how they learned the things they know now and how hard it was, but probably they don't know how to do it either, and would take at least twice as long as their estimate.)",

There was no training, minor handholding and they had the same mindset of \"learn by doing\" where they treated me like a junior than an intern.\n\nThe difference was that I was with very supportive people. There was a mentoring program as well where I had 1-1s fortnightly.\n\nMy advice is to just grind it out. The experiences you will gain are really worth it, not just from a technical standpoint but from a behavioural standpoint as well (like how to be independent, proactive, effective use of time and how to talk to the right people for questions). \n\nAt the start, I felt overwhelmed, I hated how there was no training or time given to learn some tech (had to learn while working with them). But looking back, I appreciate the experiences because I learned so much and accomplished a lot. It's experience that future employees will appreciate.\n\nSo just stick with it.",

        "body": "I was in your position before. Just my two cents:\n\nWhat is not ok \n\n* No onboarding structure: Being dropped into a codebase on day 4 with minimal context isn’t setting you up for success—it’s just irresponsible.\n* No dedicated mentor: Saying “this should be easy” to a new hire without offering guidance is lazy management. Interns and entry-level engineers usually need a few weeks to a few months to become productive contributors (reference: The Manager’s Path by Camille Fournier).\n* Poor leadership: The people supervising you either don’t know how to mentor—or they just don’t care to. That reflects poorly on them, not on you.\n   * If I were mentoring a second-year college student, I’d fully expect them to get stuck and need hands-on guidance at first. That’s normal. Once they’ve merged a few pull requests and built some confidence, then I’d start stepping back and letting them operate more independently. That’s how real growth happens.\n\nWhat you can do \n\n* Document everything: Keep track of what you tried, what went wrong, error logs, who you asked for help, what they said, etc. It shows initiative and covers you if anyone questions your effort. Learn as much as you can but do not stress over it after working hours.\n* Ask for clarification in writing Something like: *“Just to confirm, we’re expected to deploy a live service to EC2 using Docker and environment variables—is that correct?”* This can prompt a reality check or at least put expectations on the record. \n\nThis sounds like bad internship experience, and that’s OK. Internships are a two-way street: *they* are evaluating you, but *you* are also learning about them. If this is how this team treats interns, I wouldn’t want to work there full time. Don’t let their disorganization hurt your confidence. And like others said—prioritize school. That’ll outlast this internship.\n\nMany people have gone through rough starts and still gone on to build great careers. Doing your best in a poorly managed environment speaks volumes about your resilience. Try to take what you can from the experience, learn from it, and keep moving forward. One difficult internship or job won’t define your future—it’s just one chapter, not the whole story.",

To develop a work ethic you need to commit to doing the thing you want regardless of whatever happens in your day. Sun, rain, unexpected events etc. See it as a non-negotiable to do practice for self-improvement just like how you’d see working out. Commit to it for three months, then reevaluate taking some days off. \n\n3) Sometimes you can’t balance everything. You’ll need to either sacrifice stuff like sleep, social life etc if you wanna do everything well. My suggestion is have an overview plan of your school work. Then every week/day prioritise 2 ~ 3 main tasks could be school work/leetcode etc. Also try win the morning and don’t waste time scrolling in bed (don’t do it at night either). \n\nGood luck my friend",

But for video streaming, latency only matters at the very beginning of playback. What matters for video streaming is consistent *bandwidth*, and this typically isn't a bottleneck because ISPs on different continents are connected by multiple high-bandwidth backbone connections.\n\nYou will only notice \"buffering problems\" if the video data on the client side **runs out**, and that only happens if the bandwidth of the network connection is not sufficient to keep putting data into the buffer as fast as it's being played.\n\nAs an example, I'm in the USA, and I just did a bandwidth test using a server in Perth, Australia, which is about as close as you can get to the opposite side of the world from me. I got a bandwidth of 60Mbps, which is way more than enough for an HD video stream, and a latency of about 230ms. That latency is not ideal -- it'll add a perceptible delay of a fraction of a second when first loading a page, or when seeking to a different point in the video -- but it doesn't affect smoothness of playback.",

The piracy websites do not host the content, they are link databases, they have a bunch of links to copies of the content that are uploaded to other providers.\n\nThe websites that actually deliver the content are generic upload sites like youtube, except they are not as proactive at enforcing takedowns, and there are hundreds of generic versions of these upload sites. The upload sites attempt to comply with all regulations and DMCA requests, but there are two reasons why that they are always behind. For one thing a website like youtube has algorithms that proactively detect infringing content, which these generic sites lack, for another there are dozens or hundreds of these generic upload sites and each of them will get many different copies, or similar copies of the same media. Finally they make their money in many cases primarily or exclusively by hosting specifically for this gray area market.\n\nYou really need to look into the details of the DMCA to understand how and why the sites are designed like they are. The EU has its own regulations other than the DMCA, which I am less familiar with, but it's the same idea. It's a shell game of who is responsible at the end of the day, which involves taking advantage of legitimate privacy protections.\n\nGiven I am not a huge fan of copyright law in the first place(a royalty system is better IMO, rather than exclusive distribution rights, especially with the lack of physical media), I don't have a huge problem with this whole system, but it ends up being wasteful and leading to creators getting zero revenue, instead of a healthy revenue share that would happen in a royalty system, without exclusive distribution rights.\n\nIf we had a royalty system similar to radio, then the website that offers the best service for the lowest cost would win, and content creators would earn a consistent amount on their media that platforms could not control. But as it is, platforms love the power that comes with exclusive distribution rights, so they lobby hard to maintain an antiquated and inefficient \"Intellectual Property\", ie publishing system, that literally goes back to the politics of british monarchy in 1710, a half a century before they even abolished the slave trade:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute\\_of\\_Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Anne)\n\nIn programming a lot of the \"architecture\" ends up being designed around these legal issues.\n\nEdit: you are also probably right that these sites do not use AWS, at least not exclusively, but there are other services that they can use, which may not be as proactive in their enforcement.",

The machines that constitute that load would exist in clouds with the least security or monitoring.  You'd want a few mirrors so when one inevitably gets whacked you could keep on chugging.  With some VPN work you could potentially hide such servers in larger cloud services.\n\nNote, torrents exist in a gray area.

For example, I’ve read through tons of very **heavily** utilized and popular  JavaScript libraries out there and nearly vomited at how absolutely awful the code is written despite the fact that, sure, it works and gets the job done. \n\n3. My recommendation is to read through the “Clean Code” principles. HOWEVER - and this applies very generally to all things in software and in life more broadly - don’t make it some rigid religious dogma; moderation is the key to most things. There are purists who take the Clean Code initiative to the extreme and it’s gross, please don’t do that.\n\n4. Time-box your exploration. You want to dive in and learn and understand things which is great, but if it’s a complete rabbit hole that reduces your actual productivity then you’re doing yourself a disservice. Instead, aim to apply what you’re learning into your project and you can always commit and then iteratively refactor your own code to improve it. Try to set goals on what things you hope to achieve or learn each time you do your deep dives. Also, maybe you’re doing this already, use a debugger and step through the code as you call into library functions/methods as it will expose you to the inner workings but in perhaps a more directed and isolated path (with a beginning and end).",

        "body": ">The specific example was including \\`using namespace std\\` which I know full well has issues, but it made me question what \"industry standards\" even entail.\n\nThe real issue is using that directive in a header file, because then you force any client who wants to \"include\" your header file, to also be \"using namespace std\", which she may not want to do.\n\nAs for \"industry standards\", though, the only \"real\" industry standard is \"to follow the rules of the team leader\", as it were. In a University course, your prof. is the \"team leader\" position so if he/she says \"thou shalt not use 'using namespace std'\" then that is The Rule and you must follow it.\n\nFor my own C++ code I like to use 'using namespace std' because personally it makes my code easier to read for \"me\". But I can see the arguments against it for \"production code\" (e.g. what if the future C++35 adds a new word to the std:: namespace, a word which you're already using in your local code). A better in-between solution is to use \"individual using\" directives like \"using std::cout\", \"using std::cin\", etc. However, that's a bunch of stuff to type out -- so to use it in practice you should either put them all in a header file, or use some smart IDE that inserts them all for you at the top (some IDEs can automatically insert all of them for you as needed).\n\nMost C++ programmers I have seen online just tend to avoid using directives and just write a bunch of std::cout, std::cin blah blah everywhere, which personally I think contributes to the impression that C++ is very difficult to read. It's a subtle style issue balanced on an issue of future-proofing the code. Sometimes we cannot have it both ways, unfortunately. Try to find a style which is readable for you, but also respect the local standards if they are in place. That's the best we can do for this.\n\nA commonly cited example is that \"using namespace std\" imports names which you may want to use for your own variables, like \"max\". OK, you got me there. However, how you resolve this is up to you. You can name your local variable something else, for example, \"max\\_value\", or you can even resolve it by adding a trailing underscore, like \"max\\_\", since the likelihood of a name ending in an \\_ being declared in a Standard or in an external library is extremely slim. Personally I got used to that style from programming in Python. I know it looks kind of ugly at first, but it seems like Python has a lot of reserved words that I often want to use as local variable names, so I ended up seeing a programmer using that convention when porting code from C++ to Python (to append \\_ to a name which we would 'obviously' use in the C++ code but which was  'conflicting' in the Python code), and it stuck for me.\n\nHowever, I would hesitate to use this style in \"production team code\" unless I saw explicitly that it were already being employed there. Stick to the local conventions, is rule 1.\n\nSame goes for prefixing \"m\\_\" to member names in C++ class designs. Personally I think that's weird in C++, but \\*a bunch\\* of programmers do it for various reasons. So, if that convention is being used currently in the code you're working on, then by all means, continue to do so in that codebase when you add code to that class, for the sanity of your co-workers. It's kind of a weird style rule which seems to only apply for the unique situation to make naming the parameters of a constructor initiazer list less confusing. OTOH, once the convention is in place, something in your brain associates seeing the the \"m\\_\" before a name as a hint that it's a member name, and vice versa (that an absence of the m\\_ means it's \\*not\\*). So this makes it kind of hard to \"quit\" using this convention once you start using it.\n\nThe other benefit of m\\_ is that it makes \"naive autocomplete\" more convenient. By \"naive autocomplete\" I mean autocomplete which is not actually understanding your code, and which is just memorizing the symbols that you typed previously in the document or in other documents. So that's another convenience of that. Personally nowadays though I always try to use \"C++-aware\" environments for this language. Their availability nowadays is widespread enough.",

I know there are big camps on this, but that one is where I sit.  Good editors mark the matched brace when you mouse over or click it, so its not the problem it used to be. \n\nmemory management is something you avoid unless you can't for some reason.  Most of the time, you don't need to do anything special other than make sure you don't take big performance losses from doing it wrong like trigger a page fault every iteration of a loop (this sort of thing is almost always a localized code problem, not a program wide management problem).   If you know how this stuff works, you just naturally avoid the problems after a while. \n\nindustry does not code to the bleeding edge if the people involved are wise.  You pick something and stick with it, for example one of the last projects I worked on used c++ 17 because 20 wasn't out yet when the project started.  (You can flag the compiler to use the version you want in c++).  A few years back we were using kafka for database work and the manager insisted we upgrade every time a new version came out and yea, we rewrote the code repeatedly for a while.

This is how you learn programming by working on projects that interests you. If you like web development, then study JavaScript and make your first website (idk much bout web dev not my expertise). Don't be dependent on courses, learn only that what interests you and try to work on projects to improve your skills. Maybe you can share what made you be interested in programming and what your future career plan is?",

        "body": "IMO what separates a junior engineer from a senior engineer is the difference between solving a problem and architecting a solution.  A lot of that just comes down to time and experience as others have already pointed out.  I do think there are some things you can do to fast track your way to a more senior level though. \n\n* Pair program with other more senior engineers, especially early in a project so you can understand how they balance architecting a robust solution vs solving the immediate problem.  If you can coax one into being your mentor, even better.  Most employers encourage this sort of interaction to foster growth in their engineering departments, it's just a lot of devs can be solitary creatures and choose not to exercise this muscle.\n* Review PR's from other more senior engineers.  Sounds like you're already doing this to an extent, but don't be afraid to leave non-blocking comments on the PR and ask questions about how or why they did something.  If anything this will make them feel good for being so smart and getting to explain the cool thing they did to someone else.  A lot of people are afraid to ask questions because they think it will make them look dumb, but the opposite is almost always true with software development - in fact you will find senior engineers are often the most inquisitive.\n* Check your assumptions always.  Senior engineers ask lots of questions because they assume nothing.  Senior engineers don't learn to do something one way then always do things that way just because that's the way they already know.  They try to consider every angle in every circumstance before those circumstances are encountered, which may mean exploring a different solution instead.\n* RTFM more.  Go through all the docs for everything in your organization's tech stack and familiarize yourself with the basics, focusing on a breadth of understanding rather than a depth of knowledge.  You want to know what possibilities and capabilities exist in your environment, so you can consider all those options in your project planning.  You can then return to the docs for a deep dive into the specific features that prove relevant to your current project.\n\nHope this helps.  At the end of the day the answer is still \"put in the time\", but I think these are some ways you can put in that time more efficiently.",

        "body": "At their best, a framework is a set of code extending a programming language, a set of guidelines, tools, and a general design philosophy geared towards supporting one specific thing particularly well (even if it may be a relatively broad thing), in terms of making it easier to do complex things, making doing such things safer/less error-prone, or simply taking some guesswork and boilerplate out of the equation to focus on what the framework considers the important matters.\n\nAt their worst, they provide pre-made legacy code (in the form of 'legacy code is any architectural decision of one's code that was made by someone else before one's own input', which is a rather broad definition) that constrains things in unexpected and unwanted ways while not making clear what assumptions the design as a whole is making, all while requiring a fair amount of additional learning to use.\n\nYou can absolutely do everything without them, but that's not necessarily advisable in the same way that you could, technically, do all your programming in assembly or C (well, traditionally/outside of front-end, which is where frameworks are most common) - which is sometimes also the right choice. If you know well what you're doing without one, you may be better off continuing as you are. Keep in mind that a lot of larger stuff is done as a team, and frameworks (I think) tend facilitate that sort of work.\n\nA framework may be worth learning if it seems to support the sort of result you're after, if it's an industry standard in an industry you're looking to enter/work in, or even just if you're interested in exposure to more/varying design principles and ideas regarding certain topics.\n\nEdit: It can also be useful to *not* use a framework, then once you know the bits that a framework is taking over for you use a framework for future work rather than re-solving things that not only have been solved, by solved by *you*, again. 'Course, this is time and effort that could also be used on other matters. It comes down to what you want to know, and what you think you need to know.",

Using a framework may be the only supported way to access certain features on a particular system.

(took me a while and im still confused, learned a lot tho)\n\nThink I will do some code crafter projects now.\n\nPoint is, if you just wanna code, find some lower level stuff to do. Look up how to make packet listeners, and code a packet listener on a network to detect suspect activity. Make your own tcp server and learn how to parse http requests.\n\nReally take anything you like, go one level lower and ask, \"well how does that work?\" then learn and work on that. That is what I do now after much of what ur feeling.\n\nits also useful to build stuff that you will use, but for me I can never thing of stuff i want/use so yeah...",

Starting something new lets you forget the hiccups in your current scope. \nI get it. I’ve started way more projects than I’ve finished—they’ve fallen to the wayside. But the real answer is mindset, discipline, and focusing on progress over perfection.\n\nJust aim to complete it. Aesthetics can wait. Once the hard part is done, you can enjoy polishing it up or not. Who cares? It’s done. \n\nFinishing projects creates a positive feedback loop. Knowing you completed something and uploaded it to your portfolio is the best feeling. Plus, now you get to start something new without the guilt of quitting the last one.\n\nAs for HTML and CSS, use UI components. For game dev, just grab free or cheap assets.\n\n I’m a programmer, too. I never make 3D models because I’m not an artist. I’ve got another post on goal setting I’d recommend checking out. And if you really just want to finish a project, I’d suggest freelancing it gives you a driving force and a reason to complete the work.\n\nGood luck 👍",

A whole lot of different physical phenomena can be modeled on a computer using programming. Some programs aim broadly. A [physics engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_engine?wprov=sfla1) might implement rigid body dynamics, inverse kinematics, collision detection, fluid dynamics, and softbody dynamics. Maybe even all of them at the same time.  A [CFD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFD-DEM?wprov=sfla1) solver, on the other hand, is more specialized.\n\nI think one term you should take a look at is [computational physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_physics?wprov=sfla1). See especially the part about applications. See also [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis?wprov=sfla1), a topic that physical simulation heavily relies on. You may also find [discrete mathematics ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics?wprov=sfla1) illuminating.

All that previous experience just made it click.\n\nIn the end, most languages follow the same core principles—just different syntax, which you can always look up. Some languages just express certain ideas more naturally than others. Since you’re just starting out, explore a few. It’ll make you better in the long run because you’re learning to apply the same concepts in different forms. They all have a stack and heap, you will grokk them when your curiosity strikes. ",

You just need to get some hands on practice and you'll shake the rust off. The imposter syndrome never goes away forever, but honestly one of the main reasons it comes back is because the paradox of knowledge (the more you learn, the more you realize you don't know yet). Its perfectly normal, and you'll get better at managing it with time/experience (and by being around others who experience it).\n\n2. The rest of this sounds like textbook depressive symptoms, and is best handled by a professional, not us chuds on reddit. Its nasty and will really get inside your head as you've described, but you seem to be just trying to white-knuckle it and out-intellectualize it, which is the worst thing you can do for it (besides completely ignore it, of course). A qualified mental health professional will be able to help you manage depressive symptoms in a way nobody here is going to remotely be able to come close to, and that's really  the important thing here. You had good instincts taking care of your health first, keep following that and the rest will come back",

Why do you study CS? What do you want to achieve exactly? Target something to shoot at. This is very important. \n* Estimate your capabilities. How much time do you have? How much effort can you give? Are there any financial barriers? Are there any responsibilities around you that force you to go in a specific path? Identify carefully what you can do and what you can't. \n* After you identify your needs, look for the roadmap that fits your capabilities. General roadmaps like those we see online, in my opinion, aren't for everyone. The best roadmap for you is what's uniquely made for your current situation. You may ask someone who's a software industry professional to help you with that. You may, for example, browse job offers of the track you want to study and see exactly what's frequently required by those companies. The outcome of this step is \"What skills/knowledge I should have to achieve my goal.\"\n* Now, your way is clear. According to that roadmap, you gotta look at what you have and what you haven't in terms of skills/knowledge and try to work on it. Starting from scratch isn't a bad thing, it helps to refresh your mind and fill the gaps in your knowledge. Remember, you aren't someone who has never dealt with programming in their life, you have some experience. \n* Finally, *\"كل علم ليس في القرطاس ضاع\"  .. \"Knowledge that is not in the paper is indeed lost.\" ..* Note down EVERYTHING you learn. Our minds work like RAM; you will forget about something new you learnt just a few days later. Programs like Obsidian are great for that purpose, and you can sync your notes folder (called a \"vault\") freely using Google Drive Desktop so you will never lose your progress.\n\n  \nGood luck, Okhti!",

This is very difficult to do, especially for people with no group project experience.\n\nWhat works a lot better is to code together at first, taking turns \"driving.\" This sort of forces you to do the integration first. You figure out the overall structure together, making sure everyone's concerns are addressed. Suddenly you realize you have started working on some code that can clearly be split off to work independently, because the disagreements have waned. Only then do you split it off. At this point everyone understands all sides of the interface better, so you know when you need to communicate again.\n\nIn fact, I'd give good odds that the part of your team that is meshing well did something similar, where your problematic team mate went to independent mode ASAP.",

It is possible to avoid, but that is also a pain.\n\n> What benefits does that actually bring? \n\nIt allows separate teams to evolve their own database design without fear that they might unknowingly break some other service somewhere else. \n\nIt also prevents database locks across services. Let's say we had a \"user\" table that two services use. Now, let's say that the first service does a huge update that locks the entire table... well... now you've blown up the second service, and the team responsible for that service has no clue what is going on.\n\n\n> From my perspective, it justs adds more complexity, and for what? organization? \n\nComplexity in terms of infrastructure, maybe. Complexity in terms of distributing data? Sure. However, it allows each service to scale and exist independently, which is why you want microservices.",

Absolutely.\n\nThe purpose is load-handling. If you've got 150,000 active users on your site, doing all the things users do from creating new accounts, posting, retrieving things, etc. then your poor RDB is getting hammered.\n\nIf you have a microservice that just handles user stuff, it's handling maybe 1,000 of those users. Your posting service is handling maybe 5,000 users, you're search feature is handling...80,000 users. And each of those services is pretty much working on one table of a database, then the queries are super fast and not being blocked, versus some nightmare RDB queries or inserts that lock tables, and so on.\n\nDo you *need* to do microservices? Not necessarily for everything. We had a site where we had about 40 tables, and only two of them had a load that was worrying. We also had plenty of tricks up our sleeves to make that load manageable (Redis, caching, partitioning, etc).

You can certainly render 3D graphics with Python if you want.\n\nPython is popular for indie games because it's generally considered to be an easy language to learn, and it generally takes less effort to write something in Python than it does in C++.  You don't see Python used a lot outside of the indie scene because, for one, it's much slower than C++, and also because it's an interpreted language, and commercial game developers generally do not want people to be able to easily open up and read through their source code.\n\nIf you want to write a visual novel, I'd consider looking into [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/), an incredibly popular and well-developed Python engine for visual novels.  But otherwise?  Honestly, consider looking into C# instead.  There's a huge community of indie devs that use it, it's faster than Python, and it doesn't have the memory management issues that cause a lot of problems for people using C++.",

Great licensing rules as well.\n\nUnity is a bit tricky to learn I didn't just intuitively know how to use it like Godot. It can handle VR better due to C# but with a much higher skill celling and not as good licensing rules. \n\nHop over to YouTube and check out \"Brackeys\" channel if you'd like to see both engines to gage what you like more. \n\nI currently work in Unreal(C++) since nether above system can keep up with the IR/Imu/ Lazer loads gracefully.

Imagine you have a function that is called calcUserData ehich gets a user and does some processing. In this case you would only care about the processing part, as that is the main functionality of this function. Problen is now that this function calls the db to get the user data, and wr of course dont want to include that in the unit test as we ONLY want to test the function.\n\nThis is were you use testing doubles as you mentioned, mocks, fakes and stubs. Mocks tell you if an interaction happened, for example you can check if the database function getUserData was actually called by calcUserData.\n\nFakes are working implementations but simplified. Lets say that instead of mocking away the database, you want to use an in memory db, or you could even store values into a list if all you want is something to put in and retrieve data from.\n\nStubs are when you want to pre-define a response. Imagine you have a function called isAdmin, which simply checks the db if the user is an admin or not, instead of actually calling the db we can simply stub it to return True or False. This is useful when you want to force an interaction. Imagine you want to test if you correctly throw an error to the user if they are not an admin, you can do that with stubbing.\n\nThe mindset you need for unit testing is using these 3 tools to force yourself to ONLY test what a small piece of code does. The mistake people make is including dependencies into unit tests which makes them closer to integration tests.\n\nHope this helped a bit, in a rush need to go to work now but if you have any more questions just comment Ill get back to you.",

If you knew exactly how to do the calculation, the job would only be to write the program - but as you didn't, you had to truly understand the solution, understand how to solve the problem outside of a program, before writing the code. \n\nA lot of programming is exactly that: first understanding how to do something, and then making the computer do it for you. And if you like that kind of thing, you'll do great!\n\nI suck at math, but mostly the kind I've never had to use actively. Calculus is like a complete mystery to me - although I understand derivatives and slope calculations just fine, I've never gotten the hang of integrals. Also have never had to use them in any applications. I've written quite a bit of 2D games, and are really good at trigonometry and simple vector calculations - but I've never worked in 3D, and still don't quite get matrices.\n\nI would like to learn the math before I have to use it - but I've always found that I can't. If I'm not going to use it in a program right now, I can't learn it. The moment I have to use it, I struggle for a while with learning it, and ask myself why I didn't just learn it before ... and the cycle goes ever on :)",

But if any intermediate node changes, you have to recalculate or invalidate all the caches below it. (So if changes mostly happen at the leaves, you're super fast. But if changes often happen up the tree you're spending a lot of time recalculating to keep the index current.)\n\nIf certain calculations are more likely than others, and depending on how long the math takes, you could consider some kind of lookup table or hash for common calculations. It'll take more space, but if it could save you time per calculation that might be worth it to you.\n\nVideo cards love matrix math. Look for a library in your language that will let you send big batches of matrix math to the gpu?",

        "body": "This may or may not be relevant. I was fairly convinced in my sophomore year of undergrad (studying CS) that I wasn't going to be a professional coder (I decided I'd go to law school after graduation, with the intent of going into patent law, which is what I do now).  I did it for a number of reasons, some of which included that I didn't love programming all that much and I wasn't naturally good at it.  \n\nBeing around people who were absolutely brilliant at programming and building things really made me feel pretty bad about where I was at. I could do my courses just fine and ended up graduating with honors, but I never built my own projects or anything, I just did my course work.  \n\nAnyway, I have no idea if the additional two years for you would look anything like my last two years, but I did them just fine. I learned a lot, and a lot of it was both interesting and relevant to my ultimate career. I also build things now as hobby projects occasionally, even though I don't do it professionally.  \n\nAnyway, all this to say, I was able to do my junior and senior years in CS just fine, even knowing that I wasn't going to be programming professionally and also believing I was just bad at it compared to some of my brilliant peers.  \n\nI guess I'd encourage the BS instead of the associate's, because it will probably open more doors to you.  \n\nAs far as discipline and motivation, could you maybe talk to a few of your friends at school and say, hey I'd really like to build something but I'm having trouble on my own. Could we form a small group and build something together? That would keep you accountable not just to yourself, but your friends as well.\n\nOn the, \"I want to learn but I suck at this,\" piece, I think you need to break your problem down into smaller, more manageable chunks. If one task is just too overwhelming, break it up into smaller, easier to understand pieces, and solve them one by one. Ask for help from a friend, a professor, a TA, Reddit, Discord, or even AI for things you just really cannot solve. \n\nAlso, sucking at something you haven't learned yet is, in fact, the normal, natural state. That's how you get better: you start with sucking at it, you work on it, you get better, you work some more, you get better, and so on. \n\nI don't know what projects you've done for your classes, but start with those. Which ones did you do well on? Take what you did and do it again, but a little different, a little better. Add a feature. Maybe you did a sorting algorithm, like Quicksort, on integers. Do it again, but on floats or doubles. Do it again with individual characters, then character strings. Do it so that the sort is by length of the string rather than its actual value. Do it with templates so you can generically sort any type. Try building a visualization for it. Then whatever language you originally learned it in, try it in a different language. Try it in seven different languages, then pick the one you end up liking the most and try something new in that language.\n\nDo the same thing but for a project you didn't do well on. Make it better. \n\nForce yourself to take those two projects, and build something that uses both of them to do a third thing. Challenge your creativity. \n\nJust a bunch of thoughts on things you could do.  \n\nAnother thing you can try, get on ChatGPT or Gemini or something, tell it what concepts you know, and ask it to give you an idea for a project you can build with those concepts. Then go build it. Give yourself a deadline and stick to it. Tell your friends and family, \"I'm building this thing, I'm going to have it done by this date, I would love to show it to you that day so you can see what I'm working on.\" Now you're accountable to them to get the thing done.",

This is a far more general problem than just programming, and you probably need to examine the rest of your life to look for how to fix it - maybe you need to be getting up earlier and going to the gym, maybe you need to eat better, maybe you need to detox from social media or tiktok or video games. You know your life, I don't.\n\nThere are definitely some things you can do to make it more fun. Absolutely find a passion project like a Minecraft mod to work on.

Now I find myself running through documentation and also reading others peoples code on github. \n\n>How do you build discipline when you often lose motivation or feel stuck early on?\n\nMotivation is a tricky thing because its what initially drives you to pursue the thing and then discipline is what keeps you going, all I can say is as things get easier and clearer you will be more likely to continue it is a struggle at first for sure. When you get stuck and you feel like you cant continue take a break and come back there have been so many times where I struggled on something then randomly during my day I figure it out.\n\n>Would you still recommend finishing the last 2 years of a CS bachelor if programming doesn't come naturally to you?\n\nAbsolutely. I am a firm believer that programming doesnt come naturally to anyone for the most part its really just about practice and lots of it.\n\n>Are there any beginner-friendly project ideas that helped *you* break the tutorial cycle?\n\nStart with something simple like rock paper scissors and progressively move up in difficulty, AI is actually pretty good at giving you ideas on this so you can use that.\n\n\n\n>Do you think making a Minecraft mod (or something similar I personally enjoy) is a good way to get into coding?\n\nYea tons of people start off doing game modding as an introduction whatever will make you keep doing it the very next day. \n\n  \nTake a step back write a bunch of small programs and then move up slowly in difficulty understand the language you are using so you dont add additional struggle by needing to think of syntax when you are programming.",

See if you can publish it somewhere. If/when you do get a job, the programming position is more than just programming so this experience will be helpful.

Nothing special, but I've found it very useful. Create your own. The more you use it. The more you use it, the more that anyone uses it, the more likely you will come back to do bug fixes and updates. \n\nIf you are interested in addons/extensions for games, this is fun as well. Create something simple, even if it already exists and publish it so others can use it. I did this for World of Warcraft. When you see 1,000 downloads it's really exciting to get back in there to do bug fixes or add more. When a new expansion comes out, I have more updates to do. \n\nWhen you have a valid reason to program, it becomes easier to stick with it.

Instead of looking at the (currently unreachable) summit of the mountain, you only look at the path ahead of you, at your next step(s), which are absolutely in reach. The better you break down the problem, the easier it will be to solve each individual sub-problem. Once you have solutions for your sub problems (best on paper, in pseudo code, flow charts, bullet lists, whatever works for you), start implementing them in code.

Simplify it over and over and over again until you get something doable at your still level. (So I can’t make *all that* but I could probably make a text based rock paper scissors game that runs in the command line.)\n4. Try to build it. If you succeed, you’re done. Try to build something more complex next time. If you get stuck, move onto the next step. (Let’s say I get stuck on IO—I know how to read it but I don’t know how to normalize it, so that “Rock” and “rock” and “r” all count as the same thing.)\n5. Now that you know what you don’t know, go investigate that thing. (At this stage, I would look at the documentation or ask someone or something how strings works in my language, etc.)\n6. If the thing you’re stuck on turns out to be a fairly large topic, shelve your current project and dive into this new topic. (If I’m working in Rust, there’s some nuance to strings that is worth mastering early, so I might abandon my project for now until I figure this stuff out.)\n7. Incorporate your new knowledge into your project, or if you’re feeling really inspired make a completely separate project that exercises your grasp on this new information. (I could go back to RPS and implement the string interface, I might build some kind of `echo` program that reads my input and prints a normalized version of it)\n\nThe first three steps are mainly to help get you started. They can be skipped or reduced if you already have an idea of something you want to build. The main point is that hitting a wall is not a bad thing.

The student might want a custom lecture, want it recorded or transcribed, then be hand-held through solving the problems, and, one more thing, they have to be available when the student is available. I'm exaggerating, of course.\n\nWhen you see posters looking for help, they want someone to motivate them, figure out stuff when they get stuck, keep it interesting. Some students are given assignments, but then come back and said \"things got busy\" and they didn't have time to do what was being asked, so the mentor decides the student wants too much, but isn't serious about doing stuff on their own.\n\nOne key is to level-set between mentor and student. The mentor should ask the student what they expect, i.e., how much time per week, what they expect the interaction to look like, etc. A potential mentor would express their expectations. Hopefully, they could find an agreement.\n\nFrom the student perspective, I'm sure they'd prefer free over paying, and they would be concerned, if they did pay, that the mentor was any good (presumably, they could quit if it wasn't working well).\n\nIt's also a challenge to mentor well. A mentor needs to be aware of what the student needs and what they can provide. Some people over-explain going on and on with a concept not realizing the student has tuned out. They don't get the student to do some tasks during their meetings to keep things active.\n\nIntermediate programmers might fare better because they already know some programming. The student has to know what they want from a mentor and the mentor has to know what they want to offer.\n\nLook at the topics in this subreddit. Many are looking for a first language to learn, or they're worried about AI, or they need motivation to do something. I doubt the creators of this subreddit expected those kinds of posts to dominate the subreddit.",

In my experience the mentor finds you not the other way around which sucks cuz it can take time\n\n  \nAs a mentor\n\nEVERYONE wants a mentor.  There just isn't enough time and enough mentors.  Most ppl are unwilling to actually do the work or things suggested.  I'm not saying this is you or everyone but a lot of ppl don't truly understand what a mentor does and just expects us to hold their hand and give them a job from out connections.  This is also why I think the mentor finds you not the other way around because we wait until we see someone showing the signs of someone that can actually benefit from a mentor\n\n  \n\\-  Would you pay for a 1:1 mentor\n\nThis is really up to you and I \"personally\" don't like charging but I could completely see why someone would and have charged in the past for ppl that aren't local to me.  I tried doing a discord server/meetup online and ppl just weren't as serious in my experience like they are when we do it locally and I think it's cuz of the low cost of entry to just click \"join server/meeting\".  \n\nYou are paying for this whether you have a mentor or not.  You are either paying financial to move forward in time with their help OR you are paying in time having to figure it all out yourself.  \n\nI know their are sites out there (I have not used them so I can't say if they are good or bad just know they exist) [mentorcruise.com](http://mentorcruise.com) and [codingcouch.io](http://codingcouch.io)",

Usually this is just for very low level networking code, but you'll want to at least consider it for save files if you transfer those between machines.\n\nAs for unions... They're kind of an outdated way to solve a problem you shouldn't have very often in a weird way, if you're using strictly C you'll probably still need them here and there but for modern C++ you should consider `std::variant` in most cases you'd reach for a union, maybe `std::any` for some niche cases. \n\nOne big problem with unions is that they occupy as much memory as their largest member - so over-using them for primitives will definitely mess up your memory usage and alignment. \n\nAnother issue is that they're riddled with undefined behavior - writing to one union member and then reading from another is not technically allowed, but your program will compile anyways. UB is something to be rightfully scared of.\n\nTL;DR - you'd be better served by keeping a consistent internal float representation and only caring about endian-ness at communication boundaries than relying on a feature that comes with footguns.",

Its like drawing rectangles under a curve for the first 2 weeks of calc 1 ... if you got the concept 30 min into it, the next 2 weeks are blah blah.\n\nTake data structures: almost all modern languages have either these built into the language or libraries where they are done for you.  It serves you no purpose to build a linked list out of pointers in C; first, its inefficient (page faults), second its error prone (pointers and inexperience don't mix), and thirdly as I said, its already there to be used in a library or language innate.  What you need to know is when to use what data structures, and that isn't even well explained in the courses (they focus on reinventing them, not how to use them!).  So go review a web site (not AI generated, find a human written one) on when to use what data structures.\n\nBig-O is just a jargon notation.  Its like the math class on convergence of sequences (if you had that one?) where you examine the dominating term to see if it converges on infinity... except here we look for it to converge on an exponent.  So bubble sort, where you go over the whole list of say numbers, find the smallest one, move it one location at a time until it gets to the top, repeat for the list except ignore the top item, then next time ignore the top 2 items...  converges on N\\*N amount of work being done to sort the data, which you can review online how to get there but its 2 nested loops effectively over N each, so its not too hard to see (this one).  Proving an algorithm takes however many operations is helpful to know if its good at its job.  The good news is that studying algorithms will include an explanation of how to do big-O & use it.\n\nWhich leads me to algorithms.  While a LOT of algorithms are included in languages and libraries, you still need to study them and to be able to solve your own problems using either the known common ones strung together or a totally new thing.  I advise you to then do a quick overview of datastructures as I said above, and after that, do a pretty solid study of intro to algorithms and keep on digging into it as deep as you think is useful.  I recommend not getting trapped/bogged down in graphs or graph theory unless you think you will be using that stuff (its pretty rare in most fields).\n\nafter those, study object oriented programming if you have not gone deep into it.  The last thing to do is design patterns, which require an in depth understanding of OOP & other basics or much of what these are doing will not make sense.\n\navoid leet code.  Its like tricky word problems in a math class more than practical programming.   It can be fun, but in real life, no one will actively try to confuse you with the requirements and if they do, you can ask questions.  Hit it up SOME, but don't \"grind\" it.  The most useful thing it will teach you is how unexpected inputs and edge cases can really mess up something you thought you had working.  THAT is useful and practical!",

Also this place is for asking programming questions and your question isn't really about programming. It sounds like you are being put in a situation where you are made responsible for much more than you should be responsible for. But that's nothing new. \n\nas is pointed out, the same traffic split over multiple applications would act very similar (if not better) than the same traffic in one application. \n\nHowever you mentioned asp / old technology. Most modern webpages run mostly in the frontend (webbrowser) with only occasional calls being made to the backend to fetch data. this makes it much easier on the webserver since it only needs to put out data rather than generate html.\n\nold style applications would do a new request for each click (next page, sort, submit) and that request would generate the entire html page that the end-user sees.  \n\nif this is the case for you then there definitely is going to be load on the server when there is sufficient traffic. Additionally it is possible that if you maintain session state at the server side there are inefficiencies there (too much state is kept, using up all the memory)\n\nfrom the documentation about web forms: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/what-is-web-forms\n\n> When users request a page, it is compiled and executed on the server by the framework, and then the framework generates the HTML markup that the browser can render. An ASP.NET Web Forms page presents information to the user in any browser or client device.\n\nso yes, web forms likely does serverside rendering of the page. which means it can be slow because the server has to do (relatively speaking) a lot of work for each request and it can be slow because all the html the client wants to display has to be loaded for each page request. Modern frameworks tend to load a website as a single page application (well not all but plenty) which then needs minimal callbacks to the server.\n\nso yes I suspect in your case it is possible that switching to another framework can speed things up\n\nhowever it's not as simple as saying: you use x, that is why it is slow. it may be a resource problem, a bottleneck in the database or other resources, it could be any number of things. It's important to start measuring. look at the server cpu usage when your websites are under load. look at the memory usage. if possible, see if you can attach a profiler to you server and see where the cpu cycles and such go. \n\nHowever if you're a junior (this is learn programming after all) you shouldn't be doing any of these things.",

He was tasked with providing some type information when linking two C object files (one of C's capabilities is to compile a program like `foo.c` into an object file called `foo.o`. There's also a `foo.h` which is a header file that other C programs can reference if they want to call functions defined in `foo.c`. However, the standard C linker which combines .o files doesn't really check the types in the header file to see if they matched).\n\nThe idea was to produce a better checker prior to linking object files. Instead, the guy got fascinated with parsing challenging C structures. He didn't know how to do that. Despite that, it was a solved problem. The goal of the project was to do some kind of research project on something new.\n\nThe prof. said he needed \"taste\", that is, to pick problems that need to be solved and not to spend time on problems that have been solved, even if you didn't know how to solve it.\n\nOf course, *someone* has to learn it. Some people, like you, have a need to know, even if that rabbit hole is tremendous. It probably feels like a more well-defined problem than the one you're working on?

I've seen people who want to learn a new programming language, and a new web framework, and work on some project they have no idea how to get started. They don't budget the time it takes to learn all of that. They justify it by saying they'll learn new things, but have no contingency if they run out of time.\n\nMy suggestion is to find out who has more experience, your friend with React or you with Angular or if one of you can pick stuff up quickly. Or do both. Plan out a rough idea of what needs to get done, and how it would be done with Angular and React.\n\nIn the meanwhile, give yourself about a week or two to learn Django (or use Flask, which is allegedly lighter weight and might be easier to learn). Build out a super simple web app (to-do) just to see the steps needed. If you're still mired in Django and Flask after two weeks and realize it's too much to learn, then go back to the technology you already know.\n\nIf you can start learning Django and Flash right now, you can see how fast you can learn it. I would suggest regular meetings (every day) and perhaps in person if you can manage it during this process. Essentially, you are waiting for a go or no go scenario (go meaning yes, do it in Django/Flask, and no go meaning go back to something familiar).",

As for the return value, that is up to you (the domain expert would not care in that case). But the idea of a default button being selected (as either 'yes' or 'no') is definitely in the domain of the UI/UX.\n\nFor example, when you click \"close\" and the document is not yet saved, you may get a box like \"do you want to save your changes - yes/no\" and the default should definitely be \"yes\" for that.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are about to perform an action which is hard/impossible to undo (like \"empty recycle bin\"), then for that the default should be \"no\".

If you are doing it just because \"si\" is 2 characters (1 character shorter than \"yes\"), then that's not a good reason.\n\nOTOH if you are using it for localization purposes (e.g. in standard French, \"si\" is used only for responding \"no/yes\" to negative questions, and perhaps in other languages too, like in Dutch/German how toch/doch is used to contradict), then that might be interesting or important. So if you have a compelling reason to put this in the API (e.g. to help localization), then that would be OK but you should make it intuitive for the programmer and explain it in the docs or in the header or wherever the programmer normally reads up on how to use your code.",

Try to get unstuck by looking at W3Schools (I.e. the primary source you are learning from; for a C++ programmer this could be [cppreference.com](http://cppreference.com), for example, instead).\n2. Try to get unstuck by Googling in general.\n3. Try to get unstuck by posting a question on Reddit.\n4. Try to get unstuck by asking AI.\n\nSo, this list is not bad on its face, but I think you're missing a \"step 0\" that should come first (or \"zeroth\" in programmer-speak) -- that is, to try to get unstuck by using your own brain \"first of all\" and using what you already know in your brain and with your 'hands' (e.g. by launching your own debugger or using your own preferred debugging techniques like adding assert's, printf-debugging, etc.). That is, try to first \"do it yourself\" for at least a good 5-10 minutes, or some amount that you determine. If things get frustrating, then you'll feel when it's time to throw in the towel. But if you develop the habit of \"throwing in the towel\" immediately when you encounter a gotcha, and if you're always rushing off somewhere else all the time, then to me this sounds like it's going to weaken your mental muscles of problem solving.\n\nBy the way, solving the problem yourself (during the imaginary \"step 0\" of the above), this is the part that feels pretty good to our brains. It's the part that makes programming 'addictive' in a positive way. Sure, maybe your solution won't be as nice or pretty as what you found on the Top Result of Google/StackOverflow/Reddit/whatever; it won't have all the nice textbook-style comments that AI-generated code tends to have (personally I hate those, and usually ask AI-generators to exclude them) but 99% of the time in real programming, you don't \\*need\\* the \"prettiest\" solution, you just need a solution that works.\n\nSo, let's assume for a moment that you can most likely find a solution yourself (a skill which you'll get better at if you practice), and let's assume that your solution doesn't need to be \"top-StackOverflow-post-worthy\" in terms of beauty and super-correctness (99% of the time, real solutions in the real world don't need to be that). Then it seems to me that it behooves us as programmers to spend most of our initial effort in the \"step 0\" part of the above problem-solving/issue-resolution 'algorithm'.

I have studied computer science in college and nearing the end of my undergraduate so I’ve seen quite a few different things in college. My best advice is I guess is to try different things and see what you prefer, you can’t know what you like until you do it. However attending college and studying something that turns out to be the wrong course for you is a horrible feeling. Do online classes like codecamp, bro code, try out different things. If ur into game dev or want to try it out, look up classes or online tutorials for blender, unreal, unity,… If u want to learn any type of coding, the basics are the same for all programming languages just a different syntax (way of typing code depending on the programming language). You can’t really start learning any of the more advanced topics without basic programming knowledge. Every type of application always has different ways to be build, not every company works with the same software. Mobile development for example isn’t done with html and css like a web application, web apps usually use frameworks to speed up the development process so even if you know html and css it’s not enough, depending on the job you want you’ll still have to learn managing and implementing a database for example making a mvc application with .net in c# and framework.core to make a full stack web application. There are a lot of different jobs and topics, start with doing what you think interests you the most. Learns some front end coding and some backend and you’ll quickly find out what you prefer by actually doing stuff. All that said, do some research about programming languages, what they are usually used for, decide what you want to start first and if you found something you really like than maybe you can find a school about the topics or computer science to get a degree. Or find another way to get experience and land a job, even if u decide to study in college you will already have seen some topics.",

The percentage of jobs probably lines up to the statement with likely.  \nWith web development I’d be surprised if there is much C coding.  There are a large percentage of coding jobs in web development.  \n\nMost of the work I’ve done is Java, C# , C/C++ and Python in the last 10 years. \n\nI’ve probably written 5 large scale solutions in the last 15 years in C for professional work.  The number goes up drastically for C++ \nI’ve written many hobby C programs for embedded devices though.  \n\nI’m also not a high performance trading developer nor a dedicated hard core software engineering problem solver.  I would expect more use of C in these jobs but I’d also expect a smaller percentage of the total job market 5-10% maybe ? \n\nI’m more of a trading and platform integration specialist.

This is really the essence of computer science: as you come to understand common patterns in the work you're doing, you make tools to allow yourself to work more easily within those patterns, at the expense of some of the flexibility you have when working without them. So languages wrap other languages, and within languages code wraps other code -- a lot of the work is in figuring out which patterns are so valuable it's worth codifying them.",

Essentially the idea behind it is to expose API as a set of arbitrary *functions* and let the API clients call those functions.\n\nThe idea behind **REST** is to not expose functions per se, but to expose *resources* to let client directly manipulate them (read, make changes, make new ones, etc.). You can think of RPC functions as *verbs*. Meanwhile resources are *nouns*, and there's a limited set of verbs representing actions on those nouns. Specifically, the verbs are different HTTP request methods: GET, POST, DELETE, etc.\n\n**With REST APIs** you often can get the idea what you can or cannot do with it by looking at the available resources. Like, for an imaginary Reddit API you would see the resource `comment` and would assume that:\n\n`GET /api/comments?post_id=xyz`\n\nwould give you all comments for a specific Reddit post.\n\n**With RPC** this can be something like `getCommentsForPost(xyz)`, and gRPC would convert it to a protobuf on the way to and from the server.\n\nBoth approaches have **pros and cons**. REST became popular when many people started building APIs for web apps and mobile apps and used many different languages to make them. At the time the primary RPC technology was SOAP and XML-WebServices (essentially the same thing as gRPC except with XML and not protobuf), and not many languages had libraries for SOAP. With REST if your language could speak HTTP you were ready to use it.\n\nEven today, like you said gRPC is faster and theoretically should replace REST for everything, except that outside of about top 5 / top 10 most popular languages support for it is almost non-existent. Last time I worked with gRPC was about 5-6 years ago, and at the time there was no convenient way to make RPC calls from a web page, so the largest proportion of potential clients couldn't use it at all. I haven't looked at it since, to be honest.\n\nIn practice, REST can be fast enough for many / most situations, so people keep using it because it's convenient.",

Protocol buffers are more space + time efficient for message passing than JSON.\n2. gRPC is set up over HTTP 2, which means you can send many messages with less TCP/HTTP connection overhead (in a nutshell, many requests can share connections)\n\nAdvantage #1 doesn't require gRPC, you *could* protocol buffer encode your messages and send around binary payloads if you wanted to. This advantage doesn't actually apply very much to strings or small integers, so jumping through the hoops of defining and distributing protocol buffer definition files isn't really worth the effort usually.\n\nAs for advantage #2, this is actually something REST *can* have as well with HTTP 3, and depending on your network topology you can get the main benefits here without having to re-write any of your application code.\n\ngRPC is a godsend if you have internal services that are quite chatty with each other and are paying all the network/CPU bills for all of them, since the serialization cost and wire size is strictly better and sometimes better by a noticeable (double-digit percentage) margin. Protocol buffers are also quite nice because they allow you to generate message passing logic for multiple languages, meaning you don't have to write a lot of overhead to translate to/from JSON when your C++ data chugging service is talking to your NodeJS client-facing websocket server - but that only saves you effort if distributing/consuming that generated code is easy.",

For example:\n\n- To use protobuf you need a code generation step where you transform your proto files into the actual interfaces you implement + objects you use. It may not always be easy to integrate this into your build system in a seamless way, depending on your setup.\n- You'll also probably want to write some sort of wrapper to smooth out some of the tedium of launching your server and creating your clients.\n- Sharing protobuf definitions between different repos is a bit of a PITA, last I checked.\n\nThese factors mean that:\n\n1. For smaller companies or projects, you'll probably see negligible overhead from using plain-old HTTP + JSON. So, it's often not worth the effort of setting up gRPC + protobuf: the speed boost isn't big enough to justify switching for many.\n2. Using gRPC + protobuf _can_ be worth it for larger companies. However, you'll most likely use it purely internally and continue using HTTP + JSON for your externally-facing API -- the browser support for gRPC is not quite there. If your API is something designed for others to use, you'll also have to take into account that most users of your public API will (statistically speaking) be smaller companies or hobbyists that cannot or do not want to use gRPC + protobuf. So if you want to maximize adoption, you'll have to stick with the least common denominator, which is HTTP + JSON.",

        "body": "I was lucky to use it at a later stage (late 2000s), and by that time most glaring problems with SOAP were generally \"solved\".\n\nAll these WS-* standards were not pedantically defined, and in practice Java tools were doing whatever .NET tools were doing and vice versa. Both Microsoft, and Sun-Oracle and IBM were working really hard to make sure that the two sides of the ecosystem had seamless experience. But if you were \"outside\" of those two stacks you were in for subtle bugs.\n\nHowever, I worked on projects that were Java and .NET, and for us it was pretty awesome. When you needed to connect two services the two teams would sit down, design a WSDL file, and then our tools would generate both client and server code *and test stubs* so we could test (or run) the rest of the application without having the other service running. Both languages had top tier IDEs, so if, say you wanted to load patient appointments you'd fire up the autocomplete, and it would find types for requests and response messages, data validators, etc.\n\nIf you find something missing you'd ring up the other team, you would agree to changes to WSDL, and then both teams would regenerate code and the IDE would instantly highlight all places where the code was broken. I worked on a medical project like this at some point, and the teams of dozens of developers (both Java and .NET) worked on individual services for months without actually running the full system ever (That was the time before CI was widespread). We finally had a demo scheduled, we connected the real endpoints, and you would think it all would brow up spectacularly. But no! The stuff actually worked! Our WSDLs had thousands of lines in them, and we had, like, 5 functions where things didn't work as expected (people passing wrong IDs or assuming different time zones, you know the drill.).\n\nSo, all things considered, it was a pretty cool set of tech. The devil was in a details. Despite everything, XML was annoying to work with, the generated types may have fields with stupid names (`field1`, `field2`, or `meaningfulName0` or something). If you wanted to debug this code you'd have to send XMLs with a tool called SOAP UI (it's like Postman, but much worse and in Java). Messages had a lot of wrapper tags with XML namespaces in them and tons of unnecessary meta-info. Both Sun and Microsoft insisted that the best way to make some classes in your favorite language, and then let *them* generate WSDL, all the tutorials showed that, and not how to work with WSDL-first approach. So people who were excited about how simple it looked in the examples were in for a very rude awakening. All in all, it was a very strong tech on a \"strategic\" level, but day-to-day as a single engineer on one of those projects you didn't really enjoyed it, and I can easily see how people would say it was PITA! Especially, those who worked with it in its earlier years when half of things it promised didn't really work. I remember at the time I was not a fan of WS and SOAP at all, but over the years and looking back I started to appreciate it more.\n\nWith gRPC Google took the main idea: have a protocol defined in a spec file (new WSDL), and use code gen for every language. They improved a lot of stuff: the new spec file format - proto - is much nicer, it works with a lot more languages, there's a lot less ceremony and special tools involved. But they also made a few decisions to make the whole thing annoying in its own way. Like, making it binary only which is bad for observability, require an exotic transport, having web browser support as an afterthought, etc. So, while objectively I liked my time with SOAP *somewhat* I'm not really rushing to try gRPC.\n\nFunny thing: SOAP was not the first either, before that we had CORBA and DCOM in the 90s and some proprietary stuff from Unix vendors in the 80s. And like every other thing in our profession RPC, too, was invented at Xerox. [The guy who coined the term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Jay_Nelson) even came up with the general design: have a file for interface definition, use it to generate stubs, all messages and RPC calls are type-checked to prevent bugs.",

Or will I learn to design websites and create apps?\n\nCS will be minimally *about* programming, but programming will be a tool that you use to demonstrate what you've learned. Imagine being an English major: you'd do a lot of reading and writing, but your classes wouldn't be primarily *about* reading or writing, though you might take some classes to help you improve your skill as a reader and writer. It's the same with computer science: you'll learn about algorithms, logic, operating systems, compilers, theory of computation, maybe some digital electronics, databases, networking, security, AI, plenty of math, and so on. You'll write code in many of those classes, and you'll have some classes that are specifically about programming, but your degree will be in computer science, not programming.\n\nYou should look at the degree requirements for the computer science program at your school to find out specifically what lies ahead.",

If you are unable to remain secure in a job, whether it's due to trigger-happy CEO's, being unlucky enough to be placed in an unprofitable team, or having no mobility to really learn about multiple stacks outside of your team's remit, the benefits of working in big tech aren't there any more.\n\n* The high TC is irrelevant, because it goes to zero on a whim\n* You won't have enough time to learn anything significant, and in times of churn you won't be afforded that time anyway.\n* Many people in big tech work on *unsexy* parts of the stack. You could make senior having worked solely on a CRUD app, or be a L4 junior working on the bleeding edge with a ton of responsibility. A lot of people leave and realise that they've learned nothing useful.\n* Prestige doesn't exist. It barely ever did, but it definitely doesn't now.\n* The average tenure is around 18-24 months.

Is it being treated as a sign of poor performance and not as an opportunity for your growth as an engineer? Do you understand the reasoning behind their comments? Do your seniors explain it if you ask? Is it presented professionally? What happens when you deliver questions or feedback on the senior's output? \n\nI get that CR comments can be curt and can be nitpicky. That can be part of making the code better. Ours is a world that requires a fair degree of technical precision in our language and in our execution. In of itself, I'd try to be less bothered by CR comments, even the most nitpicky things *so long as they are making the code better*. \n\nBut ours is also a world of automation. There are technical solutions to make things faster and more objective. I'd suggest If it's simple things that a linter could catch, then perhaps suggest modifying your team's linters to catch that issue. This will make everything more accurate, tighten up CR schedules and whatnot. If these are not things a linter could catch, are they things that can be defined in a coding standard? Is that coding standard documented? If not, you could be the person who writes it down. Are these issues that can be caught in a dryrun? If so, look into your packages' build targets and CRUX rules so that the necessary dryruns run the necessary checks.\n\nThe other question is to make sure we have a meeting of the minds on the question of design and what each task is actually implementing. Insist on better tickets as input and ask for clarification on requirements early if you're confused. *This is a perfectly valid way to push back earlier in the dev cycle*. \n\nNow, if these things are being seen as a sign of poor performance and not an opportunity for you to develop as an engineer, than yeah... This might just be an issue with your team. Or perhaps even your org as a whole. On my team, I'm being measured on the number of revisions each CR takes, and yeah, I'm being driven a bit nuts by that because it destroys a big chunk of the utility of the CR tool to solicit feedback.\n\nThis is both on you and on your team/org. You have to accept that receiving feedback, even critical feedback, is part of the job. They have to provide that feedback professionally and keep it focused on delivering a better final result rather than stoking someone's ego or gaming CR metrics. Sadly, you can't do all that much about someone in the org thinking that the number of code review revisions says how productive an engineer is and there's only so much you can do about someone who treats the review process as an excuse to go on an ego trip. But you can control how you act. You can ask questions to deepen your understanding of the technical issues at play, you can be the change you want to see on the team when you're the one writing technical comments about other's code or designs, you can seek process improvement about how your deliver code changes.",

You either accept that you have things to learn and do it, and/or you accept that they suck and ignore them.\n\nI'm pretty thorough, and even still, pretty much every PR gets at least a couple nits; that's kind of the whole point.

Confidence has to be internal, or it's very brittle.

Learn from the rest in what's required to enhance your product with a maintainable pattern.\n\nFor your next PR, take a walk and then pre-review it before publishing.  Look for anything worth commenting on in that's familiar from other comments you've received, and fix-up before pushing.  Sometimes when a change is a slog we get stuck in \"just trying to finish\" and it ends up taking more iterations than if we step back and give the code a good massage before pushing it.\n\nBonus option: Tally using reviewer initials and take stock in who's leaving you the best comments -- hit them up and thank them! Being taken seriously when I'm reviewing code for others makes me more willing to jump in on other comment threads for them.",

Write some design docs and work independently on a few projects that last for more than a quarter that meaningfully land and you've basically hit all the requirements. You could get delayed by six months because of budget stuff but in general it's not bad. Promotions to L5 and especially L6+ have become *way* messier in the past two years. Strict budgets and a requirement for \"business need\" means that a lot of qualified people are being rejected for these promos, creating a glut in the next cycle and ultimately stalling a lot of careers. One piece of good news is that you can stay at L4 forever at Google without a problem, so getting over this hurdle isn't mandatory.\n\nA lot of managers at Google were originally engineers first. Usually the path is getting promoted to L5 or L6 first, demonstrating effective leadership and communication skills, and then having a nearby opening for a manager position that you can fill. In the past this used to be easier because headcount growth meant that \"we need a new manager to deal with the five new people we are hiring\" was pretty common. Now the most likely path is that a nearby manager quits and you are available to replace them.\n\nThis could conceivably change in the future, but from the inside the cultural change at Google feels permanent (at least while Sundar is CEO). \n\n10 years of experience and getting a L3 offer seems odd. I'd expect 10YOE to get interviewed for L5 and potentially downleveled to L4, but it sounds like maybe you were interviewed at L4 and did so-so on the interviews so you got downleveled to L3.",

Generally I’m almost always against mode leveling (especially senior to non-senior or staff to senior) because it’s so hard to make it up.\n\nHowever, I think in this case if you can make up the money difference, your current company isn’t high prestige, job stability isn’t great there etc, It might be worth at least considering though it sounds like they’re trying to drop you two levels rather than one. Sounds a bit crazy to me but then again Google is barely interviewing or hiring so if you get an offer these days it’s so rare it may be difficult to pass up.\n\nSpecifically to your question:\nThe L3 level is really entry level or a couple years at a small company. Again, I’m really surprised that’s what they’re offering but I guess it’s due to low hiring. As a result, the expectation to make it to L4 is there and it can be done fairly fast. Essentially L3 separated the new employees who are really struggling and need supervision from folks that can get a task that could take a couple months within a larger project, plan and document, launch it. Etc. it’s about independence. Doubt you’d have a problem there\n\nL4 to L5 (senior) is much more tricky due to needing the right project, having leadership, quotas, etc, but I’ve seen it done in as low as 2-3 years from L3. As long as you show you can lead a project managers will give you a chance as soon as they can. These promotions are in org so if leadership perceives you as a lead that got downleveled you’d get more opportunities\n\nFeel free to PM if you have questions",

The roles are inherently different.\n\nI don't know anything about Google's internal processes so can't comment on that, but if your career goal is to be a manager, changing from a manager role down to a SWE role is not going to be beneficial, and if anything it'll look bad on your resume. Sure Google has massive hiring prestige, but they hired you as a SWE, not a manager. Who knows how long it'll take before Google puts you into a management role. Who knows if they'll *ever* put you into a management role.\n\nIf being a manager is your goal, I would continue looking until I found a manager role.\n\nJust like if being a SWE was my goal, and a company offered me an IT position, I would keep looking until I found a SWE role.",

I can quite easily get away with putting in 5-10 hours per week and no one bats an eye.\n\nThat being said, there is still value in FAANG.. it pays higher, is more prestigious and can open up more doors for you.\n\nI can almost guarantee I will be more stressed and way less happy at FAANG than my current company, but despite that, I am still aiming for it soon... just so I can cross it off my list and I don't regret it later on when I'm 80 or something lol. Of course it's not as easy as saying \"I want to join FAANG\", tons of preparation and luck involved too.. but I'm gonna keep trying until I hopefully get it.\n\nI think at the end of the day, there is no right or wrong.

My main role was that I built the installation for a really complex app. You know, the Next >, Next >, Next > app you use when you install something on Windows? That was me. \n\nIn 2011 a FAANG company reached out to me and said they were going to be my town and asked if I wanted to interview. We were starting to hire at my company and I had no idea how to run a tech interview, so I said yes assuming I could steal their ideas. To my surprise, they offered me a job. \n\nIt was a mid level SDE position. In my role at my company I was a team lead, but the pay was so much more that I decided to take it and try to stay for 2 years. It involved a relocation I wasn't interested in, but again. Way more money. Well, I'm still here 13 years later. I've moved through the ranks well and now lead an organization. \n\nI've now interviewed for other companies and almost always get turned down or get offered a role way below my abilities or comp that isn't anywhere close.\n\nThe difference? I think largely luck. There's so many things that can go right or wrong in this silly process that we use. And unfortunately, right this instant, luck is not on your side. There are fewer jobs than there are new grads who want them. It'll likely turn around, but right now your best bet is to study hard, leet code, and get as many at bats as you can manage. Take interviews, big and small. Get better at it. Remember: You don't necessarily need to be a great engineer, you need to be a good interview. The venn diagram of those two things often overlap, but its certainly not 1 to 1.\n\nDive into your current job. You'll get good examples that you can use for the behavioral assessments. \n\nAlso: If you didn't get a return offer, what was the reason? Focus on that area as much as you can.",

My thought is, though, you can’t live your life in fear. What you can do is be realistic and accept that layoffs and other crap happen, and these days more than at many points in the past. So don’t be a financial idiot and over leverage yourself in ways you can avoid; for example don’t buy a luxury car when a frugal one will do or when you can do without. Might seem obvious but I’ve worked with a ton of guys who splurge on that next level Maserati when they’re not even that senior. And keep your eyes on the job market with a long view: look at specific roles you’d want to apply for if you lost your job today, and act like you’re getting ready to interview for them. Upskill as needed, get relevant certs if there are any that are respected and apply to your type of role, work on personal projects that would potentially impress that company.",

If you catch yourself worrying and thinking about some potential problem, take reasonable action to mitigate the risks, do what you can do, and stop worrying about it. Worrying that doesn't translate into productive action is a waste of effort, so don't do it.\n\nThe fact that you, yourself, say, your worry is irrational, means you know it's irrational, and just talk to yourself like an adult and tell yourself to stop worrying about irrational things. There will always be risks in life, and everyone has to live with that. Do what you can do to miitigate risks and enjoy the ride.\n\nI had a traumatic sudden layoff experience early in my career, and I've have always felt fear of layoffs.

Your friend could try applying to startups if he isn’t already to try and get close to that pay. \n\nThough I really think he should focus on getting a job and settling for less. He could probably get something for 200-250k and that’s still an eye watering amount of money. This should also be a lesson for him to save as much as he can going forward.",

Again, I can’t help you be more confident but I’ll give you one piece of advice. Ask yourself what you’re lacking in and become an expert or as close to that as you can. If you find yourself constantly asking domain specific questions, go become the domain expert. Become your own senior dev so you don’t have to go to anyone else and if you absolutely need help on something and they don’t give you clear information don’t be so prideful that you won’t ask for clarification.

It's so rare that an employee has the confidence to do that. Most people always just ghosted us if they didn't like the job. I respect his decision, and I wasn't mad at him. If he wanted another shot, I would've given it to him. \n\nMy manager was mad at him though. In the end, it didn't matter. He did what was best for him.",

I quit that and then picked up a Gas Station job at Speedway and worked there for 6 months. \n\nRemind you this is all while having a Computer Science degree with 4 internships under my belt. I applied to just above 450 or so jobs and would get from those around 12 call backs and only 1 offer. It was demoralizing. By some miracle a company only 5 minutes away from my home called me for an interview through a  recruiter and I ended up acquiring the job! I couldn’t be blessed enough. I am learning so much about the ASP.NET ecosystem . The major downside of this job whoever is the pay. I make around $57,000 in Michigan which is considered on the super low side of things. But I feel you in terms of wanting that pay raise and moving up : ( the ladder. I want to gain some more experience after a year or two and try to negotiate a pay raise but if my employer won’t budge then I will probably look around for another position that will pay me more. \n\nDon’t give up!",

Adjust accordingly based on the language you all start in. When you’re done with a base level book in whatever language your courses are in, get a good book on object oriented programming. Having a good knowledge foundation will make projects and your classes ten times easier. \n\nIf you want that CS internship then you need to be ready to stand out for your school’s career fair. Try doing a project that actually interests you. Maybe try your hand at doing some free work for some family and friends. Above all else it needs to be a tangible thing recruiters can use (Website, App, Twitter Bot, Game, or a physical arduino/raspberry pi project) \n\nMost of all, find something you find interesting outside of programming this summer that you can do at school to meet people. Not only will this help you get balance, but you’ll also meet people which can turn into a job. \n\nRock climbing tends to be pretty popular among us CS nerds because it’s basically the same as programming.

AI & CV are two things I wish Rust had a lil more of but that’s alright. \n\n I have NO idea if this is the best route for you but it’s working pretty well for me. You might want to learn another language which aligns with your interests more and just see if it’s fun. Now is the time to relax and explore 🙏",

But it's his right to try to make the best life possible for himself. \n\nGive your employer a proper two weeks notice. If there is some type of crunch or deadline, you can be open-minded about maybe giving them more time. I gave my last employer three weeks notice to help finish off what I was working on. It was a contract position. I don't think the client really cared at the end of the day. The contracting company claims they wanted to stay on good terms, but it might be just because I was staffable, and some of the people at the client liked me. \n\nYou don't have to tell a company where you are going to, but don't lie and say you're going to stop working. \n\nAlso, try not to check out during your notice period. Genuinely do knowledge transfer and make things easier for those who will take over your work. There are people who just coast and make things harder for people. It's up to you if you want to be open to them reaching out. I've helped previous employers, but it probably didn't do me much good in the long-term. Some people actually do consulting work for previous employers. \n\nRelationships and work relationships are really unpredictable. It can be hard to tell if something will be genuine or not, but maybe that's just me. \n\nDon't overthink leaving a job. Yeah, there are times you leaving will put a company in a tough spot, but most companies can work around that.

You roll in around 10 am and do standup. Work for an hour then lunch for an hour. You'll stand in line for 30 minutes at a food truck if you don't go before 12. At 1 you'll work for a few hours then go home. Maybe ping pong or something once a week if you have coworkers who are into that and you want to play. That's your day. Somewhere in there you'll go get your free coffee and a banana and think about working at a company that isn't so cheap.\n\nAs you get promoted, there are more and more meetings with every promotion and you get involved in all kinds of random email/slack threads but you're also expected to get as much coding done as the L4s.\n\nMost everything depends on your team and manager. Your manager has a very large role in your happiness and how horrible your deadlines are and your team will make it fun + help you... or they won't and you'll cry yourself to sleep because you can't figure anything out. Difficult to tell you if it will be good or not.\n\nYou should pick waymo tbh. Amazon's mandatory firing bucket and current layoff outlook has had a corrosive effect on the culture and if you have a good option, you should go there.",

When there are events outside of it, it's not some company wide curated event in disguise to make you work longer hours. I feel the barrier between office life and personal life is much more respected.\n\nThe other thing I like is the lax dress code. The previous company was very strict about dress code even on casual Fridays which just means you can wear jeans. I can wear anything as long as it's fine in public.\n\nWork isn't stressful and as mentally exhausting. Tech may not be the most cutting edge. As I get older, I prefer to work things that won't make me mentally exhausted when I get home. Things did heat up a bit during and after the pandemic, but still comparatively less stressful.\n\nWork in many different domains that can be transferable to even non tech jobs.\n\nJob security, S tier health benefits, and pension. Pay bit below market, but all things considered, it is fair. The pay can be found in the handbook. Everyone paid consistently by role plus experience.",

This passion and drive will make you a great engineer IF you can learn where to apply it. You can’t apply it everywhere, especially in a job, because your delivery speed will be slow.\n2. Accept the fact that software is iterative. As long as it meets the requirements, who says you can’t go back to it later and make it more robust once you have more information?\n3. It’s possible you’re ready to start specializing in a particular language/stack/domain to limit the scope of what you really need to know. Once you start seeing the same problems/structures over and over again in different contexts, you can get by with educated guesses about internals unless you really need to know how something works to solve a problem. This seems works across languages/stacks as well once you see enough.\n4. If you start to feel burnt out, take a break if you can and reset. Not worth going over the edge for “perfect” code.\n5. Remember that if you can learn one thing deeply, you can do it again whenever you need to. Research skills don’t disappear quickly.\n\nAt the end of the day, you will not have all the requirements up front, so all you can really do is just do it to the best of your ability while trying to account for immediately visible edge cases, see if it solves the problem, and optimize/fix bugs if needed and repeat.",

You can't run down every rabbit hole and still make your deadlines. \n\n\nExample: I had dabbled in web frontend for a bit. Understanding JS and react wasn't bad, but we used create-react-app and I decided when I was going to start a new project fresh I was going to do it by hand. A week later after being neck deep in babel and webpack and transpiling I just gave up and realized I bit off more than I could chew and just downloaded create-react-app and got moving. \n\n\nIt hurt early in my career because everything was so brand new and I wanted to master it all, but I had projects to do first. Nowadays even when I first saw something like k8s or react, for the most part I understand the context of what came before it and what it's trying to solve so I feel I already kind of understand it before even diving in. The exception here might be AI- I felt like I had a pretty good handle on it up to around 2018, then things seemed to move at light speed- reading some of the latest papers to come out of Anthropic is like reading a foreign language. \n\n\nThe key is to know when to dig a little deeper and when to let go. You can't read the full 1000 page manual before starting every time. BUT, if you eventually do read that manual or those docs from end to end you will leap ahead of your peers in time. ",

Junior engineers work on small tasks that only take a few days or weeks. Senior engineers work on large multi-month deliverables.\n\nComplexity has to do with how tricky the actual task is. I work in video streaming. A junior engineer might work on something like \"fix this tiny bug in the encoding module.\" A senior engineer might work on something like \"design and implement a scalable transcoding pipeline for <x> use case.\"\n\nAmbiguity has to do with how well-defined the task is. A junior engineer would work on something that's really obvious, clear, and requires very little clarification. A senior engineer might be given a vague problem statement like \"our video transcode pipeline is too slow. Go fix it.\" or \"We need <x> feature, figure it out.\", and the onus is on them to dissect that request into actionable, concrete technical tasks for the team to work on.\n\nThe more you focus on these three things, the better an engineer you become.\n\nRead [DropBox's technical career guide.](https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/ic1_software_engineer.html) It goes into even more detail than this, at all levels from junior to director.\n\nNote that *nothing* in the guide mentions *any* of the things in your post.

        "body": "The only secret to front end is being detail oriented and persistent. The engineers that I’ve worked with that were bad at front end were just in a rush or weren’t detail oriented. They often were the back end devs with the most issues in their PRs.\n\nThe bugs that come up in front-end are often unintuitive and caused by multiple small problems adding up. Take the obvious path to matching the design and write it. Then test it out, compare it to the design, find where it doesn’t match, open the dev tools panel, play around with the css inspector to figure out what’s going wrong, make more changes and repeat until it works as expected. Sometimes your design was the problem, sometimes the person before you cut corners so when you implement your changes correctly they break other things. Sometimes there’s some weird inheritance issue or a library you’re using is causing issues.\n\nPeople treat front end like it’s this easy thing and only back end is real work. But front end can be unforgiving, performance is far more of an issue than people think, and the amount of detail you need to pay attention to isn’t small.\n\nSo seriously just be persistent. If you aren’t good at CSS, it’s not a big topic, spend a week or two working through a course to understand it. After that it’s persistence. I have a terrible memory, I forget CSS properties and what they do all the time, but I’m still the one that gets assigned the weirdest bugs because I don’t let the weirdness get to me, I keep at it until I find the root cause and then look up whatever I need to know.",

From doing these kinds of interviews from a BE perspective you should do the following \n\n1) before you put pen to paper , ask plenty of clarifying questions. Who's gonna be using the application? What scale and why? Etc ask the interviewers directly what the functional requirements are. Or if they say it's up to you then make a few assumptions about some single functionality. Eg if it's a car management website you'll need some functionality to add a car, search for a specific type car, iew a list of cars, click on a single car etc. also discuss non functional requirements like availability, maintainability, readability etc. and how these could lead trade offs. Get as much information as possible before writing anything. \n\n2) if it's based on OOP they'll be looking you to map out all of your main objects, their properties and their relationships. Eg customer, car. I'm just doing the cuff so there will be others. They'll be looking for good practice when it comes to designing the application like using N-tier / layered architecture and understanding of what each layer should do. Eg model, controller, service, data layer etc. why this is good for maintainability and isolating each component for testing. \n\nHopefully this helps",

Can we network? I'm looking for work!\" emails. You're trying to skirt the process. The process is there *for a reason*.

You need to go through HR like everybody else. If HR doesn't think you're worth showing to the hiring manager, *then that's the process working as intended.* That's why we pay them.\n\nSome people claim they've had success cold messaging, and I'm sure anecdotally it may have worked out for them a handful of times. But it's mostly frowned upon. Why would the fact you cold-emailed me make you a better candidate than someone that followed the very clear instructions we posted about applying online so you go through the system?\n\nAll that said, it's not like there's much to lose besides your time if you really want to send out cold-email blasts. Just understand it will annoy most people. But maybe there's a few gems out there at small companies that will think it shows moxie and they'll give you a chance.",

The manager still has to do their regular job, hiring people is a side-task for them.\n\nIt doesn’t seem like most HR departments are actually doing their jobs of looking through the resumes. Most resumes will never even be looked at by a human, and that’s why people will contact recruiters or hiring managers! They want the human contact and attention in an incredibly competitive market, and it is quite literally their job to interact with candidates. It’s clear though most of them can’t even do their job properly when they constantly ghost candidates and people they even reach out to anyway\n\nYou know what’s actually annoying? People who contact random strangers for referrals. At least recruiters and hiring managers are meant to contact these candidates. If said candidate actually writes an interesting email to these people instead of something generic, there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with that. Just solely applying on the career website without any action might not cut it anymore\n\n>But it's mostly frowned upon\n\nClearly it isn’t if it’s being encouraged by people here and the “Cracking the coding interview” guys. If you don’t like it, fine. But what in the world do you expect all these desperate new grads to do? The hiring process is simply garbage\n\nDon’t hate the player, hate the game?",

It's like you said. Applicants (read: desperate new grads). Of course *they're* saying to give it a shot.\n\nTry asking an actual hiring manager if they enjoy getting hundreds / thousands of unsolicited emails.\n\nThe only possible time a HM is going to say it's not a problem is when the scale is low enough it's not taking up any meaningful amount of their time. Like 1 or 2 emails.\n\nBut if people start taking your advice, that number would sky rocket to literally thousands. They simply don't have the time to sift through a bunch of desperate emails. I get that you don't like that fact, and that you're saying hiring is broken, but it is what it is.\n\nBut like I said, don't let what I'm saying deter you from trying it yourself. You asked how hiring managers perceive cold emails, I'm letting you know that *in general*, it's not appreciated from the hiring manager side. There's of course exceptions, and if you want to spray & pray go for it. It doesn't matter if you annoy 1000 hiring managers if 1 of them liked the email and gives you a job, right? You do you.",

This is tough because a lot of the time it will be the staff or principal level people who seem rude on the surface. In my experience the most technical people will help you the most, but you can't ask them general questions because they're so used to getting bombed with general questions from non-technical people.",

You’ll definitely learn more than this as you move along your career but from my personal mistakes I’d say:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- You will eventually run into some legacy code that looks horrendous at first. Don’t trash it loudly around the team thinking they will agree and think you’re smart for identifying bad code. You may be missing context on the implementation and possibly be shit talking your colleagues ideas on solving a problem you don’t fully know about. \n\n\n\n- give yourself an hour or two on trying to figure something out yourself before you ask more senior devs on your team for help\n\n\n\n- KWYDK (Know What You Don’t Know) when something you don’t know about comes up in a meeting or discussion, note it down to figure out later or ask colleagues. Tackling complex problems becomes easier when you list out specifics that have you confused.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Don’t get too comfortable, everyone is replaceable. Keep your resume up to date and refresh skills when you have down time. \n\n\n\n\n- Most people only value in-depth details/explanations in a one on one setting. Discussions with multiple people should be kept as simple as possible. People don’t remember the dev who bored them with endless details on the code constraints that are causing so and so overhead, they remember the dev who broke down the problem into short bullets and had an idea on the next steps in minutes instead of hours.\n\n\n\n\n- take a look at some recent PRs or commits your colleagues have made. Observing the changes will help you understand the codebase and what the coding standards might be (ex; some teams are do or die about code readability versus some teams are all about performance)\n\n\n\n\n- Keep tabs on how you perform versus the rest of the team. If you notice on average devs on the team are getting multiple features knocked out in the time it takes you to do one, you’ll know you gotta improve. Better to notice the performance gaps yourself before your manager can.\n\n\n\n- Maintain a good rep with your colleagues and try to be likable. At every job so far, I’ve seen okay devs that are easy to be around go much further in their careers, than the knowledgable 10x dev who is a pain to talk to.",

We work for them to further our own life goals. Better hours, better pay, more involvement and personal satisfaction? That's a fat W (and now you're not staring down the barrel of being let go for under performance).",
