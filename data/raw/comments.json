Even for experienced folks, there are lots more laid-off people looking for jobs in this market so it's just more competitive. Entry-level is fucked beyond belief.\n\n>Why are companies acting like jerks?\n\nThey can afford to be more picky. Sometimes, it does seem quite ridiculous though and I do feel that many employers actually have unreasonable expectations and are so hostile/skeptical of others' work experience that they want perfection.",

I recently joined a new company and I'm absolutely blown away by the use of delivery teams, lack of anyone doing real work outside the data engineer and dashboard critiques from end users. Then they wonder why they can't find someone or when they do ends up telling them \"I haven't done that before\" and throws off the quarters goals, which is unacceptable. No idea how to deal with it but I really think they're just using the shit job market to expand our responsibilities to save money in the short term. In 5 years when the data no longer makes sense and they need to find another excuse for a redesign we will see the find out part of fuck around and find out.",

But you can be displaced by the perception that one is “good enough.”\n\nI think the arguments on both sides of the LLM table are misplaced.\n\nEvery conversation online about AI replacing humans is centered around looking at it from an individualistic perspective. But that’s not how labor works in the workplace.\n\nEssentially, both of the below statements can be true:\n\n- AI can’t be a drop-in replacement for Data Engineering\n- I, as a Data Engineer, can be replaced with AI.\n\n\n\nIf a company begins using LLMs to perform tasks that are repetitive/boilerplate/specific to the strengths of the LLM, and that work makes up a X% of the labor of their data engineering department, allowing for more time from each individual data engineer to perform more work suited for the human DE, then justification for keeping ALL of the original labor isn’t there - assuming the same amount of work is being done.\n\nWhen looking at this from the macroeconomic scale, yes the usage of LLMs to increase productivity in the workplace - whether by agentic automation or simply by using it as a quicker and more efficient task-oriented search engine, WILL have an effect on the number of jobs available in DE and very well could lead to YOU being replaced by an AI, while not replacing all DEs.\n\nAt any rate, I generally agree with your points on side-stepping being labeled for replacement by embracing and becoming the expert in the business with LLMs usage. It’s what I’ve done and led to me being promoted and now sitting in a much higher position within the company I work for.",

You don’t want to make sure your 300 billions records are unique every time you add a new row.\n\nBut the concept of unique identifier should be introduced into almost all tables. That unique identifier is normally a surrogate key. Surrogate key are unique identifier derives from other fields. For example a md5 hash of the concatenation of 4 columns. This give you a unique identifier.\n\nWhat’s great about surrogate keys is that they are not random. You get consistency in any systems, if you migrate to another platform your surrogate keys are still valid and that’s very powerful. \n\nAlso you can reproduce the same results over and over again, which is not possible if you use a UUID generated by another system for example.\n\nThen depending on the tool you use you can validate the uniqueness of the fields yourself. \n\nThere’s some reason you might want to do this yourself and not the system like you would have in a normal db and is that because you can have multiple time the same records or a different version of what you consider the same records.\n\nSince the DW is for analytics you might want to analyze those different records which are not unique in your raw layer but could be in your marts.\n\nSo it’s a powerful thing to let you control de uniqueness of the fields yourself.\n\nObviously if you don’t manage it you’ll probably end up with a lot of duplicates. But since the DW store all your data it’s better to avoid having the constraint on inserts and give the users more flexibility. Because he might need all version for what he is trying to achieve.\n\nTLDR; yep a surrogate key should be something you have in all tables (when possible)",

You are getting confused by marketing terms and, unfortunately, that is by design. \n\nI think you can spot me what a database is. That's pretty straight forward. A data warehouse is just a very, very large database. There are two different database areas, operational and analytic. They are characterised by the SLAs you have on the data. Smaller databases are normally used for operational because you need fast response times. In analytic, the response times aren't normally as critical but they handle quite a bit more data; much of it historic. In a perfect world, if you could do both with the same system, you would. The problem is the cost to do them all in one. Of course, these are gross oversimplifications but it gets the idea across. In addition to the database component, the surrounding data ecosystems are different but they have many commonalities.\n\nData Lake and Lakehouse are both marketing BS. Nothing more. The same is true of \"medalion architecture.\" It is an attemp to make the standard three tier (staging, core, semantic) into to something different by giving it a new coat of paint. Someone noticed that you can store quite a bit of extra \"stuff\" in the staging layer beyond what the database needs. Of course, the marketing folks thought that needed a new name. I think we are at the point now where we just keep adding buzzwords to the names. It's like a technical pin the tail on the donkey. The latest is \"now with more AI!.\" \n\nA data ecosystem is a complicated enough of an endeavor without all the confusion that is being pushed on it purposefully. I haven't even started in on Inmon, Kimball, Stars, Snowflakes, the various normal forms, ETL/ELT, etc. Good luck on your journey.",

Especially when you work with things that are closer to ML, that have testable behaviours that only manifest when working on a huge dataset with specific patterns. This is not an intractable problem, though. You still can factor your code correctly and cover with unit tests as much as you can, and write queries for ongoing data quality monitoring (a good data analyst will be a very important ally in this activity). For more complex stuff, talk to your platform/infra/governance people about having a \"sandbox\" environment - prod data but all the sensitive parts masked. \n\nNobody understands the complexity? That sounds like your org needs more \"less technical\" people like analysts, not less. And yes, you as a DE need to be in touch with them, because they will be able to tell you what to expect of your data.\n\nPeople questioning numbers when they don't match vibes? Honestly that sounds like something a data product manager/owner has to tackle. As an engineer, all you can do is deliver data quality assurance, and point to that. After this it's with the PM/PO to sell the value of the team's work.\n\nVersion control issues? Yes, that happens when an org has a lot of DAs/DSs with more science/business background. I think the will to do git appears after one or two incidents when someone does a breaking change that nobody had a chance to review, or accidentally deletes some script on some server somewhere. If your data team is subsidary to technical leaders in the org chart, I think they're usually sympathetic to the idea, and you can go through them to push git adoption. You can also smooth things along by writing a \"git for dummies\" document for your DS/DA. No need to deep dive into advanced features, just teaching them commit/push/pull and merge requests should be enough. Do make sure your main is protected in all your repos, though.\n\nStuff outside of your control, but you have to fix it? That exists, yes, but I don't think that's unique to DE. Don't backend devs in microservice-oriented companies deal with the same problem?",

Spent a year there until a big reorganization occurred. We moved to the cloud, data science became its own thing, a data engineering team got stood up. I initially moved with data science, but it was clear my skills did not mesh well except for the data engineering, but they wanted to move all DE work over to the DE team eventually. I took that opportunity after just over a year in that position. \n\nOn day 1 with the DE team, we were building stop gap solutions. I spent that time getting really good with pyspark. I already had a large background with pandas, so pyspark was very easy to figure out. From there, we had consultants build our long term data platform while the full timers worked on ad hoc requests to keep the business moving and start making a name for our team. During this time, I learned I was really good at programming business logic and transformations. I was not nearly as good at ingestion or tools outside of databricks. \n\nEventually our SAAS integration started, and I was working directly with consultants. I was well out of my depth, but I learned the process pretty quickly, patched some early holes in my technical knowledge, and got rolling. \n\nI learned that I was really good at functional programming, but pretty bad at DevOps and way out of my league in OOP. \n\nNow, I'm working on a project to rebuild our data platform to one easier to maintain, more flexible, and moves data faster. I'm focusing more on architecture, but making sure that these new consultants are training my team and me every step of the way. My manager assigned me as lead for this project. \n\nMy manager wants me to train to become an engineering architect. Whereas I'm a decent engineer with a lot of potential to grow there, I am kinda a natural on all things architectural. So that is how I'm leaning now.",

He advocates making decisions when you have about 70% of the information you wish you had\n\nOk, and how much is that, exactly? A lot of decisions don't have a massive checklist of \"all the things I need to know\" that, when you get to 70% acts as a threshold triggering the decision. A lot of decisions rely on knowledge and experience and attempting to quantify that at all ends up falling into the same trap that dashboards do: Qualitative judgements are only loosely connected to quantitative amounts.\n\nI don't doubt Jeff Bezos knows what he's doing up to a point but I have my doubts his actual working practice bears much resemblance to the principle he's expressing here.

Numbers need to be put in context and fit into some kind of overarching narrative before it clicks. The great writers of Substack already understand this. Think Scott Alexander, Noah Smith, Nate Silver. Or go read Wolf Street. MUCH more intuitive than any business dashboard I've ever looked at.\n\nBut the flip side of that is: when are dashboards appropriate? Should all analysis just be ad-hoc and narrative-driven? My intuition is that you should curate a very small, simple set of business-wide KPIs and put them on an internal website and have them update reliably a few times a day. For anything more strategic or involved, where there is a key decision to be made, you need analysts to put on the researcher hat and go do the analysis (hopefully with a nice clean data model that the DEs have set up). You need them to be opinionated. Dashboards aren't opinionated, they just tell you what happened without any further guidance.",

As with all dev work there's a fair amount of \"it depends\" to be had in any situation, but I can't see where this level of normalization would ever be useful inside a data warehouse.\n\nI think people pursuing this behavior have lost sight of the \"why.\" The Star Schema model was originally created during an age with storage was the scarce resource so it was important never to store duplicate data. Nowadays, storage is so cheap it's practically free so it's compute that we must optimize for. Having to do dozens of `join`s to gain context on every record certainly doesn't support that. \n\nUsually, I practice some form of what you might call \"Star Schema Light\" in the silver layer where I create tables around business entities. So all the 'user' dimensions would be in one table (and it would probably have a companion SCD table), all the 'session' dimensions in another etc. Then these can be  `join`d and de-normalized in gold to expose to BI tools as needed while analysts can still have some flexibility by using the silver tables. \n\nHaving said all that, be careful. Myself and two colleagues were recently fired for suggesting this very thing and pointing out we shouldn't administer Snowflake like one would on-prem Oracle.",

That's how transactional databases are supposed to be. A star schema is a denormalized schema (it breaks the rules of normalization, 3NF).\n\nYour use case doesn't look very \"star schema\" to me as many to many relationships should be rare. Another way to reword this is that the UserTag entity is a fact table. You could add a date / calendar dimension to this fact and this would allow you to see how many users one tag have, which users have which tags... It also depends on how \"fast\" these tags are attributed. Could they be considered an attribute to the fact? It is hard to decide without having a closer look at your use case and the data.\n\nRegarding the surrogate keys. You don't need them on all dimensions. You need them on SCD2 dimensions, and not all dimensions need to be SCD2. You also need SK when combining data from different sources into one single dimension, and they don't have a common key.\n\nRegarding the project... 20 people working on one single star schema, 2 years. That's insane. Do you work in insurance? It sounds like something massively overengineered which goes against the premises of dimensional modeling: easy to query.",

But if it's the norm, then it's probably time to move on and parlay the recognizable name into a better role.\n\nYou can definitely find consulting companies that take quality of work more seriously. I don't know how to vet them besides just talking to people in similar roles. When you do, ask about the sales process, the role of vendor partnerships (this can almost singlehandedly determine your technical focus!), how they go about scoping, how satisfied clients generally seem, etc. If you get engineers to answer those questions, that will shed a lot of light on the kind of environment you might be stepping into (which is tightly linked to the kinds of clients your sales and marketing people are able to reach).\n\n(Edited to add: If those discussions make it sound like that firm is bent on pitching solely AI everything these days...huge red flag. Obviously I'm speaking from my own biases here, but IMHO it's a recipe for perpetual scope change at best, and completely unrealistic expectations at worst. Too many un-serious people selling to other un-serious people who are spending still other un-serious people's money for no clear reason. Naturally, YMMV.)\n\nBy way of background, my data career has been solely in consulting. It's been about 10 years at a couple of relatively small firms (in the 100–200-person range) so I don't know what things are like at much larger ones. I have worked in-house before but in a very a different field. Overall, I'm satisfied with my career path, but it has its drawbacks, especially if technical learning is your *top* priority.\n\nThere have been long periods where my technical skills stagnated. Once I've reached a certain degree of experience with our bread-and-butter projects, most of the work is on the business logic and requirements side, not the technical side, since I've probably done it a dozen times before.\n\nObviously I'm always keeping up with developments from vendors we typically use (and what's new from others to some extent)...but it's not like I'm frequently taking on entirely new kinds of projects. That's not a bad thing in my book! All those less- or non-technical skills are extremely important. What's more, even if selling the same solution repeatedly isn't the most technically exciting, it's one way to keep increasing your effective hourly rate.\n\nGranted, my favorite clients have been smaller ones (like a few hundred staff members or less) who need all kinds of random data things solved. Sometimes that does require unfamiliar technologies, which are often equal parts fun and frustrating at the same time. But those more open-ended projects, where I'm sort of the \"data guy\" on call, are inherently less specialized, and often less lucrative as a result.",

        "body": "Hi Guys, Snowflake employee here & just wanted chime in with a bit more info on this topic so you guys are clear what the new feature is and what it is not.\n\nPreviously, we had 2 main methods for Spark users to interact with or leverage Snowflake vectorized engine.\n\n1. Snowpark Dataframes: These were close to PySpark APIs but (not exact).  Initially (2,3 years ago) they were limited in coverage but as of now, do cover most of PySpark functions so if you tried it before, experience is much different now. Because Snowpark was not exactly as PySpark, it did require about 10% code refactoring so some migration effort was necessary. Benefit of Snowpark dataframes was that they were not held back by OSS PySpark Functions so you had access to Snowflake specific ML & AI functions and the newest features. Snowpark Dataframes allowed you to leverage 100% Snowflake Serverless Compute engines for SQL, Python, Java & Scala UDFs.\n2. Snowflake Spark Connector: This was meant to connect existing Spark clusters to Snowflake to read, transform & write data to/from Snowflake. Driver has some optimization where some of the aggr functions could be performed in Snowflake before delivering the data to Spark cluster but the Spark Compute Clusters did bulk of the work where Snowflake was input and/or output for the data.\n\nThe new Apache Spark Connect from Snowpark combines best of both worlds Apache Spark code that developers love & use for Data Engineering & ML and Snowpark which gives access to serverless vectorized engine for SQL, Python, java & Scala jobs.\n\nRecent innovation from Spark Connect from OSS Spark community was the catalyst that Snowflake was waiting for to integrate OSS Spark in to Snowflake ecosystem the right way.\n\nThis means you can now run your existing Spark jobs with 0 code changes on Snowflake compute which comes with many added benefits such as unified security & governance, performance, auditability & simplicity as compute is serverless and requires little to no optimization or maintenance.\n\nHow it works is that the OSS Spark sends the job details to Snowflake, Snowflake generates a new execution plan based on the original details that can run on Snowflake Vectorized Engine (SQL, Python UDFs & etc.) sot he original code remains the same but where & how it executes in back are different.\n\nOur initial focus for Public Preview was majority of the customer use cases that we have seen which are Data Engineering & ML workloads that use SQL, Dataframes & UDFs. We are actively working on collecting feedback and build  support for other new Spark features supported by the OSS Spark Connect project so definitely would love any feedback that you guys have to take to our PMs.\n\nI understand this may not be the right fit for every Spark team. If your team enjoys tweaking Spark params & cluster configs to get every ounce of performance out of clusters then this solution may not be a good fit. However, if the team enjoys Spark code and has a ton of existing pipelines but would rather spend their time building & deploying new projects vs. optimizing & maintaining cluster, it will be a great benefit. Especially if Snowflake is the downstream analytics layer as it would eliminate any Export & Import jobs(time & cost) between Spark & Snowflake environments. \n\nThe main goal is to meet developers where they are by offering ways for them to leverage advances Snowflake capabilities by offering them different means to work with Snowflake in their preferred language and coding frameworks.\n\nIf you guys give it a try and have inputs don't hesitate the reach out and let us know feedback.The good, bad & the ugly.",

System go down? Restart it. Job not finish? Restart the system. Idempotency is a powerful concept that will make your life so much easier in the long run but without the ability to refresh the entire unit of work it becomes difficult to reason about. ",

Are you going to write a new pipeline to do that, or edit the existing one and re-run on the same input data?\n\nAnother example I didn't see mentioned is data size. Your pipeline might be written such that it extracts a delta of changes in the input db table and writes them to the output. This is because just copying the whole table every day is too expensive, and the changes are expected to be small, so could instead use a smaller machine. Now what do you do if the processing logic changes?\n\nOf course there are solutions to write a pipeline such that it handles both entire data and deltas, but those solutions always depend on the specifics of the input. It's often much easier (faster) to have a 2nd pipeline for full reloads, configured for a bigger machine, etc.",

I know the answers to this test are nowhere on line.  I ran a few of these by others in the dept. and they were able to do them in ~30-60 minutes.  I didn't think that was entirely onerous.  It was VERY clear that what was being generated was essentially random and wasn't trying to get free work, just seeing if people had the chops to do what they claimed in the interview.\n\nI suppose someone could feed the whole thing to a GPT model and ask it the questions, but...that's just a hazard these days I suppose.\n\nI agree that people trying to have candidates do full-on business case + pipeline design for free are overreaching and I would never ask that of a candidate.\n\nThere's a lot of the 'fuck you pay me' attitude and that's not wrong per se, but speaking from the hiring side, if you get asked to do a 45 minute task to show you can do it and you reply with 'fuck off', well...that's a choice you can make.  It will probably result in your not getting the position.",

But it works more or less the same as those hackthon coding test, it is also easy to cheat, even the question is a well crafted one, as long as the candidate has a very close friend who is a good developer. (Yes we do see cheating in this kind of coding test, basically, the hundsband help the wife). But for hiring a senoir or even intermediate dev, this is ridiculous. All employed seniors have tons of work to do,  no one will spend more than 4 hours on this kind of test, especially, there will be hours of interveiw coming up potentially. Also we will be careful to not helping the hiring company solving their problem. Thus it is more difficult for us to finish an assignment (I assume you will give serious difficult take home assignment in this scenario) without helping the hiring company to solve their problem. I would say, if you are a junior dev, take it, learn the new knowledge, if you are a intermediate to senior dev, just pass by, don't spend time on it. Meaningless, the one who review you result might be even less experience than you and give a false judgement and decide to not move forward with you.",

        "body": "Fantastic question! I literally just spent the past \\~6 months spinning something like this up from scratch for my company, except I wasn't blessed with a $50k/yr budget on tools. More like $5k/year tops. Here was my approach:\n\n* Sources: AWS Aurora Postgres database, various APIs, potentially Netsuite down the road\n* Destination: Timescale (now TigerData) database hosted using Timescale Cloud but linked to our VPC via VPC peering -- **this is where the bulk of our budget is going**.\n* Tech stack:\n   * Pulumi TypeScript to build infrastructure in AWS to support the open source version of the orchestrator, mostly using ECS Fargate for the containers and leveraging existing networking infrastructure\n   * Dagster OSS as the orchestration (went back and forth between this and Prefect before landing on Dagster)\n   * Sling as the core extract and load software to sync data from Postgres to Timescale\n   * dbt core running within the Dagster framework to apply transformations on new data in Timescale\n   * Python scripts orchestrated by Dagster to get data from APIs. Originally wanted to try dltHub but ended up just writing my own scripts using requests (probably not ideal)\n   * Monitoring/notifications via Slack app integration (originally was using [ntfy.sh](http://ntfy.sh) for quick and dirty SNS topic-like notifications, getting Slack approval was challenging)\n   * Dockerized local development using the pre-built Timescale and Postgres Docker images + the same custom Dockerfile I use for Dagster production deployments to keep things as simple as possible.\n\nData is synced from Postgres every 4 hours and daily for the APIs as that's essentially all that's required by our business. The Postgres sync with Sling runs incrementally and is complete in about 20 minutes, which is not optimized by any means but is sufficient for our purposes. For context, our entire source database was only about 330GB and I wasn't replicating the entire thing.\n\nWriting YAML for Sling and later for dbt was a huge time slog for 100+ source tables; I leveraged an AI tool (Claude) to help generate a lot of that code after manually building some of the transformation models myself. Bonus to this is it was the generated YAML was pretty consistent for common columns like `created_at` or `_sling_loaded_at` audit columns.\n\nI am the lone developer and maintainer of this project -- most people on my team are unaware that I'm even working on a project like this, let alone what its purpose might be. It has been a wild and frustrating ride at times without many others to turn to for help, but it's been a great learning experience as well. Throughout the development, I tried to stress simplicity, modularity, and ease of maintenance as much as possible. Once a larger team becomes available to support something like this, you can make different decisions like moving your data replication tasks to something like Fivetran or using a real data warehouse like Snowflake (again, budget constraints for us).\n\n~~Best of luck to you!~~ Edit: I reread the question and realized this is hypothetical but best of luck if this is ever you in the future all the same! Also I feel like my stack is pretty interchangeable with SQL Server as the source, just use different connectors with Sling (I believe SQL Server is supported).",

A lot of words and lines of code seem to get spent on the real basics like just counting nulls, empty strings, or zeros across all columns - but for my org, that would be totally wasted effort.

I don't want to spend CPU cycles testing MS SQL Server features that have been in place for decades.\n\nIf you don't mean that kind of dupe, then that starts a valuable but lengthy discussion about what we DO mean by a duplicate; the answer for us varies by table/entity, and is generally too complex for any off-the-shelf tool to handle (that I've seen).\n\nSo in short, for us the only business value is in a much more manual DQ process (manually defining what DQ means, not manually checking it!).

        "body": "If we’re talking about the future of data engineering, it’s worth first asking: *why does it exist at all?*\n\nOriginally, businesses needed someone to get them data for decision-making. First came BI developers/ETL engineers, they built warehouses and reports so analysts could do their work. Later, data analysts became more self-serve and focused on interpreting the past. Then data science took off, using that historical data to predict the future.\n\nBoth analysts and scientists quickly ran into the same problem: clean, reliable, well-structured data was hard to come by. That’s when the modern data engineer role emerged, not just to build infra, but to make data usable at scale.\n\nEarly DE work was infra-heavy, but as platforms matured (Databricks, GCP, Azure, Snowflake), more of the plumbing became automated. That doesn’t mean the job is going away, it means the focus shifts. You spend less time reinventing connectors and clusters, more time on things like modeling, scalability, governance, security, cost optimization, and integrating multiple data sources into a coherent system.\n\nThis is also where analytics engineers come in, they work closer to the business, doing a lot of SQL/dbt modeling and BI integration. In small teams, AEs might cover most data needs; in bigger orgs, DEs still handle the scale, complexity, streaming, and compliance side.\n\nIf anything, the “easy” DE tasks are disappearing, which makes deep skills more valuable:\n\n* Real-time pipelines (Kafka, Pub/Sub, Flink)\n* Data contracts, governance, compliance\n* Multi-cloud / cross-platform integration\n* ML data pipelines & feature stores\n* Performance and cost tuning at scale\n\nI wouldn’t say DE is shrinking, it’s just changing shape. The safest way to future-proof yourself is to stay close to both the business context *and* the technical challenges. Platforms will keep automating, but stitching them together, governing them, and making them serve the business well? That’s still human work.",

With no data engineers and a single analyst, there is limited investment in the data function (based on the provided information). Given the connector choice, maybe you report to finance? Regardless, it's one thing to get the data from point A to point B, it's another to ensure the data is correct. For example, what happens if they change the configuration of Salesforce objects? How will you handle that downstream?\n\nI say the above to warn of the trap of the business thinking that increased access to data easily results in more data utilization.",

They would all struggle hard if they jumped into where you are now, because they mostly just write scripts and things to get their analytical work done - they are not engineers. Engineering is quite a different mindset, I'm also a career switcher but I came from aerospace engineering so the mindset shift wasn't as big.\n\nThe best advice I can give you to read 'The Missing README A Guide for the New Software Engineer' by Chris Riccomini and Dmitriy Ryaboy. I think it would be very helpful for where you find yourself now and it a pretty short read.",

You can “ask” them things like, “why did this job fail?” and they’ll trace logs and give a quick readout.\n\nBut yeah—data access and vendor lock-in are real concerns. What helps:\n\n* Keep critical logic in your pipeline code, not in the agent\n* Let the agent suggest, but not act unless a human approves\n* Keep agent inputs small (e.g., just metadata or logs, not full datasets)\n\nCurious what tooling you’re testing?",

Not sure how big the team is but it sounds like a lot of stuff to glue together and maintain.\n\nI have quite a bit of experience working with multi-tenant data architecture, and almost always they benefitted significantly from shared larger data warehouses rather than per-customer instance, so I suggest centralizing. Down the line some new usecases will require cross-client insights, some new developments will benefit all the customers at once, and you'll thank yourself.\n\nIn terms of the architecture, it sounds like SQL-only stuff might not fit the bill here. I would suggest:\n- land the data in your dwh somehow\n- run transformations in SQL as much as possible, go with python where needed.\n- stay off of Spark, I don't see any benefit here for you, it is a complicated piece of software that is not even modern at this point.\n\nFor individual pieces, you can either go bit by bit, e.g. one tool for ingestion, another for transformation, orchestration, etc. There are quite a lot of good alternatives, e.g. Fivetran + dbt + airflow. I suggest taking a look at [ingestr](https://github.com/bruin-data/ingestr) for ingestion stuff.\n\n[Bruin CLI](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin) could also fit the bill here since it is like dbt, but does ingestion, transformation with SQL and Python, orchestration, quality, and governance. It is open-source, you can run it anywhere you'd like.\n\nHit me up if you'd like to chat, sounds like an interesting problem you are tackling. Good luck!",

But it allow your to grow, avoid potential vendor locking, reduce DW cost by doing preaggregation yourself before loading it in redshift, etc, etc. But all of this requires a lot of effort? Which might be slowing you down to achieving you company goals. If you have a big enough data team it make sense, if you are pretty small the loading directly to redshift is very appealing.\n\nYou’ll always have the possibility to offload the data from redshift to s3 in the futur if that’s needed but you won’t shoot yourself in the foot and not deliver anything for the first 6 months.\n\nIn terms of pricing, you are analyzing storage cost which shouldn’t be a factor imo. Yes storage is way cheaper in s3. But the size of data you have in SAP isn’t probably not that big. You need to define that first. For example I don’t see a world where you have a terabyte of data to load from SAP to redshift. A terabyte of text files is a LOT of data for things that are entered manually or mostly in SAP. \n\nNow let’s say you have a terabyte of data because your company has a lot there (which you probably don’t) then having the storage cost in redshift would be something are 25$ per month for the hole data set. Our conversation here cost more than that. Depending on type of s3 storage you might save a lot but storage is negligible for small datasets.\n\nThe real DW cost is compute, and that needs to be considered. \n\nI know the business wants SAP and ALL other sources, but you should chunk this a lot so you endup delivering things in small chunks. Everyone wants everything yesterday but that’s not how things work. Start with SAP but not all, the most relevant concepts because there’s probably a lot of tables there to sync, clean, transform to make the data usable. The goal of you DW is to make data usable but also to get a single source of truth. If you just load raw data in and let business build dashboard on top of the raw data I can tell you this is going to be a mess in 2 months. \n\nStart small, get the table requirements that allow you to clean the data, make the data available, then repeat.\n\nTo go back on pricing, if for example you think that you have A LOT of data multiple terabytes. And that the storage cost will be around 1000$ a month because you have 40 terabytes to load and that can be an issue, then I can assure you, you won’t like the Fivetran Bill. If you need to think about the storage cost, then you need to rearchitect this because Fivetran is not the option you are looking for. It’s very good to load data quickly. It gets insanely expensive when you start to really use it. Most companies won’t have issue with fivetran cost because most company don’t have a lot of data.\n\nGood luck",

See correct config to save processing and make it write faster, as no retention period. You may also apply clustering rules here.\n\nThen I would ask, do you really need redshift? I know it exists and basically how it works but never worked since I mostly only move data from staging area to silver and gold areas in S3, using again Delta/iceberg, leaving data with dimensional modeling as needed by business.\nI generally use Databricks/snowflake to process it,but so far I know, you can also use Glue for it.\nDelta/iceberg have acid properties/time travel/and others that can be selected and designed as your need, replicating redshift pros.\n\nIf it is enough, you totally save redshift costs, and got a simpler arch in only one place. If you really need redshift you send only totally needed tables there.

If you currently only require a structured warehouse that doesn’t require a large quantity of tables with potentially a large amount of rows and/or columns and you don’t foresee that changing anytime soon, then maybe go the easier route directly into Redshift. But let’s say in the next 3 years the data requirements explode and you need to house triple the size of data your currently hold or start to introduce unstructured data types, then building out the Glue pipelines from S3 to Redshift now will build a solid foundation for the future.\n\nAgain, take my response with a grain of salt as this is coming from a more junior perspective.",

For now the size of the data is very less like max 50gb worth 10 years of data.\nFor this much data, direct redshift would be ideal. But considering the future, if data size increases, it will be a problem. Although data honestly wouldn’t spike much. \n\nComing to your point where if redshift is even needed: yes I feel so because we currently have tableau connected directly to sap where the devs created views which consume a lot of compute making dashboards slow. If we use s3 tables, we will have to use Athena for querying and connect that to tableau, and we have a lot of complex queries/views built on top. I don’t think it’s a good solution to use Athena as our query engine.\n\nAnd I am the only DE here so it will be difficult for me to write code for every table and it’s upsert logic if it lands in s3 first.

Developer/Team/Enterprise are all tiers within dbt Cloud, and yes, the semantic layer for PowerBI is Cloud-only. Fusion is a feature within the Cloud product.\n\nHere's the thing though: we were on the Teams plan and everything was fine until we hit 8+ people. Then dbt Sales basically forced us into Enterprise tier. The initial quote? $300/seat/month on a 3-year contract. Even after heavy negotiation we only got it down to $220/seat/month.\n\nFor context, that's $26,400/year for 10 people, which feels pretty steep for what's essentially a task scheduler running on top of open-source dbt.\n\nIf you're just getting started with the engineering side, I'd honestly suggest sticking with dbt Core + your own orchestration (Airflow, GitHub Actions, whatever). The semantic layer is nice, but probably not worth $20-30k/year for a small team. You could build your own metrics layer or look at alternatives for way less.\n\nJust something to keep in mind as your team grows. The jump from Teams to Enterprise pricing is brutal.",

We have already a lot of tools, would be nice to have a way to prepare my graph from big tables on spark with graphframes, do deduplication, projection, etc.; save it to the standradazed format and after that read by in-memory tool like DuckDB or Kuzu. Something like Iceberg that connects different tools by one standard, but for graphs. And yes, GraphAr is about Property Graph, not RDF.",

They’re powerful tools, but for most of my early projects, SQL could have solved 90% of my problems faster and more cleanly. SQL is easier to debug, easier to optimize, and much more universal across platforms. If I could go back, I’d master SQL-based transformation first before diving deep into dataframe libraries.\n\nThat’s why, instead of jumping straight into Docker/Airflow, I’d start with a SQL-centric transformation tool like dbt (or Bruin, which also lets you run Python and handle ingestion). This will teach you the fundamentals of data modeling and pipeline design without the operational complexity of containers and schedulers. Since you already use Tableau, learning the “one step before the dashboard” will make the whole puzzle click.\n\nAnother big lesson: don’t get lost in technical rabbit holes. The fastest way to grow is to chase the highest-impact business problems, things that save your team time, increase accuracy, or unlock new capabilities. If you focus there, you’ll naturally pick up the right technical skills along the way.\n\nAlso, don’t work in isolation. Get your code reviewed, and review others’ work. You’ll learn more from those reviews than from most courses.\n\nIf I were mapping a path for you, it’d be:\n\n1. Master SQL + data modeling (dbt/Bruin/SQLMesh)\n2. Add Python tasks in the pipeline only when needed\n3. Develop a tool in Streamlit and deploy it for the use of business team\n4. Develop an ML model, and deploy it.\n\nYou’ll hit Docker and Airflow eventually, but starting with modeling skills will make everything else much easier.",

Even more if you are a very small team of 1.\n\nAlso this is nice , but doesn’t seem manageable by only you. It’s a lot.

As a data engineer I consider it's part of my job.\nMy concerns about DBT is that it's a simple product but not sealable in the future.

With Spark jobs I can fully test queries making sure to handle edge cases properly and it's easier to scale jobs when data volume will grow, with DBT running on GitHub actions runners we are limited in performance and from my point of view it's not a clean way to schedule jobs: no clear monitoring, retry policies etc. like with Airflow for example",

Actually quite nice overview in the automatically generated reports with stats on all your metadata in your profiling. It is annoying that you have log in to a different system to see them, but you can extract the metadata through the API if you want to collect it in your regular data warehouse and do your own reports.\n\nBut it is expensive.

It has always been a manual effort to get good quality business information about the data. It is almost a data project unto itself.\n\nThis however is just the start. You will probably want to document lineage, transformation, quality, etc. Those are all needed and highly helpful but take time and effort to establish.

There were arguments to be made for separate - the data volume of these use cases is lower than our analytical workloads, and so Azure Functions/Logic Apps could be sufficient. However, then we would need to use a non-Databricks orchestrator, which would be a bit annoying for some of the multi-step operational workflows. Doing it in Databricks meant that all of our data jobs live in one place and are orchestrated through one set of tools, regardless of whether they’re operational or analytical in nature. Databricks Asset Bundles have been great for us in this regard, in terms of allowing us to define our job configurations as code. \n\nOnce we got past that, we came back to the medallion. We landed the operational data in its own schema in our bronze catalog, but rather than moving it to “silver”, we created an operations catalog that serves as the use-case layer for all of these operational pipelines. They’re still sourced from bronze, and in the future, we might source analytical “silver” tables from either the bronze or operational catalogs, but this approach has been working well for us.\n\nWe leverage Databricks secrets (backed by Azure Key Vault) for all of our connection secrets, and give our service principals READ access to the scope in each environment. We have also modularized our code for SFTP/FTP into a helper library so we don’t have to maintain the same logic in each pipeline. We try to stick to asynchronous patterns for our downstream writes (e.g. we drop off a file somewhere and some downstream system picks it up), but if we had to, we could also make a direct API connection and write our data that way. We just haven’t really had to do that for our use cases thus far.",

By passing a few secrets to our helper class, the helper handles the rest and supports both key and credential-based auth. It saves us from having to write the same 30-40 lines of code in each pipeline, since we can instantiate our connection object with a single line of code. Our class also has prebuilt functions for getting/putting a file, checking a hash of a file against a previous version, and a few other operations we have found helpful.",

I worked as a chef for 10 years and before that in media and now I transitioned to programming.\nOne thing that was worth it from the bootcamp that helped me a lot was the access to mentors. I have been thinking that it is a shame that a lot of people pay so much money just to access to a weekly 30 min call with a mentor (sometimes even less). The material to learn is already online with even well structured tutorials or learning path, but free mentoring options are missing.\n\nI have been planning for quite some time to build a website in which programmers and other professionals can offer free mentoring options for people who are learning or starting. It doesn’t have to be for a long time or long sessions but some guidance or even code review could work. \n\nWould you be open to help me build this project? Would anybody be interested in something like this? Does a similar platform exist? It has to be completely free of charge (kind of like freecodecamp but for mentoring)",

My job title is frontend software engineer, but I go by software developer in casual conversation. I don't do anything with web or apps...I haven't built a website in years. I do use front end technology though and create tools for the front end teams that are building out web applications, just not anything I'm involved with directly. So calling me a web developer or app developer would be flat out wrong cause it's not what I do.\n\nThe majority of my friends in tech are back end software engineers, and the mere mention of any front end/web tech makes them gag. 😂",

Buy the physical book.\n1. Create a distraction free work area\n1. Disable your internet on your computer\n1. Place your phone where you can't see, just seeing the phone will distract you. \n1. Figure out how much time per day, you want to study the book. Create a schedule. \n1. Read the book, take notes, and take a 5 minute break every  25 minutes. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)\n1. Rinse and repeat.\n\nTwo years and you still don't understand python? You really need to ask yourself, why do you want to learn python, the reason why it's taking you so long, its because you have reservations of learning python because you have no clear idea, why you want to learn, in the first place. \n\n**PS:** Don't post your age on social media, now that is plain stupid, if not dangerous.",

However, it doesn't understand how to associate that 2D array with parts of the cube. It gets it upside down or backwards. I feed it screenshots, and it still can't figure out what's going on. It keeps proclaiming \"this will fix it\" and makes some random changes.\n\nHaving said that, I did get it to work, eventually. If I had to do it on my own, I would probably have never started. It seemed too daunting, that I had to learn too many new things. So, it got me started, and while I was frustrated at times, it got me a lot closer to finishing than I would have done just by myself.\n\nIt's the first coding project I've completed on my own since, well, almost ever.\n\nI think someone who knows NOTHING only builds really small stuff or has it solve homework problems. I can't imagine they get a real app working.\n\nThose who think AI will take over and don't want to learn programming should try it out.

You have to do that simple stuff first though. Those are the building blocks of every project. Just tough it out for a bit and then you'll have a clearer picture. ",

I also did the website redesign (although I was building pages based off wireframes and a spec written by someone else, I'm not a graphical person). About a week after the launch the whole company went into administration, so no one really ever got to use my new website.\n\nIt was a small multinational and I was working out of their HQ. The web team was basically only 2 of us, and my boss spent most of his time working on the ecommerce site, so I got a huge amount of freedom to learn and try new things.\n\n  \nEdit: If anyone's wondering how long ago this was, I was working with classic ASP, asp.net 1.1 and webforms (which were all cutting edge at the time).

For example, if I want to write a function that calculates the cumulative age of all the users of the system, the input is the user list, and the output is a number. Then, I know that number needs to be a sum of each age of each user. So, I need to get user age from user entry. So, I need to compare their birth date with current date.

        "body": "Honestly, there is no such thing as a \"programmer's mindset\". That's a myth and a general excuse for people too lazy to invest the necessary effort, discipline, persistence, diligence, and work to learn.\n\nThere are things that can make learning easier, such as being a logically inclined person, but even that can be improved and learned.\n\nI am a firm believer that most (not all) people can actually learn programming to a certain degree. They won't all be able to reach a professional level, but they can definitely learn it.\n\nAfter all, programming is just creating and translating steps to solve a problem in such a way that the computer can execute these steps.\n\nWe humans solve problems all day long, just we mostly don't even notice it as it is intrinsic. We work in steps every single second of the day, but we don't realize it.\n\nLearning programming is learning to consciously devise steps, to utilize our intrinsic ability to think in steps consciously.\n\nMost new learners focus way too much on the *code*, on the *implementation* in a *programming language*, which is only the last part of the process. Sure, it is absolutely necessary to learn a *programming language*, but after all this is just very limited vocabulary and very simple grammar.\n\nThe real part of programming happens way before the code. It is the process of analyzing, breaking apart problems/tasks and solving them in sequences of discrete steps (again, a skill that we generally are intrinsically good with) that *then* can be *implemented* in any programming language.\n\nHere is also the problem with most tutorials and with many, even high quality courses: they focus too much on the code and too little on the design, on guiding the learner to devise the solutions.\n\nWhen I started out with programming, there were no tutorials. There was no internet. There were barely any knowledgeable people in my (rural) area. It was way back in the first half of the 1980s in the advent of the \"home computers\" (Commodore ViC20, C64, BBC micro, Acorn, Amstrad CPC-464, etc.). All I had was the BASIC (programming language) manual that came with my computer and a lot of curiosity. A bit later, we had some \"programming\" lessons (in double quotes because it was more a joke than anything serious) at school - one lesson per week where 8 people were crammed around 4 Apple II Europlus computers where we initially learnt AppleSoft Basic and later UCSD Pascal. Our teacher made us draw flow charts before we were even allowed anywhere near the computer. This seriously helped. Using a visual representation of the steps to solve our tasks made us think more about the actual steps than about their *implementation* in a programming language.\n\nFlow charts, Nassi-Shneiderman charts, bulleted lists, pseudo-code, all of these help and are somewhat underrepresented in modern computer learning. If people started out learning these for short time, they would learn much easier and much faster as most learners don't fail at the *languages*, but fail on *programming*.\n\nThe above is also the reason Harvard chose to start with *Scratch* for their famous CS50 course. It is a visual programming language (in the style of Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams) that lets the learners focus on the *algorithm* on the *steps* instead of on an actual *programming language* with its keywords and grammar. Yes, Scratch comes across as childish because after all it was designed by the MIT to teach young kids programming, but that is actually the biggest advantage of it. Way too many people dismiss Scratch as childish and useless, yet, had they invested a couple hours with it, they would have seen its value.\n\nWay too many posts here are in the tone of \"I've learnt programming language X, Y, and Z, but still cannot program\". Why? Because they all focused on the wrong thing. They focused on the *implementation*, on the *end product*, on the completed car, instead of focusing on the *design process, the considerations, the decisions* that ultimately *lead* to the *implementations*.\n\nSimilarly, way too many people claim \"they can *read and understand* code, but not *write* it\". Similarly, just because one can *read and understand* novels it doesn't automatically enable them to *write* meaningful, comprehensive, fully developed ones.\n\nThen, we have the \"I've watched X tutorials, read Y books, but cannot program\" people. Yes, sure, you know the theory, but you have never applied your skills in practice. This is like sitting in the desert and watching countless Olympic Splash Diving videos and reading all about it. Unless you get wet and actually do it, everything will just be plain theory and you will fail miserably in practice.\n\nPractice is the key. Even a step further: independent practice. It's not *copying* tutorial code after tutorial code. It's sitting down, thinking about something to program and starting working on it, without tutorials, without AI (don't get me started on that for learners), only with one's own work.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with tutorials for a *certain use case*, e.g. for small, detailed, specific parts where one is unsure, but not for entire projects, e.g. the typical \"how to build X in language Y\" ones. If you need something special, e.g. \"how to work with SQLite tables in Python sqlite3\" or something alike, tutorials, blogs, etc. are perfectly fine.\n\nToo many people fall into *tutorial hell* because they don't dare to just simply start working on their own. They are afraid of not achieving their goals, they are afraid of failure, which is the completely wrong mindset for programming. Failure is an important part of learning. It is *gained experience*. It is equally important to know how not to do something as how to do something.\n\nThen, we have the \"do projects\" people who think that projects need to be huge, complex beasts and that instantly get discouraged by that thought. Again, wrong mentality. Every single program, no matter how small, is a project. One can only grow with their projects. People need to start small and simple and then work their way up to gradually larger and more complex projects.\n\nThen, we have the people who despair because they see the huge amount that is there to learn and only look at the summit, at the vast mountain of learning ahead of them instead of looking at the *path* ahead. One does not climb a mountain by just focusing on the summit. One climbs a mountain by looking at the path ahead and taking one step after the other.\n\nThen, we have the ones who declare \"programming isn't for me\" after investing mere *hours* (couple days/weeks) without much effort. Learning programming takes effort and doesn't come natural.\n\n*Fast tracking* in programming doesn't work (it actually doesn't work in any trained skill). There is no 0 to 100 in no time. Learning anything is a marathon, not a sprint. Slow and steady wins the race.\n\n> Recommend any books, courses, etc. that helped you most.\n\nHere is a knack. The most helpful books have actually fairly little to do with *programming*. They are about the *design*, the steps before the actual programs.\n\nThe typical recommendations for this are:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nAnd if you're hardcore: \"The Art of Computer Programming\" by Donald Knuth et.al.",

Someone posted a question asking something along the lines of 'What is the most important trait in a programmer?' and the most upvoted answer by a country mile was simply 'Perserverance'. It's euphoric when all the parts of a solution click into place and we get to sit back and watch it fire on all cylinders, but man it's a rough road to get there at times. The ability to stick with it when everythings broken and nothing makes sense is crucial.\n\nThat leads me nicely onto the second one really - embracing and even celebrating failure. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist that has a few podcasts on how learning works, and listening to him explain that it's repeated failure that triggers the learning process really changed my attitude and I wish I'd embraced it sooner. There's a quote along the lines of 'The master has failed more times than the apprentice has even tried', and whilst I probably spread my interests too thinly to master anything in particular, I'm doing my best to fail my way there.",

And sometimes those ways aren't actually very productive, or sometimes those ways are productive for them but only because they think of things in an unusual way, and sometimes someone thinks of a new way that works for a lot people and everyone gets excited about this new way for a while until other people figure out the new way's short comings and go back to looking for better ones.\n\nEven in math, it's arbitrary. You only have clarity because you declare it by fiat--you make up some premises and rules because you think they are interesting or they will be informative in some way, then you try to figure out all the consequences of the rules you made up. A lot of math is about just using existing rules to figure out new things within that ruleset, and a lot of different math is thinking of entirely new rulesets that seem interesting and generative.\n\nProgramming, and trying to define encapsulation is more like the second kind of math.",

At the time these words were coined, Fortran and COBOL were the dominant programming languages, and they were extremely barebones compared to the modern versions of those languages. It's hard to fathom just how much we take for granted with modern programming languages today.\n\nIn terms of encapsulation, folks were mostly just proposing what we now think of as modules or classes. Basically, the idea boils down to creating public facing APIs that do not expose their inner variables. I like [this source](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/01-objects/02-encapsulation/) which quotes from some of the originators of OOP-- Dave Parnas and Alan Kay. \n\n> Parnas and his peers pushed for not just hiding the data, but also how the data was manipulated. By hiding these implementation details, they could prevent programmers who were used to the globally accessible variables of early programming languages from looking into our code and using a variable that we might change in the future.\n\nBarbara Liskov is another big name in the OOP world, and [she covers encapsulation in this fantastic paper](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/barbara-liskov/data-abstraction-and-hierarchy.pdf)\n\n> For abstraction to work, implementations must be encapsulated. If an implementation is encapsulated, then no other module can depend on its implementation details. Encapsulation guarantees that modules can be implemented and reimplemented independently; it is related to the principle of “information hiding” advocated by Parnas [15].\n\nThose three formed the basis of all modern OOP concepts. They are the definitive sources. I think much of the confusion comes from the second wave of folks who implemented the popular languages and who each definitely went their own way. Because their languages are so popular, their opinions are almost equally valid despite the fact that they all disagree with each other on minor things.\n\n- Bjarne Stroustrup\n- James Gosling\n- Brad Cox\n- Bertrand Meyer\n\nAs a side note, when discussing design patterns, there are a few definitive sources:\n\n- [Design Patterns](https://www.javier8a.com/itc/bd1/articulo.pdf) by the Gang of Four\n- Pattern Oriented Software Architecture, most notably volumes [one](https://daneshjavaji.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sznikak_jegyzet_pattern-oriented-sa_vol1.pdf) and [two](https://archive.org/details/patternorienteds0000unse_u5t3)\n- [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZoranLi/Books1/master/Patterns%20of%20Enterprise%20Application%20Architecture.pdf)\n\nHowever, most of those were written over twenty years ago, so [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/) is a good resource for putting these concepts into a modern context.",

Others write that encapsulation is about *hiding things* — like, you add `private` where needed and boom, that’s encapsulation. Then there’s the group that says it’s about combining data and methods together. And so on.\n\nAnd N-O-B-O-D-Y ever cites anything to back up their claims. It’s like: *“Well, I said it, so you should believe me.”*\n\nSo in the end, I can go to an interview, and the interviewers can tell me absolute nonsense about OOP — and I can’t even call them out on it, because there’s no monumental work, no axiom, no precise definition from an authority that I can point to and say, **“No, this is the correct one.”**\n\nEveryone just interprets it however they like, which leads to the absurd situation where: if I’m the lead on a project, then *my* definitions are the truth.

So I can speed up my productivity too, you know.\n\nI tried using AIs to handle basic tasks for me when everyone started saying that AI would ruin programmers' lives and produce outdated, broken, and bug-ridden code. Yeah, it might be faster because some parts are already done and just need tweaking, but that works for small scripts since they are simple and easy to track and fix. However, it's impossible for an AI to create a full app exactly as you want because you can't specify all the details. There will always be things you do through pure automation simply because you're used to coding.\n\nLast time I asked an AI to write a server.js to run express, and it just didn’t work. I had to write everything again lol (by writing everything again, I mean going to my GitHub and copying and pasting my last server.js, which was also copy-pasted from my previous project).\n\nSo no, AI does not destroy programming. There are no AI writing apps on demand, you could use something like Copilot, but it won't make a big difference unless you're doing repetitive coding. And if you are doing that, you're probably coding in the wrong way.\n\nPeople also talk about AI replacing artists, but artists are still working because AI can do some things to represent your ideas. However, it will never capture everything the way you want because your ideas need a brain with empathy to understand what you truly mean and what you want to do it as you wish. An AI can only replicate what you do, and all the details you don't provide, the AI will just do whatever it wants.\n\nYou can tell an artist, \"I want my character to be like Jhon Wick,\" and they will take your ideas and adapt them to fit Jhon Wick vibes, while an AI will probably do Jhon Wick and just add some wonky details on top of it.",

You can also sit in your room and program side projects all day. At some point you have to face reality, and find a way to make money and have some kind of success in your life.

It shows you're not giving up, and that's a mindset you must keep if you really want to become a programmer - especially a good one.\n\nIn general, experience > degree. I'm not a CS graduate myself - I actually studied chemistry - but I've still found my dream job writing code. It's absolutely possible.\n\nBecoming a good programmer is so much more than just hitting keys and shipping code. You'll need to accept the endless grind. In the beginning, everything feels exciting and kind of easy. Then reality hits. And honestly? There's barely any course out there that truly teaches you how to think like a developer - the pattern recognition, the problem-solving mindset, the \"sixth sense\" for asking the right questions.\n\nThat said, not studying at all is a bad idea. You don't want to end up without direction or skills that can support you. But studying doesn't have to mean going to university. I'm from Germany, and here many young people start paid trainee/apprenticeship programs for around 3 years to learn a profession. Maybe something like that exists where you are too?\n\nIf university isn't an option for you - especially if it's expensive or forces you into debt for something you're not passionate about - then yeah, don't rush into it. It could become a trap.\n\nGiven your situation, there's no guaranteed path. But if I were you, I'd try to find a mentor - even if it costs money. Good guidance can save you a lot of wasted time and effort.\n\nAlso: besides programming and avoiding university in your city, what else interests you? Maybe you can find some creative crossover - tech isn't just web apps and games. There's a lot of space to combine different passions.\n\nWhatever you decide, don't just think about the next year. Think in decades. It's your life - build something that lasts.",

No. They could just give you array construction and indexing and leave writing methods like map(), reduce(), join(), forEach(), find(), and so on up to each programmer. And then somebody would write a library that has 50+ methods that do all those things, and everybody would include that library in their code, except that some people would use a different library or no library at all, and you’d be here asking why the language doesn’t just expose all that functionality so that it’s standardized.\n\n> Seems like massive overkill. JS wasn't THAT bad until I started learning about arrays.\n\nWhich methods would you eliminate?",

You download an *SDK* (software development kit)\n2. You write your code\n3. You compile/package it (or not, depending on the language)\n\nFirst off, what you're downloading is not the language, as that is more of an abstract concept, it's software that uses the language to build software. That can include an interpreter (e.g. with Python), a compiler (c), a runtime (java), and other tools such as a debugger.\n\nWriting your code is what you do with e.g. pycharm, but you can do that with anything. At the end of the day, what only matters is the content of the files, so whether you write it with pycharm, notepad, visual studio, or Morse code doesn't matter (it matters to you of course, not to the machine).\n\nAnd then there's what you're actually inquiring about. This steps is what depends most on the technology you're using. With Python, there isn't really anything more to do: you write your scripts, ...and that's it. You just run them and that's your software. That makes it easy and convenient, but not very user friendly which is one reason why you generally don't use python (directly) for user facing applications. For java, the final step is compiling into jar files, or an exe that will use the jar. That's already what you're doing when testing it while writing the code. The only difference is you might be including or removing some stuff from the final binary that you ship to users. Similarly for other compiled languages such as c and c++, it's the same story. The only difference is, you have to compile for each configuration (architecture, os, etc.), but don't need the user to download a runtime. Then for web stuff like JavaScript, it's a bit more complex since you have to host the website on the internet if you want people to access it. But here it's actually the most similar to what you were describing: you do use a software that brings your software to life, the browser! It's a bit similar to Java's runtime but way more involved \n\n\nI hope this kind of makes sense? It's hard to explain without knowing what you know and understand but hopefully I gave a somewhat clear picture of how it works. And don't worry about not understanding all of it, the world of software is vast and complex and developing software is as much about writing the code than it is about the final steps of deployment!",

There isn't a single answer for every type of thing you want to build.\n\nIn general if you want to build an app that you want others to be able to use, here are the most popular options:\n\n1. Make a website. It will cost you $10/year for your own domain name like Grumpy\\_Gremlin49.com, and $5 - 10/month to host the website. You'll need to learn some HTML and CSS to design the content, but most of the logic can be implemented in Python. The best part about the web is that it's the easiest for end users - they just type in your url and they're immediately using your app.\n\n2. Make a mobile app. For iOS it costs $99 to become a developer. You either make an iOS or Android only app using the special languages and frameworks designed for that, or you use a cross-platform framework designed to let you build an app once. There's a framework for making mobile apps with Python (Kivy) but it's not very professional. You upload your app to the play store / app store and then users can download it and use it.\n\n3. Make a desktop app. You can do that with Python. The main problem is getting it to users. You'd need a website to distribute it (see #1), and browsers and virus scanners will try to stop users from installing and running it. This is a fine solution for sending to a friend or making an internal app for a business, but these days making a good cross-platform desktop app for end users is a real pain. If you want to make an app for the Mac or Microsoft app stores, that does solve the virus scanner problem but it limits what your app is allowed to do.\n\nSo your next step is to pick one. The more specific the better. Pick something like web or iOS. Don't say \"all of the above\". Start somewhere.",

One of the mechanisms to do this is to containerize your application so that all system dependencies are bundled into the container (Docker is one of the easiest containerization tools; if you want, you should research Docker and Dockerfile).\n\nAfter the above packaging step (the usual artifact at the end of this stage is a deployable unit, in this case called a \"container image\"), you will need to then research how/where to host your application. If you are targetting running this code in the cloud (say AWS for eg), you will then need to research and decide whether you want to use Elastic Container Service (ECS) or a kubernetes-based solution. If going with ECS, most of the infrastructure-provisioning will already be taken care of - you will simply sign up for an AWS account, and then configure what tier you want to choose (depending on how heavy your application is and also depending on volume of users). Then comes the actual deployment.\n\n  \nI have skipped some steps like unit testing, CI builds, connection to a database, security (both runtime/dynamic scans and static scans). Depending on your comfort level and (I assume) your aim to get to a full-fledged application, you will need to research these as well. Ofc, if your application needs a UI, and assuming your python code is simply exposing API endpoints, you will then need to research react / angular / nextjs / vuejs /  etc (javascript frameworks) that will be used to build the UI for your application.

Spending an afternoon learning how to use your IDE's debugger will save you hundreds of hours later.\n* Trace the execution path systematically - step through your code in the order it actually runs, not just how you think it should run. Use the debugger's \"step over/into\" functions or add print statements to follow the flow and catch where logic diverges from your expectations.\n* Use 'Rubber duck debugging': explain your code line by line to someone (or a rubber duck). You'll often catch the issue while explaining.\n\nDebugging - like programming - is systematic. Don't approach it like guesswork, but like a detective or scientist: observe the symptoms, form hypotheses, test them one by one, and let the evidence guide you to the root cause.",

Debugging is all about critical thinking.\n\nLearn how to use a debugger, and add logging to your program.

        "body": "That's the wrong approach. Randomly changing things will likely break stuff.\n\nHere's the analogy. Imagine you have a car (and I'm no mechanic), and it's having some issues. You open the hood of the car, and start randomly doing stuff, hoping the problem will go away.\n\nDo you think that's a solid approach to fixing the car? Would a real mechanic do that? No, they would try to figure out what the problem is. Of course, being experienced, they have a series of tests they can do to isolate the problem and the confirm it is the problem, and they have an idea how to solve the problem.\n\nIn a way, you need to do the same. Randomly changing your code is not going to fix it just like randomly doing stuff to a car engine won't fix it. You need to understand your code.\n\nBecause I've taught beginners, I've seen this \"I do random stuff and hope to fix it\" before. Why do beginners try this approach even as they would admit, it won't likely work.\n\nIt's because the code looks daunting. If I say, tell me what each line of code does, one step at a time. Be the computer. Do each step. To a beginner, that seems like crazy slow. It would take forever to do that (even though they wrote the code). Random fixes is a lot quicker. Do something rather than do the right thing which is slow and tedious.\n\nOK, so some steps.\n\n**Determine why you think your program is broken**\n\nI've had students who tell me their program doesn't work. When I press them, and ask \"what's wrong\", they just say it doesn't work.\n\nWhat they really need to say is, \"I think this is wrong because when I put in value X, I get answer Y, when I expect Z\". Those three parts are key. What input (X) did you use? What answer (Y) did you get? And what answer did you expect (Z)? \n\nThis is the first step to debugging. Why do you think it's wrong?\n\n**Try a smaller input**\n\nThe next step is to put in the smallest input that causes the problem. Sometimes, we'd give students some sample inputs that were pretty lengthy. Their code would break, but it was hard for them to figure what was going on because the input was so lengthy, they didn't know what part was causing the problem (imagine the input is an array of numbers).\n\nThe first step is to see if it can handle the smallest input possible (say, an array with one element).\n\n**Test your functions**\n\nA smaller version is to test functions. Determine\n\n* what are the input parameters\n* given certain input values, what are the output values\n\n**Write more small functions**\n\nInstead of writing one big `main()`, break things up into small functions. Then, you can test each function.\n\nWrite a comment for each function and give some sample inputs and expected outputs for that function.\n\n**Test as you go along**\n\nDon't write all the code with no testing, then test after you wrote all that code. This won't help if the code is already written, but can help in future coding.",

I figure that at this point, people will look at the work I've done and what I can do, because I've had a decade to produce things, but perhaps if I hadn't made anything yet, it'd be much more helpful to indicate I had a vague idea of what I was doing at least.\n\nSome members of my family like that I have it for some reason, but personally, if I could go back, I wouldn't bother. I didn't learn anything I wasn't familiar with already from work and personal research, and some aspects of what was taught would actively hinder my job if I tried implementing them as it would slow productivity to a crawl.\n\nI did mine part-time, I can't imagine doing it full-time. If you have already got the ability, and you have some way to show it, I really don't think a degree is going to change things any more than spitting in the ocean. The times I've had bigger offers have all been because they've seen something I've done and liked it, but I've never had anyone stop to mention the lack of degree, or ask about it since I got it.\n\nOf course, I imagine different goals and different locations might change that, from my understanding, large multinationals tend to like degrees, but I'd rather switch to a different career than work for any of them.",

It tracked the time spent on the answers, and I timed myself doing it sober for about 20 minutes, ingested a shit ton of cannabis and did it again. Then I spent the next few days analyzing the difference in performance using Python. I can never bring that up in an interview but I genuinely enjoyed doing it. I don’t regret it. \n\nOverall my point is you’ll never regret having fun. I don’t regret the time I spend playing video games, and I definitely don’t regret any time spent that has practical benefits to me. You should be psyched that you’re enjoying this stuff.

I haven't really heard about people extracting data and editing the code though, just playing the games with the ROMs..\n\nIn some cases, it sounds like you can save (AKA \"dump\") game cartridge ROMs directly on a console and save them to an SD card.  For instance, for a Nintendo 3DS, I found [this guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/dumping-titles-and-game-cartridges.html).  For older systems,\n\nTo look at the code though, you could use a disassembler and load the ROM into it - but it would only show you the assembly language instructions; you can't extract the original higher level code (i.e., C) from that.  Reading assembly code and understanding what it's trying to do takes significant effort, as it's about as low-level as you can get.  And if you want to make changes, you'd modify the instructions and re-assemble it (it doesn't get re-compiled like a higher-level language does).",

It won't be good, I mean you will probably find that boring and it will just discourage you.\n\n\n\nAnd to answer your question:  \nI remember long-long time ago as one of my first project I created a calculator in html+js. It was interesting to see something in a browser which was actually running. Then I wanted to know more. One project which I still don't know after like 20 years how I was able to pull of was a keylogger on Windows. I learned a LOT about C/C++ and Windows internal calls, how to \"hide\" it in the background etc. I still have that code. (I might have used it on a school computer and might have got myself a social media invitation for a long-gone site.)\n\nJust try to do something for yourself, it will give you motivation and when you finish you'll feel accomplishment.",

        "body": "Changing a language is kind of dangerous. Imagine a language changed every 3 years. You write a bunch of code this year. Three years from now, they change it, and now your code is broken. Does that seem reasonable? Many beginners feel code changes and they want to learn the latest, not realizing, using the same argument, that in a few years, they'd have to learn something new because the current stuff \"became obsolete\".\n\nOf course, 20 years is a long time, but languages that last time often change without breaking.\n\nFor example, Java has come out with new versions over the past 30+ years. Still, in principle, code written back then would still run now. The biggest changes occurred roughly 20 years ago when generics were introduced. Yes, there are a some other features that came out, but if you stuck mostly to that technology, you'd still be decently fine in Java. You'd only add to that knowledge instead of throwing it away.\n\nKeep in mind that code tends to stay around for long periods of time. Code can last 20 years or even longer. If you had to rewrite that code just to keep it up-to-date, that would be crazy amounts of unnecessary work. Beginners think new code is written all the time. They hear Rust is big, so they think millions of lines of Java code are tossed out, and they rewrite it all, not realizing how hard it is to rewrite code. If it took years to write, it takes years to rewrite.\n\nNow, there are things that have gotten old, but mostly in web technology. Even so, some still hangs around. I thought PHP went away 20 years ago. It's still around. People still use it because web sites were written 20 years ago. Sure, everyone tells you to learn React or something newer.\n\nThere was a posted months ago that wanted to learn Carbon, Google's answer to C++. It's not even been released, had no compiler that was available, and is still (for all I know) in limbo today. If they just learned C or Java, they'd be in better shape.\n\nAlso, many programmers learn more than one language, so even if you never use C again, learning to program translates (somewhat) to learning new languages, so it's not wasted time even if you think it is wasted time. The fact is, to learn programming, you will ultimately \"waste time\". Avoiding mistakes often means avoiding learning.",

At times you will manage to fit some together and as you connect more pieces it will get easier and easier to find new connections. Focus on the fundamentals and try to have some sort of own project at the side that you can tinker with on your own when you feel like it.\n\nMy own experience - I found it hard when I had gotten my degree to structure and design code. Like you I felt frustrated and a bit lost. We had very briefly talked about the concept of Clean Code during one of the courses without going in-depth at all so I ordered and read the book. I found it to be extremely helpful and taught me structure and a bunch of common patterns and idioms when writing code in a very straightforward and helpful manner.\n\nLastly - if there was something that I wish the school had focused more on to prepare me and my fellow students for the real world, I'd wish we'd gotten more time to work with how online services talk with each other, what protocols do they use, how is information exchanged, request/response etc, as well as how you work with web/appservers etc. It was all very hand waved and the only server we had to setup was a light-weight Firebird local server to host our SQL-dbs.\n\nSo, personal opinion - focus on learning the programming fundamentals, read Clean Code, and check out how apps communicate with each other and get som practice doing that.

The computer doesn't really care about how many variables you use.\n\nIt is much more tricky to write code other humans can understand. This doesn't really matter in this toy problem, but becomes quite important in larger or longer-term projects.\n\nFor humans, giving names to things matters. It can be worth pulling outoart of a computation and assigning it to a variable *just to give it a name*. In this sense, variable names and function names serve a similar purpose to comments, but names are easier to keep up to date as the code evolves.\n\nHere is how I as a very experienced programmer would refactor that code if this were a production problem (untested):\n\n    import re\n    import sys\n\n    EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS = {\n        \":)\": \"🙂\",\n        \":(\": \"🙁\",\n    }\n\n    EMOTICONS_PATTERN = re.compile(\"|\".join(re.escape(e) for e in EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS)\n\n    def _emojify(text: str) -> str:\n        # see https://stackoverflow.com/a/2400577\n        return EMOTICONS_PATTERN.sub(\n            lambda m: EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS[m[0]],\n            text,\n        )\n\n    def main():\n        for line in sys.stdin:\n            print(_emojify(line))\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n\nThere are a couple of fundamental differences that you might find distracting – using a replacement table instead of `str.replace()`, or transforming all input instead of prompting for a single line. The regex related stuff is a fixed pattern for applying multiple replacements to the same string.\n\nBut for the purpose of this discussion important observations are:\n\n* I think `_emojify()` is a better name than `convert()`. Converting *what*?\n* I decided against introducing additional local variables. They don't seem to add anything. In particular, naming a value just to immediately return it doesn't tend to provide much useful information to readers.\n* No comments like \"get input\". Comments are useful for providing information that's not visible in the code. If an `input()` function is called, I can already see that we're obtaining input. The thing that would benefit from a more detailed comment in my version would be the regex stuff, as this is highly non-obvious for people who don't already know this pattern. Unfortunately, this pattern has no name, but it has a canonical Stack Overflow answer.",

What you have to watch out for is\n\n* \"scope\" - the contexts that a name lives in, within a module/function etc., and\n* functions that change values, vs. return values.\n\nIn Python, when you assign a new value to the name \"user\\_input\", that is scoped in this case to the whole function.  In a larger function body, you might have loops etc., and you can negligently change a name that elsewhere you've been assuming represents its original value.  It's OK here, it could be a really bad move in another context.  You know, like old school guys like me will use 'i' for an index counter, and then use it again in another loop inside that, and that of course is not going to work right.\n\nFor the change/return thing ... Somewhat miscategorized as such, because what we have here is a function return.  But from an object method.  The .replace.replace thing Harvard handed you here, you have to decide what you think about that.  It's vaguely familiar as if imported from a \"functional programming\" model, and I think Python programmers commonly get some jollies from doing things like that.  But it's a little less transparent what's going on in an OOP object.method model and I personally don't get the attraction.  I might split that up into separate assignments to user\\_input\\*.  Consider how that would relate to your question - would you want to reuse user\\_input, or have a trail of new identifiers - user\\_input, user\\_input\\_with\\_happy, user\\_input\\_with\\_happy\\_and\\_sad ...?

I know plenty of people in the field who did CS and SWE, and similar. It's barely a specialisation really. You will most probably discover that Software Engineering and Cloud Computing undergrad degrees share some kind of \"common first year\" with straight Computer Science degrees and about 10 other \"degree pathways\" at your university, to ensure everyone has the basic knowledge required to move on. After that period, at the beginning of each year, you'll get asked to choose some modules in addition to the core modules totalling the credits for the year. This is the \"specialisation\" aspect. Different degree pathways are just different module choices each subsequent year, which is why many universities allow you to switch between degrees before you get to modules that are only available on certain pathways (essentially change your degree title and pick other modules).\n\nWhether or not you will be ahead or behind your peers depends not solely on your degree pathway, but also on how well the *contents* (what you study) aligns with what you would like to do for work. You don't mention this (even though it should be the biggest factor in your decision) but assuming you want to be a Software Engineer, neither CS nor SWE will give you a large advantage over the other, and the module choices available are likely to be very similar. I've never personally met a Software Engineer with a Cloud Computing degree, but this doesn't mean much, as much of the content is likely to be very relevant.\n\nYou won't save any time, they're the same length. Feel free to skip any work experience years if you're confident in your ability to land a job. Use your best judgement.\n\nNote also that employers rarely care deeply about the exact degree title. \"Computer Science or similar relevant degree\" is common to see on job ads. They do often (not always) care that you get a 2:1/2:2 or above. Nobody regards 3rd well. I'll add from personal experience that I've had certain professional opportunities that were only open to people with 1st at undergrad, a full decade *after* getting the degree. You don't know what the future holds so make the most of it. I'm glad I did and richer for it. If you look at how your university calculates your final classification there's often an alternative formula that counts your first year marks (they award you the best mark using all formulas typically), so don't believe any nonsense like \"first year doesn't count\" etc. It might, depending on specifics.\n\nEdit to add: **A-levels are not 'instead of' a degree.** **No employer is going to pay much attention to your A-levels alone, and having an undergrad degree is preferred but not a hard requirement, to directly answer the title question.** You just need to take the A-levels that meet the requirements for university courses you're looking at. The requirements are listed on their sites. They usually either don't care about specific subjects, or list one subject they require you to have studied at A-level, possibly with grade requirements.",

You're not necessarily missing out on much if you take initiative on your own to round out the foundational theory you'd typically get in a general CS degree. Just make sure the specialization you’re picking doesn’t lock you in too tightly. Cloud and software engineering are great fields, but you’ll want some flexibility to explore and pivot if you find something else that clicks for you in your first or second year.

Moreover, If you don't use something, you'll forget it because your brain trims it out. When the time comes for you to use a concept you can simply read up on it to refresh your memory and use what you need. You say you hit a plateau doing LeetCode questions which is definitely to be expected, learning is a bell curve and as difficulty increases the rate at which you progress decreases. This is a good sign that you're at the end of that bell curve, and that you should keep at it even if progress feels minimal.

Their greatness was born in the gym with repetition.  Find a process that works for you and hammer it in with repetition.   This way, when time comes for you to perform it's automatic and requires little thought.  \n\nSecond, create a cheat sheet for you to easily reference hard to remember concepts.  I would suggest you physically create this sheet to help solidify terms and concepts and/or but it in a spreadsheet for quick referencing.  Once you feel you have a concept, command, and/or process down, remove or archive. \n\nThird, pace yourself.   This is your race.  Your race is different from mine and everyone else's.   Comparison is a thief of joy.  You should be disciplined and motivated in your race to reach your goals, but don't compare my race to yours.  I may have jet boots compared to your flip flops , but I may have a lead backpack on while you're wearing a linen shirt.  \n\nFinally, be honest with yourself. Our profession isn't for everyone.

You’re not nitpicking — you’re trying to build actual understanding, and that takes time. It’s 100% normal to not remember everything or to need to look things up multiple times. Everyone starts that way.\n\nIf you want to level up a bit without getting overwhelmed, here are a few simple tips:\n\n* **Keep a small notes doc** (which you’re already doing — big W)\n* **After each week**, try to build a *tiny* project using what you learned. Doesn’t need to be fancy — even a simple calculator or guessing game helps things stick.\n* **Don’t worry about memorizing syntax.** Focus on *what* each thing does and *why* it’s being used.\n* After a section, try explaining the concept to someone else (or even just to yourself out loud). It’s wild how much it helps.\n\nYou're doing the hardest part right now: showing up consistently. Trust me, this isn’t wasted time — it’s the foundation that makes future stuff way easier to grasp.

I'm selling it for low prices, and if you are interested (I am a teen web dev and could use any support I can get to improve my courses), I would really appreciate it. Don't feel pressured, I can't tell you what to do, but I just recommend my course if you want to learn JavaScript anywhere, from basic console.log() to classes and data structures.

It's a bit of a complex topic, so I'd suggest watching a YouTube video about it, but here's a short explanation:\n\nImagine you have a library of books. You could store those books in a `list`. If you store those books in a list, though, you have to check every single book to see if you have `Harry Potter` in your collection. Instead, you can put those books in a `set`. Books in a set are stored in piles. Each pile contains all the books starting with the same first two letters. So, to check if you have `Harry Potter`, you go directly to the `Ha` section. You don't have to go through the entire library.\n\nNow, let's say you only want one copy of each book, and you are given another copy of `Harry Potter`. You go to the `Ha` section and check for `Harry Potter`, if it is there, you just toss your new copy. If not, you add that copy to the `Ha` section.",

        "body": "The key idea behind sets/maps are that they use the value itself to determine its position in the list. \n\nAs an example, take a string \"Hello world\", which you want to add to the set. We call hash(\"Hello World\") and it returns the hash for that string (lets just say it is number like 66457). Then, we use that hash to determine the index the string belongs in, in the list. An easy way to do this for this example is to use the modulo operator. So say, our set implementation has 10 \"buckets\" (each bucket is an element in the underlying list), we can do 66457 % 10 = 7 so we place the string \"Hello world\" in index 7 of the underlying list(i.e. we place it in bucket 7).\n\nThe core idea here is that we never had to iterate through the list of buckets, we derived the index from the value \"Hello world\" itself. We dont have to look at any index other than index 7 for duplicates because (assuming our hash function is deterministic), \"Hello world\" *always* maps to index 7.\n\nHowever, there is a problem. Say there are 10 buckets, but we input 20 elements. Since there are more elements than there are buckets, its inevitable that some buckets will have multiple elements in them. Because of this, it is actually true that we have to do some iteration to find duplicates. If there are multiple elements in bucket 7, then we have to search the bucket to check if \"Hello world\" already exists. I'm not completely sure datastructure python uses to represent buckets though, if its lists then yeah there would be iteration but technically it could be any data structure.",

Python's hash tables use [open addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing), so the function needs to try multiple slots until it finds either an empty one or an existing object that's equal to the one being inserted. \n\nSets are fast because on average, this loop will terminate after a small number of iterations, *if* the hash function gives random-looking output *and* the fraction of occupied slots in the table is not too large. In order to make sure that second condition holds, the code calls [`set_table_resize`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L253-L330) to rebuild the table with a larger number of slots whenever the table gets too full.",

Scheme is a great way to learn about language design and functional programming, but as a beginner I found a course in python to be a great first language.  It's fairly simple and straight forward to learn the basics and it has a depth of features to explore depending on where your interests move as you learn more",

You say you want to avoid scratch, but note that the first week of cs50 is a gentle intro via scratch. Scratch is great for beginners though if he hasn't had any experience.  I've introduced a 10 year old to scratch and it's pretty phenomenal to see them get their head around basic programming concepts and talk about them without necessarily having to take on a text based syntax.  It's excellent preparation for taking on that text based language because you already understand how things work conceptually, learning your first text language is just adapting the concepts you know to new syntax.",

The second is the CometD protocol which keeps a long lived socket open between client and server that closes after either a three minute timeout or when a “push” update is returned. This is inefficient in terms of open tcp sockets for the server and cannot massively scale but can support client counts in the thousands or tens of thousands.\n\nIf you control the servers, you would allow inbound connections to the database and secure that point using a firewall and likely a vpn for an internal server. You would also strictly authenticate connections including restricting senders to known ip ranges. A common strategy is to route traffic through the vpn and only permit connections from it unless a device is physically in an office and authenticated on a trusted network.",

If you have lots of API servers, your database would need to connect to all of them and manage reconnecting to any that die. You could certainly build a solution for that, but why?",

Who know, maybe even real API keys that found their way into the codebase somehow.\n\nThat means, that we should still know fundamentals. Not sure what you meant by low-level stuff, but learning definitely will not hurt. Just make sure to apply your knowledge in practice and build something. That will improve your understanding of the material and help it stick in your memory for longer. Don't be afraid to reinvent the wheel for the sake of deeper understanding. At the same time, try to build something new, useful and challenging to really stress test your skills and \"level up\".\n\nThe difficult thing is to focus on cultivating the right kind of skills and fundamentals. There is just so much to learn and to know. I don't know the answer either, besides the obvious: learn 1-2 programming languages well enough, learn data structures, pick a framework, know network protocols (at least HTTP), maybe OAuth, maybe cybersecurity fundamentals could be useful. Yeah, take this with a grain of salt. I actually started reading \"Structured computer organization\" by Tanenbaum.

Just to see what they are capable of.\n\nI shared your hesitation at first. Then, I tried it recently and found it quite useful for generating boilerplate code and writing tests. No agentic stuff, just multi-line autocomplete mode. That way, you still are in control and can immediately review the suggested code snippet, but it saves you a lot a hand-typing.\n\nAs for the AI, I am not gonna be a judge of whether the hype is justified or not.

        "body": "Availability or practicality of DI can depend on the language (e.g. Java vs. JS). If the language has good options available and it's for work, like maybe an Android app or Java/Kotlin server application, I generally prefer DI tools, partly for the convenience in sweeping aside all the nagging wiring details, but more importantly to keep a notion of \"explicit inputs\", keeping injection tied to either the parameters of the constructor or at least the fields of the class. That lends itself to some nice static analysis / compile-time safety opportunities, like validating the DAG (for example w/ Guice or Dagger in Java). Tests can also stay easy to write since direct constructor injection is doable (some broader tests may need a test-specific DAG, esp. if you're using field injection instead of constructor injection in certain places, but narrower tests can often get away with a simpler setup using direct injection).\n\nOn smaller projects, especially client applications in JS, I tend to stick to simpler approaches, favoring doing my own wiring mostly with basic constructor injection, or sometimes using a service locator, and calling it a day. Trying to force DI there is a bit weird. (I'm not up to speed on the whole \"decorator metadata\" proposal and what effect that might have on DI libraries there.)\n\nWhen you use service locator, even though it may seem like it's splitting hairs, you're  subtly shifting away from that principle of \"explicit inputs\". Even if dependencies are resolved in the constructor, the act of retrieving them from a global locator makes the injection implicit, burying it within the implementation details, rather than expressing it more clearly at the interface/class level. DI tools in Java, for example, will exploit that using annotation processors at compile-time to build and validate the dependency graph. So the more you push things down to be more implicit, I guess hypothetically a crazy amount of reflection work would be needed to build the dependency graph, e.g. parsing the entire codebase, track all call sites, understand any funky dynamic behaviors.  Annotations make that info more structured, easily discoverable, and better suited for the task.\n\nAnd as far as the compile-time safety goes, and validating the graph, the benefits there are similar to the benefits of using types at all. It's all about catching certain kinds of errors at compile-time instead of pushing that into runtime (i.e. forcing your testers or users to catch bugs that are avoidable by just letting the machine validate your code based on what types you expect things to be, sort of like a spell-checker catching your typos before you publish an article to the world).  Service Locator can run the risk of planting hard-to-spot landmines, whereas certain DI tools will do some hard clever work to let you know about those landmines before you step on them (a missing dependency, a circular dependency, incorrect type) basically asserting \"this code only builds if all the wiring is correct\".",

        "body": "I professionally work on large codebase (~50+ million lines of code) containing a mix of backend and frontend code. We pretty much exclusively use plain-old dependency injection and do not quite use the service locator pattern.\n\nThis is partly due to the architecture of our codebase, which is a monorepo containing a bunch of microservices. That is, we have one giant repo where all code lives, and the code contains several thousand smaller programs that are managed by different teams and deployed independently at cadences picked by the owning team. (The monorepo + microservice approach makes it easier for each team to move independently while still making it easy to share + reuse + mass-refactor code, etc.)\n\nGiven this setup, having a central registry is not hugely useful because:\n\n1. If we create just one 'registry library' that everybody adds their thing to, it ends up introducing a major bottleneck to builds and tests. When we make a code change, our build system + CI pipeline tries building and testing only code that ends up depending on that code change in some way; having a single common module that nearly every microservice takes a dep on would add an unnecessary bottleneck.\n2. You don't really get much benefit out of having every single microservice create their own registry and register deps. If you're going through the hassle of this, you may as well just pass in those dependencies directly into your code and skip setting up the intermediary registry.\n\nBeyond this though, I personally think service locators are inferior to plain-old-code and dependency injection because:\n\n1. Having the dependencies be statically encoded in the source code instead of created dynamically via some magic framework makes it easier for IDEs and static analysis tools to determine where exactly different snippets of code are being used, programmatically update the code, more intelligently pick which tests must be run given certain code changes, perform type checking, etc. So, the less dynamic/runtime wiring we can have, the better.\n2. It also makes unit testing easier -- there's nothing simpler then just calling a plain-old-function or instantiating a plain-old-class. The less ceremony you can have, the better.\n3. Arguably service locators make it a little too easy to add new deps. Code that takes a large number of deps is usually a sign of poorly-designed code -- it should be broken up into smaller, better compartmentalized components. So, having a little bit of friction here seems like a pro, not a con.\n\nAll that said, it's true that these microservices need a way to communicate with each other -- need some sort of [service discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_discovery). This has less to do with code architecture and more to do with the reality that these microservices need to run on a fleet of many thousands of hosts, and so need a way of discovering which IP address any particular microservice replica is serving from at any given time.\n\nTo do this, we have microservices register their IP address in a system that's pretty similar to DNS; downstream microservices need to hard-code the specific service address and perform a lookup to talk to other microservices they take a dep on.\n\nIn fairness, the actual code to do all of the above can end up feeling pretty similar to the service locator pattern in practice -- it's just that instead of registering a pointer, we register IP addresses. So, I suppose we do use a variant of this pattern in practice.\n\n> are multithreaded\n\nI think multi-threadness is irrelevant here. If your code is multi-threaded, your deps need to be thread-safe, no matter how they're passed around.",

Really, really slow. Sometimes this is not a problem. Basic UI, testing, etc. is usually ok being slow. However, when I am a financial firm executing trades on the stock market, I cannot afford for my trade to take 10 seconds to execute. I’m looking for microseconds. Not milliseconds, microseconds. This is physically impossible in Python. \n\nSometimes I need good concurrency and good speed. For example, if I am Wikipedia and am regularly serving over 100,000 requests per second (https://grafana.wikimedia.org/), I need a combination of speed, multithreading, and multiprocessing if I want to avoid spending enormous quantities of money on extra servers.

        "body": "There are a lot of questions in one here, but here's a brief attempt to cover most bases:\n\n* Why not just use Python for everything? Because, even for relatively simple uses, it's inherently pretty slow. It's simple **because** it hides a lot of the detail from you, but that detail is often where optimisation lies. Video games or scientific data analysis tools, for example, are often doing billions of calculations per second; they **need** to be heavily optimised. Python simply doesn't let you.\n* Why could the engineer get away with using Python (apart from the above)? Among other reasons: because he programs a single, small piece of software for one specific device that doesn't need to run anything else. A lot of the difficulty of low-level programming is getting incompatible systems to talk to each other - and you'd be surprised by how many similar-looking systems are incompatible. Does your computer have an x86 processor or an ARM processor? Most people have no clue, but they fundamentally speak two completely different languages. Python's solution to this is to force everything to run inside its interpreter, which solves the problem, but also isn't always what you want, because e.g. you can only run one piece of software inside the interpreter at once. (The home computer I'm writing this on currently has hundreds of processes active all at once.)\n* Are certain programming languages better than others for certain tasks? Yes and no - it depends what \"better\" means. You can achieve more or less anything you want on a computer by programming in C, for example. But if you really need to eke out every last drop of performance, you'll probably have to switch at least part of your code to Assembly. If you prefer to think in an object-oriented way, then programming in C might be very slow for you personally, and you might prefer C++. If you're paranoid about memory safety or whatever, then you might inherently distrust C and become a Rust bro. If your project is simple, and you're not actually worried about performance or portability at all, but it's large, then you might want to pick something simple to code in like Python to minimise developer time. If you want to make use of community-maintained libraries for working with large datasets or whatever, you might find that C doesn't quite do what you want, and writing it yourself from scratch would take months, so you just pick the thing that already exists in R. If you're working on decades-old financial software, then you might find your entire million-line codebase is in COBOL, and while it's technically **possible** to rewrite it in C, a subtle mistake might cost billions of dollars and crash the economy and send the whole country after you with pitchforks, so it's probably wiser just to learn COBOL.",

Very little hand holding but because you have to do so much work, including your own memory & stack memory management, you can write very small and very fast pieces of code.\n\nSQL was designed to work with databases.\n\nPERL was designed to work with text.

So we got them to do the work they needed and export to csv. We then did the same thing on the new system and also exported. Then we compared results. \n\nFor the first few compares we used Excel. We built some template workbooks and a simple importer. This was the perfect solution, as users could see the date and easily track down bad results. \n\nWe moved to larger datasets, and obviously Excel started to struggle, but we also knew the data pretty well, and knew from users what to look for.  \n\nWe switched to a compare written in python with pandas.  This was the perfect solution, we could run multigig csv compares faster than Excel could import one of the CSVs, users knew our process, so we could just send them the reduced outputs, and we could customise the scripts per compare, and still churn through them quickly. \n\n\nThen we moved on to aggregate data. TB to PB of data. We had c++ code written to do in place compares. This was the perfect solution. We didn’t need to do export/import shenanigans any more, the code was pretty static, and we didn’t need to see intermediate data. \n\nEach of these was literally the perfect solution for what appears to be the same task across three iterations. But in each iteration the tool chosen was so much better than the other two approaches it was obvious what to use. Different tools really shine for different tasks. We could have used one tool for all three iterations, any of the three tools we chose. But for the wrong phase each tool would have increased our time and pain levels exponentially.",

You can still ask AI questions about code, similar to how you may ask Reddit or Stack overflow, but don't let it do the code for you if possible.\n\nI know that is an extremely broad answer and not the specific one you want, but it's the answer you will end up following no matter what you do if you want to keep being a programmer.\n\nSeeing that you have 2 months experience and seemed to have relied on \"Vibe Coding\", I would just assume you know little to nothing about programming. This isn't to insult you, but it's probably a fairly accurate description of where you are.\n\nYou've taken the first steps to learning, which is great! However, like anything else in life, it will take you time to learn how to actually program. I don't know what you are working on specifically so I'm not sure how good of advice I can give, but the two sources I could recommend are:\n\nY. Daniel Liang's Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures: This is basically the book my school taught from for a lot of it's courses, and I think it does a pretty good job. Others would have to give their thoughts on it however. Also, you would need to buy it.\n\nThe Odin Project; TOP teaches front end development first, think website pages, and transitions to more back end stuff later on. I have only completed their first course so I don't know what comes after, but it does a good job of teaching the concepts. This one is free and at your own pace, so it can be flexible around your schedule.\n\n(Also there is a course called CS50 from some school that is said to be good for learning introductory programming which is free. I haven't taken it, but lots of people recommend it.)\n\nThe last piece of advice I can give is that you speak honestly with whoever your boss is and try to get a programming mentor at the company. They will be able to teach you hands on, and will probably be the closest thing to an actual teacher you can get.\n\nRemember, avoid using any AI to code for you or directly show the solution to problems you are having, but you can still use it to ask about concepts and ideas. If you get exceptionally stuck, you can ask it for a solution (people ask for solutions on the internet in other places like Stack overflow, so it isn't absolutely wrong to do so) but try to make sure you've done just about everything you can to solve it by yourself first.",

Mathematically, it's proof by induction: you're really writing a set of rules which in combination will force a result into existence.\n\nBut it's also executed in a very low-level, very mechanical way by whatever language you are using. Add some prints and watch EXACTLY what happens as your function executes.\n\nThe trick is to see both these views at the same time. Programming is all about writing a specification which when executed will compute the result you want.\n\nTheoretically, these two views are denotational and operational semantics, if you want read more.",

Just ignore all the maths on that page unless you really want to get into discrete maths - the pictures are enough to get an idea.\n\nBoth of these turn out to relate to the difference between stacks and queues (LIFO and FIFO lists): breadth-first search works like iteration with a queue, and depth-first search works like recursion, with a stack.\n\nThat's all fairly woolly, but the point is that these things are all related, understanding one will make the others easier, and learning the relationships will help to cement that understanding.",

        "body": "The whole industry has been feeding on its own grift for a while now.\n\nEver tried explaining SCRUM to someone who doesn't work in tech? They'll look at you like you take the short bus to the office.\n\nThe average software engineer now applies to over 400 job postings for every interview. And many of those interviews are what, 6 rounds? No other industry comes close to that. And it's not an imbalance of supply and demand. It's a hiring practices problem.\n\nDon't even get me start on leetcode. Yes, I know it's supposed to weed out the fakers so the company doesn't end up with a bunch of devs who can't code their way out of a paper bag. And yet those same companies still end up developing massive piles of overcomplicated crapware. Almost like the devs aren't the bottleneck. Also, senior devs can spot the fakers a mile away.\n\nAnd now with the vibe coding. I'm seriously considering starting a new service that just fixes the messes people make with their vibe coded apps. I bet I'd make bank by advertising it with a bunch of LinkedIn posts saying how the service will \"take their vibe code to the next level\". Cannot wait for that bubble to burst.\n\nThing is, it wasn't like this even 10 years ago. These are all problems the tech industry has created for itself.\n\nNow for the fun part. To people outside the industry, your skills are like magic. And it's not even the complicated CS stuff.\n\nDo you have any idea how many small businesses out there are paying marketing agencies to do SEO for them, yet they don't even have access to their own traffic data? And the agencies make up excuses because really they're just Wordpress shops that can't get their tracking pixels hooked up to Salesforce correctly so the data is useless and they can't say that part out loud.\n\nThe reason so many people are talking about AI (aside from the grifters and enterprise salespeople) is because they want to be able to do the things you can do. They want their tech to work the way they think it should, yet every time they talk to a dev shop about it they end up talking about nonsense like user stories and sprint timelines.\n\nIt took me way too many years to figure this out. The kicker was when I was working as consultant and somehow ended up on a small side project that was basically setting up a SquareSpace site for a local business. Our sales guy managed to bill it out at $150/hour. For a SquareSpace site. My techie brain thought this was a drastic overcharge because I thought the whole point of SquareSpace was that you didn't have to hire someone to do it for you. But for that local business that sold old muscle car parts, SquareSpace was over their head and it was worth $150/hour to have me do it for them.\n\nEventually I got fed up building the umpteenth enterprise iOS app so I quit working with companies that do anything enterprise-y at all. It's too soul sucking.\n\nAnd you know what? Turns out it's not so hard to sell my skills to non-tech companies. What I think is easy is what they think is magic. That's a win-win.\n\nThey don't buy unit tests (not that I want to write them), but they're game for anything that helps their sales funnel.\n\nMy advice for anyone burning out in the tech industry is this. You probably see your skills and dedication to quality as an investment for a company. They probably see you as a cost center. So next time you get stressed by the nonsense, start thinking about how to apply what you know in ways that would help non-tech companies. Think outside the box. Then do the hard part and reach out to a few of them. You might be surprised at what you learn and end up with a whole new perspective on how all this really works.\n\nIf nothing else, the experience will certainly help you write better Upwork proposals.",

To quickly lookup syntax, or simple things that nobody memorizes?\n\nOr are they going to let them prompt engineer the entire answer to the problem?\n\nBecause if it's the former, that already happens today.... except it's not AI. It's asking your interviewer. In my experience, interviewers don't care if you have some dumb syntax memorized, they don't care if you stumble on how to do X in Y language. Those things don't matter on the job, and they don't matter in the interview. It's the problem solving they care about. Usually interviewers make it clear you can ask them syntax questions like that, or other nudges AI-as-a-tool would normally help you with. I've also been in interviews where they're totally fine with you googling, you just have to let them know you're doing that before you do it.\n\nIf it's the latter though, good fucking luck. I don't know about you, but I always dreaded open-book tests/exams in college. Because they were always made difficult enough to *warrant* them being open book. They were *harder* then closed book exams. If you're vibe coding and prompt engineering your way through an interview, you can expect that interview to be written with the expectation that you're vibing through it at lightning speed, and it'd be unachievable if you didn't.",

Including here.  **This sub has learned nothing from history.**\n\nWhen oil prices are high relative to extraction costs for extended periods of time, petroleum engineering ranks SWELL.  When prices sit at commodity levels above extraction costs, petroleum engineering ranks dwindle fast within 2 years.  The median petroleum engineering graduate becomes UNEMPLOYED.\n\nIn the boom times in the 21st century, petroleum engineering grads were walking out of school to 20 offers in the 195k-225k range with a large bonus potential.  They'd go bust their ass many many hours a week out in some rustic environment somewhere.  There was all kinds of \"what should I specialize in\" conversations like should I do wireline, or logging, or MWD, or be reservoir side, or whatever.\n\nAnd then POOF.  Prices fall... extraction costs rise, and that project you were paying the PE 225k to babysit no longer makes money and STOPS.  STOPS.\n\nPetroleum engineering had 2600 +/- BS grads (and don't forget several hundred MS students too) in 2017.  Less than 600 now, and what looks to be about 600 in 2024.  7 years to fall.  Using the broad numbers you posted, this is like the 100,000 CS grads in 2025 becoming 23,000 by 2032.\n\n**Does this REALLY make petroleum engineering look attractive to you?**  A major that's seen 80% drop in enrollment in 7 years because the industry cannot support its graduates?\n\n> With the massive datacenter boom, this is pretty hot right now.\n\nDatacenters employ so few people once built; you can build 100 more of them, and they're still a minor player.  Design of datacenters is mostly electrical, mechanical, and structural engineering, there might be ONE or TWO IE on a major datacenter design project.  Hell there's going to be more architects than IE's.  If you want to WORK in a datacenter, good luck.  If you want to DESIGN datacenters, electrical, mechanical, or structural.  I literally work for a company that does MANY data centers for companies we've all heard of, and I am a chemical engineer.  I LITERALLY WORK HERE, and for $1,000,000 I couldn't get on a data center project.  Mechanical, electrical, structural, and architects, or GTFO.\n\n> These engineering fields: Nuclear, naval...\n\nGAH... horrible.  Do not study nuclear engineering.  You do NOT do what you think you do.  The nuclear side of the nuclear world is a solved issue and even a large new nuke plant requires very few nuclear engineers.  I do firmly feel that there will be a nuclear renaissance in this country as people figure out that nuclear power is safe and can help with a lot of power issues in this countries, I am very excited for this, and actually personally would love to get in on the action given I live close to one of the major SMR players main office.\n\nHOWEVER, in a new nuke plant... the majority of engineering design hours will be spent by mechanical engineers, structural engineers (which come out of civil), electrical engineers.  If you want to work in that industry, THOSE are target paths.",

A really successful small firm could die in a month if they were to lose two contracts back-to-back. For the huge companies, any sign of work slowing will often result in teams being let go. They're usually done silently, but in this case it's likely to be more noteworthy because layoffs and offshoring are popular right now. From a business perspective it's good, because it makes you look efficient. After all, if everyone else is doing it, it's fine, right...\n\nIt's also worth noting that in contracting firms, a LOT of people might be classed as technical/service staff when their job is essentially a PM or AM role, basically tracking work, making sure the client is happy, etc.\n\nFinally, this is my own personal perspective on contracting, but the idea that a contracting firm will have any advancements in AI is utterly laughable. It's not even a skill issue, but one where work will need to be billed to a client, and there's no fucking way that TCS is billing someone for the time taken to mess around with AI issues. Contracting firms often believe that they're at the forefront of technology, but my experience of subcontracting for TCS was arguing with a PM because I had written unit tests and they viewed it as \"unnecessary work we will not pay for\". When I pushed back, their response was \"well, it should work first time\". It's an environment of shortcuts, and while they probably love the idea of AI doing dev work, it'll end in tears without any shadow of a doubt.",

Whatever process we used to use, you can call it Waterfall or something else, GANTT chart based projects… they had a very different progression.\n\nYou’d have long periods in the beginning of a project where you’d read and write documentation, do planning, research, exploratory code. Then things would ramp up, and you’d start getting the real work done. Towards the end of the project, the deadline would loom, and the real problems would start to appear.\n\nYou’d enter “crunch mode”, which truly sucked, deeply sucked horribly. This could go on for a month or two. Eventually you’d launch and settle back into the beginning phase of a new project. This was a HUGE relief. Then you’d do it all over again.\n\nSounds bad? Well enter Agile which aimed to solve these problems, supposedly. How? By turning everything into a constant drip of 2 week sprints. Every sprint is a deadline. It’s all a micro version of the old way, you never get into the massive crunch time (maybe), instead you trade it for a constant, unrelenting stress. It never lets up, not for a second - and you spend your entire career this way.\n\nIt’s far worse.",

The reality is deadlines, short term trade offs made by C Suite and never the opportunity to address tech debt. They care launching something to take credit, get paid or paid to leave. There’s always constant churn, throwing blame, escalations, and pip culture. That’s why the more senior you get the more you care less, you’re numb to it all and look forward to getting pipped.",

Try to find a niche that you can learn more about than anyone else. Is there a part of your job processes that feels like toil, or takes a long time, or nobody seems to fully understand? Spend some time trying to improve that thing. Research alternative tools, try to write documentation (the kind you wish were there for you right now), see if you can reverse engineer it.\n\n\nYou will probably get stuck early on, or feel like you're missing some fundamentals, but that's okay. Ask questions when you can, and keep chipping away at it. Eventually, when you have something that you think is an improvement over what's there (probably won't be all that hard to get to that point to be honest) you can let it be known that you've created a new resource or process, and get some people to review it. Chances are good you'll end up being a go-to person for that thing in the future. You'll have very experienced devs coming to you for help/advice/best practices in that domain.\n\n\nFrom there you'll probably incidentally pick up a lot through the process. You'll recognize things in the codebase as being in some ways similar to the thing you took ownership of. You'll get a request to integrate your thing with some other unfamiliar thing, and then you repeat the process until you understand that thing really well too.\n\n\nBit by bit, you'll start feeling pretty confident. \n\n\nSource: my own experience, feeling like a bad developer for many years and then having my confidence grow as a contributor once I figured out this mindset",

In a lot of organisations, if you don't spend your budget, the budget will be reduced next year, so there is no incentive to save money.\n\nI would never defend anything Elon Musk does, but the fact is he reduced headcount at Twitter by over half, and it's still functioning, it turns out over half the people there didn't really need to be.\n\nI'm not saying this is good or bad, but the fact is most large companies employ far people people that they realistically need.\n\nI think if all companies ran efficiently, or at least tried to, there would probably be 50% unemployment, so it's not like it's necessarily terrible that companies employ more people than they need.",

The only companies I see doing anything really new, interesting or truly greenfield are startups. They either last a year or two before closing up shop, or getting bought out by bigger organisations who immediately shed any staff who weren't absolutely intrinsic to the synergy of product lines.

It's entirely possible that your read of him being insecure is accurate -- filling someone else's shoes in a lead position can be very difficult, especially if the previous senior was handling certain aspects of development (deployments being a common one) to allow more junior members of the team to focus on tasks that fit their existing skillsets. It's good to keep in mind that different people have different backgrounds, learn things at different speeds, and may have different responsibilities and priorities that limit their capacity to pick up skills that you think should be a pre-requisite. \n\nIt's not possible for Reddit to tell, since we don't know your shop or the team dynamic or anything else, but you may in fact be 100% on point that his skills aren't where they should be. You may also be accurate that his attitude towards you is causing some of the problems. Based on the examples you've provided I wouldn't say I'm convinced, personally, but it's possible (maybe even likely?) that there are some gaps in both technical and management skills that come from being promoted up to a position where he's in a bit over his head.  \n  \nI'd highly recommend doing some self-assessment on your attitude towards the job. It's not unreasonable to be frustrated if you feel your teammate is not reliable when it comes to handing off responsibilities, but it doesn't sound at all like you're interested in actually helping elevate him, your team, or your team's output. If you think there are things he should know then maybe you will have to do some of the teaching yourself, and it will make things a lot better for the both of you if you do so with an attitude of \"I want to help our team improve\" instead of \"I always say \"we\" in front of him and the team\" when addressing things you see as issues. You're not really beating the charges of \"know-it-all junior\" when you make snide replies and add passive-aggressive edits to the OP after not getting the response you wanted here.

As engineers we do tend to forget that a team is a coop game and we need to work together and there’s enough recognition to be passed around.

When you work on a team, there’s a division of labor. Very rarely will you get someone that knows every single aspect of what the team does. \n\nI was just like you when I started my career. Came in years ago, thought everyone above me was an idiot because they couldn’t do the things that I thought were very simple and easy to me. However, they were also VERY good at things I never even knew existed and were important. I think recognizing that we are all good at different things and can divide and conquer was a large step in me being able to respect my teammates and in me being able to step up after a few years to eventually lead them. \n\nAll this to say, don’t be so quick to write off your coworkers. I think the amount of people that get promoted unfairly is understated/overstated at the same time. Do many people not deserve the title of “senior” or beyond? Yes. But it is also equally true that these people get put in these positions because they fill a need. \n\nNot everyone who doesn’t match your standards of technical skills and viewpoints is incompetent. They may even be great at things you suck at or don’t even know exist. I highly doubt that you know EVERYTHING about software engineering in a professional organization, at least not yet. I am genuinely giving you advice because this resonated with a younger version of me who thought similar things about my own coworkers. You need to be open-minded, self-reflect, and give props where you can, because these people are probably from different backgrounds and good at different things. Also you have stakes in maintaining a good relationship with coworkers, you will see your coworkers constantly and your relationship with them may determine your career trajectory. Good luck OP",

It's also going to be a lot of messing around with UIs, Salesforce is not exactly a developer first platform, it's very much a management / business people first platform.\n\n\nSo yeah it's probably a pigeon hole, but it's a very high paying pigeon hole",

In many ways I would say it is similar to mainframe. Those industries that still run mainframes really need developers who know what they're doing on mainframe.

Build a system of marketing yourself for example sending 10 job applications a week. Whether you do it yourself or pay someone else to send the job applications, having other job options would keep you secure. If you have more time, learn another skill that you can make a craft or \"retirement job.\" Personally, I trained weightlifting and martial arts and while it's my hobby now, I see myself maybe teaching this when I get older. I also explore digital marketing in the form of blogs, email, social media and video, so I could technically start a business or digital marketing agency or consultant if push comes to shove. Once you're comfortable, try your hand selling something based on your expetise so you have a test business. Your therapist, according to your comment responses is saying \"your feelings are valid\" and I'm reading it as since it's valid, your brain is probably detecing signs that you're going to actually become destitute. There are signs and writing on the wall that's why you're screaming internally and theres something you need to do about it. And I think you need to take it seriosuly. Be around people solving the problem. Be around people in higher positions within your career track. Be around people who are more successful and ask for their advice. Then do something. My suggestions are just examples. As I've had that thought since I entered the marketplace.",

I always meet my (vague) deadlines but everyone around me can see me spend days, often weeks not typing a single letter or staring at my phone.\n\n> And it’s because my work is dull, vague and I am terrified of getting something else. I can get no references, everyone probably hates me and I have no other skills than being mediocre at coding.\n\nI can relate as I have the same fear. I think this is a healthy fear that one should directly address. My advice is to reduce costs and save so that you can live off of a decade from your savings if you lose your job. Work on your technical skills, interview constantly and get job offers so that you always have other options if you get laid off.\n\n> Everyone keeps harping about trades or jobs involving interacting with people and I am bad at both.\n\nI would stick to CS.\n\n> I am in terrible shape, am on the spectrum but not enough for psychologists to care about it, so I am basically someone who has no friends and no relationships in his late 30s. Should I through myself off a bridge?\n\nThis is a separate mental health issue. Get in shape. Work on getting a relationship. Talk to a therapist or read a self-help book.

They want to know that you are interested in their company (show your research) and tell them what you have been working on and learning. Keep your github profile public and show your repositories they want to see you are doing something.\n\nAnother thing that helped was looking at some leetcode easy questions, Iearned some very simple yet important patterns that they didn't teach me at uni and I am usually able to solve the pair programming coding interview parts.

        "body": "50-70 applications per day seems like not a lot of bang for your buck. I'd focus in more on specific roles using specific skillsets, then have templated, tailored resumes for those roles. Right now, your resume seems a little scattershot. As an example of what I mean, in your language skills section you have Java listed first, which tells me you'd be most comfortable in Java, but none of your projects or experience mention Java anywhere, so I don't have much to go off of regarding how skilled you actually are in Java other than current coursework from mthree, which doesn't tell me much.\n\nI was in a similar boat as a new grad, and it took me 10 months to get a job (2 months after graduating). I would have 2-3 resume's with the same or similar information, just re-ordered to fit the job description. Is the job a front-end position using React and TypeScript? You better believe I'm putting that first on the resume. If the job is enterprise Java, then Java, Spring, JUnit are all going to bubble up to the top. Normally I'd suggest having a cover letter too, but it just so happened that all my callbacks came from applications with no cover letter, so your mileage may vary. Last thing I will absolutely recommend is to **bold** the **relevant skills** in your **experience** and **personal projects**. So things like **TypeScript, Tailwind, etc.** should be bolded. HR people don't have a lot of time to sift through applications, so the easier you make it for them to find the technologies they need to see the better. Don't go too crazy with it though. If around 15% of the text in your bullet points are bolded, I'd say that's good.\n\n  \nThat's just the path I took though, there's other ways to go about this. My job hunt was from November 2024 to this month and took about 300 applications sent total , but I got the best results most recently when I was only sending 2-3 applications out per day to places I was 100% sure wanted new grads with little to no experience. I'd also like to know what your application-to-interview ratio is. For me and the people around me, it was normal to get 1 interview for every 50 applications or so. If you're not hitting that (or anywhere close to that I'm guessing) then you might be applying to places too liberally. That's all I've got! Good luck, going that long without a job is rough.\n\n  \nP.S. if your personal projects fall on the gaps in your employment, it might be worth putting the timeframes you worked on the projects. That way it would at least show you're doing something between your internship and mthree, but idk how effective that would be.",

Recruiters with even less technical experience and patience, might glaze over it or hit the reject button when looking for buzzwords. I'd either try to simplify the language or concepts of what you actually delivered or just tailor this section to specific types of jobs (like how in these projects you used Python etc. to deliver).\n\n\\- Probably remove the EE degree in progress as it's not really relevant or use it in your EE-only resume.\n\n\\- The undergrad teaching assistant role sounds like fluff, and no employer really cares about how many assignments you graded etc. you should probably write something along the lines of what you taught and areas of focus you excelled at teaching like red-black trees or something etc. Or try and take a look at other undergraduate TAs on Linkedin or something and see what they wrote. To me, at least it seems very \"I want a TA job.\"\n\nLast point is you probably want to tailor your resume to each of those roles you listed that you're applying for. At best this looks close to an \"EE major that used to be CS looking for an internship/jr role\" to me, but has some mixed signals so you'd want to orient the resume better towards those kinds of jobs if so.",

She didn’t get many interviews, and the ones she did get early on didn’t go too well. But she kept grinding LeetCode and prepping.

You can and should get involved in research because that’s such a low bar to get involved in and will immediately add experience to resume and will be a good bonus if you get published and graduate level internships will like this. \n\nThere is a lot of good paying science based computer science jobs (especially in defense since you are domestic) that will see that as a big plus.

Either way, they have zero understanding of what they're asking you to do.\n\nThe red flags are everywhere: contract misrepresentation, title bait-and-switch, absent management, conflicting directives, and now performance criticism based on fantasy benchmarks. You've already delivered a 75% efficiency improvement in three months, which proves your competence despite their dysfunction.\n\nA service like Applyre might be helpful for finding actual development roles where technical decisions are made by people who understand technology. This law firm treating you like a code monkey while expecting miracles is not normal.\n\n3 months at a toxic workplace won't hurt your resume, especially in tech where short stints are common. Frame it as \"seeking a role focused on software development rather than mixed responsibilities\" and emphasize the automation project you delivered. Most hiring managers understand that some companies are disasters and respect candidates who recognize bad situations quickly rather than suffering through years of dysfunction.",

Honestly, take it with a grain of salt. Most of the loudest voices predicting the \"end of software engineering\" aren’t engineers themselves and are often coming from a business lens where disruption = fear. But if you’re in engineering, you can already see what’s really happening. AI is changing the way engineers work, not eliminating the need for them. Sure, some lower-level tasks are getting automated, but that just means the bar is shifting toward people who understand AI systems, prompt engineering, model integration, performance tuning, security, ethics, etc. You’re positioning yourself exactly in that space.\n\nAlso, the fact that your new role is in AI software engineering? That’s one of the most resilient and high-impact areas to be in right now. There’s still a massive shortage of engineers who can build, scale, and fine-tune AI products responsibly.",

The biggest mistake would be positioning yourself as a career changer when you're actually a seasoned developer expanding your skill set. Your deep understanding of how applications work from the client side gives you a massive advantage in backend development because you understand the full picture of how data flows and what the frontend actually needs. Companies should see you as someone who can build APIs that actually make sense for the consuming applications, not just someone learning Java from scratch.\n\nThe interview struggle you're facing is real and frustrating, but there are ways around the traditional leetcode gauntlet. Target smaller companies and startups where you can often get in front of actual engineering managers who care more about your ability to solve real problems than your ability to reverse a binary tree under pressure. Focus on companies that do practical coding exercises or take-home projects instead of whiteboard sessions. Your strength in systems design and high-level thinking is incredibly valuable, especially for backend roles where understanding architecture matters more than memorizing algorithms. Some companies do hire based on these skills alone, particularly in more senior positions where they expect you to learn the specific technical details on the job.\n\nI actually work on [AI interview helper](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to showcase your transferable skills and handle technical questions that might be outside your current wheelhouse.",

In hindsight it was a good option because if worse comes to worse I can pivot from SWE to EE or CE. Perhaps I would be more competitive in SWE jobs with an SWE degree, but an EE degree is still very prestigious as it was the default for programmers up until the late 90s or perhaps even early 2000s. For example the CEO of Microsoft has an EE bachelors. The CEO of Google did his Bachelors in Metallurgy and Masters and Materials Engineering.\n\nI would definitely do something engineering though. CS is less challenging (4 courses vs 6 in engineering), more saturated and offers less flexibility. And even if AI does automate most human labor, licensed Engineers still have state granted authority to sign off on safety critical projects (this matters more in an age with powerful AI, because powerful means dangerous). The reason engineers are sometimes grouped with doctors, lawyers etc. is because they all need to go through stringent licensing and all have serious legal considerations when they sign off on something. Getting a degree that enables you a path to such a license would be extremely valuable, and CS won't give you that option.",

But my advice as someone with a few career regrets would be this:\n\n1) Only go to college if you feel ready to give school your full attention. It is relatively easy to fuck around for 4 years and walk out with a degree. But if you limp your way through a STEM degree without fully internalizing the content and setting aside time for relevant clubs and student associations, you're not getting much more than debt out of school.\n\nThere are plenty of things you can do in the mean-time if you want to focus on being young for a little while.\n\n2) Only go into a major you actually have some passion for. Engineering is a lifelong grind. You need to always be learning new things, taking classes, and skilling up. A lot of people in software burn out or decay because it's too draining to grind something you hate.\n\n3) The most important thing your college gives you access to is not the degree. It is professional work experience through internships and co-ops. Your entire college career should be centered around securing as much work experience as possible as early as possible. A college degree without at least 9 months of work experience is borderline worthless.",

If im in the ball park and my explanation as to why I got there is correct, i've impressed the interviewer. There's def been times I didnt get the answer but I also realized my mistake or didnt and said \"my next idea would be to do XYZ since this didnt work\". \n\nFor me all 3 are just as important but the more Jr you are the more the coding interview should matter. The more Senior you are the more leadership and system design should matter. Because as a Jr it's important to know how to code and learn system design within the company, as a principal it's more important to know design/leadership over code. Seniors and mid-level need to know more about leadership/system design than Jrs but less than principals. \n\nSo for percentages id say:\n\nJrs - 80% coding, 15% System, 5% leader\n\nMid-level - 65% coding 25% system, 10% leader\n\nSenior - 40% coding 30% system, 30% leader\n\nPrincipal - 20% coding, 40% system, 40% leader\n\nThe higher you go in this career the less you code so for a principal coding shouldnt be important because at that point it's assumed you already know.",

It does help to make your resume look a bit nicer and might get you a slightly higher role and pay off the bat, but to me it's not worth 2 years of missing out on experience to do for an extra 5k-10k in pay you would've just likely had if you started to work. The key really is if you can get a job to pay for your masters degree. So in summary, it's not worth the MSCS unless you get someone to pay it for you or if you can escape paying minimal and not having to get loans. I had my job pay it for me and I grinded for 2 years as a part-time student and only had to pay 5k out of pocket those 2 years. But I also did summer courses as well to finish on time. \n\nAs for your leetcode grind. I am not someone who really thinks you need to \"grind\" leetcode to get a job. You can and might be good at it to land the job, the problem is that many people think they can just grind it and dont care to learn the ins and outs of what they are doing. So they basically are hoping to get a similar question where they can think \"omg that's leetcode question #100 or similar to it, i just need a map\". But they dont care to learn why they need the map, or if there's a slightly different approach they could take. I have been in the job market twice in my career, never had to grind leetcode and I got into two big tech companies (one of them a Mag7 company) by just following a google DSA guide I will link below. It has videos from cracking the coding interview author that explain DSA very well. Also links free leetcode study guides with example questions to practice on. \n\nCompanies dont care if you get the questions right, they only care if you know what you are doing and explain your thought process well in the questions. I got both those jobs and didnt do 100% well on the questions. A few times I got stuck but because I explained my thought process well they liked my approach. They know you wont get it 100% off the bat, they just want to know where your heads at. So for me i like to say \"hey i think I can possibly use a map here because of XYZ possibly a set\" and then I try it. I also go step by step. So usually the first thing I tackle is the return cases. I.e. if I am doing a array traversal the first thing I write is the return case if array is empty. It sounds dumb, but they appreciate when you tackle the small things first that could easily be forgotten. Also it's one of those things of once you start coding your nerves go down even if it's a simple lin. \n\nThen at the end I write test cases and try to go through multiple different cases (empty array, edge cases, etc). If any of them come out wrong, then I quickly refactor.\n\nGoogle DSA link is: [https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)",

Most tech companies care way more about your ability to solve coding problems and demonstrate practical skills than they do about advanced degrees. A master's degree might open some doors at research-heavy companies or for certain specialized roles, but for the majority of software engineering positions, you're better off investing that time and money into sharpening your interview skills and building a portfolio that shows you can actually code.\n\nThat said, the interview grind is real and can be soul-crushing if you're not strategic about it. Focus on understanding patterns rather than memorizing solutions, and make sure your projects actually solve problems or demonstrate technologies that companies use. The market is tough right now, but candidates who can confidently navigate technical interviews still get offers.

You want to have already interviewed with other companies to get those nerves out the way and get an idea of what you can fix for the next interview. \n\nSo again, a phone interivew is usually just the recuriter asking you what you do and to give brief descriuptions so he can send it to the hiring manager. It wont guarantee interviews at all, just that you are in the system. If you get interviews, I say take them and expect nothing from them. If you get it and you feel it's a better opportunity than you cross that bridge if you get there.",

With today's market, you got to be pretty competitive (4-5 years ago, you had a better chance of \"getting lucky\"). Working full-time is a pain, and even putting just 10 hours a week into transitioning into SWE can be hard. All-in-all, I wouldn't be surprised if it took you over a year to line up your first job.\n\nI will say though, as a self taught dev with no degree, you got some strengths here: You have a CS degree and you've been working a job that will generally look respectable on a resume. I do think you have a pretty healthy shot at transitioning into SWE, but the market is bad and it's pretty rough out there.\n\nI'll assume you have some rough experience with programming (how to reasonably use classes, functions, if statements, for loops), or at the very least, all that will come back to you pretty quickly.\n\nIf you want to get into fullstack, I would start off by focusing on Java / Springboot for backend, JavaScript / React for frontend, and use Git. I would ***probably*** recommend taking a Udemy course (I never personally tried Udemy, but I often hear good things) for both React and Springboot. You can just watch a YouTube tutorial for Git. Try to get to a point where you can work on a project pretty consistently. Just have one project you're pretty committed to.\n\nAfter that, there's interview prep. Go through the roadmap on https://neetcode.io (mainly focus on the video explanations, don't waste a ton of time trying to solve questions yourself at this stage). After the roadmap, do some random questions LeetCode, and try to get to a spot where you have like an 80% chance of solving an unfamiliar medium-level problem in under 60 minutes (if you haven't solved it after 2 hours, just look up the answer and try to think where you went wrong).\n\nMore than anything else though ***talk through the problems***. You wanna be good at \"solving\" problems because sometimes you get \"assessments\" (basically you have to solve a LeetCode problem before getting to interview anybody), but for \"interviews\" you need to be good at talking technical. You should look up \"mock coding interviews\" on YouTube interviews to see what mean here.\n\nYou should start applying before you're 100% confident with anything though (you're never going to be 100% ready to start applying). In fact, I would honestly recommend you just start sending out like 3 applications a week ***right now***. Just half ass it, get it out of the way, and get used to it. Don't waste too much time \"waiting to feel ready\" (I wasted a lot of time on this back in 2021).\n\nFor your resume, skim through the wiki on r/EngineeringResumes. You'll have to adjust a bit though because of your background, but do what you can to leverage your current work experience (be detailed), and mainly try to sell yourself as \"an important team member that holds some key responsibilities and/or accomplishments\". I know that can be really awkward, but again, I think you got quite a respectable role.\n\nAnd finally, as far as applying goes, apply to any role that looks reasonably relevant, doesn't look too \"specialized\", and asks for less than 5 years of experience. Don't be too picky, just focus on playing the numbers game more than anything else.",

Python, SQL (start writing your own soon!), Power BI/Tableau are great tools, and healthcare companies are constantly hiring analysts who can work with lab or patient data. Bonus: you can build portfolio projects using synthetic healthcare datasets to show immediate relevance.\n\nThat said, if you’re more drawn to building things end-to-end, **full-stack with Java + JS** is solid—but it’ll take longer to ramp up, especially if your coding muscles are rusty. One middle path: try backend-focused roles or automation scripting in Python to bridge between the two.\n\nYou don’t need to “catch up” on everything just pick a direction, build 2–3 focused projects, and you’ll have a strong story. Feel free to ask if you’d like free beginner-friendly project ideas or a platform where you can find study buddies to stay consistent.",

Maybe I'm taking the wrong courses. \n\nBut yeah, I just started learning Java with Spring Boot tonight. Decided to do a common project (Making a Letterboxd \"clone\") , but rather than watch a video tutorial, I'm using chatGPT to learn. At first, it's been giving me a bunch of code snippets to paste and I'm going through with that to learn the process in how to make a project from start to finish with a backend and frontend, but I think moving forward, I'll ask it to give me less code snippets and more just explain concepts and theories with examples without the code directly related to the project I'm working on. \n\nPerhaps I'll try to get the fundamentals down again, maybe make a solid project or two (Nothing too crazy) and then start applying within the next week or two. Thanks for being encouraging about my chances. I'll try to leverage my science/healthcare background and maybe look for more niche roles in the biopharmaceutical industry related to tech/SWE. Obviously, they won't pay as big as tech or finance companies, but I'm just trying to learn and get my foot in the door ASAP to gain more relevant experience. Thanks again for the advice :)",

I dont mind talking to him but I felt it may be best to bring it up to you so to avoid the wrong approach.\" Something like that.\n\nUnfortunately in this career there are always hostile devs. Some you can learn to co-exist with them, others it's impossible. I've worked with 2 guys like that. First guy, was a screamer. His way or the high-way. I was terrified of hij when I first go tthere. Then I had to work with him. Funny thing was, he ended up being the nicest guy. I learned how to work with him basically. I noticed that if I had a difference of opinion I had to back up my words. Most of the time I was still wrong lol, but sometimes I was right and he gave me credit. I think he liked that I did my own investiagation and even had my own points. I wasnt just taking his word as the god given truth. \n\nNow in my second job, I could never figure out the hostile dev. He had no people skills that I could crack. In a lot of ways I compare him to Michael Jordan. He was the guy that knew everything of the project. He produced in his sleep. He didnt mind working 12 hour days. He told managers how to do their job. I fhe didnt like your work ethic, he didnt want to work with you. And I think he realzied early on he didnt like my work ethic (Im more of a9-5 guy). I worked with him on a major project he had created and it went terribly. I kept finding erors and had to change my design like 20 times because each time I came up with a design, another problem would come up. Then he gave my manager a list of his complaints of me. My manager kind of walked on eggshells for him tbh. I will admit some was fair, but others just seemed unfair. The biggest one I remember that I felt was unfair was that my manager said that I have too many commits in my MRs. That happened once and it was because the design changed so much. I fought it but my manager even 6 months later was still using that against me. I ended up getting fired. I dont blame that dev but it defintelty felt like the beginning of the end when I wasnt on his good side.",

Sometimes they are completely clueless people that don’t understand that using a wide audience chat is not how you deal with things.\n\nSo, we’ve fixed this a few ways. \n\nFirst step is to document every single time they call you out on a wide audience chat of any kind. If this person does this to others, probably should document that as well. The more records you have the better. Screenshots are also preferred.\n\nSecond step is to let your manager know that you don’t appreciate being put on blast by this other dev in a company wide chat especially when they you’re not at fault for the issue. Include your record of every time they  call you out specifically and what the actual issue was that had to be resolved. Ask your manager how this should be handled. The wrong answer is “nothing”. We had to do a meeting where all the devs agreed to not individually name people even in our team only chat for issues. Senior Devs can ping people directly and handle it not in a chat.\n\nThird step is if this behavior continues and your management doesn’t do anything, notify HR with your documentation. Make sure you have save this documentation somewhere you have access to in case they retaliate (manager, HR, senior dev).\n\nOn most of my teams, we never had to get past step 2. Only once did we have someone get to step 3 and HR talked to the offending dev and manager. Behavior stopped for a few months and then started up again. In that case, the guy was gone in like 48 hours after he started again because he started blaming people who weren’t on our team or didn’t work on the project with issues.",

If you hear about someone working on cloud migrations, network configurations, or server maintenance, ask if you can shadow, help, or at least learn what tools they’re using. You’d be surprised how much access and insight you can get just by showing curiosity and initiative. Outside of work, keep building your skills around cloud fundamentals. Since you're studying cloud computing, start applying what you're learning in small personal projects. Spin up a website using S3 and CloudFront, automate infrastructure with Terraform, or play around with IAM policies in a sandbox AWS or Azure environment. The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner or Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) are great early on. You don’t need them to get a job, but they can show recruiters you're serious. Then, stack on more practical, intermediate certs (like AWS Solutions Architect Associate or AZ-104) when you feel ready. Definitely apply to internships as much as possible, but also start building a presence online. Maybe a GitHub with your cloud projects, or even posts on LinkedIn showing what you’re learning. Follow your interests too but with intention. If you're curious about DevOps, play with CI/CD pipelines. If security piques your interest, try setting up least privilege access or configuring network firewalls in the cloud. Over time, your interests will naturally start guiding you toward the kind of engineering roles you’d enjoy most.",

If you're getting 0 interviews now, job hunting \"full time\" will continue to get you 0 interviews. When you're not even getting *interviews*, that's not a problem you can solve by just buckling down and committing more time to the search.\n\nIf you were struggling with leetcode, or performing well in interviews, that argument would hold more weight. More interview practice means better performance. But you're not even getting the interview. That's not something that'll get better if you \"practice\" 8 hours a day.

It's always easier to find a job while you're employed with an income. An important consideration a lot of people don't think about is because you have an income you have the power to reject job offers that aren't good fits. Imagine you get another offer for a role *just like* the one you're currently in. Obviously you wouldn't want to accept that, right? That's the whole reason you're job searching, to get away from this kind of role.\n\nWhen you're employed, you just turn down the offer, and you continue the job search. There's no rush.\n\nWhen you're unemployed, you feel an intense pressure to accept *anything* because you need to put food on the table. So you accept a bad offer, and inadvertently end up back at square one.\n\nHold onto this job, and job search on the side. This is how most people change jobs.",

I'm not sure what infra you are working on, but when I took an infra job, I ultimately left because I was frustrated with the shit code we wrote and the lack of any sort of real development work. I did all sorts of stuff with cloudflare tunnels, DNS migrations, and dealt with TLS certs, plus on call. The work I really wanted to do, on the database engine, was just not a priority for us, compared to cloud operations.\n\nI've seen juniors and new grads do well on infra teams, so it's definitely possible, but all things career progression depend on how much you excel in your roll, and the opportunities your org has to promote you. I'd say that's equally true as a junior engineer trying to make senior in 5 years, as it is for a senior trying to make staff and looking for projects with company wide impact, at least under the system of stack ranking that will average on the organization level.\n\nI basically left infra to go back to product, and am trying to make staff now as a team lead. There's no shortage of impactful projects, especially if you can step up and be a leader. I am hesitant to think one domain mints more staff engineers than another, and I'm staring down a company wide rollout of our project for next year, so that hasn't been the case with me.\n\nIn my experience, the biggest factor is just what you want to do. I tried infra, didn't like it, so went back to product. If you like infra, do it, the amount of work is pretty much insane, and when you don't like it, you'll really struggle to outcompete the equally smart people who do. Most of the job is simply showing up everyday, moving the ball, and stepping up when you need to. If you're looking for opportunities, there's no shortage of that in either domain.",

Product engineering relies heavily on quick iteration, optics, and easily marketable impact which can be hard to do with infrastructure and legacy systems.

Sometimes the skill is also in realizing that they've asked the wrong question and proposing an alternate question with a more useful answer.\n\nUnless you've very recently answered the same question for someone else, or the question is related to the work you were doing moments before the conversation began, being able to give a deep, accurate, off the cuff answer is not expected. Give the best answer you can in the moment, be clear that it's a preliminary answer, tell the person you'll get back to them with a more complete answer soon, and then follow through on that promise as quickly as possible, e.g. via email or chat. (In my position, the real challenge is having time to follow up on question A before I get questions B, C, and D coming in...)\n\nThe other senior engineers you see answering questions off the cuff are either answering about their current work, or giving a rehearsed answer to a common question, or (worst case) bluffing about how complete/correct their answer is. You might occasionally encounter someone with a near photographic memory for technical things, but it's not the norm. I don't expect it from my team, and I don't feel like others expect it from me.",

So I think the answer that I would have here is to think about what you're doing to set yourself apart from others and how you're showcasing this to potential employers.\n\nOther than that, I'd say that software engineering jobs seem harder to come by than usual, even for those with experience, and the first job people find after college in their career field is typically the most difficult job search they have, so finding a job will probably take a while. TBH 100+ job applications really isn't that much and I kind of think you have unrealistic expectations on how long and how much work goes into finding a job as a new grad.\n\n  \nAlso, in addition to the resume advice others are giving you above that you should listen to, your resume also seems to be missing a skills section which generally should be included for a software engineering or other technical role.",

When you work for a company like that, you're basically signing up for onboarding yourself in 6 months, and committed to staying out of the bottom 5-10% of the team.\n\nAt larger companies, there's opportunity to really go beyond your role, the performance review process is standardized, and when you submit a a promo packet, you'll get a response. I don't think it's that bad, but I also stepped up as a Senior to be in a team lead role, so that's a sort built in \"exceeds expectations\" as long as we deliver impact every perf period. It's fine to be motivated by money, I check stock price all the time, but the challenging nature of the work means folks that are passionate really hold an advantage.\n\nAs far as concern over getting PIP'd. I've found that the people on the PIP shortlist are the same ones that are more motivated by money than actually becoming better software engineers. In a workplace like a large company with stack ranking, you're not only competing against smart people, but smart people who are highly motivated and ambitious to move ahead.",

How can we facilitate this so it works for both of us?\n\nOn the mentor side, I’ve been working for a little over 5 years now, and I’ve always liked asking a lot of questions to my mentees to figure out how they would like to be supported, and then go from there to see what I can do to help them. This can come as direct advice from my side, sponsoring them to pick up or lead projects that can help them reach their goals, or putting them in touch with other folks within the team or company that could help them better than I can!

For example, say you infringe a copyright as a part of your work, and the company gets in trouble for it. Or if you leak sensitive company information and it causes damages to the company.\n\nIt's still a scary clause, and one I don't recall ever seeing. Talk to a lawyer first. Most lawyers would be happy to have a quick consult with you for cheap, some might even do it for free. And I mean a *real* lawyer, not a reddit one.\n\n2 - NDA's aren't unusual. *Especially* for a paranoid startup that's still in the stage where they think everyone's out to get them. You leaking their big beautiful startup idea even a couple years after you quit could cripple the company. At least that's what they're imagining.\n\nOutside of the startup world, and the government-adjacent world, NDA's become less common.",

This burnout is the shape of *doing everything right* you learned growing up - how can you abandon it when *everything went right?* \n\nIn a very human way, you somehow both know you are burning out and are also defending against realizing it by distancing yourself from the knowledge of this fact - cognitive dissonance.\n\nYou feel real bad about it and come here thinking we can provide the correct mindset for you to peacefully exist in a state of cognitive dissonance. \n\nThe only way out is to resolve it, not to live with it. That's your choice to make. \n\nYou may be lying to yourself in other ways that promote your coping with unhappiness. If you find yourself asking yourself \"do I feel this way?\" You should perhaps instead ask \"if I felt this way, what do I do?

You will never finish more work than the incoming one. That's a lost fight, so don't bother.\n\n4. You will get burnt out, no doubt, just a matter of time. You can have a Porsche and love it, but would you still love it if you spent 15 hours a day in it, every day, while you technically had an 8-hour drive? Maybe for a short while, would quickly become a burden.\n\n5. There are plenty of good companies that people enjoy working for, don't overthink it, you are not the only one who is happy with the workplace. People are not after your job, relax.\n\n6. If you establish unrealistic perspective of yourself delivering the amount of work that requires 15 hours of work and pretend you work 8 hours then they'll quickly assume you work fast and you'll be expected to work that fast all the time. Once you finally get tired of it or how other things to do in your life (working 15 hours a day is a really bad idea, means you literally have no life off work), you will be seen as underperforming out of nowhere and you'll have to answer \"some\" questions.\n\n7. Overall if you work for a good company, as you said yourself, the amount of work and team velocity is more or less known and established. If you deliver on time the amount of work you are expected to deliver, you'll be fine and that should be your performance measurement. Working 15 hours a day only means working 7 hours too long and taking 7 hours a day from your life which you will never get back and cannot buy and you will regret it when you get older. You will realize how stupid that was not to use your life, but instead you either got extra money or/and better position. Neither of which are worth it.",

I'd expect the first Spotify post to have a de facto MS expectation for a new grad.\n\nI have an unrelated math PhD and no CS degree. 10 years ago, I would have applied to all of these and would likely have struck out on TikTok (no one wanted me in their new grad pipeline) and Spotify research (both because I'm arguably unqualified and because people focused on first-author papers and conference \"quality\" *do not* know how to interpret math CVs). The others probably would depend on which way the wind was blowing that day and the company culture (for example, Google seems willing to talk to anyone plausible).",

I would recommend masters if you are potentially interested in research route otherwise if you want to continue with regular SWE, then your position, salary etc will solely depend on your interview performance and if an undergrad does better than you, they will end up with a better salary. So imo masters won’t be a good bet. \n\nWould highly recommend reading technical books to work on your fundamentals and get them strong and in parallel work on your soft skills (this is a game changer that most engineers don’t focus on and allows one to stand out). Doing this catapulted my career to senior from new grad in under 2 years over other engineers with 3-4x the amount of experience.The books you read will depend on what you want to focus on. For eg, my area of work was distributed systems so the main books I read were around that but the general ones I recommend are the following 2: DDIA, philosophy of software design. Then also diving into design patterns, pragmatic programmer, etc\nBased on what you are curious to learn and specialize in (FE, BE, DE, DS etc) you pick up relevant books there and start diving in. Also you don't have to read books cover to cover (though the previous 2 I mentioned, do read cover to cover) unless they excite you or you think you are learning from them. I usually use books as a frame of reference so when I get stuck I know where to look (tbh AI like ChatGPT has made that much easier now).\nFor soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.",
