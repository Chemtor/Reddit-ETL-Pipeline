        "body": "Well, its important to remember that the Kimball and Inmon standards were developed in the 80s.  I think there‚Äôs three key trends that have happened in ensuing decades that explain the mess we‚Äôre in today:\n\nFirst and most obviously, computing has gotten exponentially more powerful. A big part of the reason people cared so much was because they literally had to. Nowadays, no one gives a crap, and if you‚Äôre a conspiracy theorist, you could even argue that medallion architecture is being perpetuated by cloud providers as a way to extract more money from their clients. \n\n**Quick edit based on some responses:** I‚Äôm definitely not saying there aren‚Äôt any positive aspects to medallion architecture and ELT supplanting ETL. But whether it‚Äôs *necessary* is a different question and one that, IMO, businesses should really think long and hard about rather than just defaulting to whatever the FAANG companies are doing or whatever the vendor‚Äôs recommendation is. Maybe I‚Äôm just old, but I can recall a time when the bronze layer lived in an FTP site (lol) and the Gold layer didn‚Äôt exist, and yet companies were still able to answer business questions and turn a profit. \n\nSecond, and somewhat related, technology just moves so fast that you‚Äôre migrating platforms every couple years, in some cases. There‚Äôs a sense that tech debt is unavoidable, and the Agile/MVP approach exacerbates this as well. So no one really cares as much about getting things right the first time, because you know you‚Äôll have to rebuild it anyway. \n\nThird, while the concept of ‚Äúdata‚Äù has been democratized and de-mystified quite a bit in the ensuing four decades, the actual database part of it still has somewhat of a barrier to entry. So I think part of the issue is that ‚ÄúCan I get this in Excel to do my own analysis?‚Äù has become such a ubiquitous question that you can‚Äôt really say no to it, leading to a bunch of bespoke OBTs that aren‚Äôt documented particularly well, if at all. \n\nIMO modeling is still important, but it‚Äôs largely because of BI/Data Viz software adoption and not database constraints themselves anymore.",

Im being serious this is a \"pub\" kinda question that sadly I dont have collegues that share the same spark to discuss with.\n\nThis industry has evolved so fast that terms have been highly convoluted and become some what meaningless. \n\nWhen I began my career Kimball was king and the data mart with at least star schemas were the expected minimum. Largely because of the limits of what we had (relational databases with indexes). To get things to work you had to thoroughly understand the requirements, plan and model accordingly.\n\nCompute and Storage are cheaper than beer (sadly), with that has come with the more lazy approach in favour of quick (although unstable) returns. We follow agile, we don't like long winded projects and if your query doesn't work then just add more compute.\n\nWith this a generation has been bombarded with buzzword bingo. We have data lakes, lake houses, and other infrastructure terms. We also have data mesh, fabric and other strategic ideas that i always feel are more idealised than realistic. A person can only retain so much and indeed the core ideas of warehousing have disappeared. I asked someone if they would consider implementing surrogate keys, he asked me if I had made that up.\n\nIt does feel like we are re learning alot of the problems that we had in the 80s just in different guises. I feel that maybe were just old enough to notice the turn of the wheel. What was learned will be forgotten and re learned again.\n\nModelling will always be important, but modelling relies of having some key information.... like what do you actually want to achieve? What are you measuring.... I think most of this sub will admit.... actual requirements are always few and far between. Keeps us busy rebuilding stuff though lol.\n\nId love to see what the modern equivalent of erwin is?\n\nAnyway... your not alone...\n\nDo you know what would be cool.... a podcast going through the datewarehouse tool kit and data modelling!",

They don't want to talk about it because they don't have a solution to make it more productive.  So, instead of admitting that it's a hard problem and they mostly work on the easy problems, they instead just try not to talk about it.\n\nThey *should* talk about it - since it impacts performance, data quality, query functionality, usability, and operational and development complexity.   And practitioners should also talk about it for the same reason.  But this field has always been marketing-driven, and data modeling is difficult.  So, they don't talk about it like we did 25 years ago.\n\nBut that doesn't mean nobody is.  It definitely still matters when operating at scale, whether that's data volumes, performance and query response time or its the number of fields, feeds, and models.",

When I started my professional career in data, a 2-year Datawarehouse build-out project was the norm. We used to do rigorous requirements gathering (for months!), hire a multitude of skilled people to document the business processes, track down data sources and cover every inch of the enterprise reporting needs on paper. Then the laborious phase of ETL, physical data modeling, test runs, and QA will ensue. Finally some BI team would develop the static reports and before you know it, it‚Äôs already 2 years gone!\n\nNowadays, every single business comes pre-wired to collect and move streams of raw data all over the place. Costs of data storage have significantly dropped so dumping it all in into a cheap cloud storage is a no-brainer and it‚Äôs an acceptable approach. Storage and compute are now segregated so no upfront unutilized servers anymore. \n\nI guess the fundamental idea behind serving data analytics has switched from building robust, audited and reliable DW architectures to just-in-time data modeling for a quick turnaround to answer a certain business question ASAP. It also allows for incremental question-answering with the same just-in-time analytics approach instead of asking business stakeholders exactly what questions they‚Äôd need answered for next 10 years and expecting them to have an answer for you. \n\nI‚Äôd say it‚Äôs just a paradigm shift that has acceptable flaws with upside advantages that outweigh the said flaws (i.e. lack of emphasis on the traditional DW approaches we built our careers around in the past).\n\nEdit: also wanted to mention how the term ‚Äúdatawarehouse‚Äù has now been usurped by the vendors to mean ‚Äúsnowflake, redshift or GCP‚Äù. Not the Kimball or Innmon style datawarehouses we used to build. In fact, Bill Innmon (he‚Äôs in my LinkedIn network) wrote a very expressive LI post about this a year ago. Now I see even him kind of coming to terms with the fact that the old school DW as a industry and a domain is dead.",

With the advent of 'off the shelf' solutions like JDE, Peoplesoft, SAP...etc the need to design your own models fell off a cliff.  While a BI/DW model is designed differently, it was generally the people with existing OLTP model knowledge that went down this path as well.\n\n\\- As others have stated in this thread, 3NF or better modelling was a means to help squeeze the best performance out of hardware solutions.  This is not as much a concern now.\n\n  \n\\- The 'need for speed' (AGILE) has caused our industry to get lazy and not worry about design.

I did this a while back with the snowflake query log so I could understand our costs better. Try to get to a point where writing the SQL to answer your questions flows naturally and quickly. The follow-up questions are especially important because that's where the complexity will come out.\n\nYou'll need to back this up with good theory which can come from a few places\n\nFor textbooks I really like T-SQL fundementals by Itzik Ben-Gan. It's focused on SQL Server, but it covers a lot of generic SQL, and it has a really good explanation of the core concepts. Things like three-value predicate logic make a lot more sense with his explanations. I generally recommend people at least read the first chapter. I think you can find a free PDF somewhere but I just bought it on amazon (almost exactly 10 years ago!)\n\nWebsites like Leetcode CAN be good because of the ability to compare your answers to others, but it's important not to blindly trust that someone else's approach is better. If you see faster solutions, look up the techniques they are using and try to understand if it's actually an improvement or just or just a hack for that specific dataset.\n\nFor performance, Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann provides a lot of the theoretical foundation you'll need to understand how to think about queries, you'll need to supplement this with resources specific to the database you are working in.  \n\n\nFor snowflake I found some articles on [https://articles.analytics.today/](https://articles.analytics.today/) helpful.

It simplifies a lot of the tediousness of using DBT with Airflow (v2.9). It is easy to generate your DBT assets and those can be linked with your other dagster assets.\n\nThe main difference is the paradigm. Dagster does not have jobs/tasks at the forefront. Jobs are a process to group functional assets together i.e. you have 1 ingestion process and 3 DBT models to generate your analytics table and you can ran all of them at once, on schedule.   \n\n\nDagster uses data assets at the forefront, which are what the name suggests, your data as an asset. You do not think of the process of creating the data as you think of the final data product. \n\nI ike the lineage feature, which allows you to see how all your assets are interconnected. You can define a job with a schedule for any cut of your lineage graph.\n\nDagster is also more pythonic than Airflow. You use python's best practices when writing your processes.\n\nTesting is much simpler with the integrated 'dagster dev' command which quickly spins up a local instance for you to test your pipelines. \n\nCan write a lot more about the difference but I am at work now :-D.\n\nTo conclude, both are good tools (haven't tried Airflow v3+) but for different needs. Dagster is better for companies where data lineage is vital, whereas Airflow is better for automation of tasks.   \nData pipelines are good in both (however, in dagster it gets tedious to integrate a random pipeline with the rest of your asset lineage)",

In a business people say the same thing 10 different ways and it's often hard for the LLM to interpret what they mean, especially in the context of your business.  I found we needed synonyms not only for tables and columns but for values as well and sometimes the context that was relevant to the answer was who asked the question.

All it takes is a single command to add a column to a table, it‚Äôs really not hard, especially with the small volumes you are working with. And there are tools like Alembic which someone‚Äôs already mentioned to help you version, test and deploy these sorts of changes easily and reliably.\n\nSo ‚Äúmy Data is going to change and evolve‚Äù is really not a good reason to use a document store like mongo.\n\nThe use case for a document store is really when your data is literally arbitrary. By this I mean that it will be completely different from one document to the next. And there‚Äôs no particular reason to expect any record to overlap with any other.\n\nEven if there is a subset of your data which really does fit this description, you can still allow for it in Postgres with the use of the jsonb column type which others have mentioned.\n\nBut from what you‚Äôve described, your data probably is very similar and predictable from one record to the next. All the personnel are presumably going to have names and IDs and other common properties. In this context, you are giving up a lot by using a document store, such as the ability to reliably query the data, to enforce rules that maintain quality and integrity, and to optimise for certain use cases. These things will likely cause you pain down the track that is much worse than what you think you‚Äôre avoiding by not having to worry about schema evolution.",

When you understand what they do, how they're talking with their counterparts you get a better feel for what they need communicated. Alternatively, having a mentor-type person who can give you direct feedback.\n\n- Talking with people directly, asking: \"hey, I just gave you this explanation but I want to improve and want to know which information is useful to you and which one isn't. Knowing what you know now - what would the ideal explanation be for you?\"\n\n- asking directly how technical the explanation should be, and adjusting on the fly.\n\n- slightly different background (R&D) but I learned that explaining the thing that happened in the order that it happened makes for terrible story telling. You need to figure out what the value is for someone, and then cut all the explanations that are not useful in, well, explaining it. That's a tough one for me because it also meant having to let go of my ego - as in: having to drop some information and explanations that I really found good / useful when they don't help in making the messageseven clearer.\nMaybe \"Storytelling with data\" is helpful for some situations?\n\n- I'm not saying that's the case for you but for me one big learning was that I'm probably not the most important person, and that what makes my job interesting to me is not relevant at all. It also doesn't matter whether my solution is picked - not whether it's implemented in the way that I envisioned it. What matters is that the team as a whole benefits from an idea - I had to shift to a broader view of things rather than just of me and my work. This takes self-reflection and it also takes experience. \n\n- Also, what I do is a service to others. Have a look at leaders who have a service-mentality to their leadership style and try to emulate them.\n\nGenerally, what helped was direct feedback and interacting with colleagues. What worked less is trying to figure things out by reading and thinking it through - that useful sometimes but it doesn't cut through my echo chamber. What's still missing for me, some people need an explanation that's not an explanation but a story that they can digest on their level of understanding - I sometimes struggle if I have to simplify it so much that the story stops being meaningful to me.",

I don't think winning the competition alone is going to help you without a strong portfolio of other projects, but it would make for good essay/statement of interest material to describe why you're looking for a career pivot.\n\nIn my experience, unless they've already made the job description with an existing candidate in mind, colleges and universities are good places to start. They aren't super fixated on production-level experience, usually have some super passionate people, and chill workloads. You could start by looking for jobs at local colleges or something like HigherEd Jobs. \n\nBest of luck!",

I've seen people called a Sr DE with 2 years of experience as a DE, Ive seen someone called a Lead DE because they moved from a Lead DBA role to their first DE role. I know a person in consulting who is just a DE and has been a DE or SWE for 15 years. He is far better at coding that I am, and makes more money, but doesn't have the same level of title as others with far less skills. \n\nMyself, I spent my first year writing code, building pipelines, fixing bugs and closing tickets. Then everything changed and I am now running teams of implementation partners to build out enterprise projects. Nowadays, the only coding I do is to review PRs. I draw up architecture, work cross functionally with other teams to solution things, and tell my teams what all needs to be done with some guidance on how to do it. Someone else at a different company would need to work 10 years before being trusted to do what I do now. My job title will change to Sr DE next year per my manager. And I'll have 2 years of DE experience at that point, and a year of that is barely technical. \n\nFor a standard 3rd year DE, if one even exists, I would start to expect a little more autonomy. Learn to make decisions. Start figuring out and proposing architecture. Start mentoring younger DEs and try to lead some small projects if you aren't already. By this point, you shouldn't need to be told what to do on a project, you should be able to identify what needs to be done, and work to implement it. A big thing is that you should probably at least start working with other teams on cross functional projects. Begin thinking about business value of various projects. \n\nI learned, albeit slowly, that maintaining collaborative relationships with other teams is vastly more valuable than transactional relationships. They are more complicated to manage, but it is the only approach I've seen work to actually get things done. Churning out tickets and bug fixes is a good way to inflate your performance numbers, but it rarely amounts to career growth or any of the stuff you work on actually being used by the business as a whole.",

When you are ready, you will know you are.  \n\nData Engineering is like getting a Ph.D in random intertwined data problem solving.  It's not entry level, and it's certainly not something you can do with a class or two.  \n\nStart with analytics, dashboards, learn where the pipelines go, and then start moving up.  Once you understand the processes going on, find the next process in line.  Keep doing this until you can look at data and understand the whole business use case and story behind the data you're looking at.  \n\nThis takes a long time.",

It will depend on how many files you are processing per run as well..so if you are processing only one gzip file per run, only one executor will read it because it has to decompress it alone.\n\nSo if you set the min to 20 nodes and you are processing only one gzip file, you will have 19 idle executors doing nothing\n\nProbably spark realizes that and gets the min because it can't set it to less than that, but it would if it could because it doesn't make sense to have more.",

My guess is spark looked at the code submitted and calculated that it's more efficient to run it with a smaller number of workers rather than scaling out (maybe because the data isnt huge so it's faster to do it all on one node?). Spark may be wrong about this since you're using gzip files so maybe try converting/saving to parquet first and then running your data processing on the parquet files and see what happens. Gzip typically takes more time to decompress so breaking the job into two parts (decompressing in part 1 and transforming data in part 2) could help triage the issue better. Do you see performance gains when using more nodes? \n\nUDFs typically aren't great for performance, what does the UDF do specifically? I've found the built in functions are pretty good at doing what you want if you're a little creative, plus they're going to be faster. Also if you're using >30 withColumn statements that could be slowing down performance a bit since i believe each one makes spark recalculate the logical plan, so you could try using withColumns instead.",

Sit down with key business people and find the most important questions they want answering.\n\nThen, find what data sources you'll need to answer those questions. In the beginning, this is typically financial reporting / sales related. How much money are we making, etc.\n\n2. Focus on delivering these core information sets at first, before doing ANYTHING more fancy. Give the business the ability to answer their super basic, but essential questions.\n\n3. Data stack:\n\nAzure is fine, but i'd personally reccomend AWS or GCP.\n\nSimilar with Databricks - it's fine and will work, but they specialise in data science, you're probably better off with BigQuery or Snowflake if the focus is analytics.\n\nI'd avoid PowerBI and use Tableau. Or, if you can afford it, Looker.\n\nOpen source tooling is great. I'd highly reccomend dbt for the data transformation layer. And airflow for orchestration.\n\nData ingestion, as you've mentioned, as a one person  team. managed pipelines are a good place to start: airbyte, fivetran or stitch. Just be conscious of costs here as they can rack up, versus custom implementations (using lambdas, ECS etc).\n\nFeel free to dm me any questions!",

        "body": "\nFirst off, I have to say I'm genuinely curious, how did you land a DE role without an IT background? That‚Äôs seriously impressive. Many folks on this sub will tell you that DE isn't an entry-level position, so you must have done something right to get your foot in the door.\n\nRegarding your question, it's smart to focus on the fundamentals. It‚Äôs easy to get lost in the sea of specific \"data engineering\" tools, but they all build on a few core IT concepts. My advice would be to focus on these areas for the next six months.\n\n1. The first thing I'd focus on is the programming basics. Since you're using Python, I would go deep on that. Don't just learn syntax, but really try to grasp the fundamentals so you can solve problems with it. Do a few mini-projects in pure Python to make the concepts stick. This will be your foundation for everything else.\n\n2. Next, you need to become very comfortable with SQL. It‚Äôs the language of data, and you'll be using it constantly. Understand what it is, get the basic syntax down, and then really practice with it. Microsoft has some great sample datasets like AdventureWorks that are perfect for learning things like joins and aggregations.\n\n3. While you're learning those, the third crucial piece is Git. It doesn't matter if your company uses GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket; the principles are the same. You absolutely need to understand the basic workflow of making a branch, committing your changes, and merging them. It's how all modern tech teams collaborate. As a bonus, look into what a simple CI/CD pipeline does, maybe with something like GitHub Actions.\n\n4. Finally, try to get a basic understanding of one cloud provider. It doesn‚Äôt matter which one‚ÄîAWS, Azure, or GCP. I'd probably stick with AWS since it‚Äôs the most common right now. You don't need to be an expert, but learn the core concepts. Studying for one of the associate-level certifications is a great way to get a structured overview.\n\nIf you can get a good handle on these things by your sixth month, you'll have the solid IT foundation you need for this role. Only then would I start worrying about the more advanced, specific DE concepts. Everything will make much more sense once you have these basics down.",

Separately, you can research whatever systems your team is using and break down by categories:\n\n1. SQL: Learn how to write SQL queries (use documentation for whatever language you're using and look up videos for that specific langauge).\n2. Database structures: Whether you're using on premise servers or cloud services, look up documentation for those platforms and look at some videos to get an overview of how they store and process data.\n3. Pipelines and job scheduling: Learn about which service(s) are used to create data pipelines and schedule jobs and how they work.\n4. Version control: Learn about the codebase you're working in, what coding standards they have (rules for writing sql queries, DDL, DML, dags, etc....) and how to use github and your IDE (probably VScode).\n\nI would start by learning what's most relevant to your day to day work and then learn more about each area as you go. You will also need to understand what the modeling and data in your pipelines represent. Being able to explain data to the business is equally important to technical knowledge of how to store and manage data.",

Depending on the setup this can be done using OPC-UA for most SCADA systems.  I've seen in Pharma before that most manufacturing has a gateway so you can pull off the gateway instead which aggregates several PLCs/machines to pull from a common point.  Most of that data is pushed to a pub/sub like Kafka or some other MQ. The schema for each step in most manufacturing processes is based on how the cards are programmed on the PLC. Since message queuing systems can handle schema evolution, you can usually combine this with a schema registry so you can see the steps and versions.  Now getting it into a structure built for OLAP is not the easiest.  There might be controls engineers that already have a common data model for reporting on just the OT.  This is needed to understand signals, etc.  They might also have a digital twin which represents a virtual system so you can begin modeling yourself. There are decent articles discussing OT/IT convergence but there is no silver bullet ( https://iot-analytics.com/it-ot-convergence-27-themes-define-future-of-industrial-integration/). If the schema isn't defined anywhere, there are tools like Apache Flink that can use schema inference, however you are still going to need to figure out the model so you know what step stage relates to what schema and how keys (columns) are related to each other.  It takes some work but again there is an automation and controls engineer that has to have that somewhere.",

It‚Äôs like the opposite of sales lol.\n\nThe software is often just a means to get the manufacturing equipment to work. The engineers in OT are more operational focused and have a different set of responsibilities. They are also very busy most of the time and want to get things working and keep them working. There is typically no laboratory setup where they can isolate data and services out for stuff like analytics.\n\nAlso, manufacturing is usually a low margin business, so there‚Äôs not a lot of spare change there for new initiatives which take time to show value.\n\nGood news is, overall I have been seeing lots of push over the past 5 years for more integration of OT with IT, as the link you provided shows. I think this started in security as OT has been a vulnerable gateway into IT, since it‚Äôs not been hardened from a security standpoint. Example, there‚Äôs a ton of pressure to not touch anything for simple stuff like firewall or patches when the greater risk is perceived as bringing a production line down.\n\nHopefully some of the success stories start getting more visibility over time and we can learn from examples of where value is created from integrating OT data where everyone can access it and use it to improve the company overall.\n\nOne tip is see if there are any relationships built in your group with the OT group. Usually I‚Äôve found this less of a technology issue but more of a perception and priorities issue.",

We also took part in **MWC Barcelona in both 2023 and 2024,** and while it is a massive event, it offered solid technical content around AI, IoT and digital transformation with live demos and case studies.\n\nFor developer-focused tracks, **Berlin Buzzwords** is a good choice if you‚Äôre into data engineering and search technologies, and the **Data Innovation Summit in Stockholm** usually brings very practical case studies. Since you mentioned **apidays in London**, that one is definitely worth checking out too because it covers APIs and AI with a good balance of technical content and ecosystem discussions.",

For some like Salesforce it's easy as they publish their model and your CRM team get to add custom fields. You can then pull a source entity such as Customer or Case into your data platform. Other tools like Siebel will have 5,000 tables of which 100 will contain domain data, each of those tables will have 100 of columns so the task here is the identify which tables and columns are relevant - depending on how the system is configured. The final example is Success Factors, here they expose data through reports and APIs. The internal schema is their IP and not shared, but you can find out from the API spec or report engine what you can extract. \n\nMy last 2 projects has kept data for ingestion close to the source with an initial seed load and then the delta loads.  After that we current have a raw data vault which is essentially facts and type 2 history tables. Then we have the business consumption layer which applies any business logic that allows the BI team to create their dashboard. \n\nIf I had asked you to do this then I would not want a generic schema for source but details of what I can get from the source system as raw maintaining their schema. Then its the best way to manage a staging environment that manages the history. \n\nIf you have a number of the source schema ready then it's best to clarify what your manager's expectations are. \n\nWhat is your environment ?",

Or can I just, lets say, write a json to represent the order and send it directly to the pipeline, keeping the production schema only with `customers` and `products` tables? Would that be too far from what actually happens in real scenarios? I'm afraid I may be oversimplifying things.\n\nI'm guessing that, in the \"real world\", an e-commerce needs to write the customer orders first in its production database to keep track of stuff similar to what I described in the last paragraph of my post. Should I take that into account for my project? If yes, for how long the data is kept in production? After an order is considered *closed*, can it be instantly deleted from the database to live only in the warehouse?",

Much more memory efficient, and the API is much nicer to work with. Read the Polars user guide, but maybe start this part first: https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/migration/pandas/\n\nPS: Don't depend on external software, if possible.

If you already have data in an indexed table that's optimized for your workload, it would be a poor decision to write it to a temp table.\n\nIf you can subset a (relatively) small amount of data from your big, indexed table, and put it in a temp table, it may be worth it.

Synapse/Data Factory will be more than enough for the ingestion and starting the dbt task.\n\nProbably out of your decision, but I don't understand any company that will push for Synapse when also using powerbi in 2025. Fabric is what Microsoft is pushing & Databricks is much better than Synapse. Both are better futureproof options, with many more features. If you can try to sway them one of thode wats way (or simply bring in a MS/Databricks representative to do it for you).\n\nMake sure you know that DBT will not work in Synapse on `spark SQL`. You need to use the Microsoft SQL flavor, which differs quite a lot (it gets weird) & can get quite expensive. On Databricks (and I believe also Fabric) spark SQL does work. Also since you're in governement. Spatial/geo support is very limited in this SQL flavour. I know Databricks (& again probably Fabric) has better support.",

Ship fast where the blast radius is small, slow down where correctness matters.\n* Invest in tooling mastery. Know your editor, shell, OS, browser devtools, and typing. The compounding payback is huge.\n* If you cannot explain why something is hard, it is probably incidental complexity. Remove that first.\n* Fix bugs by establishing invariants one layer deeper instead of sprinkling checks in leaf code.\n* Use history to debug. Read the commits, narrow the regression window, and run git bisect when the shape fits.\n* Bias toward shipping to get real feedback. Use pragmatic shortcuts like asserts on invariants, deferring DTOs, and skipping trivial tests when risk is low.\n* Make debugging cheap. Seed data easily, add local tracing, keep a scratch REPL file, enable frontend debug toggles, dump full state with diffs, and add helpers to jump the UI into target states.\n* On a team, ask questions early. Do the five minute search first, then get unblocked fast.\n* Protect shipping cadence. Aim for quick deploys, low bug rates, fast cross-team handoffs, reusable patterns, and lean process. Cut the 10 percent of a feature that eats 50 percent of the time. \n* Treat slow shipping as a problem to root cause.\n* Learn to code review. a code review is an invitation for feedback and to get another pair of eyes on your work. To catch issues before it goes to QA.",

With a human language, if you know it well, then you can really express ANY IDEA AT ALL with finesse and comprehensibility. But with programming languages it's not really that way at all. Although formally programming languages that are \"Turing complete\" can be used to express any program, in actual practice, some tasks/types of programs are definitely way easier in some languages than others. \n\nProgramming languages are tools, more like a hammer and a saw. You need to know how to use both of those, based on what task you are going to do. Also there are many types of hammer, many times of saw, just like there are many flavors of some programming languages that resemble each other. When you're first learning, you should learn to use an easy-to-use one, a safe one, etc. Later on, you can learn to use more powerful tools, more specialized tools.\n\nIt is the same in programming, except the tools change frequently and depend a lot on in what domain you are working.\n\nIn Web development for example you're likely to use a lot of JavaScript. In other domains JS is making headway with Node.js but to me it's still not used as much. The other languages you mentioned (PHP, SQL) are that way as well. Most people don't consider HTML a programming language because you can't write a loop, there's no real control flow, etc. It is possible to \"modularize\" HTML though, so there's that. Nowadays though it seems like most people prefer to generate HTML rather than to code it by hand.\n\nAlso SQL is a very specialized language used to query a database. For example, what would \"hello world\" look like in SQL? Can you make a command-line app in SQL? Maybe it's technically possible, but I would not want to maintain such code if you gave it to me. I would much rather maintain the Python version of such a tool.",

So is reading introductory material that's nonspecific, verbose, and has no immediate connection to something you actually care about. What you can do is make the process more interactive, provide faster feedback, and tailor it to your attention span.\n\nInstead of thinking about \"all the cool stuff\", pick one item from the list. Just one, ideally the most exciting one. Then try to make that, and only that. It will probably be way too big and difficult, which is why you need experience building smaller things first. But you don't need these smaller things to be completely unrelated to your project, which is however what you'll get by following standard tutorials.\n\nNo one dreams of making \"hello world\", but even something incredibly complex can be turned into something simple by removing almost all of the details first. That way, what's left will be directly related to the eventual end result and you can see, in your mind, the next steps that will get you closer to the \"real thing\".\n\nEven if you never get there, the process is inherently motivating. You may find that you know exactly what to do, but not how exactly it could be done. That's good, because now you're intrinsically motivated to learn. You need to find out and understand what you don't in order to get further, and you'll automatically know what to ignore (because it doesn't help you go in this direction).\n\nIf you need specific examples, feel free to elaborate on your project ideas. But don't try to follow popular guidance if it isn't working. Most teachers, and the learning resources they create, are bad and won't work for a large proportion of students. There's no universal solution and no replacement for intrinsic motivation. If learning isn't fun on a regular basis, you'll struggle and not everyone can just \"power through\" until it \"gets fun\". That's not a failure, just a mismatch in strategy.\n\nThe good news is that the beginning is by far the most difficult part of learning programming. Once you've attained some level of mastery, motivation comes much easier since being good at something is inherently rewarding.",

Yes, it's cumbersome and annoying, but it pays off.\n\nMost importantly: Code. No matter what. If you ain't got nothing else write a hello world program. Change the code, experiment with it. Yes, I read that you're a CSE grad, but you need the experience and especially the feeling and confidence that comes with it.\n\nAnd then learn to read documentation and references instead of googling. Your code looks like Python. So go ahead and read through the whole Python reference. You don't need to memorize it, and you can skip through stuff, but make sure you read all the function names and at least a little bit of what they do, and it will help you a lot to get some confidence and a starting point if you're looking for something. After that, pick some \"most used libraries\" (feel free to google it) and read a few examples for each, or the reference docs if you can afford to.\n\nThere's no easy way, you have to go ahead and invest the time and brain cells. Again, it's not about memorizing everything, but having read stuff at least once will give you a better feeling for a language, what to find where, where to start, and some confidence.\n\nGood luck, I think the thing you're most lacking right now is confidence, and there ain't no better way to establish that than knowing that you worked hard.",

You can compile an OS, and you can also compile a compiler, but you have to have an existing compiler to do this. So there's a *historical* question of where these compilers came from. And the basic answer is that if you were starting from absolutely nothing, you would have to work your way up from very simple compilers/assemblers, and use those to compile more complex ones.\n\nFor instance, you start out with a system that has no assembler at all. It only understands raw binary machine code, fed to it using some input method. This might be a paper tape reader, or a punched card reader, or toggle switches that let you manually enter data one bit/byte at a time.\n\nThen you write an assembler in machine code, and feed it to the computer. Now you can write programs in assembly code instead of machine code. Then you can write a C compiler in assembly language. And so on.\n\nOnce you have a C compiler, you can rewrite that compiler in C instead of assembly, so that it's easier to maintain. And then it can compile new versions of itself. This is called [\"self-hosting\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_%28compilers%29).\n\nBut remember, this is a *historical* account of how programming languages were \"bootstrapped\" over the last 70 years or so. Once you have a self-hosting compiler, you no longer need all of the previous layers of bootstrapping.",

It's what the CPU understands, by definition.\n\nGenerally the process goes something like this:\n\n1. You write source code: C, C++, Rust, Java, C#, Python, whatever.\n2. The frontend translates it into some machine oriented but still cross platform instruction set. It's usually called bytecode or intermediate representation or pcode or something like that.\n3. The backend eats the intermediate code and gives actual CPU instructions for your hardware.\n\nIntroductory programming classes love to obsess over whether a language is \"compiled\" or \"interpreted\" but there hasn't been a difference for decades, if there ever was. People just say it's \"interpreted\" if the whole 3 step process normally happens at runtime. It's all going to machine language through some intermediate regardless.\n\nA lot of code expects to be executed in the presence of an operating system which is kind of hard to depend on if you're writing the OS in the first place. So we may have to talk about \"free-standing\" versus \"hosted\" environments if we want to make our operating system, and yes, we're more likely to talk about that in the context of a language like C that's widely used both ways and even enshrines the difference in its specification.\n\nBut the real reason C and C++ (and increasingly Rust) are used for OS development is that they give you tight control over how you use memory, and there's a well established tradition of actually using that control to do things people don't typically expect to lean on other languages for. You can grab at arbitrary bytes of memory through pointers and do things that might be \"undefined\" i.e. specific to your hardware and your compiler. A lot of other languages expect that some kind of runtime environment is running under the hood, maybe including a garbage collector that cleans up memory for you, so it's more like the language tries to bring along all this infrastructure that you might want to implement yourself or do without.\n\nAlso you've got to keep in mind that there are many different levels of writing an OS. There's the kernel which can be complicated in its own right. Then there can be lots of drivers, utilities, shells, and built-in apps. A lot of the \"OS\" might be more or less just normal application code running in a hosted environment. That stuff can be written in anything, so a whole OS is not necessarily written in just one language. For example, Google did a huge project to try to start writing more of Android in Java, Kotlin, and Rust a while back, though there is still a lot of C and C++ in it. IIRC Android 13 was the first version to be less than 50% C and C++. (Edit: They were less than 50% in [new code](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/memory-safe-languages-in-android-13.html?m=1) that version.)\n\nThe point is it's all machine code in the end. The only question is if the language is accustomed to letting you do practically everything the machine code will allow, or whether you would be fighting the language's built-in assumptions to implement the OS's most basic functionality for yourself.",

Computer hardware and software is largely designed as a big old stack of layers, and understanding roughly what they are will help you understand things tremendously.\n\nIn this case, the bit you are missing is that a computer program, once compiled, is already machine code. You write a program as a text file, the format of which is the C programming language. A special program, a C compiler, takes in this text file as input and outputs a file that contains the machine code that is equivalent to what you wrote.\n\nWhen you tell the operating system to run the program, it reads the file and puts the machine code section of it somewhere in memory, then points the CPU to that spot in memory and says \"run the machine code at this address.\" The computer hardware, which knows how to run machine code, takes it from there.\n\nThe operating system itself works the same way. You write the operating system as a C program. A C compiler compiles the operating system into machine code. That machine code gets shoved into the spot where the hardware expects the operating system to be (let's ignore how that works for the moment), and so when the computer starts, it finds some machine code and runs it.\n\nEven the C compiler works the same way! You write the compiler in C, then you turn it into machine code by running it through an existing C compiler, and now you have a nice new C compiler. You may ask \"well, where did the first C compiler come from, then?\" and that would be a great question.

This is not true for C++, but it's not that difficult to replace the portions of the language grammar that are linked to to the standard library (eg, the *new* keyword).\n\nIt is entirely possible to implement some of the C standard library functions in format that is suitable for use in kernel space.

Unix Version 7 was the first version of Unix that was easily portable. It was ported from PDP-11 to Motorola 68K, x86, VAX, and more.

B is a stripped down and modified version of BCPL.\n\nThe first C compiler was written in B. Eventually, it became self hosting such that a C compiler written in B could produce a C compiler which could compile itself, producing a C compiler written in C.\n\nThe first B compiler was written in TMG, and the first TMG compiler was hand assembled using the TMG compiler specification. In other words, that compiler was written in assembly, but it was written in such a way as if it had compiled itself.\n\n>Is there something beneath that? The BIOS?

That's a different beast all to itself that programmers rarely ever need to worry about.\n\nBIOS is just a name for the startup routine and machine interface used by IBM PCs. It's usually specific to a particular motherboard and has the ultimate objective of finding and loading an operating system bootloader. BIOS has been depreciated in favor of UEFI. All modern operating systems generally shutdown firmware services and make little use of them, preferring their own drivers instead.\n\n>Or are these fundamental softwares written in high-level languages on an already functioning computer and then compiled down to machine code which gets installed on a new computer?\n\nC code that is compiled as a part of an operating system kernel and C code that is compiled as a part of a userspace application are no different. instructions are instructions.",

        "body": "A couple notes about system calls and machine code since self hosting compilers were already explained.\n\nOSes don‚Äôt use system calls because they are the subject of system calls. They exist to manage hardware and memory resources and provide them to running programs that they organize into processes and threads. A system call is when a hosted program asks the OS for something the OS has sole control over like access to the file system, a network peripheral, or the display. If you want to write an OS, part of what you‚Äôre doing is creating that management layer and providing entry points to ask for access.\n\nOn machine code. If you want to know what that really is, it‚Äôs a combination of an operation code and operands. The operation code is a number representing an operation like add or and or left shift or in complex instruction sets like x86 things like moving memory around. The operands can be the numbers of temp storage registers, a memory address, or a literal number. These enter a circular buffer of registers in the cpu and feed physical mux (input selector) components that route the operation to the appropriate physical hardware and open the correct operand supplier gates so it processes the right data. It‚Äôs more complicated than that. Look up stuff like branch predictors and the Tomasulo algorithm for examples of doing multiple things at the same time and simulating in order execution. But, machine code contains the literal control switch positions to run the cpu hardware for a given clock cycle or two. It‚Äôs the only thing the cpu actually understands.\n\nAlso, if you would like to viscerally experience self hosting compilers without much effort, there‚Äôs a Linux distribution called Gentoo which is irrationally interested in building everything from source. Setting it up takes days though a lot of that is waiting. You take a bootstrap configuration, build a customizable OS kernel for your exact hardware, and then experience using the supplied copy of the GCC c compiler to compile well everything in all its open source source file glory. Often you end up using the out of date copy of GCC to compile an updated version of GCC and GCLIB (and holy hell that takes all night sometimes). Now any rational person will tell you that there is absolutely no reason to build all this stuff from source yourself when the build command you‚Äôre using is the standard ‚Äúgcc -o2 [whatever]‚Äù that built the compiled binary distributions, but if you‚Äôd like to see it, you can. Btw, I know this because I had a friend who told me that if I really wanted to learn Linux I‚Äôd do this. He was wrong about that.",

It's unproductive, disruptive and will likely cause you to make strange learning decisions instead of rightly pursuing what is relevant or interesting to you. It is a journey and you should celebrate your milestones, even the little ones, rather than wasting energy by lamenting the fact that you haven't magically become a programming savant overnight.\n\nIt's a marathon, not a sprint, do not burn yourself out trying to 'catch up', but do be diligent as there's more than enough to distract us all these days. Anything you learn, even if not immediately applicable, is very rarely a waste of learning.\n\nLastly and probably most challengingly, really reflect on that hatred for maths. Maths is a lot like programming in that, for the most part, it's dozens if not hundreds of fairly straightforward concepts all stacked on top of each other and its the concepts you misunderstand / misapply that trip you up. If you dislike maths I'd have a good think about whether you dislike actually puzzling over it or whether your education system has constantly thrown you challenges beyond your comfort level and never given you the chance and support to address your weaker spots.\n\nSome actual learning advice / resources:\n\nOn the maths front, Engineering Mathematics by K.A. Stroud is my top pick for a zero to hero maths book if it's of interest as it really starts from the fundamentals.\n\nIf you like Python, automate the boring stuff with python is a fantastic resource, available as a website, courses on Udemy, a book, whatever floats your boat.\n\nOutside of that, honestly just do some coding puzzles online. Codingbat, codingames, codewars and loads more. Leetcode is there too but is probably best left for later once you're feeling up to it.\n\n3 months to do some well directed self study is gold.

Also, another piece of advice, find a language and stick with it for awhile.

Most of the concepts you master in one language will translate to another.\n\nOh and 17 is not late to start coding, I didn't start to learn how to code more than a tiny bit until I was in my late 20s.

A lot of my math classes in high school were just straight memorization of formulas and I despised every moment of it.

Say you've got a project in mind, something simple like making a little calculator app with HTML and JavaScript. Maybe you don't know how to do this at all. Well, how do you break that down? You need a webpage with buttons and display, and you need some JaveScript to do some work for you. So, how do you make a webpage? You can look that up. See what HTML is and how to use it. Then you can design a really simple looking calculator. How do you get javascript running on a web page? Look it up. It's simple, but you won't know without looking it up first. Then, how do you get javascript to know when you press something? How do you get javascript to change the display somewhere? You can look these up, and suddenly you know what you need to make the app. Now it's just a matter of making some simple functions to do your calculator's math and you've got something you can be proud of.\n\n  \nThe trick is, look up how to do the concept, not the specifics. So, don't look up \"JS how to add 3 + 5\", look up \"JS how to add two numbers.\" Then apply it to your situation. You get a little thinking involved, and you get a little better. Keep at it and it won't be too long before that kind of stuff is easy and you're struggling with harder things. And APIs? You'll always have to look those up.

Most projects require (or are made significantly easier) by using libraries. I start by looking up what is available, because that gives me an idea both about the problem, and about how people normally go about solving it. \n\n2. Documentation. When I have decided for a library to start with, I go over it's documentation. I specifically look for setup and \"first steps\", but everything that seems remotely interesting I will take a quick glance at. \n\n3. Forums, Blog Posts, Stackoverflow. At this stage I will probably have some questions, so I look for people who have either had the same questions and found answers, or I will look for blog posts trying to explain it. This is the only stage where I sometimes use AI, but very very rarely. I have gotten pretty good at getting to the answers with classical search engines, and getting the answers that way is normally better, since I stumble upon a lot of other information that might prove useful later.   \nAnother important skill is to find good blog posts. I blocked [medium.com](http://medium.com) completely in my browser, since it's just 95% time wasting blogs that copy and paste directly from the documentation in order to farm clicks. Self hosted blogs, especially those with a long history of similar topics, are the best. Reddit ranks somewhere in the middle. \n\nAnd the most interesting links get bookmarked and downloaded for offline viewing, especially all documentation I need.

So I need to think about whether I want to write data to file or database, and figure out how to do that. And I want to take in some parameters for the playlist, but I can do that from  a config file of some sort for now. And I'll want to pick a set of tracks which match my params - can't be that hard. Then I need to randomly pick some, and maybe randomise the order. Hmm, maybe I should try and limit the number of tracks from any one artist, or maximise it - that may be a nice parameter. I'll need to know the standard playlist format. Etc etc.\n\nSuddenly the whole project seems like something you could do in a weekend.

        "body": "That doesn't make much sense, because there's no single cognitive ability that would allow one to program successfully without being able to understand enough to create your own solutions (however poor they may be at first).\n\nIf you're talking about actual deficiencies, like those in working memory (e.g., if one has ADHD it is often impaired) then that's a very real challenge, but not one you couldn't work around. I know excellent programmers who are technically learning-disabled, they just take more time and are slower but they can still somehow do if after they gained enough practice.\n\nI think it would be worth investigating what forms of representation for information you prefer in other contexts. Usually, a combination of material works better than any specific one, but there are large individual differences. If you're using code as a reference, that is entirely different than using code to understand a concept. In fact, there are (at least) four different types of resources that people may use while programming and they all serve different purposes:\n\n1. Introductory material/tutorials: Separates information into buckets, reducing cognitive load (pre-selection and focus of attention)\n2. \"How to do X\" guides and other instructions: Complete \"recipes\" for how to do something you don't know how to do exactly, like algorithms that can be mixed and matched, or adapted to your actual needs\n3. References: No explanation, just to remember things that aren't in your memory (syntax, functions, conditions, ...)\n4. In-depth guides and explanations: Used to form connections and help you understand related details, to gradually expand your knowledge graph\n\nSome common issues I've seen are people focusing extensively on one specific type of resource, picking the wrong type for a given situation, trying to understand every detail instead of finding other resources to compare, or trying to do everything at once instead of just one individual step.\n\nThe second big issue might be the complete lack of visualization. Humans are inherently visual creatures and our visual system is the most bandwidth-heavy of all, it's really fast and (within certain limits) excellent at relaying information to your brain that would be more difficult to get in the ol' noggin by any other means. You can draw stuff on paper, in apps like EcaliDraw, or use oldschool graphics programs like Paint. Diagrams like MermaidJS also work but are usually too much effort for everyday tasks. \n\nFor some people, explaining ideas in language may be helpful. This takes more time and doesn't work unless you know roughly what you want to do, but it can be a great aid in clarifying your ideas. Even if you later delete the text, you can try explaining what you are doing and what you want to do as if someone was reading it later. Or find a real person/rubber duck and talk out loud instead.\n\nFinally, there is a difference between \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" learning. Many regular people seem to prefer the latter, where you start with a high-level idea go down further as needed. This has the benefit of reducing the cognitive load as you get to ignore all the low-level details, but this simplification can make true understanding much more difficult than necessary. It is commonly seen in math where the lecturer knows all the details and sometimes \"forgets\" to mention them or just glances over important topics, leaving students utterly confused. The reverse is also possible, and of course you can try to attack each problem from both angles. I suspect autistic people have an easier time with bottom-up approaches as the details are what allows them to really understand, while it may be overkill for someone else (but this is purely an anecdotal observation). You need to find your own preferred style and see what exactly makes it easiest for you to understand the actual problem, before you encode it into an executable program specification.\n\nPersonally, I found that \"low IQ\" or working memory deficiencies etc. may manifest in that one can't as easily (or rapidly) step through each part of a given problem in their mind, or might make more errors while doing so. But that still doesn't prevent you from doing it on paper or using any other medium, and you might find that someone who seems \"stupid\" is actually quite adept at visualizing graphically in their head instead, or they're great at teaching the material to others and thereby learn it themselves, etc.\n\nI would assume that people with severe cognitive disabilities who are \"brainess\", as you put it, have neither the capacity nor motivation to ask for programming help on Reddit. So my best guess would be a mismatch in approach or missing skillsets, not a lack of general problem-solving ability. Abstract problem solving is more difficult than doing it in context; you could try reframing the problem so it represents specific instances.",

That makes the mapping (or function, in the mathematical sense) from inputs to outputs much easier to formally describe and specify. It also makes it much easier to test.\n\nFor another, when a component has state, then its behavior depends on the order of operations that are performed on it. If you want to prove that a component will always behave a certain way, then you have to prove it for all possible orderings of operations. This tends to give you a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. It's not impossible to prove these sorts of properties, but it's something that you don't have to worry about if the component is stateless.\n\nUsually, an application *needs* to have state, in order to do what you want it to do. But by confining the state to the smallest possible \"region\" of the program, you make the both the stateful parts and the stateless parts easier to reason about, compared to how it would be if mutable state was woven throughout the program.\n\nJust as one specific example of this, programs that make heavy use of mutable global variables tend to be much harder to understand and maintain than those that pass parameters and return values around wherever they're needed.",

If it's possible to just substitute values into a computation to get an answer, it's very easy (in theory) to see where something is wrong. Once you introduce the idea that time matters, e.g. a value can be different at different points in time depending on what point a machine (of some description) is at in the computation, it starts to get much harder to debug things. Now imagine a large program/system with millions of bits of state, changing frequently. If the code doesn't produce the desired behaviour for some combination of those states, you have a bug, and it can be very hard to track down.\n2. Following on from the above, in the context of OOP vs Functional paradigms, OOP is (most agree) about associating behaviour with data. Grouping state with the code that changes it, usually modelled after some real-world thing (but not necessarily). In this way it encourages statefulness and mutation of state. It attempts to balance this with encapsulation (usually enforced at compile time), so that only certain code can access certain state. But that code is called by other code, so the positive effect of this can be limited. Contrasted with functional, where we try to write as much of the program without depending on state, meaning functions become \"pure\" (no reliance on state, no side effects, etc.). We need side effects and state changes, it's what we sell to customers, but we can push them to the very edges of the program, and wall off code that handles the messy stuff, hopefully making the rest easier to reason about and less prone to bugs. Just like OOP there is a spectrum. You can dip your toes in, or go full on.\n\nEdit, just seen you added 3. Think I basically covered it though so I'll leave it there for now. Also, interestingly, some languages are now turning off statefulness by default and having you opt into it, e.g. Rust with mut to enable assignment (distinct from initialising the value)",

But that doesn't hold for the text editor - when you load a text to edit, you don't set the state of the entire application, only the \"data-model\" that it manipulates. All the rules, all the behaviour of the program would be the same as if any other text had been loaded, and thus not directly affecting the state. The state would be like if part of the text was selected, or a dialog window was opened, or a context-menu was active.\n\nStatefulness isn't necessarily considered bad - but the more states you have, the higher complexity you are dealing with, and the higher the risk for unexpected behaviour. If you have 32 variables that can all impact the operation of the application in different ways, you have 4 billion variations, and you can't possibly test every single one of them. So the less statefulness the better.\n\nOOP can encourage statefulness because it encourages objects to be able to manipulate themselves, and store their data, i.e. their state internally. An object \"remembers\" what happened to it the last time you called some method, and behaves differently the next time, depending on previous method-calls. Pure functions do not alter their behaviour depending on state - they always behave the exact same.\n\nStatelessness is preferred because that means that the application always behaves the exact same, and always in a predictable way, thus errors can't suddenly happen when a previous un-encountered state occurs. If new errors are found, they happen because of specific input, and it can be replicated and fixed. Whereas when errors happen in stateful applications, you might not be able to replicate the exact circumstances that caused the error.\n\nAt least that is what we hope and wish for - but of course states can't be completely eliminated, and errors and bugs still show up from time to time in any kind of application.",

State is the definition of an object in the OOP sense.\n\n1 and 3:  Stateless operations are trivially parallelizable and for practical purposes obviate the memory bus part of the architecture to focus on control flow and data transformation.\n\nLet us back up a little:  Fundamentally every program is a transformation of data.  At all scales, this is what a program is.  From the macro to the function level, a program / routine / subroutine/ function, has input, performs a transformation, and provides output.  The \"provides transformation and provides output\" is the key part.  This is true even in places where it's somewhat unexpected:  Gluing APIs together is largely taking the data from one API, performing a transformation, and then outputting it to a second API.\n\nThis is the underlying premise for microservices, for instance.  They perform a single small transformation on data and output it for the next consumer.\n\nNow, let's consider a matrix consisting of all stateful branches.  This is a little opaque to think about at first, so I'll give a concrete example:  In NetHack you can mix potions, or pour potions on items, drink them, etc, and essentially do any X to any item and any potion that you can do with *any other item*.  If you have a matrix where all items are represented as rows, and the behavior of an item interacting with another item is defined by a function entry in that matrix, then you can see that the number of interactions and state transformations of the data grows exponentially with each item (for n-items it's n\\^2 possible state transformations).\n\nIt is possible to show that all stateful operations in a program can be represented this way, and so the complexity of a program grows exponentially as the number of possible distinct state-branches it can take on a given stateful object grows.\n\nSome programs, and some styles of programming (especially game programming) typically lend themselves to managing and processing large amounts of state.  With a resulting large amount of bugs.  It is difficult and takes a lot of engineering work to parallelize that in a consistent and meaningful way, and there are multiple approaches to doing so (the most ubiquitous in my experience has literally been writing your own IPC layer... jfc I hate game devs).\n\nThe graphics pipeline can nominally be viewed as a (mostly) stateless series of programs.  Ignoring some advanced counterexamples, vertex and pixel shaders inherently take input, provide output, and never operate on state at all.  But this isn't quite completely stateless, because the graphics card / driver has a set of states that you have to set for those programs to operate the intended way.  It has *minimal* state, but is not entirely stateless.\n\nThat minimal state affecting control and inputs though minimizes the difficulty in parallelizing shader operations, and once configured globally the programs are trivially parallelizable.\n\nSo, statefulness is \"bad\" from a philosophy of programming perspective where an increase in state and the number of transformations on that state increases the complexity of a program quadratically and decreases the composability and functional-ness of the program.  OOP is by definition state and operations.\n\nBUT, the truth is that some programs require state, and/or are easier to reason about statefully.  And where the rubber meets the road, you do what you need to do to get the data tranformed correctly and within acceptable external tolerances.\n\nEd: I forgot to address the side-effects problem.  State implies functions have side effects to transform persistent state.  That's the entire point of functions on persistent state.  Side-effects can sometimes be very hard to see or understand, making it harder to reason about complex programs (duh) and breaking data/transformation locality.",

One thing I learned is to always divide problems then try to solve them.\n\nAlso, you can take a UDEMEY course or two( Im currently taking Jonas's shmedtman js course to deepen my understanding of it) but always always and I can't stress this enogh, make projects. I did allot of errors while learning and one of them is to rely on toturials they trick ur brain to think u know stuff but in reality u don't, u have to build stuff on ur own after studying .\nSorry for the long paragraph , good luck\nEdit: I forgot to mention, search for the Odin project, it is very good",

        "body": "Fair warning, this is going to be very long.\n\n\nI prefer the Black Box Method to writing code. I think a lot of developers do this without really thinking about it. No matter what the program is, you should be able to break it down into some smaller steps, some important operations that need to happen for the program to work. The Black Box Method basically just involves creating placeholder functions for the more complicated operations, then coming back later to define the details of those functions. You start with the big picture, make sure it's behaving like you want, then work your way down to the finer details.\n\n\nFor example, let's say you need to build a program that can read a bunch of names from an input file and update some data files using the information from that file. It's something I've had to do at my job quite a few times now. Immediately, what are the two big things we know it needs to do?\n\n1. Read the input file\n2. Update the relevant data files\n\nSo you write whatever boilerplate you need to get going, then in your main() function, or wherever your program begins, you simply write two lines (I'm gonna be using Pythonic pseudocode from here on out):\n\n\n    def main():\n        parse_input_file()\n        update_data_files()\n\n\nAnd the key is that you don't have to define them just yet. I normally just have these placeholders display a message like \"Parsing input file...\" and \"Updating data files...\" to make things easy to debug. You can do a sanity check here and run your new program to make sure the messages are displaying in the correct order. This would be especially important to do if this is being integrated into a larger system. Make sure your program is actually running.\n\nAnyway, now you can start breaking down these functions individually. Let's focus on the input parsing. This is where we should start asking questions like, \"how do we know which file to read?\", \"what is the format of this input file?\", \"how should we store the data that we read?\". Immediately, we have some information to figure out and some decisions to make.\n\nFor the first question, let's assume that we want to prompt the user for the filename (as opposed to passing it in as a parameter to the program, like using argv in Python). For the second, let's assume that the input file is a plain text file that stores each data entry on a new line, and each line contains a username, first name, last name, and email address, delimited by commas. This type of information should be provided to you by your professor/manager/client/lead developer/someone else. The third question is more of a personal preference, and this is where your knowledge of data structures becomes important. You should base it on what's efficient and easy to maintain, but there are often many correct approaches, so do whatever makes the most sense to you. Let's keep things simple and store the data in an array of tuples for now.\n\nSo, thinking about this logically, in order to parse the input file, we need to:\n\n1. Prompt the user for a file (what should we do if it doesn't exist?)\n2. Read each line of that file, and for each line:\na. Split the line using a comma as the delimeter\nb. Clean up the data (if necessary) and build a tuple with it\nc. Append that tuple to the array\n\nYour program might look something like this now:\n\n\n    def parse_input_file():\n        parsed_data = []\n        input_file = prompt_input_file()\n        if exists(input_file)\n            for line in input_file.readlines():\n                data_tuple = build_tuple_from_line(line)\n                if data_tuple:  # make sure data exists\n                    parsed_data.append(data_tuple)\n        return parsed_data\n\n\nAnd now that we've decided to give this function a return value, we can go back and update the main function:\n\n\n    def main():\n        parsed_data = parse_input_file()\n        if parsed_data:  # make sure data exists\n            update_data_files(parsed_data)\n\n\nNote that we also defined two new placeholder functions. One of them is build_tuple_from_line() which takes as input the text from the line and outputs a tuple representing that data. If it fails to parse for whatever reason, we can return an empty tuple, and nothing will be added to the array. The other is prompt_input_file() which takes no inputs and outputs an object with a readlines() member. (There is also the exists() function, but I am assuming that one is imported.) Hopefully you have an idea now of how this might continue. You can start breaking down each function from here.\n\n\nNo matter what you're doing, you can always break it down into smaller steps. Focus on the core features and start with the parts you understand best. Leave the more complicated parts as abstract functions until you're ready to get into the weeds. You might find along the way that you took an inefficient approach, but it's almost always better just to get something that works to begin with, then you can always go back and optimize later. Like I know the approach I just laid out is very inefficient with memory. If you know that will be a concern, then this would be the perfect time to make adjustments before things get too complicated.\n\n\nThat got way longer than I anticipated, but hopefully it's somewhat helpful. I'm not an expert by any means, but I've seen some decent success as a programmer, and this is the approach that works best for me. Best of luck in your journey! Hope you become a kickass developer someday!",

        "body": "At the beginning I often struggled with translating e.g. homework tasks into code. I then read a beginner programming book which has used C#. The programming language isn't important as the first two chapters were the most relevant for me. The first chapter talked about why you want to learn to program, what possible fields of work are there.\n\nThe second one was about algorithmic thinking. In general most programming language  \nare built on 3 concepts:\n\n\\- Sequence (A sequence of actions that are executed in order of their appearance)\n\n\\- Branching (Actions are executed based on certain conditions)\n\n\\- Repetition (repeating an action until a condition is met. loops and recursion are different  \nforms of repetition)\n\nMost lectures only present you the synthax of e.g. an if-statement or of a loop in a certain language. But they don't tell you when to use these parts of the language. In the book they were talking about looking for keywords in the text or the requirements.\n\nFor example: If you see the word \"if\" in a text then it is a strong indicator for branching  \nas \"if\" implies there are at least two options to handle. \"As long as\" might be an indicator for a loop. If there are many separate actions mentioned one after each other it is a strong indicator for a sequence of actions that you have to perform to reach a certain goal. For each of the actions you could write one single program instruction or a function to group multiple connected instructions in one place.\n\nIn the book they give examples like opening a door where you execute an algorithm to achieve your goal. The sequence can't be changed as you can't enter the room without opening the door. In programming you have to think about which steps have to be performed first in order for your code to solve a problem.\n\npressDoorHandle()\n\nopenDoor()\n\nenterRoom()\n\ncloseDoor()\n\nOf course this is easy when you get university homework as most of the time they try to tell you as accurate as possible what you should do. If talking to a client you actually have to find out what the requirements even are.\n\nOf course this is programming on a micro-level as we are dealing with the specific steps but you can apply this also on higher levels of abstractions when you describe how a user e.g. interacts with a system like a website when he e.g. creates an account, deletes a post.\n\nWhen programming I often use pen and paper or I write comments (pseudo-code) like this:\n\n\\# For each pdf-document do:\n\n\\# Open pdf-document\n\n\\# Extract values with a regular expressions\n\n\\# write them into table\n\n\\# close document\n\nAfter writing the pseudo-code I add the real code below the comments. This way I can focus on solving the problem without having to delve into the specifics of the programming language that I use (this is something you can google easily).\n\nThere are more tips about thinking techniques for problem solving but I have to go do groceries now:)). Feel free to ask any questions. Good luck!\n\n  \nEDIT: Book recommendation: Thinking like a programmer by Spraul it's a book on problem solving techniques. It uses C++ but this isn't important. Use any language you want. It's more about understanding the concepts rather than the language.",

Code that tries too hard to separate every little thing into a function is often much more taxing to read. It depends what you're writing. Long functions aren't intrinsically bad. Minor idealism.\n\nIn 7, avoiding unnecessary assignment is fine and can be very beneficial, but this is getting into the functional realm a bit. In other styles/paradigms, and in practice, assignments are often done for readability where there wouldn't otherwise be a need to create a local to hold temporary state for the computation. Again, depends how general you're looking to be with these rules. Same with 8. Lots of useful functions will never be deterministic. E.g. a function that timestamps something couldn't be considered good here. This works fine for canned computation but can break down in real software.\n\n9 also has lots of exceptions. There are many reasons you may want an infinite loop and you rely on them often without realising. Yes, you probably don't want to write one very often in general application dev. It's more important that infinite loops don't block event loops, UI threads, don't spin-lock (unless you intend) a core, and that when errors occur in code that runs as part of the loop, they're handled properly (e.g. recovery if possible/desired) or the process exits, or device is reset etc. Sometimes there is no useful work to do outside of a loop, the whole program is a big loop, etc.\n\nI'd add:\n\n\\- Function is necessary and worth the extra code. Compilers are pretty good at inlining but that doesn't help me reading the code. E.g. You rarely need to pull a single operation into a function (e.g. n << 1) or something. Just write it in place.\n\n\\- Function interface is fully documented. This includes types of inputs/outputs, and full details of any possible exceptions (and their types), behaviour on error, error codes etc., what behaviour is defined/undefined for given states. Reentrancy (if it isn't, e.g. stores state elsewhere!), thread safety (if it isn't). Locks it will take on resources etc...\n\n\\- Function output params are reasonably obvious too (not just input params).\n\n\\- Function code is all roughly the same level of abstraction. E.g. a syscall (or C library call for a syscall) in the middle of some UI object method that handles a button click would likely be unexpected...",

Yes, controlling your side effects are important, but unless you're working in a functional language, things like printing and logging can be ignored 99% of the time, and the better visibility you gain into how your code functions is well worth it. If you're working in object oriented, sometimes you need a void method that operates via side effects, and that's okay. Not everything makes sense to have an output.

Although the main way to control for maintainability and correctness should actually be the testsuite.\n\nSure we can observe various attributes that functions tend to have in a maintainable and largely correct codebase. And I think you hit some good points, but for many of these points I would actually say there is a 80%/20% or 90%/10% rule, etc.  \nFor example, X% of functions should be deterministic and Y% should be non-deterministic. And X% of functions should always terminate and Y% should loop forever.\n\nFor example, when using the actor model, it is expected and useful to have exactly one forever-looping function (with exception of its shutdown mechanism) per actor. It would make sense to have all the other functions guaranteed to terminate. For other paradigms, the rules should be different.  \nIn async based projects for example, it makes sense to have rules when a function is allowed to be async. Many projects make all (or most) of their functions async by default, but that actually tends to introduce unneeded complexity. Limiting stuff like this requires a bit more thought when creating the system, but saves a lot of time on maintaining, debugging, and refactoring later.",

I like being able to match what goes in with what goes out, not having to guess which method or global parameter caused an exception because, idk, wrong type or something.

Learning takes time, so you must also learn to become process-oriented by finding ways to make that time rewarding as opposed to being goal-oriented and only caring about the final outcome, because the latter gives you very little in terms of experience which is what you should be taking out of your learning journey. Yes, researching how to build everything from scratch takes a very long time in the beginning, but as you gain experience, the need to do that will diminish, you will gain intuition, and over time you will build a strong knowledge foundation that will serve you much better in the long run than the brittle thing that you will build if you keep approaching learning with your current mindset. You don't need to go any deeper than the public instruction set native to your computer as below that one can hardly call it programming, but in the beginning you should really aim at forming a strong notion of how things really work all the way down there.\n\n> My question is: How do you usually learn about the tools, libraries, or techniques that already exist, so you don‚Äôt waste time building everything from scratch? Is there a strategy or habit for this, or is it just experience over time?\n\nI don't. In personal projects I just learn everything from scratch, and enjoy the whole process, because the point is to learn, not to finish the project, and the time spent learning isn't really wasted time. As a beginner to some technology there's also a very high chance that my first approach to solving the problem will likely be a mess so it won't be of much use, so that's never my goal. Lastly it's also very likely that, in the research process required to actually learn how things work, I will come across existing projects that already do it right, but instead of cheating my way by just taking advantage of the existing solution I go down the rabbit hole and try to wrap my head around the rationale of that solution, and don't consider the problem solved until I successfully tackle it myself.\n\nMy advice to you is to stop coming up with excuses to avoid learning when that's exactly what you should be doing. High-level development might feel rewarding to you because it gives you the impression that you are accomplishing a lot with very little, but in the end you are also only gaining a superficial experience, and without a solid foundation it's very easy for abstractions to create unexpected complex problems that you lack the intuition to solve on your own, so don't cheat your way out of the learning process. With large language machine learning models you have free access to teachers that can easily break down complex concepts for you and never get tired of answering your requests to explain things from different perspectives, which is a commodity that I didn't get to enjoy during most of my career, so definitely take advantage of that, not to write your code ant cheat your way out of problems, but to truly help you wrap your head around the solutions.",

You go through the steps of installing Python which is good. You explained why you need to say `python -V` with a capital `V` because, frankly, a lowercase and uppercase V look similar. I think the only other part you could have added is to make sure there's a space after `python` and no space after the minus sign.\n\nThe text editor part feels rushed. For example, you choose to use PyCharm. There's an installation process for that as well, which you skipped. Then, how does one get PyCharm to run the right version of Python.\n\nYou gloss over *what* a text editor is. Why can't you use Word or Google Docs to write a program? You could say an IDE is a text editor plus a lot more, but we won't get into the details.\n\nThere is the idea of writing code, then running code, and while you do write and run code, it might make sense to explain the process more explicitly.\n\nThere are questions left unanswered or partly answered.\n\n* What is a programming language?\n* What is a program?\n* How do you write a program? (Explain what a text editor is and the first step is to edit your code)\n* What does it mean to run a program and how do you run a program?\n\nThe part that starts to get rushed (because you wanted to do this in \"10\" minutes) is the actual Python code itself.\n\nI feel the entire section could have been slowed down. As a former teacher, it went over concepts quickly. I know the basics *seem* easy, but they aren't that easy. Even simple stuff like \"what is a variable\". What does it mean to assign a variable? What is a conditional? What is a condition?\n\nOf course, at this pace, it would not be a ten minute video. This is the problem with teaching really introductory programming. You end up explaining stuff that seems really obvious to you, but you discover that those things are *not* obvious. They're so obvious that you don't even mention it because you can't imagine someone wouldn't get it.\n\nBut still, really well edited. For what you intended to do, it looks great. Whether it gets someone to learn enough Python in ten minutes, I'm not sure. I believe a few will get it, but most might be lost?",

That one skill, the ability to read and write code is a big chunk of what makes a good programmer.\n\nNow why students tend to struggle with this is because, firstly this is actually hard to do, so they tend to cheat and just do lots of copy and paste, telling themselves they are learning.\n\nBut there are no shortcuts. To get good at programming requires being good at reading and writing code and that can only be learned by typing in all the code by hand and then trying to understand what was typed. And this requires weeks if not months of repetition (i.e. write lots and lots of code).\n\nAnd you don't need to go looking for some magic project to code. Stick to the basics and learn to write for loops, if statements, control statements, functions and procedures, read user input, echo that input, read for file, write to a file, access a database, read from a socket, write to a socket, spawn a process, capture its output etc. etc.\n\nAnd even using AI should not be an issue, but if all you are doing is using the AI code directly you will not be learning anything. If you use AI take the code it writes and type all of that code in by hand, then study the code to understand what it is doing. No copy and paste, no shortcuts.\n\nUsing that process you will be learning to write code and learning to read code.

Formulate an idea for a small and simple project, even something as simple as Hangman, Tic Tac Toe, or even \"Guess the Number\".\n\nWrite down the parts you need, players, board, etc. Write down the \"game rules\" - how the game is played. Write steps to take. Be as detailed as possible. Develop your idea. Develop the requirements. Once you have a clear picture, start developing each of the individual parts, the preparation (setup), the start, each game round, the winning/losing conditions, etc. Again be very detailed.\n\nOnce you have your \"master plan\", start programming. \n\nThe trick to get out of the tutorial phase is to drop the notion to use tutorials for  everything and instead jumping into the water and trying things on your own. Surely, you will struggle, but that's part of the learning.\n\nKeep going, make more difficult, larger projects, rinse and repeat.\n\nI will still suggest *one* book: \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul - this book could be a game changer for you as it is more about the process before the code than about the actual code. The book uses C++, but that's completely irrelevant.",

If you are high up enough in the project (as in someone people depend on) then arrange specific windows (2 hours in the morning, 2 hours end of day, for instance) that you are available for questions. the rest of the time only switch it on when you have questions to other people. \n\nTake time to read documentation. Like literally block a few hours and do the reading. It's work just like typing code is work. \n\nClose your AI tabs. Writing code, especially code that you know the structure of, is a restful activity that lets your mind go through the project. letting something generate your code makes it harder to know what is going on in the project and it pushes you into constant \"debug someone elses mess\" territory. ownership of code starts with having written it. And since it takes time, this time you can spend on thinking how you would like to fit this into the project.\n\nAlso don't feel bad about starting code over after having tried something out. \n\nI keep separate browser windows open, each with their own tabs. one window has all my testing work (pages where I try out the application, pages where I have data I need to enter like test creditcards and the like, or the jira issue I am currently working on. (open in new tab is essential when you use jira, the new interface is a laggy POS))\n\nAnd focus on the one task. If someone comes to you with an extra problem / a new problem: that is unfortunate for them that they have this problem. It is however, not your problem. Don't context switch until you are finished with what you are working on. If something is important enough to drop everything then it is simply a matter for the person interrupting you to talk to your manager __and__ the person whose ticket you are working on. They can arrange with them that you drop their task. Often this is enough of a roadblock that they are willing to wait.

Also do the assignments laid out in there and make sure to utilize ai if you need things to be clarified with things you dont understand in the book.\n\n\nThe link is in archive.org, its for free. try to find it there, and you can download pdf version of it too",

Research on your own and start somewhere. For your level and usecase it should be something cheap/free without the possibility of draining your life savings if you make a mistake. Look into a VPS and docker  \n\\- Scaling? A lot of the things in the cloud these days autoscale in their own ways. But don't worry about this at all atm. You won't build anything that needs serious scaling for a long time probably.  \n\\- Security? This one is kinda the odd one out. Security is a CORE part of any app, not just an afterthought. Another reason why you are not \"fairly proficient\". This needs to be understood and studied on a core level.  \n\\- Architecture? This can mean anything  \n\\- How to choose a tech stack? You are not really in a position to choose if all you know is Django. And thats also fine. Focus on Django for now. Switch up the db or some dependencies depending on your needs maybe.

You start with something small and manageable. You can then incrementally add to that. So for example you build a simple application, then host it, extend it to use authentication and integrate with something like google.  Add something like accessing a database and learn how to deploy the database.  This is just an example of how to build out what started as a simple application.\n\nThe first time you do something, it may not be the best, but you will learn.  The next time you can try changing things to compare until you find a method that works for you.  There is no magic formula; there are good practices and standards which you will pick up as you explore, but ultimately, you need to develop what works for you.",

Stumbling into friction, problems, and headaches makes it incredibly easy to ask more specific questions and search for a deeper understanding, as opposed to just following a guide. A great way to write programs is to solve problems you run into.\n\nFor instance, I work at a printer dealership. The software we use for tracking service tickets is 26 years old, takes several minutes to boot up, is insanely expensive, and is unintuitive and generally clunky. Maybe I'm audacious, but I became convinced I could do better. So now I'm writing a tool that does it better. It's been months and I'm nowhere near done, because I keep learning and refactoring and learning and refactoring... which is how I hit my stride. I write something, I go \"man, this sucks. maybe there's an easier way...\" and then I find an easier way. That's how you learn.\n\nOnly exception here is security.

It calls your code, at well-defined points,  allowing you to customise functionality whilst it handles common things for you. It drives, your code is along for the ride.\n\nGame engine - Basically a framework for making games. It drives. It allows you to provide code that uses or conforms to certain interfaces to customise its behaviour to make your game. Types, events, utilities, all the hard physics math, all the hard graphics math, all the finicky parsing code for data formats, the platform layer that takes input and interfaces with the OS, etc... all done for you.\n\nSDL describes itself as a library, and I agree having used it extensively. You bring the game/sim loop, and basically everything else. You call it to get input, or ask about events, or render something (if you're using it to render). It's basically a cross-platform platform layer that you can build a game engine (or whatever you like) on top of. It doesn't ask you to write your whole app in various callbacks in a very opinionated way etc.",

        "body": "Let's first define what inversion of control (IoC) is so people can understand why this is a good definition for frameworks (if you ever used one).  \n\nThe best analogy I have ever read for IoC is a breadboard that one uses in an electronics project.  The easiest example of a breadboard is one with a single input of DC current and a ground, aka a simple circuit.  Along the path of the current you can add devices to split it, devices to merge it, devices to redirect or terminate it, or devices to do something like making a beep sound.  We can think of the point where we apply the current as input and the ground as output but it doesn't matter because you can think of the ground just another device that kills the current while doing something else.  The key is the input.  \n\nWhat a framework is someone giving you a breadboard with all the wiring done for you and telling you that you have device A, B, C, etc. that can do X, Y, Z respectively and the final result is G (ground).  \n\nThis is how many JS web frameworks work, the circuit is designed for you with a few switches here and there but your primary job is to insert your devices at various spots (aka put in hour data and code).   The point is all the logic is worked out for you so you can just ***plug and play***.  \n\nA library is more like an auto-mechanic's toolbox.  It is a set of tools (or APIs) that are related for accomplishing a set of related tasks.  A good example of this in JS is JQuery.  They are typically very specific uses and very tiny.  You have to know each tool in the box well to really make it shine.  SDL is a library because it mainly provides a thin layer allowing you to manipulate the hardware through an abstraction layer.  \n\nA game engine is a very complicated IoC with a bunch of tools in a library that allows you to manipulate the breadboard so to speak so that you can write your own breadboard logic.  Of course it also has something like SDL for controlling the hardware.  \n\nIn general, unless you are paid to do something using either a framework or an engine, you should avoid wasting time on them.  They are hard to generalize and hard to learn because you have to learn the underlying rules and logic.  Learning them is like learning how the internal of Window works just so you can use a browser on your computer.  You should aim to learn through libraries and the smaller the better because then you can figure out how to write and modify them if you ever need to.",

You might only use a subset of it's functionality, and you might change libraries if one isn't working for you etc. (provided you've achieved loose coupling)\n\nFrameworks are more fundamental to your app. You won't change framework, you'll rewrite the app if you do. Think of the browser and its DOM and JS API. It handles the JS event loop, and fires events. The interface it presents you is that it will read and run your code on page load, and if you happen to attach any listeners to targets it will run your custom code when events happen on those targets. Frameworks are like this. When your problem is the problem they're built to solve everything is great, and when you need to do something bespoke, it can be very difficult unless the framework provides some escape hatch. E.g. When Angular 1 was popular it had two-way binding, and you very much had to write your front end \"the angular way\" to keep everything in it's digest cycle (or whatever, it's been 10 years) or it wouldn't know state had changed etc. Digging into the same page with jquery often backfired.",

Luckily you have some test-cases already for palindromes and non-palindromes, so you can test your procedure and probably fix many bugs already.\n\nIf you want to get really \"serious\" about testing, then you can even take a break and write a separate program (not required, of course), that generates long palindromes and long non palindromes, and can use that as input to \"stress test\" your final procedure. For such a problem this is probably overkill, but for building an \"industrial strength\" library or program where there are strict performance requirements this kind of thing is often done.\n\nIn any case don't forget to test edge cases, for example is the empty string a palindrome?

Most beginner programming problems are like this, I mean really everything is like this.\n\nSo like, the way you would check if ‚Äúracecar‚Äù is a palindrome (it is) would basically be to look at the first letter and see if it matches the last letter.  And then see if the 2nd letter matches the 2nd to last letter (and of course when I say ‚Äúletter‚Äù‚Ä¶ I guess I should be saying character, if it should be able to handle anything that is technically a palindrome I guess), and then check the 3rd letter matches the 3rd to last letter and so on.\n\nIf EVERY comparison returns true, then the result is true (it is a palindrome).  If the you ever get a false at any point, you immediately return false, because that proves it isn‚Äôt a palindrome.\n\nYou could of course have to handle all the little details, and make sure invalid things never happen.  So like you have to set up the loops correctly to not get any out of bounds error on the string you‚Äôre working with.  And also you could notice things like how you only have to check half of the word, because you‚Äôre checking the first half against the back half.  So setting a loop to go through the entire word would needlessly double check everything.  But you have to make sure not to mess up and only check just under half the word, so you should do half the word plus one character (just to be safe).\n\nEtc.  But yea the part you need to practice the most is the first part.  Figuring out how to actually solve the problem (forgetting about programming completely.  Like literally just figure out how to determine if a word is a palindrome by yourself, or whatever the problem is), this is generally the hardest part.  And then figuring out how to translate this solution into code (this is generally the easiest part).  And then you have to deal with making sure you‚Äôve handled all the edge cases and whatnot correctly (probably 2nd hardest part).",

All programs operate on information that exists in some form of storage, which the program instructions manipulate (read, write, modify, compare, ...) to implement solutions to the problem you're trying to solve.\n\nTherefore, understanding the data means you will understand the problem. That's a requirement to implement any solution. The actual programming work is almost irrelevant in the sense that you might as well do it on paper, or on a blackboard/whiteboard, etc. Only the implementation is language-dependent, but the problem itself isn't usually - unless it's an artificial problem introduced by limitations of the system, programming environment, libraries, tools, etc.\n\nUsing your palindrome example: What is the actual problem? Well, what is the data? Presumably, you're given a string of text. You assume it has some known encoding, probably ASCII (or Unicode), so that there is a specific number for each letter/code point. There's also the notion of a position because the words ABC and CBA are not identical. A position is just another number that represents where in the word the letter (represented by the first number) actually should appear.\n\nOK, so what is a palindrome? Well, it's a word (sequence of numbers + position) that just so happens to not change if you swap two letters that have the same \"distance\" from the beginning and end. But if positions are numbers and distances are required, can't you just use the absolute position for each letter (from *both* sides) and check that it's the same, for every letter? Sure, that is probably one solution - though it may not be what you need, or too difficult to do in a given programming language. Another approach is to just swap the entire word, and check that both versions are the same. This is simpler to understand but arguably less efficient.\n\nYou may have special cases, where the word has an odd number of letters. What now? Well, one basic way is to add conditionals, like \"if it's odd, do this. If even, do that\". Often it pays to think harder and realize, in this case, that it makes no difference - the same algorithm \"just works\" and so you need not complicate your solution. If the problem is too difficult, remove special cases. In code, you can write `assert` or similar or even just a `TODO` comment, then revisit that part later.\n\nA solution is different from its implementation in code. If you can't solve the problem that's an entirely different issue than not being able to implement the solution (\"write the code\"), or writing complicated/slow/insecure/incorrect code, for that matter. How do you solve problems? By transforming data, one step at a time.",

However, you're just stuck when you try to write a program on your own. It means you lack practice so can't advance because you can't get started to begin with.\n\nAlright, try this...\n\nFirst step: exercises.\n\n1. Go to [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)\n2. Pick the language of your choice\n3. Finish all exercises. At least try to make 75% progress. By the time you hit that, you should have built some mild muscle memory as well as some creativity and rigor. Believe me you're gonna need all that when you tackle the second step.\n\nSecond step: \"build your own X\"\n\nThe FREE way:\n\n1. Go to [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)\n2. Pick an interesting stuff to build (e.g. Emulator > C > \"Writing a game boy emulator\")\n3. Follow and complete the introductory tutorial and try to expand with more features\n\nThe paid way:\n\n1. Create an account on [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io)\n2. Pick a challenge (e.g. \"Build an interpreter from scratch\")\n3. Pick a language (e.g. C)\n4. Follow the instructions\n\nIt's 30$ per month though, so you gotta be committed asf and make the most of it: don't just blindly complete the challenges or worse: slack off. Read docs, engage in the community, get your project reviewed by someone, make sure you thoroughly understand the tool you just built (beyond the source code that you write).\n\nThird step: personal projects\n\nSurely there are plenty of things you want to do... If nothing comes to your mind right now, then hopefully the 3-6 months you just spent on Exercism+codecrafters gave you lots of ideas. But either way, try to do something without guidance.\n\nAfter all that, try to maybe contribute your own bugfixes or features on a GitHub repo that you love. Maybe during your learning journey, you spotted a nice game engine project and you want to participate in its development. The entire world is yours to discover at this point!",

That is okay but you just need to play catch up. I suggest watching videos or following tutorials and actually practice using these tools like Git, Git Hub, Docker, etc as you mentioned but with a guide so you do not get lost. These seem hard but once you use them for a bit it gets easier. Even I struggle to understand new topics and tools but you got to push through and enjoy the grind.\n\nResources:\n\n1. After reading your post I feel this is the best resource as per the gaps in knowledge you state you want to fill. It looks like you want to get familiar with command line interfaces(CLI), Git and Git Hub(which are different things), and how node.js and Java Script programs work. I **highly recommend** [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) course(free/asynchronous) to get familiar with all these tools(Git, Git Hub, Java Script, node.js, HTML, CSS, not docker though). It is centered on web dev but since you want to get familiar with those tools and programing languages it is a great place to start. They break it down into sections with step by step on how to set up, what it is for, how to use with personal project based learning, you can ask for help on their Discord, and they provide links to additional readings.\n   1. I was also confused about Git and Git Hub less than a year ago but using The Odin Project made me understand it a lot better and why it is so useful. BTW heres an extra resource to practice Git commands after you get familiar with using it: [https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en\\_US](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US)\n2. You can also look into [CS50 on edx](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home) to practice general programming skills. It is also free and asynchronous but it has less focus on tools and more on thinking and problem solving which will only help you. They are lecture style with additional shorter videos and problem sets to solve.\n3. I see you also are a bit interested in game dev, if so follow tutorials for games on the Godot engine or even Unity or Game Maker. Anything really and do not feel bad about doing so especially if you have never used it. Of course do not just copy and paste from the video and try to take make it your own. Brackey's could be a good start but there are other great You Tube videos for game dev.\n\nI am not an expert but I would say you do not have to know everything but you have to get familiar with general tools. Of course when you get put into a project or land a job you may have to learn a new tool but if you get a sense of the generally popular tools needed for a specific project that will help you adapt.\n\nAll in all do no give up just keep going, acknowledge your lack of experience but build upon what you know and do not know.",

Do it for years and it becomes a natural way to approach problems.\n\nThis is what you do every morning when you plan out your day.

ELSE you don‚Äôt go to post office and simply add the travel time to meeting.\n\nHave other errands to run in addition to, or instead of, the post office? Similar logic, but applied to the trip to post office instead of the meeting. This introduces looping as you work back from your 10:00 and loop through your errands leading up to it.

Maybe you are just meeting a friend for a walk in the park, and it‚Äôs ok to be a few minutes late, whereas for a job interview you must be on time, and add a few minutes buffer in case traffic delays you.\n\nIt is tedious. Very tedious. Encapsulation helps with this by focusing on the smallest set of details for the immediate problem at hand.\n\nDecompose problems into manageable encapsulations and build up from there.

The users were happy, the people who wrote that trash were not. I was never able to achieve 100x RTIs, which was disappointing. One needs to develop a design and methods instinct. The computer is a machine and you need to consider what you are making it do.\n\nAt the time, the technical computing group was charging served departments for machine cycles, there was complete reorg because that model was blown up. I was challenged by my boss/idiot that the users were not using my software suite, the cpu use was so little. I took him to my desk and beat up one of the memory resident apps and did a bunch of scrolling, sorting, editing etc and pointed to a little bug in the corner of the screen showing session use of a few milliseconds. The data was in permanent swap space, memory resident in permanent disk swap space. The screen apps were actually an interface to edit and manipulate data in address space. There were no database calls which are all subroutine calls. When a app was launched the app instantly had data in its address space. All supported by an optimized library of reentrant code. Many people running several apps were supported by a single instance of the code in memory. RAM was very expensive at that point in time. There were table driven applications generators with terminal screen forms and fields. When doing some complex products built on top of this, the full screen app could be used to examine the address space of the product being developed, an optimal debugging tool. Things like optimizing pen plotters and manufacturing numerically controlled devices, minimizing pen changes and tool transit paths. In the pen plotters, overlapping line vectors were collapsed to one. Vectors were grouped into several regions which reduced pen-up excursions. The problem is that during CAD design, a component would be given a bill of material number and the bill of material in the corner would be completed. During plotting, the plotter would retrace those motions in the order of the drawing development. A hole in a part would have two or more overlapping circles, from each surface that the hole went through. So there were such challenges. The software did such operations in the background, the users did not need to run anything. My background was MechEng.\n\nI examined each code component's compiler machine code output, optimizing register use in each subroutine, especially anything data intensive. Without using files for data, I had to produce my own data sorting, printing,  select etc. My equal key stable sorting was vastly faster than the OS sorting or SyncSort. The code included terminal drivers and supported a number of different models and brands of terminals within the one code base. Everything was coded in Fortran, however I was coding in other platforms and languages as needed.",

Other than that, finish your degree with flying colors and score an internship if applicable/possible.\n\nYou‚Äôre almost done with a formal CS degree and have way more background and schooling + future schooling than most people trying to do a career change with freecodecamp do. \n\nSpeaking from personal experience, I think it‚Äôs easy to over prepare. To keep knocking out frameworks, courses, whatever, without ever getting the confidence to dive in and start building. You probably have the requisite knowledge, training, and ability to go off-piste and stop just checking boxes to check them. \n\nI‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt learn React or whatever thoroughly if it is applicable, but I am saying you are at the point where you may have more success if you start deciding for yourself what is applicable and what isn‚Äôt. And, no, it‚Äôs not supposed to feel easy and most people don‚Äôt feel confident at first :)",

For instance we could talk about electrons moving between different atoms, or we could ignore the atoms, and abstract even higher and talk about electricity flowing.\n\nIn a computer we have the software that controls the hardware, decides how the electricity flows, but it is impossible to grasp all the details - most computers have billions of transistors that can turn on and off, so we ignore the details and talk about the CPU storing numbers in memory, and performing mathematical operations on those numbers. Our abstractions steadily climb higher and higher, moving further and further from the \"world just as it is\" with it's particles and whatnot.\n\nIn programming we talk machine code, binary patterns, on the lowest level, but again we ignore the details and use higher level languages, where creating a variable hides everything that really goes on. And so on and so forth. \n\nHigher means easier to talk about, because we ignore or hide the details.",

It involves registers (fast pieces of memory living on the CPU), memory, ways to move the data from memory to registers, and to use two registers to do some math or comparison operation (or other operations). \n\nYou're limited to the actual resources. But you can hide that from the user so they think they have an unlimited number of variables. Behind the scenes, the implementation moves the data between registers and memory giving you the illusion of unlimited variables.\n\nHigher levels of abstraction let you think far away from the actual implementation, usually in a mathematical sort of way, and hide the grungy details.

But you guys have no formal school system so you only know how to count but no writing and no ***higher math***.  \n\nSo one day you discovered that it seems like each T-Rex has about 32 teeth.  He realized this because you have been keeping them in holes near the camp ground with each hole teeth from one T-Rex.  And since you do not write and do not add, every time you go out to trade with other tribes you simply dig up one whole put everything in your dino purse and go.  You know it is enough but not how many.  But now you know ***through repeating the same thing over and over*** that it is about 32 teeth.  \n\nSo a hole is 32 teeth and you reasoned a dino purse from a hole is 32 teeth, so you decided to count purses in the future and stop worrying about the teeth and the holes.  \n\nThat is abstraction:  teeth -> purses.",

I've been programming as a full stack web developer for over half a decade now, and I'd still call myself \"intermediate at TypeScript\". Recently I've been play with a lot of local, open source AI models, even though I never technically learned Python (and even though I suck at math).\n\nMy point being: It doesn't matter where you are in your programming journey, you cannot look at it like \"OMG, there's so many things to learn\". There is ALWAYS more to learn. If you spent 100 years learning one thing, you'd die before you learned \"everything about it\". So you need to just accept where you are, and push in a direction that interests you. Maybe you end up being the programmer that \"only designs buttons\" or maybe you become the programmer that \"builds entire operating systems by themself\". But if you look too far ahead in any one direction, all you'll ever see is \"more to learn\". You can't let that deter you.",

Finishing those small steps builds confidence, and over time, you‚Äôll realize you‚Äôre moving forward more than you think.\n\n33 is not old at all in tech. When you go for internships, focus less on being perfect technically, and more on how you‚Äôve dealt with problems, figured things out, and helped people in your past roles. That‚Äôs what managers like to see in interns. Internships are designed for people who are still learning. Companies don‚Äôt expect you to come in as an expert.\n\nSo I'd say apply anyway even if you feel underqualified. Build small projects that show your database skills. Keep practicing, but don‚Äôt get stuck waiting until you feel ready because you‚Äôll never feel 100% ready. The confidence comes once you‚Äôre in the role and learning by doing.

Always solve the problem on paper first.\n\nThis is slow and tedious and all sorts of difficult at first. Which is why it works.\n\nLater on, you can relax this restriction. But if you're able to solve a problem on paper, then you'll learn problem-solving. Programming consists of problem-solving (this step) and encoding the solution in code (the next one), among other things.\n\nCopying code does not teach you [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving). It doesn't even teach you the encoding step, though it may help to refresh your memory. Therefore you will not be able to learn how to solve problems, which is at the heart of programming. You likely won't improve much because you haven't practiced the relevant skills.",

I think some of them point out large numbers of imports, but for things like sonar, they just have limits on them like \"no more than x imports\". I don't know of a tool that will actively fix them for you though. Some of these scanners have code duplication detection as well, that might be a good indicator of where you can combine things or reorganize.\n\nEDIT: after some quick googling, Ndepend and DGML apparently are good tools for scanning.\n\n\\>Some way to reduce redundancy where two variables do ALMOST the same thing\n\nNot sure I know what you mean here without an example.

Having the path and following it are two completely different things.\n\nAlso, being around computers is something most people do now. Playing video games is being around a compute a lot, but just loving video games doesn't mean you'll be good at programming. To be fair, being afraid of a computer isn't great news.\n\nWhat's difficult to assess, and you won't know until you start, is how well you'll figure things out. Some people have a knack for programming even if you wouldn't expect it. Maybe they've seemed very artistic, but they also have the kind of mind to program.\n\nSo, you have three resources. The question is what do you expect from each resource?\n\nI'd probably suggest (and you'll get others, so you have to decide)\n\n* MOOC with Python (https://programming-25.mooc.fi/). Free (it's also a college course, but you won't be a student earning credits).\n* cs50p (CS50 is a set of courses offered from Harvard via edX, a consortium of universities offering college-level courses for free)\n\nYou could do those two at the same time. The goal is to get good with Python (or good enough).\n\nThen, CS50w, which gets you into web programming with Python and Flask. It's the same guys that made CS50x (which is Scratch, C, and a few other topics) and CS50p (the Python course just mentioned).\n\nCS50w covers some backend stuff.\n\nYou could use FreeCodeCamp to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript to learn some basic front-end technology. They do also have Python, but I don't think it's quite set up in a course format.\n\nOf course, someone will suggest you dive into projects, but I think it helps to know some basics before you do that. The belief is that a good project will keep your interest because you'll be interested in what you build. But that's kind of a big \"if\" (to find a project you'll be interested in that isn't impossibly difficult).\n\nAnyway, good luck. You'll have to sift through a lot of advice and decide what to do.",

Freelancing and entrepreneurial efforts are, I believe, the best route for new developers in 2025. \n\nIt's a slightly different path than the old Node and React route. Those are good tools, but they're better for teams than solo developers. \n\nI recommend using The Odin Project, especially if your interest is primarily in back end development. Try their Ruby on Rails path. Rails has been in decline for several years, but it's still a viable platform for solo development, and, more importantly, it will teach you how the back end works. Routing, models, controllers, services, ORMs,.etc. \n\nThat should serve as a solid foundation for you going forward. Python and Django, for example, will make a lot more sense if you have a Rails background. So will many opinionated frameworks. \n\nBut you're going to hear a lot of opinions based on your question. Regardless of which you choose to listen to, find your path and stick to it. Go deep before you go wide. \n\nGood luck to you.",

If the queries are taking a while, you can consider denormalizing and having a table that is literally just the most recent completion (or the next lession to suggest) so that you can fetch it more quickly.\n\nYou may also want to consider event sourcing, it's probably more complex to learn/setup the first time, but you can then retroactively apply different display logic after the fact since the events are all available to reconstruct how the currrent state was reached.  HOWEVER, if it's your first app I would just go the standard CRUD way first and maybe consider trying to do event sourcing after to compare/contrast the strengths and weaknesses yourself.",

You **can** do machine learning in any language, **but** Python is a really common interface language, **but** the actual computation behind the scenes is normally written in something like C.\n\nThe real answer is: Python is a good choice of language for beginners and it has a lot of machine learning support. After that, if your future employer wants you to use something else or your future projects require you to use something else, then be open to it. Most programming languages have similarish fundamentals anyway, so it's not time wasted - it's just adding tools to your toolkit, and once you've learnt how to use one, others will come more easily. Machine learning will also take time to learn in its own right, and learning it via a relatively easy language like Python isn't a bad choice.",

You are a beginner so its good to get experience with different tools or programing languages(obviously in the future you can specialize). Its good you have these interests and you should stick with them since that makes learning fun.\n\n1. Seeing as you like Python and want a good structured course, I would say start [CS50p on EDx](https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python). It is free, asynchronous, and you get to practice Python by solving problem sets at your own pace. The class is run by Harvard(no need to apply) with a great professor and its basically the online version of the actual class. Its beginner friendly and I highly recommend this if you want to learn more about Python. I did this course before going to college and felt it aligned well with what I learned in my Python class(make sense since CS50 is also a college level class).\n\n2. Harvard has other course under \"CS50\" like one for AI, web dev, cyber security, etc that you can do after you get more familiar with coding. These are also free and you can check them out here: [https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan](https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan)\n\n3. You also say your like web dev so I definitely suggest checking out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)(also free). This one more self learning you need to read about each topic on your own, but the content is curated(I am doing this and like the resources they provide so far). As for content the course goes over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and in the advanced course more web dev tools like node.js or ruby(there are 2 advanced courses, choose a path you like).\n\n4. You can stick with the FreeCodeCamp¬†course as well, that is a good course and you should keep doing it. As you said \"like it better as there is more involvement and actual coding\" this is great that you get to do more hands on stuff.\n\n5. W3 schools is alright, you are definitely right to think the problem is you are just reading but are not applying any of the things you learn. As many people have said you learn by doing aka projects even if they are small or simple. The important part is you thought about what to type out and learned something during the process.",

To explain, CS50p will cover these topics week by week for 10 weeks aka 10 online lectures:\n\n1. functions,\n2. variables,\n3. conditionals,\n4. loops,\n5. exceptions cases,\n6. using libraries,\n7. unit tests file I/O,\n8. regular expression,\n9. Object-Oriented Programming & classes,\n10. recursion.\n\nThis is more about applying little programming technique week by week. Each week has a few problems to solve using and expanding on the skills you learned up to that point. These of course are not full projects, but still very good practice to learn skills in a controlled and friendly environment. They test problem solving skills as well which never hurts.\n\n# The Odin Project:\n\nThis has excellent projects and to clarify The Odin Project is for front end and back end. It has an introduction course teaching HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Then you can choose to learn ruby or node.js or both and these advanced course are at least 5-8x longer than the introduction course so plenty to learn.\n\nThe structure is:\n\n* You basically read a few curated lessons and external resources\n* Make a project which is a website such as:\n   * Basic HTML page\n   * Landing page with styling\n   * Making web page games or interactive pages after learning Java Script\n   * Even more advanced pages after learning more tools\n* This cycle of reading and making projects repeats itself. They have a discord to help you if you get stuck, but the course is pretty detailed/clear. Essentially there are many chances to make projects and if you feel comfortable you can make your own outside of the course.\n\nThis is heavily project based as you are given a general goal when you reach a project assignment. Other than that you just make your own website following the general theme or requirements. This is also self graded but with web dev its pretty easy to see how well you did by viewing your website based on content, design, and functionality. You also get to learn about version control through Git and Git Hub. This is great since now you projects will be on a repository that you can make public or private as you wish. Furthermore you can actually see your website live and deploy it. For the beginner course they just make these websites hosted on Git Hub, but in the advanced course they show others ways of hosting and using more advanced tools.\n\nIf you have more questions feel free to ask!",

It's the most popular, with the biggest community and most resources online.\n2. Go with node.js (express.js) in the backend.\n\n**4. Pick a bigger project (not huge) which you have passion for. Passion is important, because it keeps motivation high.**\n\n1. Examples: Full browser game, your own small social media web app\n2. Don't overthink just start building to the best of your knowledge.\n3. If you are stuck, ask google, or reddit.\n4. Maybe you have to rewatch videos, or read more docs\n5. **Go to step 4.2** and repeat until your project is ready\n6.

In my honest and humble opinion,¬† Android (and jetpack compose in particular), is more pleasant and less nerve wreaking than iOs.\n\n\nCross platform: welcome to the jungle! Cross or multi platform developer is gaining in popularity,¬† mainly because management can save a buck. There's so many frameworks available out there, it's difficult to decide,¬† but here's my 2 cents:\n\n\n- no-no: Qt framework, Xamarin, Ionic, React Native. Developer experience and overall quality is plain bad.\n\n\n- maybe: Kotlin Multi Platform. It's in its early stages,¬† and rough around the edges, but I see huge potential.¬†\n\n\n- best option: Flutter. For so many reasons, let me know if you want to know more.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, they all work in the same way: your code transpiles to cpp and h, and these are compiled vis cmake. Hence,¬† you may as well create your own.¬†\n\n\nWorth mentioning: mobile development is not just \"the app\", but the release train as well:\n\n\n- github workflows\n- fastlane\n- google play, apple dev portal and store connect\n- certificates and permissions (see in app purchases, keypass auth, etc etc)\n\n\nLet me know if I can help you further.¬†\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention something very important,¬† that will help you succeed as an engineer,¬† and not just a developer: architecture. Learn as much as possible about that. Most principles con be transferred to backend development,¬† and even lower level programming.¬†\n\n\nRead other people's code. When you do it for work it's draining, but when it's not is like learning from the masters. I recently dissected Arduino CLI, for instance,¬† and I discovered a gem of clarity an structure.

Even without AI, the job was getting easier due to better tooling and specialization of SaaSes. Ie a newer architecture takes significantly less manpower to maintain even at high scale compared to old architectures. \n\nI was a VP at a startup founded around 2013. Their first product took a team of 60 engineers to maintain. Our second product, built on a more modern stack, took 6 engineers and made as much revenue and processed more scale. This led to a limited refactor of the first product which removed the hardest to maintain parts, freeing up engineers to work on new things. \n\nI'm talking simple stuff - like using SQS, lambda functions, etc. \n\nAnyways I think companies are dialling in a new cost -> revenue ratio wrt to engineering resourcing. \n\nTwitter is one extreme (but not recommended) example of this, ie everything thought it would crash and burn and yeah, there were a few pains, but overall the service stayed up with a third of the engineers. \n\nGoogle/Meta have also done a ton of reorgs, and while some of those are layoffs, a lot of them is reshuffling people to new team and new bets because less people needed to work on each products. \n\nAnyways it's all first hand thoughts and super anecdotal. I just don't see why people would go back to hiring as much as they did with the salaries as they were. It was kind of silly and frankly most people I know in FAANG were coasting pretty hard.",

Then practice those and get to a really comfortable level.  At the time of my last interview, I was writing typescript and react code daily for a side project, so I was entirely in my element.\n\nSo if it's C# that's popular, practice and level up your proficiency with C# and .NET, if it's Java, then get good with Java and Spring or whatever.  \n\nAlso, think of difficult problems you've solved or ran into in the past.  Document how you solved them, and have a good answer for this kind of question.  It comes up in pretty much every interview I've had and always opens up a conversation going into more detail, and I feel like thats the best position to be in during an interview; a discussion where you get to take the lead and control the conversation.",

He himself said he changes jobs every couple of years and doesn't have \"expert level\" (which might just be mid that he thinks is \"expert\") in any one language. \n\nThe odds seem high he's fallen into the classic trap of 6x 1YOE rather than having 6YOE? If so, then no wonder he's struggling badly in mid level interviews in this current job market. Thus this is an aspect he needs to urgently address, but we can't even get to the point of discussing how to do this, if he won't even discuss it as a possibility.\n\nEdit 2, to reply to u/Azureflames20:\n\n> I feel like if you‚Äôre someone who takes this much offense to a valid possible criticism, there‚Äôs some bigger ego issues to work on and squish.\n\nYeah I'd bet money on the fact he doesn't just have technical skills he needs to work on, but is lacking in soft skills areas as well, that are likely coming through during the interviews.\n\nEdit 3, a reply to u/mariogario123:\n\n> So why is someone who stuck around for 6 years going to be knowing more than someone who jumped every, let‚Äôs say, 1.5 years. \n\nAm certainly not saying 6yrs is the optimal time to stay at a company! (from the employee perspective... )\n\nBut if you're jumping every year or two, then do you truly get to see the full entire SDLC? And thus truly feel the ramifications of the decisions that are made way back at the start. Or are you jumping too early every time to learn the lessons? \n\nDon't think we can say there is one magic \"optimal number\", depends so much on: the person, the company, market conditions, and more.\n\nEdit 4, a reply to u/evanescent-despair:\n\n> So what should someone who‚Äôs jobless even do if they have a 6x 1YOE situation?\n\nWell, first of all they need to recognize it, as then it is easier to come up with a plan to fix it. \n\nThey might even find this realization freeing. As if you're 6YOE deep into a career, you might feel yourself \"stuck\" in it with \"golden handcuffs\" (or at least silver plated handcuffs). And you can't just give this up and take a big drop / step back into a new career instead. \n\nHowever, if you're just at 1YOE into it reality, then it's much easier to decide upon a career pivot?\n\nWhile if they *do* decide to stick with it, they need to figure out their strengths and weaknesses, so they can play to their strengths and patch up their weaknesses to at least competent mid level. \n\nBecause they need to quickly be able to \"fake\" being mid/senior level and even better in the long run *actually become* mid/senior level ability. \n\nAs likely they're coming across in interviews and their CV as someone who is *not* mid/senior and interviewers are smelling this from a mile away. And nobody wants a 6YOE Junior!",

In SCRUM meetings you're just supposed to say you did so-and-so or a single task and today you will be doing another task - so you state what that task will be. Probably if I was the manager I might wonder what are you going to be doing today? You kind of need someone in the team you are on to be a mentor to you so reach out to some of the other team members and try to become friends with them.

They take the easy way out. I had an interview just like this a month ago, it was interesting.\n\nI'm too late to the party, but here are my few comments. I am tipsy.\n\nI have been an occasional hiring manager/tech interviewer for last 15 years in companies of various sizes. From nough startups to couple of billions in current account. Disclaimer - I mostly mostly work in highly regulated backend area (gambling/fintech) as a senior/staff/principal.\n\n* In organisation of any size hiring manager has way less input into how we evaluate candidates than you would think. From the company perspective your CV requires at least a screening meeting (internal), chat with HR (yes, candidate looks promising!) and time slots from at least 2 seniors for at least 2 different meetings + EM meeting (position fit) + executive meeting (culture/ambitions fit).\n\n* * We cannot spend time on every single candidate. You really are asked to stand out to proceed, cost of hiring you approaches $100k in time commitment from everyone involved + another $100k for your onboarding. I must apologise, but that is what our in-house recruiters are responsible for.\n\n* Good companies do domain specific take home assignment with known gotchas (e.g. rounding issues, how to handle various dimensions depending on domain, performance considerations, ability to join two tables to start with, not even talking about various consistency scenarios). Yes, it sounds like unpaid work, but it is a fantastic filter between those that have a clue and those that copy paste from stack overflow. We are about to invest 12 months in you getting up to speed, we ask for 4-8 hours of you showing off your skills.\n\n* * These assignments usually are crafted with great care by rather highly paid engineers in the org. There can only be so many of them prepared, check glassdoor, it usually will spell out what you need to succeed.\n\n* LC is a good screener for 99% of candidates that couldn't code their way out of looking up data from users table. Anyone who displays awareness of constraints, different naming nomenclatures, jeez (here comes the dragons) - time zones ... or even utf8mb4 v utf8mb3... automatically a plus.\n\n* Always remember that we WANT TO HIRE YOU! Seriously! We wouldn't be hiring otherwise! What seems to be a field of obstacles is not meant to discourage you, but to make sure you get a face time with your peers whose opinion will really count. Please accept that if my week is 40 hours and every day i have 2 hours blocked for hiring (with 15 minutes before each meeting to research candidate background, 15 minutes afterwards to summarize my notes and provide feedback all while actually moving business forward...) Executive or EM discussion fail can very easily be overriden if 2 actual team members says \"5 stars, he/she/they will fit GREAT\".\n\n* Candidates should and will be treated equally. Ignoring cases where candidate had a nervous breakdown during interview (has happened, more than once. it's not a showstopper, it's a stop-the-interview and reschedule to start from tabula rasa. One of the few things big tech gets right is to dismiss outlier incidents), we do need to show that we care about results, not about gender, race, etc. And we are pretty objective about it. Except positive bias.\n\n---\n\nAs for your specific comment that most managers are bad. I used to think the same until I became an engineering manager. There's so fucking much politics and shoulder playing between teams and horse trading to just move ahead with the project that is our job to shield you from.\n\nYes, you think your ticket with specification and acceptance criteria is done and easy and you can just proceed. 50% of the time that feature is actually under a chopping axe because someone else in the company wants to take eventual credit for it / is unable to formulate where their API points are expected to be / knows that you are doing null work that will be discarded because corporate strategy has separate team working on replacement. Sucks, but not due to you and not due to your EM.",

I conducted over a dozen last month.\n\nFor the record, our interviews include some discussion with the candidate on their experience, a leetcode type question, and some system design. The leetcode question is not meant to be difficult, and we use something that is classified as easy or homegrown stuff that is similarly quite easy. One question we often use, for example, has a very trivial n^2 solution (literally try every pair of values and make sure the index of j is after i).\n\nWhen I am conducting interviews everything matters. It's not just a black and white do you solve the question and I check off the box. Here's a list of some things that I am looking at to make a decision that aren't just \n\n* How quickly do you start solving and how quickly do you solve it? Does it look like you've seen the question before? Does it look like someone else or AI is solving the question for you?\n* How well can you articulate what your solution is and how it works? Do you articulate what your approach to the question is before you write code or after?\n* If you run into problems, what do you do for debugging? Are you reading the error logs? Are you printing things to see?\n* If you are struggling with the question, do you ask questions? What kind of questions do you ask? How long does it take for you to ask a question when you're stuck?\n* Our question has one common pitfall (which is honestly quite obvious). Do you fall for this? If you do, when I explain what is happening, can you pick up on where you fell into that pitfall? Do I have to explain it very explicitly or can you pick it up?\n* Can you even code? Do you run into basic syntax problems? Do you know what help to ask me for on the syntax issues? Does it look like you barely even know how to code?\n* Are you cognizant of the time we have and what our expectations are?\n* I specifically ask the candidate two follow up questions every time the answer is solved: what is the runtime complexity and is your solution optimal. This helps me figure out what kind of more formal education the person has (because all of us remember studying big O notation, right?). This also helps me figure out if they're capable of scrutinizing their own code. It also helps me see how they tackle a problem that may not have an obvious answer (or even one at all).\n\nDon't conduct an interview with a question that doesn't have a purpose. In fact, don't do things that don't have at least half a dozen purposes. Everything I do has a purpose and helps me evaluate it. I have absolutely no problem letting you sit in silence for 10 minutes as you mumble to yourself about your solution, it will help me see how you think. Heck, if you want to sit there in silence and write no code and ask zero questions it will show me how collaborative you want to be (and I explicitly mention they're welcome to ask me questions, even to ask for help). I very intentionally do not use difficult questions because I very intentionally want to measure other things. I could care less if you remember how to invert a binary tree or the difference between Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms or any of that mumbo jumbo that, as you point out, will never be useful on the job. I do care if you can reason your way through something new and present a working solution, even if it means asking someone for help.",

Chat GPT 5 is the first sign of an AI regression as these companies have to pay the piper and try to actually turn a profit. Shareholders are finally starting to ask \"so uhhh... When is AI gonna make money?\". Meta is paying several millions of dollars for individual AI researchers. Warren Buffet liquidated over a billion in shares and is holding cash. *Nvidia alone accounts for 7.3% of the entire S&P 500*, which is insane.\n\n\nThere are a dozen signs from employment to inflation that were already in a recession. The current administration's desperation to lower interest rates shows they know somethin bad is about to happen, and they're firing anyone who threatens to break the dam by being honest about the numbers (e.g. the Labor Bureau head).\n\n\nSo it's gonna get worse. It's going to get a lot worse... And then it will get better. But, there's signs this is going to be the big one. The president controlling the Federal reserve threatens to cause hyper inflation. Our debt to GDP ratio restricts our ability to print money and bail out failing companies. I think we're really going to struggle to spend our way out of this one, because foreign interests aren't buying our debt.\n\n\nSo my advice is pay down debt. Save aggressively if you can. Maybe don't take out any big loans, and probably don't quit if you've got a job. Probably get out of that door dash habit, and tighten up your subscription services. Well bounce back, but I really think it's going to be a rough couple of years¬†",

CS is kind of in a perfect storm environment. I think we are in the early stages of a recession, combined with us having high interest rates and over hiring in pandemic has made the job market really tough for entry level talent. I don't think tis going to get better in 1 to 2 years.  \n\n\nHowever, what I do think is that tech and CS is not going way. My personal educated guess is that there will be new types of roles emerging that will be more like product person + roles. Essentially where you would be expected to do project managing plus software development with AI tools. \n\nI don't think software engineering that requires extensive OOP experience  are going anywhere.  I think AI is going to make certain areas of tech explode that people aren't thinking about enough today. The biggest one is I think cyber security, fraud detection etc.  The thing is the tools that tech has pushed the last ten years (AI, Crypto,  Payment servies like cash apps) are eco systems that have encouraged sophisticated criminal activity and thats only going to grow. That also means the opposite is true jobs meaning to minimize fraud risks, protect data are probably going to grow.\n\nPeople talk about AI automating jobs, but most of the people doing the talking have never even sat in a labor economics or macroeconomics course. AI is the type of technical innovtion that compliments the skills of some workers and replaces the skills of others. USually what these type of technologies replace are repetitive tasks. So the more your job is doing the same repetive task (i.e. generating the same reports/analyitcs over and over again) the more likely that job is replaced by AI. This is why I think the future is being more in the product type roles (which are the ones getting laid off the most). However, these jobs will evolve into something like product + software, instead of just product,\n\nI also think the industries in general are going to reward people who think outside fo the box and push creative boundaries. AI is very good at creating simple designs. I think any company that is relying on AI to be the drive for their innovation will probably fall behind in the long term.",

AI, outsourcing, and a glut of talent mean that people who went to decent schools for a CS degree, which would have been a sure bet ten years ago, will now flounder in the job market.\n\nThe days of being an average, generalist CRUD app or devops developer and pulling good money are gone. Only established people and the 10x devs will survive, and they will earn bigger paychecks than ever. \n\nTech as a field will continue to grow, and there will be ways to profit immensely from it. However, simply being a decent developer in a certain tech stack is no longer sufficient to stand out. Sure, some people will get lucky and land good roles, but that's what it is: luck (but they will still delude themselves when they come on this sub and call it hard work).\n\nI like to compare it to the DBAs of the first dotcom bubble. Tons of companies had large in-house IT teams and DBAs who made good money. The rise of cloud services and MSPs made them less relevant. Obviously there are still jobs in that industry, but it is more competitive and less lucrative today.

I was nearly down-leveled over a Karot interview which happened in the first week of studying LC in a new language, Java. With a slow interview process, I was able to get up to speed on all the other parts, and by the time I got to a a hiring manager I felt pretty good. Now I'm a team lead at that job, lol.\n\nThe biggest difference, is that to be successful today, versus in 2020, is that companies are being a bit more picky. Whether that's judging pedigree/experience with more scrutiny, or making the interview process longer and involving more steps with higher bars.\n\nEither way, making a step up is very much possible, but you'll likely have to learn the interview process and invest time into the various skills: pitching yourself, LC (or whatever knowledge base is required for ML), systems design (esp. LLM serving, ML systems), and finally behavioral.\n\nPersonally, I'll jump in about 18 months if I don't make Staff and can't switch orgs, and I'm planning about a 6 month period of interview prep, some LC, lots of sys design, and really focus on behavioral. I'm definitely a corporate-type, neoliberal and process-based thinker, and if you can lean into that it really helps.",

Your question, taken at face value, makes no sense. Why would an employer willingly choose a candidate with less demonstrated experience? The answer to this question is \"get more experienced\".\n\nI say this as someone who entered the industry in my 40s, with no CS background, no college, no bootcamps, no professional contacts in the field. \"How do I get hiring managers to consider me?\" was a question I asked myself, fruitlessly, for years. But as a hiring manager now, I get it. Why would I have considered me? And even if I have a disposition to consider more oddball candidates, given my background, there's still an ATS and a literal army of recruiter between me and our candidate pipeline, so I really never even get to see candidates who are oddball. Those are filtered out long before the candidate is talking to me.\n\nI'm interested to hear what other people here will say. I'm sure there are other ways to skin this cat. But the solution I settled on was to change my approach and expectations. I stopped applying for SWE and started applying to roles that were adjacent to, or had some plausible path to, where I wanted to be. I had zero impressive experience you could put on a resume, so I had to start far away, in (non-technical) customer support in my dream company. If you have some impressive experience but not impressive enough for a SWE role, you might consider something like Solutions Architect if you're more into operations, or some kind of Data Analyst role if you spike on the SQL/mathematical/statistical side.\n\nFind companies you think would be good to work for, and start looking through their open roles. Don't limit yourself to only the specific role you think you want next (and for which 100% of employers are ghosting you on).\n\n\\*Sure maybe once in a blue moon this happens for mostly unique or at least impractical reasons (\"candidate has 200k followers on Twitter and a strong social media brand as a SWE influencer\", \"candidate is a maintainer on some piece of OSS that is important to us\", etc), but by and large it's not a thing.\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Also my answer is calibrated specifically for your situation: breaking into the industry.

Normally, hiring folks out of university is seen as an OK investment. The hiring pipeline assumes that for every university hire, maybe 80% of them leave (voluntarily or otherwise) before 5 years. Those 80% give you workhorses that aren't exactly cash cows, but keep the business running. The folks who stay on long term tend to be high performers who carry onward business knowledge.\n\nIt's no longer acceptable to just have an \"OK\" investment from the budgeting process. I've been involved in presenting proposed bodies of work all the way up to the CFO of a F500. Effectively, the view from executive management is that every project needs to be a home run out of the park in order to get approval in the current environment. That means you need to staff it with experienced people who already know the business domain, and can execute quickly without any hand holding - because the promised timelines  to executives are aggressive. I've directly been told by middle management to \"accelerate\" certain projects because other initiatives got approved, and that meant ripping our existing juniors off and re-staffing them on other work.\n\nThat means as an engineering manager, that you no longer want to hire juniors. There is really nothing you can do - because the roles don't exist in certain companies now. The only thing that will fix that are lowered interest rates, or you try to apply for companies which aren't cash strapped. That inherently means AI or crypto companies at the moment, which in themselves will have stability issues.",

I am convinced that \"this market\" is the way it is because of companies being shitty like this rather than because of natural \"market forces.\" Leadership turmoil is absolutely everywhere and for example in my last two positions, the head of engineering was fired within a few months of joining both times. To me it's dumbassery and not some vague idea of a market.\n\n\nThe thing with playing leadership Russian roulette is that it creates chaos, and company culture ends up in flux, and you simply don't know what company you're really joining. The company may not resemble the one you heard about in interviews simply because they cleaned out the leadership either during your application process or early in your job there. It's frustrating and it can practically nullify your \"reverse interview\" efforts.\n\n\nI would say this is a red flag for the company and you should think long and hard about working there. This experience is the smoke, and you'll likely discover the fire once you join up.",

I've spent 2 years doing nothing but maintaining and fixing old Java code and 2 years of writing new code and do a mix in general.\n\nI can tell you that after being in Java space for over 10 years, I'd recommend C# more. Has better design decisions and didn't grow in popularity until after the late 90s internet boom so you're perhaps less likely to deal with old code with zero documentation. Sometimes I see Java repos with the Date API or Structs, both of which gave me headaches.\n\nMore people know Java so I think you have less competition for .NET/C# jobs, which aren't significantly less than Java jobs. Then Java has annoying amounts of boilerplate code, which is nice while learning the language, but that hurts you in timed coding tests. If you have to use Eclipse on the job, that gave me the most headaches of all. Visual Studio is pretty tight.\n\nIf you go Java, you also need to know Spring Boot. Easy to tell when it's in every job description. For better or worse, the whole ecosystem is tied to that framework. I like it for the most part.",

Usually, it's these:\n\n* Infrastructure/Networking\n* Application Orchestration\n* Observability\n* Internal Tools\n\nTo start, pick one to go deep into, and develop a passable understanding of the rest. You will accumulate a deeper understanding of everything over time, and gain an instinct for what you should understand (principles) and what you can discard (bitrotting technical details). Work with your manager to get projects in the specific pillar you want to gain expertise in if possible. If that's not possible, pick something else for now and come back to it.\n\nWhen you're working on stuff, take notes on things that you learn that could be helpful in the future. Do personal retros on particular projects/tasks that you struggled with and try to internalize the knowledge that you gained. This takes a lot of effort, and some of it may come after hours. That's why DevOps/SRE tends to get paid more though, so...swings and roundabouts.\n\nTotal honesty here: people will tell you that you don't need to be a hardcore techie to be successful, but if we define \"hardcore techie\" as \"someone who is really into understanding why systems behave the way that they do and is not content with just a surface-level understanding\", then not being one is absolutely career limiting in DevOps/SRE. Because of how fast the tech moves in the infrastructure space (while simultaneously breaking in ways that require an understanding of the underlying primitives - like Linux Networking), hunger and curiosity is a requirement. If I had to add another thing, it would be a deep appreciation for rigorous and disciplined engineering.\n\nAll that is to say - the amount of stuff to learn should bring you joy, not stress. If all it does is stress you out, it might be best to find a regular SWE job.",

That's why asking directly about it doesn't work.\n\nA company that demands everyone work for *only* 60 hours a week instead of 80 hours week could truthfully claim that they have a good work life balance. And they do, relative to that other company.\n\nThat, and if you're asking questions that have an objectively right answer, of course they can just lie. They know the answer you're looking for. \"Do you have a good WLB?\" --> \"Yep!\". Easy peezy.\n\nInstead, you have to ask questions about the things that in your opinion make up a good work life balance. Questions that don't have objectively correct answers.\n\nFor example, a favorite one of mine is to ask them to tell me about a time when the team was missing a deadline, and what was done in reaction. There is no \"right\" answer to that question. It's also asking about a *specific anecdote*, so people are much less likely to lie about that, and if they try it's much harder to come up with a good story-lie on the spot.\n\nIf an interviewer said something like \"The team really came together and rallied to hit the deadline despite all odds\" for example would be a good answer to some people. To me? Red flag. That means when the team gets bad deadlines, they do crunch time to make up for it. The answer *I'm* looking for is something about dialing back scope, extending the deadline, or allocating more resources. Those are green flags. That indicates management knows how to do project management 101, and developers aren't asked to work long hours to make up for unrealistic deadlines.\n\nAnother example, I like to ask about how frequent after-hours production support calls are. This gives me insight into product stability, and in turn what the on call rotation will look like.\n\nAgain, there isn't really an objectively correct answer to this question. Everyone might be looking for different answers. I remember one time I asked this question to the hiring manager, and he got this big grin on his face and said they only get called after hours 1-2 times a month. He genuinely thought that was a good thing. Maybe it is compared to a place like AWS, but what *I* was looking for was a stable product that only gets after hour calls 1-2 times ***a year***. Not a month. I politely rejected that company.\n\nThink about what makes up a good WLB *to you*. Then develop questions asking about those things.",

The reason being that your current employer might resent you for forcing their hand and look for a way to get rid of you later. I wouldn't necessarily agree with that, and have taken the counter-offer in the past without negative repercussions. I did leave that employer 6 months after taking the counter-offer when I got an even better offer, so it didn't really work out for them, but it was good for me.\n* Your compensation is on the low end for the senior SWE in a super expensive city, especially given the RTO requirement. The fact that you secured another offer, and your current employer wants to keep you, means you could likely do better.\n* Outside of compensation, there might be other benefits to working at the current company. E.g. You might get good leadership experience in the new lead role. Think about whether it might be possible to move within your current company to work under a different manager.\n* If you aren't able to switch teams while staying at your current employer, I'd probably recommend taking the other offer, based solely on the fact that you described the current team as \"quite toxic\". Hopefully the new role will be pretty chill, and you'll have time to upskill on your own, then seek out an even better offer.",

However, if you‚Äôre working alongside other Seniors and they‚Äôre not doing the level of team management you‚Äôre doing, then it might be beyond what a Senior does at your org. Similarly, are there other Leads around that you can compare with? If your org doesn‚Äôt have Leads, that‚Äôs a very different situation.\n\nThere are a lot of different implementations of this. At some places, a Lead is a line manager. Other places, you have a Tech Lead, who is essentially a particular archetype of Staff, but people stuff is handled by someone else. At some places, there‚Äôs what‚Äôs called a ‚ÄúTech Lead Manager‚Äù, which is sort of in between the two ‚Äì¬†usually they have project-level accountability and input into performance discussions, but maybe they don‚Äôt do salary review, etc.\n\nOne useful way to frame this is, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm enjoying the work I‚Äôm doing to lead (or ‚Äòhelp lead‚Äô) the team, and I‚Äôd like to talk about my growth path. How close would you say I am to being a Lead Software Engineer, and what are the areas I need to put in work to get there? Can we plan out that journey so that I‚Äôm doing the highest impact things?‚Äù\n\nBasically, it gets you a lot more information while looking really good and not coming off as a squeaky wheel. A lot of the other ways to approach this can come off as whiny / demanding, which can be totally fine, but is sometimes not fine‚Ä¶ and is often not fine for reasons that you don‚Äôt have visibility on. Framing it as about your growth gets your leadership thinking about ways to grow you lest they lose you, but in a non-confrontational way. Also, if there‚Äôs something fundamental that you‚Äôre missing, you‚Äôre better off knowing before you spend a year wondering why you‚Äôre not being promoted.\n\nDepending on your relationship with your boss / skip-level boss, that might be a good conversation to have with both of them.",

The warehouses are made for humans, so there's a lot of \"wasted\" space and energy put into lighting, climate control, space for humans to walk around, safety, human-readable labels, etc. If a robot has to dodge humans, keep them safe, and read plain-text labels, it's going to be less efficient and a lot harder to program than a dense structure that \\_only\\_ accomodates bots and works by perfectly orchestrating them from some central computer. \n\nCoding languages and our entire tech stack are built for humans in the same way. They try to bridge the gap between natural language and machine language so humans can guide the machines. That's why most devs use higher level languages even though assembly is way more efficient (if you know how to work with it). This is a huge bottleneck for LLMs, because they have to use their computer-language brain to translate your natural langauge into a programminmg language only for it to end up back as a computer language, and that's only for coding itself. IMO, \"beyond human\" programming would cut out the middleman (programming langauges) entirely and work purely on CPU instructions. Data would be densely packed and would not be human-readable, \"code\" would be pure binary, there wouldn't really be a distinction between API, Database, Frontend, etc. \n\nBasically it would look a lot like how ML \"brains\" look to us now: we can't really look at the data they're made of and trace exactly how input A leads to output B, because it's all just inscrutable math to us. We just have to give it in the input and tell it if it got the output we expect. A beyond human program would work the same way, a black box that we just test until it does what we want it to do.",

That all goes towards how affordable and scalable a codebase may be. And \"stability\" strictly from a codebase perspective (ignoring infra) is again mostly a human concept. How bug free is it, how easy is it to catch *human mistakes* that create bugs before they get released. And it ties back to extensibility, how easily can features be added without accidentally introducing regressions that slip into prod.\n\nUnit, integration, and regression testing are *all* concepts built to catch *human mistakes*. It's so when I make a change, I can click a button and see if my change broke anything, and we can enforce passing tests before PR's get merged to prevent mistakes. Remove the human element, and none of those concepts serve a purpose anymore.\n\n\"better than human\" programming, is programming without bugs, or need for simplicity/readability, or need for extensibility, or need for maintainability.\n\nOne example of what that might look like would be a codebase with 0 testing, and that's extremely abstract and difficult to read, to the point it might even be non-sensical to a human reader. I'd know it was either written by a \"better than human\" AI that has no need for the fundamentals of human programming, or by a bad SWE that isn't aware of the fundamentals of human programming.\n\nBetter than human programming is when AI has reached a point where 99% of the issues/concepts that this industry have literally evolved around simply no longer exist. \"Difficult to extend\" is strictly a human problem. If AI coded itself into a corner, it'd just rewrite everything from scratch. It doesn't *need* an elegant solution that doesn't need to be re-written with every little change.\n\nYour chess analogy isn't really that great here. All the elements of chess are inherent to the existence of chess. An AI is just learning to play the game. But a significant amount of the elements that make up *human* programming are not inherent to *programming*.",

        "body": "Tech skills transfer to many fields that value analytical thinking and problem-solving. Technical writing, product management, business analysis, project management, and sales engineering all leverage your tech background while moving away from pure development work.\n\nData analysis roles in non-tech industries like healthcare, finance, or logistics often need people who understand both technology and domain-specific problems. Your programming background makes you valuable for automating processes or building internal tools.\n\nTeaching or training - bootcamps, corporate training programs, or educational content creation - let you use your technical knowledge to help others learn. Many former developers transition into developer relations, technical recruiting, or consulting roles.\n\nThe current tech job market difficulties don't necessarily mean the entire industry is collapsing. Many experienced developers are finding opportunities, just with longer search times and more competition than previous years.\n\nBefore pivoting completely, consider whether you're dealing with temporary market conditions or genuine disinterest in technical work. The job search frustration might be influencing your desire to leave the field entirely.\n\nNon-tech pivots often require starting over salary-wise and building new professional networks. The grass isn't necessarily greener in other industries, many of which have their own challenges with job security and advancement.\n\nIf you do pivot, choose something that genuinely interests you rather than just escaping current difficulties. Career changes work better when driven by positive attraction to new opportunities rather than just running away from current problems.",

You'll have a very hard time getting noticed unless you really stand out in some way.\n\nThe other problem is that a lot of basic data science/engineering type tasks are something a good developer can knock out in their sleep, and it also doesn't take much before the task needs some custom software written and you basically need to be a developer anyway. We deal with massive amounts of data in all kinds of weird formats with weird encodings and inconsistencies, so we need people that can engineer solid solutions and not get stumped when their program blows up because the file has a BOM.",

Every single person who had worked on the system had quit before I got there and there was basically no documentation. Here‚Äôs what I did:\n\n1. Spent about 1 month reading, understanding, and *documenting* as much as I could. What‚Äôs the path of a regular request? What is each backend responsible for? I also drew a massive map in LucidCharts (whatever, pick your favorite drawing site) with arrows and boxes for the different backends and whatnot. I wrote 12 pages of documentation that is likely still being referenced today. \n\n2. Make sure to make absolutely clear how cooked you are. Right now, you are learning how to navigate and understand a large, unknown codebase. Inform your manager that whatever change they‚Äôre requesting will take over a month (or however much time) because you need to orient yourself and nobody can help you. It also helps to bring up that you are only here for a few months and want to help make sure that other engineers are able to make fixes after you‚Äôre gone. \n\n3. Try to figure out how to make changes, test, and receive feedback on those changes without bricking the system. For example, make custom endpoints/functions/whatever in the relevant backend that only you know of and use those to test logic before pasting it into the actual production code. It may even be good to inform your manager and seniors what error handling/logging currently looks like, and see if you can improve it. If making whatever fix is made impossibly difficult before this, let your manager/seniors know you need to be able to properly debug or you can‚Äôt make the fix. \n\n\nThis may seem sucky, but it was honestly an excellent learning experience for me. Although frankly, your situation seems worse than mine haha. \n\nYou have to be bluntly honest about how screwed you are for whatever deadline they‚Äôre trying to push for that fix. You‚Äôre an intern lol. Making fixes in an unknown, undocumented nightmare with shit logging and shit error handling would take anybody a lot of time. What‚Äôs the worst that happens, they get rid of you? You were planning on quitting anyway.",

What make me confused in my lead told me that there is no use for making charts or diagrams because it will be outdated anyway.\n\n\\- But I do think there is a sliver lining after this is I do learn a lot of stuff that SHOULD NOT BE DONE from this abomination of a codebase.

Keep your skills sharp through consistent practice and stay updated on relevant technologies in your field, but don't chase every new trend. Having a solid emergency fund reduces desperation and gives you negotiating power during job searches.\n\nFor quick job placement after layoffs, preparation matters more than speed. Maintain an updated resume, active LinkedIn presence, and professional network even while employed. Document your achievements with specific metrics and keep a portfolio of recent work ready. Many developers wait until they're unemployed to start networking, which puts them at a disadvantage.\n\nThe harsh reality is that \"quickly\" landing new jobs isn't realistic in the current market for most people. Even experienced developers are facing longer search periods than in previous years. Setting expectations of 3-6 months for job searches prevents the anxiety that comes from unrealistic timelines.\n\nFocus on financial preparation over trying to become \"layoff-proof\" since job security has decreased across the industry. Having 6-12 months of expenses saved provides genuine confidence because you can be selective about opportunities rather than accepting the first offer out of desperation.\n\nConsider contract or consulting work as bridge income rather than holding out exclusively for permanent positions. This keeps money coming in and often leads to full-time opportunities while maintaining your professional network.\n\nThe confidence issue often stems from comparing your situation to the boom years of tech hiring. The market has normalized into something more similar to other professional fields, which means standard job search strategies and realistic timelines matter more than they used to.",

Your skip isn't going to say something to them, and everybody rides off into the sunset happily ever after.\n\nSo let's look at that as a constant. Your manager sucks, and they have it out for you. That's not going to change.\n\nGiven that constant, we get a 2nd constant. You can't work with her. That's not going to change either.\n\nGiven those 2 constants, come up with your paths forward. There's not many, and they all rely on your skip.\n\nOne path that solves everything is your skip decides your manager is not performing well, and they fire them. You have no idea if they'll do this, and they're certainly not gonna talk about it with you, and even if they are going to do it this could easily take 6+ months. Maybe more.\n\nIf they don't do that, or you don't want to wait for something that may never happen, the next option is to tell your skip to transfer teams. *Tell*. You don't even need to explain yourself, they know whats up.\n\nIf they don't let you transfer teams, then your final option is to start looking for jobs elsewhere.\n\nThis won't be the last bad manager you encounter in your career. You won't be able to change this person. There's a reason it's a LinkedIN cliche to say \"employees don't leave companies, they leave managers\".",

They also usually do mock interviews, resume review etc., and it's good to have a solid handle on interviewing by the time you actually start doing it for internships.\n\nMy biggest suggestion would be to make a lot of friends in the your major. It's crazy how much of an edge knowing people gets you in the interview process. Make friends, friends graduate / have internships, gives you a leg in. This is so overlooked in CS in my opinion. Idk if it's just not generally understood, or if people willfully ignore it because they are super introverted and/or socially anxious, but seriously - make lots of friends. And have fun along the way, because life is short and uni is a really unique time of newly realized autonomy and freedom in our budding adult lives",

I dont regret it. Also, one of those early managers who kept me on with a 20% raise is still a friend who I have worked with at 2 other companies since. I dont think any good manager will take it personally. And if they do, you dont want to work there anyway.",

Explain in your counter your current value (and recent big wins you‚Äôve given the company).\n\nAsking for 15-20% seems reasonable. Although, even if you get away with that, say a 15% raise, that probably means next pay adjustment period instead of getting a ~3% adjustment they‚Äôll just skip the raise and say ‚Äúwell you just got promoted and we gave you the extra little bit in negotiations‚Äù. In other words, it may just all wash out to not much in the end.\n\nAgain, I‚Äôm shellshocked. You describe a company with policies in place to let them be obstinate and slow in pay raises. Since they control and purse strings and the policies, they can always point at the policies they made and say their hands are tied. That‚Äôs my experience.",

That can include meetings, mandatory training, reading status update emails from others on your team, reading companywide emails, installing security updates, and so on.\n\nThat leaves you with 32 hours of productive work (e.g. coding).\n\nIf you switch to half-time, that overhead doesn't noticeably decrease. So now you end up with only 12 hours of productive work, which is a lot less than half.\n\nIn my experience, the most junior employees are the ones who have the least overhead - so they'd probably be the least affected - but then again, they're also the least productive so I wouldn't want them to be even less productive.\n\nThe most senior employees tend to have the most overhead - they're in more meetings, they email with many more groups within the company.\n\nHonestly, there are many weeks where if I only worked 20 hours, I wouldn't have time to finish a single productive task.",
