Even for experienced folks, there are lots more laid-off people looking for jobs in this market so it's just more competitive. Entry-level is fucked beyond belief.\n\n>Why are companies acting like jerks?\n\nThey can afford to be more picky. Sometimes, it does seem quite ridiculous though and I do feel that many employers actually have unreasonable expectations and are so hostile/skeptical of others' work experience that they want perfection.",

I recently joined a new company and I'm absolutely blown away by the use of delivery teams, lack of anyone doing real work outside the data engineer and dashboard critiques from end users. Then they wonder why they can't find someone or when they do ends up telling them \"I haven't done that before\" and throws off the quarters goals, which is unacceptable. No idea how to deal with it but I really think they're just using the shit job market to expand our responsibilities to save money in the short term. In 5 years when the data no longer makes sense and they need to find another excuse for a redesign we will see the find out part of fuck around and find out.",

You are competing with applicants who have connections plus are experienced plus have direct knowledge of the domain.\n\nAnother company I know put up a fake job posting for DE (the position was already hired, but needed to repost due to a migration to a new hiring systems).  They purposely only posted the position on their public website and did not post on any job boards. Received 300 applicants in less than 1 day.\n\nSad thing was, their automated rejection email says: “we have reviewed your background and qualifications and determined that we do not have a position for you” pretty fucked up considering that not a single applicant was reviewed since it was a fake posting.\n\nThis position did go to someone who needs training though, that person had alot of experience in DA, but none in DE, and since high DA salaries are in-line with entry level DE, they know the applicant is capable and will stay. The company received many stellar applicants, but didn’t have the budget to pay for their asking salaries.

But you can be displaced by the perception that one is “good enough.”\n\nI think the arguments on both sides of the LLM table are misplaced.\n\nEvery conversation online about AI replacing humans is centered around looking at it from an individualistic perspective. But that’s not how labor works in the workplace.\n\nEssentially, both of the below statements can be true:\n\n- AI can’t be a drop-in replacement for Data Engineering\n- I, as a Data Engineer, can be replaced with AI.\n\n\n\nIf a company begins using LLMs to perform tasks that are repetitive/boilerplate/specific to the strengths of the LLM, and that work makes up a X% of the labor of their data engineering department, allowing for more time from each individual data engineer to perform more work suited for the human DE, then justification for keeping ALL of the original labor isn’t there - assuming the same amount of work is being done.\n\nWhen looking at this from the macroeconomic scale, yes the usage of LLMs to increase productivity in the workplace - whether by agentic automation or simply by using it as a quicker and more efficient task-oriented search engine, WILL have an effect on the number of jobs available in DE and very well could lead to YOU being replaced by an AI, while not replacing all DEs.\n\nAt any rate, I generally agree with your points on side-stepping being labeled for replacement by embracing and becoming the expert in the business with LLMs usage. It’s what I’ve done and led to me being promoted and now sitting in a much higher position within the company I work for.",

You are getting confused by marketing terms and, unfortunately, that is by design. \n\nI think you can spot me what a database is. That's pretty straight forward. A data warehouse is just a very, very large database. There are two different database areas, operational and analytic. They are characterised by the SLAs you have on the data. Smaller databases are normally used for operational because you need fast response times. In analytic, the response times aren't normally as critical but they handle quite a bit more data; much of it historic. In a perfect world, if you could do both with the same system, you would. The problem is the cost to do them all in one. Of course, these are gross oversimplifications but it gets the idea across. In addition to the database component, the surrounding data ecosystems are different but they have many commonalities.\n\nData Lake and Lakehouse are both marketing BS. Nothing more. The same is true of \"medalion architecture.\" It is an attemp to make the standard three tier (staging, core, semantic) into to something different by giving it a new coat of paint. Someone noticed that you can store quite a bit of extra \"stuff\" in the staging layer beyond what the database needs. Of course, the marketing folks thought that needed a new name. I think we are at the point now where we just keep adding buzzwords to the names. It's like a technical pin the tail on the donkey. The latest is \"now with more AI!.\" \n\nA data ecosystem is a complicated enough of an endeavor without all the confusion that is being pushed on it purposefully. I haven't even started in on Inmon, Kimball, Stars, Snowflakes, the various normal forms, ETL/ELT, etc. Good luck on your journey.",

A lot of decisions rely on knowledge and experience and attempting to quantify that at all ends up falling into the same trap that dashboards do: Qualitative judgements are only loosely connected to quantitative amounts.\n\nI don't doubt Jeff Bezos knows what he's doing up to a point but I have my doubts his actual working practice bears much resemblance to the principle he's expressing here. Plus I expect there's a healthy amount of survivorship bias going on when analysing whatever Bezos is doing - 100th idiot syndrome if you will. Just because it worked for him doesn't mean it will work for anyone else.",

Numbers need to be put in context and fit into some kind of overarching narrative before it clicks. The great writers of Substack already understand this. Think Scott Alexander, Noah Smith, Nate Silver. Or go read Wolf Street. MUCH more intuitive than any business dashboard I've ever looked at.\n\nBut the flip side of that is: when are dashboards appropriate? Should all analysis just be ad-hoc and narrative-driven? My intuition is that you should curate a very small, simple set of business-wide KPIs and put them on an internal website and have them update reliably a few times a day. For anything more strategic or involved, where there is a key decision to be made, you need analysts to put on the researcher hat and go do the analysis (hopefully with a nice clean data model that the DEs have set up). You need them to be opinionated. Dashboards aren't opinionated, they just tell you what happened without any further guidance.",

For example, try building a pipeline that pulls data from a public API, stores it in a cloud bucket or local database, and runs some transformation on a schedule. \n\nWe have a lot of interactive courses, so feel free to check out our site and browse! \n\nAnd finally, don’t get overwhelmed by the tool soup. AWS, GCP, Azure, Snowflake, Spark, Kafka, dbt... You don’t need to learn everything at once. Start with one cloud provider, one orchestration tool, one data warehouse. The concepts transfer well once you understand them.",

Mostly, I was transforming and consolidating data using on prem tools to automate our processes. \n\nAfter that, I took a BI manager role with our data science team (data science was initially part of BI at my company). Spent a year there until a big reorganization occurred. We moved to the cloud, data science became its own thing, a data engineering team got stood up. I initially moved with data science, but it was clear my skills did not mesh well except for the data engineering, but they wanted to move all DE work over to the DE team eventually. I took that opportunity after just over a year in that position. \n\nOn day 1 with the DE team, we were building stop gap solutions. I spent that time getting really good with pyspark. I already had a large background with pandas, so pyspark was very easy to figure out. From there, we had consultants build our long term data platform while the full timers worked on ad hoc requests to keep the business moving and start making a name for our team. During this time, I learned I was really good at programming business logic and transformations. I was not nearly as good at ingestion or tools outside of databricks. \n\nEventually our SAAS integration started, and I was working directly with consultants. I was well out of my depth, but I learned the process pretty quickly, patched some early holes in my technical knowledge, and got rolling. \n\nI learned that I was really good at functional programming, but pretty bad at DevOps and way out of my league in OOP. \n\nNow, I'm working on a project to rebuild our data platform to one easier to maintain, more flexible, and moves data faster. I'm focusing more on architecture, but making sure that these new consultants are training my team and me every step of the way. My manager assigned me as lead for this project. \n\nMy manager wants me to train to become an engineering architect. Whereas I'm a decent engineer with a lot of potential to grow there, I am kinda a natural on all things architectural. So that is how I'm leaning now.",

        "body": "Hi Guys, Snowflake employee here & just wanted chime in with a bit more info on this topic so you guys are clear what the new feature is and what it is not.\n\nPreviously, we had 2 main methods for Spark users to interact with or leverage Snowflake vectorized engine.\n\n1. Snowpark Dataframes: These were close to PySpark APIs but (not exact).  Initially (2,3 years ago) they were limited in coverage but as of now, do cover most of PySpark functions so if you tried it before, experience is much different now. Because Snowpark was not exactly as PySpark, it did require about 10% code refactoring so some migration effort was necessary. Benefit of Snowpark dataframes was that they were not held back by OSS PySpark Functions so you had access to Snowflake specific ML & AI functions and the newest features. Snowpark Dataframes allowed you to leverage 100% Snowflake Serverless Compute engines for SQL, Python, Java & Scala UDFs.\n2. Snowflake Spark Connector: This was meant to connect existing Spark clusters to Snowflake to read, transform & write data to/from Snowflake. Driver has some optimization where some of the aggr functions could be performed in Snowflake before delivering the data to Spark cluster but the Spark Compute Clusters did bulk of the work where Snowflake was input and/or output for the data.\n\nThe new Apache Spark Connect from Snowpark combines best of both worlds Apache Spark code that developers love & use for Data Engineering & ML and Snowpark which gives access to serverless vectorized engine for SQL, Python, java & Scala jobs.\n\nRecent innovation from Spark Connect from OSS Spark community was the catalyst that Snowflake was waiting for to integrate OSS Spark in to Snowflake ecosystem the right way.\n\nThis means you can now run your existing Spark jobs with 0 code changes on Snowflake compute which comes with many added benefits such as unified security & governance, performance, auditability & simplicity as compute is serverless and requires little to no optimization or maintenance.\n\nHow it works is that the OSS Spark sends the job details to Snowflake, Snowflake generates a new execution plan based on the original details that can run on Snowflake Vectorized Engine (SQL, Python UDFs & etc.) sot he original code remains the same but where & how it executes in back are different.\n\nOur initial focus for Public Preview was majority of the customer use cases that we have seen which are Data Engineering & ML workloads that use SQL, Dataframes & UDFs. We are actively working on collecting feedback and build  support for other new Spark features supported by the OSS Spark Connect project so definitely would love any feedback that you guys have to take to our PMs.\n\nI understand this may not be the right fit for every Spark team. If your team enjoys tweaking Spark params & cluster configs to get every ounce of performance out of clusters then this solution may not be a good fit. However, if the team enjoys Spark code and has a ton of existing pipelines but would rather spend their time building & deploying new projects vs. optimizing & maintaining cluster, it will be a great benefit. Especially if Snowflake is the downstream analytics layer as it would eliminate any Export & Import jobs(time & cost) between Spark & Snowflake environments. \n\nThe main goal is to meet developers where they are by offering ways for them to leverage advances Snowflake capabilities by offering them different means to work with Snowflake in their preferred language and coding frameworks.\n\nIf you guys give it a try and have inputs don't hesitate the reach out and let us know feedback.The good, bad & the ugly.",

You can “ask” them things like, “why did this job fail?” and they’ll trace logs and give a quick readout.\n\nBut yeah—data access and vendor lock-in are real concerns. What helps:\n\n* Keep critical logic in your pipeline code, not in the agent\n* Let the agent suggest, but not act unless a human approves\n* Keep agent inputs small (e.g., just metadata or logs, not full datasets)\n\nCurious what tooling you’re testing?",

More like $5k/year tops. Here was my approach:\n\n* Sources: AWS Aurora Postgres database, various APIs, potentially Netsuite down the road\n* Destination: Timescale (now TigerData) database hosted using Timescale Cloud but linked to our VPC via VPC peering -- **this is where the bulk of our budget is going**.\n* Tech stack:\n   * Pulumi TypeScript to build infrastructure in AWS to support the open source version of the orchestrator, mostly using ECS Fargate for the containers and leveraging existing networking infrastructure\n   * Dagster OSS as the orchestration (went back and forth between this and Prefect before landing on Dagster)\n   * Sling as the core extract and load software to sync data from Postgres to Timescale\n   * dbt core running within the Dagster framework to apply transformations on new data in Timescale\n   * Python scripts orchestrated by Dagster to get data from APIs. Originally wanted to try dltHub but ended up just writing my own scripts using requests (probably not ideal)\n   * Monitoring/notifications via Slack app integration (originally was using [ntfy.sh](http://ntfy.sh) for quick and dirty SNS topic-like notifications, getting Slack approval was challenging)\n   * Dockerized local development using the pre-built Timescale and Postgres Docker images + the same custom Dockerfile I use for Dagster production deployments to keep things as simple as possible.\n\nData is synced from Postgres every 4 hours and daily for the APIs as that's essentially all that's required by our business. The Postgres sync with Sling runs incrementally and is complete in about 20 minutes, which is not optimized by any means but is sufficient for our purposes. For context, our entire source database was only about 330GB and I wasn't replicating the entire thing.\n\nWriting YAML for Sling and later for dbt was a huge time slog for 100+ source tables; I leveraged an AI tool (Claude) to help generate a lot of that code after manually building some of the transformation models myself. Bonus to this is it was the generated YAML was pretty consistent for common columns like `created_at` or `_sling_loaded_at` audit columns.\n\nI am the lone developer and maintainer of this project -- most people on my team are unaware that I'm even working on a project like this, let alone what its purpose might be. It has been a wild and frustrating ride at times without many others to turn to for help, but it's been a great learning experience as well. Throughout the development, I tried to stress simplicity, modularity, and ease of maintenance as much as possible. Once a larger team becomes available to support something like this, you can make different decisions like moving your data replication tasks to something like Fivetran or using a real data warehouse like Snowflake (again, budget constraints for us).\n\n~~Best of luck to you!~~ Edit: I reread the question and realized this is hypothetical but best of luck if this is ever you in the future all the same! Also I feel like my stack is pretty interchangeable with SQL Server as the source, just use different connectors with Sling (I believe SQL Server is supported).",

Then made a vector equivalent value of the theme and the chunks,applied a roll-over technique aswell to merge adjacent chunks which cosine similarity beats a tested threshold. Then persisted this data to my database, with every single chunk having its appropriate time-window, from where it was cut off from in the YouTube video.\n\nI then created an interface with streamlit where I could see the data-breakdown, their theme, the video thumbnail and the time the video was cut off from, (so this also works as an automatically created YouTube chapters as opposed watching the video and titling sections by hand)\n\nI also created an input field where questions relating to any part in any of the videos are asked and the top 5 chunks which are most relevant to the question are retrieved and displayed on the UI.\n\nThe videos fed into the pipeline could be a playlist or multiple channels with batch extractions.\n\nI personally use this now to get to the most relevant part of an information I'm trying to reach out to in the news.

Iot has changed, when it first started it simple scalar data like temperature and there was only a couple of things going on. These days there are much higher expectations on what the devices need to do. \n\nThey expect always on at the edge monitoring of complex sensors and it takes a fundamental change in the org to get that done. You need your ml or data team to get in the drivers seat and make the pieces fit all the way from the firmware up to the customer UI’s and tying it all together. \n\nWanting it to be simple of easy won’t help.

I don't want to spend CPU cycles testing MS SQL Server features that have been in place for decades.\n\nIf you don't mean that kind of dupe, then that starts a valuable but lengthy discussion about what we DO mean by a duplicate; the answer for us varies by table/entity, and is generally too complex for any off-the-shelf tool to handle (that I've seen).\n\nSo in short, for us the only business value is in a much more manual DQ process (manually defining what DQ means, not manually checking it!).

I agree with the comments about consulting mostly, but I doubt they would put you on client work or at least throw you to the wolves like they would with an employee.  Having worked both for telcos and consulting, I will give you some thoughts:\n\nConsulting:  you will probably work on one or a few projects.  They are looking for prospects to hire when you graduate so it's like an extended evaluation.  Consulting is good because you get exposure to different industries and projects, so you learn skills and approaches you might not pick up working elsewhere.  One other thing that's maybe overlooked is that you learn how to sell and explain your work, which is valuable in companies later when you need to justify a project or hype it up beyond just explaining the technical side.  Working there as an employee though can be grueling not just because of the hours, but because you need to build your career often with little help.  They assign you to some client and expect you to pick up the skills you need.  They usually do give you some support with a mentor role, but they might be good or just suck since they are assigned.  So it can be a stressful experience depending on your personality and resiliency.\n\nTelcos:  this is a good option because you will get exposure to a lot of processes with a lot of data flowing.  It's mostly structured though, but really teaches you how to deal with high volumes.  If we are talking a bigger telco like AT&T or whatever then they tend to have all the tools and applications so you aren't looking at a kludged together mess like in some other companies.  There is data stored around all the different processes that go on in a telco, so while the product isn't the data platform, it's probably as close as you are going to get.  There is usually some pretty high-level analytics work going on as well around customer retention and upsell.",

First came BI developers/ETL engineers, they built warehouses and reports so analysts could do their work. Later, data analysts became more self-serve and focused on interpreting the past. Then data science took off, using that historical data to predict the future.\n\nBoth analysts and scientists quickly ran into the same problem: clean, reliable, well-structured data was hard to come by. That’s when the modern data engineer role emerged, not just to build infra, but to make data usable at scale.\n\nEarly DE work was infra-heavy, but as platforms matured (Databricks, GCP, Azure, Snowflake), more of the plumbing became automated. That doesn’t mean the job is going away, it means the focus shifts. You spend less time reinventing connectors and clusters, more time on things like modeling, scalability, governance, security, cost optimization, and integrating multiple data sources into a coherent system.\n\nThis is also where analytics engineers come in, they work closer to the business, doing a lot of SQL/dbt modeling and BI integration. In small teams, AEs might cover most data needs; in bigger orgs, DEs still handle the scale, complexity, streaming, and compliance side.\n\nIf anything, the “easy” DE tasks are disappearing, which makes deep skills more valuable:\n\n* Real-time pipelines (Kafka, Pub/Sub, Flink)\n* Data contracts, governance, compliance\n* Multi-cloud / cross-platform integration\n* ML data pipelines & feature stores\n* Performance and cost tuning at scale\n\nI wouldn’t say DE is shrinking, it’s just changing shape. The safest way to future-proof yourself is to stay close to both the business context *and* the technical challenges. Platforms will keep automating, but stitching them together, governing them, and making them serve the business well? That’s still human work.",

Dagster does the orchestration for me, as implied, then dbt does transformations after data has landed in Timescale, also orchestrated by Dagster.\n\nI can't really speak to how the performance would be with loading data into Snowflake via Sling, but it backfilled about 300GB of data on the initial run in under 6 hours and every 4 hour incremental loads take around 20 minutes (though this could probably be optimized much further). All hosted on ECS Fargate containers.\n\nIf we had no budget constraints, I'd probably look at a SaaS offering to do the extract and load for me, like Fivetran or equivalent.",

Taking a dependency on this could potentially be very expensive in the future. If you have small data utilization (and plan to remain at that level), then don't see an issue from a pricing perspective.\n\nAnother thing to consider here is making sure you temper expectations of the wider business. With no data engineers and a single analyst, there is limited investment in the data function (based on the provided information). Given the connector choice, maybe you report to finance? Regardless, it's one thing to get the data from point A to point B, it's another to ensure the data is correct. For example, what happens if they change the configuration of Salesforce objects? How will you handle that downstream?\n\nI say the above to warn of the trap of the business thinking that increased access to data easily results in more data utilization.",

They've essentially looked at a sledgehammer and decided that it is 'not a serious tool' because it requires more effort, is more unwieldy, and lacks a claw compared to a regular hammer.\n\nThe article indicates it is a 21 minute read, so I'm going to be somewhat brief here, but essentially other than various truisms the entire thing can be broken down. The article is also quite sarcastic and derogatory, which gives me the impression that the author is more interested in puffing themselves up than earnestly engaging with the problem space.\n\nI'll pick a few things that are emblematic of the disconnect between the author's basis for criticism and what iceberg is actually for.\n\n---\n\n> It also means that the overhead of each file is large (in the order of 1KB).\n\nIceberg (and DeltaLake/Hudi, I'll not mention again) is intended for storing many gigabytes to terabytes and petabytes of data in a given 'table' -- a few KB of overhead is going to be less than 0.001% of the data you're actually reading or writing. You'll likely have more overhead within the parquet files themselves if they've been split relatively small, and your choice of compression algorithm is going to have orders of magnitude more impact.\n\n> Putting the burden on the client\n\nThe entire point of the base layer of 'lakehouse' implementations is to decouple storage from the compute. That is: *there is no server* to even consider to be 'putting the burden on the client'. You may as well complain that trains have to run on rails.\n\n> If clients need to write manifest lists that point at all Manifest Files - we have already leaked the location of every single S3 file worth stealing\n\nThe path to an S3 file is not sensitive data, it is protected through access control to the bucket. You may as well complain that clients connecting to databases leaks the IP of the database.\n\nIceberg is not intended to solve row-level security for you in the same way that parquet does not solve row level security. It simply isn't in the scope of what it is trying to solve, because it isn't seeking to replace a database.\n\n> Did we not learn in CS 101 that if you need O(n) operations to append to a list, you are probably doing something wrong?\n\nThis section completely ignores something that the author *should* know quite well, that sometimes you exchange processing time for space consumption. For metadata files the repeated data is utterly insignificant compared to all the other reads and writes that are happening, but because we're dealing with remote storage accessed over a network then when reading it is much more efficient to retrieve a single larger block of data than make many individual requests.\n\nIn fact the author later whinges that a query has to do sequential 2 metadata reads to locate the parquet files it needs - so they *do* understand the benefit of compacting data together, but they just choose to ignore that in this instance so that they can heap more derision on Iceberg.\n\n> Optimistic Concurrency - Why it does not work!  ... is there ever a point to optimistic concurrency control? ... In Iceberg, two concurrent writes to a table will ALWAYS be in conflict \n\nA section in which the author almost realises they may be lacking some perspective, but plows on ahead anyway.\n\nFirst of all, Iceberg is considered about the overall efficiency for readers and writers that are operating in completely isolated processing environments, and when writing data they are going to be writing a *lot* of data and it may take a relatively long time (seconds to minutes). A complete pessimistic lock would prevent concurrent non-conflicting writes, which means you could only ever effectively have one writer to a table, which would be an unnecessary restricting if you have pure-append ingestion processes, and pure-append ingestion processes are very common in lake/lakehouse implementations.\n\nAnd yes, you can have non-conflicting *data* writes even if the metadata writes are conflicting, but as I've mentioned in here the metadata is insignificant compared to the data in intended use cases. Getting a writer to rewrite even a 1MB metadata file is a significantly better tradeoff than having them sit idle for many seconds to minutes, when their compute runtime is costing you money. And that's if they even get a conflict - subsecond timings on completion of concurrent writes is pretty rare for the intended use cases.\n\n>  \"Tables grow large by being written to, they grow really large by being written to frequently\".\n\nComplete bullshit. My largest tables are either full snapshots taken periodically from sources, or they use streaming ingestion with buffered writes. In fact streaming ingestion is directly a use-case for optimistic concurrency - each partition can have a separate writer and they can all write data concurrently and commit periodically.\n\n> Did I mention that 1000 commits/sec is a pathetic number if you are appending rows to table?\n\nAbsolutely unhinged criticism. The target format is parquet and the default row group size for writers is on the order of 100k to 1M rows. To hit a required 1k commits/sec you'd be looking at ingesting >100M rows/sec and 100GB/sec of *compressed* data while having each individual parquet file be committed one-by-one with a thousand independent writing processes.\n\nWhat you would *actually* do is have a partitioned writer that has 1000 concurrent parquet writes, and it commits once per second. The author is just *inventing* problems.\n\n> Intermezzo: Iceberg REALLY does not want to be a database\n\nThen why are you critiquing it like it is one?\n\nThis is ridiculous. I'm out, and I'm barely half way through the article.",

Either get a more senior position within DE (like what your boss does) or switch to a front end role (or better yet a well-rounded BI dev role who does both DE and front end). Might need to work for a smaller team in that case, though. \n\nThe best would be a liaison role between IT and the business, but usually that's a people manager. Just show interest in the business and push to learn more. If your boss isn't gatekeeping you, you may be able to get on some calls with the business.",

It's never handed to you as documentation, except in very rare, very specific industries where you need to be trained / certified to do the job in the first place.  \n\nAs a result, it's acquired more slowly.  Couple that with the trend of leaving jobs every 18-24 months, and you never really acquire any domain knowledge, you just bounce around doing the same technical thing.\n\nThe solution?  First, identify someone who knows what you want to know.  There is always \"that guy\".  Talk to him (or her) and just ask questions.  You will start to find out what things matter and what things you don't know.  Don't treat it like an interrogation, just ask questions to help answer 'why' questions you have about your work.  \"How come we match customer data through three other systems, wouldn't it be easier if we...?\"  ...well, we do that because regulations require XYZ, and then we have to ...\n\nThis is where you begin to acquire the kind of knowledge you're looking for.  If you are persistent in filling gaps in your own knowledge, you'll get there.  But do not be surprised if it takes longer than you think.  You will not acquire expert-level domain knowledge and simultaneously acquire expert-level data engineering knowledge in 5 years' time.",

But it allow your to grow, avoid potential vendor locking, reduce DW cost by doing preaggregation yourself before loading it in redshift, etc, etc. But all of this requires a lot of effort? Which might be slowing you down to achieving you company goals. If you have a big enough data team it make sense, if you are pretty small the loading directly to redshift is very appealing.\n\nYou’ll always have the possibility to offload the data from redshift to s3 in the futur if that’s needed but you won’t shoot yourself in the foot and not deliver anything for the first 6 months.\n\nIn terms of pricing, you are analyzing storage cost which shouldn’t be a factor imo. Yes storage is way cheaper in s3. But the size of data you have in SAP isn’t probably not that big. You need to define that first. For example I don’t see a world where you have a terabyte of data to load from SAP to redshift. A terabyte of text files is a LOT of data for things that are entered manually or mostly in SAP. \n\nNow let’s say you have a terabyte of data because your company has a lot there (which you probably don’t) then having the storage cost in redshift would be something are 25$ per month for the hole data set. Our conversation here cost more than that. Depending on type of s3 storage you might save a lot but storage is negligible for small datasets.\n\nThe real DW cost is compute, and that needs to be considered. \n\nI know the business wants SAP and ALL other sources, but you should chunk this a lot so you endup delivering things in small chunks. Everyone wants everything yesterday but that’s not how things work. Start with SAP but not all, the most relevant concepts because there’s probably a lot of tables there to sync, clean, transform to make the data usable. The goal of you DW is to make data usable but also to get a single source of truth. If you just load raw data in and let business build dashboard on top of the raw data I can tell you this is going to be a mess in 2 months. \n\nStart small, get the table requirements that allow you to clean the data, make the data available, then repeat.\n\nTo go back on pricing, if for example you think that you have A LOT of data multiple terabytes. And that the storage cost will be around 1000$ a month because you have 40 terabytes to load and that can be an issue, then I can assure you, you won’t like the Fivetran Bill. If you need to think about the storage cost, then you need to rearchitect this because Fivetran is not the option you are looking for. It’s very good to load data quickly. It gets insanely expensive when you start to really use it. Most companies won’t have issue with fivetran cost because most company don’t have a lot of data.\n\nGood luck",

See correct config to save processing and make it write faster, as no retention period. You may also apply clustering rules here.\n\nThen I would ask, do you really need redshift?

But considering the future, if data size increases, it will be a problem. Although data honestly wouldn’t spike much. \n\nComing to your point where if redshift is even needed: yes I feel so because we currently have tableau connected directly to sap where the devs created views which consume a lot of compute making dashboards slow. If we use s3 tables, we will have to use Athena for querying and connect that to tableau, and we have a lot of complex queries/views built on top. I don’t think it’s a good solution to use Athena as our query engine.\n\nAnd I am the only DE here so it will be difficult for me to write code for every table and it’s upsert logic if it lands in s3 first.

Qualifiers are appended to the left, so they read from precise to general (or in the order of processing).\n  2. Adjectives ordering should follow the English grammar rule. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective#Order\n\n- Good: `monthly_amazon_payments`:\n  - a row represents monthly aggregated properties of Amazon payments: revenue sum, unique customers count etc.\n  - processing order: source `payments` table > Amazon only filtering > monthly aggregation\n- Bad: `monthly_payments_amazon` (a row does not represent an Amazon)\n\nIf you need to group tables together so it is more readable for a specific use case, or you need to restrict access, put them in the same schema/database. For example, all the gold tables for the financial analysts go in the schema `finance`.\n\nThis is not a dogma, maybe your context needs to have a specific strongly discriminating qualifier first which could go against the rule 3. It depends on the use case, give us some anonymized examples.",

But note that it’s kinda nice to have a language that anyone can easily understand and transform data with rather than a specific one. Even more if you are a very small team of 1.\n\nAlso this is nice , but doesn’t seem manageable by only you. It’s a lot. Also I think you need some really good argument to change something that is currently working (redshift) with something that slower and would do the same thing.

When people need to have a dashboard or something we deal with writing the model for it. As a data engineer I consider it's part of my job.\nMy concerns about DBT is that it's a simple product but not sealable in the future. Especially doing unit tests is very limited as some column types are not supported making testing some models impossible. With Spark jobs I can fully test queries making sure to handle edge cases properly and it's easier to scale jobs when data volume will grow, with DBT running on GitHub actions runners we are limited in performance and from my point of view it's not a clean way to schedule jobs: no clear monitoring, retry policies etc. like with Airflow for example",

Aside from that, I agree with most of what’s been said. If I do join the bank, it would mainly be to see if I like it, and if not, maybe after a year I’ll move on and focus 100% on Data Engineering.\n\nThe only thing that gives me second thoughts is that the offer from the consultancy seems very tailored to recent graduates and designed to train them specifically for Data Engineering, which I think is really valuable. I’m just unsure whether, a year from now, I’d still be able to get an opportunity like that if I pass it up now.",

They’re powerful tools, but for most of my early projects, SQL could have solved 90% of my problems faster and more cleanly. SQL is easier to debug, easier to optimize, and much more universal across platforms. If I could go back, I’d master SQL-based transformation first before diving deep into dataframe libraries.\n\nThat’s why, instead of jumping straight into Docker/Airflow, I’d start with a SQL-centric transformation tool like dbt (or Bruin, which also lets you run Python and handle ingestion). This will teach you the fundamentals of data modeling and pipeline design without the operational complexity of containers and schedulers. Since you already use Tableau, learning the “one step before the dashboard” will make the whole puzzle click.\n\nAnother big lesson: don’t get lost in technical rabbit holes. The fastest way to grow is to chase the highest-impact business problems, things that save your team time, increase accuracy, or unlock new capabilities. If you focus there, you’ll naturally pick up the right technical skills along the way.\n\nAlso, don’t work in isolation. Get your code reviewed, and review others’ work. You’ll learn more from those reviews than from most courses.\n\nIf I were mapping a path for you, it’d be:\n\n1. Master SQL + data modeling (dbt/Bruin/SQLMesh)\n2. Add Python tasks in the pipeline only when needed\n3. Develop a tool in Streamlit and deploy it for the use of business team\n4. Develop an ML model, and deploy it.\n\nYou’ll hit Docker and Airflow eventually, but starting with modeling skills will make everything else much easier.",

My understanding is that Pulsar is a push-based publish-subscribe model (like if you subscribed to someone’s Substack email newsletter). You therefore need a translation interface to perform the pull from the API and then publish it in the appropriate stream or message queue format to Pulsar. You may need something similar between Pulsar and Ceph as well; I’m not familiar enough with Pulsar to say. \n\nUnless your API fetcher has the ability to also write to object storage, your first point of storage appears to be the post-Pulsar Ceph so would be there. Ideally you want to create that archive copy as close to the source as possible, so it’s determining where the storage opportunities are in your flow.

I have no experience with Azure Synapse Serverless so I can't say either way.\n\nAnother option would be looking at RedGate tooling, which is my go-to for commercially licensed support for any of Microsoft's database technology. Nothing really compares to it and their tooling is extremely mature and has more features than you could ever use.",

It has always been a manual effort to get good quality business information about the data. It is almost a data project unto itself.\n\nThis however is just the start. You will probably want to document lineage, transformation, quality, etc. Those are all needed and highly helpful but take time and effort to establish.

I worked as a chef for 10 years and before that in media and now I transitioned to programming.\nOne thing that was worth it from the bootcamp that helped me a lot was the access to mentors. I have been thinking that it is a shame that a lot of people pay so much money just to access to a weekly 30 min call with a mentor (sometimes even less). The material to learn is already online with even well structured tutorials or learning path, but free mentoring options are missing.\n\nI have been planning for quite some time to build a website in which programmers and other professionals can offer free mentoring options for people who are learning or starting. It doesn’t have to be for a long time or long sessions but some guidance or even code review could work. \n\nWould you be open to help me build this project? Would anybody be interested in something like this? Does a similar platform exist? It has to be completely free of charge (kind of like freecodecamp but for mentoring)",

I didnt knew like 3 methods it was using or what a debounced search actually is, so my next 3 prompts where asking the AI to explain what a debounced search is and how the code it suggested actually works. Even after this i was very unfamiliar with the methods being used, so my next step was jumping into microsoft documentation to see the definition of these methods.

You probably have no interest in how dating websites work etc. That is the likely reason you are not excited about it.\n\nPick a subject you enjoy in real life, like Football, cooking, rugby, gaming, etc. Then think of a little idea. Take football for example, you could build a simple hard coded Stadium displayer. Which shows you the top 10 largest stadiums in the world. It can then display facts about each stadium. Keep it real simple, nothing fancy. Make sure you write the project idea down too and break it up into small objectives.\n\nFor example:\n* Create array of hard coded data\n* Create stadium card to display name, image, stats like capacity, facts like famous matches played there\n\nThen once you have a basic version, have a look at it and see what to improve. Things like add a database, authentication, better styles, etc.\n\nIf you don’t relate programming to what you are actually passionate about and enjoy then you’ll probably just eventually drop it.\n\nThe people you see that are passionate about programming and love it are actually passionate about the area they’re building in rather than the idea of programming itself.",

You can do leet code, making your own app, it doesn't really matter, what matters is you are staring at code so your brain gets better at it.\n\nIf you do this you will have a bunch of free time and be ahead of everyone. If you don't do this you will be in a rush all the time and that SUCKS. Luckily I got this advice early so I only did like 1 or 2 all nighters in my entire degree.\n\nAlso make friends with your tutors and ask questions, it might take a few months but figure out who the smartest people in the year are and try and get into their study groups.\n\nAlso exercise. You will probably be able to take advantage of free classes at the gym and it does wonders for your mental health. To clarify join the classes as they will teach you how to exercise correctly, don't try and figure it out on your own.\n\nIf you want to get a partner / find a fun social group join the evening student dance classes. There's usually like salsa or something. If you have some social anxiety this will help MASSIVELY!\n\nIf you want to code in the evenings too see if there's some kind of competitive programming stuff like capture the flag teams. You get to travel on them and it's a pretty wild experience. You will also become friends with more experienced programmers who can give you great advice.\n\nJust to highlight again, 9 to 5 every week day you are studying.\n\nGood luck and have fun!",

So I can speed up my productivity too, you know.\n\nI tried using AIs to handle basic tasks for me when everyone started saying that AI would ruin programmers' lives and produce outdated, broken, and bug-ridden code. Yeah, it might be faster because some parts are already done and just need tweaking, but that works for small scripts since they are simple and easy to track and fix. However, it's impossible for an AI to create a full app exactly as you want because you can't specify all the details. There will always be things you do through pure automation simply because you're used to coding.\n\nLast time I asked an AI to write a server.js to run express, and it just didn’t work. I had to write everything again lol (by writing everything again, I mean going to my GitHub and copying and pasting my last server.js, which was also copy-pasted from my previous project).\n\nSo no, AI does not destroy programming. There are no AI writing apps on demand, you could use something like Copilot, but it won't make a big difference unless you're doing repetitive coding. And if you are doing that, you're probably coding in the wrong way.\n\nPeople also talk about AI replacing artists, but artists are still working because AI can do some things to represent your ideas. However, it will never capture everything the way you want because your ideas need a brain with empathy to understand what you truly mean and what you want to do it as you wish. An AI can only replicate what you do, and all the details you don't provide, the AI will just do whatever it wants.\n\nYou can tell an artist, \"I want my character to be like Jhon Wick,\" and they will take your ideas and adapt them to fit Jhon Wick vibes, while an AI will probably do Jhon Wick and just add some wonky details on top of it.",

Most of them focus on front end web dev, lots cover back end too. Having hired bootcamp attendees, I've concluded that it's a really mixed bag and depends entirely on the provider. Some are decent (still never as good as recent CS grads IME) and some aren't worth the paper the certificate is printed on. Most of them inflate the numbers that communicate the success of their past grads (some by giving grads jobs themselves etc.).\n\nBootcamps aren't a requirement anywhere, and there are many roles that don't require a degree either, as long as you can hold your own in a technical discussion and/or test, or demonstrate your competence by showing us things you've built. (Note: this is getting harder as we see more generative AI submissions etc.)\n\nSo your options are:\n\n1. Do a bootcamp and use that to demonstrate your competency.\n2. Self-teach with online resources (of which there are plenty).\n\nEither way you'll probably want to build things to show if asked. However you learn, you should decide what area of dev you want to get into (e.g. web, mobile, desktop, embedded, distributed systems etc.) and start looking at job ads in that area. Narrow down the languages and tools that you see desired. Focus on learning how to use those. E.g. if you want to be a game dev (oof) you'll probably want to learn C++, maybe C#, maybe JS, depending on the platforms/engines you see jobs for... etc.\n\nOnce you can build things, apply to jobs that don't list a degree as a requirement. See where you get. Interview experience is never a bad thing so there's no real downside.",

If you know HTML and CSS you could skip that part of course and directly start with Javascript. They also have projects you have to do which start with stuff like Rock Paper Scissors and you end with a project at the end of the course where you have to build a full stack Social Network.

There are all kinds of ways to solve a problem, but programming includes a required strategy.  You must break large problems into smaller, more approachable, chunks.\n\nYou also have to be able to define the problem explicitly.  No relying on another human to intuit your intent.  Instructions much be clear and unambiguous.  There's a TikTok going around showing a teacher following written instructions to construct a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  With predictably comical results.  Most humans fail this, at least the first go.  Programmers don't.\n\nFinally, and this is a rare skill indeed, you must be able to diagnose problems.  If a program runs first go, great.  However, it's debugging where learning really happens.  Diagnostics, probably even more than solving the initial problem presented, is a valuable life skill.",

For example, if I want to write a function that calculates the cumulative age of all the users of the system, the input is the user list, and the output is a number. Then, I know that number needs to be a sum of each age of each user. So, I need to get user age from user entry. So, I need to compare their birth date with current date.

I got stuck in that pit for a long time.\n\nTake stabs at stuff on your own (ie, watch a tutorial, then put it away and try to recall by coding yourself - bonus points for meaningful variation from their example) and I promise you that muscle will grow pretty quickly.\n\nSomething more actionable that helps me a ton is writing out the comments for what needs to happen at each step, THEN flesh it out with code. Over time, I find myself doing that less and less as you tend to hit similar solution patterns.",

        "body": "Honestly, there is no such thing as a \"programmer's mindset\". That's a myth and a general excuse for people too lazy to invest the necessary effort, discipline, persistence, diligence, and work to learn.\n\nThere are things that can make learning easier, such as being a logically inclined person, but even that can be improved and learned.\n\nI am a firm believer that most (not all) people can actually learn programming to a certain degree. They won't all be able to reach a professional level, but they can definitely learn it.\n\nAfter all, programming is just creating and translating steps to solve a problem in such a way that the computer can execute these steps.\n\nWe humans solve problems all day long, just we mostly don't even notice it as it is intrinsic. We work in steps every single second of the day, but we don't realize it.\n\nLearning programming is learning to consciously devise steps, to utilize our intrinsic ability to think in steps consciously.\n\nMost new learners focus way too much on the *code*, on the *implementation* in a *programming language*, which is only the last part of the process. Sure, it is absolutely necessary to learn a *programming language*, but after all this is just very limited vocabulary and very simple grammar.\n\nThe real part of programming happens way before the code. It is the process of analyzing, breaking apart problems/tasks and solving them in sequences of discrete steps (again, a skill that we generally are intrinsically good with) that *then* can be *implemented* in any programming language.\n\nHere is also the problem with most tutorials and with many, even high quality courses: they focus too much on the code and too little on the design, on guiding the learner to devise the solutions.\n\nWhen I started out with programming, there were no tutorials. There was no internet. There were barely any knowledgeable people in my (rural) area. It was way back in the first half of the 1980s in the advent of the \"home computers\" (Commodore ViC20, C64, BBC micro, Acorn, Amstrad CPC-464, etc.). All I had was the BASIC (programming language) manual that came with my computer and a lot of curiosity. A bit later, we had some \"programming\" lessons (in double quotes because it was more a joke than anything serious) at school - one lesson per week where 8 people were crammed around 4 Apple II Europlus computers where we initially learnt AppleSoft Basic and later UCSD Pascal. Our teacher made us draw flow charts before we were even allowed anywhere near the computer. This seriously helped. Using a visual representation of the steps to solve our tasks made us think more about the actual steps than about their *implementation* in a programming language.\n\nFlow charts, Nassi-Shneiderman charts, bulleted lists, pseudo-code, all of these help and are somewhat underrepresented in modern computer learning. If people started out learning these for short time, they would learn much easier and much faster as most learners don't fail at the *languages*, but fail on *programming*.\n\nThe above is also the reason Harvard chose to start with *Scratch* for their famous CS50 course. It is a visual programming language (in the style of Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams) that lets the learners focus on the *algorithm* on the *steps* instead of on an actual *programming language* with its keywords and grammar. Yes, Scratch comes across as childish because after all it was designed by the MIT to teach young kids programming, but that is actually the biggest advantage of it. Way too many people dismiss Scratch as childish and useless, yet, had they invested a couple hours with it, they would have seen its value.\n\nWay too many posts here are in the tone of \"I've learnt programming language X, Y, and Z, but still cannot program\". Why? Because they all focused on the wrong thing. They focused on the *implementation*, on the *end product*, on the completed car, instead of focusing on the *design process, the considerations, the decisions* that ultimately *lead* to the *implementations*.\n\nSimilarly, way too many people claim \"they can *read and understand* code, but not *write* it\". Similarly, just because one can *read and understand* novels it doesn't automatically enable them to *write* meaningful, comprehensive, fully developed ones.\n\nThen, we have the \"I've watched X tutorials, read Y books, but cannot program\" people. Yes, sure, you know the theory, but you have never applied your skills in practice. This is like sitting in the desert and watching countless Olympic Splash Diving videos and reading all about it. Unless you get wet and actually do it, everything will just be plain theory and you will fail miserably in practice.\n\nPractice is the key. Even a step further: independent practice. It's not *copying* tutorial code after tutorial code. It's sitting down, thinking about something to program and starting working on it, without tutorials, without AI (don't get me started on that for learners), only with one's own work.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with tutorials for a *certain use case*, e.g. for small, detailed, specific parts where one is unsure, but not for entire projects, e.g. the typical \"how to build X in language Y\" ones. If you need something special, e.g. \"how to work with SQLite tables in Python sqlite3\" or something alike, tutorials, blogs, etc. are perfectly fine.\n\nToo many people fall into *tutorial hell* because they don't dare to just simply start working on their own. They are afraid of not achieving their goals, they are afraid of failure, which is the completely wrong mindset for programming. Failure is an important part of learning. It is *gained experience*. It is equally important to know how not to do something as how to do something.\n\nThen, we have the \"do projects\" people who think that projects need to be huge, complex beasts and that instantly get discouraged by that thought. Again, wrong mentality. Every single program, no matter how small, is a project. One can only grow with their projects. People need to start small and simple and then work their way up to gradually larger and more complex projects.\n\nThen, we have the people who despair because they see the huge amount that is there to learn and only look at the summit, at the vast mountain of learning ahead of them instead of looking at the *path* ahead. One does not climb a mountain by just focusing on the summit. One climbs a mountain by looking at the path ahead and taking one step after the other.\n\nThen, we have the ones who declare \"programming isn't for me\" after investing mere *hours* (couple days/weeks) without much effort. Learning programming takes effort and doesn't come natural.\n\n*Fast tracking* in programming doesn't work (it actually doesn't work in any trained skill). There is no 0 to 100 in no time. Learning anything is a marathon, not a sprint. Slow and steady wins the race.\n\n> Recommend any books, courses, etc. that helped you most.\n\nHere is a knack. The most helpful books have actually fairly little to do with *programming*. They are about the *design*, the steps before the actual programs.\n\nThe typical recommendations for this are:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nAnd if you're hardcore: \"The Art of Computer Programming\" by Donald Knuth et.al.",

Someone posted a question asking something along the lines of 'What is the most important trait in a programmer?' and the most upvoted answer by a country mile was simply 'Perserverance'. It's euphoric when all the parts of a solution click into place and we get to sit back and watch it fire on all cylinders, but man it's a rough road to get there at times. The ability to stick with it when everythings broken and nothing makes sense is crucial.\n\nThat leads me nicely onto the second one really - embracing and even celebrating failure. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist that has a few podcasts on how learning works, and listening to him explain that it's repeated failure that triggers the learning process really changed my attitude and I wish I'd embraced it sooner. There's a quote along the lines of 'The master has failed more times than the apprentice has even tried', and whilst I probably spread my interests too thinly to master anything in particular, I'm doing my best to fail my way there.",

But to be of any use to anyone, you'll need to break both of those down into separate smaller problems - how to make bolognaise sauce and how to cook spaghetti. \n\nThe spaghetti is fairly easy (assuming you're using dried) - boil some water, add salt, add the spaghetti and cook for 10 mins.

And sometimes those ways aren't actually very productive, or sometimes those ways are productive for them but only because they think of things in an unusual way, and sometimes someone thinks of a new way that works for a lot people and everyone gets excited about this new way for a while until other people figure out the new way's short comings and go back to looking for better ones.\n\nEven in math, it's arbitrary. You only have clarity because you declare it by fiat--you make up some premises and rules because you think they are interesting or they will be informative in some way, then you try to figure out all the consequences of the rules you made up. A lot of math is about just using existing rules to figure out new things within that ruleset, and a lot of different math is thinking of entirely new rulesets that seem interesting and generative.\n\nProgramming, and trying to define encapsulation is more like the second kind of math.",

At the time these words were coined, Fortran and COBOL were the dominant programming languages, and they were extremely barebones compared to the modern versions of those languages. It's hard to fathom just how much we take for granted with modern programming languages today.\n\nIn terms of encapsulation, folks were mostly just proposing what we now think of as modules or classes. Basically, the idea boils down to creating public facing APIs that do not expose their inner variables. I like [this source](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/01-objects/02-encapsulation/) which quotes from some of the originators of OOP-- Dave Parnas and Alan Kay. \n\n> Parnas and his peers pushed for not just hiding the data, but also how the data was manipulated. By hiding these implementation details, they could prevent programmers who were used to the globally accessible variables of early programming languages from looking into our code and using a variable that we might change in the future.\n\nBarbara Liskov is another big name in the OOP world, and [she covers encapsulation in this fantastic paper](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/barbara-liskov/data-abstraction-and-hierarchy.pdf)\n\n> For abstraction to work, implementations must be encapsulated. If an implementation is encapsulated, then no other module can depend on its implementation details. Encapsulation guarantees that modules can be implemented and reimplemented independently; it is related to the principle of “information hiding” advocated by Parnas [15].\n\nThose three formed the basis of all modern OOP concepts. They are the definitive sources. I think much of the confusion comes from the second wave of folks who implemented the popular languages and who each definitely went their own way. Because their languages are so popular, their opinions are almost equally valid despite the fact that they all disagree with each other on minor things.\n\n- Bjarne Stroustrup\n- James Gosling\n- Brad Cox\n- Bertrand Meyer\n\nAs a side note, when discussing design patterns, there are a few definitive sources:\n\n- [Design Patterns](https://www.javier8a.com/itc/bd1/articulo.pdf) by the Gang of Four\n- Pattern Oriented Software Architecture, most notably volumes [one](https://daneshjavaji.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sznikak_jegyzet_pattern-oriented-sa_vol1.pdf) and [two](https://archive.org/details/patternorienteds0000unse_u5t3)\n- [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZoranLi/Books1/master/Patterns%20of%20Enterprise%20Application%20Architecture.pdf)\n\nHowever, most of those were written over twenty years ago, so [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/) is a good resource for putting these concepts into a modern context.",

Lots of people look down their noses at php, because it's been around for a long time and has some older concepts in it.  That's kind of like looking down your nose at railroads because they use tech that's been around for many decades.\n\nPython / Flask or Python / Django are pythonic, always good. \n\nI guess I'd go with Javascript / nodejs / express or C# / Dotnet to learn the most. \n\nAlmost all real-world backend development involves SQL to hold your data.",

You download an *SDK* (software development kit)\n2. You write your code\n3. You compile/package it (or not, depending on the language)\n\nFirst off, what you're downloading is not the language, as that is more of an abstract concept, it's software that uses the language to build software. That can include an interpreter (e.g. with Python), a compiler (c), a runtime (java), and other tools such as a debugger.\n\nWriting your code is what you do with e.g. pycharm, but you can do that with anything. At the end of the day, what only matters is the content of the files, so whether you write it with pycharm, notepad, visual studio, or Morse code doesn't matter (it matters to you of course, not to the machine).\n\nAnd then there's what you're actually inquiring about. This steps is what depends most on the technology you're using. With Python, there isn't really anything more to do: you write your scripts, ...and that's it. You just run them and that's your software. That makes it easy and convenient, but not very user friendly which is one reason why you generally don't use python (directly) for user facing applications. For java, the final step is compiling into jar files, or an exe that will use the jar. That's already what you're doing when testing it while writing the code. The only difference is you might be including or removing some stuff from the final binary that you ship to users. Similarly for other compiled languages such as c and c++, it's the same story. The only difference is, you have to compile for each configuration (architecture, os, etc.), but don't need the user to download a runtime. Then for web stuff like JavaScript, it's a bit more complex since you have to host the website on the internet if you want people to access it. But here it's actually the most similar to what you were describing: you do use a software that brings your software to life, the browser! It's a bit similar to Java's runtime but way more involved \n\n\nI hope this kind of makes sense? It's hard to explain without knowing what you know and understand but hopefully I gave a somewhat clear picture of how it works. And don't worry about not understanding all of it, the world of software is vast and complex and developing software is as much about writing the code than it is about the final steps of deployment!",

Make a website. It will cost you $10/year for your own domain name like Grumpy\\_Gremlin49.com, and $5 - 10/month to host the website. You'll need to learn some HTML and CSS to design the content, but most of the logic can be implemented in Python. The best part about the web is that it's the easiest for end users - they just type in your url and they're immediately using your app.\n\n2. Make a mobile app. For iOS it costs $99 to become a developer. You either make an iOS or Android only app using the special languages and frameworks designed for that, or you use a cross-platform framework designed to let you build an app once. There's a framework for making mobile apps with Python (Kivy) but it's not very professional. You upload your app to the play store / app store and then users can download it and use it.\n\n3. Make a desktop app. You can do that with Python. The main problem is getting it to users. You'd need a website to distribute it (see #1), and browsers and virus scanners will try to stop users from installing and running it. This is a fine solution for sending to a friend or making an internal app for a business, but these days making a good cross-platform desktop app for end users is a real pain. If you want to make an app for the Mac or Microsoft app stores, that does solve the virus scanner problem but it limits what your app is allowed to do.\n\nSo your next step is to pick one. The more specific the better. Pick something like web or iOS. Don't say \"all of the above\". Start somewhere.",

This is to ensure that, when running in production mode/env, things continue to work. These steps will include a task that's referred to as packaging. One of the mechanisms to do this is to containerize your application so that all system dependencies are bundled into the container (Docker is one of the easiest containerization tools; if you want, you should research Docker and Dockerfile).\n\nAfter the above packaging step (the usual artifact at the end of this stage is a deployable unit, in this case called a \"container image\"), you will need to then research how/where to host your application. If you are targetting running this code in the cloud (say AWS for eg), you will then need to research and decide whether you want to use Elastic Container Service (ECS) or a kubernetes-based solution. If going with ECS, most of the infrastructure-provisioning will already be taken care of - you will simply sign up for an AWS account, and then configure what tier you want to choose (depending on how heavy your application is and also depending on volume of users). Then comes the actual deployment.\n\n  \nI have skipped some steps like unit testing, CI builds, connection to a database, security (both runtime/dynamic scans and static scans). Depending on your comfort level and (I assume) your aim to get to a full-fledged application, you will need to research these as well. Ofc, if your application needs a UI, and assuming your python code is simply exposing API endpoints, you will then need to research react / angular / nextjs / vuejs /  etc (javascript frameworks) that will be used to build the UI for your application. That codebase will also follow a similar pattern of running the app, packaging, hosting, testing, etc.",

        "body": "Changing a language is kind of dangerous. Imagine a language changed every 3 years. You write a bunch of code this year. Three years from now, they change it, and now your code is broken. Does that seem reasonable? Many beginners feel code changes and they want to learn the latest, not realizing, using the same argument, that in a few years, they'd have to learn something new because the current stuff \"became obsolete\".\n\nOf course, 20 years is a long time, but languages that last time often change without breaking.\n\nFor example, Java has come out with new versions over the past 30+ years. Still, in principle, code written back then would still run now. The biggest changes occurred roughly 20 years ago when generics were introduced. Yes, there are a some other features that came out, but if you stuck mostly to that technology, you'd still be decently fine in Java. You'd only add to that knowledge instead of throwing it away.\n\nKeep in mind that code tends to stay around for long periods of time. Code can last 20 years or even longer. If you had to rewrite that code just to keep it up-to-date, that would be crazy amounts of unnecessary work. Beginners think new code is written all the time. They hear Rust is big, so they think millions of lines of Java code are tossed out, and they rewrite it all, not realizing how hard it is to rewrite code. If it took years to write, it takes years to rewrite.\n\nNow, there are things that have gotten old, but mostly in web technology. Even so, some still hangs around. I thought PHP went away 20 years ago. It's still around. People still use it because web sites were written 20 years ago. Sure, everyone tells you to learn React or something newer.\n\nThere was a posted months ago that wanted to learn Carbon, Google's answer to C++. It's not even been released, had no compiler that was available, and is still (for all I know) in limbo today. If they just learned C or Java, they'd be in better shape.\n\nAlso, many programmers learn more than one language, so even if you never use C again, learning to program translates (somewhat) to learning new languages, so it's not wasted time even if you think it is wasted time. The fact is, to learn programming, you will ultimately \"waste time\". Avoiding mistakes often means avoiding learning.",

It’s free and gives a solid introduction to computers and programming.\n\nAfter that, it’s kind of a “choose your own adventure,” so to speak. Think about what you want to do, web dev, software engineering, IT, etc. Then go to nostarch.com and find a book that matches your interest. Start working through it, build your own projects, and network to land an entry-level job.\n\nIt’s tough right now since the tech industry’s going through a downturn, but it’s definitely not impossible.\n\nIf you have the money and the opportunity get a CS degree it will legitimize you.",

My honest advice for you is to try and calm your anxieties for now and build a good relationship with programming. Go and pick a youtube tutorial Playlist you like, familiarize yourself with compilers/code editors, and just practice the basics like variables and loops. \n\nDon't try and make it into homework or work, just have fun with it, make it low stakes. If you like podcasts or lofi play some in the background while messing with some loops to familiarize yourself with them. Write a loop, change the variables. Add stuff, if it breaks, oh well, start over, delete the whole loop and write it again and start testing new stuff out.

I know it sounds cliche, but you'll never be happy doing things to prove your worth to other people. I wasted a lot of time and opportunities in my 20s because I couldn't learn that lesson. Maybe consider pivoting your degree to design (some uni's have game design specific courses) or to something that would better suit storytelling for game development. \n\nMy degree was in IT with a focus in programming and software engineering. To me the hardest thing in my program was understanding the \"thought\" process behind solving problems with code. A great way to practice this for me was actually playing the game Human Resource Machine on Steam. It forces you to \"think\" and \"problem solve\" in a way that is really beneficial to coding. The reason I harpe on this is because to me, my C# and Python classes were pretty similar. The foundation of WHAT you were doing was the same, but the syntax you use to execute it is different.",

For example, football, cooking, wrestling, gaming, etc. Take gaming for example, I’ve been playing runescape lately and enjoying that. I thought of an idea where you can select the items you want to upgrade to and it will tell you exactly the costs and items to upgrade it with and give a plan on that.\n\nWith any project break the idea / problem down to smaller objectives you can easily do. For the above I would do something like:\n* Hard code the upgrade data and item list for now\n* Create a function that can calculate the upgrade route of selected items\n* Display the items that you can select \n* Display the upgrade route once items are selected\n\nNow always keep your project simple and hard coded, then you can start adding improvements. For example I can connect it to a database, maybe supabase or MySQL or mongodb, etc. I can also connect it to authentication so users can save their ideal upgrade builds, presets, etc.\n\nYou want to always start small, then incrementally add to it. By adding overtime, that’s when a project gets complex. Even with the complex projects you mentioned, if you break them down into parts they’re actually very simple.\n\nYou have HTML, CSS and JS knowledge, so I’d recommend you pick up a framework like React / Next.js, Angular or Vue. I’d recommend you try all three with a basic project then you’ll get a feel on which one you’d like to use long term.\n\nIf you want some project ideas give a shout on what you enjoy and I can hit you back with some ideas. Try not to use AI during this period, use things like documentation, googling, books. Then once you’re comfortable you can use AI for research but don’t heavily rely on it for your code, you want to use it to help you grasp concepts. The key thing for you right now is to learn problem solving while you’re doing these projects.",

You won't regret doing things you enjoyed, unless you used that as a way of **avoiding** doing things you needed to do. If it will help you in your career (I think only you can judge that), so much the better.",

I don’t regret a second of it. I ended up getting a job working with the same technology and so now I get paid to play with the technology I was happily doing for fun in my free time. Employer loves my passion for the tech, and those projects let me speak about these things in interviews very well. \n\nIn my second year summer, I built an Arduino project that would present you with a math problem and you had to put in the answer using binary (with twos complement for negative numbers) by clicking physical buttons. It tracked the time spent on the answers, and I timed myself doing it sober for about 20 minutes, ingested a shit ton of cannabis and did it again. Then I spent the next few days analyzing the difference in performance using Python. I can never bring that up in an interview but I genuinely enjoyed doing it. I don’t regret it. \n\nOverall my point is you’ll never regret having fun. I don’t regret the time I spend playing video games, and I definitely don’t regret any time spent that has practical benefits to me. You should be psyched that you’re enjoying this stuff. You have the “knack”.",

If the new size is still smaller than what you originally asked for, it's possible that realloc() might not do anything.\n* The total amount of memory used will increase with n, but because it's freeing what it had before, at most \"n\" memory will ever be taken up.\n* You might think 1 + 2 + 3 +... + n is some sort of exponential sort of thing, but it's just n\\^2.

Apply your own thought process. You don't need to understand a programming language or concept to understand the logic behind the topics you are thinking about. Lock yourself in a room and think about the problem from the base case.\n\nFor example, why do you need a temp variable to store values when swapping in an array? Well, imagine you are organizing a stack of books. You want to move the one in the 5th position to the 3rd position in the stack. So aks yourself, what do you do? \n\nYou have some options! First, you could pick them up in your hands and move them to where you want them. Or second, you could pick one up, lets say the 2nd one, and shove it in after the 5th book, shoving every other book after it down, then take the 5th book and put it back where the 2nd book was. Or visa versa.\n\nSo which option is better? It's a lot harder to move a bunch of books after the 5th book just to shove that 2nd book in there. So lets pick them up and swap instead.\n\nYou pick up book 2, pick up book 5, and swap them. Ok, so if you wanted to do that on a computer, what's different? Well, you used your hand to store the books temporarily, so it's clear you have to put them somewhere when you swap. But actually, we can do better! Because in a computer things don't physically exist and it's all information, we can just pick one of them up, and copy the other into it's place. \n\nNow you can ask yourself, what would happen if I didn't pick up that book before copying over it? Well you'd no longer know what the book was, right? You'd lose all the content, all the pages, the title, everything about that book would have been replaced by the book you just copied into its place. \n\nThis is the thought process you have to apply to *any problem* you don't understand. Stand with the fundamentals. This actually has a name; \"principles first approach\". This is what I employ to most problems. As you gain more experience, you will start to see parallels and abstractions, and shortcuts you can take with the \"base case\".\n\nFor example, now that you know you need to store a variable temporarily, and you are asked how to swap elements in a binary tree, or rotate it, you can start your base case at the fact that you'll need at least one temporary variable.\n\nBest of luck \\~",

I am currently trying to learn go and A Tour of Go, Go by Example, and Learn Go with Tests are what I am currently trying to get into.

I'm a DevOps/Backend dev by trade so I'm privy to how expensive apps can get to run, but from what I did on Exercism it seems like a relatively simple platform, with an open-source CLI and a web app at its core.

If I had had the chance to go to school I probably would’ve leaned more towards computer vision, embedded, graphics/media or something else but being self taught I took the pragmatic approach to enter the web dev arena. \n\nSo my advice would be to pick up whatever interests you most, because that’ll make you happiest in the long run. If you are enamored by the high salaries in big tech then stick to web dev or AI but plenty of places pay highly for specialized and niche knowledge.",

CSS is used to make them look nice. There are some data structures there (headings, paragraphs, captions, images, all that), but it is a stretch to claim you can code up actual algorithms in HTML/CSS. There's a lot more to programming than those. Javascript, for just one example.\n\nWhat kind of programs would you like to make for your users? Web apps? Games? Mobile apps?

In the old days, whiteboard/quiz type questions were how we tried to see if someone really could code, but then everyone just started studying specifically for the type of questions that would be asked. \n\n\nI'm really not going to spend more than five minutes looking at a git repo or even a live website or whatever because there are just too many applicants and plenty of applicants are just going to clone somebody else's open source project. \n\n\nIt's just something I would ask you about in the interview. I would expect you to be mildly passionate about it, because it's your project, and I would expect you to be able to speak intelligently about how you built it, on a technical level. \n\n\nCounter-intuitively an amazing project can be a reason we don't hire you.\n\n\nIf we hire you, we would ask you to sign a non-compete and claim ownership of everything you develop. These contracts weren't always enforceable, and it might be different in your location, but the company wants you to give up your project and work full time on whatever they care about. \n\n\nIf your project is so good, so impressive, so huge, that we think in 6 or 12 months it might take off and you would quit to pursue it, you would be a high risk hire. We want the applicant who will stick around for a handful of years. \n\n\nOnly twice have I witnessed this. The first was a guy who clearly wanted to develop games. He had an indie game he was in love with and basically admitted he just wanted to make games but had run out of money. The other guy quit his full time job to launch his own app, wrote the app, and didn't sell as many copies as he thought. He was looking for a job but he was clearly super passionate about his app and wanted to keep working and focusing on it. \n\n\nAs a person, and a developer who has my own side projects, I get it. We just need some money to pay the bills...but as an employee tasked with hiring good candidates... Those people aren't likely to be the best options and selecting a bad hire reflects poorly on me.",

The commits have date time stamp, author name and email address. To not dox your GitHub registration email address in your commits history, there's a setting to generate no-reply garbage email address.\n  \nUsers can add repository to their favourites by clicking a \"star\", there's a counter of how many users added the repository to their \"stars\", so it acts like popularity indicator.  \n  \nThere's a so called branches in repositories, there's a main branch called \"main\" or classically \"master\".  \n  \nUsers can \"fork\" a repository, it copies a repository to their own collection of repositories and after the forking the repository points to the original one with \"remotes\", it's an url of a git repository. You can make changes to this local version of a repository you just forked and then you proceed to make a commit describing what you just changed, then you create a \"pull request\". It's request that's sent to the \"remote\" repository to approve a \"pull\" from your commit, it means getting those chances to his repository.  \n  \nYou can turn your GitHub repository into a visitable web site with GitHub Pages. It servers your web site through a link like this:  \nhttps://<your_user_name>.github.io/<your_repo_name>/  \n  \nIt can only respond with a content of your files without dynamic functionality like databases and scripting languages.  \n  \nThe git is a program that you can use locally on your computer to version your software (or anything else) projects. It creates a folder in your repository named .git (that's hidden in non-Windows operating systems) where it stores file changes and everything about git project. If you don't want some files/folders to be uploaded to remote repo, you can define them in .gitignore file. You can make git repo locally and then upload it to a GitHub (or other git repo hosting websites)  \n  \nGitHub adds more features to the git repositories than it's supported by a git itself, so it's recommended to manage a repo in a GitHub website.

        "body": "\\> What is a github post?\n\nNever really heard the term used in regards to github, so I'm not sure what you mean.\n\n\\> Is it called a repository\n\nA repository is a collection of files that are managed by version control. Git is a particular version control software that is very popular. Github is a place where you can store repositories online so that it's not just only on your computer. (To understand the difference, I've heard \"Git is to GitHub as Porn is to PornHub.\" Meaning that porn exists outside pornhub, it's just one place to keep it, which is what makes it analagous.)\n\n\\> And is there a way to bookmark and or like a repository just like you would like a Facebook post or something on Instagram?\n\nGithub has stars, \"watch\" toggles, forks, and you can just use any standard way you'd bookmark a webpage too of course.\n\n\\> Could someone just give me a short synopsis of some of the terminology used on the site?\n\nIf you learn git separately from github, then I think most of the terms you'll understand.\n\nThe specialized terms are things like a \"pull request\" which wouldn't make sense on just your own computer, but that is you submiting code for someone elses' project and, well, requesting that they pull it into their project. That could be bug fixes or feature implementations or documentation or anything else that makes sense for the project that the original author/maintainer might be interested in. There's also all kinds of options for automatically testing or building, or project management, etc. Frankly no one uses every feature, just the features relevant to their own workflow.\n\n\\> I want to use it more but I just don’t understand any of the different things you can do.\n\nMost of the things it can do won't make sense without knowing git.\n\n\\> Just to give you an idea, I didn’t build my PC just because I didn’t want to mess it up.\n\nEntirely understandable (although maybe I'm more reckless than you since I'm currently trying to fix my GPU with a soldering iron lol), and actually tangentially related to one of the problems version control/git aims to solve. By using git you can keep a history of all the versions of a file with a little note about what changed. That means if something gets messed up, you can maybe not \"easily\" but relatively easily go back to a version where everything in the file/project was in a good state and move on from there rather than hopiing you kept your \"known\\_good\\_backup\\_file.py\" actually unmodified.\n\n\\> main features someone like me who is not a programmer would need to know to work my way around it.\n\nHonestly as a non-programmer probably the main thing to do would be to submit \"issues\" for projects you use that you would notice a bug or miissing feature or whatever in. The exact way to do that varies for every project since everyone has their own preferences, but in general it's appreciated to get feedback from people actually using the tools you make.\n\n\\> I have used a couple posts to my benefit but each time had someone walk me through setting it up and after that, didn’t have to revisit it so it’s all a foreign language to me.\n\nUnfortunately git is just weird, and it takes a little bit of time forcing yourself to use it to get used to it. Ultimately there's like 5-10 common commands but there's way more than that in the tool so it's more intimidatting than it needs to be. Some non-programmers like book authors sometimes appreciate the \"time travel\" ability that it gives them, so it's possible that even without writing code that there's something youd' appreciate using version control for which would help you build up a little more of a habit of using git.",

Right now you're stuck with all these separate pieces of a puzzle and you're finding it hard to see how they all fit. At times you will manage to fit some together and as you connect more pieces it will get easier and easier to find new connections. Focus on the fundamentals and try to have some sort of own project at the side that you can tinker with on your own when you feel like it.\n\nMy own experience - I found it hard when I had gotten my degree to structure and design code. Like you I felt frustrated and a bit lost. We had very briefly talked about the concept of Clean Code during one of the courses without going in-depth at all so I ordered and read the book. I found it to be extremely helpful and taught me structure and a bunch of common patterns and idioms when writing code in a very straightforward and helpful manner.\n\nLastly - if there was something that I wish the school had focused more on to prepare me and my fellow students for the real world, I'd wish we'd gotten more time to work with how online services talk with each other, what protocols do they use, how is information exchanged, request/response etc, as well as how you work with web/appservers etc. It was all very hand waved and the only server we had to setup was a light-weight Firebird local server to host our SQL-dbs.\n\nSo, personal opinion - focus on learning the programming fundamentals, read Clean Code, and check out how apps communicate with each other and get som practice doing that. Good luck!",

Do you see what they are?\n\nI personally find that:\n- Variables are often a matter of taste.\n- Good names can save you a lot of grief.\n- Variables that you assign an expression to, only to immediately return, provide little benefit over just retuning the expression directly.\n- Modifying a function argument by assignment is a bit subversive. Unless I'm cleaning up what I've been given or something, I rarely opt for it.\n- One-liners can be easier to read (up to a point!), but can be harder to debug.\n- Comments are best when they don't just repeat what the code is already telling you. Great comments are for tricky bits, and to explain the \"why\" behind the code.",

        "body": "It is relatively easy to write code that the computer understands. The computer doesn't really care about how many variables you use.\n\nIt is much more tricky to write code other humans can understand. This doesn't really matter in this toy problem, but becomes quite important in larger or longer-term projects.\n\nFor humans, giving names to things matters. It can be worth pulling outoart of a computation and assigning it to a variable *just to give it a name*. In this sense, variable names and function names serve a similar purpose to comments, but names are easier to keep up to date as the code evolves.\n\nHere is how I as a very experienced programmer would refactor that code if this were a production problem (untested):\n\n    import re\n    import sys\n\n    EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS = {\n        \":)\": \"🙂\",\n        \":(\": \"🙁\",\n    }\n\n    EMOTICONS_PATTERN = re.compile(\"|\".join(re.escape(e) for e in EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS)\n\n    def _emojify(text: str) -> str:\n        # see https://stackoverflow.com/a/2400577\n        return EMOTICONS_PATTERN.sub(\n            lambda m: EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS[m[0]],\n            text,\n        )\n\n    def main():\n        for line in sys.stdin:\n            print(_emojify(line))\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n\nThere are a couple of fundamental differences that you might find distracting – using a replacement table instead of `str.replace()`, or transforming all input instead of prompting for a single line. The regex related stuff is a fixed pattern for applying multiple replacements to the same string.\n\nBut for the purpose of this discussion important observations are:\n\n* I think `_emojify()` is a better name than `convert()`. Converting *what*?\n* I decided against introducing additional local variables. They don't seem to add anything. In particular, naming a value just to immediately return it doesn't tend to provide much useful information to readers.\n* No comments like \"get input\". Comments are useful for providing information that's not visible in the code. If an `input()` function is called, I can already see that we're obtaining input. The thing that would benefit from a more detailed comment in my version would be the regex stuff, as this is highly non-obvious for people who don't already know this pattern. Unfortunately, this pattern has no name, but it has a canonical Stack Overflow answer.",

What you have to watch out for is\n\n* \"scope\" - the contexts that a name lives in, within a module/function etc., and\n* functions that change values, vs. return values.\n\nIn Python, when you assign a new value to the name \"user\\_input\", that is scoped in this case to the whole function.  In a larger function body, you might have loops etc., and you can negligently change a name that elsewhere you've been assuming represents its original value.  It's OK here, it could be a really bad move in another context.  You know, like old school guys like me will use 'i' for an index counter, and then use it again in another loop inside that, and that of course is not going to work right.\n\nFor the change/return thing ... Somewhat miscategorized as such, because what we have here is a function return.  But from an object method.  The .replace.replace thing Harvard handed you here, you have to decide what you think about that.  It's vaguely familiar as if imported from a \"functional programming\" model, and I think Python programmers commonly get some jollies from doing things like that.  But it's a little less transparent what's going on in an OOP object.method model and I personally don't get the attraction.  I might split that up into separate assignments to user\\_input\\*.  Consider how that would relate to your question - would you want to reuse user\\_input, or have a trail of new identifiers - user\\_input, user\\_input\\_with\\_happy, user\\_input\\_with\\_happy\\_and\\_sad ...?  Again here I'd reuse user\\_input, but in another context the more specific names might be more informative.",

CS50 is no joke, especially for beginners, and the fact that you’re not just watching but actively coding along *and* asking questions shows you're way ahead of just “passive learning.”\n\nYes, it *will* feel slow at first. You’re not nitpicking — you’re trying to build actual understanding, and that takes time. It’s 100% normal to not remember everything or to need to look things up multiple times. Everyone starts that way.\n\nIf you want to level up a bit without getting overwhelmed, here are a few simple tips:\n\n* **Keep a small notes doc** (which you’re already doing — big W)\n* **After each week**, try to build a *tiny* project using what you learned. Doesn’t need to be fancy — even a simple calculator or guessing game helps things stick.\n* **Don’t worry about memorizing syntax.** Focus on *what* each thing does and *why* it’s being used.\n* After a section, try explaining the concept to someone else (or even just to yourself out loud). It’s wild how much it helps.\n\nYou're doing the hardest part right now: showing up consistently. Trust me, this isn’t wasted time — it’s the foundation that makes future stuff way easier to grasp.

I watch it however many times i need to, I watch other related videos, I look up things i need a little more detail on. Its good cuz, I know the thing that I want to code, isn't exactly the same as whats being taught to me in the video. At the end i've gathered bits and pieces of what I like from each piece of content.\n\nand then, with AI, i describe my understanding of that thing, and i have it just confirm my understanding. this leads to a lot of back and forth with AI because now i'm able to discuss the topic with it, adjust my understanding, correct the AI where it sounds wrong, and by the end of it, even if its not fully fledged out - i have a plan\n\nonce i start coding, i have a stronger sense of the separate pieces of the puzzle that i need to build, and it becomes way easier to connect them all together",

(find a particular value, compute sum of everything, find minimum). Also look into writing recursive code with an explocit stack instead of using function calls. It makes you understand much better how these things work.\n\n\n2/ learn debugging. And here i mean two different things. Learn how the debugger work to step through code and inspect memory. But also learn how to use invariants and how to verify them at runtime. This will help make sure that the code detects the first time it is in a state that is incoherent with assumptions made.",

They're more like a tree in performance, but it's just a linked list with shortcuts. Have you tried implementing a binary search over a sorted array? This is kind of what a binary search tree is doing.\n\nLisp has a built-in \"dotted\" notation for cons cells, so you can just write example trees out to test your lookups, for example. Maybe try implementing a scapegoat tree in Scheme before trying again in whatever language you're using. Scheme also kind of forces you to use recursion, which is what you need to process recursive data structures like trees.",

Once you’re solid with that, binary trees become easier: it’s just two references instead of one (left and right).\n\nThen, build a simple Node class for your tree. Keep it minimal: just value, left, and right.\n\nNow, draw a small tree on paper and simulate what’s supposed to happen step by step:\n\nHow insertion flows,\n\nHow recursion works (base case + call stack),\n\nHow traversal happens (in-order, pre-order, post-order).\n\n\nUse a debugger or print() statements to watch the logic unfold live. That’s how you bridge the gap between understanding the concept and writing working code.\n\nFinally — don’t rush. Trees teach you recursion, memory structure, and flow control all at once. So if it’s hard, that just means you’re learning something real.\n\nYou're closer than you think.\n\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a sample in Python or a visual breakdown. Happy to help",

        "body": "I professionally work on large codebase (~50+ million lines of code) containing a mix of backend and frontend code. We pretty much exclusively use plain-old dependency injection and do not quite use the service locator pattern.\n\nThis is partly due to the architecture of our codebase, which is a monorepo containing a bunch of microservices. That is, we have one giant repo where all code lives, and the code contains several thousand smaller programs that are managed by different teams and deployed independently at cadences picked by the owning team. (The monorepo + microservice approach makes it easier for each team to move independently while still making it easy to share + reuse + mass-refactor code, etc.)\n\nGiven this setup, having a central registry is not hugely useful because:\n\n1. If we create just one 'registry library' that everybody adds their thing to, it ends up introducing a major bottleneck to builds and tests. When we make a code change, our build system + CI pipeline tries building and testing only code that ends up depending on that code change in some way; having a single common module that nearly every microservice takes a dep on would add an unnecessary bottleneck.\n2. You don't really get much benefit out of having every single microservice create their own registry and register deps. If you're going through the hassle of this, you may as well just pass in those dependencies directly into your code and skip setting up the intermediary registry.\n\nBeyond this though, I personally think service locators are inferior to plain-old-code and dependency injection because:\n\n1. Having the dependencies be statically encoded in the source code instead of created dynamically via some magic framework makes it easier for IDEs and static analysis tools to determine where exactly different snippets of code are being used, programmatically update the code, more intelligently pick which tests must be run given certain code changes, perform type checking, etc. So, the less dynamic/runtime wiring we can have, the better.\n2. It also makes unit testing easier -- there's nothing simpler then just calling a plain-old-function or instantiating a plain-old-class. The less ceremony you can have, the better.\n3. Arguably service locators make it a little too easy to add new deps. Code that takes a large number of deps is usually a sign of poorly-designed code -- it should be broken up into smaller, better compartmentalized components. So, having a little bit of friction here seems like a pro, not a con.\n\nAll that said, it's true that these microservices need a way to communicate with each other -- need some sort of [service discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_discovery). This has less to do with code architecture and more to do with the reality that these microservices need to run on a fleet of many thousands of hosts, and so need a way of discovering which IP address any particular microservice replica is serving from at any given time.\n\nTo do this, we have microservices register their IP address in a system that's pretty similar to DNS; downstream microservices need to hard-code the specific service address and perform a lookup to talk to other microservices they take a dep on.\n\nIn fairness, the actual code to do all of the above can end up feeling pretty similar to the service locator pattern in practice -- it's just that instead of registering a pointer, we register IP addresses. So, I suppose we do use a variant of this pattern in practice.\n\n> are multithreaded\n\nI think multi-threadness is irrelevant here. If your code is multi-threaded, your deps need to be thread-safe, no matter how they're passed around.",

Because a service locator provides that. \n\nJust as an example with my context, I use service locators in game development to provide convenient access to main systems (audio, saving, scene loading). I don’t care about testing or have concerns with multi threading so it doesn’t factor into my decision. \n\nI use DI extensively in many other scenarios where I need to be explicit on my inputs.

        "body": "Dependency injection has some pros over the service locator pattern:\n\n1. **No hidden dependencies!** \\- You know exactly what dependencies an object has just by looking at its constructor, and what dependencies a method has just by looking at its parameter list. You don't have to read through all the implementation details, or figure out through trial-and-error, what services need to be registered in your service locator for things to not break at runtime. If all required dependencies are explicitly listed as constructor and method parameters, the compiler makes it basically impossible to try and construct an object or execute a method without having everything in the right place for it to work (at least if the services passed to the client themselves also use dependency injection, etc.).\n2. **Safer async initialization** \\- If a service returned from a service locator requires some sort of asynchronous initialization before all its methods are ready to be used, then it could easily lead to a situation where a client forgets to check some IsReady property before calling some method, resulting in bugs. Or even if the service is explicitly registered as wrapped inside a promise object, then all clients need the additional complexity of handling waiting for the service to become ready, and unwrapping it. With dependency injection you can naturally always just wait for all services to be fully ready before you even initialize the client and pass them to its constructor. Thus all clients' code can remain very simple and focused, and the asynchronous nature of a few services don't end up spreading around the code base, and causing the whole APIs of all their clients to also become asynchronous in nature.\n3. **Better support for multiple services of the same type** \\- with dependency injection, you can easily at any time pass completely different services to separate instances of the same client type. You can pass a default logger to most of them, but pass a more verbose logger to that one instance that you want to debug more closely right now. If you use a global service locator, then you might just be completely stuck with all instances of a client class being stuck using the same services at any given time. Or even if you use multiple separate service locators, it'll still probably be much way more complicated to swap the service of one client instance in some particular context - potentially even requiring some substantial architectural changes to pull it off.\n4. **Clients don't have to worry about lifetime management** \\- if a client pulls out a service from a service locator, how do they know if they should dispose of it once they no longer need it? Did they get a transient service, or is it a singleton shared between multiple instances? Does the service locator have to return some other information besides the requested service, so that this can be resolved? Do clients just always have to return all services to the service locator, just in case? With dependency injection all the complexity of lifetime management is pulled out from all the many clients in your codebase, and can be centralized into a smaller number of composition roots, where the lifetimes of all the different services is probably more clear.\n5. **Clear initialization order** \\- if services are initialized lazily by a service locator, in whatever order they're requested by clients, then their initialization order can become an unknowable, unpredictable black box, where the order of initialization can change drastically due to small changes in the implementation details of clients. This can potentially lead to random spooky-action-at-a-distance bugs, where a small change to some object causes a chain effect, resulting in some event being raised before some service has had time to subscribe to it, causing things to silently break. With (pure) dependency injection the initialization order is super clear, and doesn't just suddenly change \"by itself\" without you being aware of what has happened.",

Whether it's analyzing publicly available datasets, visualizing something you're personally interested in, or even cleaning and presenting data from a small business (if you can find one willing to let you play with their data), those projects will help you learn more deeply and give you something tangible to show potential clients or employers. It's possible to land jobs or freelance gigs within a year, especially when you can show consistent learning, project work, and a clear understanding of the fundamentals. Your lack of a tech or math background isn’t a dealbreaker. What matters most is how you build your practical skills and communicate them.",

Try projects like analyzing survey results, tracking local business trends, or visualizing your own spending data. These are simple but effective ways to learn and build a portfolio. One of my friends had no math or tech background and started with similar tools. She took an online course from a learning platform, studied for about 3 to 4 hours a day, and worked on small projects. Within 10 months, she landed a data analyst job at a mid-sized company.

Just not sure what kind of personal projects actually help when applying for junior or entry level roles.\n\nGenerally, I would focus on creating projects that:\n\n- Use the stack / technologies you want to use in practice, or want to get a job in. While not completely necessary, as you can show general software development aptitude by simply creating programs that work, having them also be using the technologies a company you are applying for immediately shows your general skill level to the person doing the interview with you.\n- Write applications that excite or interest you personally. You will find that in an interview just being able to talk about a project that interests you will convey genuine interest in our field of work. Personally as an interviewer, I am always very interested in hearing about projects people have written just because it interests them. \n- Document your projects, and make them representable. I like seeing Github URLs on applicant their CVs, but interviewers are likely not going to check out more than 1-3 projects. Pin or highlight the projects you are most proud of, provide them with good documentation, if possible with screenshots or in case of a web app: a demo website. Make it easy to run. Your goal is to entice the interviewer to check out the code, and maybe even clone your repo in order to do so.\n  - Your Emotion-AiCbot repo is a good example of this. Your custom-domain and medstuff repo's not so much. \n- Try and make your projects non-trivial. I do not get excited by projects like calculator or to-do apps. These are simple applications, and there are a bunch of prebaked tutorials for those on the internet. Created some niche application for your hobby, or which you use in your day-to-day life? Way more interesting.\n\n> I’m more into backend stuff, like APIs and automations, but I can handle some frontend too. Just not sure what kind of personal projects actually help when applying for junior or entry level roles.\n\nKnow that as a junior engineer, my expectation would be that you quickly pick up technologies and are a rapid learner. Try not to limit yourself too early in your development by preferring only certain types of task (e.g. back-end). Certainly do get proficient with at least one front-end technology, or you will not stand out among junior developers that are skilled in multiple domains.\n\nBest of luck.",

The only advice i can personally give is that it has been told to me that its okay to google some stuff when working. This is how you learn. You need to do something, you look for how to do it, and then next time you need to do it you know how. Make sure you're understanding why it works though and not just how to do it, thats a pitfall a lot of people fall into when learning anything. \n\nAlso I personally dont use ChatGPT to write any code. If i use it its usually for syntax issues (usually when learning a new language) or as a substitute for google. \n\nSorry I cant help more and im personally wondering the same question tbh. Its definetly hard to know when your competant enough to try and work in this field, but just make sure your always learning and try to always have fun doing it. :)\n\nEDIT: Typos",

You don't need to know everything as Google and AI exists (no programmer knows everything) but you need to build projects to learn how a project is constructed from start to finish and what is also important is that you don't use AI to solve problems. Struggling is part of the learning process and you only can learn debugging for example if your code, that you wrote yourself doesn't work and you go through it line by line trying to understand why the output is not what you want it to be. Like mentioned above theory is important too as you need to know that certain syntax even exists but then using this syntax so your brain gets used to it you can only learn by doing projects. Once you think you learned Javascript or Typescript for example (like you said you did), start a project and see if you know what to do. If the answer is you don't know then you need to spend more time with it until you can build a project yourself before moving on. \nI think even if you can get a job you will feel much more comfortable if you have done several projects.\n Like many here say, programming is not a sprint but a marathon. It takes a long time to learn properly.",

The second is the CometD protocol which keeps a long lived socket open between client and server that closes after either a three minute timeout or when a “push” update is returned. This is inefficient in terms of open tcp sockets for the server and cannot massively scale but can support client counts in the thousands or tens of thousands.\n\nIf you control the servers, you would allow inbound connections to the database and secure that point using a firewall and likely a vpn for an internal server. You would also strictly authenticate connections including restricting senders to known ip ranges. A common strategy is to route traffic through the vpn and only permit connections from it unless a device is physically in an office and authenticated on a trusted network.",

Having a solution to a problem is very different than taking that solution and selling it to enough people to make a living. If you spend an extended period of time grinding on the project, my advice is that you should be doing it because you're motivated to learn, not because you want to make it your job.\n\nI've always learned while passionately building a project that would eventually get thrown away, and I've spent a lot of time convincing myself that these things would pan out, but that's not really how the world works unfortunately.\n\nTLDR: Look for a job, build as much as you can, maybe get hired, see what professional development is like.",

You cannot blindly trust that LLMs generated code is correct, especially if you are planning to deploy your app. Code may contain vulnerabilities (e.g. vulnerable for SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, etc), all kinds of bugs and missing features. Who know, maybe even real API keys that found their way into the codebase somehow.\n\nThat means, that we should still know fundamentals. Not sure what you meant by low-level stuff, but learning definitely will not hurt. Just make sure to apply your knowledge in practice and build something. That will improve your understanding of the material and help it stick in your memory for longer. Don't be afraid to reinvent the wheel for the sake of deeper understanding. At the same time, try to build something new, useful and challenging to really stress test your skills and \"level up\".\n\nThe difficult thing is to focus on cultivating the right kind of skills and fundamentals. There is just so much to learn and to know. I don't know the answer either, besides the obvious: learn 1-2 programming languages well enough, learn data structures, pick a framework, know network protocols (at least HTTP), maybe OAuth, maybe cybersecurity fundamentals could be useful. Yeah, take this with a grain of salt. I actually started reading \"Structured computer organization\" by Tanenbaum. That maybe useful for low-level and system programming, i guess?\n\nThat said, I would suggest to give these AI tools a try every once in awhile if you haven't done so yet. Just to see what they are capable of.\n\nI shared your hesitation at first. Then, I tried it recently and found it quite useful for generating boilerplate code and writing tests. No agentic stuff, just multi-line autocomplete mode. That way, you still are in control and can immediately review the suggested code snippet, but it saves you a lot a hand-typing.\n\nAs for the AI, I am not gonna be a judge of whether the hype is justified or not. But, people do use these LLM-powered assistants in professional setting, at least to a degree. It's worth to at least keep tabs on from time to time.",

Developing a private-use plugin is much less work than developing something up to the standards for insertion into the public https://wordpress.org/plugins/ repository.\n\nYou could even do this in just one php file. There's a starting point template for that in the \"Hello Dolly\" plugin here. https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/6.8.2/src/wp-content/plugins/hello.php\n\nWordPress has a REST API subsystem that's set up so a plugin can extend it by adding one or endpoints to do what you need an API to do. https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/\n\nYou can use short-lived access tokens (WordPress calls them \"nonces\") to authenticate access to your REST API. https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/nonces/  Your plugin will generate them as part of generating your web pages containing code that uses the REST API, and your REST API code will check them for validity.

It’s unfortunate, but the market has figured out it can get away with it. \n\nI wish you the best. There is life after tech. Besides, coding for yourself is far more rewarding.",

        "body": "The whole industry has been feeding on its own grift for a while now.\n\nEver tried explaining SCRUM to someone who doesn't work in tech? They'll look at you like you take the short bus to the office.\n\nThe average software engineer now applies to over 400 job postings for every interview. And many of those interviews are what, 6 rounds? No other industry comes close to that. And it's not an imbalance of supply and demand. It's a hiring practices problem.\n\nDon't even get me start on leetcode. Yes, I know it's supposed to weed out the fakers so the company doesn't end up with a bunch of devs who can't code their way out of a paper bag. And yet those same companies still end up developing massive piles of overcomplicated crapware. Almost like the devs aren't the bottleneck. Also, senior devs can spot the fakers a mile away.\n\nAnd now with the vibe coding. I'm seriously considering starting a new service that just fixes the messes people make with their vibe coded apps. I bet I'd make bank by advertising it with a bunch of LinkedIn posts saying how the service will \"take their vibe code to the next level\". Cannot wait for that bubble to burst.\n\nThing is, it wasn't like this even 10 years ago. These are all problems the tech industry has created for itself.\n\nNow for the fun part. To people outside the industry, your skills are like magic. And it's not even the complicated CS stuff.\n\nDo you have any idea how many small businesses out there are paying marketing agencies to do SEO for them, yet they don't even have access to their own traffic data? And the agencies make up excuses because really they're just Wordpress shops that can't get their tracking pixels hooked up to Salesforce correctly so the data is useless and they can't say that part out loud.\n\nThe reason so many people are talking about AI (aside from the grifters and enterprise salespeople) is because they want to be able to do the things you can do. They want their tech to work the way they think it should, yet every time they talk to a dev shop about it they end up talking about nonsense like user stories and sprint timelines.\n\nIt took me way too many years to figure this out. The kicker was when I was working as consultant and somehow ended up on a small side project that was basically setting up a SquareSpace site for a local business. Our sales guy managed to bill it out at $150/hour. For a SquareSpace site. My techie brain thought this was a drastic overcharge because I thought the whole point of SquareSpace was that you didn't have to hire someone to do it for you. But for that local business that sold old muscle car parts, SquareSpace was over their head and it was worth $150/hour to have me do it for them.\n\nEventually I got fed up building the umpteenth enterprise iOS app so I quit working with companies that do anything enterprise-y at all. It's too soul sucking.\n\nAnd you know what? Turns out it's not so hard to sell my skills to non-tech companies. What I think is easy is what they think is magic. That's a win-win.\n\nThey don't buy unit tests (not that I want to write them), but they're game for anything that helps their sales funnel.\n\nMy advice for anyone burning out in the tech industry is this. You probably see your skills and dedication to quality as an investment for a company. They probably see you as a cost center. So next time you get stressed by the nonsense, start thinking about how to apply what you know in ways that would help non-tech companies. Think outside the box. Then do the hard part and reach out to a few of them. You might be surprised at what you learn and end up with a whole new perspective on how all this really works.\n\nIf nothing else, the experience will certainly help you write better Upwork proposals.",

To quickly lookup syntax, or simple things that nobody memorizes?\n\nOr are they going to let them prompt engineer the entire answer to the problem?\n\nBecause if it's the former, that already happens today.... except it's not AI. It's asking your interviewer. In my experience, interviewers don't care if you have some dumb syntax memorized, they don't care if you stumble on how to do X in Y language. Those things don't matter on the job, and they don't matter in the interview. It's the problem solving they care about. Usually interviewers make it clear you can ask them syntax questions like that, or other nudges AI-as-a-tool would normally help you with. I've also been in interviews where they're totally fine with you googling, you just have to let them know you're doing that before you do it.\n\nIf it's the latter though, good fucking luck. I don't know about you, but I always dreaded open-book tests/exams in college. Because they were always made difficult enough to *warrant* them being open book. They were *harder* then closed book exams. If you're vibe coding and prompt engineering your way through an interview, you can expect that interview to be written with the expectation that you're vibing through it at lightning speed, and it'd be unachievable if you didn't.",

You have layers of AI filtering before you can even get to a human. And I can assure you that the AI filters do not care about the super exciting hike I went on last weekend even if it could create that moment of good vibes with a human that you are emphasizing.\n\nThe hiring system IS adversarial. It’s turned into a sheer numbers game, a game of maximizing your odds of getting through the AI filters and still coming out vaguely believable on the other side. If I actually got a chance to speak with people regularly, I’d have a much different approach to how I apply, believe me. But I simply can’t afford to spend an hour retranslating my life experience into a bespoke application for every job listing when I know there is a very low chance anyone is even going to look at it and a lower chance I’ll beat out the other 300 people who applied for it within the first 5 minutes of it being listed.\n\nAnd while my heart goes out to all the gainfully employed hiring managers who find pressing a \nbutton to blanket filter out candidates a bit distasteful, I can assure you it feels infinitely worse on the other side where there are *actual* stakes (like can I feed my family next month).\n\nAgain, I’m not trying to trash you or anything. I really do appreciate the tips and plan to make use of them as much as possible.

I ask cause Ive been told by other SWEs to add more hard numbers which I can do, but it does feel hard knowing how to do it without feeling a little fake (capturing these metrics in production is not always clear). I don't really use AI for talking to people or in the interviewing process proper but it does feel like the job market is changing very quickly so it's hard to know what advice is still valid, especially as other people in the thread pointed out the best advice may be context dependent for where you're applying.

They hire very little, and they subsequently fire very little. They also don’t seem to throw the kitchen sink at the newest and shiniest thing. \n\nFrom a financial perspective, Apple sits on one of the largest stockpiles of cash of all companies, they are sitting on about $50 billion in cash. This usually entails that the company is slow to exhaust resources. \n\nTLDR; they are conservative with their investments (into new projects and employees) and their hiring process is very selective.",

A really successful small firm could die in a month if they were to lose two contracts back-to-back. For the huge companies, any sign of work slowing will often result in teams being let go. They're usually done silently, but in this case it's likely to be more noteworthy because layoffs and offshoring are popular right now. From a business perspective it's good, because it makes you look efficient. After all, if everyone else is doing it, it's fine, right...\n\nIt's also worth noting that in contracting firms, a LOT of people might be classed as technical/service staff when their job is essentially a PM or AM role, basically tracking work, making sure the client is happy, etc.\n\nFinally, this is my own personal perspective on contracting, but the idea that a contracting firm will have any advancements in AI is utterly laughable. It's not even a skill issue, but one where work will need to be billed to a client, and there's no fucking way that TCS is billing someone for the time taken to mess around with AI issues. Contracting firms often believe that they're at the forefront of technology, but my experience of subcontracting for TCS was arguing with a PM because I had written unit tests and they viewed it as \"unnecessary work we will not pay for\". When I pushed back, their response was \"well, it should work first time\". It's an environment of shortcuts, and while they probably love the idea of AI doing dev work, it'll end in tears without any shadow of a doubt.",

AI as a whole has gone from being research-dominated to production-dominated.\n\nFor example, in the past developing a tailored model and infrastructure for a specific NLP task required significant R&D effort. These days it's much more often about fine-tuning a foundation model and getting that model into deployment. You want someone with strong academic knowledge about AI/ML, sure, but you also want people who can make things reliable and ship products on time. If someone can do both, that's ideal.\n\nWith regards to the NLP example, the Quanta podcast recently had a good episode titled [\"When ChatGPT Broke an Entire Field\"](https://open.spotify.com/episode/22Q9bVUucdeSK3LDXicjwx?si=-Dpeunr5S6OtUTX4vr-6Kg&context=spotify%3Aplaylist%3A37i9dQZF1FgnTBfUlzkeKt) (based on [this magazine article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/when-chatgpt-broke-an-entire-field-an-oral-history-20250430/)). NLP as a field has been turned upside down by transformers, and the skills/knowledge needed to make an impact have rapidly been changing. Tasks that used to take several years to develop solutions for can now be handled in weeks.",

Two were with engineers, each technical but only pretty basic coding and mostly conversational. Then a final call with the engineering department director. It's a <100 person company, maybe 30 engineers.\n\nIt's by far the shortest / least intense interview I've gone through, and I pretty much only interview for companies around that size or smaller. Most everywhere does 4+ rounds if you're including the intro call, but more than 5 is pretty unusual, and I am including \"take home exercise\" as a round.\n\nMost typical interview loops are:\n\n* Recruiter screen\n* Hiring manager screen\n* Technical round (often a take home)\n* Deeper technical round (common if last was a take home)\n* Final call with someone important (CTO, director, etc)\n\nStep 3 is *super* common when compared to 2020-2022, but sometimes rounds 2-3-4 there are combined in some way. Occasionally there will be no final round and it goes right to offer stage after the big technical round. It's also pretty common for the deep round to just be a discussion of the take home.\n\nShortest I've ever had was screen, conversational with HM, then a technical. After that was offer phase. 3 rounds was more common in 2015-2020, I think, but I've found that losing the in-person technical round to remote interviewing has made the process longer pretty much across the board.",

If you're interviewing for a medium-sized company (100-500 employees, I don't go smaller as the pay will be much lower), you will have 2 interviews: a technical one with a one to three engineers and a behavioural on-site one with an HR and probably someone ranking between your future team lead to the head of development. \n\nThe technical interview REALLY depends on the company. I'm interviewing for C++ positions, so the company will ask you questions about the non-trivial part of the language most relevant to them (examples are virtual methods, exceptions, thread synchronization, templates, stuff like that). They will also ask you general language and data structure questions(examples: the differences between map and unordered_map and between list and vector), and they might throw a leetcode-like problem in to see whether you understand concepts like big-O notation. Some companies can also ask you a bunch of really low-level questions where you'll need to know about alignment, big-endian vs little-endian, and the C standard library.\n\nThe behavioural interview is the basic HR questions(like \"what was your biggest fuckup?\" and \"why are you switching jobs?\"). One company I worked at gave me a personality test, but it was a legit one developed by scientists for professional orientation purposes, not something like MBTI(and the company itself was really nice and chill). \n\nThe entire process takes 2-3 weeks. They can even come with the positive feedback on the day of the interview. Then they give you a couple of weeks to think about their offer. The job afterwards is usually much more chill than in our Big Techs.",

Many smaller shops are still struggling to find solid mid-level developers, especially those willing to work with \"boring\" stacks like PHP, .NET, or legacy systems. The AI hype has actually created opportunities since many devs are chasing trendy roles elsewhere.\n\nHowever, even small companies have tightened their hiring processes. While you might avoid the FAANG-style leetcode gauntlets, expect 2-3 rounds minimum and probably a small take-home project. The 200+ applicant pools are more common now, but your experience and realistic salary expectations could set you apart from fresh bootcamp grads demanding Silicon Valley wages.\n\nRegional markets vary significantly. Smaller cities and non-tech hubs often have less competition and more reasonable processes. You can use a service like Applyre to do a passive job search while you're still in your current situation. Local consulting firms, government contractors, and established businesses modernizing their systems are good targets.\n\nYour timing might actually work in your favor. Many companies are pulling back from over-hiring and focusing on steady, experienced developers who can maintain existing systems rather than rockstars building the next unicorn. The boring work is still there and still pays decent money.",

Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you want to discuss more. I am an open book!",

Straight up just do not care, and I found myself incredibly bored with the work.\n\nIt's a specialized role, but the good news is Salesforce is widely used across multiple industries. In many ways I would say it is similar to mainframe. Those industries that still run mainframes really need developers who know what they're doing on mainframe. It's just not something they teach in school, and companies are willing to pay for devs who know what they're doing. But it doesn't change the fact that it's very specialized.",

If you have more time, learn another skill that you can make a craft or \"retirement job.\" Personally, I trained weightlifting and martial arts and while it's my hobby now, I see myself maybe teaching this when I get older. I also explore digital marketing in the form of blogs, email, social media and video, so I could technically start a business or digital marketing agency or consultant if push comes to shove. Once you're comfortable, try your hand selling something based on your expetise so you have a test business. Your therapist, according to your comment responses is saying \"your feelings are valid\" and I'm reading it as since it's valid, your brain is probably detecing signs that you're going to actually become destitute. There are signs and writing on the wall that's why you're screaming internally and theres something you need to do about it. And I think you need to take it seriosuly. Be around people solving the problem. Be around people in higher positions within your career track. Be around people who are more successful and ask for their advice. Then do something. My suggestions are just examples. As I've had that thought since I entered the marketplace.",

I can get no references, everyone probably hates me and I have no other skills than being mediocre at coding.\n\nI can relate as I have the same fear. I think this is a healthy fear that one should directly address. My advice is to reduce costs and save so that you can live off of a decade from your savings if you lose your job. Work on your technical skills, interview constantly and get job offers so that you always have other options if you get laid off.\n\n> Everyone keeps harping about trades or jobs involving interacting with people and I am bad at both.\n\nI would stick to CS.\n\n> I am in terrible shape, am on the spectrum but not enough for psychologists to care about it, so I am basically someone who has no friends and no relationships in his late 30s. Should I through myself off a bridge?\n\nThis is a separate mental health issue. Get in shape. Work on getting a relationship. Talk to a therapist or read a self-help book.

I'd focus in more on specific roles using specific skillsets, then have templated, tailored resumes for those roles. Right now, your resume seems a little scattershot. As an example of what I mean, in your language skills section you have Java listed first, which tells me you'd be most comfortable in Java, but none of your projects or experience mention Java anywhere, so I don't have much to go off of regarding how skilled you actually are in Java other than current coursework from mthree, which doesn't tell me much.\n\nI was in a similar boat as a new grad, and it took me 10 months to get a job (2 months after graduating). I would have 2-3 resume's with the same or similar information, just re-ordered to fit the job description. Is the job a front-end position using React and TypeScript? You better believe I'm putting that first on the resume. If the job is enterprise Java, then Java, Spring, JUnit are all going to bubble up to the top. Normally I'd suggest having a cover letter too, but it just so happened that all my callbacks came from applications with no cover letter, so your mileage may vary. Last thing I will absolutely recommend is to **bold** the **relevant skills** in your **experience** and **personal projects**. So things like **TypeScript, Tailwind, etc.** should be bolded. HR people don't have a lot of time to sift through applications, so the easier you make it for them to find the technologies they need to see the better. Don't go too crazy with it though. If around 15% of the text in your bullet points are bolded, I'd say that's good.\n\n  \nThat's just the path I took though, there's other ways to go about this. My job hunt was from November 2024 to this month and took about 300 applications sent total , but I got the best results most recently when I was only sending 2-3 applications out per day to places I was 100% sure wanted new grads with little to no experience. I'd also like to know what your application-to-interview ratio is. For me and the people around me, it was normal to get 1 interview for every 50 applications or so. If you're not hitting that (or anywhere close to that I'm guessing) then you might be applying to places too liberally. That's all I've got! Good luck, going that long without a job is rough.\n\n  \nP.S. if your personal projects fall on the gaps in your employment, it might be worth putting the timeframes you worked on the projects. That way it would at least show you're doing something between your internship and mthree, but idk how effective that would be.",

I think here's where you can be a bit ambiguous and say you worked in a software developer capacity but not specify or limit yourself to their perception.\n\n\\- Maybe I'm just dumb but I basically don't understand what any of the projects under Key System Implementations do at first glance. Recruiters with even less technical experience and patience, might glaze over it or hit the reject button when looking for buzzwords. I'd either try to simplify the language or concepts of what you actually delivered or just tailor this section to specific types of jobs (like how in these projects you used Python etc. to deliver).\n\n\\- Probably remove the EE degree in progress as it's not really relevant or use it in your EE-only resume.\n\n\\- The undergrad teaching assistant role sounds like fluff, and no employer really cares about how many assignments you graded etc. you should probably write something along the lines of what you taught and areas of focus you excelled at teaching like red-black trees or something etc. Or try and take a look at other undergraduate TAs on Linkedin or something and see what they wrote. To me, at least it seems very \"I want a TA job.\"\n\nLast point is you probably want to tailor your resume to each of those roles you listed that you're applying for. At best this looks close to an \"EE major that used to be CS looking for an internship/jr role\" to me, but has some mixed signals so you'd want to orient the resume better towards those kinds of jobs if so.",

HR doesn't code and is the first line of filtering resumes. Hiring managers have 30 hours of meetings a week. They probably don't even read your resume before the interview.\n\nFor every 1 person who says they look at projects, there's many more who don't.

Projects are fine to teach yourself tech stacks but no need to share the code.\n\nOh 1,500 MAU app, like that's different, that's not some crap project copied off the internet or weirdly coded with AI. Is there not a website or App store listing you can link? But yeah, you're still entry level with 300-1000 applications for every job.

You need to say what languages were used in your first two projects. Most people don't know what Flutter is. Then you need to expand your Technical Skills. Don't just say Java, add Spring Boot, Postgres with JDBC, Hibernate mapping, other Spring modules, any IDEs used. If same info is within your Java project, that's fine, have it in two places so HR is more likely to read.\n\nThen consider an MS to \"reset\" your work gap and be eligible for internships again.

It drained me. \n\nIm not saying that the other job isnt worth it, im just saying just because it's eremote doesnt necessarily mean it will be similar expectations. \n\nTbh, if you like this job, Id say ask for a raise. Say you have been offered a place with a 20% raise, give your job the benefit of the doubt too (assumingyou like being there) and say that you prefer to stay but you have to do what's best for you and see if you can come to an agreement. Maybe they give you 25% more or maybe they give you 15% more. Would you stay if they didnt match the 15% but gave you around the same ballpark (10-15%?)?",

In 5th grade we had to write a report and publically present it about \"What I want to be when I grow up\". A bunch of kids picked things like professional baseball player, firefighter, cop, \"business man\", etc.\n\nI wrote my report on wanting to be a \"Computer Scientist\".\n\nI wasn't even pursing SWE specifically. I wanted to get a CS degree, and find *any* technical job that utilized my CS degree. So from day 1 I was ride-or-die CS/tech-industry.\n\nBut around 10-12 years into my career, my mind has started drifting to simpler times. When I was a teenager, I worked in fast food, and it was one of the best jobs of my life. I literally met life long friends through that job that I still keep in touch with. It's what really brought me out of my shell as an awkward teen, it was pretty formative for my life.\n\nThe pay was shit, dealing with customers is god awful, but the job itself was very \"zen\". I go in, I sling some burgs for 6-12 hours, and I go home. There's no week/month-long projects, there's no quarterly objectives, there's no product managers, there's no on call, there's nothing to think about after work. It's just burgers. The only thing that followed me after my shifts was I always smelled like beef.\n\nBut around 10 YOE? I already got my bag. I literally have enough money stashed away that I could afford to work a full time minimum wage job for the rest of my life and not sacrifice anything about my current lifestyle. So when my last job went south, and I started looking for my current one.... I kept thinking \"what if I just... went back to fast food\". I made a spreadsheet to forecast my runway.\n\nUltimately I'm glad I stuck with it and landed my current job.... but I am at the point where if I get laid off, or this job goes south, \"soft-retiring\" is a very realistic option for me.\n\nMy passion in CS and computers is still as strong as ever. But I don't need to work in the industry to enjoy that side of my life anymore.",

In hindsight it was a good option because if worse comes to worse I can pivot from SWE to EE or CE. Perhaps I would be more competitive in SWE jobs with an SWE degree, but an EE degree is still very prestigious as it was the default for programmers up until the late 90s or perhaps even early 2000s. For example the CEO of Microsoft has an EE bachelors. The CEO of Google did his Bachelors in Metallurgy and Masters and Materials Engineering.\n\nI would definitely do something engineering though. CS is less challenging (4 courses vs 6 in engineering), more saturated and offers less flexibility. And even if AI does automate most human labor, licensed Engineers still have state granted authority to sign off on safety critical projects (this matters more in an age with powerful AI, because powerful means dangerous). The reason engineers are sometimes grouped with doctors, lawyers etc. is because they all need to go through stringent licensing and all have serious legal considerations when they sign off on something. Getting a degree that enables you a path to such a license would be extremely valuable, and CS won't give you that option.",

But my advice as someone with a few career regrets would be this:\n\n1) Only go to college if you feel ready to give school your full attention. It is relatively easy to fuck around for 4 years and walk out with a degree. But if you limp your way through a STEM degree without fully internalizing the content and setting aside time for relevant clubs and student associations, you're not getting much more than debt out of school.\n\nThere are plenty of things you can do in the mean-time if you want to focus on being young for a little while.\n\n2) Only go into a major you actually have some passion for. Engineering is a lifelong grind. You need to always be learning new things, taking classes, and skilling up. A lot of people in software burn out or decay because it's too draining to grind something you hate.\n\n3) The most important thing your college gives you access to is not the degree. It is professional work experience through internships and co-ops. Your entire college career should be centered around securing as much work experience as possible as early as possible. A college degree without at least 9 months of work experience is borderline worthless.",

Your willingness to walk away from the offer\n\nIf you don't have another offer but you have rich parents who will bankroll you until you get a better offer? You have leverage.\n\nIf you have another offer, you have leverage.\n\nIf you don't have another offer but don't care about having to crash on a friend's couch and sell feet pics for money, you have leverage.\n\nIf you don't have another offer and you really want this job and you're not willing to risk losing it, then you don't have leverage.\n\nWith that in mind, and in this market, you need to be really careful as to how you legitimately negotiate, but you don't have to be that careful in how you position yourself to get the best offer possible.\n\nThings you want to do:\n\n1. Try not to give a number first. If they ask you for a number, ask what their range is. If they don't want to tell you and refuse to keep going without a number, you might have to give it to them - but even then, you can say \"I'm looking for $X, but I'm flexible depending on what the job, team and benefits look like\". Because that gives you the ability to come back later and say you need more.\n\n2. Tell them you're at different stages of interviewing with different companies, but this is the opportunity you're most excited about. Because here's what you're trying to balance - you want to make them feel like they have competition, but you don't want to make them feel like you're going to waste their time. Also - if they ask for what companies you're talking to and what stage of conversations you're in, you can straight up lie - and you should. However, you want to make sure that it doesn't sound like you're too far along with anyone else (again, don't want to waste time). But if you're talking about e.g., an on-site interview, feel free to tell them you have an onsite scheduled with Google for the week after. Not only are they not going to doubt you, but also they have no way of confirming or debunking that claim.",

Honestly, take it with a grain of salt. Most of the loudest voices predicting the \"end of software engineering\" aren’t engineers themselves and are often coming from a business lens where disruption = fear. But if you’re in engineering, you can already see what’s really happening. AI is changing the way engineers work, not eliminating the need for them. Sure, some lower-level tasks are getting automated, but that just means the bar is shifting toward people who understand AI systems, prompt engineering, model integration, performance tuning, security, ethics, etc. You’re positioning yourself exactly in that space.\n\nAlso, the fact that your new role is in AI software engineering? That’s one of the most resilient and high-impact areas to be in right now. There’s still a massive shortage of engineers who can build, scale, and fine-tune AI products responsibly.",

Work on those, ask quesitons, etc but at the same time: \n\n  \n\\- Learn the version control system / branching strategy / release schedule / rollback policies etc better than anyone else in the organization. You'll find that most people are fuzzy on large parts of it and you'll be able to solve and prevent many problems simply by not being fuzzy.\n\n\\- Find out where all the documentation is and start reading it. It will be of varying quality and often out of date but get comfortable with the org's business, architecture, network infrastructure, personnel structure, etc.\n\n\\- Talk to as many people as you can, in all roles and departments. Learn what they do. You will eventually save someone from a million dollar mistake because you will have awareness of things that no one else does. Make people like you and see you as useful. You will get many more opportunities that way.\n\n\\- Learn your tools and technology stack deeply. In the AI era it's more important than ever. It just takes a few books. Learn everything about Java, be able to talk about the major features that were added at various milestones and why you would use them. Same with Spring or whatever else you're using.",

I find this useful for taking a first pass on tasks which I then tidy up manually / in cursor.\n\nIf you work on UX working with Vervel, bolt, or magic patterns can be useful for vibe coding prototypes to spin things up.\n\nIf you want to get fancy you can try running a model locally or using open source alternatives (eg Qwen) to get some of these capabilities without having to pay - with the assumption you have a place to run the model.\n\nSecond what others have said. If you want it learn something you have to do it yourself. Offloading to AI does *not* help you learn though it may enable you to do things you couldn’t otherwise do. Eg we have PMs at my company who are able to prototype their own solutions and even moon light as devs on simple tickets when short staffed. They aren’t learning how to dev.

The biggest mistake would be positioning yourself as a career changer when you're actually a seasoned developer expanding your skill set. Your deep understanding of how applications work from the client side gives you a massive advantage in backend development because you understand the full picture of how data flows and what the frontend actually needs. Companies should see you as someone who can build APIs that actually make sense for the consuming applications, not just someone learning Java from scratch.\n\nThe interview struggle you're facing is real and frustrating, but there are ways around the traditional leetcode gauntlet. Target smaller companies and startups where you can often get in front of actual engineering managers who care more about your ability to solve real problems than your ability to reverse a binary tree under pressure. Focus on companies that do practical coding exercises or take-home projects instead of whiteboard sessions. Your strength in systems design and high-level thinking is incredibly valuable, especially for backend roles where understanding architecture matters more than memorizing algorithms. Some companies do hire based on these skills alone, particularly in more senior positions where they expect you to learn the specific technical details on the job.\n\nI actually work on [AI interview helper](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to showcase your transferable skills and handle technical questions that might be outside your current wheelhouse.",

If you didn’t get the solution you failed the interview.\n\nI dont think it's as binary as you think. For me when I've taken coding interviews, i've gotten jobs at major companies when I dont even get the question entierely right. If im in the ball park and my explanation as to why I got there is correct, i've impressed the interviewer. There's def been times I didnt get the answer but I also realized my mistake or didnt and said \"my next idea would be to do XYZ since this didnt work\". \n\nFor me all 3 are just as important but the more Jr you are the more the coding interview should matter. The more Senior you are the more leadership and system design should matter. Because as a Jr it's important to know how to code and learn system design within the company, as a principal it's more important to know design/leadership over code. Seniors and mid-level need to know more about leadership/system design than Jrs but less than principals. \n\nSo for percentages id say:\n\nJrs - 80% coding, 15% System, 5% leader\n\nMid-level - 65% coding 25% system, 10% leader\n\nSenior - 40% coding 30% system, 30% leader\n\nPrincipal - 20% coding, 40% system, 40% leader\n\nThe higher you go in this career the less you code so for a principal coding shouldnt be important because at that point it's assumed you already know.",

For example, they might think of a straightforward brute force approach and we start with that, then I indicate towards a way they might be able to make it more efficient and see if they catch on and can take the hint and follow it to a better solution.\n\nIt's also to account for people have one or two 'bad questions', like basically having a mental blank on one.

Good developers ask questions, especially early in their careers. A healthy team would encourage this, not punish it. The \"vibes-based\" performance reviews are particularly concerning red flags.\n\nDon't let one dysfunctional workplace convince you to abandon an entire career. Most tech teams aren't like this, and your methodical approach suggests you actually have good instincts for the field. Your current situation is damaging your confidence unnecessarily, and the longer you stay, the harder it becomes to remember that this isn't normal or acceptable.\n\nStart job searching immediately while you still have income. A service like Applyre might be helpful. When interviewing, ask about mentorship programs, team dynamics, and how they support junior developers.

If I need to take a kid to the drs or there’s something in the evening it’s never been an issue, but that might mean I’m putting in a few hours after bed time\n\nLast thing I would add is you definitely need to be honest with yourself, if you’re confident you can prioritize/push back to protect your personal life you’ll be fine. But if you can’t this place will consume as much time from you as it can get",

It does help to make your resume look a bit nicer and might get you a slightly higher role and pay off the bat, but to me it's not worth 2 years of missing out on experience to do for an extra 5k-10k in pay you would've just likely had if you started to work. The key really is if you can get a job to pay for your masters degree. So in summary, it's not worth the MSCS unless you get someone to pay it for you or if you can escape paying minimal and not having to get loans. I had my job pay it for me and I grinded for 2 years as a part-time student and only had to pay 5k out of pocket those 2 years. But I also did summer courses as well to finish on time. \n\nAs for your leetcode grind. I am not someone who really thinks you need to \"grind\" leetcode to get a job. You can and might be good at it to land the job, the problem is that many people think they can just grind it and dont care to learn the ins and outs of what they are doing. So they basically are hoping to get a similar question where they can think \"omg that's leetcode question #100 or similar to it, i just need a map\". But they dont care to learn why they need the map, or if there's a slightly different approach they could take. I have been in the job market twice in my career, never had to grind leetcode and I got into two big tech companies (one of them a Mag7 company) by just following a google DSA guide I will link below. It has videos from cracking the coding interview author that explain DSA very well. Also links free leetcode study guides with example questions to practice on. \n\nCompanies dont care if you get the questions right, they only care if you know what you are doing and explain your thought process well in the questions. I got both those jobs and didnt do 100% well on the questions. A few times I got stuck but because I explained my thought process well they liked my approach. They know you wont get it 100% off the bat, they just want to know where your heads at. So for me i like to say \"hey i think I can possibly use a map here because of XYZ possibly a set\" and then I try it. I also go step by step. So usually the first thing I tackle is the return cases. I.e. if I am doing a array traversal the first thing I write is the return case if array is empty. It sounds dumb, but they appreciate when you tackle the small things first that could easily be forgotten. Also it's one of those things of once you start coding your nerves go down even if it's a simple lin. \n\nThen at the end I write test cases and try to go through multiple different cases (empty array, edge cases, etc). If any of them come out wrong, then I quickly refactor.\n\nGoogle DSA link is: [https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)",

Choose 1–2 roles you’d genuinely like, and let them drive your prep direction. Focus on high-yield patterns (like sliding window, recursion, trees) rather than solving random 300 problems. Your goal isn’t to become a LeetCode machine it’s to show structured thinking under time pressure. You already solve harder things at work. Just reframe this as “translating” your strength into interview language.",

It's very much a class based masters and the majority of students don't do any research. If your goal is to find advisors, ones who can write the type of letters that get you into grad school, you can certainly  do that. I'd ask on r/OMSCS for stories, but I know it's possible.\n\nI was also interested in Type Theory (Haskell programmer at the time) and unfortunately I didn't find any faculty working on that. I wasn't going back to grad school (did that once), though, and my main focus for doing the program was to get a better grip on CS fundamentals and help grow my industry career. For that, it was extremely effective and I got into big tech pretty soon after graduating.  \n  \nI did find this: [https://omscs.gatech.edu/research-opportunities](https://omscs.gatech.edu/research-opportunities)   I'd check that out. All that said, the way I got into a PhD program was by working for a professor as a lab tech, doing good work, and getting into the program hosted by the school. To get into a PhD program, grades and papers help, but what it really comes down to is one professor with influence speaking on your behalf. If you push, that should be possible with OMSCS.",

I have a biology undergrad, was working as a Haskell programmer at a small start up, and 2 years after graduating I made it to a big tech company with pretty good pay.

I dont mind being called out but it seems like he's going out of his way just to do it to me is there anything you can suggest that I can do to best approach this. I dont mind talking to him but I felt it may be best to bring it up to you so to avoid the wrong approach.\" Something like that.\n\nUnfortunately in this career there are always hostile devs. Some you can learn to co-exist with them, others it's impossible. I've worked with 2 guys like that. First guy, was a screamer. His way or the high-way. I was terrified of hij when I first go tthere. Then I had to work with him. Funny thing was, he ended up being the nicest guy. I learned how to work with him basically. I noticed that if I had a difference of opinion I had to back up my words. Most of the time I was still wrong lol, but sometimes I was right and he gave me credit. I think he liked that I did my own investiagation and even had my own points. I wasnt just taking his word as the god given truth. \n\nNow in my second job, I could never figure out the hostile dev. He had no people skills that I could crack. In a lot of ways I compare him to Michael Jordan. He was the guy that knew everything of the project. He produced in his sleep. He didnt mind working 12 hour days. He told managers how to do their job. I fhe didnt like your work ethic, he didnt want to work with you. And I think he realzied early on he didnt like my work ethic (Im more of a9-5 guy). I worked with him on a major project he had created and it went terribly. I kept finding erors and had to change my design like 20 times because each time I came up with a design, another problem would come up. Then he gave my manager a list of his complaints of me. My manager kind of walked on eggshells for him tbh. I will admit some was fair, but others just seemed unfair. The biggest one I remember that I felt was unfair was that my manager said that I have too many commits in my MRs. That happened once and it was because the design changed so much. I fought it but my manager even 6 months later was still using that against me. I ended up getting fired. I dont blame that dev but it defintelty felt like the beginning of the end when I wasnt on his good side.",

Sometimes they are completely clueless people that don’t understand that using a wide audience chat is not how you deal with things.\n\nSo, we’ve fixed this a few ways. \n\nFirst step is to document every single time they call you out on a wide audience chat of any kind. If this person does this to others, probably should document that as well. The more records you have the better. Screenshots are also preferred.\n\nSecond step is to let your manager know that you don’t appreciate being put on blast by this other dev in a company wide chat especially when they you’re not at fault for the issue. Include your record of every time they  call you out specifically and what the actual issue was that had to be resolved. Ask your manager how this should be handled. The wrong answer is “nothing”. We had to do a meeting where all the devs agreed to not individually name people even in our team only chat for issues. Senior Devs can ping people directly and handle it not in a chat.\n\nThird step is if this behavior continues and your management doesn’t do anything, notify HR with your documentation. Make sure you have save this documentation somewhere you have access to in case they retaliate (manager, HR, senior dev).\n\nOn most of my teams, we never had to get past step 2. Only once did we have someone get to step 3 and HR talked to the offending dev and manager. Behavior stopped for a few months and then started up again. In that case, the guy was gone in like 48 hours after he started again because he started blaming people who weren’t on our team or didn’t work on the project with issues.",

If you hear about someone working on cloud migrations, network configurations, or server maintenance, ask if you can shadow, help, or at least learn what tools they’re using. You’d be surprised how much access and insight you can get just by showing curiosity and initiative. Outside of work, keep building your skills around cloud fundamentals. Since you're studying cloud computing, start applying what you're learning in small personal projects. Spin up a website using S3 and CloudFront, automate infrastructure with Terraform, or play around with IAM policies in a sandbox AWS or Azure environment. The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner or Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) are great early on. You don’t need them to get a job, but they can show recruiters you're serious. Then, stack on more practical, intermediate certs (like AWS Solutions Architect Associate or AZ-104) when you feel ready. Definitely apply to internships as much as possible, but also start building a presence online. Maybe a GitHub with your cloud projects, or even posts on LinkedIn showing what you’re learning. Follow your interests too but with intention. If you're curious about DevOps, play with CI/CD pipelines. If security piques your interest, try setting up least privilege access or configuring network firewalls in the cloud. Over time, your interests will naturally start guiding you toward the kind of engineering roles you’d enjoy most.",

You’re not burnt out you’re underutilized.

        "body": "You need to learn how to code on a team, and usually the best place to do that is product teams that are PM driven and essentially feature factories. I'm not sure what infra you are working on, but when I took an infra job, I ultimately left because I was frustrated with the shit code we wrote and the lack of any sort of real development work. I did all sorts of stuff with cloudflare tunnels, DNS migrations, and dealt with TLS certs, plus on call. The work I really wanted to do, on the database engine, was just not a priority for us, compared to cloud operations.\n\nI've seen juniors and new grads do well on infra teams, so it's definitely possible, but all things career progression depend on how much you excel in your roll, and the opportunities your org has to promote you. I'd say that's equally true as a junior engineer trying to make senior in 5 years, as it is for a senior trying to make staff and looking for projects with company wide impact, at least under the system of stack ranking that will average on the organization level.\n\nI basically left infra to go back to product, and am trying to make staff now as a team lead. There's no shortage of impactful projects, especially if you can step up and be a leader. I am hesitant to think one domain mints more staff engineers than another, and I'm staring down a company wide rollout of our project for next year, so that hasn't been the case with me.\n\nIn my experience, the biggest factor is just what you want to do. I tried infra, didn't like it, so went back to product. If you like infra, do it, the amount of work is pretty much insane, and when you don't like it, you'll really struggle to outcompete the equally smart people who do. Most of the job is simply showing up everyday, moving the ball, and stepping up when you need to. If you're looking for opportunities, there's no shortage of that in either domain.",

It is ideal if you end up on a platform team that builds products for other engineers, but product engineering can work out poorly for infrastructure in terms of designing systems and making plans that account for reliability, scalability, and anticipating technical debt. Product engineering relies heavily on quick iteration, optics, and easily marketable impact which can be hard to do with infrastructure and legacy systems. You can have a harder time getting promoted and may need to spend more time on painful parts of the job instead of pure coding experience. ",

        "body": "I landed on an infra/platform team as a new grad at a f500 household name fintech. I was misled and thought I'd be doing mobile, it was a miscommunication during the team matching process. I've been on the team for 3 years. To be honest, it has been pretty miserable, and I actually think it has hindered my career.\n\nMy team is very top heavy, its all senior and staff engineers. We maintain the service mesh, the problems are all pretty abstract and challenging and require a serious knowledge of the *entire* system, and every item we own is a tier0 critical service meaning zero room for failure. It requires both breadth and depth of knowledge. So finding junior-appropriate tasks was really difficult for the first couple of years. Most of our time is spent putting out fires and handling incidents, and dealing with horizontal asks. The work is hard and the on-call toil is extremely stressful, the work life balance is bad, and the work is simply not fun. It is more of a devops/sre role than SWE, and I am not actually building or creating anything, the work is not fulfilling. I expressed some concern to management that I was not writing enough code and was missing out on vital early-career experiences to hone the basics, but everybody always changed the conversation to tell me how lucky I was to have the opportunity to learn system design and get exposure to kubernetes (sound familiar, OP?). Unsurprisingly, when I finally decided I wanted to switch teams, I was told that I couldn't because I don't have enough experience writing code and other managers want to see evidence that I have worked on substantial projects with object oriented languages. So at my company, I am basically stuck. I worry that if I look for a job elsewhere using another stack, they will think I don't have the skills they are looking for (or that I will land the job anyway and then struggle to ramp up). I do not want to work in similar roles in the future. Going from devops back to SWE is hard - so choose carefully.\n\nI think that infra/devops is something that people tend to do when they get tired of app development and are seeking more complex challenges. Some people really just enjoy this type of work, as well, but my experience is they tend to embody the negative stereotype of misanthropic back-end developers, more-so than regular SWEs. That is anecdotal, admittedly. I also think that having a background in regular SWE work will help somebody do better with devops once they eventually get there - it is hard to maintain a platform for service owners to develop microservices on top of, when I have never really done it myself. \n\nI do not believe in the idea of \"take on something extremely challenging as a beginner, and rise to the occasion\". Science has shown that this is not the most ideal pedagogical approach. It is like weight lifting: give me a 300lb weight, and no matter how long you let me try, I won't ever get strong enough to lift it. Give me multiple plates and let me progressively try heavier ones, and I will eventually get to the heavier ones.\n\nThis is just my experience. I struggled to find mentorship and that is a big part of it. The team is constantly busy with high-severity urgent incidents, nobody wants to make time to answer questions and help me. It's been a really shitty experience and I burned out very quickly.\n\ntldr: I advise against it, but in this labor market, it may be wise take what you can get.",

This makes sure everybody is on the same page and people like the team lead can interject if they think something doesn't pass the sniff test.\n\n>It wouldn't be such an issue if I found out earlier in the sprint, but with him, it's usually like 1-3 days before the sprint ends and this is a noticeable pattern with him. It drags me down in completing the original task that was assigned to me and the story has chance to rollover and nobody wants that.\n\nNobody should really care if a story rolls over.  Sprints are there to collect data for velocity not some hard deadline.  If you are constantly rolling over stories the solution is for the team to agree to less points in a sprint.\n\nIf anything this pattern should show that you need to agree to less points because you know the Senior Dev is going to drop the hammer late in the sprint.\n\n> I just want to meet the original expectation of my story before going further and doing more work. The changes he talks about make sense, I just think they can be added in a productive stable manner.\n\nIf the make sense then talk about adding new stories for these unexpected changes.  Those stories can be added to the next sprint in exchange for other work if they are important enough.\n\nYou should be talking about this like this with your boss in 1-on-1s.  You don't have to call out the Senior Dev directly, but ask your boss how they want you to handle situations like that.  The answer they give you show you how they want things to run and you can make better decisions going forwards.",

Sometimes the skill is also in realizing that they've asked the wrong question and proposing an alternate question with a more useful answer.\n\nUnless you've very recently answered the same question for someone else, or the question is related to the work you were doing moments before the conversation began, being able to give a deep, accurate, off the cuff answer is not expected. Give the best answer you can in the moment, be clear that it's a preliminary answer, tell the person you'll get back to them with a more complete answer soon, and then follow through on that promise as quickly as possible, e.g. via email or chat. (In my position, the real challenge is having time to follow up on question A before I get questions B, C, and D coming in...)\n\nThe other senior engineers you see answering questions off the cuff are either answering about their current work, or giving a rehearsed answer to a common question, or (worst case) bluffing about how complete/correct their answer is. You might occasionally encounter someone with a near photographic memory for technical things, but it's not the norm. I don't expect it from my team, and I don't feel like others expect it from me.",

So I think the answer that I would have here is to think about what you're doing to set yourself apart from others and how you're showcasing this to potential employers.\n\nOther than that, I'd say that software engineering jobs seem harder to come by than usual, even for those with experience, and the first job people find after college in their career field is typically the most difficult job search they have, so finding a job will probably take a while. TBH 100+ job applications really isn't that much and I kind of think you have unrealistic expectations on how long and how much work goes into finding a job as a new grad.\n\n  \nAlso, in addition to the resume advice others are giving you above that you should listen to, your resume also seems to be missing a skills section which generally should be included for a software engineering or other technical role.",

Leadership experience in extracurriculars looks just as good, maybe better.\n\nYou have internships right, you should be getting callbacks. I looked up the university given the non-4.0 grading scale, TCS in India had [big layoffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mb7cxe/offshore_services_giant_tcs_is_laying_off_12000/) and that's not a good sign for the industry as a whole. Still, you should at least make it past the initial screening\n\nOne of those companies should have wanted to hire you or offer a second term to come back. It's not a big stretch to think you were just resume boosting and didn't really want to work for them. Better to have 3 internships than 0 by far but you really only needed one. I'm not saying take 1 or 2 off your resumes, just that 3 isn't all upside.",

When you work for a company like that, you're basically signing up for onboarding yourself in 6 months, and committed to staying out of the bottom 5-10% of the team.\n\nAt larger companies, there's opportunity to really go beyond your role, the performance review process is standardized, and when you submit a a promo packet, you'll get a response. I don't think it's that bad, but I also stepped up as a Senior to be in a team lead role, so that's a sort built in \"exceeds expectations\" as long as we deliver impact every perf period. It's fine to be motivated by money, I check stock price all the time, but the challenging nature of the work means folks that are passionate really hold an advantage.\n\nAs far as concern over getting PIP'd. I've found that the people on the PIP shortlist are the same ones that are more motivated by money than actually becoming better software engineers. In a workplace like a large company with stack ranking, you're not only competing against smart people, but smart people who are highly motivated and ambitious to move ahead.",
