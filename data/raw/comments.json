The new tools built in rust, and with interoperability in mind via open formats - both storage with parquet+deltalake/iceberg and in memory with arrow - that work natively in-process with python bindings and even out-of-process, are going to be much easier to work.\n\nI've been plugging away at using daft, which can run in-process with python, or out of process on a single machine, or across a ray cluster. You can take the same code and run it in something super lightweight and then scale it out to a huge cluster. No need to change processing engines.\n\nI can see more being built around duckdb for the same purpose.\n\nI've seen someone benchmark running daft distributed within a databricks cluster and it being *faster*. That is you start up a Databricks cluster, install daft and ray, and you get better performance than the spark instances you're running alongside. At that point Databricks is just a glorified cluster manager and notebook provider.\n\nSpark is just too cumbersome and too awkard to deal with. It isn't suitable for small use-cases, and in very large ones it can be arcane to figure out what is going on. People just can't develop skills with it until they are working at a huge scale, so they get chucked in the deep end with issues.\n\nThese new tools will let people get experience on their own machine, it will let DS and DA roles grapple with things directly, and let everyone get essentially the same experience when they work at scale.",

Thanks for the shoutout, really heartening to see so much of the community resonating with the same frustrations that we had when we first started the project…\n\nHere are some key guiding principles which I hold dear to the data software that we want to build for the future:\n\n1. Python-first, with native wheels that don’t require external dependencies\n\n2. Works on ANY scale — effective both for a 60MB CSV as well as 100TB of Parquet/Iceberg. This means having best-in-class local as well as distributed engines\n\n3. Works on ANY modality — data today is more than just JOINs and GROUPBYs. The reality is that data is messy and unstructured!! Sometimes my UDF fails but I don’t want it to kill my entire job…\n\nWe’re trying to be more public with our roadmap and stuff too so please let us know if there is interest. For instance, we will be working to reduce reliance on Ray as a hard dependency soon and enable raw Kubernetes deployments (which seems to be a common ask), and we have a Dashboard in the works (we call this Spark UI++). \n\nAppreciate the support here ❤️keep plumbing away r/dataengineering the daft team will be here to make things with less oom and more zoom.",

It's genuinely good to see someone mapping out what they've learned with this much clarity, especially the enthusiasm for the core DE work – debugging, building, improving infrastructure. You've definitely hit on some crucial points that many take years to internalize.\n\nThings like focusing on pipeline resilience, code quality, and the importance of documentation are spot on. That’s the stuff that separates okay pipelines from robust, maintainable systems. The emphasis on CI/CD, templates, and understanding SQL fundamentals alongside frameworks like Spark/Pandas shows you're building a really well-rounded technical base. Keep that momentum going – the learning curve is steep, but you're clearly navigating it well.\n\nJust a couple of thoughts to add from experience:\n\n- You're right that physical presence can boost visibility and make ad-hoc collaboration easier, especially in certain environments or client-facing roles. However, it's worth developing the skills to achieve similar communication effectiveness and relationship building remotely. Mastering clear documentation (which you already value!), proactive updates, and strong asynchronous communication is vital, as many teams are distributed or hybrid. The core skill is effective collaboration, whatever the medium - so don't view remote work as inherently having fewer opportunities; it just requires different strengths.\n\n- Regarding DRY and OOP, I have no doubt they are good principles. Just remember the other side: sometimes abstracting too early or creating overly complex OOP structures can hurt readability more than duplicated code, especially for simpler tasks. Finding that balance between avoiding repetition and maintaining simplicity/clarity comes with practice. You're right to question when not to use OOP though!\n\n- You've got the right idea with watermarks and parameterization for the pipeline self-healing process. Also think about idempotency – ensuring your tasks can run multiple times with the same input and produce the same outcome. It’s key for reliable reruns and recovery. And as you mature your pipelines, layer in dedicated data quality testing on top of unit/integration tests.\n\n- Definitely keep that volunteering spirit intact to improve things. Just learn to balance it strategically cuz it's easy to get pulled into fixing everything legacy, so make sure those efforts align with broader team goals and don't consistently derail your primary project responsibilities.\n\n- This is more of a personal ick, but I generally don't emphasize too much on documenting the finer details of a codebase, since things change and us devs can spend more time documenting things instead of focusing on what matters to our stakeholders.\n\nOverall, your reflections show a great attitude and a solid understanding of what makes a good DE. You're focusing on the right areas – technical depth, process improvement, and collaboration. Keep learning, stay curious, and continue refining that craft. You're well on your way :)",

Honestly, DE is so backend, I would generally rather business users not come to me directly. \nAnd my experience with pre commit and linter has largely been negative. \n\nDocumention is always extremely valuable. Consistent naming conventions and packages is critical. Our consultants did neither and it is a shit show. \n\nOOP can be helpful in some regards, but I'm with you that FP is more than sufficient for the bulk of jobs. OOP overcomplicates, makes debugging more difficult and time consuming, and is rather rigid. It's worth it if it is scalable, but if it takes the same level of effort to cram all the SQL and configs into an OOP approach as just coding it from scratch in FP, you might as well use FP. \n\nI'm coming up on my 1 year as well. My biggest lessons have been think in terms of frameworks (how can you organize your code, how can you automate or parameterize development, etc.), that you simply can't learn everything and delegation is critical, knowledge of the business data is extremely important, that InfoSec is a PITA, and think through things before implementing anything (nothing is ever as simple as it first seems).",

I did ask them where this data would eventually live. They told me assume it was a database then I asked about a dashboard where I mentioned where the schema normalization would be important to make sure that on the front end you could identify specific filters to show the user (like drop downs). \n\nAlso, your point about aligning with their existing tech stack is spot on. I think I got a little too caught up in the idea of feeding everything into an LLM pipeline with vectorization + embeddings. Probably came off like I was optimizing for a use case they didn’t even confirm.\n\nIn hindsight, I should’ve slowed down and clarified whether they needed real-time ingestion, what the downstream usage was (e.g., dashboarding vs search vs ML), and whether historical backfill was in scope. I was so nervous lol 😅. Thank you for your answer",

For example, all source databases should dictate anything that contains currencies and prices in float(8,2). That way, you don't feel frustrated that two columns that are topically similar (e.g. transaction fees or sales subtotal) can be calculated without some weird-ass errors due to data type mismatch.\n\nThat's just **one** type of governance. There's also naming convention governance, (so you don't have one table column named \"STR_NAME\" and another named \"NAME_TXT\"). I could think of other things, but remember that you want everyone to talk to each other compatibly. The less you need to wrangle and data cleanse, the faster it is to deliver OLAPs or BI reports.",

That said, it’s not flashy, and it’s rarely a direct path to monetization unless you’re working in a highly regulated industry. In most cases its something I think you layer on top of your existing data skills to increase your value in the market, whether you're a data engineer, analyst, team lead, or CDO. But generally once you step into a management role, governance quickly becomes central. At that level, almost every decision touches on it in some way. And I definitely see its importance growing on a broader scale, albeit from a different than traditional point of view that there are generally much more CDO's and data leaders out there who require and need those skills or that organizations are failing in mode modern projects like AI or digital twins and learn the hard way the requirement of governance.  So I guess overall its just more streamlined and integrated into broader management, data transformation, and change management efforts.\n\nTo answer your question directly. Is data governance essential to land a job? I don't think so, unless you're lucky or in a specific industry. But can it significantly increase your value in a data related career? Absolutely, especially if you're entering the management area.",

You can define columns without reference to dataframes, so you can make a list of column expressions *before* you work with the dataframes.\n\nedit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Your slice [] of the map column based on a key means spark is creating a column expressions mapping every key:value in mapping, then throwing it all away to pick a single key from the map.~~\n\nAll of this requires communication between spark and pyspark, which takes time. When you do it 600 times it takes a while.\n\nEvery time you chain dataframe defining functions pyspark calls out to spark to build a plan. Time spent on the plan increases exponentially as you have more steps as each step takes longer as it builds on the last. 600 dataframe definitions is a lot.\n\nDo the `json.loads` once for each mapping, not for each variable for each model. \n\nedit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Don't create a full map column just to select one key out of it, just get the value from the original mappings dict. Don't chain withColumn, generate all the column definitions into a list then do `df.select(\"*\",*listofcols)`~~ \n\nedit: fixing 2am mistakes...\n\nEven though the key you pull from the map is the value in column 'v', you are parsing and defining the same map dtype column multiple times -- 150 times if it is the 10 models and 15 variables looping over the same 4 mappings. Think of the size and complexity of this query as it gets built out, where spark is generating 600 chained 'views' with hundreds of mapping objects, and every mapping gets used so cannot be discarded before processing.\n\nIn pandas you don't have this because the mapping object is available in the same process directly and doesn't need to be duplicated data per row. It also processes the dataframe in full at each step, so it can discard any previously used map as it goes. Whereas spark can't access your dict directly and has lazy evaluation, so it has to 'remember' every single generation of every map field all at once when it finally runs, and will be duplicating the data into each row in its behind-the-scenes rdd.\n\nYou want to only parse each model once, and only generate its map once, and reuse that. You also want to make a list of your output columns then use `.select()` on them all at once. To make the reuse explicit you can split it into two selects.\n\n    df = some_input\n    m = model\n\n    original_colnames [c for c in df.columns]\n    # parse the mappings once\n    mapping_dicts = [json.loads(mp) for mp in mappings)\n    # generate the mapping cols once\n    mapping_cols = [\n      F.create_map([F.lit(k_or_v) for kv in mapping_dict.items()]).alias(f\"map_{i}\")\n      for i,mapping_dict in enumerate(mapping_dicts)\n    ]\n    # define all variable redirections through the map all together\n    mapped_cols = [\n        F.col(\"map_{i}\")[F.col(f\"some_var_{v}\")].alias(f\"new_{m}\") # something seems off here\n        for v in variables\n        for i in range(len(mapping_cols))\n    ]\n    # generate new dataframe\n    new_df = (\n      # define a dataframe with the mappings in a first step\n      # (so you can easily view this df if you cut the code up)\n      df.select(\n        *original_colnames,\n        *mapping_cols\n      )\n      # use the defined maps to generate the output columns\n      .select(\n        *original_colnames,\n        *mapped_cols\n      )\n    )\n\n    return df\n\nNote that you don't *have* to do this in two selects if you reuse the actual column objects, but then you can't as easily check the intermediate state with just the mappings available.",

A lot of experienced data engineers hit this wall after working with legacy tools, especially when the market shifts fast. Most would also wish they had the experience.

Courses are fine, but real traction comes when you can point to something you’ve created. Set up a public GitHub repo with two or three small but complete projects. Think end-to-end: pull in data, transform it with PySpark or dbt, orchestrate it with Airflow, push it into a warehouse like BigQuery or Snowflake. Even if it’s basic, the fact that it works is what hiring managers want to see. Aka you are self sufficient and not to be watched but deliver results.\n\nAt the same time, tighten how you talk about yourself. You’re not “catching up”—you’re evolving. Build a 60-second intro that shows you’ve worked in high-scale environments and now you’ve added modern tools to your stack. The story needs to be clear and confident.\n\nAlso—don’t get stuck applying to roles blindly. Be intentional. Focus on companies in transition—those moving from legacy to cloud. Your past is an asset, not a liability. It’s not about having every shiny skill. It’s about showing you can adapt and ship. Do that, and doors will open. Keep going. Good luck 🍀 keep us posted.",

Add as much or as little documentation as you wish. You can reuse common snippets of code (macros) among the scripts, which is helpful for making the code modular. The whole thing is code so it harmonizes nicely with git and version control. Finally, the little SQL scripts are easily referenceable by orchestrators to be used as building blocks in other programs.\n\nDuckdb is used to create versatile lightweight ephemeral database instances that can hold a lot of data in memory and can run blazing fast queries and joins in SQL. If you need to temporarily store data then duckdb is a nice way to ingest, transform, and stage data on its way to some more permanent system. Well, you can even use duckdb as the final resting place for some data since it is after all a portable embedded database like SQLite. Duckdb can fit just about anywhere in a data pipeline, but it’s especially useful for memory-intensive or slow tasks that are bottlenecking your workflow.\n\nHonestly the tools have a ton of overlap and you could very well use both, like [this guy](https://georgheiler.com/post/dbt-duckdb-production/).",

But it’s not very “production-ready.”\n\nMaybe you’d end up using an orchestrator like Airflow. If you have many transforms that need to be run in order, you’ll be writing a lot of custom logic to build the DAG, handle retries of something fails, etc.\n\ndbt abstracts some of that away. It’s basically a convenience that lets you write transforms and automatically builds the DAG for you in the right order. \n\nYou could use dbt to manage transforms in DuckDB just as easily as in a warehouse. The main problem with doing the transform in DuckDB and then loading to a warehouse is you have to build some process to do the loading. Are you just going to drop and rebuild every table? It’s not a deal breaker, just extra complexity you’ll have to manage.",

There is no debate on this.

One way to get around this is writing a dbt macro that runs your sql per batch and union the results. \nSo all in all it works great but dbt-duckdb doesn’t give you the all the same bells and whistles as dbt-Postgress would.

There's a quote about writing in general - \"Perfection is achieved, not when there is *nothing* more to add, but when there is *nothing left to take away*\". Giving someone 6 page CV isn't going to make them think \"this person is seriously experienced\" it's going to make them roll their eyes a bit. That shouldn't discount that candidate (I definitely wouldn't throw a 6-page CV in the bin, for example), but it definitely doesn't help.\n2. making \"hail mary\" applications as an entry-level dev for a position that is advertised as a senior position may *feel* productive but is kind of a waste of your time and the recruiter's time. There may be exceptions - maybe they were planning on also hiring someone junior and may contact you about that position - but that's kind of rare.\n\nSimilarly for the \"there's no such thing as entry level in data engineering\" - that's someone trying to appear profound, but instead is frankly coming across as an unhelpful dick.\n\nIf you're lacking experience try for internships, give Google's [Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) a shot, try to do some self-study and personal projects or find some open source project you can contribute to. For the open source projects you can contribute even if you're \"only\" writing tests, documentation etc - that's a really valuable contribution, and demonstrates some commitment and could quite easily lead to contributing fixes and features in the future.",

The job is entirely dependent on having a practical understanding of how data is consumed downstream of its production, and you just cannot have a clue if you haven't spent a few years of your life, well, consuming data.\n\n80-90% of the DEs I know have basically the same story. STEM degree(s), 2-6 YoE in Data, legitimate interest in software engineering (reading books, recreational programming, etc), makes the transition by learning the trade directly from the DEs working under the same roof.

Being able to support Spark, Pandas, Polars, Snowpark, DuckDB etc. with one API is super powerful.\n\nThat said, what it’s still missing (last time I checked) is **declarative configuration** — you’d still need to build a wrapper layer around it for YAML- or metadata-driven validation flows. But it’s a great foundation, and I’m definitely keeping an eye on where it goes!",

It would depend on what you prefer.\n\nMy preference would be to go deep as for 3 YOE you have quite a wide tech stack so becoming an expert in these technologies will take time and possibly be a good value addition for your next role.\n\n1. Definitely be an expert in Python, SQL and either Snowflake or Pyspark. This can be your core. It is a quite wide stack that will certainly get interview calls and this can become your strengths when you talk about yourself in interviews.\n\n2. DBT and Airflow can be next to master. By mastery I mean you should know what are real bugs/limitations you encountered, how you migrated across versions, how you managed deployments of 1000s of models or pipelines, etc. What works for 10 jobs rarely works for 1000s.\n\n3. For good companies data structures and algo will most likely come in picture. Be good at fundamentals around data warehousing, data modeling, data architectures. DDIA is a must read. General system design can become relevant.\n\n4. Streamlit is a very nice to have feature, not sure about job interviews but once you are in a role it will help you shine if you can demonstrate good insights from the data that you are engineering. Same applies for ML engineering.\n\n5. A good background in a database technology can also be a good thing. Postgresql has emerged as a standard but that again is going to take quite some time to master.\n\n  \nAll the best!",

If you have automatic retries enabled on the thing running your dbt model, then you'll retry it after its timed out on the higher warehouse.

Didn't ask a single question, no comments or suggestions. Meeting ends, we all go out for lunch and invite him, he says \"go ahead, there's some personal stuff I need to take care off during the lunch break, see you soon\". The guy never came back. We were all shocked, \"maybe it's something I said?\", \"did he think our architecture was so bad he didn't want to work here anymore?\", etc. I was a little suspicious because in the quick small talk we had he didn't seemed like he was a very experienced programmer, so I asked my boss to send me his GitHub profile. There were dozens, maybe hundreds of repos there. I started to click in each one and... It was all just repos forked from various open source projects with ZERO changes from the guy. So he just basically just forked a bunch of random repos to impress some clueless recruiter and it fucking worked. The guy was a hack, probably didn't understand a word of what we said in that meeting, panicked and never came back.",

I think they are in various stages of \"good\", it kind of depends on your use-case.\n\nFor example, I actually build such a tool, [VerbaGPT.com](http://verbagpt.com/) My tool is focused on *data privacy*. Instead of web-based, users can download my tool to their machine, and then query their CSV, TXT, or SQL (MS-SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL) data. The LLM gets data schema (or parts of it that the user explicitly shares), but doesn't get access to actual data itself. There is also option for offline use with Ollama, but on-device LLMs aren't as good (but rapidly getting better!\\*). My tool also provides a way/process to curate lots of context about databases, tables, columns, etc. - that helps with performance on complex or domain-specific uses.\n\nIn contrast, other tools are easier to get started with since they are web-based. Downside being there is another vendor-in-the-middle that gets access to data. Very few have good support for SQL databases, and those that do are generally text-to-sql, instead of text-to-python. The difference being that with python you can do a lot more, like data modeling, analysis, visualizations etc.\n\nThe State of Art (SOTA) feeds into what can be done with text-to-sql. With [VerbaGPT.com](http://VerbaGPT.com) my vision is that one day domain experts can ask questions in natural language, and get answers. This has two big assumptions. One is that LLMs are good enough to return accurate responses, every time. This isn't where SOTA is at currently, but getting closer. The second is that LLMs are good enough to understand and disambiguate \"user intent\". We have lots of work to do here. The net result is that I don't like auto-execution of code and getting responses in the chat window. I like \"human-in-the-loop\" approach today and for the near-term future, and that is how I designed VerbaGPT to function.\n\nIt's a complicated landscape. I like the tool I built (I'm of course biased), even though it is less polished than some others. Other tools I like include DataLabs by DataCamp (though it became a tad glitchy lately, not sure why). Vanna ai is also something to look into. Databricks has done some neat stuff here as well (but can get expensive with lots of data and compute). \n\n\\*offline processing example: [https://youtu.be/NNiNKOstP5o?si=xp3y1h3dk3JMPLLP](https://youtu.be/NNiNKOstP5o?si=xp3y1h3dk3JMPLLP)",

Thus, many do not actually do much data engineering, funny enough, even though they should. Overall work quality does suffer for this, so don't run your data teams like this.\n\nAt well run orgs the MLEs do data engineering and share ownership of pipelines with data engineers; DEs focus more on ops and moving data to different environments and MLEs focus on transforming data, though there aren't any hard lines, and human to human collaboration is necessary.\n\nIt is unusual to move from DE to MLE, the reverse is a little more common. MLE is a more competitive title: mostly because it is sexier, more people want in, also pay tends to be higher because people assume it is more skilled (I really don't feel this way; median MLE has just superficial knowledge of a few concepts and a few Python APIs, but that's another topic for another day). So companies will prefer to hire MLEs from the pool of people with prior MLE experience, of which there is no shortage of such people on the job market looking for a role, than DEs for MLE roles.",

One of the two may bring it into a dev env but when the model needs to be moved into production the de team usually take over that new data source integration and the mle works on deploying the model. \n\nNote this will vary substantially based on org size and maturity",

We see some people that have their system only built on Postgres / MySQL and can't do analytics queries on top of that. Those people need to introduce OLAP as part of their stack, the value prop of what we offer in that case is that we make the opinionated choices for you, the glue is built in the framework for the different pieces of the stack so you don't have to worry about that. \n\nFor bigger orgs that already have something like a Databrick or a Snowflake, we see data engineering with huge backlogs that has a hard time to respond to demand for analytics. All of the data is pretty alive and fluid and what was the golden standard at day 0 is not so golden at day 100. We are trying to address that with a stack that is optimized for local quick iterations, reducing the time it takes to get something to production.\n\nI hope that helps.\n\nis your experience different? if so, how so?",

Example, you might have a product object that you want to capture as an even and leverage for analytics, define your event data models, toss in the product attributes you need and now you have a typed event that uses your product data model. Mess up the types and your IDE complains, remove a field that the event uses and your IDE complains, and now you have proactive data quality mgmt at build time without implementing a separate tool\n\nAnother part of what we’ve been trying to do is to enable people to configure it with their stack and to incrementally adopt the different parts of the framework.

Doesn't matter if its 10 kB of data, if that's the most important piece of data to the company, and you are responsible for maintaining it, then you have a vital role. \n\nIn my experience, I've tried to get really good and efficient in the domains that I am responsible for and always find ways to improve there. I ask questions like: Can I automate this a little more? Can I add some fault handling or error handling? Can I set this up to be triggered to run instead of running on a schedule? By solving some of these questions, you allow yourself to quantify your impact to the business, which goes a long way in showcasing your skills and upgrading to a new role.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about a particular tech or skill you don't have, because you can always try to pick them up on a personal project or training, and there's always a possibility in the future for a use case, especially if your are looking for one. The way I see it, you're already experienced in Azure, a big cloud platform. Don't sell yourself short, you might be able to make a nice lateral move to work on bigger projects.\n\nSide note, I used to work in manufacturing as well, and I sort of miss it.

Would be curious actually about how this turns out.\n\nWhat I normally do is instead I will have my “source table” with all data that is partitioned yearly as my “cold” storage. I will then incrementally build another table that is just maybe 1 year or month worth of data partitioned by month or day as my “hot” storage. Yes I am duplicating data but the compute cost to query is significantly less. This is also very easy to do with dbt. Also cost of storage is cheap which is a big selling point of Apache Iceberg in the first place.\n\nEdit: And of course anyone who needs more data will accept that increased cost and simple go to the full history table.",

It means that people that are familiar with that system can use your data platforms to get at the data they need, without having to put strain on the original source.\n\nAnother thing you could do is, with the 'internal tables, if some team wants access to some state like that you just make a copy of the model and call it a published one just for that team. You should then able to make changes to the original model to suit your own needs, and they've got something stable. It does mean you might have two materialisations, and you'll have two dependencies, but it might be worth it.\n\nYou still might have a bit more going on with the source-replica styled tables. People might want a history of the data in there, for example, so you might still run raw staging copies, then produce 'latest' and 'full history' representations of the data. It generally isn't hard to do both, since the latter gets you the former, so you can make it a standard that every time you ingest a new source you create these representations to provide to anyone that needs it so they can get quick access.\n\nLater down the line you'll have to grapple with data governance issues, but in a small org it can be handled more directly.",

The \"myth\" of focusing only on technical excellence felt a bit like a strawman – most engineers I know realize communication matters, even if they don't prioritize it enough. And promotions often involve more complex factors than just technical skill vs. relationships (like scope, leadership potential, strategic impact).\n\nBut overall, a valuable perspective on needing more than just coding chops.

Trying to put everything at once will take you a long time and you won’t be able to validate your progress and maybe you’ll stop in the middle because it was too long and you don’t see the project ending anytime soon.\n\nFirst focus on ingestion.\nThis will guide you collect data from a source and store it.\n\nYou can try a couple different sources here like REST api, web sockets, MQTT topics, GraphQL API, just here you can have some fun.\n\nDo things simple, use simple python and once it’s working THEN try to improve if you want ti make it faster or what ever.\n\nThen focus on transformation \nLoad the data from S3 to Snowflake. It doesn’t have to be automated. Ingest enough to have a couple of hour/days worth of data for your need and load that at once into snowflake.\n\nNow configure your first DBT project and make sure you are able to connect to snowflake using DBT debug command.\n\nThen clean and transform your raw data to something meaningful.\n\nNote that before you start the ingestion step you should know what’s the first thing you want to achieve. If you don’t this won’t work. Find something you want to know then find the data source for it, not the other way around. It’s always more fun to do something which have some value for you. \n\nThen work on testing you ingesting code and you transformation. Might be boring, but it’s a needed skill.\n\n\nThen focus on automation. Configure your airflow module and orchestrate  you ingestion module on a schedule with your DBT transformation from a trigger when the ingestion for a specific partition is done.\n\nThen you can start looking into streaming.\nConfigure your infrastructure (Kafka, or red pandas or what ever you want)\n\nThen modify your ingestion module so it send events instead of full set of data. For example if you were collecting all weather records from all country well don’t wait for the complete process to be finished, yield events as you consume them to your Kafka stream.\n\nThen configure your ingestion engine spark/flink/quix/bytewax and run some transformation on real time data.\n\nThen try to configure some threshold will would alert you in real time if xyz happen, if the temperature increase from x in the last hour.\n\nThen work on building beautiful dashboards.\n\nThen you can try to consolidate all pieces together.\n\nThis is never a small project, and doing everything at once won’t bring you where you want. Do small integration instead. You’ll get completion reward as you go and you will be more willing to continue instead of dropping because the scope is to complex.\n\nCheers and good luck",

Back in 2017 I remember wanting to throw my laptop against the wall just trying to get Spark to run locally lol.\n\nWhat I would recommend is instead of trying to do multiple things in a project, just pick one thing and focus on that. And while PySpark is fine, unless you already feel very comfortable in SQL, I’d suggest devoting more time to it as that is the one language all Data Engineers need to know very well and you can even use it in PySpark. Also you may want to consider DuckDB as it could also just be an easier way to accomplish transforming your data.\n\nWhile NoSQL is definitely useful, it isn’t something I’d suggest anyone just getting started to even consider. Stick with CSV or even better, parquet.\n\nAlso if you do BI, I’d suggest streamlit as it is Python based and they have free hosting to show off your project.\n\nLastly and I know I’m being nit picky, but Scala isn’t dying, it is just the use cases where you need to use it over Python are only at massive scale. I’d steer most new people away from it just because it isn’t as marketable of a skill.\n\nEdit: fixed wording",

So in the end I wrote everything by hand rather than trying to untangle the shit that was spewed out by the LLM. \n\ntil;dr learn how to program first, then consider trying AI tools later.",

There is so much to learn and know that you don't get anywhere near enough of in school. Python programmers are a dime a dozen. (Sorry Python people.)\n\nAssuming you want to be more than a code cutter...\n\nFirst and foremost, study SQL. Eat it. Breath it. Drink it. Think in it. Sets and set theory are your best friends (remember 2nd grade?).\n\nAfter that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1iw9pe4/comment/mec9u94/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) is a previous post that covers a good start. A second, more focused on data warehousing is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1j9lyg8/comment/mheoy1h/?context=3).\n\nUnderstand the difference between operational data (where flows are important, the data sizes smaller and response time is critical) and analytic data (large to huge dataset sizes, storage costs become a factor). Most of the analytic data in the cloud is in 1NF(-ish) style and as such limits what can be done with it without starting over. Most cloud tools have a sweet spot that is in the operational spectrum.\n\nSorry for all the links, but data is a huge subject. It is far bigger than the nuances of any programming language. It is very rare for screwing up in a program gets you fined or thrown in jail. Getting fired is the low end of the scale. Data screwups have the potential for all of them.",

AI, at least as it stands today, is not a replacement. It’s more like a really good assistant, but they can only muster up what you can properly describe… so the results are still limited by a lowest common denominator— You.\n\nI am a firm believer tho, that someday, technical syntax will become highly abstracted away from us as AI tooling becomes more fixated on doing absolutely everything between pre and post conditions. Very likely, we’ll end up with a more friendly language to describe the semantics for end-users, and the syntax used by AI will be at a low enough level as to effectively build what the user requests. Anyways, dreams for the future.. for the next decade or two, honing a strong foundation in how to program/query/architect solutions will be be very beneficial to everything else you do, including using AI tooling its fullest.",

Your resume is meant to give the company looking to hire you an idea of what their employees can look like if they hire you, or how you can make their team better. \n\nThis means that you need to tailor your cover letter and resume to the job you are applying for every single time. Yes, this is a lot of work. Yes, it's a pain in the butt to do. Yes, you should still be doing this.\n\nPlease make sure you are tailoring things to your audience when you make your applications. Just because you have the titles doesn't mean that you are showing you are of value, or that you are summarizing your capabilities effectively. Dressing things up matters A LOT in these cases!",

I actually landed Unilever as a client and did 3 projects with them through the platform as a data analyst.\n\n\\- Large / corporates hire freelancers through recruiting firms. That's called contracting. Those project usually last 3-18 months and are almost always full-time. They are great to get started as a freelancer as they pay very well but you will depend on just one client.  \n  \nI have a community of data freelancers so I can testify that yes it's a viable career path. \n\nEnough talk.

In case 1 (copy on write) all the parquet files containing the deleted rows are rewritten in a new file to omit those rows,  and then the metadata json files are updated to point at the new parquet files. In the second case (merge on read), a special metadata file called a deletion vector is written that identifies which rows in which parquet files to ignore on read. For performance, every so often you do the steps of the first method and produce rewritten compacted parquet files. Stale parquet files that are no longer referenced by any current metadata files can be deleted via an operation called \"Vacuuming\".most of this happens automatically with the \"DELETE...\" or \"VACUUM\" Spark SQL operations.",

In a parquet table, the files are directly replaced (no time travel). This is handled for you based on the type of write operation you choose (overwrite, merge). Appends of course happen with no data deletion. \n\nFile organization is abstracted as well. Each table has a directory based on its name (or a location you assign). This is why hierarchical namespace (in azure terms) is required over the storage account. If you determine there is a need to partition the data on some column, in which case a directory structure is created for you, with files generated in those directories containing only the data matching a column value to directory partition.",

You mentioned GCP, but I wouldn’t rule out AWS or Azure. In fact, I would look to see if there are any companies trying to migrate from on-prem Oracle stacks to cloud based ones and see which cloud provider they tend to go for (I would guess Azure but that’s just a guess) and then get a cert in that. That way you can leverage your old and new skills together. \n\nGood luck.",

Which also isn't expensive and hard, it's just a matter of choosing proper model and proper promt.

Another popular option is [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) (open-source), which brings ACID transactions to your data lake while maintaining compatibility with Spark processing.\n\nFor enriching and connecting your data sources within this pipeline, [Windsor.ai](http://Windsor.ai) offers specialized integration capabilities. It helps consolidate disparate data channels into a unified view, making it valuable for the monitoring and reporting aspects you mentioned in your requirements.\n\nGiven your internship context, start small with a proof of concept pipeline using these tools before scaling. Documentation resources like the \"Fundamentals of Data Engineering\" book by Joe Reis/Matt Housley and the [DataTalksClub GitHub ](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)repository provide excellent learning materials for beginners in this space.",

This is mostly for Material Master Data, Procurement Info Records and Business Partners or other Master Data. The tool also includes automated flows to check and update data and ensure compliance. SAP MDG pushes these entries to the ERP System.\n\nFor Passive Data Governance (data cleansing) we extract SAP ERP, CRM, EWM Data via \"SAP Data Services\" (classic RFC connection) and bring it into \"SAP information Steward\". Within this tool you can create Data Quality Rules with an SAP Script (kind of SQL like). Then we automatically distribute these generated cleansing files to the required business owners according to the scheduler.\n\nOn Top of that we have a PowerBI monitoring the progress of data quality for these data quality rules.\n\nAs you see we are rather SAP heavy. On one hand it's SAP which sometimes can be \"special\" on the other hand the integration works well.",

        "body": "I've won hackathons before. Best tip is to practice with an existing team, as a team, and do mock hackathons.  \n\nIf you know react, and what packages to download, you can build something in less than 12 hours.  \n\nFirst 4 hours might be planning and reading the docs, 4 hours of sleep, 4 hours to clean up and submit. 12 hours of productive coding.  \n\nWe can break down the 12 hours even further if you want, but assume also each team member knows what they are doing and we can do it in parallel.  \n\nInitialize the git repo, frontend, backend and database on local host with a decided framework. Database can be hosted on the cloud. Frontend is probably react, or vue, with tailwind css or bootstrap as the UI framework or use another one with copy and paste components. Backend can be flask or django, or if you want, ignore backend completely and just connect frontend to the database directly. (don't do this with real production code). (takes around 1-2 hours)  \n  \nYour team of four starts splitting up work. One or two guys start working on frontend with the UI framework. One guy working on util libraries and business logic as well as api and webhooks. Another guy working on the database. You may have a floater or a guy that finished early to do merges and resolving merge conflicts. (3-6 hours)\nWorking in parallel will require constantly preplanning what tasks are important that have a lot of other tasks dependent on it and which tasks have a lot of dependencies itself. (but at this point you should be polishing up) (3-6 hours)  \n  \nCloud hosting is quick and easy nowadays, should only take 1-2 hours. It might take a while to figure out the dockerfile and which cloud hosting platform will help the most.\nIf you know what you are doing, and use existing open source frameworks and solutions, you can cut down the time spent writing boilerplate code and just focus on connecting API calls and endpoints.  \n\n----\n# Just a few tips\n  \n1. Already find your team of four and practice with them before the competition. Treat it like a war game if you want. Go into what if scenarios and try and build real projects together.  \n  \n2. Look into the hackathons previous winners and losers from previous hackathons. Try and figure out how the judges pick the winners.  \nDo the judges really care about ML technologies? or do they just care about fancy UI? Some judges care about how many microservices you used and/or how big your techstack us. Do a lot of preplanning to figure out what the judges like.  \n  \n3. As the competition gets near, usually company names start appearing, judges names start appearing, as well as the challenge names. Do a lot of research on the companies and judges.  \n  \nIf you wanna score points from a company, look into what API libraries they might want you to use. If you want to score points with a judges, and they are industry or professor, do a challenge that they can relate to.  \n  \n4. Never rebuild the wheel. Use other people's code. Use open source frameworks and code from github.\nNo hackathon winner will ever build their entire stack. The use frameworks and existing solutions. The only thing they will build themselves are the connections between the frontend and the backend as well as the business logic.  \n  \n5. Add as much techstack and bloat as you can. Host it on a bunch of microservices, use OAuth, host it on the cloud. Add infinite horizontal scaling. Judges for some reason like that, even if it does nothing for your app.  \n  \n6. The app doesn't even have to work. It only needs to seem like it works.\n   \n---\n  \nWinning hackathons is a specific skill, and only some of it is transferable to actual industry. Over representing your app to judges probably isn't something you will do in industry, and hard coding stuff is probably something you won't do.  \n  \nBut the best tip is to just practice and get good at using other people's code.",

Two or three years as the associate / coffee run kid at a cash strapped startup might give you the education to step up. \n\nIt will depend on where your mind is.

And it's not just historical figures like a textbook, he does explain things like how vacuum tubes worked and *why* certain things developed the way they do, like how CS concepts we consider foundational today were being theorized/implemented to invent devices to accurately. Lots a little fun facts you can repeat to sound smart at parties too which I appreciate from any book.... like how a committee inventing machines to calculate the necessary settings to aim anti-aircraft kinda just offhandedly invented the term \"digital\", humble beginnings for a word that defines the modern day.  \n\n\nDefinitely recommend, especially if you like history or are a little shaky on certain CS topics. Really having a good explanation of how a vacuum tube actually works before moving onto microprocessors really helped the IRL \"tech tree\" make so much more sense to me, and now if you ask me what a microprocessor is, I won't any longer respond by saying \"idk, shit that low level is just magic to me\"",

People here are saying \"no\" but it's more complicated than that on modern architecture. Yes, they can slow down your loop if the branch predictor guesses wrong, because the CPU pipeline will have to flush its pending work. But branch predictors are pretty good, so unless the if statement is very unpredictable or 50/50, you'll be fine.\n\nedit: As far as optimizing if statements out of loops, sometimes you can split the loop into two loops with separate logic, and that allows you to extract the if statement outside the loop. Alternatively you can look into branchless programming, which usually relies on methods like boolean algebra. But don't go too deep into the world of micro-optimizations, 9/10 times it is a waste of your time unless you have definite specifications that require it.",

        "body": "So, IF statements most of the times, are two (or one) instructions in your processor, the compare instruction, which will set flags bits in a special register, and a second part after that, that will execute only if the flag bits are set, it could be a call, could be a jump, whatever. In modern ISAs, you typically see cmp and jump instructions bundled in the same one, this would be executed faster than two instructions, but the jump offset addressing is usually smaller.\n\nHow fast are those instructions? Well that would depend on the architecture, but I assume they are done in a cycle easily.\n\nOf course, if you don't need the IF, your program would obviously be faster, because you reduced the need for an extra instruction.\n\nBut in reality, it shouldn't make it that much slower (remember one instruction only), but since IF is used to cover side cases, it'll obviously make your program bigger, how big you may ask? Depends on what the compiler optimizes the if to, it could be a branch with a link, it could be a skip, etc...\n\nIf you're strictly testing loop scenarios, just think to yourself \"every time I run this loop, I am doing an additional instruction\" so if the loop is 8 instructions long, and one of them is the IF instruction, then yeah, it would make it somewhat slower. So yeah, if you're doing a loop that loops 1 billion times, and you tracked the  time it took, you could probably see a noticeable difference.",

        "body": "Here's a breakdown of some good learning resources:\n\nFrontend:\n\n\\-Scrimba's frontend career path is endorsed by MDN and has a unique teaching style. Not overly comprehensive and could be great paired alongside Frontend Mentor for projects.\n\n\\-Frontend Mentor is great for practice projects.\n\n\\-The Odin Project is probably the most comprehensive resource for frontend online but its not for everyone. There is tons of reading and it takes much, much longer to complete than other souces. However, its up to date and really enforces the fundamentals. Might be best to choose another resource if your focus is backend though since this goes deeper into frontend than you'd probably need to know.\n\n\\-FreeCodeCamp launched a new curriculum recently. I haven't tried it but it looks pretty good.\n\nBackend:\n\n\\-Boot.dev is a newer resource that teaches backend fundamentals in a \"gameified\" learning experience where you earn XP from completing problems. Probably one of (if not the) best resource for learning general backend skills, my only gripe is their focus on Go. Go isn't as in demand as some other backend langauges, but they are launching a Typescript path soon for those who don't want to learn Go.\n\n\\-Hyperskill is a lesser known resource where you get lots of hands-on practice. I used this website to learn Java and I can't recommend it enough. The projects are great and after every lesson you are given plenty of practice problems. The only downside is that its a little unclear when you should start on projects and some of the practice problems pull from content you haven't learned yet but other than that its a great platform that has integration with Jetbrains IDEs.\n\n\\-The Odin Project also covers Node.js if you're interested in that. They also have a Ruby on Rails path but I wouldn't recommend it.\n\n\\-Since you mentioned C#, I've heard good things about [https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/) although I haven't tried it myslef. Also Microsoft recently launched a full stack developer course on Coursera using C# for backend.\n\nWhether you want to learn frontend or backend first is really up to you, just make sure you apply your skills once you learn them with practice projects. The platforms I listed here are all really good about making you practice the skills you've learned. That's why I didn't recommend Udemy courses, because while there are some instructors that do a good job teaching, projects usually involve you just watching them code and copying what they do. I could see using Udemy for frontend paired with Frontend Mentor though, Colt Steele and Jonas Schmedtmann are probably your best bet for that. Also, I would avoid the full stack developer bootcamps on Udemy, since they are often just surface-level knowledge. Lastly, if you ever plan on getting a CS degree I would go with WGU. Very affordable university that lets you go at your own pace. You can proabably get it done in 2-3 years depending on how much time you have (I'm on track to finish in about 3 years, although I've kinda been slacking). Hope this helps!",

Cyber you can get in to on your own by doing online courses and certifications but this is less programming and more just security information. \n\nPython is generally recommended for beginners. \n\nI would look at JS especially the fancy frameworks like next and react and some new one that came out that probably came out as I am typing this. \n\nIf you want low level stuff I think rust is pretty cool.

If you're working with a different library/framework every few days, then yeah, it's going to go slow until you get really familiar with those libraries, and it's going to go even slower as you keep adding new ones.\n\nI know I've written modules with, say, 500 lines of code, but it took me writing 5,000 lines of code trying to work out an optimal solution, and most of it got deleted because various things didn't work the way I wanted them to.

Lets take on C++ strings and string processing first, then.   Try doing the basic stuff... make a string from a constant, append to it, find a substring, convert it to uppercase, and so on.  All those common things you do regularly.   Use only C++, no cheating and using c-string tools or the string to cstring conversion.\n\nFrom there, I would master the vector class.  You don't have to understand the template syntax fully yet, just know that its vector<any type> variablename format and work it from there.  Work the learncpp chapter on vectors hard.\n\nNOW, with your feet a little wetter, give classes and object oriented programming chapters a look, and start working that stuff.\n\nA couple of things to forget from C for a while:  \npointers.  Just forget them for now.  You can circle back later, but code without using any at all for a while.  Iterators are OK to use.  \nmacros.  Don't use them unless strictly necessary, like a debug tool to spew a line number.  As with pointers, just don't go there for a while, get used to coding without them, and circle back later once the C is a bit of a distant memory and less of a habit.\n\nAs you move forward, I would alternate a day to study c++ differences with a chapter or two on the deep topics.  For example (literally!), the c++ for loop has a new twist, you can iterate over a container with loops that look like for(type &t : container) and t will advance through the elements of container, becoming each one in turn.  If referenced, its the real value, if not, its a copy, and that is a big deal for performance and behaviors both, to get that & or not absolutely correct.  This is similar but not exactly akin to something like for(int \\*ip = arrayname; ip < &arrayname\\[max\\]; ip++)",

They iterate over and over and over again. It is REALLY hard, even for the best designers out there, to achieve a perfectly designed websited from a blank canvas. You build something that kind of works and kind of looks good, and then you improve on that. Then you test, gather feedback, and improve again, ad infinitum.\n\nEdit: learning this is quite fun tbh. I am doing a lot with just HTML and CSS nowadays, and it's a great way to relax after programming, lol. Think of it like painting. You have an idea in your head, visually, and you want to produce that on a canvas.",

        "body": "I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and used to work as a [backend developer](https://roadmap.sh/backend) for multiple companies including Amazon. For the list of common professions in the Computer Science world, see: \n\nhttps://roadmap.sh/ \n\nI'm going to go through what you wrote one line at a time.\n\n> \"So, I'm in my first year of college and honestly, everything in tech seems super interesting—whether it's web development, AI/ML, DevOps, or cybersecurity. The problem is, I don’t know which one to choose, as I don't know much about them.\"\n\nYou start with the foundations that they all have in common. For example, regardless of whether you are doing full-stack web development in JavaScript, Machine Learning development in Python, DevOps scrips in bash, PowerShell, or Python, or red team cybersecurity penetration testing scripts in Python, you have to know how to code. First, you need to learn programming fundamentals like variables, integers, Strings, booleans, conditions, operators, loops, functions, etc. Then after that, you need to learn Object Oriented Programming (OOP) like classes, class inheritance (subclasses), interfaces, methods vs. functions, etc. At some point you should probably also take a class called \"discrete math\" that covers the math of logic (and, or, not, true, false, etc.). This class (in the University of Michigan course list): \n\nhttps://eecs203.github.io/eecs203.org/ \n\nAlso, for most of those specialties, a Computer Networking class is also useful (note that this is a 400 level class, so students usually take it in their 4th year of undergraduate university studies): \n\nhttps://github.com/mosharaf/eecs489\n\n> \"Everyone says, 'Pick what interests you,' but that’s the thing—I like all of it, and it’s kinda confusing.\"\n\nYou don't have to pick a specialty in Computer Science right away. Look at the list at https://roadmap.sh/ and know you can be in university for years before deciding on a specialty. Sometimes you don't even make a conscious decision, life circumstances and availability end up deciding for you. Like I know one guy who graduated with a Computer Science degree but couldn't get a coding job but did land an on-premise server I.T. job, and then he ended up going that route and eventually managing/supervising a huge number of on-premise servers. Circumstances ended up choosing for him.\n\n> \"How can I try out these different fields for a small amount of time and figure out what I actually enjoy the most?\"\n\nMaybe check out various subreddits, follow them, and eventually send professionals in those subreddits chat requests to ask them about their profession. To help me find subreddits, I start with a Reddit search and then use The Map of Reddit (Google \"Map of Reddit\", it's a website to help you find related or interconnected subreddits). For example, for Machine Learning there is r/MachineLearning and r/LearnMachineLearning , maybe r/DataScience . For experienced developers there is r/ExperiencedDevs . For backend developers there is r/backend . There is also r/fullstack , r/WebDev , and r/frontend . Then there are subreddits for the individual programming languages like r/java , r/LearnJava , r/Python , r/LearnPython , etc.\n\n> \"I'd really appreciate some simple advice on where to start and how to explore without feeling overwhelmed.\" \n\nStart with the foundations that multiple different professions in the tech industry have in common. For example, backend developers, data science people, data analytics people, data engineers, and software engineering team managers all need to know databases and SQL. Thus, this class, Database Management Systems, should be a class you take at some point: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1JK6_nmwkouMnU3gtD9AF085hR_LhPKIL1bVPzRAS8MA/mobilebasic?pli=1 \n\nBut yeah, start with establishing a foundation that spans across multiple different professions. Keep your body and mind healthy and sharp, and never stop learning so you can pivot as necessary. Who knows what will be most in demand when you graduate.",

In that case, you can learn another things and can adapt for career changes.\nAnd it is better you are currently in formal education, in which they will teach you everything but generally with foundation (No specific framework, no specific language).\n\nSo choose wisely, things you love to build and things people want to pay.\nForm my experience, I can say that web development is a best suitable field for beginners to START ( I didn’t said it was easy) because you will learn foundation of networking, programming, and other cs related things.\nThe more you grap the knowledge, the more you can adapt.\n\nSo as final advice, be an engineer, not a frameworker, try to solve the problem using tool, don’t try to learn how to use all of the tools.\n\n(I am not professional btw :P)",

If there are a lot, then you're learning the right language.  \n\nIf there aren't, then it's not entirely useless. Learning any language will teach you some coding principles and practices. This is good, because the ideas are transferrable to other languages. And if you're in school learning computer programming as a concept, you may as well learn them in the language it's being taught in. But bear in mind you'll have to learn the more popular language, like Python, when you've graduated.   \n\nSo let's assume you're learning the wrong language. For instance, maybe the employers in your town all use Python instead. How do you get ahead? My suggestion is to find out what is the most popular language used by the industry in your town, and then start a club on campus where you *teach* it. To be able to teach it, go to [Software-Carpentry.org](http://Software-Carpentry.org) . They have courses that are ready to teach in a variety of popular languages, it's just a matter of learning how to teach the curriculum, and doing the work to practice teaching it. Luckily, they also have self-paced courses that teach you how to teach. And by teaching, you learn.  \n\nOnce you've graduated, saying that you TAUGHT a popular language at a university club will make you stand out.",

Nonetheless you can learn programming basics with it, very well, and use the knowledge for other languages later on. You just need to learn to adapt to a new syntax/library functions.\n\nKnowledge of Assembly is good! It will teach you how computers work internally, and what high-level languages work with. Knowing it, you will be able to write more efficient and realistic code. But it is only seldom used nowadays in application programming. It is used in some embedded projects, even when C compilers are way more standard, or platforms running slim interpreters for script languages. It is still useful for some isolated use cases for extreme hand-tuned optimizations, hacking, reverse-engineering etc.\n\nThe Graphic design you describe as making graphics with basic library functions by a basic or assembly header, I understand. Well, it is toddler stuff fpr beginners imho. You can learn programming with it, and collect experience. But later you will have to move on and learn to use more professional solutions for graphics design.\n\nEven if you study these topics in university, I'd recommend you to privately stay busy with more widespread, professional components, i.e. python, java(-script)/typescript, C/C++, ... Another benefit of these languages is, aside possible involvement in way more professional production projects, that you can massively learn from the open source scene using these languages, i.e. on GitHub, and you can get all the tools and docs you need for free from the internet!",

I think that you end up with lots of holes in your knowledge if you just hack away at something without some sort of guide. I don't agree with your friend, partially because AI currently produces terrible code and is often wrong about what it does, and partially because having a conceptual framework is important to software development in order to apply existing knowledge to new problems. If you only have a mechanistic understanding, then you have to spend time learning every single time you are presented with something new, instead of applying existing knowledge. \n\nThat being said, learning by doing is the best way to remember what you learned and to get a sense of how to apply it. Having an entirely conceptual understanding of something is not useful either.",

How often the code changes, how solid your requirements are, what your dependencies look like, etc. During development it's a huge boon to already have tests written that you can use to exercise your code path. If not TDD just as an assist to get your debugger to hit while you're sorting out the quirks. If your shipping an SDK or package especially unit tests are important.\n\nI have a personal preference to dislike unit style tests for applications. My experience with them is that you end up with a lot of test cases, that's a lot of code to maintain. Most if it is repeated and exercising the same part of a function dozens of times. I often find unit tests that aren't testing anything at all, but rather validating assumptions of the language or platform, which is completely inappropriate and a waste of time. I've read plenty of great unit tests too, I've just grown exhausted pruning and curating them.\n\nWhat people don't often account for is that tests aren't just expensive to write, but they can be expensive to maintain too. Because of this, I prefer a smaller curated set of tests that cover larger scenarios than a 'code unit'. Not integration tests, but something that exercises the actual intent of the application as thoroughly as possible while not requiring real dependencies to be set up. Then I use a comprehensive monitoring solution to detect when edge cases occur in our production environment.\n\nEverything is a trade off. What I think gets missed in discussions about QA is how a poor ROI on one QA solution can eat time that would otherwise be spent on a different one.",

I use them to experiment and test things.  \n\n\n1. Make a new project\n2. Make a readme file\n3. Put the project in git\n\n\nAfter this you can look up some small coding challenges and slowly add them to the project. Things you can do in 60 minutes or less. Once you have some momentum and confidence start working on bigger things. \n\n\nFinal though: IF you feel like you don't know how to code stop messing with libraries and frameworks. Just stick to one of the primary languages and get very comfortable with that. You need a foundation, putting up walls before the concrete is poured is silly. ",

[https://www.ponggame.org](https://www.ponggame.org)\n\nThis is a simple game, but has all of the elements you want to practice:\n\n* Initialize game screen \n* player options\n* start game loop\n* scoring and updating text\n* animating sprites (little pictures that move on screen)\n* player control of sprites\n* physics\n* pausing or stopping a game session\n* quitting the program.\n\nEvery game has these elements. Modern games use an \"engine,\" which is really a collection of software components to pre-write all of the above. \n\nHere it is in Python: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-pong-game-using-python-turtle/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-pong-game-using-python-turtle/) .\n\nStudy the code, understand the code, make a better one.\n\nnext, move up to Doom. Doom is a \"2 1/2d\" game. It looks 3d, but it uses clever tricks and is really not.\n\nThis repository has code for one [https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-style-Game](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-style-Game) .\n\nThat said, this is an order of magnitude more complex so google Doom in Python and do a good amount of reading. \n\nIf you make it through both of those projects you will be ready to start looking at real 3d games. Keep in mind while you can do 3D in Python, it will be slow. 3D games use some form of C. or a related compiled language. Full on game development environments like Unreal Engine have optimized libraries and allow you to create at a very high level and then build the game executable. \n\nGame development is a long road.

In addition, since your specifically interested in web development, I'd recommend the Odin project. It has a lot of front end stuff, and it is really well made I think (also free). The two of those combined should really set you up for both backend and frontend development. Some other great resources are freeCodeCamp, Coursera, and edX. Coursera and edX have some free courses, I think Harvard's CS50 is often the go to recommend for a first course in coding on here. freeCodeCamp is just awesome in my opinion. They produce so much content on so much, everything from LLMs to web development to making video games.",

Then you'll learn the most necessary parts of basic web development using HTML, CSS, JS. Then, backend systems, and then, you'll learn about frontend JS frameworks. Finally, you'll build a real project, an application that you would use. That's just the practical stuff, though. There are plenty of lessons that go into CS concepts like OOP, Data Structure & Algorithms, etc.  \n  \nOn top of that, you'll learn how to build a network. Going into 3 more years of college with that skill and you will definitely have a job before you graduate. \n\nOh, and your classmates who are getting paid for their side projects? Well, part of the program is to get your own client, make a little money, and beef up your resume.\n\nI started 100devs December 2021 with basically no coding knowledge and had a job by September 2022 with no CS degree; I'm employed today and the skills I learned there have kept me well above that pack of other folks with the same YOE and degrees. It is more of a Job program than a bootcamp, but the way the coding is taught is really easily digestible. Technically, the program is like 7-9 months, but I finished(including the big project) in about 5, and that was with a job and other adult responsibilities; I imagine a summer would be enough time to get through it if you don't have much else going on. I tried to stick to the two classes a week schedule like when they did it live, but it didn't take long before I was watching at 2x and skipping big portions of the videos, so accelerating is definitely possible.\n\nLots of people say \"Build stuff\", \"Do projects\", etc.; I think that's definitely something you should do, but it isn't super helpful for someone in your position. You'll build lots of things with the technologies that you're learning doing 100devs.\n\nBest of luck!",

Unless your goal is to research new algorithms, then those are indeed all of the steps - and yet there's an enormous amount of nuance and complexity hidden there.\n\n1. Bring in the data - this part is easy if someone else has already done the hard work of collecting the data, but in many real-world scenarios the data hasn't been collected yet, so this might involve building apps, sites, custom tools, scrapers, whatever is necessary to collect the data for your particular application.\n\n2. Clean and prepare - this can be quite subtle and nuanced. If you accidentally bring in any features that are biased or correlated with the class you're trying to predict, your model will overfit and you might not realize it until months later when it fails to work in production.\n\n3. Call the class of algorithm and fit - this seems easy when all of your data fits in RAM, but once you start trying to train on hundreds of terabytes worth of data, this is no longer simple. Also, when you have to wait days to train instead of minutes or hours, it becomes far more important to figure out how to validate your approach on smaller subsets first before trying to train on everything.\n\n4. Predict - in most real-world scenarios you're not just calling predict once, you're trying to take that model and embed it into an app so that it can do real-time predictions. This means figuring out how to take a lot of the cleaning and preparing steps from training and recreating them in some other environment, plus dealing with all sorts of other error cases.",

So to make it here you're going to need to shift your expectations, and really commit to learning properly and at pace.\n\nIt can be done.

I am trying to align your expectations to be more realistic so you have a better chance of success if you're actually serious about this being more than a fun hobby.\n\nThe level you are at now (know the basics of HTML and CSS, and a little bit of interaction from JS) is where I would expect someone to be after a few weeks.

So have a serious think about if you want to do this, and if you do commit and set yourself up for success.\n\nFor a junior role you will need: \n\n\\- A solid understanding of TypeScript\n\n\\- A solid understanding of some front end frameworks / libraries (React & MUI/Mantine/Shad-CN)\n\n\\- A solid understanding of some backend framework (Express/Hono/etc)\n\n\\- A solid understanding of testing\n\n\\- A solid understanding of databases and ORMs\n\n\\- A solid understanding of surrounding tech such as GitHub & Actions etc.\n\n  \nNobody, in 2025, is building websites with basic HTML and CSS. That is how we did it back in 1999. And commercial work is going to require that you have the skills and understanding necessary to work in a modern way. \n\nThe bar to entry is high. That's why the pay is also good.\n\nYou can do this. But understand that you are currently on step one of a one-hundred step journey.",

To stick with your example, attempting to create your own Carousel module might seem tedious, but it might be great practice nonetheless. Understanding how it works in its core principle is important for you to be able to be able understand how somebody else's Carousel module has been implemented so you may be able to add such a package and implement it efficiently and as intended in future projects.\n\nThe order of importance is\n\n1. UNDERSTAND\n\n2. Import\n\n3. Adjust\n\nToo many freaking people skip step 1.

        "body": "Hey exact same boat here, untreated ADHD, graduated in December from WGU and work full-time as a mobile diesel technician with an ever changing schedule. I hit it extremely hard with the job search and have only had two interviews first one for full-time junior dev, I bombed. Second one, was an internship at the same company, position got pulled because the current state of our economy. That really killed my motivation.\n\nAfter that I pretty much didn’t touch my laptop until about the middle of March, where there was the first local in person hackathon in my city. I signed up and started to get excited about programming again…and then extremely nervous, because up to that point I realized I got through the degree because the “thought process” & “project requirements” were given to me pretty much on a silver platter. With a mediocre grasp on the fundamentals and no real problem solving experience I didn’t want to look incompetent in front of people that were likely much younger and realistically more experienced than me. So, I went to roadmap.sh and started from the beginning with JavaScript. I got reacquainted with the basics and nuances and went to the event, I was in a group of 4, one took building out the frontend, ironically another guy was currently enrolled with WGU as well and he took the backend, the other was our pitch person and that left me as a floater to just help wherever I could. This was the absolute best position for me! the frontend was next.js/tailwind, backend was spring boot with a Postgres db. I remembered enough about the backend and how everything “worked” that I was able to help there anytime our backend guy got stuck or needed a break and was able to pickup right where he left off, having used typescript at WGU and refreshing my js knowledge I was able to figure out enough of next and tailwind to be helpful there too. This helped in a few ways. Building a fullstack app with stuff I hadn’t used and people I don’t even know in 48hrs showed me 1.) I knew more than I gave myself credit for and 2.) I’m capable and genuinely have a love for programming. \n\nWe lost but since then I have been steadily keeping detailed notes on project ideas that pop in my head at any given time, so I can work through how to actually get started building them and make it a point to spend the downtimes at work to study, listen and consume tech related things and then when I get home in the evenings even if it’s something as simple as writing a function that does something trivial or solving a problem on codewars, I try and code at least something everyday to make it habit. So far I’ve been able to stay pretty consistent with that. \n\nNow that WGU has MSCS programs I’m planning to enroll for that to give me a tangible goal and something to work towards since I doubt the job market is going to turn around anytime soon and I want to gain additional skills in a structured way.\n\nI know most of the advice floating around is to network, grind leetcode, move cities, etc, but for some of us that isn’t a possibility at the moment and I say find some way for you that makes you excited to get home and build that project or learn that tech stack or concept and keep getting better a little at a time until you finally get the opportunity to make the career change!",

They look amazing on resumes.\n\nCreate yourself a LinkedIn page and start networking! There is literally nothing more important than networking in this market. Goto hackathons, tech events in your area, post on linkedin and talk with recruiters etc… \n\nHave all your code public on github.\n\nAnd if you’re serious about perusing a job in this market as a junior make sure you can code without AI and code with AI (not vibe coding but using it as a tool to speed up your development)",

Once you learned TypeScript, you also get used to have a lot of guardrails, and there's no reason to go back to coding without those guardrails as you'll encounter issues at runtime (in the browser console) that will require you to debug more lines of code. \n\nIt's not a shortcoming for JS, because for a senior JS developer it's part of the job to keep a tight ship, code linearity and easily readable unit tests (see examples of Express in JS), but for someone learning: choose TypeScript as long as it is an option (almost always is nowadays).\n\nI even believe that frontend needs TS more than backend, because it's harder to structure frontend for code linearity when you have more important hierarchies such as layouts, components, events, async effects, the DOM... The logic is being called from potentially many different places and it's harder to enforce type consistency everywhere \"by hand\".",

This got me exposure to more programming concepts, experience working on a small team, and a small portfolio of a wide range of applications to pad out my resume without costing a fortune. The applications I ended up with werent fancy, but I put more work into them than I needed to and really tried to experiment where it was allowed.\n\nAfter graduating I started working on personal projects in my free time. I set up a homelab server to learn more about networking and security, and made some small applications that made my life easier both at home and at work. A few of my software solutions got adopted by my company for widespread use. I had fun doing these, but more importantly I was able to replace a lot of the academic work on my resume with these, and it gave me talking points when doing interviews.\n\nI'm not sure if I've just been lucky or not, but I haven't had to do any leetcode in any of my interviews. They have been way more interested in talking about the solutions I made, and the impact they've had. I spent a lot more time practicing talking points, terminology, and having a professional conversation because I'm bad at interviews. In the end I believe this helped set me apart, and I highly recommend spending some time explaining parts of your projects to someone (or even just to an AI).\n\nWhen you do start applying places, spend some time customizing each application for the job  You'd be surprised how many people don't. Also, it helps to format any examples you give in STAR format. Some say it's outdated, but it helps keep things consice while effectively conveying impact.\n\nThe market sucks, but some things don't change. The jobs are still out there, and the people that put in the extra work still stand out. Don't be in a rush, make sure the jobs you interview for are a good fit for you. Hopefully something in here helps you on your journey. Good luck!",

I’m sorry OP..I will echo one of the responders you might be better off seeking some vocational training at a community college over trying to mess with bootcamps…there’s less stigma during hiring with AS Degrees.\n\nJust know without a full blown CS degree the going will be tough and we are currently in the most junior unfriendly hiring market I have ever seen in my 11 years of working in this field. Literally no one is looking for junior devs right now and it’s sad…because there is in fact a shortage of GOOD senior level and mid level devs and engineers BUT in order to get fresh talent we have to train the new incoming juniors…no one wants to do that right now though.",

Remember that much of the AI landscape is built with the idea that it will work with Python and all you lack right now is the practice to merge the two.

Not to say it doesn't happen.\n\nThat said, I've thought about this through the week, and warmed up to the idea somewhat. It does get you into the daily flow of a dev shop, and if you're a likeable social person, it can be a potential route to becoming a dev.\n\nFor your github projects, quality over quantity. 3 meaningful polished projects is better than a dozen shallow ones.\n\nI.e. for the junior python role meaningful could be:  \n\\- a command line tool (like a PDF merger or text cleaner)  \n\\- a simple web app or backend API  \n\\- a data analysis jupyter notebook (with graphs, data cleanups, and a good README)\n\nPersonally I'd start looking at jobs that you'd like to work at, and then asking the AI to suggest good portfolio pieces. Try to find some pieces that'd work for several job advert types that seem common enough and that really interest you.\n\nThat way you're projects are hyper-relevant and will help you stand out.\n\nRe: when to start applying, I'd say start as soon as you have those projects, start applying for junior roles when you 2-3 good portfolio pieces\n\n  \nRe: Leetcode, I'd avoid (or at least not take more than casual approach to it) because (a) small companies or startups don't care about it (b) it's becoming less popular in bigger companies (Snapchat recently reported their stopping using it in interviews week)\n\nIt's really not a good representation of coding, at least in my experience, in my 10 years, I've had to look at algorithms a handful of times.  Maybe it's more relevant in certain teams, but not super common overall.\n\nLet me know if you want help brainstorming project ideas based on job ads, or want feedback on anything you’ve already got brewing 👌",

        "body": "I thought I knew the answer, but apparently I was rather off.  Here is Claude's response\n\nI'll explain how physical memory is partitioned into blocks for contiguous memory allocation in operating systems.\n\nIn contiguous memory allocation, physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks or variable-size partitions that can be allocated to processes. Here's how it works:\n\nPhysical memory is organized into addressable units (typically bytes), and the operating system manages this space by dividing it into partitions or blocks. When processes request memory, the OS allocates these blocks based on specific strategies.\n\nThere are several approaches to partitioning memory:\n\n1. Fixed partitioning: Memory is divided into fixed-size blocks (like your example of 10 MB chunks). Each partition can hold exactly one process, even if the process doesn't need all the allocated space, which can lead to internal fragmentation.\n\n2. Variable partitioning: Memory is allocated exactly as requested by processes, resulting in variable-sized partitions. This reduces internal fragmentation but can lead to external fragmentation as processes terminate and free memory becomes scattered.\n\nFor allocation, the operating system maintains data structures (typically tables) that track:\n- Which blocks are allocated or free\n- The size of each block\n- The process using each allocated block\n\nWhen a process requests memory, the OS uses allocation algorithms such as:\n- First-fit: Allocate the first available block that's large enough\n- Best-fit: Allocate the smallest available block that's large enough\n- Worst-fit: Allocate the largest available block\n\nThe actual implementation involves memory management units (MMUs) that translate logical addresses (used by processes) to physical addresses. These hardware components, along with operating system tables, handle the mapping between a process's address space and physical memory blocks.\n\nModern systems use more sophisticated approaches like paging and segmentation rather than contiguous allocation, as they address many of the fragmentation issues. ",

Be dumb, be unable to solve a problem or write code, the moment you can swallow failure, learning is much easier.",

Yes, examples in video tutorials tend to me very mindless or useless stuff like that. It is something that the book format handles much better. A well designed book will have examples (often they are of the \"useless\" variety but often will be more practical), explanations, and then at the end of each chapter an \"exercises\" part to practice what you learned. And working those \"exercises\" on your own is critical to learning something like this.\n\nIn this respect it's kind of like maths -- yes, you can ask your symbolic calculator to solve integrals for you, but unless you actually do the examples yourself using the techniques shown in the chapter, you won't understand how it \"really\" works. You'll just be feeding in answers from your machine (from your symbolic calculator, for example).",

To know if a library exists for what you're looking for, do a search online or ask people experienced with Python or whatever language you're learning (after doing your own search).",

        "body": "If you want to know \"how Docker works\", that can really be broken down into two separate questions:\n\n1. What Linux kernel features do you use, and how do you use them, to get the behaviors that we call \"containerization\"?\n2. How is the Docker software organized and architected to use those features?\n\nI think question 1 is the more relevant one for what you're asking. [Part 8 of this presentation](https://container.training/intro-selfpaced.yml.html) (the \"Deep dive into container internals\" section) is the best self-contained overview that I know of. For more details, a good starting point would be to read all of the Linux kernel documentation and manpages about cgroups, namespaces, chroot, etc.\n\nThe short version is: the Unix permission system has always provided some basic ability to \"isolate\" processes from each other, e.g. a process belonging to UID can't kill another process with a different UID. This is just enforced by the kernel doing permission checks on the appropriate syscalls. A more interesting example is the `chroot` syscall, which tells the kernel to change the \"apparent\" root directory for a process, so that it can't see or modify any files outside that root. Containerization is just \"chroot on steroids\" by telling the kernel to isolate process groups in various ways.\n\nBeyond that, the \"sharing\" of the kernel works in pretty much the same way that it does without containerization. When a process asks for memory, or the scheduler decides which process to run in a given time slice, the kernel makes the same kind of decision it always does -- except that it keeps track of some extra accounting information to enforce fairness and resource limits between \"containers\".\n\nQuestion 2 is a bit less technically interesting, but still somewhat important because it's useful to know where to look for the relevant source code if you really want to dig into the implementation. For instance, when you run a \"Docker container\", Docker is delegating the work to containerd, and containerd is invoking runc to actually start the container. So runc is where the actual relevant syscalls are made. You can see an overview of *what* runc is doing [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/main/libcontainer/SPEC.md), and you can find more details of how it interacts with the rest of the system by reading the [OCI Runtime Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/v1.2.1/spec.md).",

Its perfectly normal for them to stop when they find one such example: you didn't respect their time by vetting your code well, so why would you expect them to do the same for you? 'Ad nauseum' would point to a you problem, not a them problem.\n\nIf they're important, but not critical you can ask them to defer their requested change in a follow-up ticket/PR/MR, whatever is appropriate for your organization. This is a judgement call on how important the issue is and they may disagree with you and how that gets handled is a different issue.\n\nTheres also the notion of Work In Progress \\[WIP\\] reviews that some organizations use. These can circumvent CI systems since they cant/wont/shouldnt be merged and can help get feedback early and often. I always encourage juniors/new hires to do this; its lower stakes and gets ppl up to speed faster, IMHO.\n\nNow, if they're nitpicking \"bugs\" that don't matter or are just otherwise blocking merge on a single style nitpick or somesuch without completing the review thats another story: those can and should be grouped. Similar for minor bugs. If your organization is forcing you to move too quickly to do your due diligence to meet your team's standards, thats a different problem.\n\n\\> Do you speak to colleagues that do reviews this way and try to change their approach?\n\nThis is another organizational problem. More something to mention to a lead/manager/etc than something to confront on an individual level. The team should be relatively aligned on the workflow and top-down is usually going to be a more effective resolution. This is especially true the more junior you are: you may not have these experience to know that its an issue with your work.",

Clearly they didn't read the requirements or read the documentation or didn't test their code well enough. They need to spend more time on it.\n\n2. In fixing the first bug they could easily introduce more. I'm not going to give them a \"comprehensive\" list of bugs when the code's going to be changed anyways.\n\nI'm not saying it never happens. Of course bugs get caught in code review, and that's great.\n\nBut in an ideal scenario that shouldn't happen most of the time. Most of the time, the code should be good quality and well-tested already, and the purpose of the code review should be to make sure it's readable and clear.\n\nNow, if by \"bug\" you mean that the reviewer is complaining about tiny things like an accidental log line left in, or a typo in a comment, or a single line in isolation that could be written better, then that's different. Those are easily actionable quick fixes and they should approve the PR as long as those issues are fixed.",

Usually - especially if you’re the only non Indian - they don’t even realize there’s an issue. I’ve had to do this a couple times in the past and ask them to stick with English and annunciate a bit clearer and they did make a concerted effort which helped a ton. Just be polite and have a tone like a request for help rather than an accusation and you should be ok. \n\nStuff that can be jarring for native English speakers vs Indian English - \n\n- pauses at weird points mid sentence and sometimes multiple times per sentence\n\n- rising tones like asking a question but during a statement or other part of a sentence\n\n- dropped words (your brain will autocomplete the sentence anyway once you get used to whoever you’re working with) \n\n- certain phrases (do the needful being one of the most infamous) and words (definitely, certainly, surely, etc pop up frequently) that you will soon realize are far more vague than they imply. For example the “definitely” does not mean definitely, it can often be said as a “yeah yeah whatever” vibe\n\n- sometimes questions are phrased more like demands, but just know that usually it’s still a request and no offense is intended.

You have all the power in negotation and the market will dictate how much you make. So there is probably some give or take as to why newer people are making more off the bat. \n\nBut other than that this company sucks.

Where, when, and how they work is not necessarily up to you. \n\nIf you dictate they next come to your office, at x time, to do y work, they are likely going to be classified as an employee.\n\nIn this case, it sounds like OP is an employee for a company, and his employer has a contract to do work. An employee has to do what the employer requires, or the employer is free to fire them. Writing that a job is remote can trigger some legal protections for how much notice they must give you to change your work location, but any employer can change your work location as long as the proper notice period is given. That depends on the state, but it's usually pretty short anyway.",

On the other hand, all of my immediate team members are in another state, and although I do work with other teams in my local office, the collaboration benefit is miniscule. It's easier to just screen share in a meeting or send a screenshot, and we use slack, jira, and email for just about everything even when people are 20 feet away.  \n\nTo make it worse, enforced 8hrs/day so I leave during rush hour and get home 11-12 hours after I left. I'm not very productive in the office anymore, and a grumpy dad when I get home.

I would drop my kids off at school at around 8:20 am, got to the office around 9:30 am, then left around 6-7 pm, home by 7-8 pm. We were lucky we had in laws that were helping us daily - would have never worked out otherwise. The commute was tiring. I got less work done in the office given all the social distractions. When I got home, there was only enough time to briefly hang out with my kids, have my dinner, clean up, sleep at around 9-10 pm.\n\nWe have since moved to the suburbs during Covid. I am fully remote and don't have to commute at all. Waking up at the same time (around 6:30 am), I am able to get through morning chores done - and still have time to catch up on Slack/email all before the kids get up and ready to head to school. While we don't have my in-laws to help as much, I am able to pick my kids up at 5:30, have dinner with them, enjoy some time with them, get everyone ready for bedtime. If I need to catch up with work after bedtime, I am not a dead log yet because I had no exhausting commute - and I am able to power through another 1-2 hours, if necessary.\n\nI am indeed more productive from home - and I do feel like I actually work longer - but at the same time, I am less exhausted and less resentful. Feels like a win-win for employee and employer, so I have no idea why other companies are forcing RTO.",

Hardly anyone will tell you this, because it's likely you don't have anyone close enough in your life that you wouldn't immediately push away, if they pressed you to pursue getting help. That is a sign of the problem, in addition to spending several years and not actually getting software dev experience, which speaks to fundamental motivation. (It is worth asking the question: you've done some of it, do you enjoy doing it at all?)\n\nGet signed up for whatever affordable coverage you can and go find a therapist that has a background in depression, addiction, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT.\n\nIf you really don't know where to start, go to a Gambling Addictions Anonymous meeting. You don't have to buy into it all the way. It will give you a place to say your piece, as well as talk to people who have gone through similar things, de-stigmatizing the shame.\n\nPeople are saying quit trading and gambling. You should, but I am going to tell you that is a *symptom* of the cause, because waiting years to try and get a job after getting a degree, or not applying yourself to available skill learning resources (you literally have to not look for them) indicates that your problems lies in fundamental motivation, and is likely co-incident with other mental illness. \n\nYou need to fix that first, or at least find a sustainable coping strategy or short term medication assistance, because everything you've described (switching from what sounds like hardcore imposter syndrome pivoting to high risk, low reward strategies as the first shift you've described) points to the problem not being your ability to learn, but in fact, something emotional you're not dealing with that is impairing your ability to deal with your problems, which are not compounding (and not just like the interest on debt).\n\nThis stuff is worth figuring out and you are not hopeless, you're just mostly avoiding doing this, because I highly doubt I am the first person to say this to you, but in case I am. Stop reading this, and go do that immediately. \n\nCan't do it right now? Write it on a note and put it on your bathroom mirror or refrigerator. Somewhere you can't ignore. Just do what it takes to deal with this. If you actually do nothing about it, nobody will care about your suffering. Why do I say this? Because everything I have seen you write indicates an immaturity in dealing with the consequences of your own actions. You need to own that first, and you need to help yourself. Because you have created problems that will take years to solve, and you have to be the one to do it. The upside is you will feel better when you actually start doing working on it.

Wanna pair up today and see if I can be any help?\" goes a long way.\n\nSometimes the answer to \"how's it going\" might be \"Oh I already fixed it I think, I was just working on figuring out how to test / add unit tests / open a PR / etc\". Really this is stuff that should be coming out in standup so you can reach out before it's been a full 4 days when you notice they're not making any progress... but it sounds like yall either aren't doing standup or this dev isn't providing accurate updates.\n\nAs others have said this stuff was easier in the office. For whatever reason there's a tougher barrier to break to send someone a DM, as opposed to just casually walking past their cubicle and asking \"How's it going?\".",

The first problems I generally give to people when they join a project is ones that we have groomed and laid out the solution for them, and I expect them to learn more by getting into the codebase and testing the effects before and after. It takes awhile for someone to actually be able to find and solve problems when they are just getting into a code base.",

        "body": "I never went to a school as good as Berkeley and I'm not saying this is necessarily your problem since I don't know the full context, but from what I can tell -- there are some signs of my early mistakes so I'll elaborate in case it helps you out.\n\nLooking back at my early start -- the one trap that I fell into was having the \"smart kid\" syndrome. I would always compare other people's lows to my highs and was always surprised at the end result. That being, they ended up much further than I did at the end no matter how well they did e.g. GPA/knowledgeable they were about coding etc.\n\nIn hindsight, my mentality contributed to two major detriments in my first job search:\n\n1 -- I unknowingly built a moat around myself and classmates who could've been a resource, ended up becoming competition or inaccessible instead. In your story, it sounds like you have plenty of classmates who got into F500 or FAANG, yet it sounds like you never reached out for help or built enough connections to avoid applying 400/600 times per cycle. Assuming you carry the same mindset of reducing a company to traits like “in the middle of nowhere,\" you might fall into the same trap of I did in evaluating everyone in a new environment as beneath you and not building the correct connections, or at least practicing, to get to where you want to go.\n\nOne of my early jobs was in a small private company that I've never heard anyone mention in this sub in a random state in the South. From my time there, I knew a few data scientists and engineers who ended up going to great companies 2-3 years after their tenure to places such as LinkedIn, Meta, Paramount, etc. Had I went in with the same energy as I did in college, I would've never made friends and been able to reach out to them for help when it came to career advice or referrals. Instead of coming in with the expectation of getting something out of every interaction, I just became the person people want to work with -- be there for when they need help or talk about the project or life in general. All the \"small talk\" that you think is a waste of time makes you personable and they'll remember you when time comes.\n\n2 -- That mentality carries over into how you present yourself as a person and affects you in ways you probably didn't notice before. For me, it caused mismatched expectations and actually set me back from learning to my fullest potential. I always told myself that I should've gotten a better offer or shouldn't have struggled for as long as I did due to my capabilities; my worldview was shattered over and over again, once someone I deemed \"dumber\" got a more coveted position or had breezed through their job search. And this mentality doesn't really stop, there's always someone luckier or someone better than you in some way, that got an opportunity that you wanted and it looms in the back of your mind on every task that you do. I don't have much advice here aside from realization; getting hit with reality and coming to terms with having weaknesses in certain areas or unlucky in others actually helped me become open to learning a ton and that honest acceptance of my capabilities and circumstance got me more opportunities and help from others than I had gotten previously.\n\nInadvertently this also helped in interviews and building connections, at least at the entry level as no interviewer or coworker wants to work with a new grad/mid-level with a pompous or fake persona even if they do mostly know their stuff. At the end of the day, we all want is someone human to work with and one of the most human traits you can exhibit in an interview is that you make mistakes, can learn and are competent/graceful enough to pivot with a team to come to a solution.",

And yet, every single one who left (or got pipped) does not regret joining Amazon even for a second. The things you can learn, the network you can create, the doors that it can open for you... there are lots of benefits there if you try your hardest.\n\nLike I said, I have 4 years at an insurance company. It's been fantastic from a work life balance perspective. I've made lifelong friends, have a great network, and have really had the opportunity for 4 years of peace. The downside? I haven't learned as much as other folks who joined companies that were a bit higher pressure. So there's pros and cons there.\n\nI'm now at a place where I'm just... bored with my current job. So I'm currently doing the good ol' interview prep and planning on applying to Amazon (among others) as well.\n\nI would really urge you to take the offer. You're young, it won't matter too much if you get laid off. It will open doors for you and (hopefully) you'll be able to learn at a much faster pace than your current gig.\n\nIf you look at Amazon as a stepping stone, and not a future home, you'll be in a much better place psychologically to handle the work environment.\n\nGo for it!!!",

This is a biggie, because it's not uncommon for Amazon to hire people in one location and then tell them to move in 60-90 days or lose their job.\n* What's the ops load like?\n* What is the make-up of their team? How many L4's has your manager promoted? Are there opportunities for growth up to L6?\n* Where is your office? Is it Seattle or Bellevue? What's the rent situation like, and is Seattle somewhere you want to live for years? Transfers are tricky at Amazon since 2022, so you'd be waiting a while for L5 before you can transfer - and even then you'll be up against hundreds of others.\n* Do you want to join in what is essentially a new grad role, or would you prefer to wait and join as a new L5 in a few years? Amazon has started downlevelling people lately, and it really fucks with URA as you have some L4's with years of experience making newer engineers look bad (and eventually up for the chop). The \"hire to fire\" culture is also still there in some teams.\n\nMost importantly, if you choose to join Amazon you should have a contingency plan in place in case you end up in Focus/Pivot. Speak to your current boss and see what their boomerang policy is. If you can bounce back in a year, great! If two, even better! There's little to lose.\n\nAt face value, I would say that joining as an \"experienced\" L4 isn't a great idea, unless you're going to drastically improve your income by joining Amazon. Even then, layoffs are still occurring, and PIP is always looming, so you might not even see that salary. If despite all the warnings you're still sold, absolutely go for it. It *can* be a good place to work if you're really lucky, and you find a team that's both good, does interesting work, and has a manager that's invested in your growth - while also great at fighting your corner to help you stay above the dreaded URA curve.",

To be honest it was 3 years of alot of high expectations, micromanaging, a silent agreement to always be available and being compared to what teammates were doing even if you were technically meeting expectations of the position. \n\n\nExpect meetings on mettings on meetings and any cool design or Pr you put out, expect people to hold it back because they want to discuss why you used a for loop over a while loop. \n\nIt will either make you or break you. Looking back, i dont regret being there as i got it out of my system and it showed me the grass isnt always greener. For the money i dont really regret it as i used that money to do bigger things. My mental healthy didnt deteriorate but it also didnt improve with the added stress. \n\nI lost my job in january and even though i hated being jobless i didnt miss it at all and i was able to get a new job within 3 months. \n\nIf you think you can manage a few years of stressful work, little WLB, and the expectation you will always be available then i say go for it. \n\nThere are alot of upsides that go with the downsides and now that im past working in faang im glad i got to milk it but id never do that again.",

        "body": "Do you know what team? This matters a lot. I'm assuming, since you're being hired at SDE I with < 1 YOE, that you'll get assigned to a random team like all New Grads do. Technically, you still qualify as a \"New Grad\".\n\nWhether this is the case or not, hear me out, you should take the Amazon offer, but keep your F500 job for the first month while you figure out if Amazon is the right place for you.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. It is actually difficult to switch teams at Amazon. You will have to do a full loop and they may ask you for meaningful code reviews that you've authored. If you haven't been on the team for long OR if it's too ops heavy OR if there's just not enough scope, then HMs may not be interested in you.\n2. You might be a hire to fire. If you're put on focus, then you can't switch teams.\n3. Your manager/team/org might suck. If your manager isn't keen on your growth, then you won't get the scope to grow to the next level. You may also face issues if your team isn't balanced levels wise (e.g., no L6s or 0-2 L5s -> overworked L4s). EnderMB's comment is golden, esp \"What is the make-up of their team? How many L4's has your manager promoted? Are there opportunities for growth up to L6?\"\n4. You might hate the work your team is doing (esp if you're randomly placed). You could be a frontend wiz, but get placed on a team working on compilers. Or your team might be a KTLO team where all you're doing is ops and bug fixes (zero feature work).\n\nTake PTO or a leave of absence from your F500 job, scope out Amazon, and then make your decision. Best Case: you're a great fit for your role at Amazon and you're happy. Worst Case: you have to leave Amazon and go back to your fully remote job.\n\nFWIW: I worked at Amazon as a new grad SDE I and fell into a team of no L6s, only 1 L5, and rest L4s. I had to put in over \\~70 hrs per week to keep up with expectations. I burned out in 1 year and quit without having anything lined up. Luckily, the market was fire back then so I was able to take a few months off and get a job elsewhere.\n\nAmazon on your resume will open a lot of doors, but tread carefully.",

However, many companies outright imploded then. There were a lot of companies making no money, with financially non-viable businesses, whose stock value was based entirely on hype. Companies like Tesla today that are very hype driven still bring in billions of dollars of revenue each year. A lot of people genuinely believed the internet was a failed fad, that software was, at best, a boring thing banks used that had no growth potential.\n\nSince then, the industry has grown in size tremendously. In absolute numbers, more people are impacted by layoffs today. But businesses are not folding left and right like back then. The job market is slow. There have been many layoffs, but there are still millions employed in the industry. Pay is still higher relative to other jobs than it was back then. There's certainly no sense that the internet was a fad, or tech is going away entirely.",

Consider the fact that, on Stalin’s birthday, prisoners would send him congratulatory telegrams from the darkest gulags: it isn’t possible to imagine a Jew in Auschwitz sending Hitler such a telegram. \n\n> It is a tasteless distinction, but it supports the contention that under Stalin, the ruling ideology presupposed a space in which the leader and his subjects could meet as servants of Historical Reason. Under Stalin, all people were, theoretically, equal.\n\n...\n\n> But why a master at all? The other way to deal with the decline of traditional authority is the anarchist way, and anarchism is having a revival today, from Noam Chomsky to David Graeber. Anarchism \r\nis not against public power—Catherine Malabou, another neo-anarchist, refers to Jacques Rancière, who asserts “radical equality between citizens who are considered able to both command and \r\nobey.” (Catherine Malabou’s words in: Malabou and Balibar 2022, p. 179) There is an essential relationship between the lot and democratic expression: there is public power, but “true democracy would rely on the contingency of who governs and who is governed because governing does not require any particular skill.” (Ibid.)\n\n...\n\n> Consequently, a paradox I argue for is that false opposition is to be left behind: we do not overcome alienation by disalienation, we do not overcome the master by eliminating it, and we do not overcome public power by limiting it to useful public services.\\\nThe non-alienated autonomous liberal individual is itself a product of alienation in capitalist society; a master effectively serving the people, taking care of them, is a fetish created to prevent the possibility that individuals will themselves take care of themselves; the idea of power serving society justifies power and thus obfuscates its constitutive excess.",

There are exceptions, but knowing your stuff will often get you to a sensible result faster in the scope of the interview. You need to be able to coherently explain and reason about your code, why you're taking one approach instead of another. Using AI in an interview doesn't pair well with this. It also gives me less signal as an interviewer.\n\nAll this to say, when you're ready to start your job search, you should be doubling down on fundamentals, Leetcode and upskilling on things like React/whatever framework you're rusty with. Using AI on the job is one thing, but imo you should be focused on fundamentals and interview prep in the short term.\n\nOnce you have a job, then worry about how you'll use AI to work faster and better.",

They're the responsibility of management.\n\nWe're IC's, we're responsible for doing the best work we can during our 40 hour work week. It doesn't matter if we get assigned 20 peoples-worth of responsibility. All that means is we will work to prioritize, and accurately communicate progress and ***timelines*** (independent of \"deadlines\") spread across 1 persons-worth of work weeks. That's how the exchange of labor works. Don't scale your hours.\n\nManagement has tools in their toolbelt to account for at-risk deadlines. It's literally project management 101, shit interns learn, shit that's like on page 1 of any sort of guide to PM. They can dial back scope, they can hire more resources, or they can push back the deadline.\n\nForcing their resources to work more than 40 hours isn't a (healthy) option. But if the SWE's *let them*, they'd be crazy to not take advantage of it. So don't let them. Work your 40 hours. Communicate everything based on those 40 hours. \"We need it done by X\" doesn't matter, because based on your 40 hour work week your job is to communicate the *realistic* estimate. \"Ok... well if I drop A, B, C, D, E, and F, I can get G done by X\", or \"If we take an MVP approach and get rid of H, I, J,  and K requirements we can get the MVP done by X\".\n\nEverything you're describing is a failure of management, not of you. Deadlines, staffing, prioritization, scope, etc. It's all in *their* job description. Will your management like you establishing and sticking to your professional boundaries?\n\nProbably not. But you know what their options are? Fire you, and set their timeline back by *bare minimum* another 6-12 months across the board (probably more). Does that sound like a smart option? Call their bluff.\n\nPut in your 40, be realistic, be communicative, don't fall victim to \"deadlines\", and if your management ignores your very reasonable professional boundaries, start looking for another job. The market being bad doesn't change any of this.",

Ex. if you make $80,000 and want to make $100,000 tell them you want to make $100,000 to $160,000 (arbitrary ceiling chosen but give yourself a nice range) rather than you make $80,000. I don't think it's unreasonable to give SOME number, if your number is TOO low then it's possible you should have bolstered your position by understanding the market better (to be fair, sometimes difficult to do).\n\nHowever third-party recruiters don't just have the incentive to match you to multiple companies, they have the incentive to match you ASAP. That means if they're going to companies, they may be getting the cheapest offer just to line you up with a few offers and have you choose (if you are presented with 3 offers ranging from $85k to $95k it may also give the impression that is all companies in your area are willing to pay and cause you to commit early). This isn't always the case, but if you get a lazy recruiter, this is more likely.\n\nIf you give them a target, they will more likely hunt against that target, in which case you're aligning their goals (getting you matched) with your goal (getting you matched at your target) which I think saves everyone some time in the long run (companies for whom you are out of their league won't bother, companies who are willing to pay more may be more inclined to be more competitive).\n\nHope that provides some clarity.\n\nEDIT: I also generally don't like advice to never give a number, I think that's just lazy on the part of the candidate and can be wasteful of the time of the recruiter if they're following leads you would already know are not worth your time. Knowing approximately where you stand saves everyone time and makes you better positioned in the hunt.",

Frontend interviews (not that I've attended many of them) also seem to focus mostly on whether you understand `#selector` or what a particular React or JS construct does, and very little on how to communicate with the backend team on APIs you need.\n\n\nI guess my point is, if you're pure frontend, you're both viewing the world (and being viewed in) a similar light. If you can do some backend, at least, you're much better positioned to talk about how the data gets to the FE. That seems to be called a \"Full stack with FE lean\" in job descriptions these days.\n\n\nThat it pays more IMO reflects this aspect of the full stack role. It's worth being able to work on the backend at least a bit, so my recommendation would to be to get into the FS role.

Even so, a masters is just so many hours, it's probably much more than you'd be doing by yourself through some sort of self-paced program.\n\nI did OMSCS, and already had graduate experience in bioinformatics, so I wasn't looking to get involved in research. There were a few benefits to the program: exposing me to a lot of topics that helped me be a better backend engineer, like distributed system and more low level stuff, solidifying my ML knowledge (started the program as a working data scientist), and probably most importantly, giving me the credential so I could apply (and eventually get into) big tech companies.\n\nOMSCS is also pretty brutal: your hobby, night and weekends for 2+ years, will be doing CS projects and writing papers. That stuff makes you a better engineer through sheer hours on task, but there are also other ways to improve.",

IOW, maybe the people do have interest in the subject, but what they really want is to show they have a degree. Really for working professionals like yourself. \n\nDue to it being asynchronous, it’s simply not going to have the same rigor as an on campus program. Example: exam is proctored online and must be done within 24 hours. Why not have teams of students where one goes first and feeds the questions to everyone else? This is obviously not a concern in a synchronous exam. I know for my online masters program, there’s a huge de-emphasis on testing, and I suspect it’s because it’s impossible to police. Instead, it’s a lot of research papers and deep dives, which can obviously be useful, but can also be a constant exercise in simply going back through course material to find the relevant topic and answering. Thus far, I’m about to finish course 6 and 7 of 13 (prerequisites included) and I’m tracking to be sitting at a 3.9 minimum, and I’ve been slack on readings. \n\nBalance, it can be hard. You should probably expect to spend at least 9 hours per class per week. Obviously you can try to coast and do the bare minimum, but then why would you pay for that?\n\nI’d look towards certifications after the masters degree. That’s a logical step to take as you get more senior, and need more differentiation to land those prestigious jobs.",

It’s important to recognize that the quant job market is significantly different than just SWE/tech job market in some key ways. Culture, working hours, stress, and sustainability of your career should be considerations. Can you handle joining an investment firm then getting the axe a year or two later? Can you handle one or two years of garden leave due to non-competes? Can you handle being restricted by non-disclosure agreement?\n\nAnywho, I know Wells Fargo and PIMCO is huge out west. All the regular developers I know who work on securities pricing, risk reporting, trading systems, or otherwise more business-activity related platforms seem pretty secure in their jobs, if overworked. Although the American banks, at least, love a good layoff (eyes on you Goldman). IMO it’s great having a $$$ cash bonus at the end of every year while not being on the front line for layoffs relatively (suck it bankers, quants, researchers, and sales traders!). \n\nMaybe it’d be easier to skill build and lateral into a business-related developer role (ex. Java Algo Dev, E-Trading Dev, Low-Latency Trading Systems Dev, etc) than get a grad degree just to work on capital markets technology again?\n\nDefinitely get in touch with recruiters and headhunters. See McGregor-Boyall or Stanford Black to name a few. Network on LinkedIn with these agencies or consultancies and interview grind yourself into a new job.",

Instead of stressing about interviews that don't happen, pour more energy into getting better at LeetCode and practicing behavioral questions with a friend or family member. It'll make you feel more prepared when (not if) you do land an interview.\n\nOne thing that helped me when I was in a similar spot was using this AI tool that listens to the interview and suggests responses in real time. If you're interested, I can share it with you. Just remember that you got this!

        "body": "I'd just say this -- it's easy to think that the entire world goes through you staying at your current company, but you actually have options. Software isn't a game we play for a day and can take big injuries, but a game we play week after week for years. For you, it doesn't sound like you are in a sustainable work environment -- you'll ever suffer some major health consequences then lose your job, or lose your job a little bit sooner and be back home.\n\nTherefore, I'd figure out what you need from your work to start getting on top of your health: maybe that's medical leave, or it could be an accommodation like more WFH. Then, tell HR what you need, with the right documentation, and let them decide. They don't really need to know the details of your condition, just that you are asking for certain things that are medically required. You might a little screwed right now, but if you lose a finger (or more), you'll be dealing with that consequence for the rest of your career.\n\nYou're already on your way out of the company: that's what it means when your manager is forced to PIP you, it's a pretext for planned turnover, and it's very likely that no matter what you do, the manager will be forced to make another decision they might not agree with, since this is already going on at the company. I'd weight that pretty heavily in planning on what to do next.\n\nAlso, you gave a small tell that your performance probably isn't as good as is expected or you might be misreading the situation: \"This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager\". This complaint is common in a few people I've had to coach for not meeting expecations, and it's difficult for them to understand that praise of a single task, or doing one thing well, doesn't equate to broadly meeting expectations. IMO, it says there's a blind spot in your understanding of where you fit into the workplace, and therefore I'd encourage you to sit down 1v1 with the lead and get their opinion on whether or not you're on track, or what else you could do.",

Two examples:\n\n* The screens would load stuff like Account data every time they interacted with it\n    * I built an Identity package that would authenticate and then fetch all of the user data, so it would always be available and up-to-date everywhere\n    * I've added shims to all older code, that would simply return the right data from Identity rather than re-fetching, so I had a single source of truth without doing a full re-write\n    * Then we ran an experiment to see if there were any issues\n    * That was successful and we started to remove the old code\n    * All new features are much easier to build already as they are now oblivious to the tech debt elsewhere\n* Navigation was a mess, wrongly structured and highly incidental code to make things work\n    * Did an investigation of how ideal (SwiftUI-only) navigation would work\n    * Then we would try to see how that would apply to our existing UIKit based navigation\n    * We drew an API that would support both the current as well as the ideal future navigation stack\n    * All navigation moved into this not very optimal yet but well-abstracted navigator\n    * Now we started to swap around the wrongly architected parts in navigation without touching any of th screens, since it's well abstracted\n    * In a few months we'll probably switch to SwiftUI based navigation, without impacting the app much\n\nYou should always figure out what is the issue, how do you solve it, and what steps should you plan so you have a controllable level of risk at every step.\n\nTry to have a well structured plan and propose that to the people that overrule your lead, instead of relying on ad-hoc interventions. You could also propose patterns and practices like SOLID and unit testing.",

This is hard and many are not cut for it, preferring to create plans to burn it all down for something new. \n\nLastly, I hate to say, but just wanting to be a mundane ticket taker is neither good or fun for you long term. You should develop opinions and strategies for how to make things better. This field is getting more competitive and saturated and if you can’t put out more than the exact minimum effort to not get fired, you are going to be left behind in this field eventually.",

I didnt feel like for the money i was improving myself and this was also during covid where remote work was getting popular and due to the company industry i couldnt work remote. \n\nI made good amount of money after that but i was very overworked in my next company and got fired after 3 years for low performance (but they had insanely high expectations). I dont regret leaving as i made enough money to buy a house. I started a new job for more pay and so far work life balance seems really good. I dont see anybody really post messages past  EOD where in my last job i would see messages sent all day.\n\nIf you dont like your job, it’s ok to leave. Be smart and respectful about it but also id advise chasing the money. The money will come in this industry, i chased the money and had 3 really stressful years of work.

They want you committed for life but will dump you in a heartbeat. To that end several short full time role is often a red flag, but 2 years is plenty in your case. If you can find something more exciting, challenging, interesting, lucrative - why not? You might change the path of your career or life. ",

Cert won't get any jobs but has a small chance of getting you to the interview stage and helping you with a design problem. Master's in Data Science is a worthless degree. A Master's in CS is useless except either **a)** you can land a paid internship and co-op in CS to reset yourself **b)** reset a long work gap where you feel recruiters are discriminating **c)** you don't actually learn CS with the CS degree or work experience\n\nDoing QA work and deployments, it's more or less a dying job for Americans and has been so for years. Why Cognizant does it, was POS IBM where I was. Newer trend is make the developers do the tester job as well for the same pay. All of a sudden I was coding and deploying my own code with responsibility for all levels of testing. Violates segregation of duty and forces me on 45-50 hours weeks but saves the man money.\n\nIf you still want to go this route and build on your work experience, yeah the cert is probably okay and degree probably works the same way in that it's a calculated risk. Less a risk if the degree is fully funded. You can do Multivariate Calculus. The shock value ended in Calc II. Nice part is taking the derivative of one variable, you treat the other variable as a constant and it doesn't matter what order you take derivatives in.",

So my intent in pursuing these is just for learning something fruitful, then I can hopefully build my own projects to show some competency on my own.\n\nI hear what you're saying about the Data Science Master's, it isn't much on its own and actual experience matters. But I can't get a job without experience, and I can't get experience without a job, as the saying goes, so that's why I considered this. Rutgers also offers a Master's in Business and Science which combines data analytics and business courses, but having to fund it myself, fully or partially, I dunno I just don't want to bother with school again, now that I think about it more. Also for calculus, I haven't touched it in well over 5 years, neither at work nor school, basically forgot everything, so that's why I am so hesitant about that part.\n\nCompanies expecting people to be a jack-of-all-trades just so they can save money is an irritating trend. If I were a greedy CEO I'd probably understand, but as someone who just wants enough of a salary to live comfortably, it gets on my nerves. But that's how this field is, the ones who are willing to adapt in the race to the bottom will succeed.\n\nI'll stick with the self-learning path then, for now. It's the most doable at this point.",

No question is stupid, so ask lots of them. There are instances when users are unclear about their needs, requirements are imprecise, the one-line JIRA description is deceptive, and so on. Everyone expects you to give estimates right away, but we need to stop and gather information before moving on to the solution.\nOnce you know what you need to do clearly you can build it pretty easily.\n\nAnother thing that I can think of is documenting your work. Either we do not follow it enough or they do not teach it to us in academy. Documentation benefits both you and your replacement. Sometimes you return to your code and have to spend time just remembering and understanding what you wrote.",

I always said if I found a job that really has impact like that then I'd actually be happy going into work. Something to benefit animals and people less fortunate, something that'd be beneficial to the environment.\n\nMaterial Science, Chemical Engineering, Physics, Math, etc. are all going to be about finding the big breakthroughs with hands on in the real world looking for discoveries and leveraging phenomena to build things.\n\nThen of course, the medical field.\n\nA big roadblock though is that so much that stands in the way of progress is nothing even technical, it's political. Shitty policies. We have insane technology today that people 200 years ago would never have dreamed of and I'm sure many of them would be shaking their heads at what we're pointing it to instead. There are simply way too many dishonest and self-centered people. Too many selfish people not thinking about people less fortunate, animals, the environment, etc. is why we're in this mess and in many cases, going backwards.\n\nThat said for Comp Sci I'd say most likely C and C++ mainly for Embedded with potentially Rust and Zig  and there's Python for A.I. Hate to be yet another \"A.I\" person and sound like I'm shilling, but the reality is the tech is going to be a big game changer, even more than it is now imo. We simply don't know when, if we'll ever get it to that level of A.G.I, but even if we don't get there this will help lead to many breakthroughs along the way. NVIDIA recently cracked the genome. Their A.I is actually able to build lifeforms with unique features/genetics and traits. Stuff like that is a gamechanger and that's what A.I brings.",

Data in PE can be useful, sure, but they already know how to use excel, there isn't \"big\" data to crunch in PE, the team is small... and whatever full stack stuff you're working on is likely to be internal tools. Schwab might be similar, but more people will be using the tools, you'll get more mentorship, you won't deal with the sometimes capricious bullshit that comes with working for a small company (especially run by finance guys), and if you don't like your job at Schwab, well, at least you'll have the rest of your life to fall back on.",
