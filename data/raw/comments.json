It says that everything in the table should be about the *whole* key, not just a piece of it.\n\n*   **Rule:** Be in 1NF and have no partial dependencies. This means that all the information in a row must depend on the entire primary key.\n*   **Example:** Imagine a table for pizza orders. The key is the `Customer` and the `Pizza Type`.\n\n**Messy (Not 2NF):**\n\n    | Customer | Pizza Type | Customer's Favorite Topping |\n    | :------- | :--------- | :-------------------------- |\n    | Sam      | Pepperoni  | Olives                      |\n    | Mia      | Cheese     | Pineapple                   |\n    | Sam      | Veggie     | Olives                      |\n\nThe problem here is that the \"Favorite Topping\" is only about the `Customer`, not what kind of pizza they ordered that day. To fix this, we can split the table into two:\n\n**Organized (2NF):**\n\n**Orders Table:**\n\n    | Customer | Pizza Type |\n    | :------- | :--------- |\n    | Sam      | Pepperoni  |\n    | Mia      | Cheese     |\n    | Sam      | Veggie     |\n\n**Customers Table:**\n\n    | Customer | Favorite Topping |\n    | :------- | :--------------- |\n    | Sam      | Olives           |\n    | Mia      | Pineapple        |\n\nNow, the \"Favorite Topping\" is in a table all about the customers.\n\n### **Third Normal Form (3NF): No Secret Information Hiding**\n\nThis is about making sure that the information in your table is only about the main topic (the key) and not about other things in the same table.\n\n*   **Rule:** Be in 2NF and have no transitive dependencies (in other words, each cell on the row should *only* depend on the key, not on other cells)\n*   **Example:** Let's look at a table about your favorite Disney characters.\n\n**Messy (Not 3NF):**\n\n    | Character         | Movie               | Movie's Director |\n    | :---------------- | :------------------ | :--------------- |\n    | Buzz Lightyear    | Toy Story           | John Lasseter    |\n    | Woody             | Toy Story           | John Lasseter    |\n    | Elsa              | Frozen              | Chris Buck       |\n\nHere, the \"Movie's Director\" is really about the `Movie`, not the `Character`. If the director changes, you'd have to update it for every character in that movie. So, we split it up:\n\n**Organized (3NF):**\n\n**Characters Table:**\n\n    | Character         | Movie       |\n    | :---------------- | :---------- |\n    | Buzz Lightyear    | Toy Story   |\n    | Woody             | Toy Story   |\n    | Elsa              | Frozen      |\n\n**Movies Table:**\n\n    | Movie     | Director      |\n    | :-------- | :------------ |\n    | Toy Story | John Lasseter |\n    | Frozen    | Chris Buck    |\n\nNow, the director is in the \"Movies\" table, which makes more sense.",

Same with the doctor. Every time the doctor sees a patient, if you store all the data about the doctor, you're storing their name every time. In addition to being very inefficient from a space perspective, it's harder to modify data later. Let's assume the doctor changes their name. Now you have to go back and update the doctor's name at every instance it was recorded in the database. \n\nInstead if you normalize the data, you have one record in a patient table to represent a patient, and one record in a doctor table to represent the doctor. Then you just give each record an ID and \"point\" to those records when you want to reference them from somewhere else in the database. It also has the benefit of conceptually distinguishing the different entities in the universe of data.",

This is a general rule of thumb but it is not necessarily worth it to fully normalize source data before bringing it into analytical workloads just nicer when it's already done for you.",

You'd have to change multiple rows of multiple tables. What if another dev made a take that stored user data like that that you didn't know about? You'd have inconsistent data.\n\nf you keep the orders with a reference to the user table, you'd only have to change one field in one table and the references wouldn't have to be changed. \n\nYour data would stay consistent with database changes and record updates",

It seems to me that Spark features in \"big\" (for a varying definition of \"big\") projects and platforms a lot. Polars seems to feature in smaller projects and platforms a lot. Postgres seems to feature in older, more RDBMS-driven architectures a lot too. But this isn't a stack, just \"some things I've seen\".\n\nI am not experienced enough to *really* say, but I can propose a \"hot-take\" theory of why this is. I am not myself very confident in this, again. But the argument goes like this:\n\nA standard stack in our industry will not be possible without a standard stack in web/backend. Fundamentally, data is a byproduct of a company's main business at first. A company may become \"data mature\" or \"data driven\" by converting this byproduct into a core loop of the business, in fact even its moat, but no one starts a company with \"data driven\". When you're starting a company, you can build software that will become your moat, but you can't \"build data\". In effect, I think by the time a company starts even thinking about data engineers, it is already stuck with some existing and effectively immutable architectural components, and our systems must use tooling that plays nice with those. So until these upstream components become standardized (e.g. the SQL/noSQL war in OLTP land finishes definitively, REST is fully replaced by gRPC, etc) - our systems won't.",

If this starts to become the trend, then you‚Äôll no longer need to keep up with mastering what language or platform is the yearly favorite and focus more on implementing value - how to ensure AI assisted code generation is working successfully at your company.

If a company won‚Äôt hire you because you are not a 10 year expert on an acronym that was invented 2 months ago - then can you fit into a leadership/guidance position to enable ‚Äúhot swappable‚Äù developers? I point back to the other comment in this thread - do you know Kimball? Do you know business processes, business data, and how to mature raw data into actionable insights which can reduce cost and increase revenue? If the answer is yes, you will likely be ok. If the answer is if no - I just know SSIS and I really can‚Äôt do anything unless my team lead holds my hand - then I would set some goals for career development.",

Staging is for validating new changes prior to prod deployment, and is only used when we have a pipeline change on the way. We compare partitions generated from prod and staging, get sign off, and deploy. If something is critically wrong we can rollback, and backfill is usually an option if really needed.\n\nIn general, it helps having a model where your most upstream tables are permissive with regards to fields (e.g. avoiding white listing or overly strict schema assertions) and involve minimal/no transformations. Then any downstream changes can always be deployed and rerun against these without data loss, only cost is compute.¬†",

I would say that if you explicitly say that the data is \\*copied\\* from source systems to staging area to the warehouse then some things may become clear.\n\nFor example, the fact that you can copy the same data to multiple staging areas and multiple warehouses, from the same source system.  It's harder to think about that using the word \"move\".",

I managed a team doing the platform work in this case, and we did build some great stuff: a linter that would block PRs if the SQL was messy, really useful costing analysis comparing actuals to planned budget, etc, etc.  But it was a brutal fight to attempt to prevent the entire solution from collapsing under the weight of tech debt.  It would have been far easier to have actual engineers build the data pipelines.\n   * In most of the data engineering teams I'm on we also build the platform anyway: all the reusable code, libraries, extra tooling for deploying models, quality-control checks on the data, etc, etc.",

You can definitely learn to code in those but reviewing, refactoring, and optimizing takes a lot of on the job experience to do well. \n\nI suggest really diving into understanding the broader concepts behind modern data engineering and working on some projects in Python at the very least. Example: build an ETL pipeline to pull data from a public API, shape it, and write it to a database. Then build a simple dashboard for it",

I can tell you without a doubt I see Snowflake the most often in the tech stacks, by far. It‚Äôs super trendy. They have marketed themselves well and I‚Äôve had multiple meetings with execs at small and large businesses in my previous role and they all knew about Snowflake, which I found unusual.\n\nDatabricks would be the runner up but again my observation in the job market is those companies using databricks (or Apache Spark) have huge, huge datasets (think like Netflix level). Everyone else seems to be on dbt and Snowflake.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt bother with BigQuery, at least it‚Äôs not something I found much on my job search and I was pretty open on my search criteria.\n\nThe other route you could go is to pick one of these you might enjoy and then go on www.stackshare.io and find companies using that then target them for a job search. At the end of the day, you don‚Äôt live very long so pick something you will enjoy vs trend chasing but do you boo :-)",

My server is not really. Now I found it cheap and built it up slow. If you want a server similar tomorrow, you have to pay a significant premium, and it will be more expensive. But I can spin up what I need, and not really ever care about resources. Feels great, despite not being the newest hardware.\n\nBut the Pi's are also a great alternative. I do think that the newest is kind of expensive, so if you need several 8 GB memory, it *kind* of gets expensive enough to buy some actual stuff.",

While catalogs can bring in documentation from different sources, they often still need supplemental information to bring things together in a cohesive manner. Because of that, if your people won't maintain it, it doesn't matter. So make sure you have some of those user types in your discovery meetings, because too often I've seen them skipped and not able to provide feedback and the catalog turns into shelfware that does nothing but extract metadata from your systems.\n\nLike everyone else in the thread has said, open metadata is rather popular and can be self hosted. Alation can get really expensive as you tend to pay per connector IIRC. Atlan has a lot of integrations, but I don't recall if you can host it. I've also seen Collibra and Data.World come up, but I'm not really familiar with them. Good luck on the discovery!",

For me, Databricks is the poster child for this sort of nonsense.\n\nIf you want a really good acid test, see how any given tool solves an age-old problem that is still around today.: Import a fixed width format file. They are still incredibly common. Lots of vendors want to talk about JSON, Parquet, or XML; files with built in structure. See how they handled files with no or limited structure like fixed width or CSV. These are old formats so one would expect there to be a solution, but there isn't a good one yet. I always thought AI would be a good way to tease out the structure of a fixed width file, but it struggles to figure out where the columns begin and end.\n\nRight now, the majority of \"what's next\" is certified 100% rehashing of old ideas with a fresh coat of paint.",

A couple more angles from the Python side:\n\n* If your XML parsing logic is already in Python, you don‚Äôt *have* to switch over to Spark right away. Libraries like `lxml` or `xmltodict` scale pretty well if you can fan them out in parallel.\n* Dask is a nice middle ground since it lets you run the exact same parsing code across many cores/machines, then write out to Parquet in parallel. That way you can keep things Pythonic while still scaling to millions of files.\n* For cloud vs local: prototype on your laptop with Dask, then move the same workflow to the cloud when you hit limits. Tools like coiled make that spin-up pretty painless if you don‚Äôt want to manage the infra yourself. Worth noting coiled has other non-Dask APIs that might work well for scaling out arbitrary Python code (like their batch jobs api)\n\nSo I‚Äôd say: if your pipeline is mostly parsing Python ‚Üí Parquet, Dask can be lighter-weight than Spark. If you expect heavy SQL-style processing downstream, Spark/Databricks might make more sense.",

I see plenty of code based ETL orchastration (Dagster, Airflow etc) but less GUI options unless I'm missing something key. The issue I have there is that for bigger places, code based works fine, they can have dedicated DE teams but smaller businesses and onw man band operations definitely get a benefit from simpler to use GUI based tools. I know at one point this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.\n\nOne thing I'd suggest is trying to avoid a fixed requirement on docker containers or having a sprawl of dozens of individual components needing to run in tandem again for the smaller places/one man bands. They might not have capabilities to run Docker (IT blocking etc) and if the alternative is 15+ individual components all needing to be run at once then it'll be overwhelming.\n\nYour package avoids this currently so definitely worth sticking to that in my view. \n\nOutside of that some way to choose the destination DB engine would be good, Postgres is great and all but again smaller teams/OMBs might not get a choice and might be required to use MSSQL server or Oracle, or even just have a section within a larger warehouse like Teradata/Snowflake/Databricks that they get to use for operations. Don't think I saw anything for changing the write destination engine type so if I missed that then ignore me. \n\nGood work on it though!",

I can't think of any that are available that is GUI based and open source. \n\nGUI tools might be inefficient and not great at scale but the simplicity and ease of use for non-data professionals can be very helpful in a lot of business uses. Efficiency and scaling aren't that important when the data you work with is <500k rows per source per month but its worth having something to remove the manual task of loading 10+ datasets. Less worth it when things like Dagster take the process and complicate it to hell with lots of new concepts that mean nothing to a business user. And yeah a python script with pandas and sqlalchemy could do it but that's assuming that the team have a python dev. Lot of data teams are basically SQL and their BI tool of choice only. This is where a simple GUI tool shines. They know the data, they know how they need to get it and where to get it but the how might as well be magic currently but a GUI tool to pick, load to staging and then do a series of basic cleaning steps to get it ready and save that as a flow they can schedule allows them a lot more capability and lets them get a lot more value from their data.",

Recently I was told that he does allow me to use an smtp server to notify myself of failures. This is true and I only have one counter to it right now and that he doesn‚Äôt use the emails for the the packages he has  built in the past that my team relies on so often I am stuck trouble with stakeholders emailing me because he doesn‚Äôt let me know that something went wrong on his end. This brings my next point.\n\nBetter data practices. You could say that I could do this with SSIS and I could if I had the opportunity to but it‚Äôs not my environment and the dba will not let me try anything different in his environment. I want to standardize things like ci/cd and proper data pipeline monitoring as well as documentation.  From my point of view it seems easier to do so with a tool that aligns better with my skill set and the skill set of my team if I cannot change anything in SSIS environment. I mentioned in another comment that the dba didn‚Äôt go for implementing ci/cd in his environment.\n\nShorter product delivery times. This isn‚Äôt really because of ssis vs python. I could make an arguement like that but I know that that is subjective.  This is more about man power and ease of deployment.  There are more coders in my agency than gui developers and the business units are required to build their own data pipelines (dba words because he said that he doesn‚Äôt have enough staff who know ssis to support the business units. He only got two new people in the last few months and they aren‚Äôt trained.) from my point of view leaning into a coding based orchestration tool or a coding solution in general will alllow the business units to really build their own data pipelines efficiently and then IT and the dba can just manage production which is what he seems to want anyway. I guess I‚Äôm saying this will play to changing skillset of employees and allow the organization to develop faster as a whole instead of business units feeling frustrated by a slow IT.\n\n\nTechnical debt.  This one is tricky because I can see both the IT setup as technical debt and mine. My team is technically acting like a shadow IT in some ways and that always resulting in technical debt. However the dba is on an outdated SSIS. By that I mean he still uses msdb and hasn‚Äôt upgraded to ssisdb which would at least allow for basic version control.  Additionally as I said, he doesn‚Äôt really have anyone who knows ssis well on his team and therefore if he leaves one day my organization is in a pickle.  He can say similar for what I want to do but I am documenting everything I‚Äôm doing so there is at least that. Also I am training and have already trained people on my entire environment in case I leave. I do know that this point is probably the most debate point that I am making however. Overall I‚Äôm saying that if we move to a more modern setup that fits better with the skillset of those in and outside of the agency (outside matters since they are required to build their own data pipeline) then I think we can eventually get off ssis completely and overall have a more manageable system that more people are familiar with.\n\nI typed this up very quickly so it may not be the most clear response.",

You could also go the postgres route as those are fairly cheap on a number of clouds, but aren't optimized for analytics workloads though they are usable for smaller scale warehouses.\n\nThe database is the core, but then you need to figure out how to ingest the data from your source platforms to the warehouse and transform the data into table structures that support your reporting needs.  Again, there are a multitude of patterns and tools available.  A lot of companies with basic installs are using Fivetran or Airbyte to ingest the data and dbt to transform it.  Personally I wouldn't pay for those, but it simplifies the setup where teams are small or inexperienced.  \n\nThe real hit though is going to be contracting someone to build it.  It's absolutely not something you want to figure out on your own as someone that just writes some SQL and python.  Mistakes can cause issues with usability, create rework and even higher costs depending on your stack.  And to add to the fun, there are a lot of bad consulting firms out there that don't know WTF they are doing, so taking the lowest bid isn't necessarily going to get you to where you want to be.\n\nGood luck!",

There's also Martin in rust that does the same (and more as pg_tileserv). I haven't seen anything in wasm that improves upon deck and maplibre. Martin and pg_tileserv serve tiles in pbf binary format that gets fed straight to the GPU without any json parsing.",

Under the hood, NumPy typically uses C-level memory management (`malloc`/`free` or aligned variants) from the system runtime, though it also supports custom allocators.\n\nIn contrast, I expect stampdb to have lower overhead since it uses a straightforward C++ `std::vector` for memory management. By default, `std::vector` relies on the C++ allocator API, which eventually ends up at `malloc`/`free` as well. Our current plan is to provide only the thinnest wrapper around the C++ core.

But, it's a massive investment, and 3 years in we're still working on adding components that our manager estimated we'd have done in the first 6 months.\n\nIf you don't need that, its good, but get documentation of your code, your sql tables, try and centralise into a single semantic model if you can (short of data warehousing).  But the one thing that we keep running into with people creating their own dashboards is that they change the queries, they're no longer performant, take forever, use more resources, and they're reloading and recalculating the same details x 10 different queries in a power bi dashboard x 10 dashboards.\n\nSo, consolidation - if you can at least run the data out to a table, and then have any dashboards read from that table, then you'll be saving yourself.\n\nTry to source control your dashboards.\n\nIf you're using PBI online, if you can use things like datasets, that centralise the data, go for it.\n\nStored Procedures may give you more centralised control, semantic models are more or less exactly what you're creating in PowerBI anyway (source -> dim/fact tables + relationships + measures).\n\nCreating a centralised semantic model/warehouse that has all of your tables and data in one place, that you write your code and measures and everything once will definitely allow you to reuse it multiple times and is a big win.",

But when you want them, they're very useful indeed. \n\nTo begin with, without multi-table transactions, to try to emulate them, you end up implementing compensating transactions:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction\n\nWhich are difficult to get right, are eventually consistent (meaning, in the interim the inconsistent state is visible, and no guarantee on how fast your comlensating transaction will succeed, and generally just are a pain. They don't add value or spark joy. \n\nThere are also other features that are a lot easier to add to an engine once you have full ACID support. \n\nFor example, zero copy cloning a table - the copies can be modified independently, without data duplication for the shared parts:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/tutorial-clone-table-portal\n\nOr having a transactionally consistent snapshot across tables, instead of trying to use Delta time travel to achieve it:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/warehouse-snapshot\n\nIsolation wise, we get true snapshot isolation within the engine - queries via the Warehouse either see changes in no tables or all. The individual logs aren't written perfectly simultaneously though, so Delta log consumers benefit from that less, but still some - can see some parts of a multi-table committed transactions sooner maybe, but is guaranteed it's part of a committed transaction, not potentially part of an emulated multi table transaction that failed and will have a compensating transaction trying to cover it up sometime later.\n\nPerformance, we can potentially batch up multiple transactions into a Delta log entry. We have a nice fast transaction log, instead of relatively slow block blob storage operations being required on every individual commit.\n\nLocking, iirc, mostly the same - could maybe support pessimistic locking though, which iirc Delta can't. But paper probably says for sure.",

The programming fundamentals you've built over 4 years transfer well to data engineering - you understand APIs, software architecture, and debugging which are core skills. Many data engineering tools have .NET support or similar paradigms to what you're used to. The main gaps you'll need to fill are around data pipeline orchestration (Airflow, Prefect), cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP), and getting comfortable with SQL + maybe Python or Scala. Your API integration experience is actually really relevant since data engineers spend a lot of time building ETL pipelines that pull from various sources. Companies definitely value programming experience over pure data background - it's often easier to teach someone with solid dev skills about data concepts than to teach a data person how to write maintainable, scalable code. I'd suggest building a few portfolio projects that show end-to-end data pipelines and you should be competitive for junior/mid-level data engineering roles pretty quickly.",

Our pipelines ingest data from Salesforce and copy into snowflake using the bulk api 2.0 and python using snowflake stored procs orchestrated by azure data factory. For 40 objects, some with over 500 fields and over 800,000 records it takes about 5 minutes to get through them all and total cost with azure + snowflake is about $1 a day. It does full pulls daily and use hash comparisons to handle updated/new/deleted records. For issues I ran into, schema drift was a big one because my employer loves adding fields but snowflakes schema evolution made it super easy to deal with and track when new columns get added. With the bulk API 2.0 I had to use the describe object call to get all the fields then use that to build the bulk query but that is all relatively simple using python.",

Backend: tables only on the share. Each user gets a local front end with linked tables. Turn on record-level locking, no datasheet edits, and keep persistent connections. Disable Offline Files on the share and use wired only. Nightly copy + compact/repair on a backup, not the live file.\n\n\\- Python GUI: wrap inserts/updates in explicit transactions, commit, and log the inserted PKs. Add a CreatedAt and a soft-delete flag to avoid hard deletes. Check for cascade deletes and filters that might hide ‚Äúmissing‚Äù rows.\n\n\\- Better: move the backend to SQL Server Express or Postgres on a small VM, link via ODBC so Access keeps working. Add a rowversion/updated\\_at for optimistic concurrency. Point the GUI to an API and keep the search hitting a read-only replica (SQLite/Parquet export hourly).\n\nI‚Äôve used Supabase and Hasura for quick APIs; DreamFactory helped when we needed REST over legacy DBs with RBAC so clients never touched the database directly.\n\nBottom line: put writes behind a server DB/API and keep Access as just a front end.",

I can‚Äôt even tell you how many times I have been consulting, and I saw folks trying to do what you are.  The only real way is to run the data into a real analytics engine like Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.  Then materialize the result back to a different index.

Write each user into SEPARATE ordered extents into S3.\n\nStep 3: Run a single historical spark job to rewrite the data into historical logs for each user in the order the tables were designed in. Select where id > 0 && id < step1.table_id_seq. Upload those to each users extents.\n\nAll queries are now embarrassingly parallel, and you control the data, not Snowflake.\n\nIf you are under 100TB you can do this in under a week with a handful of spot instances, S3 and just one engineer (yourself).\n\nThese cloud vendors are literally selling shuffle debt as a service due to SQL destroying physical locality at ingest.

Don't think short term: cloud, full stack etc. Everything has a phase. There was a time when cloud engineers were highly paid.\n\n\n2. Never quit what you have in hand. Give your best to your current job. Think of ways to do thing better especially things around you at work that aren't your job.\n\n\n3. Always continue learning. If you like cloud tech, study it on your time. Take yourself at a level where next interviewer wants you badly in his/her team. Once done with cloud, study CI/CD or something else.\n\n\nOne's growth is never lateral and vertical is slow. Best growth is diagonal",

You can sit PuppyGraph on top of your existing relational databases (even MongoDB too), and query your existing data as a graph (using Gremlin or Cypher), without ETL into a separate graphdb. So same copy of data, you can query it in both SQL and graph. Our main product is the graph compute engine, but we did also created a visualization layer requested by our users. We open sourced it.

It \"looks weak\" without it because it is weak. Without a degree you have none of the business background, no math, no probability, no stats, no physics, no engineering, no logic, no years of proofs, no architecture, no operating systems, no systems programming, no threading, nothing.\n\nIt's my job to tutor all kinds of people. I've been watching people self-study vs university students, and the holes in their learning is immense. All they do is WebDev and LeetCode. They think they know Big O but they don't. They don't know that it's worst case and why worst case is the one that matters because they don't know what p and np are. They're failing interviews because they can't explain what a log is from high school math or a limit from Calculus. They think it's not important. They don't know binary or anything about how data is stored. They're grinding \"DSA\" but they don't know that cache misses make a program 100x slower, because they never took \"useless\" courses like architecture or operating systems. They don't really get what references are because they never managed memory. They don't know how to comment or write documentation. They've never seen an actor diagram. There are entire courses on all these topics. This is just off the top of my head.\n\nMeanwhile, cheating has ramped up big time over the past ten years. People were paying Indians thousands of dollars on Chegg and Upwork to do their entire coursework for them. I know this firsthand. That was before AI too. Now it's totally fucked. Teachers literally can't give homework and it's a learning crisis. I don't know why people pay so much for education just to cheat and get the paper but it's not long before employers catch on.\n\nEveryone has it backwards. The degree is what's invaluable, not the paper. If someone actually pays attention in school, they will learn things that others will never know. The reason why so many think education is useless is because so many cheated their asses off. It's ridiculous that people actually think there's nothing to be learned from four years of education, but here we are, defending it again from Reddit.\n\nHere's a link for anyone who wants to self-learn:  \n[https://github.com/ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)",

That means publishing scientific papers. You don't need a degree for this, but if you want to study it at this level, you will also be reading a lot of scientific papers as well.\n\nIf you want to be an engineer, like an actual engineer that requires certifications and to be able to code well enough that you're applying engineering principles to every project. If you want to be a REAL engineer, then that usually means gaining certifications from accredited organizations and/or governments. Think about it this way: A software engineer is, ideally, the type of person that creates software systems for things like nuclear power plants, utilitiy companies, hospitals etc.I look at it as you're working on aserious infrastructure projects and your code cannot break under any circumstances because the consequences could be catastrophic, costing people lives and stuff It always needs a failsafe if bad things happen. Like it still has to work somehow even if AWS or Azure servers go down. Multiple redudancies and all that.\n\nIf you simply want to code, you're a developer that mainly works n consumer grade apps. You don't need a degree or even necessarily certifications. You just need a somewhat robust portfolio, personal and volunteer projects, getting your apps into app stores, etc. IF things break down, people are merely inconvenienced.\n\n  \nDon't listen to all these others about a CS degree being meaningless. Even if you never work in industry, the benefits of being able to understand parts of society at a funademental level is valuable in and of itself....kind of like how a philosophy degree is a great investment in that it teaches you critical thinking skills",

Even a project that is poorly executed *but executed at all,* does wonders for both for your learning *and* for the resume.\n\nOne I have not tried yet but I bet would be a fabulous standout: a *debugging AI slop code* project. So here would be the steps:\n\n- Tell the AI of your choice to write some small application. You want it small to ensure you can fight it all by yourself, but make sure the AI doesn‚Äôt actually just knock it out of the park in one shot; if so, try again until you get something sufficiently buggy.\n\n- Debug the code. You might think that this needs to be fancy, but I cannot stress enough how basic this is. It can literally be just notes to yourself with a date explaining your thoughts. I wager it could say things like: ‚ÄúSo, the AI said it wrote X using Y method. Whaaaaaat is happening - I better check the documentation for Y. That is *not* how it looks, the documentation from Y imports completely different methods‚Ä¶.‚Äù Etc\n\n- Document the whole process, by which I mean the prompt used, the AIs response, the code it gave, and your debugging notes.",

        "body": "I will go in the exact opposite direction if some comments here: This is a tough question to answer, because it doesn't really matter. I mean, languages are cool and all, but learning a new programming language really is not that hard, once you already know how to program. You can learn any language similar to the ones you already know in a week. \n\nThe more important question is: What kind of project structure, architecture and patterns do you learn. If you are going for \"applications and tools\", that can also mean many things. GUI or no, Desktop or mobile, which target audience does it have, what should it do? \n\nIf you want to be the most versatile, able to learn \"anything(TM)\" that might come up in a few weeks time, I would suggest having experience in at least one project / language out of all of the following categories (and each project must have a minimum complexity to \"count\"): \n\n  \n\\- 1 web based frontend. Can be pure html/css/minimal JS, or be fully based on a JS framework. maybe a homepage for a simple business, without a shop, like a bakery or a hair salon. \n\n\\- 1 non-web based frontend. A C# GUI in windows, a Java App on Android, a Swift UI on iOS or a QT-App in any language you want, it doesn't matter much. Probably a complexity between a calculator and a calendar would be good. Games work, but are normally structured differently, do I would advise against using a game engine unless you want to stick with gaming. \n\n\\- 1 complex application, written in a low level language, optimized for speed. A raytracer is the classical option, because it has good visual feedback, but a compiler, OS parts or a real time embedded component can all work. Suitable languages are C, C++ and rust. A compiler has the additional benefit of teaching you more about programming languages in general.\n\n\\- 1-2 APIs. It is great if you have both written a REST (or similar) API, accessible through the web (in theory, you don't need to deploy) as well as a library, that exposes a C-standard API for use from other programs. They are pretty similar in conception, but quite a bit different in practice, and understanding how both of these actually work, can be hugely helpful, even if you are only using them, and never have to build them again! \n\nYou should 100% have experience in one Object Oriented language. The best options are Java and C#. OOP (or some half hearted attempt at OOP) is still the standard in most industries. \n\nAdditionally, you should be comfortable in a language, suitable for scripting. Python and JavaScript, but also Bash are all options with different advantages. You need to know at least one. \n\nI think everyone can learn something from trying something completely different, so you should have done one project in a completely functional language. Haskell is my favourite, but F# and Clojure are also options. You will have to re-learn to think about programming, which is exactly the point of the exercise, not to use this exact language again in production. (Which you absolutely can, just mot people prefer not to)",

You could use C++ or rust or java, I would suggest C++. You'll need to pick up a graphics API. Anything that can plot pixels arbitrarily would be good enough, something like SDL.\n\nI'm not trying to discourage you, but \\*making\\* something like doom is very difficult. \\*Porting\\* doom is not, because Doom itself is built to be portable, you only have to rewrite like 7 files to port doom, but \\*making\\* doom is and of itself a very, very difficult CS problem. You don't just need to know comp sci, you need to know best practices, and have a good grasp of boolean algegbra. Doom is going to be throwing around terms like \"R-trees\" or \"Binary space partitioning\" so be prepared.\n\nAt the heart, what you want to make is a raycaster. Not \\*ray tracing,\\* but raycasting. The idea is you will write something that shoots rays out into the world, checks what they collide with, then renders that collision. It shoots a ray for every vertical column on the screen. That will get you a basic wolfenstein-like look, but those games, \\*especially\\* doom, do way more than just ray cast out in to the world.

        "body": "I finished a BS in computer science in Dec 2020, in a very similar situation - barely got through capstone, no internship experience beyond the capstone itself, no personal projects and no clue where to start with one - and it took me a hot sec, but ultimately I actually ended up in a Java web dev job, even though I'd spent 4y focusing on low level programming in C/C++ and thought I'd go on to do something wildly different.\n\nI know the panic, the uncertainty and despondancy, but it's normal. CS education isn't technical school -- it taught you how to figure out how to develop solutions, how to learn new skills as a project demands, it almost certainly did NOT teach every single skill you'd ever use on the job. You will learn as you go, that is just the nature of the field. The knowledge snowballs, yes, but getting a new project, having no idea how to complete it, and having the skill to research and teach yourself is THE most important skill you can take away from formal CS education.\n\nAI is a research accerator and a peer programmer in your pocket. My employer recently started expecting us to start using AI like we've been using IDEs -- a core tool to speed and supercharge our development. So start/continue using AI as your coding partner and a research aid. Don't vibe code - hell no - but anything you'd search the internet to know, ask AI first, then dig a little deeper, fact check it - its the faster version of digging through stack overflow and stack exchange and reddit to cross reference the collective knowledge, right? And have AI write code, do a peer review, build on what it writes, feed it back in - go back and forth with it, like you would peer programming. Use it to bounce ideas around and fill the gaps in your knowledge. If you rock up to an interview with the skill of knowing how to utilize AI effectively in your development, then you WILL be the most attractive candidate, because, honestly, a lot of experienced devs are behind the curve figuring it out and we're feeling the heat from our employers with all their crazy high hopes for AI.\n\nIf you like web dev, there are still plenty of jobs out there, even if the job landscape has thinned out and changed in the last 5-10 years. But also be open to try anything - I NEVER thought I'd end up a web dev, I didn't do well in those courses in school so I thought it was the LAST thing I'd ever do, but I'm SO GLAD I gave it a chance and I ended up liking it so much more than I'd ever thought I would.\n\nAlso, I got lucky: I was a year and a half out of school and struggling to get an interview for junior roles and was kicking myself for not trying to get an internship the minute I graduated. Some internships will accept you shortly after graduation, but most won't accept you more than a year out. But when I reached out to a connection about a junior role at their company, their company countered by offering me an internship which turned into a full-time offer and I've been there nearly 3 years now. \n\nSo 1) If you want workplace experience after graduation, definitely don't give up on internships (plural, even if you finish one, don't assume its gotta be one and done); post-grad internships are out there and experience is experience and employers love demanding 2-3y of experience from new grads and junior devs for some crazy reason. 2) Build your connections, reach out to your connections, never stop making them even after you land a job; they don't stress that enough in school, hell it probably should be it's own course its that important.",

In the languages you listed c++ is probably the hardest language to learn weather you learn it, first, second or fifth.\n\nAnd then you have languages which are just different. Javascirpt has prototype inheritance, yes even the modern versions with a class keyword still don't work the way you would expect them to. Really Javascript is a Lisp with C like syntax, and it works best if you treat it as such and write functional rather than object oriented code. Go and Rust are not Object oriented and also require a different coding approach. \n\nYou also have more exotic languages like Lisp, Prolog or Haskel that use completely different abstractions because they are just not descended from C at all. These are harder to learn because everything is different. But you are also unlikely to encounter these languages in a professional setting because very little production code is written in them.",

It's a useless metric for actually working on code.\n\nImagine programming as a gigantic space of possibilities. You're searching for positions (programs) in that space that fulfil certain functional (the thing the program should do) and usually some non-functional requirements (memory/time constraints, being readable and maintainable). There's not one solution but many, but they are far out (as far as lines you need to write to get there). Each line you write gets you closer to some solutions and farther from others.\n\nUnless you have decades of experience and the program is quite small, it's usually not possible to just \"see\" a good solution and write it down in one go. You need to iterate on it, write parts of it you know will likely be part of a good solution. And even identifying those is lots of experience. Often you'll have to rewrite parts to make it work.\n\nThe first running prototype is usually garbage because it shows the meandering path you took to get there. Restructuring and cleaning up your solution is still expected when you work on large programs, so that the overall commit history doesn't look like a rabbit on acid typed it. This is something that is discussed in professional settings as well. If coders think refactorings are necessary, who will pay for them?

Every line you write or fix or debug is a little closer to competency.\n\nEDIT: Specifically for your concern about knowing syntax, you won't remember how to perfectly write the syntax for everything you learn.

Installation guides, both for beginners and for \"Python veterans\". They are short enough, so I can skim them both quickly. \n\n2. both tutorials. I will probably follow along with the \"Quick Start\", because it's short and will let me see some concepts hands on to start with, and I will skim the longer tutorial, as I personally already know how SQL works, and how an ORM works. If I were new to either of those concepts, I would work through it completely. \n\n3. I skip the migration notes, because... duh. \n\n4. Now we come to the complexity: In the section \"Reference and How to\" I would stop reading \"everything\", instead I would skim the chapter titles and try to remember, which information is available. Later, when I go ahead and actually map my first classes, I will open \"Mapping Python Classes\" and \"Relationship Configuration\", and then, when I go to test it, I would probably read more configuration stuff, so that I can be sure I didn't miss any important config options. \n\n5. I will skim the relevant Dialect Documentation, PostgresQL in my case. The most important things to note will probably be highlighted, and if I skimeed it, I will be able to go back later when there's an issue and be able to know, where to find the relevant information. \n\nEverything else I would just search in the docs, as it comes up. Such as error messages, or how to do a specific kind of relationship. \n\nJust reading and skimming what I outlined above will probably take 1-2 hours. Reading the entire documentation would take days, and I would forget nearly everything. The important part is not to know what to do outright, but where to find the information you need!

Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nAnd finally, I'll leave some of my comments to previous, similar posts, as this is a very frequently discussed topic:\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j9ezmx/getting_better_at_coding/mhdna2e/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1iz7wv3/how_to_become_a_better_engineer/mf10qbg/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j3w7x9/how_to_actually_learn_problem_solving_skills/mg3q9ya/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ioehwa/struggling_to_put_together_my_own_code/mcirhxq/\n+ https://redd.it/1jyd36k",

At some point you need to just start building small projects, if you cannot think of a small project spend some time thinking about how to split a larger project into smaller modular ones. Set a time limit for your project, then once done or time has run out reflect on what you wanted to achieve, what you did achieve, what problems you encountered, how you solved them and what you would do different next time, afterwards, move on to the next project. Repeat until you feel confident to tackle bigger projects.\n\nA note on AI, having someone or something constantly tell you solutions to problems, diminished learning results. Your brain just gets lazy and used to it. This isn't even unique to AI, this is just how learning works, reddit can do the same if people wouldn't be so openly hostile towards people asking for help with minor issues. Instead tell your preferred AI that it should never just give you the solution and just analyze your code and point out where an issue might be. Then attempt to solve it by yourself. Only use it if you are actually stuck or don't understand the stack trace of error messages. As sometimes error messages can be terribly obscure.",

It is in part because children aren't self-conscious about trying to talk - they'll just say shit and if they say it wrong, whatever, an adult will correct them. Whereas adults will be hesitant to even try to speak until they're sure they'll say the right thing, which slows learning right now.\n\nYou really do need to work from the bottom up mastering the basics first.

        "body": "There's a concept called the Entity Component System model, or ECS which solves this issue in a way that also makes writing high performance code much easier. \n\nThe idea is that instead of having discrete classes for different kinds of creatures, items, or other game entities with all sorts of complex logic attached to them, you create simple data structure called an entity. An entity is usually nothing more than some kind of ID value, like an integer, UUID, or even a string. You then \"attach\" additional small components to that entity which give it additional properties. It's these components that hold the data that would have been held in the class. So the `hasHealth` component would hold maybe 2 numbers, max health and current health.  \n\nAll of the logic for the various components is handled by a set of \"system\" classes. Their job is to handle the logic associated with the various components. For example, the health system would handle adding or removing health on entities with a health component.\n\nTypically the way ECS are written let you query the world for entities with specific components (or the components of an entity and such), or sometimes more complex conditions like \"has components x y and z, but not a\". This query then will find the components that match and produce a list of entries which can then be processed by the system.\n\nThis is probably complete overkill for what you're doing, but it's becoming a very popular way to write games. It gets rid of the awkward problems that come from a more object oriented approach, and completely strips all dependencies between components and entities. This allows you to build up unique entities simply by combining different discrete components. Of course, for unique interactions you would occasionally still need to make 1-off components, but a *lot* can be done with only a small collection of basic components when you can freely mix and match everything, and implementing new kind of entities is often just a matter of figuring out what components they need.\n\nThis roguelike tutorial in Rust does a great job of explaining/teaching how you might use an ECS in a roguelike game: https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/chapter_2.html\n\nRoguebasin has a very basic Python implementation of an ECS: https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Entity_Component_System\n\nThere's a ton more information on ECS out there, this was just meant to give you a very very rough idea of the overall concept. There are quite a few ECS libraries out there in a whole ton of languages, but it's not that difficult to write your own either (at least as long as your not trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of it).\n\nHere are a couple blog posts that explain ECS and implement one:\n\nC++ - https://www.codingwiththomas.com/blog/an-entity-component-system-from-scratch\n\nC++ - https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/\n\nC# - https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/\n\nHere's an ECS FAQ: https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq?tab=readme-ov-file",

But with #define it will just put in whatever you typed, say 1.1 but with const it will put '1.1d0', this is just a short hand for 1.1000000000....\n\nThis kind of thing matters for precision calculations.

The reason is because when it is 1.1, the C standard automatically casts it as float by detecting it as a decimal number.  But it doesn't know how to handle 1.1d0 in this context.  In fact most functions don't even do casting for you.  However with a 'const' the standard knows exactly what to do and printf's templating macro code knows how to pick the right printf to be linked into your program.",

The key to this is to look at the center line\n\n    4321234\n\nEach number is listed twice except 1, so you can use the formula `2n - 1` to indicate the width. In this case, `n` refers to the largest number (or the initial number picked).\n\nThe pattern is basically in two parts. There's the stuff reaching the middle line\n\n    4444444\n    4333334\n    4322234\n    4321234\n\nThen, there's the rest of it.\n\n    4322234\n    4333334\n    4444444\n\n### What's the pattern?\n\nYou'll notice the numbers are basically seven 4's on the first line, five 3's on the next line, three 2's, and finally one 1 at the end. So the pattern is: 7, 5, 3, 1.\n\nThe idea is you print the numbers doing down, like \n\n   43\n\nThen when you reach 2, you print 2 three times, \n\n   43222\n\nThen, you do 3 4 at the end (going back up).\n\n   4322234\n\n\n### Coding logic\n\nSo, let's see how we can do that one line. Let's put it in a function\n\n    void printLine(int size, int patternLength, int currNumber)\n\n        // Step 1. Count down\n        for (int i = size; i > currNumber; i--) {\n           printf(\"%d\", i);\n        }  \n \n        // Step 2. Print repeated numbers\n        for (int i = 0; i < patternLength; i++) {\n           printf(\"%d\", currNumber);\n        }\n        // Step 3. Count up (you do this)\n\n        // Final newline\n        printf(\"\\n\");\n    }\n\nSo, then you have the main function\n\n    int main() {\n        // Assume the user enters in a size and it's stored in size\n       int size = readSizeFromUser();\n       int patternLength = 2 * size - 1;\n       int currNumber = size;\n       // Print the pattern up to the midpoint\n       for (int i = size; i >= 1; i--) {\n           printLine(size, patternLength, currNumber);\n           patternLength -= 2; // Next number is printed this many times\n           currNumber--; // The next number is decreased from the current\n       }\n       // Another loop to go from 2 to size to do 2nd half\n    }\n\nI've left a lot of code out for you to think about, but hopefully, you get the idea.",

Usually this will result in the easiest-to-test and most-likely-to-be-correct solution.\n\nIf you can't figure out the general rule, take a piece of the problem which is solvable and then work backwards from there. For example, for n = 3, the middle line is this:\n\n    32123\n\nFirst write a loop that outputs just this line, for any n. That's part of the problem. Then work backwards to make it work similarly for the other lines (so that the line before middle is 32223, and so on). Doing it this way is fine too, but there are more opportunities to mess things up or to get edge cases wrong.\n\nFor the given problem this is not really a problem, though, since \"exhaustive testing\" is pretty straightforward. You can run your entire solution on all values of n = 1 through n = 9 inclusive and make sure that the output is according to the specification.

Can you entirely avoid branching aside from the necessary loops by writing a value every time? How can you generalize your condition to give you a number to write instead of a boolean? This will prevent a large void in the middle.\n\nSomething that might make it more efficient: how can you restructure the loops such that the number to be written at each position can be directly inferred from only the iterator values at that position, so aside from the code configuring the loops, nothing else needs to be aware of how large the square is? If you try to make n only exist in the loop headers, I think you will find a more elegant solution without a big mess of addition and subtraction of i, j, n, and 1 going on inside every iteration.

They don't care what the product is, they just want an interesting bug to fix or some code to optimize and they're happy. At a big tech company some people can easily stay busy doing nothing but that, never thinking about the product. They might love refactoring or adding test infrastructure.\n\nOther people like programming but they're motivated by the product, or by the user experience. They're motivated by the user-facing bugs and will happily dig through whatever needs to be done to fix it. They might not be as interested in projects to refactor, improve developer productivity, or add test infrastructure.\n\nBoth are fine, you just need to figure out which one is a better fit for you (or somewhere in-between).\n\nIf you're motivated more by the product, you might want to think of companies that you're really excited about - the programming work there might be more up your alley.",

Particularly [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). It‚Äôs how I myself started coding, with python same as you. It has a bunch of problems arranged by difficulty going from 8-kyu (easiest) to 1-kyu(hardest) iirc. You can start doing some of the 8 kyu ones and progress as you see fit. You have as long as you want to solve them, and once you do you can see other‚Äôs solutions.\n\nDO NOT USE AI, or be very careful in its use. Always always always understand the code you‚Äôre using. And especially for these types of projects, I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt use ANY code generated by ai, it kinda defeats the purpose. You can use it as a googling aid ‚Äúhow do I get the length of an array, but not as an actual coding assistant ‚Äúgive me a loop that finds the highest value‚Äù.\n\nAlso, when you see code by others, don‚Äôt think you learned whatever you saw because you understood it.

But if the next time you find that problem you can‚Äôt remember or recreate the solution, you‚Äôre still fucked.

Nowadays this topic is often called \"serialization\" i.e. turning some abstract data representation into a serial stream of data, and back again.\n\nJust as one example, look at how the [\"Protocol Buffers\"](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/) binary encoding format works. It defines a general-purpose way to describe \"messages\" in terms of their fields, and each field's type determines how it is encoded, in such a way that you can always tell where one field ends and another begins.\n\nIt uses the same \"length prefix\" approach that you'll see in a lot of other formats, but it also uses a variable-length encoding trick for integers, which means that small integers take up less space than large ones. This applies to the data itself, but also to the type/length metadata.\n\nReusing an off-the-shelf encoding format like Protobuf will save you a lot of tedious manual work.\n\nOr if your goal is just to obscure the data from casual viewing with a text editor, you can just do something even simpler and compress your JSON representation using something like gzip. Maybe add an extra custom header so various tools don't automatically recognize it as compressed data.",

Opening a file with a particular header marking it as txt tells whatever is opening it ‚Äúhey, this data is in such and such format like UTF-8. Read bytes of this length and display this data as characters. ¬†A dat or bin file just *doesnt* say ‚Äúhey, read me as text‚Äù, but is still just an array of binary.

As you are trying to create your own format you'll have to make something up yourself. There are catalogues of already taken magic numbers online.\n\nThen goes header. On offsets from the beginning of the file specified by the format specification there are several numbers telling information about the file: time of creation, modification, size, etc. For example, if you specified that bytes from 16th to 24th will mean time of last modification, you take amount of milliseconds since UNIX timestamp (start of 1970), transform it into a 64-bit integer and write into these bytes.\n\nOne way to add arbitrary data to your file is to add the list of offsets. Say on predefined position of 32th to 40th byte you write the offset to the first bit of an array of entries in your binary file. Computer follows this offset, where you write, in sequence, offset to next array if it exists (or 0 if it doesn't), amount of offsets to various elements in this array, and then list offsets, each is a 64-bit number. Now the reader can read and save them. By following these offsets, it may find your data. Data entry may look like an integer specifying length of a string or array and then bytes of this data.",

Sure, this puts me at a disadvantage compared to other people who I will inevitably be competing against. It will likely take me longer to get to the role that I want. But, eventually it will all work out in the end. \n\nAs for the family thing, they need to understand that your time is precious. I have dinner with the family and then will spend an hour or so playing video games with the kids but they know when Dad is in the office it better be an emergency. They get it and respect it. The same needs to go with your parents and siblings. Obviously you are living under their roof so you need to follow your parents rules. It's not too much to ask for you to help out around the house. But I would have a heart to heart and tell them that the only way your going to succeed is with their support and that support comes at a cost when it comes to family activities.",

Doing something is better than doing nothing.\n\nI don't know how much work you want to put into learning - but I've found that learning how computers work is by far the most important thing that makes everything make infinitely more sense. When I say \"how computers work\" - I mean things like the different components in your CPU, how the ALU works, how instructions are executed, how memory is allocated, how processes are managed by your OS - all those kinds of lower-level plumbing things. \n\nThe problem isn't that you are not talented / smart enough - the problem is that computers are a giant clusterfuck of abstractions upon abstractions, and understanding what the hell is going on down to the electrical level takes a lot of time and a lot of learning, hence why coding might look & feel like \"magic\".\n\nTL;DR - If you want to *actually* become proficient, then start teaching yourself more about how computers work. Also I'd recommend just starting with Python and using something like PyGame to make a simple game. You will most likely never run into Godot in your life ever again.",

Learning a language is easy but learning how to program is hard the same way learning to use a saw is easy but being a great wood worker takes time. The language is your tool. Being a competent programmer is to change how you think. Which is something anyone can learn. You just have to be patient and be open minded and it will eventually start clicking. \n\nBreak every problem down to tiny micro steps and tackle each one. Want to move a character? Well how do i read what button to input? How do I set the velocity of the character? How do I animate it? Three little problems from one problem that sounded small in the first place. \n\nDon't let perfection be the enemy of progress as a professional programmer i still look at my code and think I can do better. Body builders are never entirely happy with their figure and still want more muscle growth. The same thing happens in our brain with code. \n\nEven very successful games have had a history of terrible code. Pok√©mon sun and moon is a very famous example of poor project organization and I'm pretty sure eve online had to rewrite their engine before because of how much spaghetti was in it. It happens and you will learn with experience. Just keep making your games and more will click\n\nAlso, I do want to address the anxiety here. If you go in to every hobby and skill wondering if it's for you and get analysis paralysis then you will never truly enjoy anything new and give it a chance. If you have a hard time addressing this i do recommend seeking help and learning to be more comfortable in your own head and getting some confidence",

Then at api endpoints, each has a http verb and a route and will return a http response code.  You don‚Äôt need to know it by heart but look at what response codes could be returned, look at which verb each route uses and understand why - then you can build test cases to hit each one, like what data gets you a 200 ok response vs a 400 error response and how can you make each happen. \n\nKeep a notebook with everything you hear that you‚Äôre not sure about and Google.

APIs are how systems are made to be interacted with, think the buttons on the remote of your TV. *A Philosophy of Software Design* makes some interesting points about API design, but I think you'll need to progress a bit more before going into it.\n\nWebhooks are just a call back address for inter-service communication, the only trip up here is how more complex ones are implemented in code, but I don't think this should worry you at this point - the gist of it is \"Here's what I want, call me back on this number when you have it\".\n\nFor the rest, there's no specific order you have to learn things in, nor is there an expectation that you will instantly develop a deep understanding of any of these topics, as long as you understand how they fit together. Might as well focus on learning things that will help you be better at automation and save the deep dives for later\n\n1. TCP/IP, REST + others, if working in web\n2. Database basics, lock contention, ACID (if your work has you interacting/testing databases in any way)\n3. What does it mean to actually deploy something, what's going on behind the scenes (ssh, cp, configs, env vars)\n4. The basics of your language of choice, most common data structures (arrays, lists, maps)\n5. Once you're comfortable writing some code in the language you'll be using, go into whatever testing framework you'll be using (selenium?)\n\nNo one knows everything, so I suggest focusing on things directly related to what you want to do and then slowly expand your knowledge out of professional curiosity and/or to upskill.",

A lot of mobile apps are actually Web apps in disguise. Take a look at all the really terrible storefronts you can choose from like Amazon, Temu, Shien, etc. Theyre probably all using the same APIs as the websites do.\n\nI wouldn't say you're too far behind your peers most junior devs know very little about the stack they're starting with because frankly it's ridiculous to memorize and have experience with the hundreds if not thousands of options available. Personal projects is a great way to familiarize yourself with stacks you haven't used before.\n\nFor your project: You should probably listen to your professors, you want a good grade and good recommendations. I wouldn't change the idea I would change the execution. You can, for example, use something like React Native to use Web technology (HTML, css, and js) to make a mobile app for IoS and Android.",

Do not do that. Your teacher is not qualified to be teaching you. Unfortunately, you are where you are. \n\nWhat you \\*should\\* be asking is, what did you spend all that time on instead? I am going to give you the bottom line, I have worked in software for over 25 years, almost \\*invariably\\* the people in the field who a) get very good and b) enjoy their lives at work are those people who would not have done what you have done, because the project would have excited them from the start and they would be desperate to get hacking on it. \n\nThat's not you and you need to accept that. The question is, is this now your best option? If you tell me you have spent the last 3 years sitting on your ass and playing video games, maybe any kind of switch is going to take time, if however you told me you have been busy with other hobbies and interests, I would honestly and seriously tell you to choose one of those to turn into a profession if you can. \n\nSoftware development isn't going anywhere, but the gold rush is \\*over\\*. There were times when you could phone it in, and collect your $250'000 salary but you missed them. If you enjoy it, it's great work and you wont get your hands very dirty. If you can't be bothered and just want to get through your day, you'll be miserable and a nuisance to everybody around you \\*even if you can find a job\\*. \n\nBe careful with this.

There are cases where an AI backend is a wonderful and effective thing, but it is not always the case. For many tasks, thats just a crazy bloat, which slows down the app, makes it like 10x more expensive to run, and consumes much more electricity, all that to achieve the same exact result. \n\nSo, just go and make projects you enjoy. And as for the AI, do not use it as a default solution to everything. Might be a fun addition sometimes, but not always. Instead, if you want, use it as your stack overflow summarizer, or debug assist.

When I finally did take the class, I did really well on it because I knew most of the material already. I also knew, based on my experience with the textbook, that the subject matter interested me.\n\nAlso, I always tell people to check out the FAQ here on r/LearnProgramming, it has got good learning resources. This: \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/w/faq\n\nIt helps to have a coding project that you're currently working on. \n\n> \"I graduate in three years and wanted to hear from other perspectives on whether CS is a good route to take. The reason I'm so on edge is because of the job market right now. I've heard from many others that it's hard to get a job with a CS degree and I don't want to make the wrong choice for my future.\" \n\nThe job market for junior programmers can be tough, yeah. To even have a chance you need a good LinkedIn, a good GitHub (you can pin up to 6 projects to the front of your GitHub), and a reviewed resume (r/CsCareerQuestions has two resume review days a week). To use GitHub you need to learn the command line tool called \"git\". To use a command line tool, you need to learn the command line. There's a lot and it's all unfamiliar to you now. \n\nAlso, the job market fluctuates over years, and you don't know what the market will look like when you graduate. Will it be a market that favors employers or workers in three years? We don't know. The job market is always good for nurses, but it's not always good for tech. \n\nBut yeah, sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, I have a Computer Science bachelor's degree and 2.5 years of past professional programming experience.",

Since there are conflicting views of how advanced AI is now and how quickly it can learn and develop much further, I wouldn't stop learning just in case the idea that AI will take over everything in 5 years is wrong.\n\nBesides, there is not enough fresh water in most countries for the water needs of AI facilities in addition to supporting humanity. That may slow things down. Since the facilities need more land area but also cool temperatures, why can't they be built at least partially underground to conserve both land and water?\n\nPerhaps u could focus on building things that would help build up city services or get things modernized for underdeveloped areas.\n\nI understand that everyone wants to make lots of money, but since u have found a full-time job already, u have set yourself on a good path to make a life u want. Maybe your idea for using IT could help u work with non-profits and places that can't pay hundreds of thousands up front, but that u can help because u want to serve the public. \n\nTry to think of longer-term projects for your skills. \n\nI wish you the best and am happy that u have already accomplished so much.

Case in point, my entire cycle has been spent refactoring something that was written in January (I'm guessing with AI tools) that is beginning to break in subtle ways.\n\nThough the job has undoubtably changed with these new tools at our disposal, I think there will continue to be software engineers for the foreseeable future. So from that perspective, there's still a value to learning your craft.\n\nAs for the market, there's nothing I can say but I feel for you- I hope openings for juniors open up again. I think the decision to stop hiring juniors is incredibly short sighted, but it is what it is. Do your best to network and turn non-leads into leads. Listen to whatever career progression framework your bootcamp offers.\n\nAs for burnout, take a break if you can- try and think about this from a long-term perspective and try and enjoy learning and making things for their own sake. That's what this career is about at the end of the day and there's nothing wrong with giving yourself space to reconnect with that. Good luck.",

At the end of the day, AI can walk the walk but you as a professional should know what AI has written and then use your creativity to tweak the code to better suit your needs.

        "body": "Repositories are self-contained dependency trees of commits. Every repository has an index or staging area which is where you add the changes that you intend to commit eventually. The staging area acts as a temporary safe space that is not a full commit and to which you can restore your tracked files if for some reason you aren't happy with the latest changes, and the changes saved to the staging area can also be restored. When you make a commit, only the changes tracked in the staging area are used.\n\nCommits in a repository are uniquely identified by hashes, which look like long strings of random characters that are in fact generated from all the information that they save. Commits contain the hashes of their immediate ancestors, the differences in the code between them and their immediate ancestors, the names and E-mail addresses of their authors, a timestamp, a message explaining what they change and why so that other people in the future can gain a deeper understanding of why specific changes were made, and optionally a digital signature to reinforce their authenticity. Commits represent snapshots of branch states at specific times.\n\nSince commit hashes aren't easy to remember, git provides the ability to tag them with more remarkable names. Tags are often used to record milestones, like the official version of a project at that point, but they can be used for anything you want, and can always have descriptions independent of their respective commit messages.\n\nBranches represent distinct and possibly concurrent development paths, and every git repository has at least one conventionally named main these days or master in the past, however branches can have arbitrary names. Branches are simply alternative HEAD pointers, you can create a branch from any commit in the repository, which will result in its HEAD pointing at that commit, and after that every commit you make to that branch will have the original commit of the branch as an ancestor in its history. Branches are typically used to avoid cluttering the main history of the project with irrelevant versioning information related to refactoring, bug fixing, feature development, or even to continue developing old versions of the same project concurrently to the main branch.\n\nRemotes provide the ability to name external repositories, and are intended to synchronize with the work done by other developers. Each branch can also track a single branch on a remote repository, which is typically used to synchronize with an upstream source of truth, and doesn't really need to have the same name as the local branch. Pushing to a remote branch attempts to append your changes in a local branch to the remote branch, whereas pulling attempts to append the remote changes of the remote branch to your local branch. If this succeeds then the resulting trivial merge is called a fast forward, otherwise you will be required to resolve the conflicts before the local and remote repositories can be synchronized. The HEAD of a tracked remote branch is pointed at by REMOTE_HEAD\n\nMerging is a process in which two divergent branches, both local or one local and one remote, are synchronized by a commit that addresses all the conflicts. Since only local branches can be written to, the merge commit is always created locally. After a merge all the concurrent commits are added to the history of the local branch, which can make the commit history rather confusing to understand. A different option to merging is rebasing, where all the divergent changes in one of the branches are added on top of the other branch, but this too can mess up the commit history, because if both branches have been getting concurrent commits, the timestamps in the resulting history where all the commits to one branch are logically applied after all the commits to the other branch will result in a history of commits that are not progressive over time, so git also provides the ability to squash commits, which can be used to coalesce a range of commits.\n\nReverting is the process in which the changes made by one or more commits are applied in reverse to a branch, effectively resulting in those changes being removed from the code. Reverting commits does not alter the commit history of a branch, instead a new revert commit is created specifically to remove the changes, at which point the author of the reverse is given a chance to address any conflicts that might prevent the operation. Switching is a process in which git is instructed to go back to any commit in the repository. If the switch is made to a branch then the local files will be updated to the HEAD commit of the branch, otherwise the switch is considered headless and no commits can be made until a branch is created to track them. Resetting moves the HEAD of a branch to any commit on the repository, which can result in some commits becoming unreachable and eventually garbage collected.\n\nStashing is the concept of committing your changes to a local commit tracker and restoring everything to how it was in the previous commit. Stashes are global and as such are completely independent of branches.\n\nOther concepts like pull requests, forks, and releases are specific to GitHub. Pull requests are just regular posts to a repository linking to a branch on your own repository whose changes you would like to get merged with the remote repository. Forks are just other developers cloning your repository under a new repository on their own account. Releases are essentially tags on steroids that you can use to provide ready-to-use builds of your project.\n\nGit is also quite versatile when it comes to rewriting history, however this is a fairly advanced subject that I'm not going to touch on here since it requires a good understanding of its fundamental concepts. Rewriting history can sometimes make commits unreachable from any branch, and These commits are kept around for a while but eventually git's garbage collector gets rid of them, however this grace period makes it possible to recover them, so even if you completely mess up a repository it's almost always possible to manually recover everything back during this period.\n\nHopefully this comment covers all the basics with enough detail but without being overwhelming.",

Plenty documentation, plenty tutorials, and a very welcoming community.\n\nIf you want to venture outside game development, look into *Python* as it is a great starter language, high in demand, very versatile, multi purpose. In that case, start with the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki.\n\n\"Hard\" is debatable. Programming *languages* by themselves aren't \"hard\" or \"easy\". *Programming* is hard - but by creating things with Scratch you've basically already covered that base. Even though Scratch appears as childish, block based system, it is still real programming. It has every single fundamental concept of programming, only that it is presented in a graphical manner. If you are competent programming in Scratch, you have the programming *logic* down. Now, you only need to learn the vocabulary and grammar of textual programming languages (which is actually the easier part of learning programming).",

(teaches you events)\n- Use the push switch to turn a flashing LED on and off (combines events with loops)\n- Add multiple LEDs and build a binary counter from 0 to `n` (teaches `for` loops specifically)\n- Pushing the button resets the counter.\n- Add a second button that changes the behaviour of the LED (e.g. switches between flashing and counting; teaches functions/separation of behaviours).\n\nEverything you do with the LED, you can do with a servo, relay, transistor, or anything else that can be connected to a circuit.\n\nOnce you've worked out how to control output with a button, you can think about using different kinds of input, like using a thermistor to react to a temperature change, or an LDR to react to light levels.",

I think that‚Äôs because yeah‚Ä¶, repeating exercises is boring af. BUT repetition is also what makes things stick. Think of music, which in fact is also a language in its own context. You hear a song enough and you can recognize it. \n\nWe communicate with symbols and logic. You gotta learn what the symbols mean in the specific context and then how to use them to express what you want. \n\nSo a breakdown of an example you gave in another comment. \n-Program in C (language/format)\n-Seconds to minutes (formula)\n\nEven if you don‚Äôt know that 60s = 1 min by memory, you can find the formula and write it down. The C language will have a way to write the function, the variables and handle any printing or user interaction. That‚Äôs the part you gotta know or find out about the language beforehand (like rules or properties). The coding skill comes from being able to write down that broken logic into the computer code. So you gotta be familiar with the language and how it works. \n\nBut in general terms you can do things for everything. Problems will sometimes have a full sentence to just say something is equal (the same) to another thing. You can usually simplify it into formulas or terms like: 3 bananas + 3 apples = 6 fruit. Instead of thinking ‚Äúhow pretty we can say something‚Äù in the language we‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúhow fast can we make a computer understand it‚Äù. I can say ‚ÄúI would like 6 of that delicious fruit, please good sir.‚Äù or I can say ‚Äú6 fruit‚Äù. In logical terms they mean the same. ‚ÄúI would like‚Äù implies addition for me, which would different to ‚ÄúHere you go, some fruit‚Ä¶‚Äù which would mean a loss for me. \n\nI hope that gives some perspective of the fundamentals of logic and operational thinking.",

An advice I can give you is pick a programming language you want to learn properly, identify a great resource to learn it and then learn it and build projects. Don't jump from one language to another just because you think you understood the basics. Use the basics to build projects that get more complex from project to project. If you gonna learn Web Development then one resource I can recommend because I did it myself is the Odin Project. It's free and open source.

If you want just 2d art, Krita on pc is a free drawing program that works well, I'm mostly on ipad so procreate is what I often use. If you want 3d, blender is free and great, it has a good community and a lot of tutorials, it can be a bit hard to learn but it's a nice skill to have.",

(My university had a student resource center to help all students with disabilities.) If you don't have a student resource  center, just meet with the person or office that helped you get an interpreter. \n\nI hope my suggestions make sense.

I'll try to answer each of your specific questions, as well as point you to reading material for each of those areas.\n\n>Based on my understanding, I have to¬†`tsc`¬†client and server since the browser and node can only read js.\n\nLet's talk about each of those two separately, starting with your client. You are correct that the browser can only read JS. However, since you're using Vite, one of its built-in features is that it will automatically transpile your TS to JS ([docs](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#typescript)). Therefore, you don't need `tsc` to do that ‚Äî and, therefore, you *should* have `\"noEmit\": true` in your frontend `tsconfig.json`.\n\nMoving on to the server, Node.js recently added native support for executing TypeScript directly ([docs](https://nodejs.org/api/typescript.html)), so you *might* be able to use that. However, if your hosting provider uses an older version of Node.js that doesn't support that, then yes, you are correct that you'll need to use `tsc` to transpile your server code.\n\n>I had a hard time outputting a dist folder when I ran¬†`watch:ts`¬†because I had¬†`\"noEmit\": true`¬†and¬†`\"emitDeclarationOnly\": true`¬†in my tsconfig.json file.\n\nIf you want to better understand each of the options in your `tsconfig.json`, I recommend [the official reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/). In general, official references for anything are always the most up-to-date, reliable, and comprehensive.\n\n>I get¬†`Named export 'SupabaseClient' not found. The requested module '@supabase/supabase-js' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.`¬†But my package.json has¬†`\"type\": \"module\"`, and tsconfig has¬†`\"module\": \"ESNext\",`¬†so why am I getting a commonJS error?¬†\n\nMake sure to read the error message very carefully. It is not saying that *your* code is CommonJS; it's saying that the Supabase package is CommonJS, and as a result, named imports might not work. ([MDN source if you're not familiar with what a named import is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#named_import))\n\nThis is pretty easy to fix ‚Äî since they don't want you using a named import, simply use a default import instead. If you want to understand why CommonJS modules might not support named imports, this is explained in [the Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#commonjs-namespaces).",

On the other hand, in build mode, the transformed code is written to disk.\n\n>Where can I read up on how the whole ecosystem works so I'm not running into one problem after another?

We'll skip Typescript for now.\n\nAll node.js projects are defined using a `package.json` file.  This file's primary purpose is to allow you to define the structure of libraries or applications you write.  If you ever publish an app or library to an external repository, such as npmjs.com, this file will be used by Node to work out which file bootstraps your code, what dependencies it requires, and so on.\n\nUsually, we aren't publishing packages, but we still use the `package.json` to manage dependencies, which are located in (and downloaded from) the npm repository by default.\n\nThe `package.json` file is managed by the `npm` command.  For example, `npm install` will install the dependencies listed in `package.json`.  `npm run` will run any script defined in the `scripts` property.  `npm test` will run your test suite, defined in the `scripts.test` property.  See the [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json) for a full breakdown of the file.\n\nDependencies are installed to the `node_modules` directory.\n\nIn the old days, modules were included in Node.js apps using a system called CommonJS, in which you export variables from modules by adding them as properties to an object called `exports` (e.g. `exports.bar = bar`).  You could then import it with `var bar = require('./foo').bar;`.  The path has to be relative for modules you define.  For dependencies installed via npm, it would be `require('foo')` to load the module from `node_modules/foo`.\n\nThe trouble with this approach is that you always had to import the entire module, even if you only needed one thing from it.  If that same module is imported multiple times throughout the code, that's a lot of redundant duplication; so ES modules were invented to allow you to import/export specific vars and only those vars (e.g. `import { bar } from 'foo'`).\n\nThis feature has to be enabled in Node.js before it will work.  I don't recall if it's backwards compatible with CommonJS or not, but the error you reported above (*The requested module '@supabase/supabase-js' is a CommonJS module*) suggests that either it doesn't, or it doesn't by default.\n\nI expect there will be a supabase package that does support esm, or a package that provides Typescript bindings.\n\nTypescript is a language that compiles (transpiles) to Javascript and has its own additional syntax.  It's described as a superset of Javascript, meaning that it should be able to read and understand JS, but I swear I've had issues running normal JS through the compiler in the past.  Anyway, Node only speaks JS, so you have to run your TS through the `tsc` Typescript compiler first.  In order to import dependencies into a TS programme, they must themselves either be TS, or be JS with TS bindings.  These bindings are located in files with the extension `.d.ts`.\n\nBindings exist for pretty much all popular dependencies now.\n\nI've not used Vite so I can't help you with that.\n\nHere's a simple config I wrote from scratch for an interview I had to prepare for recently (that never actually materialised).  The expectation was to do a live coding interview using Typescript and a setup of my choice.  I installed express and mocha just in case they wanted me to demonstrate unit testing and serving web content.\n\nHopefully it's simple enough to help you work out what everything does:\n\npackage.json\n\n    {\n      \"name\": \"y\",\n      \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n      \"description\": \"Practice for interview\",\n      \"license\": \"ISC\",\n      \"author\": \"\",\n      \"type\": \"esm\",\n      \"main\": \"main.js\",\n      \"scripts\": {\n        \"x\": \"node target/main.mjs\",\n        \"start\": \"tsx watch src/server.mts\",\n        \"test\": \"mocha\",\n        \"build\": \"tsc --module nodenext --outDir target src/main.mts\",\n        \"watch\": \"tsc --watch --module nodenext --outDir target src/main.mts\",\n        \"puzzle\": \"tsx src/puzzle.mts\"\n      },\n      \"devDependencies\": {\n        \"@types/chai\": \"^5.0.1\",\n        \"@types/express\": \"^5.0.0\",\n        \"@types/mocha\": \"^10.0.10\",\n        \"@types/node\": \"^22.13.0\",\n        \"chai\": \"^5.1.2\",\n        \"mocha\": \"^11.1.0\",\n        \"ts-node\": \"^10.9.2\",\n        \"tsx\": \"^4.19.2\"\n      },\n      \"dependencies\": {\n        \"express\": \"^4.21.2\"\n      }\n    }\n\n\ntsconfig.js\n\n    {\n      \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"target\": \"es2022\",\n        type: \"module\",\n        \"module\": \"node16\",                       \n        \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n        \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n        \"strict\": true,\n        \"skipLibCheck\": true\n      }\n    }",

        "body": "Got it. I don't know what the context is here -- and anything involving working with raw data is well above the level of this sub -- but the gist is probably this:\n\nYou have an HTML file, which contains a table presenting some text, two cells per row. The *tr* is the element for a row, the *td* the element for a [cell](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/td). Each of these cells has a class called \"datavalue,\" and from that HTML file, you could write a script that grabs everything out of any cell with the \"datavalue\" class, so you end up with a text string of \"003F00502040003F00502040\".... (I assume that there are also rows with 00, 04 , etc.)\n\nThe screenshot is a [hex editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor) of some kind -- I don't know which one but they basically all do the same thing: they open a file and let you directly see and edit the raw data. Right now you don't have the actual raw data, though, you have the text \"003F00502040003F00502040\" etc., so you'd have to convert that to the equivalent data file. (Don't worry about the specifics of that, there are probably built-in functions for it in whatever language you're using.)\n\nThen in the hex editor you can view what the bytes of the file are, where they are in the file, and what characters they would be if it was supposed to be readable text. This data is almost definitely not supposed to be text, but without more context I don't know what it's supposed to be. (i.e., the 00 3F and 00 50 are probably supposed to be 63 and 80, but I don't know exactly what the 63 and 80 are being used for.)\n\nAgain, all of this is very much above the level of this sub.",

Doing `cin >> text` when `text` is a `std::string` just reads a single word, defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters. The other words are left in the input buffer. So after first reading the word `\"Going\"`, then the next time you try to read an integer, the next word will be `\"to\"`, which can't be parsed as an integer, so it'll fail. And you're not checking for input parsing failures anywhere in your program.\n\nThe console output seems to indicate that your IDE has a debugger, so you should be able to use it to single-step through the code and see these kinds of problems for yourself.",

Sometimes a simple problem will take you a day, or two, or three, or however much until you figure out the solution. But taking that time to struggle with it is part of the learning process. So maybe just give yourself some more grace and time, and allow the problem to be absorbed in a much greater capacity.",

For technical skills someone typically is assigned to help mentor and onboard and teach you/docs to read etc. Having to mentor someones social skills is a lot more awkward and I doubt anyone wants to explicitly be told they need to do that. So a lot is on the individual if they know they need to grow that area and practice it themselves\n\nAnd then with technical skills there‚Äôs a lot of room to make mistakes and failsafes to catch you. With QA/canary/code review/rollbacks etc and even if a mistake makes it to prod typically it‚Äôs fine and a learning experience. Whereas in a social setting first impressions are very important. As you mentioned it can be awkward at first but unfortunately that impression can stick\n\nIt‚Äôs definitely not untrainable but trickier",

        "body": "I mean literally every post on Reddit tells you this lol.\n\nAnyway, I was always a weird nerd, hung around nerds, shy non-popular guys etc. But because I was always great at sport and athletic I would hang around jocks and even gangsters so I learned how to get along with alot of different people.\n\nThis is a big question so there's nowhere to start really but for Reddit I will say this, biggest killers for the guys here are the following: Introverted, self awareness and over-valuing intelligence. I can explain lol.\n\n1. Introverted: People use this as a self-built cage rather than just a label. It shouldn't even be a label the way this word has a mental hold on people on Reddit. Firstly, yes you can be naturally inclined toward introversion or extraversion, but there's caveats. Being introverted or extroverted doesn't neccessarily mean bad at social interaction versus good. I've seen plenty of extraverts who fucking suck at social situations and introverts who are great, they just prefer to be alone more often. You can be good at social skills and continue to carry your special little introvert label if you want, it's just going to be a little harder than if you were an extravert ***simply because you're getting in less reps.*** An extrovert will try and fail more = more chance for success. Also, you can switch between being introverted or extroverted, this isn't WoW where you can't cast a spell because you chose the paladin class. You're allowed to try being extroverted for a week, year, decade if you want.\n\nLike OP said it will feel weird at first, but ask any guy who got ripped from being fat if he felt like a natural in the gym the first day he picked up a weight. Nope, he worked through the pain and embarassment and got the reward. The good thing about social skills is that it doesn't even take that long, nor do you have to always be the social guy.. you can just learn the skills and keep it in your back pocket until you need it.\n\n2. Self awareness: Reddit copes alot by thinking that extraverts in engineering are just \"smooth talkers\" wrong. Smooth talking is a skill that comes with social skills, but it's not the whole pie. Some social people over-use smooth talking and get found out real quick and exposed, luckily here on Reddit we're all extremely intelligent and know what's best for the world so that won't be our issue... right?\n\nThere's a negative connotation in engineering for having good social skills and confidence. I get laughed at by my friends for having \"good english\" and \"talking shit\".. like that's something to be embarassed about? In reality, I have great language skills to explain things to people of all levels, and I can basically nail down concepts into managable pieces for customers to understand without confusing them with jargon.. that's a skill that requires intelligence, humility and understanding concepts. Engineering isn't just about calculating numbers really fast, or memorising a fourier transform, we're here to sell products and create ideas. You NEED to be able to communicate those ideas or else the math and physics is lost in the void. What's the point of being able to create nuclear power if the government is scared of it and thus bans it because you can't explain to them why it's neccessary. \n\n3. over-valuing intelligence: In the sense that people here like to min/max intel stats, that's great. More intelligence is always good, but again that's not a license for you to suck at conveying your ideas or to treat people like shit. Yes conceptually a team of really high intel nerds will be good for a company, but in reality we live in a market where we need to promote ideas and actually be able to understand from person to person. You can't do that by being very intelligent but a dick or can't explain your ideas to people in simple terms.",

You may not notice this much if you are young, single, and generally in good health, but its HUUGE when you have kids. I have twins.\n* the employee 'type' doesn't change how I engage w/ my coworkers - i'm a bit of a jokester and always try to lighten the mood, make work fun - to me that makes sense just cause, in theory i'm sitting next to you 8 hrs a day, i better like clocking in. But a lot of folks prefer keeping work & personal separate, that's totally fine too.\n* with regards to layoffs, generally in my exp contractors are 'first to go' of the engineers - not first to go like let go, they just don't renew your contract. A much bigger/critical layoff usually they cut ties with the staffing agency completely, i've seen.\n* for me it's all about stability, longevity, benefits. my contract ends just before december but i only recently started and i'm trying to bust my ass to get an extension / converted\n* not being eligible for some of the better FTE perks, sucks. Its like, I work just as much as any other person on the team, it'd be nice if i can be included in certain things \n\nThere's some things i like - like being held to 40 hrs a week, any overtime needs approval and you actually can get paid for it. generally that means i'm off the hook for pagerduty.

I have always preferred FTE in the past because you get the good salary, there is no waiting to see if you get extended, the benefits will be better, you get PTO, and paid holidays.  And who knows, you might even get a bonus, and a promotion.   Who knows!\n\nI seemed to fall into temporary contract work when FTE positions were not available.   I never minded doing some contract work.   I didn't worry about office politics like the OP said.   In some cases, I got holiday pay and even bonuses from some contracting companies.   But what I didn't like was short term extensions.   I worked for one client who did first 6 months, then another 6 months, and then it was 3 months, and then 3 months.   I had to leave.    I told my manager, who was a great person BTW, that I simply can't keep extending for 3 months.   As soon as you start the 3 months, you need to start looking again halfway through ... if you;re going to extend me, at least make it for some length of time, but I know she didn't control the money, so that was that.\n\nNowadays, I've been getting laid off a lot, the FTE roles don't seem to last very long themselves.  Yeah, you might get some extra benefits from FTE, but longevity isn't one of them.     I definitely have friends who have been contracting at one client for years and years, they have been around longer than most FTE employees.  They just keep getting extended, and they know the work, and it's not hard.    \n\nSo, pros and cons for each ..........",

And this is super risky but I‚Äôd probably still do it, whatever certs you are aiming for, put them on your resume already and spam that resume out there.  Try to think of any of that type of devops work you were exposed to in your career even if briefly, and highlight it on a second version of your resume and use that to target devops roles.  \n\nUse your current resume with your it skills and spam those out for any it roles.  It is taking forever to get interviews these days, just assume you‚Äôll have time to complete the certs before you get the interview and cram studying for those things.\n\nOne other suggestion, you can use ChatGPT for questions like this and it does an amazing job of telling you the possibilities and also generating a step by step plan‚Ä¶ give it a shot!",

I bought a copy of Microsoft Visual C++ and learned the language (as you said, it's extremely easy to pick up a new language or framework - nowadays, you don't even have to buy anything!)\n\nBut I didn't have any on-the-job experience, either, and self-taught didn't mean anything.\n\nSo... I didn't _lie_ about actual on-the-job C++ experience.  I never said \"so-and-so paid me to work on C++\".  But there's a lot of stretching you can do to the truth and keep it the truth, assuming you've actually put in the time to really learn the subject.\n\nI'm not giving you any _specific_ advice here, just sharing a completely unrelated story from 30 years ago.",

It's always been like this and probably always will be, because *ML work is difficult to evaluate from the outside*.\n\n* From the POV of someone not deeply familiar with ML, it's hard to distinguish ourselves from people less qualified, who might be liable to commit rookie data leakage/confounding/etc mistakes, and be none the wiser until the model is in production. Without stars and citations, GitHub repos and arXiv papers are laborious to evaluate and are indistinguishable from slop.\n* Our work inevitably requires some research, which usually doesn't pan out. If a manager makes a bad hire, and they're not competent in ML themselves, they have to wait through a long string of failures in order to decide \"okay this person is incompetent\" and finally fire him.\n\nSo hiring managers have to be very, very careful. In such murky circumstances, it's rational to resort to costly social signals. Publications in conferences, placements in Kaggle competitions, and of course experience at prestigious companies are reliable signals of competence, only because they are so costly to fake. They'd rather overpay for a highly-qualified candidate (not you or me) than gamble on someone less-credentialed who passed their interview (which they know isn't terribly high-signal to begin with).\n\nThis is all many times more extreme for researchers, for whom a PhD is mandatory.\n\n>But i see people doubling their salaries all with just taking a single course on basic ML....how???\n\nThis would be news to me.",

Like, you know, fortune striking them at just the right moments.\n\nTake Steve Jobs as an example. People often point out that he was poor, which is true, but he also got some extraordinary breaks that almost nobody gets. He met Wozniak, who happened to be a genius at building computers, at exactly the right time. Woz let Jobs run with the business side, they launched their first product, it took off immediately, and suddenly Jobs was financially independent. Apple went on an upward spiral so fast he never really saw any serious failure early in his life. That kind of alignment is rare.\n\nIf you‚Äôre coming from very humble beginnings, you usually need multiple strokes of luck like that to become extremely successful. Getting to moderate success or financial independence is possible with hard work, but the billionaire-level outcomes are much harder without serious tailwinds.\n\nFinance and tech both show this in different ways. Finance is even more network-heavy. Running a fund is all about raising money, and raising money is basically a game of connections. Technology is also about contacts in the Valley when it comes to big fundraising rounds, but the barrier to entry can be lower.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre poor, you can still make it, but you‚Äôll need a lot of luck. Even if you claw your way up, the climb is steeper. No contacts, no capital, and no safety net mean it will take much longer to reach the same level as someone who started with connections.",

        "body": "  \nI've been on both sides of this. I started my career as an 'ambitious overachiever,' burned out hard, and then tried the 'maintain boundaries' approach. Here's what I learned.  \n**As an Ambitious Overachiever:**  \nFrom my personal experience, going above and beyond only **works if you're able to \"showcase\" your work.** That is, people in the company need to actively **see you as someone who goes \"above and beyond\"** in order for it to matter. You should also make sure to **document your achievements and positive feedback** received so you can later present them to management when discussing raises, promotions, and so on. I would also say, though this is also another personal experience thing, that **going above and beyond in every category is both ineffective and leads to burnout.** It's better to **have one project which you own/lead and excel** **at** at a time, and do the \"regular\" amount of work on your other projects.  In addition, it is important to build rapport. You don't have to be an extrovert per se, but **people should leave feeling positively after talking with you.** \n\nOn the downside, **career progression** at any one company inherently **depends on how much room there is for promotion** and the budget of your department. Plus, overperformance makes you advance faster but rarely do you ever skip progression tiers. You may be a truly stellar, outstanding, junior engineer, but you won't get promoted to senior engineer immediately. You'll likely just spend one year less in junior, one year less in mid, and so on. It also only partially protects you from layoffs--**you'll be the last junior engineer laid off**, but if they're **laying off all junior engineers you're still gonna get laid off.**\n\nSomething I learned the hard way is that no matter how much of a \"go above and beyond\" employee you are, **one period of poor performance**, even if do to extenuating circumstances, **can very quickly destroy your reputation** as an overperformer. If this happens, you should immediately look for a new job unless you really love your current workplace. I also found that **opportunities to truly excel can be difficult to find and sometimes even be gatekept.**\n\nIt is important to remember that much of **your excellent performance will evaporate** when searching for a new job **unless you're able to show public artifacts** which showcase it. Maybe references can do this too, but you need to tell the new employer to actually contact them. I got laid off without any public artifacts to show off, and it made job searching ***much harder.***\n\n**Do great work but maintain boundaries approach:**\n\nI took this approach after burning out, though that burnout was partly due to a toxic coworker.  \nI found it to be less stressful and often my outcomes became more consistent, which many employers value more than someone who does overall better work but in an inconsistent fashion. In general, it's only seen as a bad thing at (healthy) companies if it's the kinda role where overtime is inherently expected or a startup. How your work itself is recognized largely depends on your manager and how well they understand it. I'd say your manager's **subjective perception of your work matters far more than the actual work quality.**\n\n**Advancement** felt like it **depended** more **on the state the economy**. Good economy, relatively normal advancement rate. Bad economy, slower advancement rate and layoffs. \n\n**Summary/takeaway:**\n\nBrute-force 'tryharding' is rarely worth the investment and often leads to burnout. If there's a project you can take ownership over, do that and make sure to 'show it off' like a salesman.  Make sure to have evidence to support your skills for both internal promotions and getting jobs elsewhere. **Be an intelligent, strategic achiever who works to own and lead projects while building the skillset you want, rather than an overachiever for the company you work for.**",

The question should be more nuanced though- people (especially engineers) LOVE to microoptimize on a single variable when that isn't actually productive because our lives are multifaceted (e.g. either minmaxing saving money, or being a yolo spender).¬†\nMy practical recommendations are 2 things\n1) oscillate based on priority. Some projects are important, high-vis, high-impact and will leapfrog your career more than the rest of your work combined. Spending a bit more effort here pays dividends. Similarly, if you're close to a promo you care about, it's worth doing a bit extra. Rest of the time, it's okay to just do enough.\n\n\n2) understand the rubric better. Unlike school where assignments are graded 0-100%, work is very ambiguous. Understand who controls your career trajectory (usually your direct manager and maybe skip level), and optimize for success. Find ways to proactively make your manager's job easier, and make your manager look good to their management. This will do the most.¬†\n\n\nOne anecdote I've shared a few times: I grinded really hard when I joined this job, manager denied my promo again and again based on random nitpicks from career ladder doc. I eventually threw in the towel and said fuck it, that manager left, my new manager was chill and I kept sandbagging. I'd be responsive and helpful on shared projects, but I was also literally playing video games during the day (wfh). Despite all this, my new manager pretty soon put me up for promo successfully without me asking, and handwaved a bunch of career ladder \"requirements\". I did have to do a bit of extra work since manager asked me to draft my own promo doc (usually manager duty, but fair enough trade lol). It's all fuzzy and hand wavey end of day as long as those in charge approve¬†",

        "body": "Its social media. Humans within a social circle (that now encompasses the world) likes to show-off and brag. However, based on what you wrote, you and many others have been both mislead and duped by these influencers. Many influencers show off a lavish life style funded by millions of dollars in debt. They aren't rich by any means. Only faking it.\n\n>I‚Äôve noticed that in tech communities especially software engineering, there‚Äôs a lot of emphasis on talking about compensation packages, benefits, and perks. You see it everywhere from ‚ÄúDay in the Life‚Äù YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.\n\nTech encompasses a wide range of compensation, benefits and perks. What you see on social media is the top 10% of all tech. It would look completely different - perhaps even bleak, if someone actually showed the day in the life of a median (50th percentile) or worst (100th percentile) job.\n\nThey certainly don't have free lunches, nap pods, and may be even lucky if they get free coffee. They might be filling out time-sheets and staring down some of the worst-maintained technology with very strict deadlines and constraints for changes. Depending on the country, the median can range anywhere from $40K-80K. Does that sound super cushy to you?\n\n>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs¬†*can*¬†be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the¬†*only*¬†field with these kinds of perks, which isn‚Äôt true.\n\nDo you really get why this happens?\n\nBased off of your perspective you don't. The phenomenon is more broadly categorized as \"keeping up with the jones\" within the last century. Only with the internet it has allowed people to share their accomplishments across a larger audience that would not have been possible before.\n\nPreviously such people would only be able to reach as far as people similarly within their economic circle. People irrespectively have been comparing themselves to others within their social circle for millennia. The rich compared themselves with other rich. The poor compared themselves to other poor. The middle class compared themselves to other middle class. Its competition, its standard human nature that we haven't grown out of.\n\nThe internet and more specifically Social Media has given everyone a microphone to broadcast themselves.\n\n>There are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:\n\nAny job can be cushy if you're in the right positions. But your perspective is off-keel and your barking up the wrong trees. Within ALL professions, there is the top, middle, and bottom. What you see on social media being \"cushy\" jobs is nothing more than a facade - including in the industries you mentioned. They are designed to spark envy.\n\nMany of these high paying jobs are not \"cushy\" in the slightest - at least if people are actually performing their job. These so-called benefits only exist to extract more work hours out of staff. You get subjected to the political machinations resulting from the Jack Welsh Rank-And-Yank (the Hunger Games).",

        "body": "For anyone wanting a career in anything, it is very important to highlight your accomplishments for this very reason. Keep conversations up with your manager (ask for skip level 1v1s) to ensure you stay in communication so your manager can continue to gauge how you are doing vs. what your lead is saying. That then allows your manager to know how to work with the lead to make them a better leader as well. It is not being arrogant when you say I‚Äôve worked on this and this and this and these are the outcomes. If you mess up, own it and say I learned my lesson and don‚Äôt do Y again. That goes a long way and gains lots of respect, which helps with stability.\nIt doesn‚Äôt hurt to put feelers out there for other jobs, but each job has his own crap to deal with. I would evaluate the opportunities you have and get vs. this lead being a pain. This lead may not be here for forever either. If the lead is your only problem, do skip level 1v1s and go from there. Remember, everyone is learning. The lead, yes is being not a great lead, but likely it‚Äôs their first time being a leader and trying to figure it out and needs some guidance. Just like you when you first started. Try to highlight the wins with the lead too! Maybe that will get them thinking more positively as well. And maybe the lead is thinking of you as more senior than you are due to the work you are doing. So reminding them how young in your career you are can help.\nRegarding leaving the field, this is more of a corporate life issue than the field. I deal with this in cybersecurity (got a degree in compsci so why follow) too. You will run into these issues no matter what field you are in. Unfortunately school doesn‚Äôt teach you how to traverse corporate life. I say it sounds like you are doing a great job and have a lot of opportunities to grow. Do skip level 1v1s with your manager, communicate what work you are doing and the outcomes with both your lead and manager, and see what happens. Best of luck to you!",

It's difficult to tell the difference between early career and experienced commenters, and good advice is often counter intuitive. \n\nThere are two pieces of bad advice I am constantly trying to correct. First is learning more skills won't lead you to being overworked. People complain about the rising popularity of full stack development. They say they refuse to learn frontend or backend because that will just lead to your employer expecting you to do two jobs. That's not true. Learning more skills will make you more efficient at your job, saving you time. It will also make you more competitive on the job market, meaning it will be easier for you to find a job with good WLB. There's more than enough dedicated frontend or backend work. If an employer is going to overwork you, they're going to do it regardless if you know full stack or not.\n\nSecond is becoming more senior destroys your WLB. That's again not true. The things that destroy your WLB are getting a senior title before your ready and getting a senior title at a mismanaged company. Some people get thrust into a tech lead role 3 years into their career. These people are usually stressed AF because they don't have the experience to do it effectively, and the fact that they were promoted means the average level of experience is lower then theirs. That means they're going to be even more stressed trying to bail out all of the people on their team, because they also don't have the experience to do their jobs effectively. Don't try to avoid promotions. Avoid premature promotions and take on a senior/tech lead title when you feel comfortable you can do the job in <40 hours per week.",

I have only ever seen a company's butt tighten up like a snare drum when it comes to spending money on someone, i.e. promotion, training, etc. This whole idea of the company needs to value you or needs to encourage you, that's not the aim of the game for most companies.\n\nAnd to people who just want to say, \"I guess you worked for shitty companies\", 85 or so in so far, I've yet to see it any different. If yours is different, let me know how to apply! Even the nicest of places to work get fidgety when you tell them you've gone done achieved something big that's worth a lot more on the job market. That goes double if there's someone already in the position you're working towards.\n\nAny promotion means a move.

Unfortunately I can‚Äôt say these worries were fully unfounded but things didn‚Äôt turn out nearly as bad as the grey beards liked to complain about.\n\nLLMs are so new that we don‚Äôt have a lot of ‚Äútips and tricks‚Äù built up so unfortunately I don‚Äôt have much in the way of practical advice beyond just developing your personal discipline.\n\nA couple of things I think you can try:\n\n- Use screen time limits to restrict access to the LLM apps and sites you use\n  - My thinking here is you can‚Äôt go cold turkey but you can time limit and make its extended use impractical\n- Switch search engines away from Google to something like DuckDuckGo or Kagi. For compsci/tech I recommend Kagi and I think they have a student plan\n  - My thinking here is a) googles quality has declined and b) their Gemini integration is too hard to avoid\n- Consider timeboxing algo learning/studying on pen and paper away from your computer and phone.\n  - Basically try like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do an hour w/o internet and see how far I get and then give myself X minutes after to research any questions I have‚Äù\n  - Look up ‚Äúpomodoro timers‚Äù if you haven‚Äôt heard of them yet that technique is hepful for focus\n- Any time an LLM does generate an answer, commit yourself to finding a non-LLM source that confirms the answer\n  - Don‚Äôt ask the LLM to cite sources, go find a source by hand. At least here you build up your researching skills even if you‚Äôre worried the LLM reliance prevented you from learning the core subject. That‚Äôs honestly more important anyways. \n\nRealistically the skills you need to build here are being able to go to articles and documentation to build an understanding. Memorizing a red-black tree algo is less important than knowing what they are, why they are useful, and how to find and evaluate a source that you can use to remind yourself of implementation.\n\nMy last bit of advice is don‚Äôt beat yourself up when you ‚Äúfall off the wagon‚Äù. LLMs are so new and temptingly useful *enough* that we don‚Äôt know as an industry/discipline how to deal with their impacts and deficits. We‚Äôre learning by observing your generation, sadly. Learning ‚Äúthe old ways‚Äù is important not necessarily because they‚Äôre better but because those charting the new way of doing things have to know where we came from in order to guide us to where we‚Äôre going.",

They're posting there for a reason. And there will *always* be someone underbidding you. People are willing to do a ton of work for pennies on the dollar of what it's worth purely so they have something to put on their resume/portfolio. Even US devs. On top of that, people living in extremely LCOL countries can afford to underbid everyone and still live comfortable lives.\n\nFreelancing isn't easy. The best way to get clients is through word of mouth, self-advertising, or applying directly to contracting/freelancing postings from large companies. Not using a platform where millions of people are fighting for the same posting, and the people using said platform are looking for the cheapest option.",

What has thrown things off this time was that the last big economic downturn was in 2008 and that all the chaos around the pandemic extended the already longer than average cycle. Basically, you can't assume that conditions now, good or bad, will stay static and this applies to not only the economy as a whole but to companies as well. Don't count on stability, instead, stay prepared for instability.\n\nWhat would I do different if I was starting out now?

Most companies need solid, reliable people who show up and do the work without drama.\n\nBut yeah, if you're already burnt out on applications and not feeling the field, might be worth exploring those other \"nice\" jobs you mentioned. No shame in pivoting if it gets you where you want to be faster. The market sucks right now anyway, so bulk applying with auto apply tools might be smarter than grinding out individual apps.

I'm too old to put up with that shit, the market being bad wasn't relevant in my decision to start looking for a new job.\n\nI prep very lightly for about a month. I'm not targetting FAANG, or anything insane where you get tossed leetcode hards back to back. I do practice *some* leetcode, but a lot of my prep is refreshing fundamentals, system design, language-specific quirks, behavioral, etc. I only really spend 30-60 minutes a day, sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes not at all. My goal is to not burnout on the job search itself, so I'm not forcing anything.\n\nI had 11 YOE at the time, so I was applying to Senior / Staff roles. It took me just under 3 months, and 82 applications. All of them were cold applications online.\n\nTips for those struggling.... you need to be able to identify which part of the process is breaking down, and actively try to fix it. Don't just repeat the same exact thing that isn't working and expect it to suddenly start working.\n\nIf you're getting literally no interviews, the problem is your resume. Hard stop. A lot of people read a bunch of resume advice, get people to review it online, even pay professionals to review it, and then just assume their resume can't be the problem after all of that.\n\nWell, the proof's in the pudding. If you're not getting interviews, it's your resume. So instead of blindly believing your resume is good, look into some differing advice. There's the \"meta advice\" you'll get on this subreddit (impact, KPI's, etc), but there's *lots* of different approaches to resume writing. Try some conflicting advice, and build a 2nd resume from that. Maybe even build a 3rd or a 4th all using different strategies that disagree with each other. Then A/B test those resumes. This is something I did in the middle of my job search because I had a hunch one of my titles was hurting me, so I started using 2 versions of my resume.\n\nIf you're not struggling to get interviews, consider yourself lucky. It's much easier to improve on whatever interview techniques you're struggling with. Reflect, be honest with yourself where you're weak, and work to improve whatever that is. And don't sleep on the behavioral/communication aspect of interviewing, it can be hard to point the finger back at yourself and say you're not doing a good job at communicating, but you need to be able to be introspective.",

And you're in the PERFECT position to be moving across the country because you are not tied down (you might *think* your family/gf is tying you down, but they're not).

Focus on mid-tier companies that actually value your automation testing background - lots of places need that skill combo.\n\nIf you're dead set on big tech interviews though, I'd recommend preparing with some mock interview tools. I've done the same - at least for someone like me who gets anxious a lot, they really help. There are multiple tools available, I used Final Round AI's mock interview and it's quite good.",

My short opinion is \"yes, but a bubble doesn't mean the technology is worthless\". \n\nRight now what most people call \"AI\"  (which is really just a small subset of generative AI) is almost definitely in a bubble. There's an unbelievable amount of investment in it, a ton of business ventures that use it without a clear plan or analysis, and a lot of integration in places where it doesn't add much value.  There are also a lot of people banking on it doing things in the future that it doesn't do right now, and putting money into it based on an assumption that \"it'll do everything we need soon\".\n\nThere's also an issue at the very top. Companies that provide the service are not making money off it yet, and they will need to either raise their prices or lower their costs to make it profitable in the future. They're all hoping to win a market share and then hike up the prices. This is disastrous for businesses which are, by-and-large, planning as though their current rates will be stable forever.\n\nUnlike blockchain/crypto, however, AI does show many profitable use-cases. AI does work that would cost money, and it provides services people will pay for. Business analyses DO show that AI is successfully being used by businesses sometimes. It's just that most businesses don't know what works or doesn't work, and are using the technology blindly.\n\nI would liken it to the \"Dotcom Bubble\". The internet as a business technology was absolutely in a bubble in the 90s, and that bubble crashed. It wasn't because \"having a website for your business\" was a bad idea, it was because people were trying to do it without a good plan. Nowadays every business has a website, but unlike the 90s we've established clear use cases which provide value instead of just guessing what works and what doesn't.\n\nI expect AI to be the same. AI will \"crash\". There will be downtime where a lot of businesses disappear, and from the ashes will rise a few clear uses where generative AI is used by almost every business.",

Whether you would call that a bubble depends on what you think will happen when the market for the technology moves beyond hype into a mature, useful stage. There are many realistic and valuable business applications for LLMs, computer vision, etc. These tools are incredibly powerful and will only get better as the models get refined and as more skilled developers work on them (whether they are newly trained in an ML-specific context, like me, or they're crossing over from more rigorous, traditional SWE backgrounds).\n\n\nI'm currently a manager in a non-technical role but taking point on some exploratory AI projects, and I'm looking for a role as an ML engineer down the road. What I'm paying attention to, both in my current role and in my job search, is whether the product brings real business value. Investors and execs don't understand this stuff, they see how quickly and confidently chatgpt spits out text and they believe it's magic that's going to relieve them of the burden of workers. Dishonest hype men are more than happy to take advantage of that.¬†\n\n\nBut if you actually understand how these models work on even a rudimentary technical level then you can smell the bullshit from a mile away. I'm not going to peddle bullshit and I'm not going to go work for bullshit except as a last resort. I think that very few companies can survive selling bullshit (though some do) but I won't be surprised to see a lot of snake oil AI startups go under in the next few years, so I don't want to bank on that for my future.",

I can figure out business logic on my own, I can talk to other engineers, I've always worked at places that had good processes in-place so asking my manager for a Jira ticket would be unheard of.\n\nWhat I expect from my managers is to handle politics, handle cross-team dependencies/conversations, planning, negotiating between product and engineering, etc. I want them operating at a level above me, above the individual. They're there to protect us from external stakeholders, and unblock us from external dependencies.\n\nSo that's why I'm curious what exactly you mean by \"ghost manager\". If I don't *see* or *speak* to my manager in weeks, not a big deal. They're still doing the job I expect of them behind the scenes.

That's part of how the newbies learn the and the employers see what sort of potential the newbies have; they aren't going to throw huge component rewrites at someone who hasn't proven they're useful and in it for the long haul.\n\nIt's also pretty much always been a stressful field; back when I started the running joke was that the halflife of a computer geek in industry was about seven years; a lot of folks burn out fast.",

If you have a medical facility near you, any communities related to them are also a good place to look because a lot of doctors have nannies. New residents and med students with kids in particular may be looking to nanny share to save some money. \n\nYour other option is to aggresively consolidate your day and hire in-home help for that time. For example, make your working hours 9AM-1PM (or whatever). Find a part time nanny who is willing to do 4 hours per day. Then tell work that your hours for meetings and other syncronous work have shifted into that mid-day block or to hours when your husband is home. \n\nBoth of these options, a nanny share or a part time nanny, will run you a similar cost to high quality infant daycare, but will keep your child from getting sick with all of the daycare sicknesses. It's also better for babies that small to be home. Group care is just not the best option for that age, so if you can avoid it, you should.

        "body": "People here have good advice but I'll tell you my story as it's very similar to yours. Advice at the end.\n\nSome background here: My wife and I had twins 4.5 months ago. My wife is a PM at a startup (she has anywhere from 2-4 hours of meetings a day), I'm a senior dev at a more established company (I have 30 minutes of meetings per day), and we both WFH full time. Also, I often can get away with working 10 hour weeks but the occasional crunch time for a project means I'm working 40 hours. My wife had \\~3 months of maternity leave and I had 2 weeks of PTO that I used all up front when the babies were born. Ours were also underbaked (lol) at 37 weeks which is actually full term for twins. Our twins for the first \\~4 months were also EXTREMELY clingy and could not be put down. We we wearing them almost all hours of the day.\n\nOur original plan was to attempt to balance them between meetings and work - we thought this might be feasible since my meeting schedule is so light and my working hours are extremely flexible.\n\nTowards the end of my wife's maternity leave, we realized things were only getting harder with the twins. On days where I happen to have a few extra meetings and she does as well (nearly every day for her) we really didn't have a backup plan other than 2 screaming babies behind me on camera or me skipping meetings. \n\nSo in the final week before she went back to work, we hired a nanny who came to our house to watch the babies from 9-2. That offered us enough time to get things down and squeeze our meetings into this time window and then do any work we needed to follow up with later in the evening. Even this was not a very sustainable lifestyle as we found ourselves far too often working into the night when we were exhausted from taking care of twins most of the day. Our nanny didn't end up working out - she was unable to care for the babies as they needed a caretaker who had more energy (you can read my previous posts for more context here) so we ended up letting her go a few weeks ago and we are currently on week 3 of working while taking care of the twins. Let me tell you, it is extremely difficult. I take meetings in my airpods with screaming babies and then run out of the room to give my scrum update and then immediately after (2 min later) run back into the room to continue looking after them. I take meetings on walks. I cram as much work into their short nap windows as I possibly can. My wife and I both work late into the night to make it work. It is HARD. I would not wish it on anyone.\n\nMy wife just put in her 2 weeks notice and work and I just landed a new job that gives me a raise to cover enough of her loss in comp that we should be fine for her to just be full time SAHM for now.\n\nTLDR;\n\nMy situation is slightly different than yours - 2 WFH parents with 2 babies. But I think you also will find (especially with your heavy meeting load) that it's just not sustainable. You might make it work for a few weeks but inevitably you'll find that you can't dedicate enough effort to either work or your baby and likely both will suffer for it.\n\nMy advice would be to spend the time now (before you go back to work) finding people in your network/community/neighborhood who would be interested in nanny sharing and then find ways if possible to reduce spending in other areas of your life to free up some funds for this. It's not going to be easy. But it will likely be SO MUCH easier than trying to do everything yourself.\n\nDM me or I can put you in contact with my wife if you have any questions!",

Luckily we found an amazing daycare with teachers and staff we trust. Our daughter adjusted really easily - it even helped her establish a good schedule and nap in a crib! We truly consider daycare as part of our \"village.\"\n\nI hope you have an amazing remainder of maternity leave and soak up all those sweet snuggles.

Very often, the outcomes are simply correlated with socioeconomic factors.\n\n>I have had a couple coworkers (admittedly more in project management type roles) tell me just keep the baby at home for the first year! It'll be fine! I just don't understand how that's gonna work.\n\nIt won't work unless you're okay neglecting your kid, job, or both. And don't expect to be able to do it for many years, unless you're content with sticking your kid in front of a screen for hours each day.\n\n> Has anyone successfully taken care of a baby while in a technical role like this? \n\nNope.

They can even say \"Great!\" and not be lying, because what a \"Good WLB\" is is very subjective. They may genuinely think their WLB is great because they only have you working 60 hours instead of 80.\n\nSo instead, ask them about stories. In the exact same way they use \"tell me about a time when...\" questions on *you* to gain insight into *you* as opposed to directly asking. \"When was the last time the team was missing a deadline, and how was that handled?\", \"How are deadlines decided, and who decides on them?\", \"When do most people generally come in/leave for the day?\", \"When's the last time the team got an after hours support call and how was that handled?\", \"What's considered 'crunch time', and how often is the team doing that?\", \"What are your expectations of \\[role\\]?\", etc, etc.\n\nThere are many, many different answers to those questions. It's up to you to decide if you think their answer demonstrates the kind of WLB/culture you're willing to join.\n\nIf from any of the questions it sounds like this is a \"work hard play hard\" team, you reject them.\n\nI've worked for 2 startups, and they had amazing WLB's. I joined them *because* of that, it wasn't a surprise after-the-fact. Almost all of my reverse interview questions are focused on WLB/culture. Not all startups will make you burn the midnight oil.",

My advice: take a look at the Blind/Grind 75 and try doing as many of those as possible.

Is it a BFS or DFS search tree problem? Dynamic programming? Greedy algorithm? Recursion? Hash table or heap? Once you get the hang of identifying that part quickly, the actual coding becomes a lot easier, and interviewers will be more lenient on your actual whiteboarding because you will have at least demonstrated you know what the problem is asking for.",

Your brain is not as \"plastic\" as it once was, so you will need time to get this stuff locked in (and that is OK).\n\nThe way I'd go about it is to seriously try the Leetcode Easy. Why Easy? Because a lot of the Mediums are generalizations of Easy problems, and the Easy problems give you a good foundation of key techniques.\n\nOnce you find a solution to an Easy, take around 10-15 minutes and think if you can find a faster solution. On Leetcode it is usually to tell if there is a faster solution by the speed/memory distribution.\n\nOnce you get the hang of Easys, then start doing Mediums that are semi-related to the Easys you've done. (For example, if you did an Easy in strings, do some Mediums in strings. If you did Easies in arrays, do some Mediums in arrays.) Your mind will be somewhat attuned to possible patterns and techniques.\n\nWRT AI... please don't. People will find out. If they don't find out then, they will find out at the interview when they make you code in front of them. And once recruiters find out, they tell other recruiters privately that this candidate used AI. Even if you somehow make it, you'll be miserable. You will have a case of impostor syndrome that you've never believed can exist. You will know inside that you're way above where you are, because the work will be assigned based on the AI version of you, not you. And if you think you can use AI at work... sure, I'm sure people will not mind as much, but you will NOT be happy in that role.\n\nEDIT: A lot of ppl have some flavor of what I said. I wanted to add. Please make sure you know basic Data structures (Arrays, Lists, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, Hash tables) and Algorithms (Sorting, Binary search, divide and conquer, BFS, DFS, Binary Search Trees and Tree Traversals, etc).",

Stop testing yourself on stuff you haven't practiced yet.\n\nLearn the concepts and ideas behind \"algorithms and data structures\". Actually make sure you understand what it is about, how things work in principle. Then start practicing. Do not try to solve as many questions as you can, but look at a question, understand it, and work your way not just to a solution, but to understanding what it does, and why, and how, and explain why that is better than sub-optimal alternatives.\n\nOnce you're good at that, you should have very few problems with leetcode anymore.\n\nThere are problems that you'll absolutely have to memorize. Dijkstra's algorithm is named after the dude because it is nothing short of brilliant. I know I am not that clever, so I won't come up with that solution to that problem. but i don't have to memorize how to scan an array for the largest value, because I actually understand what is going on, any way,  and can rebuild the solution when it is needed.\n\n\\*: Fun fact, chicken sexing is one weird exception that nobody has an explanation for yet.

I also think the miniature painting hobby is pretty opaque when you first start out, and my hope is that once it's all said and done it will be genuinely useful for new folks who want to understand that term they've seen thrown around reddit constantly but never explained. It's nice to be working on something that I actually care about, rather than doing a thing for the sake of it!",

You can't really drill these like you would technical coding questions, but you can practice explaining your thought process out loud and getting comfortable with saying \"I'm not sure, but here's how I'd approach it.\"\n\nJane Street's bar is high and they're looking for a specific type of analytical thinking that either clicks with you or doesn't. But the uplifting part is that if you've made it to round three, they already see potential in you. Focus on being genuinely curious about the problems they present, don't be scared to ask questions, and show them how your mind works rather than trying to guess the \"right\" answer. The topics can range from basic probability and statistics to market dynamics, so having a solid foundation there helps, but your reasoning process matters more than perfect recall of formulas.\n\nI'm on the team behind [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help with these kinds of challenging interview scenarios where you need to think on your feet and articulate complex reasoning clearly.",

Started at 75k and worked my way to about 90k (not a huge bump but defense doesnt pay that crazy). I decided to jump ship during the last hiring boom of covid. Ended up at a big tech company (one of the bigger ones) for 200k TC. I took it without even thinking. \n\nDefense - i loved my co-workers and was moving up the latter quickly. It was so chill and the work was fun and easy. I did 20 hours of work and chilled the rest of the week. I was my team's scrum master and developer and i didnt think about work after 5 pm and was a top performer. There werent any real deadlines and i could sit on a task for 2 months and nobody complained. \n\nBig tech - things got hectic quickly. I was working for their cloud service. What i didnt know is that cloud is where work life balance goes to die. At first i wanted to respet my balance and stuck to 40 hour weeks for the most part. Then it slowly got more and more hectic and since i was remote id idnt realize my coworkers were pulling 50-60 hour weeks sometimes mroe. so after a year i obviously was behind the rest and even if my work was to my standards, they compared me to my coworkers standards and i got less than average. I drank the kool aid for a year and worked like crazy. Matched the 50-60 hours but i realzied i just didnt lvoe the work but the economy was shit so i kept it going. After a year i got another bad review and a few months later fired. \n\nIm not saying dont take AWS, for the money it sounds amazing. You might have a way better experience than i did. I know someone who works for AWS, has 300k+ in TC and it's one of the easier AWS projects where people sign off at 5pm and dont think about work. They dont even have on-call.  You could land ion a project like that or you could land in a project that requires 80 hours from you in tough weeks. \n\nIm just saying sometimes the fame and fortune isnt what it lives up to be. You need to decide if you will be ok with the potential burnout. Also it's not always you will find a job with coworkers you like.",

If you were 40 with kids, then the conversation would be different IMO.\n\nHere are some comments where I left my take on Amazon if you're interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h50k4u/comment/m02giyu/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h50k4u/comment/m02giyu/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h50k4u/comment/m07uk19/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h50k4u/comment/m07uk19/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",

If employer is paying for then still fine, is an accomplishment you can list on a resume. But they're not paying so you better pass.\n\n>Are more AWS certs or other certs worth it?\n\nNo. I almost say AWS is worthless but I worked at a company that liked seeing AWS Associate. I didn't have it or any AWS experience and was hired since I used Azure at my last job. The cloud certs are the only ones I ever see and only about 10% of the time. Less relevant for that 10% if the company uses 1 of the other 2. So you see, low value but not zero.\n\nRest of certs are scams.\n\n*How do you stand out more after graduating?*\n\n1. Work experience. Nice if the job is a similar industry. List technology you used on the job because no one wants to train you. Make the hiring manage believe you can make significant contributions with minimal training. Easy to get the chance if they like you resume.\n2. Greater than 1 YoE, resume can be 1 or 2 pages, or 1.5 is okay white space kind of looks bad. Use a big font if 2 pages. Honestly, big font is underrated. Eye tracking surveys you can search for show HR reads you resume for less than 8 seconds. Don't make it an adjective fiesta. I list the tech stacks both in the job descriptions and in a separate section at the bottom for ease of reading.\n3. A select few companies like seeing community involvement such as volunteering. Can attend young professionals events and maybe make friends at companies that are hiring. Adult kickball leagues, I know multiple married couples that met on teams.\n4. Sounds obvious but be within driving distance of the office. I don't list my full address, just City, State, Zipcode. Remote jobs all well and good but those get the most applicants. Almost every company I know went back to 3-4 days in the office.\n\n>still managed to hit \\~120 applications. No job still.\n\nIn 4 months, that is slack. 10 applications a day = 300 a month is still slack. You have no idea how overcrowded CS is. Pick it up.",

Only do to teach yourself tech stacks and stay sharp for coding tests. Don't spend hours polishing to share.\n\nCoding tests are practical for 495 out of the Fortune 500.

Being expected to figure things out on your own in a small team is actually pretty common in consulting. A lot of firms put people on islands where they have to be the expert, even if they‚Äôre still learning. It‚Äôs not a bad thing but it also means you haven‚Äôt had the chance to see how larger dev teams work day to day. \n\nYour role ties with Cloud Engineer or Cloud + Automation Engineer fits well. If you want to move toward joining a dev team, you could focus more on backend development with Python frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django) and data tools, while still using your cloud knowledge to stand out. If you want to stay close to infrastructure, doubling down on Azure certifications and automation tools would make you stand out as a cloud engineer. If you‚Äôd rather move toward development, deepening your Python, databases, and API building skills will help.\n\nBefore you leave your job, build a clear learning plan, pick projects to show off your skills, and maybe even contribute to open source to give you the momentum you‚Äôre looking for. That way, when the market improves, you‚Äôll be ready to land the kind of structured dev team role you‚Äôre aiming for.

Squarespace definitely has a pretty chill wlb and has a good engineering culture + you should have a very supportive engineering manager. There were regular company-wide panel meetings for engineers to showcase their recent work and share interesting news and upcoming tech. However, from my own experience, the product management and roadmaps can be a little shaky and if you are the type of dev that prefers autonomy and moving at your own pace, you might feel bogged down by all of the meetings and politics between different teams & departments.\n\nAs the other commenter said, options are definitely a crapshoot and thats part of the reason I left for a startup where my options would have a little more upside + I could have more eng & product ownership. By the time I left I had a few years of stock refreshers that were worth about 75k a year in straight up equity which were then converted to plain cash payouts after SQSP went private. The change to options was def a downgrade for me given that any potential value hinged on growth in valuation and going public again or doing a stock buyback/other liquidity event. At the time that I left a lot of people viewed the valuation target from the company leadership as a bit aggressive but who's to say that they can't meet it with some aggressive catch-up against their main competitors (eg. shopify with a current valuation \\~25x that of Squarespace when it went private).\n\nI'd say to not make the jump just because of the potential value of the equity, but if you're looking for a good engineering culture and interesting product to continue your career growth I would definitely suggest considering Squarespace",

You might find backend, automation, or even systems programming a better fit. Python is especially powerful because it crosses into both software development and cybersecurity. For cybersecurity, it‚Äôs useful for scripting, automating scans, and working with security tools.\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in cybersecurity, focus on Python scripting for automation. Networking basics (which you‚Äôve started on). Linux security and command line skills. Certifications like CompTIA Security+ or CEH (these can help open doors). If you‚Äôre more interested in software development, building a few solid projects (maybe a command line tool, an automation script, or a backend system) will help you stand out.\n\nEU companies often look for flexible engineers who can do multiple things. Stick with Python as your main tool, add depth with either Java or C#, and build some focused projects.

Ask them if they can stretch for it (it's a VERY low risk of them taking the offer back, I have literally only seen it happen ONCE in my life)\n\n2. Accept whatever their offer is.\n\nHere's some insider info from someone who's been in the hiring side convos, starting someone at the top end of the pay range would be pretty difficult unless they're basically someone who's 100% getting a promotion by the end of their first year. \n\nThe pay range represents something called the **pay band** that the job role typically exists within to account for annual raises over time. When you hit the high end of the band that means the only way to get a raise would be to receive a promotion. Since you're a new grad it's HIGHLY unlikely that they'll start you off at the absolute END of the pay band since they'll want to account for your first year effectively being a learning year where they won't really be able to argue a promotion for you. \n\nAll of this is contextual to each company and some job listings actually come bundled with multiple pay bands put together (this is where you get those WILD pay ranges where it's like $90k-@225k) because they'll actually pick your level based on where you land in the interview. \n\nIf you have anymore questions (this isn't written very well and I'm sorry for any confusion) please feel free to ask.",

Whatever the excuse is - there's a lot on the net about how to handle that.\n\nAfter that, I think it's about framing. If you say \"$90k or I walk\"... you're probably going to walk. But if it's more like they come in at 65k and you say \"Hm, the range for this role is up to $95k, and I was hoping that given <my experience in X relevant tech from internship Y> that we could start in the top half of the band. Would there be any room to move there?\" \n\nAnd, I mean, they might say no. But you're a) not being demanding and b) providing justifications. I wouldn't push it too hard, but most of the time asking politely will at least not tank the deal once you're at the negotiating stage.",

Just because you're applicant #531 doesn't mean you'll be the 531st person they consider.\n\nInterviewing tends to happen in batches. They may look at the first batch of 100, narrow it down to 5 people they want to talk to, and then go through the process with those 5 people. This can take several weeks. If at the end of that, none of those 5 people work out, they don't just go grab Person #6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in queue order out of that initial batch. They'll go look at the *next* batch of 100, applicants 101 through 200, and pick another 5 out of that batch. So applicant #101 might be the very next resume they look at when they're ready.\n\nSame idea applies to the age of the posting. Companies aren't interviewing hundreds of candidates concurrently. Interviewing takes time. Weeks. Sometimes months. And things rarely work out in the first batch, or the second batch, or even the third batch, so they may be actively looking for months.\n\nI've gotten offers out of postings that had hundreds of applicants, and that were over a month old.\n\nAt the end of the day, never disqualify yourself. If you're qualified for a posting, apply. Don't do mental gymnastics to talk yourself out of an opportunity.",
