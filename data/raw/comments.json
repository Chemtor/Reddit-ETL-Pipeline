It actually works really well and one of the few services where you can drill down and request a specific city and OS. Like, if I want to test a regional routing setting on my site I can request a crawl from a Android 13 phone in Baytown Texas and in seconds I get a result back and I can even see it on my end to verify. \n\nThe scary thing about this service is that I can request a crawl and if it is something illegal, that phone is on the hook until they can claim that they were not the ones that requested the site.",

He was an MBA who got dumped on the data team because he was the CFO's buddy who had fucked up one too many times on the finance team.\n\nThings he did while managing the small data team:\n\n1. Set up the initial infrastructure as a single prod database that read directly in from sources. No stage, no transformation layer, just source straight into prod. No backups either, and he thought backups were an extra expense we didn't need.\n2. Stored patient phone numbers and zip codes as numbers, dropping all leading zeroes for about four months' data until he put that into a reporting table and freaked out about why so many rows were wrong.\n3. After fixing the phone number issue, he decided to use phone numbers as a patient table's primary key, \n4. This is my all-time favorite: he put unhashed SSNs in a table that was fed into Tableau, so that all of our practice administrators could see the SSNs of all the patients across all of our practices. *Huge* security issue.\n5. Lied about a dozen times on a questionnaire about security practices for a data sharing deal the company wanted to do with BCBS. We were incredibly lucky that our privacy officer caught that on the way out and corrected things, although she ended up being the one who took the heat when BCBS said \"Oh *hell* no\" to the deal after seeing how sketchy things were.",

The second is about making more complex projects without losing quality of the solution.\n\nIf you can do both, it doesn't matter if you use LLMs or not.

On the one hand, if you actually manage to create some kind of long-shot digital transformation and data driven success story, that'd be pretty strong for you... OTOH yeah I think the odds of that succeeding are 0.01% given the factors you describe + your own lack of commitment to actually turning things around (you make it sound hopeless, which makes me think you yourself lack the grit to make a successful pivot happen).\n\nIf you want to stick around and try, you'll probably need to suck it up and pay out of pocket for some cloud subscriptions, buy your own Mac laptop, etc. The silver lining thing about a company with bad IT practices is -- you have the freedom to just go rogue, and \"probably\" no one will stop you if you intentionally build out your own shadow IT environment. Go sign up for a free Snowflake account ($400 in free credits), go hook it up with your own GitHub, and load up data from SharePoint by just downloading CSV files to your laptop... Yeah that would be all terrible and not best practices, but in this situation, it gives you autonomy and frees you from being blocked by IT. Then, with your rogue shadow IT environment, go BUILD something useful and amazing and revolutionary... You're trying to foment a rebellion here, but for your vision to win, you have to actually demonstrate something meaningfully different and revolutionary that COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED in their legacy stack -- if all you do is say, \"look guys I put our code into git, see this is better now\", then no one will give a shit because that by itself doesn't matter, doesn't change the business. \n\nBut I don't think you are going to be able to pull it off. So jumping ship seems like it would be better for you, but to be totally honest and blunt, your post gives me a weird vibe of someone trying to \"shortcut\" the career ladder by looking to be opportunistic about what's-best-for-your-brand, instead of someone who's actually sincere about putting in the work, engaging with stakeholders, learning how to dig out of a hole, etc. If you really want to be a director, you're supposed to learn how to overcome adversity, and not just look for the smoothest easiest path to inflate your title as high as you can with as little work or struggle as you can.",

Quantify impact and tie to dollars when possible. Prioritize use cases by impact and complexity.

Get business leadership onboard and have them instruct IT to give you the access and tools you need. This is the way.

Moose as an \"ORM\" is one approach (I know of at least one smallish company using it, they seem happy)\n\nWe've done something \"similar\" at Tinybird (similar in the sense that it's a CH abstraction designed to make it easier to integrate into the application), but our approach is more API-centric. Basically make it dead simple to turn a SQL query into an API, and then integration really becomes a question of how you handle your API routes in your backend code and doesn't really require you to \"think\" about the database.\n\nI'm genuinely curious to know how people would compare Moose vs. Tinybird - do people like the ORM approach? I'd imagine most people in this sub probably just love the raw ClickHouse/database interface anyway, but anyways... curious what people think",

They also have a philosophy of making dsta tooling as simple to use as possible.\n\nIf I was looking for a platform for complicated data transformations and many file formats, then I'd choose Databricks.

Otherwise, as you said, it will be a mess.\n\nHOWEVER, Why would you put yourself in that position?\n\nI understand you are a Data Analyst, not a manager or someone specifically tasked to improve the overall architecture.\n\nI've been there twice. Just as you seem to be, I am a proactive person who likes to improve stuff. Managed to convince the right people for a POC, made the POC with business money under a lot of pressure from them. Everything went well. I got more consideration/prestige, a small raise and lots of responsibility and work.  \nI almost enjoyed it.  \nNevertheless, I can assure you, If I were in your shoes, I would just automate stuff for myself (and here there is a lot of room) without improving too much of the official workflow \"for free\" (I understand it can give gains in the future).  \nThat is because the return you get from all that mess is usually very small compared to what you can do with more free time. Most of the time is the above: maybe a little more money, consideration from the management (which could open to promotions later on) and LOTS of work and responsibilities. And at the end of the day your did not really get the real hard skills that make you marketable elsewhere, nor you did learn about the proper practices. Maybe you did a little, but it is not enough.  \nAlternatively, you could free a lot of your time, upskill, bond with the right people at work and get invited to the right tables, work on yourself in general, work a side gig etc..\n\nI understand you already took initiative openly from the beginning, and you may disagree with what I said (I used to look in horror when hearing such things) but the truth is that no good deed goes unpunished. The company gives you the least possible in return for the most it can get from its employees. It is true that people inside the company could help give you back more, but the overall system is designed to exploit people that take on stuff \"for free\".  \nAny initiative I take, I make sure it provides something I could bring back with me when leaving the company.",

That gets messy if you're trying to hit a 15-min SLA with high reliability and source API quirks.\n\nHave you considered using a streaming CDC layer like Debezium or a change-data tool in front of the warehouse, and doing light pre-processing (like hashing) inline before landing to Snowflake? Or using something like Estuary, which can do incremental syncs, apply hashing inline before data hits the destination, and supports low-latency replication with built-in schema drift handling. Bonus is no maintaining connectors or DAGs.\n\nQuick q's: How often do schemas actually change in Salesforce for you? And are the PII fields always in fixed locations or could they appear in custom fields too?\n\nI work at Estuary, so naturally I'm biased, but it's built exactly for this kind of setup where off-the-shelf tools either fall short on compliance or require too much engineering lift.

Much cheaper than the more expensive tool you mentioned (about 1-2% cost, idk about the other tool)\n\n1. you can [pseudonymise](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/customising-pipelines/pseudonymizing_columns) before loading. you can even load to a local duckdb and then [sync](https://dlthub.com/blog/datasets2) to your final destination after transforming if you prefer to hash in sql.\n2. Here is [SCD2](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/merge-loading#scd2-strategy)\n3. dlt is self maintaining with [schema evolution](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/schema-evolution#alert-schema-changes-to-curate-new-data) and offers you hubspot and salesforce [sources](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/) too.

I don't think it is as easy to maintain as compared to Fivetran, but then Fivetran probably costs more.\n\nRe: API rate limits (for SFDC): we have never had an issue with this.  However, our account is allocated a very large quota for this.\n\nYou can setup a new Fivetran replication to Snowflake in 15min as long as you have setup the requisite security in SFDC and in Snowflake.\n\nin terms of SLA.  Fivetran offers various plans. We use the 'standard' plan and it provides for a 15min sync time.  Any lower than that you you need the 'enterprise' plan (I think).\n\nFivetran will not directly help with building SCD Type 2.  However, you can do a couple things here:  1) you can have it run in history mode, in which case it will not update in place rows that have changed. It will create new versioned rows as needed.  2) you can let Fivetran update rows in place but then use Snowflake STREAMS to detect the changes and then use that to drive any sort of SCD Type 2 dimensional needs (with whatever etl tool you have).\n\nFivetran also supports Schema Drift (for SFDC and other connectors).  You can control it so that FT will add new columns but not new tables (unless you want that).  It also handles cases where column datatypes change (although that can still break downstream etl).\n\n  \nFivetran or Airbyte the best pick for this? \n\n\\>>> I see no reason why Fivetran would not work for your needs but you need the budget.  For SFDC replication, budget for $800 USD per month (depending on what objects you need). Hubspot maybe less per month.\n\n* Have you dealt with PII masking before landing data in a warehouse? How did you handle it?  Fivetran handles this OOTB.\n* Any experience building or managing SCD Type 2? Not really a function of Fivetran or Airbyte \n* If you have pulled data from Salesforce or HubSpot, were there any surprises around rate limits or schema changes?

New queries that work well are given a thumbs up on the UI and get marked for review before adding to the FAQ. It‚Äôs not generating reports on top of the SQL, but it‚Äôs giving some basic analysis to get the user started. Automated report building probably comes next.

This works good enough when users understand that they can ask only things that are relevant to the concrete dataset. Some users trying to ask questions that only, maybe, deus ex machina can answer ever. In general, this function is good for non-experienced users and helps them to build their first reports. For advanced report options it seems a classic UI (report builder) is still more useful and less painful that typing prompts.\n\n- Report-specific prompts: when prompt's context is a report data itself (tabular data) and users can ask their own questions to this concrete report. Typical prompts like \"discover insights\" or \"find anomalies\" are available via menu items so this is just a one click and doesn't require any efforts from end users. These predefined prompts may be specific to the concrete dataset or usage of concrete dimensions/measures - for instance, when report uses \"Sales\" values and \"Year\" dimension, admin-configured prompt may compare values according to company's specific analysis. This function helps users with interpreting reports, especially if they are large tables.",

That at least stops mass exfil, but people could still potentially copy+paste whatever tabular data or log data they can pull up. That ability is pretty small though -- on the order of the information you could exfil by just *reading it and writing it down*.\n\nAnd that's the ultimate problem, if people have access to the data *at all* then they can potentially read something they shouldn't or do something with it they shouldn't. You should take reasonable steps to prevent oopsies and make it a hassle to do anything people shouldn't, but handicapping your worker's capabilities in a vain attempt to prevent the unpreventable isn't worth it. It massively increases labour costs, significantly reduces worker satisfaction, and doesn't really achieve anything.",

It's constant learning, even as an experienced engineer, whenever I switched to a new stack, I needed between one and two years to be proficient at the local stack and the local software. Good engineering managers know that and will mostly expect you to demonstrate that you are proactively learning by asking questions and reaching out to seniors to get help.\n\nIf you're good at SQL and have some experience with proper software engineering (git), dbt should be easy for you to pick up in a couple of weeks. Just follow their guides and best practices to make sure you use it correctly and in a way that is easy to follow by another dbt user.  \nSnowflake is probably the best hands-off OLAP distributed database, if you're good at SQL, there should be no difficulty. As with any data processing tool, the key is to focus on their documentation about optimizing query performance (partitioning, clustering...).\n\nSo, the learning is not going to be a problem, I think the hardest is going to be passing the selection in the current market.",

We all learn at different speeds and excel at different things.  People who make great analysts could be awful engineers.\n\nAlso depends on the expectation of your company.\n\n>For context I'm kind of in an odd spot where I've joined a new company working as an 'automation engineer' where the company is quite tech immature and old fashioned and has kinda placed me in a new role to help automate a lot of processes with an understanding that this could take a while to allow for discovery, building POCs, getting approval for things etc.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a great start for a flexible career.  Most companies need automation more than the latest tech and tools.\n\n>Has anyone gone through something similar?\n\nSelf taught across 6-8 months, so a lot less experienced than yourself, and went straight into a DE role.  Learning on the job was very fair in my first role because I filled a gap they needed - automation and modernisation.  In an ironic way, I know I just say companies need automation more than the latest tools, however, this role was fun because my job was to learn the latest tools and see how they could be offered to clients internally and externally.\n\nAfter 18 months, I got my second job.  Learning became a lot easier because I had already seen most things before.  The same patterns crop up and it was a lot more battling very poor design decisions made by members of the team as well as external contractors although still doing the same thing.",

Problem (problem for OpenMetadata ingestion) is that Cosmos will parse dbt project, and for each model creates separate task, which helps a lot of granularity, parallelism, and easier to maintain, and its simply how it should be done on Airflow. But it also generates 'run\\_results.json' for each of the models separately in temporary directory. Now we can always use callback to move it to any place we would like, but then we have run\\_results.json for each of the models.\n\n  \nDo i simply have one last step to merge all of the run\\_results.json files or there is an alternative strategy?",

Notice I didn't mention the LLM yet, we'll circle back to it later.\n\nOk, so you have a few chunks from man pages and pointers to various tools.

That's a middle term between option A and B.\n\nNow going back to the LLM call in step one. Why do you need that? You need it to generate good questions, not good answers. The vector store will bring you the answers, but if you only send the last line the user types, it can be something like \"What flags can I use to format the output?\" It's lacking content. The LLM is there to read this, along with all the conversation, and turn it into something like, \"What tool do I use to run health checks, and what flags can I use to format its output?\" That has a much higher chance to bring the chunks you need. It doesn't need to know your tools, only how to formulate a good question to surface those chunks from the vector DB.",

What DB are you on and how fresh do these ids need to be?\n\nIf you‚Äôd rather skip the replica vs primary headache, CDC into a cache or straight into your pipeline is usually cleaner.",

A sloppy WHERE date > last_refresh_date on a huge table can be a full scan, lock things up, and suddenly, the app is crawling. You do that once.

Usually you know what you are trying to achieve with a policy, so you can just go through the docs and find the right arguments. \n\n* Do you typically modify existing templates that your company has already created?\n\nSometimes. Sometimes it's from scratch-ish if I'm setting up something that doesn't already exist. \n\n* Or is this task often handled by a dedicated DevOps, Cloud, or Security team, especially in larger companies?\n\nI don't know about larger companies, and even then I expect it would depend on the company. In the companies I've worked at (startups / medium) the data team had their own AWS sub-account where we could implement whatever tools/policies we wanted - the official devops folks were focused on production architecture. We definitely worked with them and did some security reviews tho. \n\n\\> Should I dive deep into the IAM JSON policy syntax, or is it more important to have a strong conceptual understanding of what permissions are needed for a pipeline, and then learn to adapt existing policies?\n\nDon't bother learning the syntax unless that's going to be 90% of your workload. Copy paste is going to be your friend, and then you can adapt as needed. Keep in mind the principle of least privilege and you'll be fine - you always start from zero and only add access to what you need. But what you need is gonna depend on what you're trying to do (read? write? etc.) Architecture is much harder than the syntax piece.",

Sometimes you can think of it this way. If the business fires your whole team would there be a way they could continue to survive without you be it outsourcing, praying, etc. that question may cause more questions because certain sales guys could be fired in that context.

You‚Äôre absolutely right that the real picture is far more nuanced, and many essential teams are cost centres- accounts, IT, facilities, and usually. the executives themselves.

But the business will generally look to keep costs low.to use your example, the IT department is like rent- it‚Äôs an unavoidable necessity. \n\nThe trick as a cost center is to make sure your work gets properly credited to you, often through internal billing, sometimes via other KPIs and metrics.

In fact, many do.\n\nProfit centers are used to categorize the products or services that a company sells. By using profit centers, when examining a business you could say one division is more profitable than another division, etc.\n\nYou might try to say oh well Jeff is responsible for increasing profit through his role, but that‚Äôs an indirect thing. Jeff has to be paid a salary and the accounting line for that gets assigned to a cost center. Jeff probably isn‚Äôt a product, though I guess you can stretch this to say it‚Äôs possible when talking about a person who is a model, or stripper, or something like that haha. Then they are what‚Äôs being sold. But so long as Jeff is something like a sales manager a logistics director, he‚Äôs not the product. It‚Äôs not that he doesn‚Äôt matter, but on the books, he doesn‚Äôt get to directly be tagged like a product. Now, his work is more directly involved in transactions that do get tagged with profit centers, though, than someone who is, say, in human resources. \n\nTransactions for inventory changes of physical consumer goods often end up getting tagged to both a profit center and a cost center. The profit center is just related to what the good is. But the cost center is usually location based. Factory A and Factory B are different cost centers. This becomes important because other costs are posted to each factory and can differ, like labor costs and electricity and rent. So when doing financial analysis we can say that one product, while worth the same end sale price, might cost differently when produced in different factories.",

Just look at the contrib chart: [https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors)  \n  \nPinot not so much: [https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors)  \n  \nIf your main concern is maintenance and operational overhead, to me this is the most important thing. I think the ClickHouse community takes the cake.\n\nPersonally I also think that CH is just easier to reason about. The SQL is mostly standard with some CH-specific stuff, but if you know SQL you can be productive quickly. For logs specifically, it handles high-volume ingestion really well and the compression is excellent.\n\nI don't have as much hands-on experience with Pinot, but from what I understand it can be more complex operationally - more moving pieces to manage. The trade-off is that it's designed more specifically for certain real-time analytics workloads.\n\nSince you mentioned you're starting with logs and might move to business metrics later, CH might be the safer bet. It's proven at massive scale (we have customers running trillions of rows) and the operational complexity is manageable. Plus if you're planning to eventually query business metrics alongside logs, having everything in one system can simplify things.\n\nWhat kind of log volumes are you looking at?

I personally reviewed a few Synapse specific PRs this week, actually :D. \nAnd it's still Generally Available with no deprecation date set. \n\nAnd I wholeheartedly would agree new development should go to Fabric instead.\n\nI also think most customers of Synapse would benefit from migrating to Fabric when they feel ready to do so; it has many major improvements, both to performance and to the architecture. One of the big ones is that Fabric Warehouse uses Parquet as it's on disk format accessible in OneLake - no more \"best performance or least duplication\" tradeoff.\n\nWhy wouldn't I blame Fabric for Synapse not seeing much feature development?\n\nWell, designs of Synapse Dedicated and Synapse Serverless respectively had limitations that weren't practical to address without a major rearchitecting under the hood. \n\nSynapse Dedicated, for example, is the result of over a decade of incremental improvements that did not change its fundamental architecture (APS/PDW was released in 2012); we basically took it as far as it could go. \n\nSo we had to do some fairly major rearchitecting to make something fundamentally better than that; the result is Fabric. \nCould we have called it Synapse v2 or something? Maybe. But it still would have been a migration to move to it, so I'm not sure that would have been any better. And marketing isn't my area :D. \n\nIf you have questions on migrating to Fabric, or on Synapse, you can find me and many other folks who work on both Fabric and Synapse in r/MicrosoftFabric or lurking here.\nOr just tag me or message me, though there's no Service Level Agreement for my response times on Reddit :P",

LLMs need way more context than just schema info.\n\nFew things that have worked for me: semantic layers like dbt definitely help but you still need tons of example queries paired with business questions. Vanna AI approach is solid for this. Also worth checking out tools like Waii or Text2SQL.ai that specialize in this problem.\n\nThe real issue is that business users describe things completely differently than how the data is actually structured. Like they'll ask for \"revenue\" but your table has \"net_sales_amount\" or whatever. You almost need a translation layer between business language and actual schema.\n\nHave you tried fine tuning a model on your specific schema with lots of query examples? That seems to work better than just throwing documentation at it.",

Humans actually have judgment, they can be put in charge of things and knowingly take calculated risks, I don't believe LLMs have any real concept of this, when you ask them questions regarding more soft skill type stuff instead of strictly technical, they just BS you and basically answer the question however they think you wanted them to answer it, or they give a non-commital answer, etc. They can't really be trusted for anything serious and I think that will remain a huge gap for decades at least.",

I agree that a senior dev can do things AI can‚Äôt, but how is one supposed to become a senior dev when the junior dev position no longer exists? \n\nSure, some people are uniquely talented enough to jump straight into a senior management position. But for most people, you need to cut your teeth at a junior level for a few years and work your way up. With those lower level positions rapidly disappearing, EVERY job listing is starting to look like ‚Äú5-12 years of professional experience required‚Äù.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs assuming you have a CS degree. People like me (non-CS degree, self-taught programming for years, recently completing a year-long full stack boot camp) have zero chance right now. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm a better critical thinker, better at problem solving, have a deeper understanding of the programmer mindset, have better social skills, or have higher potential. It‚Äôs unlikely, verging on impossible, that I‚Äôll ever even make it past the automatic filters. None of that fluffy stuff like being ‚Äòpassionate, hardworking, and always eager to learn‚Äô, matters a bit until you actually land a job.\n\nThat‚Äôs what‚Äôs so disheartening and frustrating. I‚Äôm not out here looking for a free ride. But it‚Äôs hard to ignore that my odds of breaking into this field, regardless of my capabilities, are effectively zero and falling.",

It's pointless \"distinction without difference\" bullshit, frankly. It's misinformation at best. There's no universal list of knowledge/skill/activity per label (\"programmer\", \"coder\", \"developer\") just like there's no universal list of responsibilities per job title (\"software engineer\", \"programmer\", \"developer\"). Those of us who've been around a while have likely seen and held all of those titles and done the same, and differing, day to day work. Different orgs refer to people and roles slightly differently, absent protections for certain professional titles (e.g. Engineer).\n\nIf you want to say that it takes a programmer (or coder, or software engineer, or developer...) to be able to evaluate the output of LLMs in a particular context in order for LLMs to be useful for building complex software, just say that. There's no need to start splitting hairs over terminology. It just leads to wider confusion, and questions like \"what's the difference between X and Y\" where there is no meaningful difference, or the difference depends on the specific org etc. It also waters down your argument with doublespeak.\n\nThere is no difference between coding and programming.

Not only that but as of now AI doesn't even come close to a proficient programmer at any meaningful task as the AI generated code that I've read so far suffered from being extremely verbose, lacking proper structure, and containing lots of useless comments, which considering that we have already been suffering from a huge code quality problem due to businesses making it normal to focus on developer experience instead of user experience for decades, means nothing good for this industry.\n\nPeople using AI to take on tasks that they are not versed in are also hurting themselves, not only by letting it produce potentially crap code whose correctness they can't really verify, but because by letting the AI do it, they are also missing out on potentially insightful learning opportunities. AI might be able to generate lots of code very fast, giving people the impression that they are actually saving time, while in reality the brittle nature of that code couple with nobody really having a deep understanding of the train of thought behind it means that technical debt is accumulating very quickly, leading to whole projects having to be scrapped and rewritten from scratch once the codebase becomes unmanageable.\n\nWe might also already be witnessing the dawn of a new job title that I would call AI janitor, where some companies vibe code their way to success, the resulting mess becomes totally unmanageable, and they end up having to hire humans to rewrite everything from scratch. I am actually positioning myself to take on this role at some point in the future, by continuing to learn, keeping my brain sharp, and also taking advantage of AI to learn about AI itself and the use cases where it has already largely surpassed human intelligence and can actually be helpful, because honestly when it comes to this technology, I don't think this is the time to relegate myself to the passenger's seat when I can instead take it up to the next level by becoming a pilot.\n\nAt present, companies are collectively spending 10 times more on AI than they're making back, and that's not to mention our consumption of natural resources, so while it's generating revenue, it requires an insane and totally unsustainable amount of investment to do it. The hope is to eventually come up with a way to build an AGI, but since nobody can really predict the consequences of that, I don't think it's realistic to plan with that scenario in mind, especially when other scenarios like model collapse due to the phenomenon where AI slop in training data makes models significantly more likely to hallucinate are a lot more realistic, so I think it's safe to say that we're collecting betting our future on finding a pegasus unicorn.\n\nLastly, there's also the fact that, at present, AI still lacks human curiosity and drive to try new things, so if most people decide to rely on it, once the investment tap is shut, no new innovation will actually be achieved, including on AI itself, since no new problem-solving paradigms will be attempted as AI is only really able to shuffle combinations of the same old strategies. Therefore in the end AI might replace many jobs in this industry not because it became smarter than us but because we collectively decided to get dumber, and while I don't personally mind this scenario from an economical perspective, because I am positioning myself to not only survive the devastation resulting from the explosion of this hype bubble completely unscathed, but to also thrive by providing a helping hand in the aftermath, I am still concerned about the permanent damage we're doing to the natural resources on our planet which we're still totally dependent on for survival.",

There's still room for mathematicians, writers, researchers, mechanics and map creators, and of course software engineers.\n\nFor people who want to create software, either for money or passion, of course they should learn in-depth knowledge about how software works. But I think it is important for people to realize that the landscape of software development is just as large as any of the other fields I mentioned. Merely understanding code compares to software development as changing a tire compares to being a mechanic, or how being able to calculate compares to being a mathematician. Or even between being able to read (and post on reddit) versus writing a series of fiction books. Creating a fictional world requires a huge amount of skill beyond knowing what the words mean.\n\nFor the last couple of years before AI, there was such a huge demand for software developers that job positions were constantly filled with people who had basically just learned how to read code (and write a simple program at best). Which happened because digital literacy is so low and the demand for programmers was so high. That's good for those people, but I don't think it could have been a stable dynamic into the future.  \nNow that decent coding AIs are available, people simply don't know what the future will look like. The AI doesn't neatly fit in the corporate structures that have been built about working with a massive number of junior developers, so the industry will change. It is hard to know what skills will be desired for software development 5 years from now, so my suggestion is to maybe not chase the money right now, but definitely chase the passion.\n\nBut again, \"learning to code\" itself, I would say that everyone should do that, just to understand the very basics of the dozens of computer chips around you every day. (Even the notion that a person today interacts with up to a 100 different programmable computer chips every day is probably weird to many people. If you include internet servers in the mix, the number shoots up to thousands.) The world is still getting more automated every day, and digital illiteracy will eventually became as limiting as normal illiteracy is today.",

I routinely get a laugh out of the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm `round(random.normalvariate(27, 2))` years old. Is that too old to learn Python?‚Äù questions. Just go for it!\n\nOn AI, I‚Äôve seen a lot of tech hype over the years, but it seems like the right answer is to try what‚Äôs new. LLMs are interesting. Writing serious prose, I dislike pretty much everything I get out of them. But, by having something to react to, I more quickly clarify my own logic and get more done. Code completions are often not great when changing tasks, but they‚Äôre often good at making coordinating edits to match the one I just made. Generating longer code ranges from not all that useful (particularly specialized uses or where I have a clear idea of what I want) to massively productive (using a new to me package or things with a lot of boilerplate/structure like dashboards/web frameworks). It‚Äôs nuanced and not always predictable, so you experiment and build intuition. \n\nProgramming is great outside of work, too. I wrote a Python program to help us name our first child and made it (minimally) web-based to help us name our second. My five year old wanted to learn some Python (she saw it in VS Code while we were working on a short book we had an LLM write with her input), so I sat her in front of a terminal interpreter and had her type simple expressions like math and using string methods. The artwork on our walls is all on the same centerline, because I wrote a function to translate picture frame dimensions and the center of the stretched picture wire to a wall location for the hanging hook. I cant count the number of times I‚Äôve whipped up a personal project that analyzes some data or written some abomination of a regex that reformats something mangled into a structured form.\n\nOne of the amazing things about programming is that failure is frequent and relatively costless. Imagine if you messed up a cooking recipe and could simply edit and reprocess it with no ingredient loss and millisecond cooking time as many times as needed. That‚Äôs why diving in is the right approach. You‚Äôll answer your ‚Äúshould I‚Äù question quickly, and you may love it. The many small wins are really gratifying.",

I asked the receptionist nicely and she went and grabbed a spare for me. When I got back to the office, I got to hear the management telling my boss that the keys were numbered and it simply wasn't possible to give me a key.  As I triumphantly held up the key, my boss told them that their system had failed and hung up. The next week I baked a batch of cookies in the morning and dropped them off for the office next door. \n\nSoft skills makes things smoother. People look out for you and you can sometimes get a small job squeaked through even though everything is booked.\n\nBut you have to remember that everything goes both ways. You have to express your appreciation and bribery when people bend over backwards to help you out. Fresh bread, cookies, a box of live crickets delivered to the office, whatever will spark joy in the person who helped you. Hell, mail them a physical card saying thank you.",

Back when we were starting, you could just have the basic skills with almost no qualifications and stumble into a job. Also, startups aside, there used to be a lot more job security in general at the bigger corporations, but that doesn't seem to be the current climate.\n\nRegarding AI, I'm not saying it's gonna replace us all, but it's certainly causing a kind of mass hysteria/industry transformation/paradigm shift, and I don't know whether that will ultimately be for better or worse, I'm betting on worse. My personal thing is that I got into this career because I love to code and debug, but I never enjoyed all the other stuff, from design to meetings to bureaucracy to operations. Well with AI, the coding aspect is kind of ruined in my opinion, like being a good coder gives you very little edge, and on the job the coding will become more and more prompt engineering stuff which is just whatever, and the job will reduce down to just the other aspects.",

But once you actually get what problem SQL is trying to solve, how to databases generally work, and what are the general things you do with SQL like joins, aggregations, etc. then it becomes much more intuitive.\n\nI highly recommend looking at [https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2025/](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2025/) \\- it goes way more in depth than what any beginner needs but even if you do just the very first lecture and homework that already makes you more competent than most",

This is a 3-case lex, 3-function recursive descent parse, then single-function tree walk situation, if you want a proper solution. I'd expect the first solution to be some awkward/inflexible string splitting which broke the second the input changed slightly. If I had more than 30 mins I'd ask how it could be made more robust, at which point I'd expect a suggestion like mine above. I probably wouldn't make them code it up though. Just knowing tells me what I need to know about them for the purpose of the interview.  If I had to suggest the improvement, I might see if they could work with me to code it up by asking good questions etc, almost pair programming style.\n\nMy advice in these is always to use the interviewer as a resource as much as possible. Lots of people go very quiet and try to mentally brute force, then fail, when they could have asked for more help from me. I don't know what they need help with specifically without them asking. On the job, it's fine to ask colleagues things, so it's generally not frowned upon in interview either, as long as you're not asking for the full solution etc.\n\nEdit: code in thread below.",

It's only easy from the human perspective. It doesn't take you more than a minute to do that calculation, but you process the string in whatever order you want.

As you yourself said, it took half an hour even after you Googled for the C functions you needed.\n\nI suppose the tip is to know you C string functions. \n\nThere is a bunch of ways to solve it.

This applies to anything new. When I just started, I was terrible. I once \"randomized\" an array by generating random numbers and putting them in each slot, waiting longer and longer for the correct unused number as the array filled up. You need to push through this learning curve - there's no way around it. It took me about 6 years to become even moderately decent.\n3. You mentioned switching from one language to another. Here's the thing about programming: it's way more about understanding the concepts than memorizing the specific language syntax. If you understand how variables work, how if-else statements function, how loops operate, etc., you're already 80% of the way there with any language. The remaining 20% is just syntax differences you can easily look up when needed.",

But you'd need one stack for the file scanner objects (representing the system's view of the directories you had descended) and another for the data you were building for each directory... and you'd carefully inspect each file object, and push a new file scanner if it was a directory, and carefully handle your end-of-scan issues at each level, popping both stacks... it could get tricky.\n\nNow consider doing it with recursion.  You imagine the functional interface you want ‚Äì let's say, a File, and a DataSoFar.  Consider your base case ‚Äì is the File a simple file, not a directory?  Great, you're done.  Produce your output.  Otherwise you need to recurse ‚Äì okay, it's a directory: update DataSoFar, create a scanner from the File, loop through the scanner and call your function on each of the files.  Boom, done.  The book-keeping and boundary conditions are handled for you by the program stack, and you stick to familiar function calling and error-handling idioms.\n\nThe key leap for me is always that imaginative step: *what's the functional interface I wish I could use to solve one step of this problem?*  Recursion sometimes allows you to achieve that interface with minimal effort and great clarity.",

Each employee is only tasked with a small task, like finding a particular item or swapping two items based alphabetically based on their name. At the end, you'll have that one employee that found the item you were looking for or the warehouse will be sorted depending on what task you were trying to solve.\n\nThat's probably worse than any analogy a good article would provide.

Nobody working on the project would have any difficulty understanding what it did, even if they didn‚Äôt know precisely how it was doing it.

The next time you are building one of your own creations, you have some ideas of what pieces you have and how they could be used, so you disassemble some of your sets, and try to use the pieces in different ways in your own creation. Maybe it'll work, and you have to order more pieces like it - or it won't work and you have to imagine something else.\n\nWhen not building you are sorting your pieces, experimenting with connecting them in different ways, trying out small techniques outside of large projects, and you get ideas for how you also could use those pieces, maybe you even get an idea for a large project using the pieces that way!\n\nAlso, you follow builders on social media, and talk with other builders, asking for inspiration, looking inside their creations, and you are always learning!\n\nWhen you have an idea for something, but absolute no knowledge of how to build it, you try sketching it, experiment with the pieces you have, will this fit? No, well how about this? Maybe if I turn that one that way?\n\nYou won't always succeed, and some projects might be abandoned, but you are always learning!\n\n  \nDon't ever expect to \"see\" the magical piece that will solve your exact problem, if you have never worked on anything even remotely similar, or even seen pieces anywhere close to what you need!\n\nAnd don't think that you'll immediately get to know thousands of pieces and how they connect - sometimes you will have to make things \"the wrong way\", or simply \"fake\" them, make a function that pretends to do the work for you, until you learn the right way. Take a look at the LEGO creations by young kids, they almost never look exactly like they should, but they are an appromixation.\n\nSo, answer 1 is: always be learning, experiment with what you have, try to solve it close enough. And answer 2 is: Don't try to look for the perfect solution when you only know 1% of everything that is - look around you, and see if you can get just a little closer to your goal!

Without that, a five minute research search can end with me realizing it's 2 am and I've gotten nothing done. \n\nAs for the rest... it really is just experience, and not feeling bad about the fact that you still need to look stuff up X years in. For example, I've been using PHP for like 20 years and I still have to look up simple functions because I forget the syntax *all the time*. Who cares, though? I know what it does and how it works, not remembering what comes first in a substring isn't the end of the world.\n\nFor me, at least, becoming a better programmer is less about memorization or always knowing what the right \"piece\" is, and is more about a general understanding and \"feel\" for how things work. You might not know if a specific function exists to do what you want, and it sucks to spend the time working on something only to find out later it was as easy as using a function that already exists, but it's probably going to happen to you more than once - but now you know the function exists and you know how to work without it. Figuring out how to do something, even the most trivial \"I'll never need to do this again\" thing, is never a *bad* thing and will help you grow. Maybe later you'll be learning another language that's similar but it doesn't have an applicable function for what you were doing, and it's not a problem because you know how to do it by hand. This probably isn't the most realistic example, the point is that I try to never look at \"I just did more than I needed to\" as a negative as long as it's not causing you to miss deadlines (and as long as it's not happening constantly).\n\nI'm hesitant to push AI as it's really easy to become overly reliant on it, and you should never rely on code AI slings out without vetting it yourself, but if you treat it like a search engine it's certainly a lot easier to say \"I'm trying to do X with Y and am wondering what methods others currently use\" than to try and get the perfect Google search or scroll through docs.\n\nIt never hurts to join a coding community, either. I haven't done that since usenet but I'm sure there are discords or whatever out there.",

It took around 5 minutes to scan through and suggested a few dozen improvements. I looked at the git diff and approved or rejected each over 5-10 minutes, accepting ~90% of cases. In no circumstance would I have read through all my documentation to spot issues this way, because it would take at least a whole day.\n\nThen I asked it to improve test coverage, it ran the test coverage tools and unit tests, after about 10 minutes it had suggested another batch of changes that took me 5-10 minutes to review. I brought my test coverage up from 87 to 96%.\n\nI then asked it to check that terminology is consistent between my function documentation. Asked it to organise my unit tests into logically related blocks, asked it to write descriptions for unit tests into a particular way.¬†\n\nEssentially I have a lot of tasks that I would need to spend a few hours on, that AI can do for me in a few minutes, and I can check in 5-10 minutes. It‚Äôs greatly accelerating my work, eventually I‚Äôll run out of such tasks, but my codebase will be in a significantly better state by then.",

Naturally, you do need the experience to know what is insignificant and what shouldn't be left to AI. Quick little sanity checks (e.g. is this thread safe, link the docs, does this database driver support X, .etc) when you're tired are also nice.\n\nit is not a 10x increase unless you're a beginner who struggles with many concepts and having them written out for you saves you a lot of time.",

Create tight feedback loops. Run your code often.\n2. When experimenting or debugging, create hypothesis and then systematically test them\n3. Write more documentation, learn to tell the difference between good documentation and bad documentation.\n\nTo create tight feedback loops, you need to have a very short time between when you've written a bit of code, and find out if it's working or not. There are a lot of good strategies for this, and you can mix and match them according to your needs. A few I like are: Static types, tell you a lot of information about your program's correctness at compile time. REPL driven development, run snippets of code in a REPL to get immediate feedback on whether they're working as you're developing more complex systems. Good testing practices, writing tests as you work let you run the test suite as a very good way to get fast feedback on your code. When coding, I start to get nervous if I've gone more than a few minutes without running some of the code I'm writing.\n\nFor creating hypothesis, I see way too many new developers just randomly change things whenever they get stuck. If you can't clearly communicate why you think the change will fix a problem, or what the expected result of a change is, that's a sign you need to take a step back and do some thinking / learning. It takes discipline, but forming explicit hypotheses and then testing them drives you to actually understand the how and why of your code.\n\nWriting good documentation doesn't mean just adding comments to your code, but thinking about how other users of your functions / classes / projects will use them, and giving them all the necessary information to be successful. This means beginner guides, project overviews, as well as function / class level documentation. Writing good docs makes you really think about your API design and software usability on a new level.",

Not necessarily trivial - I've been programming for almost 4 decades, but I've never learned Rust for instance and if you told me I had to write something in Rust with a gun to my head I of course couldn't do it. But if I got hired for a job and was told \"Oh yeah we only work in Rust\" I'd just go \"Great, I'm excited to learn Rust!\" and not be too intimidated by it.\n\nOnce you've got a strong foundation, your choice of technology will just be driven by what you want to *do* next. You pick something you want to create (or get hired onto a job) and you learn what you need to know as you need to know it. If you're working on getting hired, you pick a project that overlaps strongly with the needs of your local job market, and you learn what you need to make yourself an attractive candidate.\n\nBut if you don't have fundamentals down, go back to working on that. Without tutorials, AI, or any of that junk. Take one of the many free university courses (university courses, even if they're free and not for credit, tend to be much more rigorous than much of the junk on youtube or whatever) and get your data structures and algorithms skills solid, etc.\n\nFirst step though is really assessing where you are right now.",

Knowing the concept is way more important than knowing only one implementation.\n\nWhen you move to a language you don‚Äôt know - say Rust - and you try and implement an endpoint as a Node Express style async function, you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time.

Next step is about actually saving that data.\n\nTo save data, you need a database and you'll need to talk to it through a Structured Query Language called SQL. You can learn SQL [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/), but then the database stuff gets a bit complicated. You can install MariaDB locally and learn on that, then in the future you'll want to learn about Docker Compose to avoid having to install the DB locally during development and you'll probably want to use PostgreSQL, but right now it doesn't matter. Just go with SQL/MariaDB and learn the concepts.\n\nOnce you've got a database, your Node.js app will need to somehow connect to the database you just installed. For MariaDB, there's a [package](https://mariadb.com/docs/connectors/mariadb-connector-nodejs/getting-started-with-the-node-js-connector) for that.\n\nBoom, back-end with API and data storage achieved, without tutorial, all by yourself. It's the same steps for any programming language.\n\nAdmittedly, that route is what a tutorial would give you, but anyway. Concepts are what's valuable at the moment. Or if you feel like you'd have more fun in Go than TypeScript, then just go for it, it'll be roughly the same thing.",

There is no tutorial, there is no shortcut.\n\nTutorials/courses can teach you the basic skills; they can lay the *foundation*. It is upon you to build the house brick by brick, floor by floor.\n\nYou start with small, simple games and work your way up.\n\nTake the game engine of your choice (I'd recommend Godot for starters) and build something simple, something like e.g. *Tic-Tac-Toe*. Then venture into more complex territory, e.g. something like *Battleships*. Then, move on to more complex tasks, e.g. *Sokoban (Box Pusher)* - these are all fairly simple to make games that will each teach you a lot. To get something more dynamic, the classic *Pong* or *Breakout (Arkanoid clone)* are good starts, but only after you have progressed enough. Make a *Pacman* clone. \n\nUsing old games has the advantage that the entire *game mechanics* are well known and well documented.\n\nWhen you gradually build up your skills you can always venture into larger, more complex games, make the switch from 2D to 2.5D (often also wrongly called Isometric) to 3D.\n\nWith each game you make you will improve your skills, *provided* that you don't just do tutorial after tutorial that creates the game *for* you. At utmost, use the tutorials as inspiration and try to make things on your own. Then, if you fail and can't find a solution, look at the tutorial to see how they did it. Don't just copy the tutorial. First, try on your own. Experimenting, trying, failing, fixing are all part of learning, copying is not learning.\n\nAlso, games are developed *incrementally*. They start with simple mechanics, e.g. how to interact with the player, how to set up the levels, etc. Then, they work with the collisions, and so on. Commonly, the *game art* is quite far towards the end of the development. Sure, you need to know roughly how big your game entities (players, enemies, background, etc.) will be but you don't need to have them fully developed at the start.\n\nGet things working first and then make them good and pretty.",

Most of them can do the task. It's just what you like.\n\nThink about C++ and Objective-C. Both were attempts to make C object-oriented. Did one stop when they heard about the other? Did C++ win because it was the best for the job? No, C++ won because it was part of AT&T which was a much bigger entity than the folks that developed Objective-C.\n\nIt's just like natural languages. Is English the best language? Some (who natively speak it) say yes, but it's only because they speak it. Others insist that their language is best. We could learn Esperanto which was a designed language where the ease of learning was a key objective. Yet, it's not popular because people love their own languages, and maybe ease of learning isn't that important. Some people love how complex their language is (or how many feature it has).\n\nTo get to your second question, there are languages that try to avoid using null, so they have to create Option types (that's one way to do it). This creates a level of mental overhead that those who have never used those types find unimportant, yet others, who think null pointer exceptions are evil and the cause of many errors feel it's justified.\n\nOr languages that want to be pure functional have problems with I/O, such as printing, and have to use complex math structures like monads, when everyone else feels printing is really easy, but it's counter to the functional philosophy.\n\nProlog was built to have a backtracking mechanism, and for most, it looks like nothing you'd expect and is hard to get your mind around, and because of that, hard to figure out. Erlang, which was inspired by Prolog, has a syntax that's hard for those used to C-style syntax (which is most popular languages) to understand, partly because it was designed before language designers decided languages should look like C.\n\nAnd was that because C was a great language? No, but it was hugely popular in industry, so to design languages that looked like C was considered beneficial because people were more likely to try out your language if they didn't have to struggle with the syntax as much.\n\nFunctional languages don't like having state, so they don't have plain old for-loops because the looping variables change values. So, they use functions like: fold, map, filter, zip, etc. to achieve looping capabilities without a looping variable. They also rely a lot on recursion.\n\nIt helps if you try these other languages like learning Prolog or Erlang or Haskell to see how different they are.",

Any Turing complete language, which is effectively all of them, can manipulate state, which is what programs do.  Any general purpose language, which is most of them, can do most tasks.\n\nHowever, where those languages can be used is a function of implementation.  OS broadly, web browser narrowly, your favorite game, maybe Lua.\n\n> Can you give me examples of where some feature is not implemented in a language because it would directly block another feature? \n\nHow about [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)?  How a language lets you define and handle types tends to be a defining feature.  It also will impact every aspect of how you develop a program in that language.  Choose one, block the other.  A strict type system catches errors at compile time, a loose one might only catch some errors at run time.  Write your tests accordingly.\n\nAlong the same lines, [mutablity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object).  This is the break point between imperative and declarative.  The level to which that can be dictated by the programmer also defines a language.\n\n[Function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) comes to mind.  It's extremely popular, lots of languages do it, and lots don't.  There are pros and cons in implementing such a feature.  There is implementation complexity but also programmer expectation.\n\nGarbage collection?  How resources are released is a big deal in all languages.  In some languages, all clean up is the responsibility of the programmer.  In others, the programmer barely has a say.\n\nVirtual machines?  Java and .NET, among others, run inside a sandbox.  This is good for portability and stability, buy denies access to the OS; you get what the sandbox gives you.\n\nLast, but not exhaustively, libraries.  The standard libraries available to a language might dictate its use.  If what you want to do only has a library in C, you're either porting it to your favorite language, creating an interop wrapper for it, or writing in C.",

Power point was never intended to be used as a programming language but you can use it to programm anything and thus it also wont ever recieve a lot of the common features so you would have to write them your self.\n\nA more relaistic example are garbage collections. Some languages have them others dont. And this is not a this language just hasnt gotten to the point of implementing them, its a deliberate decission to leave it to the programmer to do deal with it them self so they wont ever get that \"feature\". You can also argue that its a feature to not have a garbage collection.\n\nThis goes on with other things, like some languages are made in mind to be used with oop and thus have strong support for oop. Other are made in mind with procedual code. And the maintainers of a procedual language wont implement oop features. \n\nSo no its not about just speed.",

Then you will get to apply those basics to build something that _interests YOU_. Useful can also mean, that you are learning something. Maybe you are learning a new language, a new framework, a new library. That is useful as a preparation for other things to come.\n\nWork? Yes, yes ... That will be how you sustain yourself, but most likely, if you are a craftsman, or artist, work will be less interesting, than your own projects. As you progress in skill, your work will probably be simpler, more rote, than your own projects.\n\nAbout interviews: Don't forget, that interviews are a stress situation. Depending on the person, mostly what they test is stress resilience, not your computer programming skill. What you are describing about being given 2h and a bunch of files ... That might as well be badly designed code, that is a trap into bad design. In such a situation you might have to deal with the shit you are given as code, but keep an open mind to alternative solutions.\n\nI have been working for 7y mostly using Python and still I did no good in interviews with live coding. Sometimes it was the requirements, that were too narrow, them expecting one particular solution. Other times I was too nervous and simply couldn't think straight. In contrast to my work experience, in which I basically built a company from the ground up, at least on the technical side, and on my own designed and developed multiple still maintained services, that make the company their money.\nSo mostly my interviewing experience has been quite shit, and it can happen to everyone.

An instance of that class template\n\nBecause the syntax is different, you instantly know which you‚Äôre looking at.

Each of your 4 sections has a very different width, it just looks off-putting. Make some kind of a wrapper and make sure all sections fit and take up as much space in it. OR you could embrase the chaos and do something unique, but you wont be doing that with a typical SPA with 4 vertical sections, if you want to be unique, change up the layout entirely\n- I get the idea of having one section on a screen, but that doesnt really work well for bigger resolutions. Responsiveness doesnt just mean that nothing breaks and overflows, it needs to be proportional and usable on all devices\n- As cool as the nav is, it suffers from poor UX, because its highly unclear what it is, and once you click on it to figure out, at that point you dont even need it. One thing that came to my mind is putting it vertical on the left side for example. That way you can show the section names on hover, and keep your original design. \n- Same UX applies to your technologies. Always write in words what the technologies are. This helps searchability and makes it clear for people who do not know what a whale with boxes on it or an elephant mean.\n- 2/3 of your listed projets require login (or something adjacent), no one is gonna do it. Either make sure these projects have a landing page, preview, or anything else. Or make a showcase with pictures and videos in your portfolio \n- For some reason the whole website feels cheap, i cannot quite explain why objectively. I think its the look and the color scheme of the stars in the background. But could also be the overal color scheme and font\n- Last but not least, i would put maybe a little bit more information about yourself and in general, its kinda empty\n\n\nAnd one note, whatever the SEO situation is, you probably don't need seo at all for a personal portolio. No one who you didn't already send your portfolio website is gonna look you up on google and search for it.\n\nThis is all constructive criticism. Hope the post doesnt turn into a [deleted] and you actually make some improvements and update us. Good luck!",

Having to read through someone else‚Äôs code or even your own old code to try to piece it together is a pain, and adds unnecessary dev time. So in a professional setting you have to do what your purist dork coworkers want, but if you have the freedom to do so I vote pro comment.",

        "body": "Comments that explain are fine when you're learning. In fact they're probably a good idea!\n\nWhen you start to work with other people, the rule is \"Good code is self-documenting,\" meaning it should be obvious what the code does without needing explanatory comments.\n\nUse variable names, data structures and encapsulation to minimise the amount of thinking that a reader has to do. For example, I'd refactor your code to make `Card` a class:\n\n```\nclass Card:\n    def __init__(self, cardString):\n        self.name = self._getName(cardString[0])\n        self.value = self._getValue(cardString[0])\n        self.suit = self._getSuit(cardString[1])\n\n    def _getName(self, cardFirstCharacter):\n        if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards:\n            return v.faceCards[cardFirstCharacter]\n        elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A':\n            return 'Ace'\n        else:\n            return cardFirstCharacter\n\n    def _getValue(self, cardFirstCharacter):\n        if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards:\n            return 10\n        elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A':\n            return 11\n        else:\n            return int(cardFirstCharacter)\n\n    def _getSuit(self, cardSecondCharacter):\n        suits = [\"Hearts\", \"Diamonds\", \"Clubs\", \"Spades\"]\n        return next((suit for suit in suits if suit[0] == cardSecondCharacter), None)\n```\n\nThen `hit()` becomes easy:\n\n```\ndef hit():\n    drawnCard = drawCard()\n    v.cardIdens.append(drawnCard)\n    card = Card(drawnCard)\n    return card.name, card.value\n```\n\n**Variable names** - `drawnCard` and `cardString` are the exact same thing, given different names in different contexts. The `Card` class doesn't need to care that a `cardString` was just drawn from `drawCard()`. Similarly, `cardString[0]` might look a bit mad, but when we pass it to a method we rename it to `cardFirstCharacter` in the method, which clearly tells you what it is.\n\n**Data structures** - I'm really bad at this to be honest. I'm a JavaScript dev, and JavaScript only has arrays (lists) and objects (dicts), so I tend to think only in arrays and objects for any problem.\n\n**Encapsulation** - `hit()` doesn't need to know or care how a card's value is calculated, because that implementation is _encapsulated_ in the `Card` class. If `Card` is assumed to work fine (because we also wrote tests!) then a developer debugging `hit()` can ignore it. Similarly, `Card._getSuit` contains some _really_ funky code, it's borderline unreadable. But if we only care how a card gets its name and value, we don't have to read any of the funky code that gets the suit.",

A backend of some sort (usually some kind of API that serves JSON, but depending on your design it might also serve fully rendered HTML), a database that stores persistent data (user info, product info, user content, etc) that your backend interacts with, and a frontend that consists of HTML, JS, and CSS (this frontend may be served by the same backend discussed before or could be served by a different service.

Another might be that you have really specific performance requirements that demand a certain stack. \n\nFor you, the answer is \"whatever you want\". Really. I would look up some common stacks that maybe use languages you're already familiar with and then just pick one and go with a getting started guide. \n\nLike javascript a lot? Use MERN.

It doesn't have to be bound to a controller. It can be, but a DTO is just that: A data transfer object. It is a box of properties that simply moves data from A to B. It can be used to move data outside of the application, but it can also be used to simplify transferring data from one side of the codebase to the other.\n\nHowever, if we assume that a DTO in this case always correlates with some data being returned in a controller, then you'd most likely want to do the mapping in the controller. Being dogmatic about this can be a little difficult, as you'd quickly end up making DTO objects between the service and the controller layer for situations where you have to join together data from different sources (which can be fine as well).\n\nThe issue with having the service layer coupled with API DTOs is that other parts of the system might want to use your service without being coupled to the API (which you point out in your post), which can become a problem. However, if that doesn't happen, then there's no issue.\n\nMy point is that there's no single rule. It depends on the dependencies within the system, as well as how the system will develop over time. \n\nMy general advice here is to push everything outward from the core of your application until it starts to become annoying. When you've found the sweetspot, then keep it there until other things start making it annoying, then consider pushing it further out (or pull it inwards) depending on how it is annoying. Don't be set in stone; instead, be pragmatic and flexible.",

Without it, we have to do this mapping on our own.\n\nThen we can can make a simplified DAO service, which provide CRUD operations we can use in the controller (presentation layer). It's already possible to use the ORM operations directly in the controller, but I prefer a service class to make this cleaner.\n\nSomehow, we have to map from entityDTO to presentationDTO. The presentationDTO is used to return a response to the client. \n\nI read that this mapping is done in the service layer, the problem:\n\nIf we map the entityDTO in the service to the presentationDTO, the service will always return a presentationDTO that is expected to be used in a controller or view.   \n  \nFor example, in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) core, we do not want to return a response from the entityDTO directly, since they contain navigation properties. We want the JSON output to exclude the navigation props and instead translate type references to foreign key fields. That is why we map to a presentationDTO.\n\nBut sometimes we want to use service class in another service class and we do not want to already return a presentationDTO from the service. In this case, the service should return an entityDTO so we can use this data in the other services if necessary. Then if we want to map this entityDTO to a presentationDTO, it's best to do this in the controller.\n\nDo you know what I mean?",

You *can, it's possible,* in the same way anything you want to code is possible. The convention is to not return these in this form. They are mapped the moment they are retrieved from a database, so by definition they are returned from the Data Access Object (or DB layer) and this is unavoidable - so you always start by mapping the data from a persistence driver to a language class instance (or dictionary).\n\n  \nWhile controllers return a *response* that can easily just be whatever the service returns wrapped in whatever response your protocol expects. The response from a service is what is in question here.\n\nIn spring for example, you will commonly see in a service:\n\nexample() {  \nvar stuff = repo.getStuff();  \n...business logic...  \n\n\nreturn stuff.stream().map(StuffToDtoMapper::EntityToDTO}....;\n\n)\n\nThis is done in the service layer because the service doesn't want to return the entire entity model to the controller, assuming it's a service method that is called directly by a controller, often times, the service might not even be receiving the entity itself, but rather an intermittent object still on the database side (e.g. spring projections) which it would still want mapped to a presentation DTO, as you said.\n\nWhen you want to use the entire entity in a different service, which is completely normal, you define a separate method in your service (some even opt for different services, but that's overkill in my opinion) that returns the entity itself, indicating that it is used for inter-service communication and not to be routed back through a controller.\n\nAll these things are just conventions, you can technically do anything you want, but this communicates intent to other developers who are familiar with the convention.",

But practising is the best medicine imo. You seem like a smart individual but don't get yourself twisted over achieving stuff like becoming a 10x developer, I'm guessing a part of having that amount of skill is also part of just loving to code and doing it a lot (of course there are cases of people who just inhale knowledge and have such a robust logical mind that it comes easy to them but that is besides the point) and if you can think of the logic how to tackle problems during coding before even touching your keyboard then you're on the right track (not a must but is nice) coding is just logical thinking.

To clarify a bit, they're decent at writing a number of things, but I've also seen them do a number of dumb things that cost more time than they've saved.\n\nThe other rather significant problem is that while you can use them to build a number of things by piecing things together it starts to fail when you have to debug even relatively small programs. Even if you've all the features enabled to have it try to analyze, run, and test a program it will still often fail somewhere. Though it will completely confidently proclaim that what it wrote it works properly when it definitely doesn't. I've seen this just trying to get it write unit tests for things that are only mildly complicated. Other times the project is just too big to fit in the context window. A bit of an anecdote here, but I still find it humorous seeing certain models try to run code (not written using Python) in a Python interpreter even when you explicitly told it not to.\n\nI expect we'll see a shift from monolithic to more microservice based programs to help meet AI in the middle, but we're not there across the industry today.",

You may have taken courses in some domains to get a deeper understanding of the subjects, which can be helpful if you want to work in these domains.",

That thing could knock my eyeballs out. I wasn't using my brain for anything at the time, so I would get up in the middle of the night and spend a couple hours playing around with it. Eventually I started writing code in Amiga Basic. Then I realized that Basic sucked, and I bought an Amiga C compiler, and eventually a debugger. \n\nThen it occurred to me that with these newfound skills, I might be able to stop delivering furniture. Actually... I delivered some desks to a warehouse in Phoenix where they were working on the first really successful map program for PCs. Can't remember what it was called. I tried to make an appointment to deliver some more desks the next day, and one of the guys there said in sort of a lofty, sophisticated voice, \"I shouldn't be disturbed tomorrow, I'll be writing code.\" That was one of the coolest things I had ever heard.\n\nSo at that point I wanted to be a real programmer. I started applying for jobs. Nothing happened. Then I thought \"Maybe if I SEND these people my code...\" It was a stupid idea, but it got me a couple of interviews. I went to the first interview, but they were already mad at me because I hadn't put enough postage on my printout. The second time I sent code out I put plenty of postage on it, and they hired me for Customer Support because the code I sent was event-driven UI, and that's where they were going. No more moving furniture.\n\nSo after a week of doing Customer Support, I went and told the guy in charge of programming department, \"Hey, I found a bug in the code.\" And he literally said, \"Well, fix it.\" So I fixed it. And then I just jumped in the deep end. Eventually they put me in the programming dept, but didn't replace me in Customer Support. So I just kept doing both jobs. \n\nAfter a year or so, they hired somebody for Customer Support and started giving me raises. \n\nReally, that company was a terrific place to Be All You Could Be. I just wish I had realized that. Because after 10 years, I quit, looking for something better. I didn't realize that there were WAY worse places I could be. Had to learn the hard way.\n\nI doubt that this story can help you. Things are different now. Back then, there was a terrible shortage of programmers. Now it's a glut. Also, I could do wonders with copy of Petzold's Programming Windows, a DOS 4.0 manual, and some DB stuff. Now the list of things to learn is as long as both of your arms.\n\nI'd say, if that's what you want to do, don't let anything stop you, work or study 12 hours a day or more, WRITE CODE ALL THE TIME, be persistent and focused. Maybe that'll work eventually.",

Then expose the Pi server to the internet however, e.g. using Cloudflare.\n\nFor a more robust setup, I'd go with an ESP32 (capable of deep sleep when idle) to read the button, which sends a notification to a backend API server, which updates a separate static web server.

Yes, Dijkstra's algorithm is definitely widely used.\n\nIt's generally not meaningful to compare things like \"number of iterations\" or \"number of function calls\" between two different algorithms, or two different implementations of the same algorithm (unless they're very similar to each other).\n\nIf actual practical performance is what matters, then comparing the actual running time is what matters, so that you can fairly compare the effects of things like synchronization overhead.\n\nProbably, the most useful comparison would be to draw graphs of the *average* running time for graphs of different sizes, and also with different numbers of threads (or CPU core counts) so that you can see where the break-even point is, i.e. where the benefits of parallelism outweigh the extra overhead. Varying the sparsity of the graphs would also be interesting.\n\nIf you're interested in the theoretical big-O complexity, then numerical measurements don't really matter at all, and instead you'd need to formally analyze and rigorously prove some kind of upper-bound on the amount of work done by each thread. This is likely to be a lot more difficult than just taking measurements.\n\n----\n\nAn additional note: as you said, the basic form of Dijkstra's algorithm gives the \"single-source shortest paths\" from a source to *all* other nodes. But in practice, we are often only interested in the path from one source to one destination. A simple and obvious optimization is to just stop the algorithm as soon as the destination node is expanded (because at that point its path is guaranteed to be optimal). \n\nA less obvious optimization is to do a *bidirectional* search, which works both forwards from the source and backwards from the destination simultaneously, terminating when they meet. This often results in expanding dramatically fewer nodes. (If you imagine the \"frontier\" as being circular, then then two circles with radius d/2 have half the area compared to one circle with radius d.)\n\nYou might want to see if your parallel algorithm can be adapted to handle one or both of these optimizations. That'll make it more likely to be useful in practice.",

It's crazy how fast I can knock out features using that stack and AI.\n\nNow, some will say that AI-generated code can be buggy, and they are not wrong. I use a philosophy of delegation, not abdication. Any code that goes into my codebase is my responsibility, regardless of how it is generated. So, I read every line and use automated tests to ensure I'm not accidentally breaking anything while going fast. \n\nSo, are you doing anything wrong? Maybe. You definitely want to be comfortable coding because AI isn't always the best solution for a given problem. That said, once you are comfortable coding in your language and framework, pretending AI doesn't exist will slow you down. It's not going away; it's a powerful tool, and we should learn to use it. Even Senior Engineers can get a non-trivial productivity boost from AI.",

Arguments are input parameters that a function will accept.  \n\nSome functions take no argument. Some have required arguments, and some allow for optional arguments. \n\n When I create GetBirthday, I have to include what these argument parameters are going to be.\n\nfunction GetBirthday(person)\n\n\nThen when I want to use it, I call the function.\nlet bday = GetBirthday(john)\n\nSo what's important to understand is that a function is a named block of code. It accepts inputs, which we call arguments, and it returns outputs based on the input. It can have no input, required input, or optional input, depending on how the function is defined.\n\nIn most programming languages, we use the () to list the input arguments to our functions.",

In a basic sense functions take in data do something with it then return data back to whatever called it.\n\nit‚Äôs generally bad practice to have functions work on non local variables if you can avoid it because it makes the code less reusable and more prone to weird difficult to diagnose bugs because you have many functions work on the same data it becomes much harder to diagnose and fix undefined behavior.\n\nSimple pattern to start. If you need to mutate a variable, instead of the function mutating the variable directly, set the function to take an input, mutate that input and return the value you want to mutate. That way the function can do the same behavior, mutating the variable, but it can also save that variable to a new variable.\nHere‚Äôs a sample snippet of python code to explain what I mean.\nEdit: Reddit messing up formatting here.\n\ndef increment(x):\n        return x + 1\n\ncount = 0\n\ncount = increment(count)  # updates original\n\nnew_count = increment(count)  # keeps original\n\nCount starts at zero, the increment function increments it by one and then you save the incremented count to new_count. This structure is much clearer to people reading your code, the function can now be used for more than just mutating a single global variable and you are discouraged from creating single use functions.\n\nAs you get better at programming, free floating variables become much rarer. Most variables are used as temporary storage for working data, (and if we are really to get into the weeds they act as human readable abstractions that become pure memory operations at compile time) while all persistent data has a clear owner. This makes it much easier to reason about where data lives, who‚Äôs allowed to change it, and how long it will exist. If you are making simple python scripts right now it might seem tempting to do things quick and dirty, after all that is what python is good for, but developing good habits in the beginning pay dividends once you have to start working on more complex systems.",

Frontend devs wanting to go full stack. Most find it easier to stick with JavaScript ecosystem first (Node/Express) then maybe explore Java later if needed. But if your project specifically needs Spring Boot or you're targeting Java jobs, then go for it.\n\nEither way, the key is building that project while you learn. Don't just do tutorials tho.

Once you finish that, do it again. Then, try again the next day, and the next week.\n\nYou'll encounter different bugs each time, which will help you get a better overall understanding of the project.

        "body": "It's not clear, to me, what algorithm you are using. There's one (or more inefficiency) which is the malloc/free which is considered a bit slow. There's a question of what your objective is, that is, do you want to have an array of the factors as a result or just print it out. Printing it out would be much easier, but then it's hard to use the factors afterwards.\n\nBut the optimization is something rather simple and follows a trick that you use to determine if a number is prime.\n\nInstead of going from 1 to n, you go from 1 to ceil(sqrt(n)). Here's why you can stop at the square root of n. \n\nSuppose you find a factor that's smaller than the square root of n. Let's call it x. Because it's a factor, there's also another factor y such that `x * y = n`.\n\nNow `y` has to be bigger than (or equal to) the square root of n. If it weren't, then you have two numbers smaller than the square root of n which, when multiplied, will be smaller than n.\n\nYou might wonder, could we miss some factors greater than the square root of n by stopping so soon? The answer is no. Why? For a similar reason. Suppose there is a factor, `y` that's bigger than the square root of n. Then, it must have a corresponding factor, `x`, which is less than the square root. If it didn't, then both `x` and `y` would both be greater than the square root of n, and their product would be greater than n (which would mean they aren't factors).\n\nSo, you could modify it something like\n\n      float root= sqrt((float) n); // or however you get the square root\n      // Crude way to get the ceiling of the root\n      int limit = (int) (root + 1);\n      for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i++) {\n         if (n % i == 0) { // Check if it's a factor\n            // It is\n            printf(\"%d is a factor\\n\", i);\n            int other = n / i; // Get other factor\n            if (other != i) {\n                 // Don't double print if we hit the square root\n                printf(\"%d is a also a factor\\n\", i);\n            }\n       }\n\nIf you wanted to save the array allocation cost and do it once, you could run this loop twice. The first time, you'd check for how many factors there were (create a counter before the loop and increment each time you print). Then, you'd malloc the array, then fill in the array again.\n\nHard to say which is more efficient, but the square root trick is pretty useful because square root of n is MUCH smaller than n, so that's the number 1 idea you can use.",

        "body": "Squeezing this kind of optimization (to me) seems silly. You're calling the square root function *once*. On the other hand, you're computing `i * i` each time through the loop. When both are good enough (C programmers from the 1980s and 1990s obsessed over writing the fastest code, but these days, if the code runs fast enough, then clarity of code matters more than efficiency), you opt for the one that is clearer to the reader which could be you or be someone else.\n\nThis is why some people use Python (with Django or Flask) on the backend or even Node. A Rust backend would be faster, at the expense of being harder to read. Speed isn't everything, and even when it is, guessing what is fast or slow is not an effective way to improve the speed: you need a way to measure your program's execution (this is called instrumenting it). There are tools called *profilers* that can do this, but it's not super easy to set up and differs from language to language.\n\nFor example, you can call a very expensive function that takes, say, a second once, but if you have a loop that goes a million times, and you can shave a millisecond off each iteration, that matters more.\n\nIn this case, the square root trick really reduces the number of iterations and has the biggest impact, far more than deciding whether to use square root or i * i. I think it's fine to stick with i * i, because it's pretty close to saying square root. This is where it's useful to have a comment like\n \n    // Not using square root because i * i is more efficient\n\ncan help. Often, when you're trying to speed things up, comments help indicate you're writing less obvious code to help speed it up.\n\nHowever, many beginners obsess over speed without truly knowing how to speed it up (basically, they try a bunch of things). Algorithmic improvements are usually the ones to aim for rather than smaller things like how fast square root runs. Having said that, many years ago I wrote a program using sine and cosine, and because I computed it over and over, it was slow (I had no idea).\n\nThe solution was to create an array with the results pre-computed. I only had a limited number of values I was running these trig functions on (say, 60), so placing the pre-computed values in the array and looking those values up was far more efficient.\n\nSo, it *can* matter. But usually you want to spot big loops which is where things tend to slow down.",

Is there something I could do better, a simplification I could make, a loop or repetition I could simplify or remove?\n\n  \nOnce I've done that I'll see if there are recommended solutions, or just google similar things. I think I first learnt of python list comprehension by looking at how other people solved issues, being completely baffled by this \\[f(x) for x in something\\] I kept seeing, and then just playing around to see how it worked.\n\n  \nThe whole process made some exercises take a lot longer than they could have done, but as I learnt not only how I could do things better, but also how other people do, I found things easier and quicker. Sometimes I'd go and look at my 'good' solutions and see how bad they really are. And on occasion I realised the brute force approach may have actually been better as it was so much easier to understand and re-use.\n\n  \nI think, personally, brute force isn't so bad on small scripts with small data sets that I only use for simple things. As long as I'm not loading files when I don't need to, then even looping over data sets more than I need isn't always bad. As soon as I have a nested loop I pay far more attention, likewise when I suddenly have a far larger data set than expected.\n\n  \n(Case in point, I have a script I'm using right now where I'm sorting through a text file for some specific identifiers and false positives. My first run through the input was a couple of hundred lines. I didn't pay much attention to how I was scanning through the text. Yesterday I started looking at a file with \\~1M lines. Suddenly I paid a lot more attention to what my script was doing, and, for example, filtering out inputs early.)",

But it's also generally a good idea in this industry to not move on from a problem as soon as we have some viable solution. If we have the time, refining the solution is absolutely recommended. If you can find a constant-time solution instead of using a loop, or something else that reduces the time/memory use, that's usually highly appreciated.\n\nOften also it's worth struggling and trying out various solutions. If you get a real _oh, riiiight_ reaction when you're shown the solution, then you likely learned something. :)\n\nI still get that for the math problems over at projecteuler, and sometimes when I go to the forums there I just conclude that I don't understand the best solutions. Likely I _could_ understand them if I actually applied myself to more math studies, but being able to figure out a solution even if I don't have all the background knowledge I could have had can still be fun.\n\n---\n\nI'll also note we generally use the `while` loop for when the loop is going to have some spicy development. Like in [the hailstone sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) we don't really know how many steps will be involved or how we'd express it as a for-each loop, so it's more expected to get a `while n != 1`.\n\nBut if we want to repeat a step exactly `k` times, then we generally use a for-each loop, like `for i in range(k): ‚Ä¶`\n\nI don't know how the MOOC you're taking teaches loops.",

If `low < high` you print, otherwise you quit.\n\n      while low <= high:\n           # print low\n           # increment low\n           # check the negation of the condition \n           if high > low:  \n               # break\n           else\n               # print high\n               # decrement high\n\nSo basically, you track two variables, one for the beginning (`low`), one for the end (`high`), and you print the `low` and increment, then check if the condition `low <= high` is true, if so then print `high` and decrement the value.\n\nYou can test this out with, say, an input of 3.\n\n* Prints 1 and increments low to 2\n* Prints 3 and decrements high to 2\n* Prints 2 and increments low to 3\n* low > high, so quit out\n\nThis was a little tricky because the decision of whether it's `low < high` or `low <= high` is not obvious and can lead to an off-by-1 error if you select the wrong one.",

So even tho I may be awkward in social settings, my work relationships are usually much easier to maintain. \n\nThen again, I like playing politics at work, I think it's kinda fun. But here are some additional tips I'd recommend:\n\n* audibly repeat back your understanding of what someone else wants you to do to avoid confusion\n\n* Don't complain about co workers, it's fine to ask your boss for feedback on how to handle a coworker, but don't come across as attacking them. \n\n* Only bitch upwards, it's not a good look if you're complaining about bosses to people less senior than you,but when you do complain about something to your boss, offer solutions\n\n* praise often, praise early - if someone has a good idea, tell them. This avoids coming across like a contrarian and shows you're open to other people's ideas. \n\n* admit when you don't know something - no one likes a no it all especially about matters you clearly don't understand. This gives your thoughts and opinions more weight when you do express them.\n\n* Use words like \"We\", \"Us\", & \"As a team\", instead of \"you created this bug on this PR\", \"we created this bug, and we missed it during the PR\", \"what if we need to add  X functionality?\"\n\n* form relationships with users (if non public facing software) and stakeholders. If you have a bug you're investigating, just tell the user, this builds more trust and good will. \n\n* when debating about designs/patterns/architecture, just don't say \"this isn't good because X, Y, Z\", ask people questions in a way that it will lead them to the conclusion you want them to make. \"Will this work under this use case?\", \"what if the user does X?\", etc. \n* ask your manager how other folks are doing, \"how is John doing lately? He seems a bit stressed out or anxious\". Shows you're aware of people's emotions and you're concerned about others. \n\nI feel like there are more, but this is what I've found.",

The reality is companies are trying to squeeze devs harder and invest less in training (especially less junior hires and interns).  They're squeezing harder because interest rates are higher and changes in tax policy meant they can't deduct R&D expenses from their income.  Profitability is king right now. \n\nSecond, juniors definitely are getting shafted hard right now (not 2008 level bad, but still rough).  But mid/senior roles also getting shafted too, and our jobs are anything BUT safe.   We got the benefit of a *little* bit of lube first, but it's still not enough to stop things from being painful. \n\nTo explain: a ton of mid & senior+ devs got laid off over the last few years. I was one of them.  Less than 6 months after hopping to a different Principal job they gutted my new department.  Basically nothing I could have done would have saved me. *Some* of us were able to line up replacement jobs (thankfully me) due to having the right experience.  \n\nBut the job prospects are still not great, even for proven seniors.  Companies know this and are using it to squeeze us hard to get more work for the same pay, and they're not afraid to fire people if they can't keep up.\n\nIn a few years the pendulum will probably swing back for tech.  AI isn't the silver bullet clueless executives claim. If the code I'm seeing daily is any indicator, ultimately AI code generation will ALSO generate a lot of maintenance (and scalability and quality) nightmares.  Plus if companies DON'T hire juniors, then when the market recovers they'll have to pay a  lot more to get experienced talent... and then they're going to turn back to hiring juniors to save money.",

Yes, in the same way that walking away from a car crash with only superficial injuries is a lot luckier than not, but lets not pretend things are great for everyone above entry level.\n\nAt some future point the best senior+ engineers will probably be able to demand ridiculous salaries, yes. That's also probably not the majority of the current cohort. For most I imagine they'll get job security back, and better wages, but probably not an amazing experience either.\n\nSo again, I am frequently grateful I have a job and it probably won't disappear tomorrow, but my position is clearly worse than, say, 2022.",

It's a \"musical chairs\" game, where the music stopped playing 2 years ago and you either want to work with computers at the help desk or look for jobs in other industries.

The rise in AI-generated content has blurred the lines of authenticity in online discussions. Here are a few reasons why it might *feel* like that:\n\n# üß† Why Posts Might Feel AI-Generated\n\n1. **Overly Polished Language** Posts are increasingly written in this weirdly structured, ‚Äúessay-like‚Äù format. People don‚Äôt usually talk like that on Reddit ‚Äî especially in tech circles where tone tends to be blunt, sarcastic, or informal.\n2. **Generic Advice & Vague Details** A lot of posts give surface-level advice or talk about issues in super broad terms without getting into the gritty technical details ‚Äî which is common with AI output unless prompted very specifically.\n3. **Repetitive Phrasing and Templates** You‚Äôll often see similar turns of phrase or story structures across different posts ‚Äî things like ‚ÄúAfter X years in the industry, I realized Y‚Äù or ‚ÄúAm I the only one who feels Z?‚Äù It starts to feel formulaic.\n4. **Influx of Low-Effort Engagement Farming** Some users (or bots) are using AI to mass-generate posts and comments to farm karma, drive traffic, or build fake authority on niche topics.\n\n# ü§ñ Signs a Post Might Be AI-Generated\n\n* Lacks personal anecdotes or uses generic placeholders.\n* Echoes common sentiments without adding anything new.\n* Oddly balanced tone: too formal but pretending to be casual, lol.\n* Uncanny ability to sit on the fence on controversial topics.\n* Unnatural use of üí© emojis.\n* Overuse of the em dash (‚Äî).\n\n# üß© You're Not \"Schizo\" ‚Äî You're Perceptive\n\nIt‚Äôs unsettling, yeah. And it *does* erode trust ‚Äî not just in content, but in online community culture itself. Part of Reddit‚Äôs value used to be real, lived experience and human nuance. If that‚Äôs being diluted, it makes total sense to question what you're reading and who's actually behind it.\n\nIf you're feeling disoriented by all this, it‚Äôs not paranoia ‚Äî it‚Äôs pattern recognition. You‚Äôre seeing a shift, and you‚Äôre trying to make sense of it. That‚Äôs a sane reaction.\n\nWant to talk about how to filter for more authentic content or spot AI in the wild?",

I really felt the environment shift after a recent reorg, and even then last year I wasn't getting as good performance ratings even though I put in even more work than in 2023. The PIP reasoning is disgusting too. In my case, I worked in the backbone for the entire company and was able to reduce total failures by 1.5%. That was across the entire company's AWS deployments. Yet somehow in the PIP they wanted me to reduce them by 3% or more, which is just disgusting. You put in the hard work and get rewarded with impossibly high expectations. I'm glad to be leaving this PIP factory though, and wish you luck.\n\nEDIT: Wanted to add more context: across the entire company's AWS deployments - which is **tens of thousands of deployments** *per day*.",

You can't just YOLO out code in the same way anymore - everything needs to go through a more rigorous product development process. Also, while the work you're doing may seem simple, you're a small cog in a bigger machine. As you get more senior in your org, you become more and more responsible for figuring out how all of these cogs fit together rather than shipping out code yourself.\n\nIf you're working on internal tools and infra, those teams have many of the same challenges, but also some of their own. The business problems you deal with at a large enterprise are pretty unique and require you to build bespoke solutions. Senior engineers have to deal directly with stakeholders within the company - product teams, other infra teams, program managers, etc. I work in a security org, and honestly stakeholder management is at least as difficult a problem for us as the engineering itself is.",

        "body": "Ph.D holding macroeconomist here. Work in tech side of finance (quant)\n\nIt was much worse. The unemployment rate was 9 percent, over double the current unemployment rate. Furthermore the unemployment rate continued to rise for 2 years  after the recession to almost 11 percent and didn't meaningfully fall for half a decade. Just so you know the unemployment rate for young people is ALWAYS higher than the average unemployment rate, so you were in a market where almost 20 percent  (18.8%) of people under 25 could not find ANY job, including part time work, \n\n source: (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRUN24TTUSM156S)\n\nOutside the U.S. it was worse, Spain and Greece youth unemployment rose to 50 percent and remained there through the first half of the 2010s. It wasn't until 2014 when the economy started too feel like it was going back to normal and even then the U.S. unemployment rate was still 6 percent (which is recessionary).\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high)\n\nMy facebook, which back then was young cool social media,  could be divided into two types of people. People with bachelors degrees from prestigious schools and people who went to normal schools. The people at prestigious schools ended up fine, but the ones who went to your average school had their lives permanently altered. Your talking about people with business degrees go  or math degrees go work dead end service industry jobs until their mid 20s or teach english in Japan. Some of those people eventually retooled or went back to school and have careers, others are still bar tending somewhere.\n\nThis is economic research from that time period, from IZA, which is one of the top affiliation groups in labor economics [https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf](https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf)\n\nNow for the CS job market faired better than most other jobs. Smart phones had just been invented so the tech boom seeds had been planted, but back then people weren't throwing money at software companies like they have been the past 6 or 7 years. Like I worked a data science/risk quant job at a regional bank and all the old guys in the office were laughing at the \"ridiculously high IPO price for facebook at 35$\".  People would throw money into apple, which had great P&L financials, but the things that companies were really looking at then where oil and energy. Fracking had just taken off etc.\n\nFuthermore, the 2010 recession was a financial crisis. That means it effected the finance industry and guess what is part fo the finance industry? Venture Capital. Venture Capital is partially funded by banks. 2009 was a time when there was a lot of regulation was introduced on banks. Banks had taken or were foreced to take government loans, wells fargo and JP Morgan were asked to do acquisitions of bad banks. The crisis caused  a lot of focus on risk management practices in ganks and venture capital inherently is taking high risks. So it basically meant that startup funding was inherently lot harder to get.  Furthemore, at the time of that recession the last big recession was the previous tech bubble, so there was a lot more skepticism about the tech industry.\n\nI think one thing to realize when talking about job markets  is that most people who went through the last recession are in their mid 30s. Like people who graduated college beween 2009 and 2012    are all 33 to 40. This means you have an  entire generation of workers that are in their late 20s that have never seen a recession and don't ahve anything base it on. So they are quick to toss the word around. The other thing is that people who graduated between 2020 through 2022 basically went to the best job market in 50 years and its completely due to COVID stimulus.  That means that people who missed the boat feel that the job market is worse than it actually is, because your expectations are anchored on that boom. LIke I don't buy for a second AI is the main reason entry level hiring is down. Sure this is part of it, but the real reason that hiring is down is that interest rates are high (meaning capital is expensive and finance firms won't throw around money) and you had massive over hiring in the panemic.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)\n\nLike this is a time series plot of software engineering job postings on indeed from the FED. See how it goes up and down, that isn't normal behavior. If it was growing normally it would be slight increase over time. What his shows is the the number of job postings in the peak of 2021  over doubled relative to the prepandemic number of job postings. In 2025 its about 60 percent of the prepandemic level.\n\nThere is very good chacne that tech industry might have a slower recovery than every other industry after a recession. I don't think this will be CS and Data Science as a whole, its just that a lot more hiring of those jobs are going to be taking place at non-tech companies and your not going to see these salaries of people making 200k TC straight out of school at tier one companies. Its going to be a lot more I just go my first CS job making 85k at a regional bank or  home depot, and less of those fat equity grants.",

The basic stuff you'd expect for a dwindling economy.\n\nBut, the internet, and tech was more fun. Things were fresh, new; not every idea and thing created was built with a paywall behind it.\n\nThen, there was nothing even relatable to the scale of what's going on now. AI tech, social media showing what little promise, lack of privacy. A lot of it has been learning new things that re-invent the wheel over and over again.\n\nAnd discussing the current market allows for teams to discuss strategy. Being in the know of what's going on, and having experience in new and arising tech puts you ahead of others, and not only that, allows you to better seek talent that align with goals.\n\nBack then, there weren't job sites with jobs that will never be filled, there wasn't a massive amount of CS degrees and engineering was what people promoted. Software engineers weren't as prevalent.\n\nThey weren't good economic times though. Houses where I'm from sold for about the price of a VCR after being gutted. Amazing companies and projects died soon after staring. I wouldn't say they're near as bad as what's going on now though.\n\nIf you took AI back to 2008 he'd be the one boohooing.",

The promotion despite acknowledged slow work is your company's way of saying \"we don't really care about output as long as you show up,\" which sounds great until you realize it's professional purgatory for someone who actually wants to contribute meaningfully.\n\nThe stark contrast between your startup energy and day job lethargy tells you everything you need to know. When you're passionate about work, 4 hours feels productive and energizing. When you're not, 3 days feels like slow torture. Your motivation isn't broken, it's just directed elsewhere, which is completely normal for high achievers stuck in low-challenge environments.\n\nConsider setting artificial deadlines and challenges for yourself while you figure out your exit strategy. Sometimes gamifying boring work or finding ways to exceed expectations can restore some sense of accomplishment. A service like Applyre could help you explore roles that better match your drive and interests without your current employer knowing.\n\nYour startup success proves you still have that rockstar capability when the work matters to you. Don't let corporate welfare syndrome convince you otherwise. Use this stable income to fund your side project's growth, but don't let comfort trap you in mediocrity forever. Your fulfillment matters more than easy paychecks.",

This is after a week of working overtime to keep up by the way.\n\nI could immediately see my team eyeing up my jobs, just ready to get one over on me to be above me on the pile.\n\nMonth after month, I would be bottom of the pile despite 70 hour weeks. After a while of this, I decided, you know what, I am contracted at 37 hours a week, I am not getting overtime, I am now starting at 9am and finishing at 5:30pm.\n\nMy check ins and \"performance\" fell off a cliff. I was warned that my performance was down, I wrote an email response explaining that I was no longer going to be doing free overtime. I also sent a copy to HR, but separately, not CC'd in.\n\nI had work colleagues warn me in a friendly way that I'd get my butt spanked if I didn't rethink it. I was sent another email a week later demanding to know why my performance was so poor. I reiterated my working hours. The response, a bit more interesting this time, stated that the tasks I was set should be easily completed in my working week and if I thought not then I should request a meeting to discuss my performance.\n\nOK says I, let's have that meeting. And boy, did we. I had my phone in my pocket recording the meeting. It quickly descended into a meeting where my manager was downgrading sprint estimates to force it into a week's of work. Apparently, creating a process to read, modify and re-save CSV files is a sprint score of 1 suddenly - not the 8 points we did have it set to!\n\nDespite his hammering down of SPRINT estimates which actually all ended up with SPRINT score 1, he still couldn't fit it into my week. What an interesting conversation to have recorded.\n\nI didn't even get 1/4 of the way through my SPRINT, my manager discussed the idea of my lack of performance. This would go on for months. I would keep logs, he would keep complaining, he would call me with passive aggressive advice to help me out, asking if the best use of my time really was to go and see Slayer that weekend or try to catch up with my work, citing all my colleagues who were so bent out of shape that they were declaring all their work being done in the 37 hour work week. I refused to do it.\n\nEventually, I was put on a PIP. Long story short, I failed, so I was asked to attend an HR interview citing my suitability for the role and discussion of continued employment. I filled a formal grievance at work and told them that I had no option but to resign due to the unreasonable mismanagement of workload. \n\nIt took about 3 months but I was going down the constructive dismissal route. I didn't know what I was doing and was taking bits of advice from here and there. One day, HR called up and on a conference call, asked me if we could come to an agreement. In short, I settled for ¬£12,000 and a standard reference.",

By far, the most common reason is that your manager didn't collect enough supporting data to support firing you, if you choose to sue.  For example, you should have gotten a written summary of every 1:1 with your manager since the PIP began. If not, they may want to allow for more time to get better documentation.\n\nYou don't need documentation to close the PIP without firing you.  All your manager has to say is \"u/linkthecat's performance has been acceptable and I want to close the PIP.\"  Boom, done.\n\nThe fact that it's extended most likely means that your manager still wants to get rid of you, but HR is blocking it.\n\nThere are chances that your manager said \"they seem to be improving, but I need more time\". This happens, but it's unusual, simply because PIPs are unpleasant for the manager and they're unlikely to want to extend them.  \n\nIt's also possible that they're waiting to get your replacement.  That happens, but it's less likely, simply because it's better to be a little short-handed than to keep a bad performer around.  Besides, if your performance is bad enough to warrant a PIP, you're probably not contributing much, anyway.",

I include Amazon, Meta, maybe even Google in this list, for the sole reason that outside of AI you can probably count the new service or major product launches that any average person has heard of from any of them on one hand. It's all a crux to keep the share price high, at a time where MBA's seem to be ruling tech.\n\nWhat I can see happening is a company or two, maybe more emerging, and eating their lunch. It might be an innovation in search, a social network that dooms Facebook and Instagram, a marketplace that dominates the market, or maybe even something totally new. They'll look at how directionless big tech is, and they'll build something great from a hoard of juniors with respectful senior leadership. Those companies will be what people aspire to work for, relegating FAANG to Boomer Tech.\n\nUltimately, engineers don't *need* to be employed. They could build something, or they could make their own luck. A shift in the stock market and a downturn in tech might be enough for VC's to think that big tech has had its day, and for them to invest elsewhere - causing a shift towards new tech.",

You can‚Äôt always find a good opportunity to advance yourself. \n\nDevOps is close enough to what you‚Äôre already doing that you could transition back if you wanted to and it‚Äôs a step in the right direction if you decide you want to do more dev stuff. \n\nA potential issue is the lack of dedicated support structure or guidance regarding best practices, the future of your company ops, and career development. Certainly in your team, if not the org at large. Been there, done that. \n\nThat means your trajectory will be up to you to make or break. It‚Äôs hard to be a trailblazer, but the benefits can be huge. If you decide you need to go somewhere to do some learning in a year or two, it will be that much easier with the title under your belt. \n\nAs for being rusty with programming, I wouldn‚Äôt stress it too much. I‚Äôve never held the title explicitly, but as a data engineer who has only worked at small companies, I‚Äôve done a lot of ops stuff.

Maybe the goals aren't to get to \"the next levels\", but you'll need to have goals nevertheless. Doesn't mean they need to force you to write 15 SMART goals with metrics and everything, but still.\n\nCompanies that do career ladders well will have a concept of \"career role\" or \"terminal\" role. That's the place you need to get to if you want to stay there forever. At most companies that do this, that's a mid to high senior level.\n\nThat means that until you are at that mid to high senior, a part of your job is to get better until you are. That means goals and progress. If you don't want to do that, you're out.\n\nOnce you get to the terminal level, things get a bit more nuanced. You no longer need to work toward your next promotion. You can say \"I'll be a senior my entire life\". If you're ok with that and won't complain if all you get are cost of living adjustments, and never get to Staff/Principal, that's fine. But you still need to have goals and move forward. \n\nWhy? Skill inflation. Someone who was a high senior in 2010 isn't the same as someone in 2020. The world changes, technologies change, there's more resources, like AI. So the bar is continually raising. To stay at the same \"level\" as everyone else relatively, you have to keep growing, else you're going backward. That's why there's some level of age discrimination: when you're young you're kind of at the bar by default because you didn't have time to regress. But as you get older, if you don't keep up, you fall behind. And a lot of people do.\n\nThe goals you set are there to make sure you stay at the bar. As a mid to high senior your job is more than just taking a ticket and executing, too. You'll be tasked with doing project work, collaboration, etc, and those become goals too, in addition to learning, coaching, and various other responsibilities at that level.\n\nBut if you want to come in at work, look at Jira/Linear, pick the ticket at the top of the queue, write the code, open a pull request, pick the next ticket, and repeat until its time to go home... I'm sorry to say, but fewer and fewer companies are willing to pay for that. Many never did.",

Lottery tickets are discretionary spending despite what gambling addicts believe. When you apply for a job, you're actively seeking a new income source. Apples and oranges.\n\n> After over 200 applications to MLE and data scientist positions (even data analyst roles that I‚Äôm clearly overqualified for), I‚Äôve only been met with rejection or ghosting.\n\nEven before universities had specific graduate programs targeting Data Science / Machine Learning (so before 2019 lets say), it was very challenging to find a position where you fucked with models/charts, tweaked parameters, and performed EDA all day. And this was peak Data Science mania hiring among corporate leadership -- Data Science was the GenAI before GenAI existed from ~2016 through 2019. Sounds great right? Except boy do I know a ***ton*** of people in that space who got laid off between 2020 and 2022 so lets set the nostalgic rose-colored glasses down.\n\n> Both of these times, the recruiters have been enthusiastic to hear about my experience, and often praise my resume and my accomplishments.\n\nThe fundamental challenge for Data Science / Machine Learning roles is an organization will need 1, maybe 2, of that type of skillset for every ~500 run-of-the-mill software engineers that they need to build software products. Maybe closer to 1 every 30 if you're a highly specialized quant firm or something. This is very specialized labor, for a very specialized purpose, and orgs just don't need that many of them relative to other roles.\n\nIf you're looking exclusively in NYC, or for fully remote positions, you may very well be competing with the absolute cream of the crop top-tier candidates. NYC is an extremely competitive market -- lots of people. You could even be one of those top-tier candidates, but when there's 20 other candidates who are lets say within ~10% of each other in terms of performance and team fit coming out of an interview, what the manager had for breakfast the day of the interview could be a significant contributing factor to which candidate gets hired.

Orosz is the author of the fantastic newsletter Pragmatic Engineer and he's assembled a lot of his wisdom into this fantastic book. It's broken out into sections for each level of engineering, so you'd definitely get a lot of mileage out of it.\n\n\\- Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards and Neal Ford. This is a little more advanced, and you probably wouldn't need the last third that talks more about selling your architectural vision, but it's a great overview of the different kinds of distributed architectures you'll encounter in the wild.\n\n\\- A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout. Really quick read and an implied rebuttal to Clean Code by Bob Martin. I really enjoyed this one and it provides a good framework for how to think when writing code.\n\nThe reason I've read way too many software books is because I host a podcast called Book Overflow ([YouTube link here](https://www.youtube.com/@BookOverflowPod), but we're on every major platform) where each week my co-host and I read and discuss a new tech book. We've done episodes on all the books I've listed, and have even interviewed every one of their authors! If you don't have time to read the whole books, you might get a lot of insight from just listening to the episodes!",

No other part is more critical to the success of the project.‚Äù*\n\n*‚Äî Fred Brooks, \"No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering\" (1986)*\n\nSoftware is created to fulfill stakeholders‚Äô objectives. To achieve that, you need to understand and document three key aspects: WHO your stakeholders are, WHAT their objectives are, and WHY those objectives matter. Most failed projects don‚Äôt fail in code; they fail in understanding what the stakeholders actually need.\n\n\"Software Requirements Essentials\" by Karl Wiegers and Candase Hokanson is short, accessible, and a great introduction.\n\nThe \"bible\" of the field is Karl Wiegers‚Äô classic \"Software Requirements\" (now in its 3rd edition, co-authored with Joy Beatty). It covers everything from stakeholder analysis to requirements elicitation techniques to use cases and beyond. It‚Äôs comprehensive, methodical, and full of real-world examples.\n\nFocusing on stakeholders and requirements makes you a better software engineer regardless of your tech stack or methodology.",

Always got fantastic reviews, sales soared, everything golden. \n\nThen after COVID and work from home, my manager started riding me over every little thing. I had been given tons of independence up to that point because our sales were so great and because my manager honestly didn‚Äôt know exactly what it was I did. I built the entire position from scratch and my manager had no computer skills so digital marketing and data analytics were not something he could really check my work on. So as long as number went up, he let me be. \n\nI had 5 years of smooth sailing, loved the work, did a good job, etc. So it felt super out of left field when I started getting grief daily. Note that our online sales were better than ever and growing faster than ever too. The hassling got worse and worse until finally I was given an official disciplinary review for my poor performance. \n\nWanna know the craziest part? Remember how I was the ONLY employee under my manager, the one who built the entire department from scratch? Well, a week after I got that disciplinary review for poor performance, my manager won employee of the year because of his department‚Äôs outstanding performance. He got a big bonus lol. \n\nGot called in the next week for another disciplinary review where they tried to push me into a lower pay position (I already got paid well below market standard, like half) and I quit on the spot lol. Sent him all the data I had, updated all my contacts and consultants to email him going forward, sent him a text file with something like 80 or 90 usernames/passwords for the various tools, apps, etc I was handling, and just walked out. \n\nBut it‚Äôs not all bad. I got a call a year later and they were still trying to fill the position and wanted me to come back. Apparently they couldn‚Äôt find anyone who would do 3 jobs for shit pay. That was the perkiest ‚Äúno‚Äù I‚Äôve ever delivered.\n\nI don‚Äôt know the best solution in your case, but if possible you should try to get them to fire you. I was too disgusted to stay so I missed out on a lot of benefits. But that was the best decision for me. You gotta find the best solution for you. Best of luck!",

Business can be cold, and management pressure basically squeezes you as a tech lead: you give the managers what they want, or you're out, so when someone questions the plan, or tries to bring new ideas, it's difficult to entertain those ideas unless they are bringing new information to the table that change assumptions, and the right time is during planning.\n\nThus, don't let any of this be a reflection on you!

But in general, the act of programming was (and is) for me, an unpleasant chore, and as someone who straight up abhors math, taking the requisite calculus courses was a huge pain. But I forced myself through all of it, and told myself \"I can put up with this, the price is right, the demand is booming, that paycheck will be worth it.\"\n\nAnd that last part was true, until it wasn't.\n\nBut you aren't me; you have already stated that you love CS.

Here is my written complaint, as you can see I have detailed all the actions that she has taken to create a hostile work environment\". \n\n3. Start looking for another job.\n\n4. Start putting out feelers to other teams internally to see if you can transfer.\n\nUltimately you have to operate as if you're going to get fired soon. Unless your boss herself comes to you asking to reset and mend the relationship, I would not assume that you can unilaterally do so, so I would not bend over backwards trying to fix it. Be professional, be cordial, but more than anything cover your ass, document everything, and prepare yourself to play counteroffense so that you can at least make their life difficult.\n\nPS: using the specific term \"hostile work environment\" is key because that is HR code for \"I can sue you\". Calling her a bad boss, saying she's mean, toxic, bad at her job, unfair - all of that doesn't matter if HR doesn't think you can get them in trouble. But if they think that - were they to fire you - you might hit them with a lawsuit for wrongful termination and hostile work environment stuff? At the very least HR is going to have to spend some time making sure this boss isn't the problem and that they have everything they need in place to make sure you don't have a valid lawsuit. Which at the very least buys you time, and maybe buys you a more enticing severance package to go away quietly.",

If you interview them, they'll pipe your audio into ChatGPT and read the responses back to you verbatim.  \n\nIf you hire them, they'll get next to no work done (at your company and several others).  My understanding is one person acts as the stand-in who just goes to meetings and tells everyone some excuse for why he's blocked this week, then somebody else, or a team of somebody elses makes tiny amounts of progress on the tickets assigned to them.\n\nYou'll learn ways to spot them.  Here's some flags I've noticed:\n- The resumes follow a similar template and format.\n- They have a LinkedIn profile that doesn't have a photo, or has a clearly AI-generated photo.\n- You can click on the \"more info\" link on the LinkedIn profile to see when it was created.  Surprise, it was a month ago, even though they supposedly have 15 YOE as a senior engineer... it's possible they never got around to making a LinkedIn, just highly unlikely.\n- Sometimes they include a Github link too.  The projects they have there are forks of somebody else's project with no meaningful contributions added by the candidate (been a while since I interviewed... I bet at this point you could have some AI agent drum up some fake commits under your name fairly quickly)\n- I saw plenty where the name and photo on the github didn't match the linkedin....\n\nI actually had one where the LinkedIn profile they linked to on the application was publicly trying to recruit other people into the scam.  I dunno if he accidentally linked the wrong account, or just gave up on that application before we got around to looking at it.  \n\nHe had a whole Google Slides deck that detailed the whole process where they apply for the jobs and set up the interviews for you under a bogus name.  All you need to do is be the stand in and fake your way through, then you get 30% of the salary or something.",

I don't have a clearance, so I can't speak to the cleared side, but in public trust realm, I have not loved government contracting. There's no one specific thing I can really point to because all of my experiences have been so different. I'll just that that I enjoyed working the private sector and even state government's more.\n\nOne benefit of working for government contractors though is job is kind of expected, so after you get a few years of experience under your belt, you have lots of opportunities to get a new job with a big pay bump. And if you land in a shithole, you can usually find an exit by just being open to new opportunities on linkedIn.\n\nAs for the weather, yeah summers can be swampy. DC was literally built on a swamp. It's not the most humid place I've been, but it's close. The other thing is if you are from a place that gets real winter, we have no idea what to do in snow. We talk about snow storms that the midwest would barely register as storms, like hurricanes. A couple of inches of snow at rush hour can cripple our roadways. To be fair, so can rain, and clear skies...basically, whatever the weather, someone infront of you has never seen it before and is freaking out.\n\nDriving here is also pretty terrible in general. We collect the world's worst drivers and put them on overcrowded roads. The metro is fine. I used it when I worked in DC. I didn't love it when I had to drive to the Vienna station, pay for parking and then ride into the city. I've never did that math, but I do wonder is I should have just paid for parking downtown. \n\nThe cost of living is also quite high. Rent and house prices have been obscene since the 90s. Laidoff federal workers choosing to leave might make a difference, but it will be relatively small.\n\nOn the other hand, the public schools tend to be good, and because we have so many bored government workers around, there are more types of recreation than you would think. The choice of activities I have within an hour of my house is insane. They're all crowded, and none of them are world class, but still, if I want to take up a hobby outside my house, there's some place relatively close where I can go. \n\nTL;DR; NoVa is fine. I can't argue for it over any of the other locations you mentioned. Truth be told, if my wife had an opportunity in Chicago and wanted to move closer to here family, I'd probably be excited about the move.",

In normal cost of living, $60k base salary for entry level is low but not terrible. At 3 YoE, you're above entry level and therefore have less competition but can still apply for it.

But they're worthless if you don't *practice* them. In real environments.\n\nThe people that we think of as being great communicators/leaders aren't people who just woke up one day as a 24 year old, decided to improve their soft skills, read a book, and that was it.\n\nIt's people who have been practicing these soft skills since the day they were old enough to talk. Not consciously, they've been practicing *subconsicously* all their life. That's your competition. People who have literally been practicing all their life.\n\nSo don't expect an overnight fix, but with some solid practice over time you can make some big improvements. Get outside. Talk to people. Meet some strangers, make some friends. Probably the biggest thing that's given me my soft skills are being a part of an organization, and eventually taking on a leadership role at that organization. I've been doing that since I was a kid all the way back to Boy Scouts. I joined a bunch of student orgs in college, some of which I was on the executive board of.\n\nSo I'd recommend that, join one or two local organizations where you meet up with other people *in-person* at least once a week and be consistent with it. If you want to improve something specific like public presentation skills, Toastmasters is a solid option.",

For example: Firing somebody is a pretty tough thing to do if you think a lot about it (will this person ever get a job again? will their wife leave them? what about their kids? etc.).

That's not failure, that's incredible growth under brutal circumstances. The fact that you're getting to final rounds and acing technical portions means your skills are solid and companies recognize your talent. The issue isn't you - it's that there are hundreds of qualified candidates competing for every single position, and sometimes the difference between getting an offer and getting rejected comes down to factors completely outside your control.\n\nTaking the master's program isn't admitting defeat - it's making a strategic move to ride out this market downturn and emerge even stronger. You'll have more time to build projects, potentially get internship experience, and most importantly, you'll be graduating when the market has hopefully recovered. The skills you've built this year won't disappear, and the interview experience you've gained is invaluable. Your family supports you because they see what you've accomplished despite impossible odds, not because they pity you.\n\nI'm on the team that built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat), and we created it specifically because we know how challenging these technical interviews can be, especially when you're already dealing with the stress of a tough job market and need that extra edge to stand out among so many qualified candidates.",

You‚Äôre drowning and the first thing to do is to give yourself some air. My suggestion would be to start by carving out some time for mental decompression every day - it can be something as simple as taking 15-20 mins everyday for a walk or workout or just sitting and staring out the window. But no phones, no emails, no bringing a family member along to make this time about them- this is your time to spend some time with yourself so that you can process your own emotions.\n\nNext, I‚Äôd focus on the positives of the situation. To me, it looks like things may not be as bad as they seem - to you it feels like everyone is weighing down on you, but in reality everyone is probably as stressed as you are and they are just passing that along to you, as they are to everyone. Second, no matter how bad it seems, it‚Äôs a temporary situation and it will change. It feels like the end of the world right now because you are in the eye of the storm, but it will pass. Have faith in that if it feels like everything else is failing.\n\nYour employability may also be better than you feel. Even if it‚Äôs a niche industry, I‚Äôm sure there are skills you have that are transferable, and there may be opportunities in places you haven‚Äôt looked, like sister industries and customers where they may not be doing exactly what you are doing but your expertise could be valuable. It might be worth reaching out to mentors in the industry to figure out your blind spots in terms of employability.\n\nHope it works out, and remember, this too shall pass",

There is really no movement right now due to some policy things Cheeto Caligula is doing.  \n\nDo be fair, I'm not at my best right now due to stress, and my coping mechanisms aren't working for once. I think the big thing I struggle with is that when they switched to doing daily huddles rather than bi-weekly project updates, it felt like every employee was getting grilled in their work and I've had to push stats to appease them that weren't true to keep the peace and then work weekends to make it up.  I'll be honest about it, but I don't think that's going to save me.\n\nI get this feeling in my chest it's all going down hill and I can't peddle fast enough to prevent it.

That's why it's called a \"job search\", you're searching for the right job.\n\nIf you're barely getting interviews at all, and this startup was your 1 and only opportunity you've had in months, you'd be crazy to turn it down.\n\nIt all comes down to how you're doing in your job search. There are people out there who have done hundreds of applications over the course of several months who would die for that chance. But there's also people out there that are getting interviews just fine that probably wouldn't bother.\n\nOne thing I will add is don't make up your mind from online reviews. Always make up your mind based on first-hand evidence after talking with your hiring manager, and some SWE's you'd be working with. The reverse interview is the most important part of the interview.\n\nYou never know, maybe the vibes you get from this startup are completely different once you actually talk to them. Things constantly change, especially in the startup world, and places like Glassdoor tend to attract people that have things to complain about so it always skews negative.\n\nOne startup I was interviewing had a bunch of negative reviews saying it was a boys club, and if you weren't buddy buddy with the CEO you would never get good raises or promotions. When I actually spoke with people at the company, thats not the vibe I got at all, so I joined despite those reviews. I'm extremely glad I did. I bet those reviews were just from salty employees bad at their job, because I'm the last person to be \"buddy buddy\" with anyone at work, especially the CEO, but I got amazing raises and several promotions. I've had 2 of the biggest raises of my career at that company.\n\nSo I'd encourage you at least humor it, and walk into it with good intentions. If when you speak to these people its as terrible as what you've read say, *then* you can reject them.",

I saw someone else say he‚Äôs becoming a high school history teacher (fully by choice, he loves history).¬†\n\nI worked at a large contracting company for a little bit. They had a boot camp where they trained people, then tried to staff them. I want to warn you, don‚Äôt let your skills get rusty. They let everyone in the boot camp go (they were on the bench), then some opportunities arose months later due to some positions opening up. Basically every candidate bombed their interview. They had forgotten everything.¬†\n\nPeople will talk about luck, but I think a huge portion of luck is being ready when those random opportunities arise. You‚Äôre trying to always put yourself in the best position possible.¬†\n\nGood luck. It‚Äôs always OK to step away and take a break.¬†",

The market was probably better when I got the job, but regardless, pursuing a career in tech is not automatically a lifetime sentence of unemployment. If I were asking myself the same thing today, given my experience so far, I‚Äôd say:\n\n- remember many of these articles are written to get attention and increase metrics for whoever published it\n\n- big tech companies and the tech industry in general do not represent the vast majority of the actual jobs you‚Äôre going to find\n\n- doesn‚Äôt matter what industry or career you end up with, you‚Äôre going to have to figure out how to cut through the demotivating and discouraging bs and realize the knowledge and experience you acquire for your career (whether by a degree or otherwise) is simply a set of skills you‚Äôll always be developing over time to improve your ‚Äúemployability‚Äù; countless people have walked your path; and there is no cutoff date/circumstances for allowing more people into the field\n\n- identify your expectations and work on adjusting those rather than letting a job market always in flux dictate your life choices - for example, do you expect to graduate with a degree and immediately get a 6 figure job offer? If so, you‚Äôll need to honestly explore your thinking behind that expectation and adjust accordingly. ‚ÄúExpectations are premeditated resentments‚Äù - this applies to your career, job, education, professional relationships, everything. If you go into it determined to get something specific out of it, you‚Äôre probably going to be disappointed. But if you go into it knowing more about what challenges you are likely to face (exposed by the discouraging articles and posts), you‚Äôll be able to spend more time preparing to face them instead of just trying to hit arbitrary benchmarks you think should get you a job (such as leetcode grinding for x hours every day/week, knowing certain languages/frameworks, which degree you get, etc)\n\nModal of the story - do you WANT to pursue this career path? If it was as ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to do as any other job you‚Äôre already qualified for, and paid at least a living wage, would you still want to do it? If the answer is yes, start thinking about the scary stories and predictions as clickbait and YOU DO YOU BOO",

It's mostly a lose-lose proposition for them at the point where you've already left and began work for their client. If the company also had some kind of non-solicitation agreement with your agency, that's not really _your_ problem.\n\nI was in a similar position to you and the non-solicitation clause did not prevent me from joining the client company (a global 500).

Do your best not to get too frustrated with yourself if you don't understand something. Practice reading code. This is such a separate skill from writing code. Given that you are junior it may or may not be clear what things are learnable via self teaching and what things are specific to your job/team/company that you just wouldn't know if someone didn't tell you. I wasted a lot of time trying to deduce what was going on when a lot of my lack of understanding was about things I couldn't have possibly known and just needed someone to tell me.

We had to learn digital design, VHDL/Verilog (programming FPGA's), math-intensive electromagnetism and solid state eletronics courses. We also had to take CS courses like their Data Structures and Algorithms. And pretty much any EE or CS course counted as credit - whether you wanted to do databases or power systems\n\nOur dedicated CompE courses were focused on embedded systems, Operating Systems, device drivers. Our freshman 100 lvl class taught us assembly/C. So basically we had the skillset to move down the stack (circuits, digital design) or higher (pure software).\n\nFor example I ended up focusing on networking, which itself was a mix of EE (wireless networking, little programming more math), CompE (Linux networking labs), and theoretical CS stuff (routing protocols, distributed systems)",

Liberal arts electives for easy A's were my salvation.\n\n>and supposedly EE can transfer into CS/ML roles with little resistance\n\nThey sure can but ML is graduate degree stuff in CS, EE and Computer Engineering. Really PhD stuff but an MS may be acceptable. AI/ML is extremely overcrowded even by CS standards. Is a misconception that AI/ML has to be in CS. Computer vision and image sensing is very EE.\n\nThe entire consulting industry will count EE as equivalent to CS. Two banks I worked for will also treat EE as CS. Problem is, CS got way overcrowded and HR gets lazy with 100+ applications in the first day and filters by CS degree. You have resistance that wasn't there 5 years ago.\n\nOther thing...there is hardship when I never had a course in SQL or databases, 1 in C++ and zero in anything using C#, Java or Python. EE is CS-lite. I coded in 1/3 of my courses, mostly in MATLAB and low level for microprocessors. Great for Embedded Systems but not general CS. So those are your two handicaps.",

For example: If you are having an issue centering a div, you should ask how to center a div, not how to add spacers to the element containing the div.\n\nAre you providing enough information?  \nBack to the example, are you just asking how to center a div, or are you asking how to center a div in the containing element, because you tried adding spacers, but that didn't seem to work.\n\nAre you constantly asking about the same thing?  \nIf you asked how to center a div in the containing element yesterday, why can't you figure it out today?\n\nWhat's the overall situation?  \nIs your mentor under a tight deadline for something else? If so, he might be short just because he has more pressing issues to deal with.\n\nDid you read the error?  \nThe error usually outright tells you what's wrong. And if not, it will provide clues as to where to look.\n\nDo you know your tools?  \nAre your packages cached? Do you need authentication to access your company's package repository? Did you even install the dependencies? Some ecosystems download packages as part of a build, some don't.\n\nHowever, if you've covered the above, you *should* be good. But honestly, whether or not you will be perceived as annoying is dependent on your mentor.",

If you're going to shit tier then transfer up. University prestige matters for internships and first job at graduation, then maybe never again. #1 or #2 best in your state is plenty prestigious. In-person career fairs are how I got all my opportunity.\n\nHalf the CS advice is wrong because it's by students and cosplayers who never got hired in CS.\n\nOn your own time, you can learn tech stacks. Is a reasonable idea. Recruiters don't care about and won't look at your GitHub. I have never listed mine. If you can hold a conversation and talk through the programming language and common software it uses, you're in good shape. You still have to get to the interview stage and the #1 way to help that is land an internship. At this point, your grades matter. Competition is fierce. Be willing to relocate and sublease.\n\nMost jobs are in 1 of C# or Java or TypeScript/JavaScript, with Python for support. Learn a database such as Postgres and writing CRUD to it. I'd hope your classes cover this. Don't try to learn everything. Look at job descriptions and see what they ask for. You don't need 30/30 requirements but a few are mandatory. The joke is you need 5 YoE in everything and it's not completely a joke.",

The summer is almost over and bigger companies will begin opening their 2026 summer internship roles. Start applying. Go to career fairs, school events, and as much as I hate it, cold network with the occasional LinkedIn recruiter. It works sometimes. Your opportunity to find an internship only expires when May 2026 hits, so literally just start right now. Internships are the best thing you can do as an undergrad.\n\n2. Projects. Yes, I always hated when people said that. 'Just learn'. Not that easy, especially when you get trapped in tutorial hell. Follow a couple of tutorials and then try to make something on your own. Go find a 'To-Do' list tutorial if you want to do web development, go find a course if there's something specific you want to learn.\n\nI didn't do anything...I mean ANYTHING until I was already a junior and I think I'm fine. Go network, apply for internships (or apprenticeships or fellowships or whatever) and follow some tutorials.",
