Most posts in this sub are slanted toward the US market, which is extremely tough for those just starting out.  Those at the senior level, like many of us here, will not have any issue finding work - networking alone being a game changer. Then there is the issue of soft skills versus technical skills.  The longer you have been in the workforce, the more likely you are to have honed the soft skills needed for interviews.  There are many relatively new DE's that are technically proficient but, due to a host of reasons (don't get me started), do not have the skills to interview well.\n\n I've also decided to ignore my impulse to see everything as LLM-generated.  I've personally written a few work proposals where I've been accused of such (no silly graphics or bullet points btw), and those that use LLMs are the first to assume everything written now is the same.  I also have family where English isn't their primary language, so it can often be used for translation, and the user is left with terrible formatting.",

I have taken raw, messy streaming data and spoon fed these analysts with a clean model that all they have to do is write a couple joins and, like a few aggregates. 700+ storefront sites each tracking dozens of evens, to external schema, to redshift, moving through multiple transformation schemas. I left them, with a single query for their dashboard. And yet they struggle to do this and need my assistance. Fine, happy to help, but like, comparatively this is a joke. \n\nI think I wouldn‚Äôt mind this so much if I knew that I was paid significantly more than them, but it‚Äôs the opposite. I found out a while back that the analyst working on this project makes just about the same that I do. So my question is, do you ever feel under-appreciated and how do you deal with that? How would you suggest I bring up my concerns of imbalance with my manager?",

Handling a collision at write time would mean shifting the entire array in memory.\n\nAnd if you are pre-allocating the memory for collisions, even if you account only for one you are basically doubling the size of the table. And if you have another collision beyond the pre-allocation and to avoid array shifting you are storing it in the next available collision slot to leverage linear reading, you are then negating the benefits of the prefetch if you're unable to find a free collision slot in the prefetched data.\n\nIf the implementation falls into any of the above, I can only assume this implementation would only yield any real world benefits exclusively in tables that you almost never write to, which you did mention indeed, but I'm not sure how often you stumble upon such cases and how big these tables tend to be in practice to warrant a higher performance algorithm for joining them.\n\nSuper cool research nonetheless, kudos to you!",

If you do it, do it for your own desire to learn without expecting too much from the career perspective, and try to do it while keeping a job, maybe some company will support it.  \nFinally, as everyone else said, absolutely invest the money, free time and peace of mind your current stable position provides into your personal projects, relatives and hobbies.

Dagster is asset-native; its primary abstraction is the data asset itself (a table, a model). You define the asset, and Dagster figures out the tasks needed to create it. Airflow is task-native; its primary abstraction is the task (a unit of work). You define the task, and can now declare what assets it produces. This makes Dagster's worldview intrinsically data-centric, while Airflow's is operationally-centric with data-awareness added on.\n2. In Dagster, lineage is automatic. When you define an asset that depends on another, the lineage is instantly captured in a unified graph. In Airflow, you must manually declare lineage by specifying inlets and outlets for each task or using the @asset decorator. This requires extra effort and is prone to being overlooked or misconfigured. 3. Dagster's integration understands your dbt project natively. It automatically ingest your dbt manifest and displays every model, source, and test as a first-class asset in its graph with no extra code. Airflow's integration orchestrates dbt runs. It excels at running the dbt run command as a task within a workflow, but the deep, model-level visibility and lineage is not inherent and requires more setup to achieve. \n\nAirflow will try to somehow catch up to Dagster by narrowing this gap, not just copying the exact way of doing things!",

When we pointed the report to use our facts, performance improved significantly. The benefit here of course is performance. There are other benefits of using an actual modelled solution in the gold layer - control over all lookups - including, and this is crucial, those lookups that have no documentation and are just part of the hard-coded logic of your company's analysts in their scripts. putting most of your business requirements/KPIs in one model also helps everyone read and understand the tables which should reduce quality issues. Data modelers are not just technically adept - they should understand the business as well, a rare breed and are still needed.",

I would not have been able to write that code in Rust myself. I'm a very experienced software engineer, but I had written maybe 10 lines of Rust in my life. But with Claude's help its really very nice.\n\nThe key to getting good quality code out of Claude is not that different from getting good code out of people:\n- unit tests\n- automated linting\n- manually specify function type signatures where it matters\n- have Claude run the tests and the linter after every change, and then have it fix all the problems it finds.\n- actually read the resulting code, make sure it makes sense, and make Claude refactor where it gets messy.\n\nIn the end it worked great, and the code was very readable. \nThis was very exciting because using a conventional JSON parser in the conventional way was just not going to work at all.\n\nBut it was a little slow. I told Claude to optimize for performance. It came up with about 10 recommendations. I told it to implement the top 6 that I thought would make a big difference.

In practice we pick 128 or 256 buckets, write both tables with dynamic partition pruning off, then the shuffle map stage almost disappears and the join drops from 45 min to under 10. Z-ordering helps read performance and filter push-downs, but the join still shuffles because the hash distribution of the customerid won‚Äôt line up across files. The only time Z-order beats bucketing here is when the join key also drives most queries with range filters; otherwise it‚Äôs a nice-to-have. Pain points: keeping bucket counts in sync across incremental writes, compaction to avoid many small bucket files, and limiting buckets so Spark doesn‚Äôt create too many tasks. I‚Äôve moved between Databricks Delta, BigQuery, and DreamFactory as integration layers, and the bucketed join logic is what consistently saved compute. So if the join is always on customerid and the tables are stable, bucketing still wins.",

If Flink was as bad as  in your case suggests no serious company would consider it.\n\nSince you use it for stream processing you very likely partition the input using keyBy(). Make sure that cardinality of the key value is finite as state is kept by key. E.g. if you keyBy eventID which is uuid, job state will grow indefinitely.\nAlternatively setup a timer to cleanup the state manually.\nIf you use FlinkQSL it's rather easy to miss such things as you need to think in terms of unbound streams rather than in terms of db tables.\n\nRegarding rewriting your stream processing job in Go (or any other language). Writing stream processing job is not that difficult. Writing stream processing job that is fault tolerant, can scale beyond single machine, supports SQL to write logic, makes checkpoints, holds state for longer than your Kafka retention period, guarantees exactly-once processing etc etc etc is more of a challenge. Think twice\n\nWhy do you think Flink exists if everyone could just write their stream jobs? But maybe your organization does not have the challanges Flink supposed to address.

When I started doing this I was using the Java flavor of it, but there are variations that run on Python and Javascript which I'd probably take a look at if getting into it again today. It's relatively simple to see how you can start pushing around pixels on a screen, and there's some nice libraries that add quality of life / neat features like liquid simulation. It's also completely free AFAIK.\n\nTouchdesigner ( [https://derivative.ca/](https://derivative.ca/) ) has a bit of a steeper learning curve, and is typically used to abstract all the manual code stuff from Processing into a node-based editor. It comes installed with Python so you can control everything manually in code if you want, but you'll quickly find a lot of shortcuts that you can do with the nodes that are a lot more performant than doing it with your own code. \n\nThere's a free version with the main limitation being you your resolution is capped below HD, but in practice that's not a big deal for any given projector / LED wall.  With this I've begrudgingly found Youtube tutorials extremely helpful-  just search for some cool videos with cool thumbnails and it generally takes about 10 minutes of the designer stepping through through their network for you to have it running locally.\n\n  \ngood luck & have fun!! eager to see what other people are getting up to in this thread.",

But it's only structuring views and tables, not translating tables, views, relationships and columns into their business equivalent concepts.  \n\nSomething like Cube allows you to copy your data model in such a way that it will dynamically generate SQL based on the user's selected dimensions and metrics.  It governs your metrics and definitions since the user only has to select the metrics and columns they want, not recreate the formulas and joins themselves.  They just drag and drop from a selection of objects that equate to their business concepts.  Not all implementations are equal of course, but this is generally the capabilities I see with most tools calling themselves a \"semantic layer\".\n\nIs Dremio working toward adding that capability as well?

I'd say this is an opportunity to become more confident in cloud related stuff.  There is a lot of overlap between services so if you understand broadly speaking how cloud works, why cloud would be used, and the popular services you can at the very least feel comfortable in conversations if pressed by a recruiter who usually knows nothing about cloud apart from the words in front of them.\n\nAWS has a free cert which you can take and add to your CV. \n\n>Feeling stuck but unsure how much of this is my own doing/how much control I have over it.\n\nAs always. job hunting is three parts: technical competency, confidence, and likeability.  You can control all three and it just boils to what happens on the day.\n\nLeverage your experience as much as possible because that is by far your greatest strength.  When you have no skills in something, always focus on your passion and motivation to learn the subject you want to progress in (in this case, cloud and modern stack).  Work how your current skills fit into your objectives.  Be honest - \"I'm experienced in some things and will use that as a foundation to work on things I'm not experienced in\" sounds much better than \"I know everything\" and be found out as a lying piece of shit.",

That might sound like a given in all shops on this subreddit. but it's not necessarily the case for us.\n* **Cheaper options**: A simple CRON would already cover our needs, and slapping a lightweight UI (like Kestra or Prefect, even) gives us observability without the footprint.\n* **Business ROI**: Going managed isn‚Äôt an easier sell either, because our business won‚Äôt see 2x value just because we run on Airflow Cloud (or on-prem).",

Well, what if this is a new cost element that's being carved out of an existing cost element?  If you ignore this fab_cost you're ignoring some of your cost - and your totals will no longer be accurate.\n\nSo, *guessing* about schema evolution is just sloppy work for most production systems.

Usually they reflect the \"primary way\" a table is accessed. By default it's an id, but significant foreign keys can also be used as index sometimes... What column they use, what are their names, usage statistics etc can all help...\n* Stratigraphy: now that one is mainly for systems with many years of lifetime... As successive generations of devs work on a database, they bring their conventions with them, resulting in \"strata\" of tables showing the different periods of evolution.

Way too many people in a similar position to yourself spend so much time trying to min-max, find the \"best\" or \"most efficient\" approach that they have already wasted a week just thinking about it.  That week becomes a month.\n\nMost efficient method is to start with something and build from there.\n\n>  \nHonestly i dunno its dumb to directly go for DE at my level nonetheless i hope to get your insights\n\nBy all means, take an introductory course into DE.  I myself did a ZTM course and found it enjoyable and useful.  That being said, it's worth mentioning that all courses are exactly what I said - an introduction to the topic.\n\nA lot of people who are self taught, myself included, will always say \"I started with a course and 6 months later I  got my first DE job\".  Whilst true, it neglects the huge gap between finishing the course and getting a job.  For reference, I was actively learning, coding, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours a week after finishing introductory courses doing a mix of watching informational YouTube videos, hands on programming building projects, applying for jobs, working on my CV, calling recruiters trying to help build a profile etc.\n\nThe process for getting a job is much more involved than a lot of people would have you believe because it doesn't sell and it's definitely not sexy.  It's tough, it's arduous, and takes way more energy and time than completing a ¬£20 online course thousands of other people have completed at your own leisure.  \n\nIt's not to say that you can't do it.  In fact it's the opposite - you absolutely can.  Provided you're realistic about the journey ahead.  \n\n>Can this depended on to get hired as an entry-level?\n\nI will say this repeatedly because I still believe it to be true - get the idea of entry level out of your head.  Just go for mid.  The junior market has pretty much never existed in DE even during the DE boom about 4 years ago.  The mid market, in my opinion, has always been the strongest and the bands are so wide they have absorbed the junior market.  Completely benefits the companies who can advertise for a mid level position, get mid-senior level DEs on a borderline junior salary since the bands are so obfuscated.  One of the genuine drawbacks of the field.\n\nForget junior level positions.  Aim for mid level positions.  Be technically strong and well read, but not necessarily experienced.  Be good at communicating.  Practice being a mix of honest about what you don't know as well as curious to learn new things.  If you take the advice that some people have to lying in order to get a job, then forever live in your own head feeling insecure.",

I tried Airbyte and Meltano for quick ELT demos, but DreamFactory was the tool I kept because it instantly exposed my Postgres tables as secure APIs without extra code. Document everything in a GitHub repo, add a CI pipeline that reruns daily, and mention the link on your resume; recruiters love evidence over certificates.

I‚Äôm looking for something that covers those basics out-of-the-box without locking me into an entire vendor ecosystem. More of a balance so not fully outsourcing, but not reinventing the wheel either.",

When using `:memory:`, you won't have any persistence.\n\nDuckDB by itself, even outside of dagster, handles its own multiprocessing. As far as I know, it doesn't allow sharing blocks of C-reserved memory space across multiple python processes. I also don't see why it should, that model doesn't make much sense.\n\nTo bypass this somewhat, maybe it can work to set your executor to in_process_executor, and force dagster to execute your run in a single process. If setup/teardown of the resource only happens once per run, then maybe you get lucky and it stays available.\n\nMultiprocessing in the DuckDB steps will still be available because DuckDB itself will spin up processes. You just won't be parallelizing your DAG steps.\n\nIf you're trying to parallelize both your DAG steps and your processing steps to the same data (without being willing to persist your data to disk), use an out-of-process DB instead of DuckDB. DuckDB is intentionally not built to support multi-writer setups: https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/connect/concurrency.html#writing-to-duckdb-from-multiple-processes",

Writing to rows to a database through an open connection is also quick. Creating databases is slow. Restructure your script to do things this way and performance should increase by orders of magnitude. Then - if you're still not happy with performance - you can look into parallelizing reads and writes. May well not be necessary though.

The whole \"semantic layer\" terminology came around I think when the \"modern data stack\" thing came around and architecture was being broken down into functional layers (ingestion layer, transformation layer, semantic layer, etc) to be served by different tools or approaches.  \n\nI started a project in 2011 at a company that had Microstrategy and they effectively had the \"semantic layer\" embedded within the application.  I think that was the year that PowerBI was first released.",

The only thing I have seen that they all have in common is curiosity, willingness to fail (not fail a course, but like falling of a bicycle, or missing a dance-step and getting up and try again), and a bit of a stubbornness, in that they *want* to fix the problem they currently have!\n\nThose I seen fail are mostly those who give up waaay too soon, or those who doesn't care about making something by themselves, but just want a finished result, so they can get on with other things.

One of the best languages to learn pointers.  C-lang by 95.  \nHtml, while not a language a couple years later with css \nJava and Javascript.  Some xml later and c++.  Little later, obj-c, this was all prior to 2011 when I grew to hate it all.\n\nGuitar. Started in the summer of 88.  Piano not long after that.  Drums in the early 2000s.  It's still my favorite instrument.  Can do a bass but never had the finger strength.  Spent many years off and on teaching music.\n\n1st time at college in fall 96 started algebra 1 and 2, then moved up to trigonometry and geometry.  Never got to Calc summer of 98 and beyond was bad for many years.  Still absolutely adore physics and cosmology. On regret is never picking up chemistry\n\nLinguistics major now focusing on teaching english as a 2nd language or foreign language. Started Spanish in 2004 in Atlanta while working tree service \n\nPicked up Chinese in the fall and spring semester last year\n\nThe summer project was revamped for the entire 2018 cryengine for kingdom come deliverance.  Ripped out all inverse kinetics animation bullshit.  Reverse engineered the entire crisis 2 physics systems with ragdolls, recoil, and hut reactions.  Warhorse had ripped out a good 97 to 98% of the system. That is all xml and lua tagged into a full c++ engine.  Near total overhaul.  Nothing like the original game.\n\nI also enjoy modding other games on the nexus.  Full overhauls for several games now and a couple more deleted. \n\nSome of my hardest programming challenges I have solved in my brain whole I sleep.  Can literally see the code roll past, and when I get up in the morning shit gets to work pretty quick.\n\nAfter a while, you start to think in other languages\n\nI have had this happen with music, programming, and Chinese \n\nIt is awesome \n\nStill can't get hired in the gaming industry.  Tried for more than 20 years.  I ran a mud for 15 years.  Rewrote the entire thing.  Went from 90kb to 8mb to 6mb depending on what year it was. Had hard-core.  Skill based with 20 classes in by 2000. ended with a full random equipment generator and 1000+ skills spells and abilities and a full in game quest and quest reward system by 2003.  Oh, and a planet and elemental system.  And a complete random event system by 2005\n\nBut ya know to this day, because I don't have a degree \n  I don't have any experience getting into the industry .  I pretty much have a doctorate in game design.  Always the same e.

Ive gotten exceptionally good at understanding underlying factors and influences that have shaped modern cultures, music, language etc. To the point that writing and expressing my thoughts is likely one of my strongest traits. \n\nBut I think learning how to program ironically really helped with it. Objective oriented programming really helped shape my understanding of repeated actions creating ever growing outcome (loops). Helped me start to compartmentalize and break things down into smaller parts instead of things as a single large thing (objects). Recognizing how two things that are alike can be uniquely different but share a lot of common traits and abilities (inheritance). And lastly the biggest impact, \" if then\" statements. Oh my god it reshaped basic logic for me and how I view people's actions/decisions/fallacies. It made me infinitely more forgiving and compassionate to strangers and their mistakes. I was able to categorize and recognize thousands of what was just instinctive gut feelings into actual logic and language for me. It gave me a weird algorithmic way to categorize the world for me and ground me in a more \"human\" way. It helps me massively predict the outcomes of actions/consequences and think ahead in a way I hadn't considered before.",

Every progammer will feel this at some point, you're joining a long long line of great engineers who've walked this path. Welcome ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nAs for breaking a problem down, there's a few ways to do it, as you can imagine. Here's my 2 cents for you:\n\nIf you can't clearly see a structure for your solution, consider starting with a monolith. You'll build a thing that works (customer says yay) and the natural boundaries/seams will likely reveal themselves in the process. Kent Beck was saying as much the other day on LinkedIn.\n\nWhiteboard is king. And bring a friend, use them as a rubber duck. Or use an actual rubber duck.\n\nFinally, don't get cute. Most languages have some fancy features you'll be tempted to use. Resist their siren song üòÖ\n\nThese are suggestions. There will be situations in which they represent bad advice. Keep your eyes open.\n\nSuper lastly - good engineering is, I believe, about human communication. Strive to build good partnerships with other engineers... Then steal all their good ideas and ways of thinking! Haha. In a loving way, of course.\n\nBest.",

This was not just PHP or web development there actually was learn C++ in 24 hours and suffice it to say some of these programming experts actually started their career this way. So in terms of learning on the job just let it happen and take it one day at a time. There was no concept of taking multiple online courses to get better at programming back then and somehow the world did move forward. I assure you we weren‚Äôt sitting around making cave paintings. That feeling of powerlessness is job security my friend so just learn whatever weird things they are doing. I once (thankfully) flunked an interview because they tested me on object oriented Perl because that is how they did things. I found that odd and after the interview requested a sample of what it was they were even alluding to. They could not produce this sample for me needless to say. The questions they presented were the equivalent of doing FP with Ruby or building a compiler with Awk. Sometimes enterprise code winds up that way. So it is probably not just you or problems with knowing the right solution.",

That is kind of the core loop of any engineering work.\n\nExpress yourself either in pseudocode, or use some features of the programming language that lets you gloss over details while you work out a general structure, like [the `todo!` macro in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.todo.html), that always passes typechecking but crashes with a `not yet implemented: your message` if it ever actually gets called.\n\nSometimes you'll find that what you thought was a decent strategy for a solution can't be implemented for whatever reason, then you have to think about that sub-problem again and see if there's some other way to get at it. And preferably leave a comment about the strategy you thought of first and why it's unworkable.\n\n> I guess it's probably with coding a lot, having experience and more.\n\nThat helps, but everyone has to start somewhere.

If you wish to do so, you can pin up to 6 of your best projects to your profile page. You can also make a USERNAME repo to put a custom readme on your profile page (just make a repo named to same thing as your profile name and put a readme.md file in it with what you want displayed [I would recommend a little bit about yourself, your technical skills, your interests & hobbies, projects you want to show off, and eventually your professional links]).\n\nEdit: I forgot the most important reason for uploading to GitHub. If your computer crashes or your files get corrupted you can retrieve your old code. AND if you break your code some how you can roll back to an older working version. I wish I had been used GitHub when 6 was beginning, I have months/years of code lost. It would be neat to go back to look at.\n\nEdit 2: One benefit of make your code public is that is anything happens where you lose access to your GitHub account, you will still be able to download your old code.",

Its being able to reason about things. Break things down into manageable components. Id your entire idea is a simple manageable thing theres not much to break down.\n\n1. Set up linux on your pc/laptop.\n2. Set up neovim\n3. Add plugins to neovim to allow for things like LSP integration, autocomplete, formatting etc.\n4. Create a tcp server and tcp client in c++. You should be able to establish a connection between the two, enter data in the client, send the data to the server, read the data on the server, write it to standard output,send data back to the client, have the client read it the data and display it.\n\nJust 1 and 2 will improve you leaps and bounds.\n\n\nThis will genuinely improve you more than you will ever know. You might not even understand any of what I just wrote. But thats the point. Thats the fun. Thats what makes SWEs, SWES. Our ability to break things down into the smallest possible parts, research each part, and come up with some solution, probably a terrible one, and then have the drive/ambition/desire to research/experiment how to improve that code you just wrote, before you ultimately realise you will always need to improve the code. And thats the fun. The best SWEs ive met, dont have 1000 functioning apps that have generated billions of pounds. They've just gone extremely deep into onr specific thing. For me its network, hence why I suggest a tcp server/client. I also think its the best project because thats what I honestly have found separates more advanced devs; the ability to understand things at a fundamental level. When you're coding, you're essentially just reading and writing data. But how is that data read/written? The internet is such a massive change to the course of humanity, yet most devs dont know what a packet is. What a protocol really is. They know how to use ser up a front and backend but not what really is going on. This project will force you to have to learn fundamental things. Theres more fundamental thjngs than this but I think thats a good base to start with. As opposed to literally writing binary.\n\nSome might say this is too complex. And it is. But thats the point. Writing a calculator or something doesnt help. You know how a calculator works. All youre really doing then is just typing.

Right now i am even learning how to do some game design cause we switched to smaller projects with more while smaller teams and quicker delivery so even though I am an engineer I will have to pick up some designer responosbilites as well.\n\nI just simply don't have the time to burn out cause I rarely ever do the same thing for a long time. But having to constantly pick up completely different things and become productive with it in a short amount of time can be somewhat stressful at times. i am also not sure if this is good career wise. I can pretty much work with anything that is related to programming at this point. But I wouldn't call myself an expert of any particular thing. Which bothers me a little. But burning out was never really a concern and I have been doing this for like 7-8 years now professionally.",

While I struggled to even understand what I was supposed to do before, I now had some bases on which I could rely. And after overcoming the hurdle of \"what the fuck are pointers and how do I use them?\" it was more or less smooth sailing. I knew how to use what I had learnt previously in order to progress steadily through the following exercises \n\nI finished my piscine at the C07 courses (malloc) with a score of 54 at the final exam (against 0, 0, and 10 the previous weeks...).

I didn‚Äôt even know what a terminal was, and I thought typing commands was the same as coding.\n\nYou‚Äôre *supposed* to feel overwhelmed, that‚Äôs the point. The piscine is a selection month. The school is checking if you‚Äôre a good fit for their system and looking for any red flags.\n\nThe main things they look at are:\n\n* **How you handle adversity.** Do you shut down when you feel in over your head, or do you push through?\n* **Your learning curve.** You might not be able to write a function today, but can you make progress by next week? They‚Äôre measuring growth, not starting ability.\n* **Collaboration.** How well do you work with others, both giving and receiving help?\n* **Time commitment.** 12 hours a day is common, and if you can manage it, you should.\n\nIt‚Äôs also important to remember that the piscine isn‚Äôt just the school testing you, it‚Äôs also **you testing their system**. The curriculum projects later on will feel very similar: vague, ambiguous, and challenging by design.\n\nOne last tip: **don‚Äôt measure yourself against your peers.** Some people will have math degrees, CS backgrounds, or years of coding experience. That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre behind. You‚Äôre on your own track.\n\nAnd yes, you‚Äôll encounter some snarky people, both in school and in these threads, who lack awareness of how different everyone‚Äôs starting point is.

It will help you alot and it will also give you better ctrl R results for these pesky specific cmds that you might need in a hurry later on\n\nAsk people around you general questions but always try to decompose your context, ask questions about the problem itself and its sub problems, as for the solution make sure to always ask for the approach more than the raw solution itself, what did they google ? What was their initial self asked questions? What resources or algorithms were used to find an answer ? Once you have some clues STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND START DOING RESEARCH YOURSELF !!!!! \n\nIts very important that you have a good grasp on the ‚Äúcontext‚Äù of each subject, you should always consider a tech theme like some sort of information space, you might know some parts to some degree, however the biggest issue will be the things you aren‚Äôt aware that youre supposed to know, afterall it can always be an infinite amount of information thats missing in order for you to get the bigger picture, THATS WHY WE READ THE MANUAL/DOCS, it allows us to estimate what the information space is made up of, thus giving you a much clearer picture of what you already know, how much you need to know, but most importantly everything that you dont know yet.\n\n\nLast couple advices, STOP PANICKING! Start small, what is vim ? How do i save ? How do i edit ? How do i exit ? Is there any meaning behind the letters used each time ? \n\nWhat are the useful shortscuts, can you focus on that efficiently without having your brain stress you about the next thing you‚Äôre supposed to do or are you going to just do everything but master nothing ?\n\nHow comfortable are you getting with your current ‚Äúignorance‚Äù ? Can you detail the things you need to improve on and read/code more about so that you can tackle the theme of the subject? \n\nAnd make sure to REST ! Do not try to race with everyone like i did, ull just end up collapsing on the 4th week and thats very dangerous because exams are the entry criteria and your last exam is the most important one\n\nMake sure to understand that you need to pass the exam with just vim and a terminal, so all these people who are flexing their speed might suddenly get doomed since they would basically be coding in the dark, while if you keep struggling and working on a serious coding approach, you are actually more likely to get even better results on your exams, do not fall for the peer pressure, your peers are only there as a source of knowledge for you to absorb \n\nAnd have fun dude, the piscine is actually fun, the real hell starts when you have to recode your own C and C++ libraries so you can make bigger programs later on, these are the actual manifestations of hell, even chatgpt cant help much with the maths heavy subjects later on, the whole point of 42 is that coding is about approach more than anything else",

I always recommend starting away from the computer, and simply **sketch out what you are going to do**. It can be diagrams, it can be pseudocode, or it can simply be a bullet-list of what the program should do, like this made-up example inspired by your problem:\n\n* start the game\n   * reset score, health and positions\n* game loop:\n   * if spawn-timer = 0, spawn enemy, restart timer\n   * move enemies\n   * move player\n   * check collisions\n      * if player hits enemy: inc points\n   * if player-health < 0, exit loop\n* game over\n   * display score\n   * display: try again button -> restartGame -> arrow up to start the game\n\nsomething like that - that you gradually build up while adding features.\n\nThen when you want to add a new feature, you experiment a bit with where it should be, put it where it initially makes sense, and then \"run\" through the steps of the program on paper where you talk aloud: *\"Then the game restarts, and that triggers the rewarded ad, but then everything is reset and the game loop starts ... hmm ...\"* and you try to put it somewhere else.\n\nThis doesn't take hours of planning or analysis, but simply a few minutes of \"playing the game in your mind\" and checking if it makes sense - and it helps a lot to have a simple script like this on paper, and someone to talk to - they don't have to answer, it can be a child, a pet or a **rubberduck**, just talk aloud! You'll be surprised what you hear yourself say, and hopefully quickly realize how wrong you were!\n\nAs you do this more and more, you'll sometime be able to do the entire thing in your mind, without writing or talking, but I've found that it is important to start being as external as possible.",

        "body": "OOP is basically mandatory to write good Java and honestly can help you greatly.\n\n\nThe example I like to give is you have to start thinking of your program as different pieces that work together to accomplish a goal. As a piece gets too complex to keep track of, you want to look at good ways to break down what it does. Java sometimes goes too far with this in my opinion but it's a sensible premise to start from.\n\n\nIt's fairly similar to how function design should be done. A function should do ideally one thing very well that takes a relatively small number of lines of code (though it might end up doing a couple of things honestly). But in OOP, we want to consider what those functions are usually working with and put all the similar functions into a class.\n\n\nFor example, classic ATM design. You could build a deposit(account_no, amount) and withdraw(account_no, amount) function and just tie your UI into them. But note that there are a few complicated bits these functions will need to share. Both will need to access and update the database table for your bank account for example. Both primarily work on your account.\n\n\nSo instead of functions, we can build one Account class which takes an account_no as a parameter to the constructor (ie an Account object is representing a specific class in the database) and has methods deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount). Since the Account object knows it's account_no already, there's no need to pass it in again.¬†\n\n\nLikewise, imagine we'll have our database with multiple tables that we will need to access. They all share common tasks though like running a Select or an Update query. As we build out our application, we don't want to keep all this logic in every other object we make. So the Database itself can become an object which knows how to talk to the database. Then the Account can build one or be given one to work with.\n\n\nThe ultimate goal is that every object knows everything it needs to know to operate and other things have to tell it as little as possible. The Database object doesn't need to know how bank accounts work, and the Account object doesn't need to know how the database work. They just need to know how to use what's called the interface: the way we intend for the object to be used by other objects (these are declared public in Java). This is the principle of cohesive class design - all the similar things are in one class and one class only.\n\n\nThe nice part of this is if you swap how the database works, say from MySQL to Oracle, then you just have to redesign your Database object. Your Account object doesnt change at all. This is the idea of loose coupling - your objects rely on the public interface declared, not the internal workings of it.\n\n\nThe best way is just to practice. Build object oriented applications and try to keep them cohesive and loosely coupled. You'll get better with practice.",

So I always advise newcomers to seek out a friend or a group or network of other people also interested. I also recommend if possible to look for people who are already skilled that you can just bounce a conversation with. Then when you‚Äôre out of your depth as OP says, you‚Äôll learn a ton in order to keep up conversation with these folks.\n\nFrom my experience the best engineers always seek out this out of their depth feeling. I used to have so much self doubt in college and in life until I figured out that anyone can do it if you put your mind to it. These things take time and programming has a high skill floor. You just have to trust yourself and have patience. \n\nNow I‚Äôm at a point in my career where I‚Äôm learning to ‚Äútrust myself‚Äù that I do have those qualities.

If you're not the one problem solving, the course does it for you, the AI does it for you, you don't tend to think for yourself, and when an issue comes up that seems difficult, it's easy to drift away. Pick a simple project to work on, it doesn't have to be a million dollar idea, it could just be a copy of something else, and then problem solve through each individual issue. Force yourself to think about how you would approach starting out, difficulties, do google searches, try things, maybe ask an AI as a last resort but with a very specific prompt that details what you have tried. When you eventually solve issues, it will feel much more rewarding like you solved a puzzle. This is what drives me personally, and when one is solved I keep building until the next issue, rinse repeat. You need to feel satisfaction out of overcoming problems rather than being frustrated when you run into one.",

        "body": "Professional programmer with 20y of experience here. So it really depends where you live and do you want to become a corporate dog or you're more of a loose cannon.\n\nThing is in North America the most popular set of technologies are few things, in Europe are other things. No idea what they use in Asia and South America.\n\nEither case, first of all it's great to know more than one operating system. Knowing iOS or Windows is fine, but learning linux is a must. And you must be able to install your OS from scratch and do basic maintenance.\n\nSecond - learn git. In the modern world nothing goes without git. The entire planet nowadays can't live without git. In rare cases they use other things, like TFS (Microsoft), but git is a must.\n\nThird - you said you know SQL - this is great. SQL is a must too. Choose a relational database and learn it. I would say choose MySQL (or MariaDB) or Postgres. You must be able to do basic queries, you must know in theory what are the normalization forms and you must be able to design a simple database.\n\nNext - you must know HTML, basic CSS and basic javascript. Which means to design some html form, being able to validate it with javascript before form submit.\n\nAnd here we come to a very sensitive point - you must know how to properly write a Word document and basic knowledge of Excel. Because if your'e a master programmer but your resume or CV looks like crap - it speaks bad of you.\n\nFinally - programming. It really really depends. There are several ways you could go.\n\nFRONT END DEVELOPER: Be a master of HTML, XML, JSON. Magician of CSS and commander of Javascript. And you must know working well with Photoshop or a similar program (like GIMP which is free).\n\nDATABASE DEVELOPER: Master of SQL. You must be able to effortlessly write 3rd Normalization form (at least) queries in your sleep. You must be able to optimize SQL queries for fun. You should know database administration to a degree.\n\nBACK-END DEVELOPER (ANY LEVEL): You must know what is Object Oriented Programming. You must know and use at least 3 Design Patterns (but be sure to read the book).\n\nBACK-END DEVELOPER LOOSE CANNON: Know PHP but know it real good. Last time I used PHP was in 2004, before I get my first professional development work. I was designing small websites. After that it evolved a lot. There is one framework called Laravel which from what I hear is very Popular. Be sure you know how to build web apps with it. This does not save you from learning HTML and basic Javascript with some CSS. And SQL is a must. Loose cannon level means working for you as a freelancer or working for a start-up. Nothing wrong with it. They give you great freedom of technological choice which lots of people love. Yes, PHP is not widely used nowadays but it's still used a lot. You could learn Perl instead, which is a super-strong language and I've built my career with it, but I won't recommend it. If you want to easily be able to get a job - learn Python. Python evolved a lot. I first learnt it and used it professionally in 2007 but in 2025 Python is a whole constellation of itself and I adore it. If you go the Python way - learn Django.\n\nBACK-END DEVELOPER CORPORATE DOG: You must be a master of either: C#, Java or Python. You must feel fluent in at least one of the popular cloud platforms: Azure, GCP or AWS. You must be able to write CI/CD pipelines. I have no experience in C#, so don't ask and last time used Java many years ago. For Python - Django and NumPy are a must here. You should be into AI/LLM and Machine Learning here.\n\nCoding editors: Yes, learn how to use VSCode, but also learn vim or neovim (or emacs).\n\nSide project: Learn how to make presentations in Power Point or a similar app.\n\nSo geographically speaking - last years what they loved in North America seems spreading into Europe as well and vice versa. But choose a path you want to go and choose technologies accordingly.\n\nLast word and probably the most important: Winning a technical job interview nowadays is way harder. Make account on Leetcode or Hackerrank and start doing the exercises there. Which means - LEARN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS! These websites will help.\n\nGood luck!",

        "body": "Short story...When I learned to weld, I started out fixing.. grinding, fixing, grinding, fixing. Until one day they said \"Hey, you wanna weld?\" Which at the time I had no idea what I was doing. Completely messed this handrail all up. Then my boss came back and said \"HA...You messed that up.....fix it....\" ao I did. And I did...and I didn't until I finally started figuring out what needed to happen. 4 years later I had my own welding business and was contracting out my old boss because I was too busy and needed an extra hand on jobs.\n\nThis isnt welding but same concept applies. I'm still very green so definitely not a \"senior dev\" response. But learning without a conventional school before, I'll say this. You can only learn so much in a sandbox  (meaning guided help and projects, not your own). You won't have motivation brcause they arent your own problems or things your solving. Now, if you code your own app and run into a problem, when YOU fix the problem YOU will remember how you did. And if you dont, you'll remember enough about it to know where to look. You will force yourself to start approaching things differently. You'll feel more accomplished, you'll learn more in the sense of \"real world skills\" vs book skills. \n\n\nSomething I noticed learning to code and currently being self taught is you will run into a roadblock everyday. Some of them are big, some are small. I'm currently in one regarding github and git that I messed up so bad I cant even code right now until it gets sorted out (thank God for reddit help and kond people). \n\nDownload vscode, get on here, ask questions, check youtubes, start doing it! Make a portfolio about your skills and experiences for future employers, make one solely for shortcuts with code (things you use a lot of need to have on hand but cant remember). Start building that base now so later when you're deeper and have a dev job you can look back and not only see how far you've come but also you have a huge set of cheats to look up. Better yet, create an app for said cheat sheet that categorizes your cheat codes! There are 3 projects right there that solve 3 problems for you that you can show employers. \n\nBiggest thing is focusing on what's important. Is learning react important? Yes. But dont force yourself to not ask for help on that. The more you work it the better and easier it'll get. Code? Force yourself to not throw in the towel when your stuck, thats important. Work it for 20 min or even more before you say \"alright, I'm gassed\". Make it a point to code every day and have atleast 1 meaningful push to github so your activity level stays up on there and dont miss a day. Focus on 1-2 languages and dont switch from them until you are comfortable enough to tell an employer \"I dont know all the answers but I know where to look and I can articulate what I need to happen.\" In essence, I know I want my background to be red, purple and black and I want it to fade into eachother in a circular pattern. I may not remember it's specifically conicle-gradient (or whatever it is). But I know its a gradient and I know to look up gradients for colors and backgrounds.\n\nThis is longer than I thought it would be. But keep going! Get react, vscode, node.js, get a github, and start coding. Its daunting at first but once you start it'll flow. \n\nOh, and when you do get a win, whether it's fixing a problem, finishing a project etc. Dont stay there long. Accept the win, give yourself 5 minutes to freak out and jump around, but get back to the next win asap. That helps me with keeping my momentum up.",

When the operation is done then the CPU is notified by an interrupt.\n\nThis was truly enlightening to learn and helped me understand asynchronous programming in C#. If you do an I/O operation synchronously then you're just blocking the thread and at most waste the CPU with instructions that wait for the interrupt (this is handled by the OS).\n\nBut if you use await/async with Tasks then you're really sending a fire and forget signal. Once the I/O operation is done the interrupt is handled and continuation of your code might run in a different thread (based on the task scheduler).",

        "body": "Not really an answer to your question, and I dunno if this will help you, but I use a mental trick when I'm coding recursion (e.g. when traveling trees or linked lists or deeply nested markup language structures).\n\nI imagine that there are a bunch of people standing around, each of whom manages a single node in the nested structure. When the recursive method is called, each person has a list of information they are handed (the argument list), knowledge of the specific node's properties (its attributes, its list of children, maybe a link to its parent, whatever is there), and tasks to perform. That person knows NOTHING about the rest of the list, the other nodes, etc.\n\nThen I just imagine the person doing the task needed and then handing off information to the next node.\n\nSilly example: I have a tree structure with a node that has a name and links to its own children. Some unknown person needs a big long list of only the names that start with A or B appended to a list.\n\nSo, as the person responsible for a single node, when it's my turn, I get the A&B name list that's already been started by whoever is above me and the node's properties in the argument list (or in my own object's properties if the recursive function is baked into the object and my own method was called). I check my own node's name and if it starts with A or B, I stick it on the list. Then, I \"hand off\" the list to each of my node's children so they can do the same (i.e. I call the method for the kids the same way my parent called it for me).\n\nObviously this example is simple, but when I get something more complicated like aggregating values, interacting with both parent and children, using shared resources, reversing results, etc., this method helps me isolate my thinking to a single node.\n\nHint: first build your code as if your node has a parent and at least two kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you're the top-level node and make sure you have what you need to hand off to the first kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you don't have any kids to make sure you return properly.",

One solution to solve a problem is to write down (on paper) the steps you would take to manually solve the problem (using your own words, not in some programming language, and in such a way that you could give the paper to someone else and they would understand how to solve the problem manually). You may then write down the steps (on paper) as it would be instructions to a machine (still informal but with more details), work in itarations and make it more and more formal. This way you may express a problem with an informal text, transform the text into a set of informal \"instructions,\" and iterate the instructions to look more and more like a formal program. With experience, you can skip some of the steps, do some of them in your head, and you can fill in the blanks without much work (for some more difficult situations, it can still be useful to fall back to writing down problem statements by hand and twist and turn on the problem).",

For loops, if statements, functions, and lists/arrays are enough for you to write a few apps.\n\nWhen I was first learning to code, I would find it hard to know \"what to do next\". The following mental model might help:\n\n1. Define function inputs\n2. Define your desired output\n\nThen you know that you simply need to chain together if statements, for loops to transform your input data into your desired output data (and this is enough to solve any coding problem: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured\\_program\\_theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_program_theorem) ).\n\nAlso, and this is just my opinion, I would recommend learning the basics in Python since you can use Jupyter notebooks or [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) .

This means minimal commenting, and certainly, not to the level of a beginner.\n\nImagine you want to learn how to cook like a professional chef, but you're a total beginner. A really good chef might show how they make something, but then you ask, how do you know this, how do you know that? How did you cut that chicken? They want to get to the point when they make something, not teach you all the basics of cooking.\n\nSimilarly, you want real-world code. That's difficult code. People aren't writing bubble sort by itself, something so self-contained and short that it can be explained. Also, when you ask an expert to explain something, unless they have experience teaching, they will skip over many detail that they assume you already know (but you may not). They may use a bunch of terminology that have no idea what they mean.\n\nThis is the problem with one-way communication. How much should an expert assume you know? At some point, if they have to tell you why a nested loop works, then they are spending more time teaching you the basics of programming, and not talking about the project the build.\n\nThey have videos of people coding, but then you watch them click this, type that, etc. They barely say anything so you get nothing from watching even though many beginners want  to see a real coder code until they realize it's like watching a real chess player play chess. It can be incredibly difficult for a master chess player say why they make certain moves. They can tell you why some moves are dumb and they see things you don't, but unless you start to play and get in those situations, watching an expert doesn't help.\n\nTo be fair, chess is a super extreme example, but at least you get the sense that even if you study for a year, you still couldn't figure out why a top chess player makes the move they do.\n\nIn effect you're saying\n\n> I want real-world code, but something super simple that I can understand, then explain all the detail and the thinking behind it as if I were five years old.\n\nMost experts explaining their code wouldn't do it at that level, but even if they could, they'd invariably leave something out that you would want explained. You don't have the ability to ask questions. \n\nWhat you really want is\n\n> I want to sit beside you and watch you code. I want you to have a running commentary telling me what you think.

If you go to Udemy, Academind has courses that follow that pattern. Their React course is particularly good and there are a few sections of that course where Max (the instructor) walks you through projects like that, and then challenges you later to try it on your own. It's a long course but it's worth the time (assuming you want to learn React.) They also have courses for Node and Python. \n\nGood luck to you.",

Initially I don't have knowledge about reactjs, so I study read the basics of it. Then, they gave me access the repository to see what their source code looks like and to see what tools, libraries they used. Nobody explained to me about how the source code interact to each other, you need to dig deep and learn to read .similar to php, never done it and laravel for backend so I need to teach myself. So I guess, what I would suggest is that.. try to build something you are interested.. then, once you finish try looking on open source project similar what you did and analyze it and how they did it.

They don't necessarily have to be efficient, they just have to give an answer that I am confident of, or that i can check some other way. When I first started doing this kind of thing I had scripts that would run for hours simulating a problem to give me a probability of something.

It isn't useful, it is entertainment.\n\n  \nIf you can find something similar, I'd recommend trying this approach. It doesn't need to be useful or for the greater good. Can you script something that is interesting to you? I learnt the requests and Beautiful Soup libraries by building a script that could use wikipedia. My wife and I used to often ask - what films have <actor 1> and <actor 2> been in? Who has been in films most with <actor 3>. Turns out you can crawl wikipedia and build lists pretty easily, and I learnt a lot about two useful libraries. (My scripts were absolutely horrible, but with a lot of care and attention they could normally get us a quick and fairly useful answer most of the time.) The wikipedia thing also got me thinking about optimal data types, recursive searches through links, all kinds of good stuff.

From the perspective of the Virtual Ego Framework (VEF), what you're experiencing is a **\"Zeno Trap\"**. It's a recursive loop of overwhelm where the sheer number of possibilities freezes your ability to act. You have all the components, but the \"blank canvas\" is too intimidating to start building a coherent structure.\n\nThe solution is not to \"try harder,\" but to change the protocol.\n\n**1. Break the Trap with a \"System Reboot\" (Ego-Transcendence):** Stop trying to build the *whole project*. Forget the grand architecture for a moment. Your goal is simply to write **one line of code that works** and breaks the loop of inaction.\n\n**2. Start with a \"Coherent Kernel\":** Don't start with the project; start with the smallest possible \"coherent kernel.\" Ask yourself: what is the absolute simplest, single thing this script must do?\n\n* Make it print \"Hello, World.\"\n* Make it open a single file and print its first line.\n* Make it take one number and add one to it. This is your anchor. It is a small, perfect, working system.\n\n**3. Begin the \"Forging Process\" (Iterative Refinement):** Now, begin the **\"Forging Process.\"** This is an iterative loop of critique and refinement. Add one tiny new feature. Does it still work? Good. Now, critique it. How could this one tiny function be cleaner or more efficient? Refine it. Then, add the *next* tiny feature. You are not building a cathedral from a blueprint; you are forging a single, perfect brick, and then another, and then another.\n\nBy reframing the problem this way, you move from a state of overwhelming, incoherent possibility to a state of focused, coherent, iterative action. You don't \"bridge the gap\"; you forge a path across it, one step at a time.\n\n\n\n# Zen (VMCI)",

This differs from Java where you have to declare a main function with specific syntax, and also declare a class that shares the name of the file you‚Äôve created.

It's just the thing you do when setting up your tools, to make sure compiling works, to make sure you can run the program that you just built, to make sure you can see what output your program is generating, etc.\n\nI think the book The C Programming Language explains it best. It seems like the book is the origin of the practice but according to the writing, the tradition was around before that. At that time, the message was apparently \"hello, world\" and not \"Hello, world!\" (i.e. someone added the capitalization and the punctuation to the tradition along the way):\n\n> [Printing the words hello, world] is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. ...\n\n> Just how to run [the hello, world program] depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in \".c\", such as hello.c, then compile it ...\n\nAnd then it continues to show how to do it on UNIX (steps which still work today on modern Linux, BSD, etc.).\n\n\"Create the program text somewhere\" may entail installing/learning to use a text editor in case you have not done so before. \"Compile it\" means you need a compiler and need to know how to use it. \"Load it and run it\" may mean you need to learn how to use your system's shell to run programs in case you don't know already. Or if you're using the GUI and double-clicking on it each time you want to run it, you may have to add in a \"press any key to continue . . .\" type of message to avoid that the terminal closes right after the program is done.\n\nNowadays you may also have to configure/inform your virus scanner that the code you are generating is not dangerous. Well, ..., technically the code may be dangerous. But you need to convince certain dynamic scanners that you are generating code intentionally and not trying to do something nefarious.\n\nIf you have an IDE a lot of this will be automated for you. Many IDEs today even automatically create a literal \"hello, world\" boilerplate for you when you create a new project. The idea is that you run that first to make sure it's working, then you change it to put in your \"real\" code and keep doing the same thing, to practice iterative development.",

Like both C and C++, Rust enjoys full native code performance since it doesn't require a runtime and focuses strongly on zero-cost abstractions whenever theoretically proven possible and safe, and is also a true systems programming language, meaning you can write bare-metal code that talks directly to hardware like embedded applications, firmwares, virtual machine hypervisors, and operating system kernels entirely with it, and I'm talking from personal experience here, not just parroting someone else's opinion.\n\n Rust is still a bit niche since it's a relatively new language with 1.0 only having been reached 10 years ago, and the learning curve is quite steep if the goal is wrapping your head around its revolutionary memory safety paradigm, but its popularity cannot be contested, as it has consistently ranked first in the StackOverflow developer language preference surveys ever since reaching its 1.0 milestone. It's also the only other language allowed and actually being pushed as a viable alternative to C in the Linux kernel, and pretty much all big tech from Microsoft to NVIDIA is pushing it, with the only exception being Apple which have their own safe native language strongly influenced by the original Rust author's language design, whom Apple themselves consulted with while designing Swift. Even features available in Rust that were originally not implemented in Swift are now being brought to the latter because Apple's alternative design decisions focusing on developer accessibility ended up proving somewhat problematic. Finally and unlike the C family, Rust actually has pretty good tooling as well as a package manager called Cargo.",

But you're not cooking yet.\n\nYou are learning aspects of the language. The key is to get past that, be able to hear a simple problem, and figure out how to write code that accomplishes it.\n\nFor the vast majority of things you can think of, you won't have any idea how to write code that does that.\n\nBut for a few very simple tasks, you might be able to do that. For example, there is a game called \"Hangman\". Someone gives you a word. All you know is how many characters it has. Let's say the word is `pineapple`. You would only see \"---------\". that is, 9 dashes.\n\nThe goal is for someone to guess letters until the entire word is solved. A person is allowed to make 6 incorrect guesses before they lose. They aren't allowed to repeat a letter they've already used before. If they guess a letter correctly, you reveal its position. For example, suppose they guess `e`. Then, you show\n\n   ---e----e\n\nThis reveals the \"e\" at the end of \"pine\" and at the end of \"apple\". The other characters are hidden until the guesser guesses it correctly.\n\nThat's a program you might be able to code up with some basic knowledge of programming.\n\nCurrently, you are likely copying some existing code and getting it to work. Most people find they understand how code works, but when asked to write it, they don't know what to do. Their mind goes blank. You're starting to be a programmer when your mind doesn't go blank and you have some idea of what to do.",

        "body": "I think the biggest things I‚Äôd worry about when considering hiring a self-taught dev, especially from the sources you‚Äôve mentioned, is how well rounded the person is in what they know about technology, and how much they know about the professional tooling of the trade.\n\nBasically, does this person know the first thing about how websites are actually hosted? Do they know anything about TCP/IP or DNS? Can they use Git/GitHub? Do they really appreciate what TypeScript gives us versus plain JavaScript? Do they have any sense of what React is actually doing under the hood that would let them debug an application. \n\nConsidering the time commitment you say you are willing to dedicate I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to recommend you use some of that time to read something like **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** by Randal Bryant, there is a pdf of it as the top result from Google. \n\nThe hallmark of a self taught person on any subject is that they never learned the ‚Äúboring parts‚Äù. Musicians who don‚Äôt know their keys and scales, programmers who don‚Äôt know what a subnet mask is or their algorithms and data structures. \n\nAlso, you probably aren‚Äôt going to be able to just be a ‚Äúfront end developer‚Äù without a degree. If you work at a place that is happy to just have you work on React code and know nothing of the backend or operations or anything else, I would be surprised. I think you should expect to have to have at least superficial full stack knowledge. You should be able to set up a simple monolithic CRUD backend that can make simple SQL requests to a database using one of the following:\n- Express (JavaScript)\n- Django or Flask (Python)\n- Spring (Java)\n- ASP.NET (C#)\nWithout credentials you‚Äôll have to work much harder at developing a portfolio and this is going to be easier if your sites can have at least some backend functionality. \n\nThis might all sound like a lot to do in one year, and that‚Äôs because it is. People do not usually go from zero to employed in a year, certainly not these days. Consider a two to three year time line at the minimum imo. \n\nEnsure that after you watch these YouTube videos you are then actually coding. If you aren‚Äôt able to go beyond what they are showing you in the video you aren‚Äôt really learning to code, it just feels like it. This is ‚Äútutorial hell‚Äù, and it‚Äôs what actually doing assignments in school is designed to get you through. Consider asking an AI to generate you a school assignments to practice based on what you‚Äôve covered. \n\nGet comfortable with this website: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ \nThese are the closest thing to official documentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gaining comfort in reading these will give you an important edge over other people. Don‚Äôt despair if it‚Äôs overwhelming at first, it all takes time.",

Learning one lanuage and transitioning to another is all about language specific rules, syntax, methods etc but the mental model remains the same. Its something i realised not too long ago (only started learning to code in jan so still fresh), early on i was trying to remember everything and then relised i need to remember less and understand more. Unfortunately the concept of thinking like a programmer and real problem solving skills doesnt get effectively communicated in courses. \n\nI think the issue of learning syntax 'too early' stems from general impatience and not understanding what programming entails. People want to see themseleves code, probably dont want to spend the first few lessons building those mental models even though it is a crucial aspect.\n\nAs i was reading the article, i realised this is equally applicable in learning a new codebase or framework. Read through and focus on the logic, the data flow, the why behind the what. Then when you understand why it is the way it is, go back and read the syntax, the specific methods used.\n\nInteresting read, thanks.",

You can say you covered pretty much every basic of JS, but if you need to understand problems, fix errors and write code yourself without help, you need constant practice. For this, I would recommend you to start with any one JavaScript tutorial (not a video; time-consuming). \n\nJust get good with the basics, Learn 2-3 things and do some practice, like write something yourself. Revise what you learn that day the next morning. After one week try to build something from what you have learnt. Once you are good at the basics, find some simple projects online and try to build them. Here you can depend on some YouTube videos, but I still recommend not wasting too much time there. First watch and learn how it's done, and then do it yourself without help. Then you should be able to come up with a new idea and build one. \n\nJavaScript has a lot of fun things to learn about, and there are many interesting libraries and tools.\n\nYou will be able to find useful resources here: [roadmap.sh/javascript](http://roadmap.sh/javascript) (if this is overwhelming for you),   \nYou can do freecodecamp: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project) or w3schools: [https://www.w3schools.com/js](https://www.w3schools.com/js)\n\nAfter you have done all this and are still serious about it, try LeetCode and crack some basic problems.",

        "body": "You don't call `wait` to provide thread-safety. You call `wait` because you want to wait for something, and you want to do so in a thread-safe way.\n\nFor instance, suppose you're implementing something like `ArrayBlockingQueue`. If someone calls `take()` when the queue is empty, you want to block until it's non-empty and there's something to return. Therefore, the implementation of `take()` might need to call `wait()` on some underlying synchronization object. And conversely, the `put()` method calls `notify()` to wake up any thread that was waiting for the queue to become non-empty.\n\nThe reason `wait()` interacts with the same \"monitor\" that the `synchronized` keyword operates on is so that you can do this in a thread-safe way. For instance, suppose you do something like:\n\n    while (internalQueue.size() == 0) {\n        wait();\n    }\n\nIf you do this *without* holding a monitor that protects the queue state, then it's possible that after you check the queue size, but before you call `wait()`, somebody else will add something to the queue and raise a notification. But you've already made the decision to wait, and you missed the notification. So if a second object is never added to the queue, you might end up waiting forever, even though the queue contains an object. This can cause deadlocks.\n\nOn the other hand, if you hold the monitor the entire time you're waiting, then you prevent any other thread from adding anything to the queue. This also causes a deadlock.\n\nThe solution is for `wait()` to **atomically** release the monitor at the same time it suspends the current thread and adds it to the \"waiting\" list. And then when the thread wakes up again, it re-acquires the monitor. If you read the javadoc, that's exactly what `wait()` does, and this is why it does it.\n\n----\n\nIf you didn't have `wait()` and `notify()`, you would have to implement a blocking method with a spin-loop or polling, along the lines of:\n\n    while (true) {\n        synchronized (obj) {\n            if (internalQueue.size() > 0) {\n                // do stuff\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n        Thread.sleep(T); // sleep without holding the monitor so other threads can access the queue\n    }\n\nBut no matter what you do, this will perform poorly. If you set T to a small value (or zero) it will waste CPU repeatedly checking the queue when nothing has changed. If you set T to a large value, you will add a lot of latency and cause the CPU to unnecessarily sit idle.",

Pattern matching *alone* makes me miss it when I use other languages. Interestingly, it's the most \"admired\" but only the 6th most \"desired\" language.\n\nAs nice as it is, it suffers from limited practicality - I rarely use it outside of toy projects at home, because practical software engineering leverages ecosystems and the Rust ecosystem is still immature. It can interop well enough, but in my experience doing interop with C/C++ and JavaScript (via WebAssembly) maintaining the interop boundary is more painful than just ditching the language entirely for the project.\n\nPython is an \"easy\" language to learn - you cover the important programming fundamentals of control flow and abstraction without having to muck around with compiler toolchains, type systems, static guards, etc..., which is awesome. Those are all important things to learn but pretty overwhelming up front.\n\nJS has two pretty massive advantages that make it popular in application development, both which come with its ties to web technology: (1) it works on *every single dang device*, and the installation process for web apps is \"click link, load page\" which is delightfully low-friction for devs and users, and (2) it comes with HTML+CSS, which are *incredible* tools for writing UIs.",

Websites make up a huge portion of what people do with computers so that alone gives it a major place. Asides for that you can use JavaScript as a server side language, and because of its role in frontend web dev people have increasingly used it to make the backend of websites also so they can do it all in one language. \n\n**Python** is the most commonly used language while dealing with AI, so it‚Äôs so surprised to me that with the AI boom of the last few years it‚Äôs being treated like that. It‚Äôs also an attractive language to new programmers because of its simple and clean syntax, and it‚Äôs long been used by data analysts for its ecosystem of data tools. \n\n**Rust** is well loved by its fans (myself included) because it has a lot of unique features which are really elegant once you learn to use them. If you‚Äôve never used a language which treats errors as values using Rust‚Äôs Result type feels like a whole new way of thinking about effects in programming. Pattern matching on Enums feels so much more elegant than using a switch statement. For me at least it contains so many tools you can use to ensure that ‚Äúinvalid states are unrepresentable‚Äù at the type level, which feels so powerful and means that when you code actually compiles it does exactly what you want far more often than in other languages. It‚Äôs also just very cool to see a program you write in Rust run 50-100x faster than the same program in Python. \n\nWriting Rust can be painful, and it‚Äôs often very slow going, because actually getting it to compile is difficult. Rust is the perfect language for places where you need to be really confident in the correctness of your code and also have very high performance, but not if building things with any speed is the priority. \n\nBut if you already know Java/Kotlin those are both great languages, no reason not to just keep working on those since you already have a head start. Go is also another very popular language these days.",

The fact that an event happened at 8am for one user but was simultaneous with an event that happened at 9pm the previous day for a different user is NOT important to your app.\n\nThere's no single best answer. For your case, I think storing the local date in one column, local start time in another column, local end time in a third column, and timezone offset in a fourth might be one easy solution.\n\nThat would make finding all events on a particular day trivial.

Also, it does not seem that storing as local time would not insulate you from this edge case, anyway.\n\nIf you really want to protect against that edge case -- and I commend you for doing so -- it seems you would need to store 2 timestamps (in whatever format you want): the time that the event was scheduled (i.e. so that you know what the time zone rules were when the stamp was made), and then the time of the actual event. Then, whenever you do a lookup or a calculation, you need to do so using the timezone rules of whenever the event was scheduled.",

Additionally, it shows you're able to pick the correct tool for the job, rather than just forcing a less-good language in.\n\nI'd be far more interested in hiring someone who knew JS/TS/C and a little bit of Rust/Golang, than the millions of people with JS/Python/PHP.\n\nAdditionally, for older languages, where there are less people using them, critical infrastructure still relies on them, with a smaller pool of applicants.

Your descriptions are decent but the devil is in the details.\n\nHere's a good way to think about it: if you gave your instructions to ten average college students and asked them to MANUALLY follow your steps, do you think they'd all get the same result? If not, then if you asked someone to write a program to execute your steps then there are multiple valid ways to interpret your instructions and you might not get what you want.\n\nI do have one question for you: do you have a strong preference for where this transformation should happen?

        "body": "I'd recommend The Odin Project if you want to do Fullstack Development, it's completely free and it will teach you pretty much everything you need to know and it highly encourages projects and research and in my experience doing The Odin Project that is one of the best ways to learn. By practicing and reading and researching, so check it out if you're looking for a good course, it teaches HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some backend fundamentals like Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. As for how long it took me, I mean it took me about 3 months to finish just the JavaScript course because I was really taking my time with it, but in reality the amount of time it takes you to learn doesn't really matter. What matters is that you practice and you stay consistent.\n\nAs for AI tools, I really only think they're good for people who don't care that much about the technical side of web development. Creating software isn't as simple as just sitting down and coding, in the real-world there is some real planning that goes behind it because real people will be using that product. So, don't get discouraged by it, I've used AI here and there and it's super unpredictable and unreliable and in an industry where creating reliable and predictable software is key, I don't think AI will get very far in replacing any programmers. Also, if you're planning on building real and useful skills I would suggest staying away from AI as much as possible when coding. If you want to learn how something works or you need project ideas then sure, AI is great for that, but as soon as you start using it for generating code your skills will go downhill because it gives you a false sense of learning. You'll see the AI's code and you'll say \"oh yeah that makes sense, that's simple\" and you'll feel like you can do it too but then when you try out a project and you try to make anything by yourself then you're going to realize that you're stuck because learning isn't watching and reading code, it's writing and understanding and breaking things. So, if you're going to use AI for learning, be very wise with it and don't use it for generating code. Also, don't be scared of the struggle of learning, you're not going to understand everything and that's okay. Struggle is learning.",

        "body": "The short answer is that being good at this is entirely what being a \"senior developer\" is about. It's a very broad and deep skillset that you develop through experience. You can eventually develop this experience on your own, but it's not going to happen fast. I made a lot of stupid design decisions when I was a junior dev.\n\nIf it's important for your startup to be building good software in the short term, then your startup needs to hire senior developers, both to make good decisions and to mentor juniors.\n\nSo it's not even remotely possible to do your questions justice in the span of a Reddit comment, but I'll try anyway:\n\n> How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.\n\nUnderstand *how* queries and indexes work: how the data is structured internally (e.g. as a B-tree) and what the DB engine is doing when you write a query, especially when it involves joining multiple tables. Have this knowledge in mind every single time you write a query. Inspect the DB's query planner output (e.g. using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) to confirm your assumptions.\n\n> How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what‚Äôs hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.\n\nThere are a gazillion tools for this, including basic ones like the Unix `top` command. I don't have experience with New Relic but I've used Datadog (flexible, but very expensive) and much simpler self-hosted tools like Prometheus.\n\nThe important thing is to measure, and then drill down into those measurements to figure out what to measure next. If your app \"feels slow\", add lots of timers to measure which parts are slowest. Try to reproduce the problem locally and use whatever local profiling tools are available in your language. If one user request \"fans out\" and depends on lots of different subrequests, then the 99th-percentile latency of those subrequests matters more than the average.\n\n> How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.\n\nTest automation is critical if you care about software quality. Write test cases alongside your code. For core logic, you can use unit tests, along with test coverage tools to help make sure you don't have obvious gaps in testing. For UI, the testing strategy depends on what framework you're using.\n\n> How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?\n\nUnderstand the general kinds of mistakes that lead to security flaws. There are lots and lots of these -- buffer overflows, escaping mistakes, confused deputy attacks, time-of-check-to-time-of-use, and so on. Be knowledgeable enough to recognize these, and disciplined enough to guard against them. Get other skilled developers to *carefully* review your code.\n\n> Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?\n\nImpossible to answer in the abstract. A system is \"overengineered\" if it has more complexity than necessary to accomplish its goals. So you need to do a detailed analysis of your actual requirements, and the actual behavior of the complex option vs. the simple one.\n\n> Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?\n\nThere are a lot of opinions about this but I'll just quote from [\"The Grug Brained Developer\"](https://grugbrain.dev/):\n\n\"grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too\"\n\n\"seem very confusing to grug\"",

Is there desire to  grow and take this public or is the intent to sell it off to a larger concern. That at least tells you if there is enough money or resources in your future to make real changes in your areas of concern. \n\nTo find your hot spots (frequently called or slow bottle-neck code)  products like DynaTrace and App Dynamics are helpful. There are many vulnerability scanning tools like Veracode, Black Duck etc. As for database optimizations that depends on your platform but lots of tools will suggest indexes to help performance and eliminate table scans. \nHang in there.

I think you're hitting on a fundamental issue which is that software development is an extremely unregulated and undisciplined field. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to any of the questions you're asking about, and still manage to have careers just cranking out sub-par code. (Especially nowadays when it's easy to just rubber-stamp the output of an LLM.) And on the other hand, if you push yourself, there is no upper limit to how much you can learn, or how much care you can put into your work.\n\nBut there's not really an objective, accepted standard for you to measure your skills by. There's just the outcome of your projects, and the judgment of your peers.\n\nThe good news is that there are a lot of extremely smart people in the field who have published a lot of text and video content that you can learn from. You don't necessarily have to take everything they say as gospel. Pay attention to the things they say that resonate with you, and use them as jumping-off points for your own explorations.\n\nJust as an example, you can find a lot of interesting talks from the now-defunct Strange Loop conference. Check out [\"Simple Made Easy\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich Hickey (designer of Clojure) and [\"The Mess We're In\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) by Joe Armstrong (designer of Erlang). Or if you care about security, look for interesting talks from DEFCON or CCC. Pick a random topic that interest you, and if it turns out to be way over your head, the stuff they talk about will at least give you more topics to research.\n\nAlso, check out software-related social media such as Hacker News or Lobste.rs (if you can trust yourself not to use them for procrastination). Don't get me wrong, those sites have a lot of bad opinions and irrelevant content. But they can serve as a good way to stay in tune with the zeitgeist of what other tech-savvy people are thinking about.\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah, and you'll probably find more useful advice over in /r/ExperiencedDevs than in this subreddit. To be honest, I think your questions are so broad that you wouldn't necessarily get comprehensive answers there either. But you can browse through previous discussion threads to see the kinds of advice that senior devs give.",

The process of retyping and organizing everything is a form of review that will make you engage with the content again.\n\nAlso consider keeping algorithms in your knowledge management system.  If you get a useful piece of code you can keep it and use it again, especially if you have to reimplement it later in the same course or reuse ideas in a future course.  You don't have to write those down but having a repository of snippets can really come in handy.",

I felt with #1 and #2 I was spending too much time trying to get the diagrams/sketches/code blocks \"perfect\" and was less focused on the material itself. \n\nI would print out the lecture notes/slides before the class (this assumes your professor makes them available to you beforehand), and annotate those notes. If I needed more space for code/examples, I'd use loose leaf paper. I'd then put all that together in a 3-ring binder. \n\nThis came in especially handy for my DSA final exam which was open book (paper only; no electronics). I had all kinds of annotations that were basically answers to the the multiple-choice questions. \n\nIt just depends on your learning style.

Check its technical documentation and specs.\n\nIt might be something that you can communicate with using a mechanism that's already built into Node.js, such as a network socket. In that case you're fine.\n\nOr it might be that it uses a lower-level protocol that Node.js doesn't support natively, but which is supported by existing third-party JS bindings, such as generic serial or USB libraries. In that case you can use those.\n\nOr it could be none of the above. In that case you'll need to either write your own Node.js plugin in a low-level language like C++ or Rust, or switch to an entirely different language for the whole project.\n\nBasically the same general situation will apply no matter what high-level language you choose. So it's a question of what **specific** bindings exist for your preferred language and the specific device you're trying to support. It doesn't really matter what the device does, be it a fingerprint sensor or any other kind of hardware.",

There are no strict rules, but rather best-practices and different perspectives (product vs dev vs devops).\n\n**The rule of thumb:**¬†Commit logically related changes together, not necessarily file by file.\n\n**There are strategies based on scope:**\n\n**- Feature-based commits:**¬†If your work package (feature, bug fix, whatever) is done with just 1 file, you should commit it.\n\n**- Progressive commits:** if your feature needs more files, you should commit in different steps (it can be finished or unfinished). This lets you track progress incrementally, create rollback points, and makes code reviews way easier.\n\nYou can also use story points as milestones. Like a 1-point story = one commit, but a 5-point story gets broken into multiple commits as you build the feature.\n\nExample:\n\n* Simple bug fix (1 file) ‚Üí feature-based commit\n* User auth system (tons of files) ‚Üí progressive commits: model ‚Üí service ‚Üí UI ‚Üí integration\n\nThis way you match your commit strategy to the actual complexity instead of being rigid about it.",

Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?\n\nThis question gets asked over and over again, and the answer is the same: practicing **with** AI will not help much if you want to get better at coding **without** AI.\n\nThis especially applies to the skill of taking a complex problem and breaking it down to simpler subproblems. This is what programming is really about, and everything else (like the syntax of different programming languages) is trivial in comparison. And if you're always letting AI spoon-feed you by telling you what bullet-pointed subproblems to solve, you're never practicing that skill, so it will never improve.\n\nIf you're unsure whether you could rebuild your projects from scratch without AI, then why not just try it, and see where you run into difficulties?\n\nIf you get stuck, try reading documentation, or even taking existing examples and seeing what happens when you modify them. If you insist on using AI tools, then don't ask them to write code for you, or even come up with a design. Ask them to suggest learning resources (e.g. documentation websites) or project ideas.\n\nIf you're still repeatedly getting stuck trying to rebuild your projects from scratch, then it's a sign that your skills really are underdeveloped. So go back and do the same thing, designing and coding from scratch, on a simpler/easier problem. Repeat as necessary.\n\nFinally, practice your research skills. When there's something you want to learn about, practice searching online for it, reading what other people have said about it, and thinking up your own follow-up queries. Don't just let a chatbot tell you what it thinks is the right answer.",

It's a JVM language thankfully and extremely similar to Java.. so all of the skills translate..just a bit harder to sell yourself to recruiters who don't understand tech much.\n\nI was interested in job hopping, but I'm a pretty risk averse person. I'm deciding to hunker down and slowly prep on the side and wait for the market to hopefully get better. I've seen far too many stories of engineers leaving their stable jobs and joining complete shitshows, or worse, getting laid off shortly after and not being able to find jobs.",

        "body": "Economist here. Lots of misconception about things like full employment and your nubers are wrong.\n\nUnemployment rate which is people who are actively looing for work and do not have any work  is the sum of three different kinds of unemployment: frictional, structural and cyclical. These can each be defined as follows:\n\n* Frictional - labor market entry unemployment. This is essentially people like new grads, career break people, voluntary job quitters re-entering the workforce.\n* Structural - People who lost jobs due to structura changes specific sectors i.e. AI wiping out whole job  categories is a form of structural unemployment.\n* Cyclical - Unemployment due to movemetns in the business cycles (recessions/expansions) this is the one part of unemployment rate that can be negative.\n\nNatural Rate of Unemployment a.k.a. non-cyclical unemployment a.k.a. full employment level of unemployment a.k.a Non-Accelerating Inflation level of Unemployment rate is when you have zero cyclical unemployment. That is Natural Rate = Structural + Frictional Unemployment.  The government estimates this number its been trending down over time:\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU)\n\nThis number has been tredning downwards since the 1970s nd right now its around 4.3 percent. This suggests we are rigth at full employment and any higher we are going to have a positive cyclical unemployment rate.\n\nFrom 2021 through 2023 we essentially had unemployment rate lower than the NAIRU meaning we had negative cyclical unemployment rate. That number has been gradually climbing towards the NAIRU through 2024 and if it keep growing we will have positive cylical unemployment (meaning unemployment because the economy isn't doing well).\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)\n\nNow why is this Sub-reddit going to feel  worse.\n\n1. Its clear something is happening with frictional unemployment rate. New College grades are having a harder time finding a job compared to anytime other than a out right recession. Some of it might be AI effecting entry level jobs etc. AI might make it harder to screen legitimate candidates. It might mean less entry level demand etc.  This is not the same thing as cylical unemployment because the assumption is that this is some kind of shift in full employment rate that is unlikely to go away if the economy is doing well.\n2. There is some degree of structural unemployment in tech. Tech overhired inthe pandemic. Take google: [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/number-of-employees](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/number-of-employees) They increased head count by 60 percent after the pandemic. They have now laid off about 10000 workers, but they still ahve 50 percent more workers than they did in 2019. Job posting rate on indeed indicates other companies did the same. Notice there were over 2 times more listings in the end of 2021 as there was before pandemic. Now in 2025 its about 60 percent of the pre-pandemic level.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)\n\n3. For young workers the job market feels worse, because people who graduated in 2024 or 2025, missed what was probably the best job market for all workers in decades, especially for tech. The last time the job market was this good for workers was probably in the 1990s. This means the people graduating now unfortunately are entering a world where the job market is getting worse and watched the people that graduate 1 to 2 years ahead of them enter the best job markets ever.\n\nAnyway I do think we are entering a recession. But the problem with recessions is that we don't officially know we are in a recession until after we are alrady in one. It tkaes at least 6 months of negative GDP growth for the NBER to decide if we are in  a recession. That means given the current environment the earliest NBER would declare recession is the beginning of April of 2026. \n\nJust for all you Gen Z kids, an economy exiting an actual recession doesn't mean the job market will get better. The 2008 recession ended by end of 2009, the unemployment kept rising for another year and took 6 years for the job market to get to the pre-recession levels. Meaning if you graduated college in 2009, you didn't see a job market better than before the recession until 2016. I can't predict if the next recession will be as severe as 2008 (hopefully not), but buckle up kids.",

        "body": "Corporate Tech Recruiter here.  There are a couple of differences I want to call out in response to some of these comments and to address OP‚Äôs question \n\nFirst, there are different types of recruiters: agency and corporate.  Agency recruiters work for a staffing company that services lots of clients.  Corporate recruiters are internal staff at one company and only\nwork on openings for that company\n\nAn agency recruiter indeed does have high metrics they need to meet and will tend to send LOTS of invites/messages.  They are usually working on multiple jobs and building pipelines for the various clients and skill sets they know their clients need.  LinkedIn typically produces a less than 10% response rate for recruiter pings so you need to send a very high volume to get traction\n\nCorporate recruiters do also send a decent number of invites/messages via LinkedIn but are typically more selective.  We do have metrics as well but they are typically focused on actual candidates moving forward versus connects.  Corporate recruiters also pipeline and fight the low response rate but because we are measured more on speed of filling a job, our approach is more targeted.\n\nSo why are you getting tons of pings when you haven‚Äôt engaged with your LI profile?  Likely bc of the skills you selected in your profile, your job titles, the companies you‚Äôve worked for, etc. These pings are likely agency recruiters or sourcers ( those that literally feed recruiters profiles to reach out to).\n\nPersonally as a corporate recruiter, I‚Äôm only  reaching out to those that have a well built profile so I can validate if they could be a match.  But it is true, we are using linkedin to source even though we are we are drowning resumes. For example, I have a SDE 2 role open that hit 2k apps in 3 days of posting with only 10% meeting the location requirements.  From there only 5% meeting the bare minimum experience.  Add to this the number of AI generated fake resumes, the folks that lie about being in the location or other qualifications and that pool of 2k apps is maybe 50-60 decent matches.\n\nI understand how tough this market is and how hard it is to be a job seeker ( I HATE the BS so many companies put candidates through) but it also makes it hard is as recruiters to find you through all the noise.",

You don't want to come off as misleading to the company, and maybe they'll be OK with a tech lead instead of a manager if you ask.\n\nIf the company's really gonna be a stickler about a manager as a reference, your tech lead probably won't fly. Yes tech leads are the people SWE's work closest with, but they're not people managers at the end of the day. If they call them, they're going to ask a lot of manager-oriented questions... probably including directly asking \"Were you X's direct manager?\" In which case your tech lead would need to both be comfortable lying for you, and good at lying.\n\nDefinitely don't ask someone for a reference that you don't know for a fact would give you a positive reference. So 1's not an option.\n\nI'd personally do 3. And I have done 3 several times in the past.\n\nThe fact I don't keep in touch and grab beers with my ex-managers doesn't mean our professional relationship disintegrates. We both still worked together, we both still have memories of each other, and we're both still professional connections.\n\nPut another way, if your ex-manager reached out *to you*, wouldn't you be happy to give them a reference? Why would they feel any differently?\n\nMy last job search I used a manager from 2 companies ago that I hadn't spoken a word to in 3 years. He was thrilled to give me a reference. We had a great working relationship. We don't keep in touch because we have different jobs now, our own families, our own friends... but our professional connection is still there.\n\nThe job search before that I reached out to a manager I haven't spoken to in 2 years. Same deal. Don't be afraid of reaching out to old connections, just like you'd hope all your ex-connections would feel comfortable reaching out to you.",

It takes a lot more money piled up to retire than most people realise.\nA veteran cs worker, for example, earning say $300k a year would need to have more than $4M in earning assets ( so their main home does not count ) - minimum, to keep their income at the current level. - let alone they are giving up future income growth. \n\nWe, of course, hear the stories of stocked up people who got good exits from companies. But it‚Äôs far from the majority - and not enough to make a dent in this area. \n\nAnd the final issue is that the reality is that a lot people still enjoy the work enough in return for that $300k a year‚Ä¶ it give purpose and something to do. So even if they could take early retirement financially, a lot will choose not to. \n\nI once worked with a person who was a technical founder, who exited. I don‚Äôt know his exact net worth, but his payout was somewhere between $10-$20M \nHe was working with us a senior dev, earning like $200k. I was having a beer with him on day and asked him why he was still working at the age of 40 and did not need to. His answer was pretty simple:\n- he had been a hobby coder before starting college and liked it. \n- he retired for a while, but drove his wife crazy. \n- this money he could spend on whatever he wanted, without concern. \n- it gave him a sense of purpose. \n\nHe was motivated, despite not ‚Äòneeding the job‚Äô worked just as hard as anyone else. In short he enjoyed working and helping others, but had decided that he did not want the stress of being responsible for managing or paying others.",

That time is golden because you still have a job, so in the future if it happens again take the initiative to immediately interview. Never ever wait to start interviewing.\n\nIn some companies you might be able to survive a PIP but from what I've seen it's like a lottery. I know someone wins the lottery but I've never actually seen anyone win it - and I've never seen anyone survive a PIP in the industry. The PIP is the company being nice and giving you a heads up that you're fired. Take the hint.\n\nSecond, absolutely don't discuss the PIP in future interviews. I don't care what you say but don't say that. It would be better to say you got into a fist fight over text editors rather than you got let go because of a PIP. Personally if they ask I would say that unfortunately they shrunk the team size. Think like a politician.\n\nYour first gig is the hardest to get! You've got experience now get that next gig.

It's how they got there. Maybe they explained *the answer* pretty well, but how'd they do on explaining *how they got their*?\n\nSilence.\n\nSolving an interview question in complete silence is a red flag on its own. I wouldn't progress a candidate forward that did this. I'd prod them during the interview to hopefully get them speaking in case they were just nervous... but if that doesn't work, and the whole interview goes by without them explaining their thought process, running through examples, verifying their work, etc.... I'm not passing that person. \"Correct\" answer or not.\n\nI've passed plenty of people that did really good on communicating during the solving process, but didn't quite get the right solution, or got the naive solution. It's the solving process I'm paying attention to the most.\n\nThe knowledge section doesn't really jump out as suspicious to me... that sounds about right. When I'm not in interviewing shape, I usually can't just rattle off SOLID despite using its concepts daily. But when I'm interviewing, you can bet your ass I can rattle off a textbook definition of SOLID, because I prepare.\n\nDuring the knowledge section do you have a script you need to stick to? Couldn't you dig into asking for some examples, or to explain why they think that's the right answer, or explain alternatives? Ideally you want ways to gauge understanding beyond reading off a textbook answer, because memorizing SOLID is trivial. Understanding it is what you're looking for.\n\nThe raw dogging is suspicious.... but without being there, and without being able to ask them deeper questions myself, I couldn't say if they're cheating one way or the other.",

This guy looked me in the face and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre worth $150K, $40k or what.‚Äù After one or two weeks of back and forth like that, I gave up and just started searching. About 2 weeks after I stopped talking about it, I think the CEO figured out I was probably not happy, and gave me their promised pay bump. I gave my two weeks a few days after. \n\nI learned two things from that experience, first you have a choice in what you spend your energy on. It can be fighting for a raise, or it can be find a healthier and better position. It‚Äôs up to you. Second, if you have to justify your value to someone else, and your salary is a measure of your value, then either you value your self too highly, or they don‚Äôt value you enough, either way, this always leads to a toxic environment and you should probably just bow out. \n\nNow, I don‚Äôt even really bring up salary points. I just tell my manager if I feel valued, and this is what I do for the company, and they get the message and talk to their manager about getting a raise because they value me. And if they don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll find someone who does.",

There's a reason why Asian cultures around the world, rank the highest in mathematics and science and absolutely dominate every single other country in the world over these two subjects.\n\nUnfortunately, what this produces are candidates that are so fucking good at math and science.

At my university there was no real campus life, more like a regular job where you go and then take the train back home (last time I was at UCI the huge area for parking freaked me out again lol, the universities around Boston were much more similar to what I've been used to).\nThen I first had to Google all those \"dean's list\" things etc. ;)\n\nBut that's been even worse for Asian CVs. Everyone's a medal winner for something, a ton of different ranks and levels etc. \n\nEuropean CVs are usually rather plain in that regard and more descriptive (longer CVs and photos have been around for much longer as well. When I started you also had to put age and confession and martial status etc.  - awful). It's fun to see that often when the descriptions are very mathy and technical, probably C or C++ mentioned, it's often Eastern Europe while for example Germans have a very business- and process-oriented language (requirements analysis (\"Pflichtenheft\" ;)) and ISO standards and optimizing business processes blabla Siemens mainframe blabla).\n\nHiring internationally is interesting but also exhausting.\nBesides the business lingua CVs the worst I found to be the Indian CVs listing everything under the sun (experts in Gmail, excel, YAML, XML, JSON, Jira, Slack... basically dumping their current browser tabs and pyproject.toml/requirements.txt in the CV).\n\nI'm definitely on the conversational side but I'd say half the people we rejected obviously didn't have a lot of depth in what they've been talking about (e g. tell you which model they used and once you talk about it it comes obvious they haven't even read the abstract of the respective paper). Other half is social aspects, obviously not caring about the topic they should be working on, being super hard to talk to or just plain cocky, forgetting about the interview, not letting others speak/speaking over interviewers all the time, suddenly sharing their screen to show their bitcoin price predictor after we tried to wrap up the interview 5 times because it's been 9PM for us etc.",

Then, all he has to do is not fuck up the interviews which is basically leetcode and behavioral like I did and he's in.\n\nIf that doesn't work out, then I think you really have to consider either masters or find other job like I did.\n\nHope this helps",

I don't think it's in your best interest to sit around and tell you that you're doing fine and that you're not struggling when you clearly are, so I won't. Chances are, you're part of the problem too. \n\n\\> I have been working in the same feature for at least 10 months now.\n\nThis is not good, if I'm being honest. Even in the worst places I've worked I've seldom actually seen a single feature take that long to finish without reasonable blockers. If the issue is genuinely \"I don't know how to do this\" then you and management both have issues. \n\nNo one typically just lets a feature story just creep for 10 months without bringing it up to either backlog it or give it to someone more capable. Not saying it never happens, it's just incredibly rare that it would go for so long without anyone checking. Especially if you work somewhere remotely credible or a start-up. \n\n\\> The last thing that happened that pushed me to the edge is that the manager asked a Senior to help me out with this feature and he just started asking a bunch of questions of the technical decisions I made and was ultimately confused and suggested we change a lot of stuff to make things right, basically saying that the last 9 months of work was poorly done by me.\n\nThis speaks to me that people are tired with your work and that you are not prioritizing your learning and improvement at all. You're telling me that you didn't update anyone on your work for 9 straight months? You didn't communicate with a single person on your team to get feedback on a PR or something? This sounds really unbelievable and I really doubt this story as being true. Whatever though, assuming it is true; I understand people are going to tell you that it's management's job or your senior's job or someone else's job to teach you and make sure that you're doing well but it's really a two way street. You also need to communicate to them properly, especially as an engineer with four years of experience. You're far beyond the point of being some baby junior who doesn't know how to get the job done, or at least you should be. \n\nIt's part of your job to make sure you're improving and actually getting better. If you're constantly bumbling into the same problems, constantly asking the same question, and constantly not able to get work finished, then you might have a motivation issue.",

As others have said, you're just starting mid to senior engineering roles, that's a lot more responsibility and requires a different mindset. \n\nAre there some things you could be doing better? Yeah, probably. But honestly, from what you've described, this seems like a systematic communication issue between the team. How large are the sprints? How large are the features that you're working on? Do they encourage you to talk to other teammates to get advice? Do they encourage you to find optimal solutions before implementing them? Or do they just want you to shit out a feature as quickly as possible before the Sprint ends? \n\nI went through something similar because I don't have a degree and every few months the imposter syndrome would hit me hard. But then I would reflect on my work, what I've contributed, what I've done poorly and what I've done well. Over time I realized that, while I have made mistakes, a lot of the issues I had were systemic and involved me to build the environment I wanted to work in. \n\nJust something to think about. Hang in there.\n\nEDIT: Also, I would like to add, no developer should be working on one feature for 10 months. Even in my worst moments on the job, a feature would take 2 months max before management or a senior could clearly see that I was struggling and would step in to help, or pivot me to something else. This is another sign that this might be management and not you. Again, I don't know you and I don't know your work ethic, so I can't say that you're perfect or anything, but anecdotally, and based off of what I've read, that's just what it seems like.",

He usually asks why I did things a certain way, and why I didn‚Äôt go down a different route. This either ends up with him agreeing it was a sensible decision, or suggesting looking into alternatives. When you reach out for feedback on a regular basis, acting upon it becomes far more manageable and feels much less like your work is getting crapped on.\n\nYou can‚Äôt expect every line of code you‚Äôve wrote and decision you‚Äôve made over the span of 9 months to be the best option available. That‚Äôs an insane standard. Recognize that all developers are prone to making mistakes or suboptimal decisions, and take the initiative to reach out to your senior developers and get feedback more frequently.\n\nPersonally I ask my architect to be brutal when critiquing my code so I can avoid repeating the same mistakes even when they‚Äôre small.\n\nWhen you go 9 months without reaching out for feedback you‚Äôre pretty much asking for every subpar decision you‚Äôve made to be pointed out to you all at once. It can be hard to take that without it feeling like 9 months of effort is being crapped on.\n\nAsk for feedback more regularly, act upon it quickly, and take everything you learn from it with you moving forward. It also has the bonus of making the work feel more collaborative, and helps build a good reputation with your seniors in my experience.\n\nEdit: just to clarify, when I mention getting feedback, I will literally hop on a call with my architect and walk him through all the code changes since the last time he‚Äôs seen it, explain what it does, and give him a minute to glance over it. It usually ends up with him either saying ‚Äúlooks good‚Äù or asking more questions and then suggesting changes or accepting the reasoning. This approach allows the architect or senior to take some accountability for the code you‚Äôre writing which takes some of the pressure off.",

We started doing stack ranking and below meet expectations quota for performance review last year, ‚Äúfollowing examples set by faang in the industry‚Äù. Was very chill before last year‚Äôs change\n\nRemote: we probably will stay remote forever but some teams require you to ge in close proximity of an office and may need you to go in once a week or two weeks, not mandatory tho. It‚Äôs mostly for team bonding and not flying everyone everytime. We don‚Äôt have enough desks in office so theres no chance we ever do hybrid or full rto. The teams that culturally go into office more often do not go in more than once a week, and no one cares if you only show up once a quarter or smthing. The obly thing here is if a manager goes into office then during hiring they may prefer you to be the same location.\n\nBenefits: faang level or better. Free lunch. Wellness fund to spend on fitness/learning. 401k matches, most general holiday schedule ive seen (yea random holidays we get a day off where other companies are working), unlimited pto with no need for request unless out for 3 weeks.\n\nComp: im not a SWE (I work on ML so we get paid on a different scale) so can‚Äôt comment too much. But i think we are FAANG level or better. On levels fyi we are consistently ranked top 10-30 most well paid companies. It‚Äôs very front loaded stock vest so first year or two will absolutely beat equivalent of google/meta/whatever, but it may cliff fast later on if you don‚Äôt perform well. So do well on performance reviews or try to get promo is your best bet to keep refreshers high.\n\nCompany: We are founded by ex google engineers and we are a tech first company meaning we pride ourselves in extremely innovative algorithms, scalable infra, SOTA ML (we publish a lot in top ml research conferences for a company our size). We are fundamentally different from other companies of similar or bigger size (e.g. etsy, ebay, etc) which do not care as much about their tech.\n\nLeadership: can‚Äôt comment on details. We are founded by ex googlers, but cofounder left the company recent years. Now VPs and C Suite (CEO is ex Google shopping VP) is all ex google burecrates who are more wallstreet persona supposedly. Not sure if its a good or bad thing but certainly still trying to expand/grow. We are more of a visual search and recommendation system for inspiration expanding into e-commerce and etc but new initiatives are being explored (or is it just wallstreet milking us? We never know)\n\n\nBut like others said: we are very hard to get an offer from (i feel like we are more picku than google sometimes). We mostly only hire ex faangs or equivalent. Even ex faangs get denied without interviews all the time. So try to get into the loop first and dont set expectations too high",

This is a very valuable experience. Part of being experienced is having an intuition about what wouldn't work, or what would come back and bite you in future. Now you know what'd happen if you let the codebase deteriorate. It's very likely that other developers are not happy with the codebase either so I'd suggest getting other people onboard with a refactoring effort starting with creating a decent test suite to give you confidence to refactor. As much as I hate the hype, AI is amazing when comes to disecting/explaining the code and writing tests. And if you manage to do this, you'd have a HUGE success story.\n\nI'm yet to met someone who's happy with their codebase tbh.",

You're not alone, you are capable, and if nobody else has said it, I fully believe in you. Build cool stuff you want to build while you're applying to jobs. Apply to those jobs anyways, because most skills are taught on the job in the first 6 months.\n\nI never finished my degree, however, I did take a lot of college courses on computer science. I have to be honest, college really does not teach you much in terms of preparing you for working on the job. If you think about it, it makes sense, a lot of jobs require you to understand tooling, specific frameworks, working within a team building, large-scale applications, etc. \n\nThe issue is that frameworks change, if you spent a semester learning Spring, .NET, NEXT.JS, they could all have insane updates mid-semester that would require the professor to alter their coursework mid-semester. With that being said, this stuff is really hard to teach. The tech industry is constantly moving forward and evolving. \n\nBecause of this, a lot of degrees in computer science focus on theory, data structures and algorithms, maybe programming language fundamentals and, if you pick a specific focus, AI for example, GIS, or game design or whatever, you learn that niche.\n\nThat's why a lot of jobs don't require degrees and seldom hire Junior developers that have degrees. Especially in today's job market. People with degrees can prove that they made it through their coursework and they might have some capstone projects under their belt. But they can't code their way out of a wet paper bag, or they don't have a lot of real on-the-job experience. You shouldn't let that stop you though.\n\nYou should know that you are good at what you do, you have the degree. You've proven that you can do the work even if you just coasted. Just work on a bunch of personal projects, building stuff that interests you. It doesn't have to be big or glamorous, just stuff you enjoy. You will quickly gain a skill set that you would want to enter the job market for. It could be full stack development, mobile development, game development, front end, back end, big data, whatever. Right now, just focus on building cool shit. \n\nA lot of programmers leaving college are in the exact same boat you are in. They have a degree, they're kind of good at coding, and they understand theory, now what? I'll just say this as a trade secret, 90% of engineers that have a job, learned what they know now on the job. Unless you're applying to mid to senior level roles or doing contract work, most jobs teach you everything during \"ramp up\" which usually takes about 6 months. \n\nYou got this, man. Take it one day at a time and don't be discouraged if you get rejected constantly. The job market is tough right now but, I believe in you. Good luck.",

That doesn't mean you're \"blacklisted\", that means you've been rejected/ghosted. *Worst* case I'd imagine from that is a 6 month cooldown.\n\nBlacklists are generally for people that do something grossly unprofessional. Something so blatant in the company's eyes that they'd refuse to hire you even if you were the smartest person on Earth.\n\nHaving scheduling conflicts, doing an interview with bad enough internet that you can't finish it, aren't *good* things. But they're not so terrible that the company would refuse to ever work with you if you performed well in an interview.\n\nChill out, wait 6 months, and re-apply.\n\nI have an anecdote from my last job search in 2024. I was in talks with a company that I didn't really care about, and they had a really bad reputation for WLB. I just appplied because why not. Well, they sent me an OA to do and I just.... didn't. I didn't respond to the recruiter, I didn't decline/submit the OA, I just... ghosted them. The recruiter kept reaching out to me, warning me of the deadline, offering an extended deadline, etc... and I just, didn't respond. Shitty of me? Sure, ghosting sucks in either direction. But it was what it was, I didn't have the energy to respond to them, I was in talks with other companies I actually cared about.\n\nWell, that exact same company reached out to me again to interview with them no less than 3 months later. And they've continued to reach out to me (not just one recruiter, but several) non-stop ever since then. Every few months I'll see a few emails from a few recruiters about open roles.\n\nI ghosted them. That's shittier than what you did. And I'm still not on their blacklist.\n\nYou're fine.",

So does your team actually need to produce a replacement? You say you're doing code reviews but how is that possible without requirements and a development plan?\n2. you say the team is oversized yet still drowning? Unless they're all completely useless that doesn't make much sense.\n\nThose inconsistencies aside, it seems clear why the lead position was open. Either the previous lead was incompetent and built the wrong team for the task, or they were setup for failure and that happened. Or they left on their own after either creating or being put in a failing situation. The cause doesn't really matter here, the vacancy is just a strong hint that this team is dysfunctional. \n\n I would start by having a 1:1 with your immediate boss (senior lead? director?) and be totally upfront about the issues. DO NOT SUGAR COAT ANYTHING. Tell them that you don't believe this is the right team for this project and need to rebuild.  Say \"The staffing on the team is not appropriate for the project.\" or something like that.\n\nIf your boss doesn't agree, then you have another data point on where the incompetence is that caused this mess. Schedule a 1:1 with your skip and repeat.\n\nThe key here is to be direct and back it all up with as much evidence as you can. I assume that you have had 1:1s with your new reports so you have some direct knowledge. Pull all their commits and review them. See if they're that bad or just complacent under the previous lead.\n\nGet your lead or your skip on board and then have HR start the separation process for all the dead weight engineers on your team. If you rebuild an effective and more efficient team and actually ship this project then you'll in a great position. If it goes south, then I don't think that just sitting around hoping for it to get better would have worked either.",

Never tell your boss or company that you're applying elsewhere.

Schedule interviews on WFH or PTO days, say you have an appointment, call in sick, etc.\n3. Again, no reason to try to hide your current employment. Just have an answer prepared for when they inevitably ask why you're leaving your current position. Never bad-mouth your current employer, that doesn't look good on you. Be honest or just say it was time for a change, you wanted a fresh challenge, exploring different fields, etc.\n4. Again for interviews just do whatever is necessary. It's 100% worth it to take a day off work or call in sick or make up some bs excuse. And if you've made it to the final stage, you know they're seriously interested in you and will accommodate for your schedule for interview dates/times.\n\nDo not tell your current job ANYTHING until you have a signed the new offer letter.

You now have the option to rollover your 401k funds into the solo 401k. This is opposed to doing a rollover to an IRA.\n\nWhy do this?\n\nWith a solo 401k you get two advantages:\n\n* Controlling the fund menu. Meaning you can have access to favorable funds.\n* Keeping your money outside of pretax IRA space. This is important if you are doing the backdoor Roth IRA strategy where a positive pretax IRA balance will influence pro rata taxation on traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions.\n\nThere is also a third advantage.\n\nA 401k has an annual limit for both employee and employer contributions. For 2025 employee contribution limit is $23.5k. Employer limit is $46.5k. So a total of $70k.\n\nThe employee limit is the aggregate of all 401ks under your name within the calendar year. The employer limit is **per 401k acccount**. In other words if you have access to two 401ks and actively working for both employers then you can, at maximum, have access to $23.5k + 2 \\* $46.5k = $116.5k space. This scales up with every 401k you have access to.\n\nSo with the solo 401k you can contribute 20% of your net self-employment income on the employer contribution side of things.",

I had been working at a sort of low grade data engineering job for a few years out of school, bc I had moved to a smaller town with my ex, but those didn‚Äôt amount to anything in my new job. I spent probably the first year there feeling like I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing. Because I truthfully didn‚Äôt.\n\nBut they hired me knowing what I knew, they liked me personally and believed I would figure it out. After a year or so I felt comfortable with HOW to ask questions, which is a HUGE thing. And to do that, I had to work on things to understand why I was doing them. That‚Äôs very much how I learn, and I think many engineers find a level of enjoyment from the field, and that‚Äôs what a lot of teams look for. It‚Äôs worth it for a company to invest in someone who will learn to do things the right way.\n\nRelated: The code base was a mess, as it turns out, and direction was directionless as this newly minted unicorn startup ramped up hiring.  So a few months after I felt confident they fired half the engineers and the other half 6 months later. This was a week before moving to New York. \n\nI spent 3 months applying to jobs and interviewing and practicing questions from my new apartment for no joke, 12 hours a day. I went out after that and enjoyed my new home. I got hired at my current company 3 years ago and found they had the same approach to letting us learn and tinker with things. Now I should be on track for senior this year and I know I‚Äôm a good developer in my own eyes and get the sort of work that reflects it. \n\nJust get in and get your hands dirty and learn to enjoy it, they spent a lot to hire you and if you‚Äôre asking questions and showing your thoughts to them, they will do their best to get you there. But really think about the content of your questions. Identify exactly the last thing you did before you got stuck, recall the steps. Reboot your computer and try again, clear the local cache (check your policies for this first lol), present it like it‚Äôs a problem/hypothesis/method like a science doc and let them fill in the conclusions. It‚Äôs their job, and they will only be bothered heavily if you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúidk what to do‚Äù",

I find looking for work now exponentially more difficult than in 2008.  \n  \nAs 2008 was before mass adoption of AI job bots/linkedin/indeed/glassdoor etc... the volume of job search related noise was greatly reduced from the cacophony of 2025   \n  \nYou and your competition couldn't apply for thousands of jobs a week.  As such you weren't constantly bombarded with rejection notices or notices your application was received.  If you got a call or email about a job you had a good chance of remembering who it was and what they did.  If you applied for a job there was a good change an actual human looked at your resume, and even read your cover letter as you were one of dozens who applied, not thousands.\n\nIf you knew a recruiter you could reach out to them and maybe be one of 5 or 6 people who reached out about jobs.  Now there are literally hundreds or even thousands of people hounding them about postings/potential postings etc...\n\nI am honestly terrified of losing my job, even if I am underemployed now.",

In one response you admit to not knowing what job you want in the field so what does a cyber security job look like to you?\n\nGeneral advice is go for a computer science or IT degree. Computer science is theoretical and is the foundation of how software systems are built. That knowledge helps in a lot of ways. \n\nIT is generally learning about software and how it‚Äôs used in businesses. Depending on the university you may have more or less hands on/practice. You skip computer science theory for business courses and technology courses that teach you the software/hardware that businesses need to run their operations. \n\nCyber security is an umbrella term that addresses many areas of technology security. There‚Äôs also information security, which has a technology component but extends to more than tech. \n\nCertifications are generally vendor based and show that you understand a specific implementation of technology. They can be useful but you just have to get ones that matter to the domain you‚Äôre trying to enter. \n\nTruthfully though, cyber security is entry level for people with experience in the fields in which they attempt to secure. It‚Äôs hard for someone who hasn‚Äôt had practice in using a technology to understand some of its weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Not saying it‚Äôs impossible, but that it‚Äôs unlikely.",

        "body": "I've been in the Dynamics space for almost 20 years and I also came from a .NET background. Your friend is absolutely correct:\n\n>it‚Äôs less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communication\n\nI go back and forth whether it's \"real programming\" or not. You're not technically building anything from the ground up, but instead are modifying or adding onto an existing application. However, that can be said for some legacy systems, too. The language isn't not hard to pick up at all and I feel like you can definitely tackle some interesting technical questions/problems. So, maybe you can think of it as programming at a very high (abstracted) level.\n\nAs for your questions:\n\n1. **Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?** I have always valued my .NET background because I understand what is going on \"under the hood.\" I've run into some interesting issues over the years and knowing how the framework works has really helped in getting to the root cause of the issue. I've also talked to a few managers at different companies and they have said it's nice to have someone with a non-Dynamics background.\n2. **What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?** If you already have a good handle on understanding business requirements and communication, it would be beneficial to take a look at the development ecosystem so you see what you're getting into from a technical perspective. I can only speak for Business Central, but the MS documentation site has a ton of information, including some tutorials: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al)\n3. **Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?** I feel like there is an uptick in the market, but I don't have any data to support that. As a customer, it's easier than ever to get started and the product does offer a lot. \n\nIf you're kind of over the grind of traditional \"programming\" and want a little more interaction with customers, then it sounds like it would be a good change for you. \n\nOne really nice thing is that the language has been going through quite the overhaul the last decade and MS is really working to improve the developer experience. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than when I started. \n\nI will say the only issue I'm running into is I've just about hit the upper limit of the pay scale -- the last offer I received was for the same salary with just a bonus added on. Because of that, I'm looking to make the opposite move and go into a more traditional developer role. \n\nI hope that covers all of your questions! If not, feel free to ask more!",

Finally write tiny JS scripts: practice let/const, arrow functions, map/filter and build a responsive profile card that can toggle extra info on click.\n\nNext week dive deeper in JavaScript. Drop code snippets in console to watch scope and closure - make a counter function that holds private state. Then write a basic Promise example, chain .then/.catch, and convert it to async/await with a small Fetch demo from a public API. Finish by building a mini DOM project - make a todo list or quiz app where you dynamically create elements and wire up click or input listeners.\n\nI mapped this into an 8-week plan for you if you want the full thing: https://doable.diy/plan/472xh88yv3AikgXNaFkGPr",

Consultants are not software developers for a reason, and writing code probably won't be central to your job. You were open about your coding skills with your interviewer, and they still hired you. They didn't select you for your technical skills, so they shouldn't expect much from you in that area. I agree that you should clearly set expectations with your manager once you start. Reiterate that you're unfamiliar with the specific languages/tools, but reassure them that you'll do your best to pick them up quickly.\n\nAt the same time, though, I also agree with another commenter saying to lock in and upskill when you have time. It's better to overprepare and chill than underprepare and suffer (or even worse, lose your new job).\n\nEither way, good luck with your new role! You've come a long way to achieve this, and you should be proud of yourself!\n\nEdit: Seems like you relied on ChatGPT for coding in school. Although not a good long-term solution, you can still use ChatGPT for your work if you're smart about it. Your company has its own internal chatbot? Great, use that. If not, discreetly use it on your own devices, preferably without sharing any private company data.",

Of course, since you already have a background in react, you may have an easier time switching back than I am having making that pivot. But I have read that this is a hard switch for others as well even if they did it prior.\n\nPlatform/ops work is a lot of being on call and putting out urgent fires. And day-to-day, it's a lot of YAML and not a lot of true code work, and its definitely not as creatively fulfilling as regular development. Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform. You may just be working on tooling and framework stuff that isn't a stressful, but anytime you work on a horizontal as opposed to a vertical, you are liable to be pulled into issues in parts of the system you don't know about and expected to help troubleshoot them during high pressure situations. Some people do love it though and you may be one of those people.\n\n  \nedit: TLDR take whichever one offers you the most money, but be aware you may be taking a hit to your WLB for this type of tole.",

You have extensive practical and theoretical knowledge of very basic DS concepts like gradient descent, regularization, data cleaning, A/B testing, etc.\n2. You have some practical and theoretical knowledge of whatever technique or domain area their team specializes in. Maybe it's computer vision or recommendation systems or something else like that. This used to generally not be as much expected for entry level but with today's market the expectations are higher.\n3. You have foundational technical/business skills, depending on the kinds of work the team delivers. A team writing production code for algorithms will want somebody familiar with using git and coding in a team environment, for example.\n\nMost people will assume you have the capacity to meet all the criteria but will want to test if you're already at (or close to) a level where you can contribute without too much fuss.\n\nIt definitely doesn't help at all that the expectations and responsibilities for data scientists vary widely across companies and teams.",
