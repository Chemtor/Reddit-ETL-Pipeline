Hired as a Data Analyst in an Operations team (5 people) serving 3% of the company, at three months a reorg happened and I am now the Data Analyst for an Ops team (that is only me and my boss) now serving 15% of the company directly (but I am also roped into assisting teams in all departments because my API/Scripting/Pipeline Dev capabilities and orientation in the company make me at a crossroads for a lot of interdepartmental exchange of data). I spend 75% of my time writing 1000 line python scripts that are either complex one-off multisystem data pulls or building custom pipelines for merging data from those systems in a deployable way. 10% of my time is spent providing guidance on data systems, admin on our business applications and dev on functions internal to those. 10% is spent doing huge data cleaning jobs (our data is a complete shitshow). And the remaining 5% is basic analyst stuff like dashboards, live reports, and light analysis. Hell one of my current 6 main projects is building a Data Lakehouse on AWS for serving business data and reporting.\n\nThe difference for me is we are a global SaaS company, but even one of our data scientists has come to me for pipeline dev and recommendations for data arch for a function in a chatbot they are developing.\n\nFortunately my direct superior is on the same page and helping advocate for a title change (which would get a raise with it per company policy). But what I did was took the job description, broke the tasks in the job description down into 'typical role of task' (ie dashboarding and light analysis is typically a data analyst, building and maintaining pipelines via script and platform engineering is data engineer, but more fleshed out than that), I then added in any tasks I do that are not in my job description. I then gave a percentage of my time spent on each domain to illustrate that 90% of my time goes to tasks that are firmly in the domain of a Data Engineer. Fortunately my boss is chill and an advocate and he took that and actually added supporting examples of tasks I have completed that are outside of my job description and is taking it to the C-Suite person he reports to so we can get me a title that reflects my work. \n\nI recommend doing something of that nature with some added answers to what is the value add for the company of each of these tasks.",

The promise that knowledge gained by doing this will give them an edge in the market. Faster results. Faster internal solutions.

GCP, AWS, AZURE don‚Äôt have a unified messaging like this. The simply exist and you can build what you need. Not as ‚Äòsexy‚Äô. They built an abstraction layer they control between the platform that can be overwhelming and the employees that interact with it every day. They are apple of platforms.

However, for smaller pipelines, it might be excessive. I've witnessed teams overspend on auto-scaling clusters when a straightforward Glue or EMR job would have done the trick.\n2. **Vendor Lock-In:** The more integrated you become with Delta Lake and Unity Catalog, the tougher it is to switch gears. One client faced challenges when their new CTO advocated for a Snowflake-centric approach.\n3. **The AI Hype:** The integration of MLflow and LLM is impressive for MLOps, but I've observed several teams paying for features that go unused.",

I knew I needed a repo for the IaC (AWS and Snowflake), pipelines (Meltano plus custom code pipelines), data models (dbt), orchestration (airflow), and some custom applications, I had different people working in different areas, and we didn't have a lot of time to agree on best practices for collaborative development - instead, I chose to have one, max two people work in each area (and thus repo), and we did ship fast. We were less dependent on each other, and if something blew up on our face, the repo separation contained the blast radius.\n\nAt the same time, we actually had some monorepo happening too. For the sake of fast shipping we opted to use Meltano to run Airflow and dbt. This meant those three ran off a monorepo, and it was indeed good at moving fast, but it also hit a scaling wall within 6 months of going production, since airflow had to run with only a single worker in this mode. We took Airflow and dbt out of the repo and into their own, and man, we paid a bit of a price - but it was worth the initial velocity.\n\nLooking back, it's almost like making the Conway's law work for you: we had a poor, immature organization communication structure in the data engineering team, so mirror that structure in multiple repos. If your team is collocated and cohesive, go reap the benefits of a monorepo. In this world of AI-augmented coding where context is everything, having a monorepo seems to enable that well: our dbt repo is monorepo, and it has such a rich context that many people in the company write analytic queries in Cursor with that repo open.",

For example, many things which _should_ be natural keys can end up being non-unique in practice due to dirty data, particularly at a large enough scale.\n\nSurrogate primary keys have to be unique, but can't rely on the data from the row to provide that uniqueness, so the guarantee that no two rows have the same key had to come from somewhere else. The basic options to guarantee uniqueness are:\n- Generate keys randomly and check for duplicates\n- Generate keys randomly from such a large keyspace that collisions are \"unlikely enough\"\n- Generate keys in some way that is mathematically guaranteed never to generate the same key twice\n\nJust about simplest mathematical approach that is guaranteed never to generate the same output twice is an incrementing integer sequence. It's also easy to implement, and produces an output (a smallish integer) that is very efficient to work with and which often has relatively nice properties for things like database indexes.",

        "body": "I'll take MSSQL as the example here\n\nYour question is more related on what makes a clustered index. Per default, the primary key is used as the clustered index, but it does not have to be. Anyway, when I say clustered index, you pretty much can think \"primary key\".\n\nI won't go to deep here, but essentially, the clustered index is the physical sorting of the table. If the clustered index is sequential, you add a new row, it gets appended at \"the end\". The number sequence is irrelevant, nobody cares, its only used to ensure the sorting order. If your clustered index is not sequential, the new row needs to get added \"in the middle\"\n\nThat will cause something called page splits. With a page split, the data can not be written where it should be, since the 8kb page at that position is full, so instead a pointer to a new page is written there. When querying the data for that row, the page where it should be is read, pointer to other page is found, other page gets read as well. So it is not good for performance.\n\nThat's why you quite often see maintainance jobs, that rebuild / reorganize the clustered indexes of the entire database, running during some weekend night or something like that.\n\nThe reason it is common to have that sequence as an integer is, the size. Int32 is 4 byte. Every non clustered index will reference the clustered index, so having a larger field for the clustered index, will bloat the size of all non clustered indexes, which is again bad for performance, since more data gets written / read / cached.\n\nThat's the gist of why you often read about and see identity columns as clustered index.\n\nWhy would you not use that:\n\nNow here it gets a bit harder, to not write a small book. The clustered index is your physical data on disk. The more efficient you can look up a value given your data access paths, the faster your queries will execute. On a typical OLTP database, you will see 90%+ read traffic, so read access is very important.\n\nLets say you have 100 million rows in your table, that contains a lets say zip code. Lets also say, you usually query by a filter on that zip code. Something along the lines of  WHERE zipCode = @@param1 AND .... In that case, for read access, it would likely be a good idea to create a clustered index, with zip code as the first field (you can create a clustered index containing more than one column). Since the search trough the B+ tree can be more efficient that way.\n\nIf you had an identity as the clustered index, you would create a non clustered index on the zipCode, which works, but after the relevant data is found in the non clustered index, it will have to be looked up in the clustered index to get the actual data. As long as it was not a covering non clustered index. It also depends on data distribution an the statistics on the table, an index is useless if in that example your data is split between two zip codes.\n\nYou see what I mean by saying, \"hard to not write a small book\" ?\n\nRandom Guids should only be used in special cases. Massive concurrent users, where you run into hot spots on the \"last page\" data needs to get written to for example (would be called latch contention on mssql), or distributed systems.\n\nThe reason for that is, that the data ends up essentially unsorted, which is not good, while also causing the page split problem, which creates the need for regular maintenance tasks.\n\nI'll try to give a bit of a TLDR on how you should choose your clustered index :\n\n* It should be chosen with intent, it is the most powerful tool for performance optimizing on the data modeling level\n* It should be narrow (small data size)\n* it should be selective. Think along the lines of a hash table, you don't benefit from a hashtable much, if you end up with two hash buckets, containing 50 million rows. Still a hash table... but you are far from O(1) in such a case.\n* sequential ID's can work but don't have to. They are rarely ideal, but are better than nothing\n* Think about how your data gets accessed, and choose the index to best support most of your workload\n* At least as a health check, keep an eye on your index fragmentation (there are system views for that on mssql, I'm sure there is something like that on any serious database)\n* The clustered index does not have to be unique! Sql Server, will append a small row identifier if needed behind the scene. It is not a good idea to append a guid in the datamodel\n* As a default when creating a table, the primary key gets used as the clustered index, that does not have to be done. It is usually a better idea to have a thought out clustered index, instead of just defaulting to the PK. In cases where the PK is not the clustered index, a non clustered index gets created, to ensure uniqueness of said key.\n\nEdit: Jesus Christ that ended up as a blog post pretty much, and I tried to be brief...",

So often the PK & FK were text based, and this was slow.\n\nSome vendors in the DBase III+ era, Foxpro, started copying the popular Informix & SQL-92 ansi standard, to have a database \"engine\" assign the PK key with an auto increment column of type INT. These early DB engines were only 32 bit of course.\n\nThey allowed the DB engine to lock the table, assign a PK automatically on INSERT based on last value used, write the record, unlock the table. This was seen as a more secure way, since the engine was assigning the key, not the application. Because of course in a network, you get network errors, and the application would often hang or use an incorrect PK causing duplicates.\n\nMy early DBA days mid-90's was handling duplicates on micro computers and mini computers (like the VAX). A mini computer used ASCII terminals, so everything ran inside 1 computer with a multi-threaded CPU, why they were huge & expensive.\n\nMicro computer decentralized the expensive mini computer, and you could use Wordperfect & Lotus 1-2-3, not just a homegrown ERP/WMS/MES application. \n\nSo all the micro-computer vendors mid-90's offered auto increment with their SQL db engine because the demand was there, CPUs were only 32 bit, and the GUID() or MD5() functions didn't exist yet.\n\nSome companies had to use datetime strings instead, like Wall Street, or the UK-France tunnel car tracking system, because auto increment had reached its limit in transactions count.\n\nWas still used for lookup tables, like a string PK for a product table, but category, sub-category, color tables used auto inc for PK.\n\nMerging data from various systems was a major PITA (duplicate ID #'s with different data) and by the late 90's the auto inc was being abandonned globally for GUID instead, or a datetime string down to the milisecond 5 digits, I've seen both.\n\nThen Lo' & Behold, 64 bit CPUs, and now we have BIGINT with MSSQL 2000 in the year 2000, and auto inc came back with a vengeance because who ever hits the 2\\^64-1 limit?\n\nI blame Microsoft for bringing Auto Inc back to life when it should have died out in 1999 and the Y2K bug.",

Really depends on what your database is doing although the idea of something being fully normalised when you just don't need it i.e. largely static data, is just a huge waste of time and energy compared to simply having duplicate values in a table.\n\nI used to work with somebody who absolutely insisted on everything being fully normalised, was the type of person who can't see somebody else's perspective, and could only do things one way.  Every time they saw a duplicate value - normalised.  They normalised so much they actually went full circle and started duplicating data, but across multiple tables instead of duplicate values in a single table which didn't change much.\n\nPersonally, I think normalisation is a lot more nuanced than it can appear.",

Not to say it can't be done although don't feel like everybody and their dog is getting their first DE jobs in this timeframe and those that do are the exception.\n\n>How early should I start applying?\n\nGet into the habit of applying early simply to get used to looking at jobs and what there is out there.  You might find yourself seeing a pattern of what sector is hiring.\n\n>Are AWS certs (like CCP or DE Specialty) worth it?\n\nOnly the free ones for me as it showed some sort of proactivity which one out of about 7 interviewers have commented on.\n\n>What helped you the most in getting your first DE job?\n\nHaving an interesting story followed by interesting projects.  I lost my job during the pando, taught myself and have only ever wanted to DE seriously.\n\n>What would you¬†*not*¬†waste time on if you were starting today?\n\nThis pops up a lot and I honestly hate this question.  The idea of \"never wasting any time\" is akin to not enjoying anything.  Before you know it, you end up becoming a leetcode robot.  And, by the way, this is the perspective of somebody who was literally jobless and paying all living expenses for two people through rapidly dwindling savings so stakes were extremely high in my case.\n\nTo answer your question, if you want to not waste time, then learn concepts and only concepts.  Skip putting a lot of time into specific tools.  If you want to \"learn Airflow\", you're much better off understanding orchestration and building something with some kind of orchestration in it.  This is the equivalent of building a table instead of learning how to use a hammer.  If you can understand common problems and patterns with orchestration, all orchestrators have tons of overlap.  On the flip side, Airflow will have features not in ADF which may, or may not have features listed in \\[insert name of wanky orchestrator here\\].\n\nBuild projects and ignore everybody who says they don't matter because projects are a lot more about getting you in the right mindset and having something to talk about during the interview.\n\nGet off the internet and write code.  Do not follow influencers.  Do not track the state of the job market.  Do not give yourself space to fall into a negative mindset.  Code, learn, apply for jobs, have a break, repeat.\n\nAt the end of the day, there are a lot of DE jobs out there and even more people who just whine about the job market being hard.  If those people took the time they spent complaining and doomscrolling and applied it to learning, they might actually be on par with the people who just cracked on in the meanwhile.",

You are doing a Masters in CS - honestly you can pick up a lot of good skills towards DE by working first as a software engineer and working around data systems. People tend to get into DE either down a software engineering route and specialising in software or as a data analyst/scientist transitioning into more pipeline and modelling work.\n\nThe main obstacle I see to a new entrant into DE is just the breadth of technologies and tools out there, for mid level roles we can find candidates who have worked on our tech stack and junior jobs are incredibly competitive as its a hot job title right now. We are in the middle of hiring a DE and we had over 250 applications for one open position.\n\n  \nI've been doing DE for just over 3 years, after 5 years as a software eng after doing a PhD in Engineering. To answer your questions:\n\nHow early to start applying? If you are doing something super data based then maybe a year or two after starting your first position. This would allow you to get in and really get to know a specific database and understand how to operate in a development environment. If you're also doing personal development and learning on what you're interested in then it could work.\n\nAre certs worth it? I believe they can be useful for getting your baseline but they aren't something I have chased. I would very much do it on a case by case basis. If you start at an employer they might require you to get certain certifications and they would pay for them.\n\nWhat helped the most? I joined a team which was pretty small, mostly focused around data science. My programming skills were really solid but my database skills were not great. I was able to learn enough database work to get through the door and focused my effort on using software experience to really push standards in the team and improve confidence.\n\nWhat would I not waste time on? I don't know. I don't think doing the PhD was the best use of my time but I can't go back and change that so I'm happy enough with the result. DE wise, as I've specialised into data I already had a solid foundation. There are technologies and prototypes which were a waste of time but there isn't really anything I would regret.\n\nI appreciate this might not be the sort of feedback you were wanting to get, I am only one person and there are different thoughts around how easy it is to break into DE. Good luck!",

Then we feed the good queries into the UI as a FAQ to guide users, as well as using the FAQ index to give the model examples on how to generate new SQL queries based on new user queries. Works surprisingly well since we sat it on top of a pretty clean denormalized data warehouse. New queries that work well are given a thumbs up on the UI and get marked for review before adding to the FAQ. It‚Äôs not generating reports on top of the SQL, but it‚Äôs giving some basic analysis to get the user started. Automated report building probably comes next. These tools seriously need handholding from architectural guard rails, but the potential is there.",

Your manager isn't necessarily your friend either, if they've been enabling this type of team for a long time now. If they are on your side, then that means they don't have enough weight to pull to fix the team.\n\n**So the bad news is** you can't fix a team that doesn't want to be fixed. So go job hunting.\n\n**If you don't necessarily want to go job hunting**, then talk to other people, other teams. Not about your team, but about what they want to do and how you can enable them, if you were on their team. If asked, tell people that you see potential to contribute more to the business and that it would give you an opportunity to grow more as an individual as well.\n\n**If you can't leave the team**, then the most important thing to do in my opinion is to avoid burning out. That doesn't mean slow down. That means reallocate your time while keeping up the minimum to the team. Burn out is not defined by the amount of work you do. Burn out is defined by setting expectations and failing to meet those expectations. If you define your expectations around the team, like meeting project deadlines, and those deadlines fail to be met, then you will feel burnt out, even if it's not your fault, because you put in effort and failed to receive positive feedback for your efforts.\n\nSo, set your own expectations, and set them around things that alight with YOU. Go learn some cool stuff. Grab a book about data engineering. Pick up a tool related to what you do like Data Build Tool (DBT). Attend a conference if you can (DBT Coalesce is free online).

It's origins is in OLTP but a lot of organizations are using them now for OLAP too. It's now even powering Vector Search use cases for AI workloads. Because of its multi-modal storage, it becomes really flexible in terms of supporting many use cases that requires certain formats - JSON, JSONB, Free Form Text, Binary, etc. \n\nYou'll have to dig deeper in terms of what those users are doing with your data.

I got hired to expand a team but one month in a consultant completely changed everything. Then my technical boss and the consultant were butting heads and a clear plan/path went out the window. I'm pretty sure the consulting firms plan was to get rid of the team and bring in more consultants. They absolutely refused to allow any time to learn new tools and used that as a selling point to bring in consultants. The \"it's impossible to hire a team that can meet the wide needs of specific software we want to implement. Zero time for a learning curve.

Many of us who work with large datasets can relate to the hassle of switching between utilities, and it's great to see a tool that aims to streamline that process. I'm curious, what was the most challenging aspect of developing this tool, and did any particular feature surprise you with how much it improved your workflow?",

I won't hide that I've leaned on AI assistance quite a bit, but even with that help, organizing and maintaining a \\~18k line codebase is no joke (medium-sized for Rust but still requires significant architectural planning). There are actually many files I keep locally for personal experimentation that never make it to the repo, which adds another layer of complexity to manage.\n\nWhat really surprised me workflow-wise is how completely I've switched over to using .parquet for everything. The format is just so practical for handling large volumes of textual data with lots of special characters and edge cases that used to give me headaches with CSV. Now I basically run all my data through nail-parquet and keep adding new functions as I bump into new needs.\n\nThe subcommands I find myself reaching for constantly are¬†`preview`,¬†`drop`, and¬†`select`¬†\\- probably use those three in like 80% of my data exploration sessions. It's funny how having everything in one tool changes your whole approach to data work.\n\nThanks again for taking the time to check it out!",

So at least once would be 1-to-1 and 1-to-many.\n\nIf you load a product table and a sub-table is color, another is category and sub-category, depending on the (various) sources you can have a product with no color, no category or sub-categ, you must assign a value for the missing data, so that INNER JOIN always works.\n\nSo you'd have a DIM\\_PRODUCT\\_CATEGORY with a surrogate key and business value 'UNKNOWN' or 'NOT DEFINED' even though in the source system that category doesn't exist.\n\nYou have to remember that DWs are report orientated and tools like PowerBI and the analysts using them will not appreciate having to render NULLs and won't be happy with missing sales numbers.",

First, don't throw LLMs at everything despite what the vendors say.  Like don't write a data process with the goal to incorporate AI when there is an algorithmic alternative that costs much less to run.  They might not like that you are not using an LLM, but it's easy to show why the LLM is a bad idea.\n\nSecond, focus on cases where the user can validate the output and iterate with the LLM.  The one  I am trying to avoid until AI gets more reliable is cases where you need a deterministic output.  So text to SQL, customer facing applications, etc.  Thinks that work are things like document lookup with links to the original documents so that the user can verify the information.  Also just applications with RAG to bring company knowledge into the conversation with the LLM.\n\nWe are seeing success with  stuff like software development tools and document-based knowledge bases.  AI integrated with tools has been helpful as well depending on how well the vendor did with the AI implementation.",

You may find yourself really enjoying the work AND the company.  In this case you'd want to make sure you're building relationships there and ask about a potential conversion to FTE after graduation, or at the very least an extension on your internship.\n\nIf you find yourself enjoying data-related work but don't necessarily see yourself staying with the company, you'll want to start researching about different data-related roles (Data Engineer, DBA, BI/Analytics Engineer, Data Analyst, etc.) and continue building applicable skills. You'll also want to be aggressively applying for internships for related roles.\n\nIf you don't have a particular affinity for data related work but still want to stay in CS / tech, then you'll still want to be aggressively looking for internships or junior roles. Again, the market is tough so just get those applications out.  Best case you land an offer, worst case you get interview practice which will help you in the future.  Speaking of which:\n\n>I‚Äôm very weak at coding and don‚Äôt know much about it.\n\nDo yourself a favor and start practicing leetcode. It sucks but you'll find live coding to be a part of the SWE interview process at many companies. I'm not here to argue how effective it is or isn't at identifying good candidates, I'm just stating the facts.",

You can hold the data in a single place and, in theory, any engine can query it. There is at least 1 caveat - you can only have one catalog and all engines have to be capable of working with that catalog\n\n2. To avoid vendor lock-in to proprietary formats. IMO this has a significant downside in that iceberg is the ‚Äúlowest common denominator‚Äù so you lose all the benefits of the proprietary format. It also seems unlikely that many companies migrate between platforms where having data in an open format would significantly benefit this migration",

Bear in mind that the iceberg standard doesn‚Äôt support defined length text datatypes - so everything may end up as varchar(max). While snowflake can handle this, many systems (e.g. BI tools) have severe performance issues with varchar(max) columns.\n\nMy view is that you need good reasons to move to iceberg, not good reasons to stick with snowflake native - which should be the default option.\n\nAlso, if you are looking at having multiple engines querying iceberg, the catalog is not going to support enterprise-grade features. For example, if you tag columns for tag-based masking policies in snowflake those tags are not in the catalog available to other engines - so you would still need a separate masking solution in every system.",

Which means that you don‚Äôt have to actually load data in Snowflake you just have to query your iceberg table which probably live in your S3 buckets and you pay Snowflake for compute.\n\nAnd as you grow, you might want to do some more transformation in the lake yourself with your own engine and only load final product into snowflake.\n\nIn the end it depends on what you wanna build and who you want to pay.\n\nSnowflake is an amazing tool, but you pay for the amazing features.\n\nIf you build your lake and transformations yourself that‚Äôs a lot of engineering salary to make that happen.\n\nI think those question start to make sense when you start getting big, but not before.\n\nYou can also create your Iceberg tables directly on your Kafka topics to simplify querying data.

I mean to say what are the downsides of having the data stored in iceberg tables vs the snowflake traditional tables? Are we going to miss the key features like  auto clustering , compression , time travel etc?\n\n As you said the catalog should be one and that may pose issues to all engines to work with that.

Add a comment describing what you think the code is actually doing\n\nFirstly, writing that comment will help to reinforce in your mind an understanding of what you have just coded. And sometimes, when you go back to that code and read the comment, you'll notice the comment was not actually correct. That will be a moment to cherish as it will clearly highlight the fact you now actually learning to code.\n\nTLDR; When learning to program, write the code and then add lots of comments describing the code just written.",

Sometimes you need to give stuff time. As [a blog post about monad tutorials puts it](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/), sometimes you _need_ that week of struggling to get something. That includes staring at clouds, sleeping, taking walks and so on. Part of problem-solving, including programming, is just letting an idea mature in your mind, and taking breaks. Trying to explain it to others, including to rubber ducks (\"rubber ducking\"), is also a good way of improving understanding.\n3. Learning more than one programming language, and preferably significantly different programming languages, is good. It's kinda like stereoscopic vision, where you can glimpse a general idea hiding behind two somewhat different implementations.\n\n  Some things you learn from learning a given programming language is general, some things are just the quirks of that specific programming language.\n\nYou'll get more lightbulb moments on your journey as long as you keep at it.",

If you don't have strong fundamentals, you won't understand why something doesn't work and you won't be able to vibe code out of the hole you just dug. Speaking for experience, almost every fundamental thing I had to learn on my own paid massive dividends for spotting shotty code, mistakes, bloat etc. \n\n2) C, Python, Javascript are not going away. Hoping to skirt by with one language or framework is pretty naive IMO in 2025. You're constantly juggling these things for the best outcome in my experience. Like, a project might use python libraries with C under the hood, that gets served to users via javascript frontend. \n\n3) Technical barriers are not lowering, they're rising if anything. Anyway, typical things that help are a positive attitude, being honest about mistakes/not getting something, jokes and being useful, not a burden.\n\n4) There are many good cases - you can understand something deeper, ask it to build some exercises for you to deepen understanding etc. The thing to keep in mind - if tomorrow AI disappeared, could you still perform?",

It looks like quicksort but its a very inefficient implementation of it. Usually it will create new partition arrays and concatenate at the end which is very slow and not \"quick\" like it implies in the name. The proper implementation is done in-place. If you are solid in DSA and coding fundamentals, even if you don't know the quicksort algorithm, you will probably be able to look at it and realize that allocating a bunch of new memory each recursive iteration is very inefficient. Almost all sorting algorithms implementations are done in place since speed is very important.\n\nThat said I think AI has huge potential value in acting as a teacher and mentor if prompted the right way. My recommendation would be to turn off copilot, don't use cursor or any codegen, and prompt it to not give any code examples. A prompt like 'I want to study binary search as if I'm reading a textbook, from first principles and with theory, without many real code samples, in order to learn it through and through. Be as verbose and long form as possible' . The output of that prompt is actually pretty good stuff, it was trained on textbooks so get that level of information from it like you're taking a class on it.\n\nA soft skill I would add to that is to learn how to learn. Ask probing questions. Seek to understand at a deep and innate level. Ask for explanations in different ways and analogies that help you understand better. It should be difficult and hurt your brain when you're learning and growing. You don't build muscle without pushing the limits of your body, and its the same with your brain. You grow when things aren't easy or simple or mindless.",

You can create a class/ function to retrieve the data from each of these sources, but then imagine the frustration when you have to create an interface that now supports all of these different uses so that you can wire in whatever getter object you want to use. Now imagine that you want to reuse the session from your API code (for other api calls unrelated to grabbing the previous data), instead of reinitializing a new session for every API call. And now you need to support some new interface for another use case, so you‚Äôll have two interfaces and so on and things get messy.

I've been programming for 50 years and commercialy (on and off) for 40 and I'm now one of the most senior techies at a massive bank where I deal with billions of dollars of risk.\n\nI'm not saying that to boast though but to point out that I \\_still\\_ f\\*\\*\\* up all the time and want to do something that I don't understand and just get \\_stuck\\_. I am often doing something where I struggle to explain it so I can't even google the blasted thing; or maybe it's just that the stuff that I find easy flies by.\n\nBut what always works for me when I'm stuck like this is to try and write something. But wierdly I am still resistant to this.\n\nSometimes I sit for literally hours trying other approaches. I know! I'll write it out on paper! I know! I'll draw it!\n\nAnd I'm a f\\*\\*\\*ing idiot because every time I end up having to write a small program to test the theory of what I'm doing ... and that will lead me to the answer. \n\nI feel like I experience a lot of impedance to simply switcing windows and opening up a new program and doing the thing.\n\nAND what's even more interesting, the best programmers I know (but of course that's subjective) do this too. Not necessarily that they get stuck but they do this switching context to experiment thing. When programmers I admire pair with me I see them do this all the time.\n\nSo that's my answer. When you get stuck try and write programs that unstick you. Using js this could be in the browser console or in your editor or whatever but the process of faking your problem just enough to think about it seems to be the magic sauce.",

Others made it into RAM allocated from the heap, and a few made it into static RAM.\n\nThat feature is [still around](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/137038/how-do-you-get-assembler-output-from-c-c-source-in-gcc).\n\nJavascript has the disadvantage for learners that it abstracts away all that stuff. Java and C# compile to byte-code, which is a type of machine code. I am pretty",

A lot of this stuff is relegated to upper division courses, though, which I think strains the student‚Äôs chances of connecting those lessons with basic programming they learn in freshman or junior year.\n\nI personally think students would benefit from a more thorough covering of computer architecture and organization. At my university this is offered as several lower-division classes, but due to the course content and lack of connection to higher abstractions already learned, students often fail to appreciate how important these concepts are to understanding programming intuitively.\n\nWhat made it click for me was simply internalizing that programs are really just two things - data, and transformations on data. Everything else is a higher-level abstraction made for our ease of use. Falling back to this simple truth has made understanding many concepts and abstractions straightforward with enough digging down.",

If you were to re-write this, I would phrase it as a question, and not assume you know more about how to teach students than the CS Department of your University.  It's good to be curious, it's good to question things, but remember they've likely been doing this a lot longer, and they likely have an answer as to why they choose XYZ first.  \n\n  \nI have a few thoughts for why they might teach Syntax first.\n\n  \n**Easy Victories lead to greater motivation -**  Almost invariably, everyone's first program is 'Hello World'.  This is a very easy first step that teaches you some basic syntax, the basics of how your IDE work, and the basics of runtime/compiling.  If your code doesn't compile, you have a syntax error, that's likely your first bug!  And it's easy to solve.  This will quickly become trivially easy, but you had to learn it at some point, and if you can see that the basics of coding is no harder than installing a few programs and writing a sentence with good grammar, that might be enough to get a few students who were on the fence to stay in the game.\n\n  \n**Most people learn what to do, and then how to do it, then why you do it -** You likely don't have kids, but my daughter is learning to walk and talk right now.  She knows 'danger hot' and that the trash cans & toilets are 'Ew'.  As she gets older we'll start filling in the gaps of why these things are dangerous & yucky, but it doesn't do us a whole lot of good to tell a one and a half year old about germs because even if she could learn the word, she doesn't know what it means.\n\nBringing this concept back to programming, One of the first apps taught outside of CS degrees is building an API with CRUD operations.  The REST routing concepts are pretty much set in stone at this point, and don't require a lot of creativity, so it's pretty easy to give newbies a tutorial and help them through the concepts as they work up the project.\n\n  \n**Yes this is eventually going to cause a learning plateau -** So yes when you get into algorithmic thinking, assignment operators, functions that pass a value, etc. you're going to hit a wall.  This is not easy stuff and you are going to struggle with this as you rewire your brain.  But as you practice, you are going to hit a point where it clicks, and when that happens you're going to be glad you have all of your syntax memorized because it will fall into place easier, rather than having to go back and learn it all at that point.",

People don't want to do hard things and the brain gets wired to equate ***difficulty*** as something 'bad' so they reach for their phone to entertain themselves. We have an entire generation of people with weak self-control because they're addicted to being entertained and doing the easy thing as a **way of life**.\n\nI'm not getting high and mighty like I'm better than everyone. This is something I see in myself daily as I grind through hours of difficult material.\n\nevery day I study I meet the following criteria:\n\n* 7 hours of sleep at least. ( focus / self control diminishes if I go any less )\n* I have coffee\n* I sit in my chair in my room and there is NOTHING in my field of view to distract me. If my butt is in the chair I am here to work. Anything else I want to do in my life is free to do, but NOT in this chair. It's just like a bed: it's for sleep and sex; if I want to scroll on my phone I can do it on the couch or watch tv.\n* I put a focus track for 30 minutes from [brain.fm](http://brain.fm) ( they have freebies on youtube ) and I just get through 30 minutes. After that I mark one tally on my whiteboard, take a walk outside for 5 minutes, then come back.\n\nRinse and repeat, with the intent to do 5 hours that day. Maybe more, maybe less, but that's what I shoot for.\n\nYou have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. You can train your mind to not freak out and rush for the digital equivalent of a candy bar but it takes training.

You may want to slow down, and not go at the pace the courses suggests (something like 8 weeks). You can spend a few weeks per \"week\" of the class.\n\nThe difficulty, of course, depends on the person. Those that have a more mathematical mindset tend to do better at programming though it's not a requirement. CS50x projects do use some math which makes it challenging on top of the programming.\n\nTo explain further, you might be a good speechwriter. You can tell a story of your summer vacation and make it interesting. You have a strong vocabulary and use sophisticated words. This shows a mastery of the English language. \n\nBut if you were asked to give a talk about calculus and derivatives (let's assume you know very little), it would be much harder to give a speech because you lack domain knowledge, meaning you don't know much about the subject you're talking about (in this case, math). \n\nThat doesn't mean you can't speak English. You can. It's the topic that makes it challenging.\n\nThat can happen in programming too. You are asked to write a program that requires math. Maybe you know how to write loops and use arrays, but the math part is the difficulty. If you were asked to write a program to do a Monte Carlo simulation or do simulated annealing, you might struggle even if you know programming.\n\nSome would say \"I don't know how to program\", but they might know how to program (just like you can give a speech in English), but not know the math so you don't know how to implement it.\n\nTLDR: Yeah, people struggle with pointers. CS50x is even more challenging because the programming assignments (called *problem sets*) have more math than usual.",

Also, cheat as much as you can: copy other‚Äôs code and use AI where possible. You‚Äôll probably have issues but that is where you learn how to disect other‚Äôs code. To use someone elses code, you should understand it (aka more learning). Copy, paste, modify. \n\nThis advice applies to learning anything: want to learn an instrument?

The port is dictating that you can plug any usb cable/device into it and \"something\" happens, at a minimum the device could probably charge. Well the port remains fixed, but the device you plug in could change, it could be a phone, a watch, a controller, a keyboard, etc. Or another analogy is a car, you could probably swap out the engine or the muffler or something, Idk I'm not an expert, but basically you still have a car, it still is this big carriage that can transport itself.\n\nIn your OOP program, you could for example have an object which is a component that can be responsible for interacting with a database, for example. Let's call it the DBManager. Now, normally your app logic would say \"hey, DBManager, get me the account info for user x\" or something. So that would work as expected, but now you could also for instance write a unit test that says \"ok the app will handle a request, and it will go to the DBManager, but instead we're gonna plug in a fake DBManager which just serves up some canned response, it doesn't have to query a real database\". We just swap out the components in the test only, without having to hack up all the code, and we are able to test our app logic without dealing with the database specifically.\n\nThis, to me, is the essence of the types of problems OOP is aiming to solve. I glossed over some details for sure, but this idea helped it click for me when I was earlier on in my journey.",

It can be applied wherever you might want to do that. \n\nFor example, in the context of back end web dev you've used Express to specify a chain of handlers/behaviour that each request will pass through at runtime (using .use(), .get(), .post() for config etc.). One way you could build this (I haven't looked at the Express implementation) is using OOP and the Builder pattern. You could store the chain of behaviour as state on an object, e.g. an array of objects containing callback functions and metadata or similar, and use Builder to repeatedly add to that state at runtime. The mutations happen through those methods mentioned above. Once all the top-level calls have finished, Express has an object that can be given a request to process, and some code associated with the object can dispatch the correct series of calls based on conditional logic over the received request.\n\nIt contrasts with viewing code and data separately like in other paradigms. Ultimately it's just a way to organise data and code in a program.\n\nMaybe looking at the GoF design patterns will give you ideas about how OOP is applied to problems commonly faced building software.

Do that first.\n\nIf your site actually has a backend (your Node.js code) then your options are basically (1) ad-supported hosts, and (2) paid hosts that have a free tier for small projects. Netlify is in the latter category, it's one of the few that really do give you free hosting with no strings attached, just some sensible limitations.\n\nAWS and Google Cloud are similar; they're paid but they offer a free tier for small projects.\n\nIf you're willing to spend $5/month there are many, many more good options to consider.

You want the code to become concrete applications/servers/‚Ä¶ that your public can use (website visitors, mobile application users, other companies,‚Ä¶).\n\nThe devops job is made so that the work produced by devs can be made concrete.\n\nA code always needs resources (like a server, a domain name, CDNs,‚Ä¶ there are many kinds of resources), informations (like username/passwords, ip addresses, urls, ‚Ä¶), and we generally setup different processes to fill some needs.\n\nLike, for instance, the pipelines you mentioned, are like pipes in a way. Once code (for short) goes in a specific pipeline, it ends up to the desired location. A pipeline could be created to provide new versions to a test environment, or to a beta version, or to prod. There is no fixed recipe but its frequent to see test/staging/beta/production.\n\nThe role of the devops is to try and automatise that. So, for instance, when devs deliver a new version of the code, the magic behind happens and the cogs spin until the new version of the application is delivered to the clients.\n\nThe job is highly technical and highly complex. Depending on the needs, the team can require high technical expertises in multiple different domains (security, kubernetes/dockers, azure/aws/‚Ä¶ cloud vendors, ‚Ä¶). It can be as simple as being a \"clickops\" (the devops guy goes on a cloud vendor like azure or aws website and clicks/fills forms manually) up to a more fully automated process (also possible with cloud vendors, terraform,‚Ä¶).\n\nSo, if you wanted to learn visually something about how your devops team functions, you gotta be more precise.\n\nBut I think management 101 would tell you to learn directly from your team, if good communication is possible.",

        "body": "Short answer: Yes, but first get an IDE like VS Code set up, learn the basics of navigating a terminal, and then watch the Harvard video AND FOLLOW ALONG.  (You can find tutorials for all of that in this sub's FAQ.) Watching is not the same as coding, and you will get a lot more if you are following along while you watch.\n\nLonger Answer:\n\nCoding is not 'Learn one language and fight about why yours is better for the rest of time'.  There's a very good chance you're going to learn 3+ languages at a basic level and a couple dozen technologies including an IDE or two, as well as multiple frameworks & runtimes over your career.  As a Junior, you probably won't get a job unless you can navigate a terminal, use a debugger, write unit tests, do error handling, test APIs through something like Postman, manage an environment through NPM or Docker or the like.  Honestly there's probably three things I'm forgetting.\n\nI've watched the Harvard video and the professor is very good.  He makes the class easy and fun.  But he's also fast, he assumes his students are Ivy League level and have read the source materials, so he may lose you if you aren't pausing regularly and checking documentation and course materials.\n\nAs for Python or C++; if this is pre-university, I think Python is PERFECT for you.  It'll be much easier and it will set you up well to learn another language and follow along better at Uni.  You'll have plenty of time to switch languages over the next four years.  Keep in mind C++ may not even be the language your game will be built in.  C++ would be for something like Unreal Engine, while C# would be for Unity, and Minecraft was originally in Java. So it's not like you can make any game ever with C++, well you could, but it's not necessarily the best choice.\n\nAnd yes as others have said, make sure you're WRITING code, not just watching videos.",

        "body": "I think whether Codefinity is worth it really depends on your starting point and learning style. I took Codefinity after dabbling in Python on free platforms like freeCodeCamp and YouTube tutorials, and for me, the biggest value was its structured, hands-on approach. A lot of online courses dump all the theory up front, but Codefinity mixes in small, interactive projects from the start, which kept me engaged and actually helped me remember the concepts better.\n\nOne thing I noticed compared to something like CS50 is that Codefinity feels more guided and less overwhelming. CS50 is amazing, but it can be intense for beginners because it covers a lot of computer science theory. Codefinity, on the other hand, is more focused on practical Python skills ‚Äî working with data, building mini-apps, and slowly introducing libraries like Pandas or NumPy in context.\n\nIt‚Äôs true some lessons can feel repetitive if you already know the basics, but for absolute beginners, that repetition actually builds confidence. The quizzes and small coding tasks at the end of each section made it easier for me to track progress. I also liked that they emphasize applying what you learn ‚Äî I built a simple web scraper and a basic text-based game during the course, which were huge confidence boosters.\n\nPrice-wise, it‚Äôs not the cheapest, but if you compare it to some coding bootcamps or other subscription-based platforms, it‚Äôs reasonable ‚Äî especially if you grab a discount. The key is to actually follow through; no course is ‚Äúworth it‚Äù if you just skim it.\n\nIf your goal is to move from understanding Python syntax to building your own projects, Codefinity can absolutely help bridge that gap. If you‚Äôre already at an intermediate level, you might outgrow it quickly, but you could still benefit from its more advanced project modules.\n\nFor me, pairing Codefinity with side projects (like Raspberry Pi experiments in robotics) made it much more valuable. If anyone‚Äôs wondering ‚ÄúIs Codefinity legit?‚Äù ‚Äî I‚Äôd say yes, it‚Äôs a solid, beginner-friendly platform for learning Python in a structured, project-focused way.",

The lessons are laid out in a way that makes them easy to follow, and the gradual progression from basic concepts to small projects helped me feel more comfortable applying what I learned. I appreciated how each topic had examples that connected to real use cases instead of staying purely theoretical.  \n  \nSome sections did feel slow, especially if you already know the basics, but I think that pace works well for reinforcing ideas. For me, it helped to go over familiar topics because it meant I didn‚Äôt have to constantly look things up when working on my own projects. The mini projects were one of the highlights since they gave a sense of accomplishment without being overwhelming. They also made it easier to remember concepts because I could connect them to something I had actually built.  \n  \nI wouldn‚Äôt say Codefinity is perfect the interface is simple and the pace might be too slow for advanced learners but for someone who wants structure and consistent practice, it‚Äôs effective. I also think combining it with something hands-on, like Raspberry Pi projects, can make a big difference. It gives you a chance to immediately apply coding skills in a tangible way, which makes the learning process more engaging and memorable. Overall, I think it‚Äôs worth considering if you want a guided path toward creating your own projects.",

You can‚Äôt contribute meaningfully to something you have never used.\n\nAfter using it for a bit, start looking through the codebase. Get a feel for the main language and all the supporting technologies (frameworks, libraries, build system, etc). If you‚Äôre new expect this to take a few weeks. \n\nThen download the project and try to get it running locally. Make a tiny change (change a text) and see if you can get it to show up.\n\nThen try setting a debug point. \n\nNow go and trace a specific feature and see how it works.\n\nIf you want a cheat sheet look at recent PRs that got merged and see what changes were required. \n\nLastly pick a smaller project rather than a huge one.

But, once that is done, ask the AI to explain the concepts that dont make sense. Then go through old PRs to make sense of what work has been done before you came along and tried to contribute, and when that is all over, just take on a ticket and start working through it. Each step sounds awful, because it lowkey is, that is the pain of dev onboarding. You also will need to be patient with yourself in the beginning as you try to figure out where to even make code changes given an issue to resolve and how to actually resolve it properly without over engineering.\n\nGood luck, though, working on intense projects helped me get a job at amazon, so hopefully it helps you out with ur financial goals too.",

It's rare for a company to ditch their code, find the next new language, and rewrite the entire codebase. One big reason is lack of documentation.\n\nI worked on software where the customer would want various features added. It had grown over the nearly two decades it existed until no one really knew the full extent of what the code did because, surprise, surprise, it was never documented. But even if it was, rewriting is only nice for the programmer. The end user generally doesn't see much. Rewrites often introduce bugs and leaves out key features because the developers never knew what all the features were.\n\nThis is why certain languages hang around. Many newcomers think the industry is quick to jump on languages like Rust and abandon Java, but it's not just the language, it's the massive amount of code that runs and works. More than that, it's the data. If you switch platforms, is your legacy data compatible with the kind of data the new platform expects? In electrical engineering terms, this is called an *impedance mismatch* (which causes inefficiencies in power flow).\n\nFor PHP, what I heard was it was easy to write, but hard to maintain. That is, people wrote bad code. It was blamed on PHP, more than the coders. It also came when the web was young, so there were still chances for other web frameworks. I'd say the 2010s were the era of these web frameworks. React, for whatever reason, won out over Angular. Vue and Svelte came later, but when a community heads to one framework/library, it creates a critical mass which forces others to join.\n\nFor example, most web devs need to know Javascript. They could use Dart, but Javascript seems more essential, and so Dart (other than through Flutter) didn't come to replace Javascript.\n\nOften, there aren't exactly technical advantages. For example, most people agree Python is a pretty slow language. Despite that, it's become the language used in numerical methods, data visualization, data mining, machine learning, and AI. How did it do that? The main attraction was its simplicity (ish). But also, it allowed for code written in C to look like Python functions. If it were written in native Python, it would be very slow, but because it was optimized in C, a compiled language, these libraries run fast.\n\nPython has a huge set of libraries that do all sorts of things. After Java, Python may be the second most popular language taught in US colleges. It's become the language to use for AI coding, so everyone jumps on that bandwagon.\n\nBut, it could have been Ruby. It could have been Clojure. It could have been a brand new language (unlikely). Python was able to overcome its limitations and be used in more compute-intensive coding.",

Often at the beginning it's not clear what should be spelled out explicitly, vs what's built into the OS, vs what's built into the language, vs what you should import a package for. You'll build familiarity and comfort with this over time. \n\nFor example, I used to TA an operating system lab where everything was written in C. It was PAINFUL for most students to internalize that all file IO would be handled by system calls, or that the computer knows what folder it should be referring to by referencing the file system relative to the folder the console or executable was launched from. \n\nThis is, in some sense, the point of hello world. \"Oh wow, I wrote 4 lines of code and computer somehow knew to interface with my keyboard and monitor (not to mention the hardware of the computer itself). How is that even possible?\" If you spend long enough writing code, you will internalize the reasons why this is possible in a way that will have made it seem obvious in retrospect. But it wasn't, and it isn't, and you could spend an arbitrary amount of time learning more details if you really wanted to. Your goal for now should at least be to get to the point where you build up an expectation for what will be abstracted away for you and what you need to explicitly write into your code.\n\nYou also mentioned some discomfort with dictionaries. It could be worth spending a little time reading into why they are useful, and some common cases where they are the go to data structure. You'll come away with a more powerful familiarity than if you simply memorize the access rules by brute force.",

The biggest lie is that you have to remember everything; thats what google is for; what documentation is for, what AI is for; easy lookup of stuff that you should NOT be committing to memory simply because its simply impossible, not when you really understand the scale of how much there is to know.\n\nso dont worry about it.

It really is frustrating in the beginning. You are forcing your mind to pay attention to miniscule details that it normally doesn't consider important enough. You will make tons of syntax error, especially in the first few months. But you get a kick once you get it to run as expected and give you results you need.

It would be great if you also remembered the syntax so you can really quickly implement it.

Set up a load balancer, experiment with kubernetes, use services like Kafka and write your services to operate on a stream processing model, try setting up a sharded and replicated database, write a CI/CD pipeline, get used to working with containers and IaaC. you can even load test your own box or a VPS to test its scalability.

That thing could knock my eyeballs out. I wasn't using my brain for anything at the time, so I would get up in the middle of the night and spend a couple hours playing around with it. Eventually I started writing code in Amiga Basic. Then I realized that Basic sucked, and I bought an Amiga C compiler, and eventually a debugger. \n\nThen it occurred to me that with these newfound skills, I might be able to stop delivering furniture. Actually... I delivered some desks to a warehouse in Phoenix where they were working on the first really successful map program for PCs. Can't remember what it was called. I tried to make an appointment to deliver some more desks the next day, and one of the guys there said in sort of a lofty, sophisticated voice, \"I shouldn't be disturbed tomorrow, I'll be writing code.\" That was one of the coolest things I had ever heard.\n\nSo at that point I wanted to be a real programmer. I started applying for jobs. Nothing happened. Then I thought \"Maybe if I SEND these people my code...\" It was a stupid idea, but it got me a couple of interviews. I went to the first interview, but they were already mad at me because I hadn't put enough postage on my printout. The second time I sent code out I put plenty of postage on it, and they hired me for Customer Support because the code I sent was event-driven UI, and that's where they were going. No more moving furniture.\n\nSo after a week of doing Customer Support, I went and told the guy in charge of programming department, \"Hey, I found a bug in the code.\" And he literally said, \"Well, fix it.\" So I fixed it. And then I just jumped in the deep end. Eventually they put me in the programming dept, but didn't replace me in Customer Support. So I just kept doing both jobs. \n\nAfter a year or so, they hired somebody for Customer Support and started giving me raises. \n\nReally, that company was a terrific place to Be All You Could Be. I just wish I had realized that. Because after 10 years, I quit, looking for something better. I didn't realize that there were WAY worse places I could be. Had to learn the hard way.\n\nI doubt that this story can help you. Things are different now. Back then, there was a terrible shortage of programmers. Now it's a glut. Also, I could do wonders with copy of Petzold's Programming Windows, a DOS 4.0 manual, and some DB stuff. Now the list of things to learn is as long as both of your arms.\n\nI'd say, if that's what you want to do, don't let anything stop you, work or study 12 hours a day or more, WRITE CODE ALL THE TIME, be persistent and focused. Maybe that'll work eventually.",

If you are worried about not getting everything down you may as well worry about the fact that you haven't mastered Scratch in it's entirety.\n\nUse cs50 as a springboard.  Refine and revisit fundamentals as you continue your learning journey as you need them. Dive into other areas of specialisation to build the projects you want to. \n\nAnd it's honestly pointless to compare yourself with others - whether you are really fast or slow. Prof Malan himself mentions something along the lines of it only being useful to compare the knowledge and expertise you've acquired with your previous knowledge and expertise.  Some people have prior experience, others none. Some people are interested in particular areas and will deep dive, others will just skim sections they aren't that into.

So what I have are a bunch of these scratch files in a few thematically named folders inside my IDEs \"Scratch files\" section so I can quickly open them and copy paste whatever I need out of them. They stay with the IDE, sync across instances and are project independent, so whatever I open in my IDE I will always have access to those. I can access them Quickly through keyboard shortcuts or the search function. \n\nThey are clean, searchable and cloud synced.

The 6502 CPU is one of the most commonly used CPUs in history. It was used in famous systems like the Apple II series, the Commodore ViC20, C64, C128 (where also a Zilog Z-80 CPU was used along), and even in NES systems. It is a well documented architecture with plenty available Assemblers, Disassemblers, emulators, tutorials/courses, etc.\n\nSo, if you don't have a particular goal in mind, and maybe want to dive a little into retro computing, then, the 6502 architecture is the way to go.\n\nI started with the Zilog Z-80 CPU as this was the architecture my home computer used way back in the 1980s. Also wasn't too difficult to get into.\n\nAnother option would be, if you are interested in microcontrollers, embedded programming, to go with the Intel 8031/8051/8080 CPU architecture, which somewhat is the predecessor of the Intel 8086 CPU. That's what I used at my degree. Also very well documented and easy to learn.\n\nIn general, the 8-bit architectures of old are way easier to learn than the modern 32 and 64 bit architectures.",

The teacher really just let me, on most days just go to the board and do the homework assignments that were the most exciting. I remember getting proofs and this being different from set theory, which was also a proof based class, because these proofs were countable. \n\nIs it important? I would say so. We covered things like logic, graph theory, partial orders, total orders, permutations, combinations, sequences, and series. Also, I think it was a good preparation for future courses in CS like data structures and discrete structures. Its not always required, but it can help a lot.",

        "body": "Nand2Tetris is basically a survey of CMPE, covering hardware through compilers and operating systems (which brings it back around to CS). If you want a better understanding of digital logic and how it's used to assemble a functioning computer, it's a good course and fairly easy to follow in a self-study manner. And it's a survey, you'll want to follow it up with actual compiler, OS, or computer architecture courses afterward but you'll have a better foundation to start them.\n\nSICP is a CS textbook that kind of tackles things from the other direction, though also gets to the point of building a compiler for a simulated register machine. It does not really get down into the hardware logic quite like Nand2Tetris does. If you want a better conceptual understanding of how software is evaluated, SICP is a good course. It's important to keep in mind it's context though, it was intended for first year students at MIT who would also be taking (or have taken) courses in calculus, physics, and EE topics so many of the examples and exercises relate back to that. Section 3.5 Streams (which also introduces the concepts of promises and implements them) has examples of using streams for simulations of electric circuits, for instance. They don't always explain the math that they expect students to know, so you may need to devise some of your own exercises or go and study a bit outside SICP to progress on all the exercises.\n\nOn that last point, SICP is somewhat less self-contained because of the context it was intended for, but is still a very good textbook overall. Nand2Tetris provides you, from recollection it's been years, with everything you should need to be able to progress through it.\n\nFrom the perspective of being a backend developer, I'm not sure either will really give you much ROI except that you might understand computers and software better following either.",

If you're building a project with a tool you don't know a lot about and you're not sure whether this library has support for X, well you go to the documentation or you google it and by doing so, you learned something new.\n\nYou will learn a lot more through direct exposure with the tool than watching somebody else use it, because that person will only show you how to use the tool, not very often will they teach you the weird bugs and edge cases to watch out for and how to handle those cases.\n\nFor example, I'm working on a simple project that deals with files. Before this I didn't know anything about working with PDFs and images, but because I started the project and forced myself to do it, then now I'm learning how compression works, how to work with streams and buffers, reading and writing files, converting to other formats etc.. Applying your knowledge and creating things that you know little about is what will help you learn about those things. If you don't know how to create a mobile application, you will never learn how to if you DON'T try to make one.",

As an absolute beginner, start by following a course. Don't try to build a project from zero knowledge. Start with any course that walks you through how to write code.\n\n2. When you're ready to begin a project, start with what kind of project you want to build. Be really, really specific and don't try to do everything at once. A good answer would be \"an Android app\" or \"a website\" or \"a bot that responds on BlueSky\". A bad answer would be \"a program that's always watching everything I do on my phone and my laptop\", that's too much to bite off. Start with one thing.\n\n3. Follow a tutorial on how to build that type of project. If you want to build an Android app, a tutorial will teach you how to get started, how to make the app, how to put it on your phone to try it out, and where to write your code.\n\n4. Once you have an empty application working, start adding things, one at a time. Start small, extremely small. Add one button. Now make that one button do something.\n\n5. From time to time, it might make sense to set your project aside, learn to do something (like how to call a specific API), then go back to your project and apply it.\n\nAs you gain more experience you will get faster at this, but you will never stop learning.\n\nGood luck!",

Only use video tutorials for basics like data types, creating variables , loops, if else , functions, etc... then everything else should come from your imagination of how to combine the basics or use libraries which you'll learn later.\n\n2. Best way to learn is to create projects by yourself using websites like [w3school.com](http://w3school.com) to check stuff you forget instead of watching more tutorials.\n\n3. Add to last tip , best way to learn is also ask for help and maybe get a mentor after you learn the basics.\n\n4. Look up tips/tutorials on how to read documentation.\n\n5. After you know some stuff you should look at branches of programming so you can find what you like to do , check the website [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/) and also look up videos online about branches / types of programming\n\nFinally, maybe find a mentor on the internet along the way, having someone with experience help you will only make learning easier, faster and maybe more fun.",

        "body": "Two communities on Reddit to check out:\n\n- r/programminglanguages\n\n- r/compilers (I just saw you also posted there)\n\nRegarding languages, someone asked a similar question on another forum I frequent recently and my answer there is the same here:\n\nThe language mostly doesn't matter. You can build a compiler in pretty much any language. The advantage *some* languages have are with respect to:\n\n1. Parsing libraries or tools like parser generators.\n\n2. Backend support if you don't want to implement code generation yourself. LLVM is a pretty popular one to use, and you'll want language bindings to it in whatever language you use so that may limit you.\n\nBut, if you're building the full compiler, just use a language you know, or a language you want to learn. I've written compilers and interpreters in C, Java, SML, Scheme (Racket, but 99% the Scheme subset), C++, Python, and toyed with it in Rust.\n\nA feature that is very helpful is good support for pattern matching (present in Rust, Swift, SML, OCaml, Haskell, and a number of others). But it's not strictly *required*, your code will just be more verbose without it.\n\nFor a beginner friendly path, I haven't worked all the way through it but I like the premise and what I've read in Nora Sandler's _Writing a C Compiler_. But it's not the only path out there. The reason I like it for beginners is it breaks up a common pattern in compilers courses and other textbooks.\n\nCompilers have a natural structure: parser -> analyzer -> optimizers -> code generation\n\nA lot of books and courses have you focus on the parser, then the analyzer, then the optimizers (possibly skipped), and then code generation. If your parser doesn't handle the full language, your analyzer will be wrong, and your code generation will be wrong. Sandler's book (inspired by a paper by Ghuloum) takes an iterative approach which starts with essentially the simplest C program and then grows both what's parsed and what can be generated with each chapter. The first compiler can only compile this:\n\n    int main() {\n        return 42;\n    }\n\nThen with each chapter the parser, analyzer, and code generator gets increasingly complex and supports more and more C features.\n\nJeremy Siek has a pair of books, both called _Essentials of Compilation_, that, depending on which you read, uses Python to compile a Python-like language or Racket for a Scheme/Racket-like language. Both his books are free, but they do tie you more to the specific language the book covers which is why I Sandler's book comes out ahead for me as a recommendation. Sandler's book is roughly the same structure but your implementation language is up to you. Use JS if you want, the tests are all C programs and whether they execute correctly.\n\nIf you want to build an interpreter, *Crafting Interpreters* by Nystrom is a pretty popular recommendation and free. A book I like, but isn't free (legally) is *Essentials of Programming Languages* but it also uses Scheme or Racket, though you could follow along in a language of your choice with some effort.",

In order to evolve and become a better programmer, you need to reach beyond just what you know, and go into that scary place of the unknown. It's okay if things take you a long time to do, just so long as you're learning.\n\nSpend some time and figure out whether you want to do stuff with C/C++ or HTML, CSS, and JS. I think once you figure that out, then you'll have an easier time figuring out what kinds of projects to make.

I suspect that we've already hit the limits of what LLMs can do effectively. They're impressive because they can pass a Turing test, but being able to pass a Turing test doesn't require correctness (and indeed may be limited by correctness: people believe bullshit all the time).",

We saw this to varying degrees with VR, 3D screens, blockchain, etc. Dangling the prospect of being able to hire fewer employees and save piles of money to produce the same results had VCs and CEOs rock hard and tossing irresponsible sums of money around, but the use case will settle itself like those other technologies once the high wears off. \n\nYeah, the vibe seems to have shifted. OpenAI is going into optimization mode, where they try to find the correct balance that turns all that spending into a profit margin before the funding dries up.

However, most people I know that work in this space (including myself) thought that all this AGI talk was very premature. Personally, I have not seen any evidence that language models are a good candidate for AGI. And the majority of statements have been from those with a financial interest or speculating futurists. Like anybody, even those with expertise, I could be wrong, and I would change my viewpoint when somebody actually makes a discovery that puts language models on the path to AGI. It could happen tomorrow. The paper could be about to be published right now... but until then, no, language models can do a lot of impressive things, but they are not likely to be AGI (or ASI of course).",

The latest quantum leap was reasoning tokens. Now companies are betting in agentic systems. And agentic systems suck balls specifically because of compounding errors.

My go to test is to let ChatGPT generate an image of a sailing catamaran using Dall-E and although the result looks nice at first, the generated image still shows a badly functioning yacht.\n\nThings are different when you start using local LLMs. Due to hardware restrictions, my currently best running LLM ist mistral:7b, a downsized version with usable coding knowledge, language support and overall world knowledge. I can use it to improve code and get help when I am looking for what I need to change to achieve a specific behavior (take THAT, CSS!). It is not perfect, but so far it was useful in my work with Angular and NestJS.\n\nThis is also supported by the availability of systems with a lot of shared memory. Although it is slower than real VRAM, it makes it possible to run larger models on a MacBook or something powered by AMDs Ryzen AI series. A medium sized LLM (20-30 billion parameters) can have very good world knowledge and if it is optimized for a specific purpose (reading documents, helping to code, looking for abnormalities in log files) has the potential to safe a lot of time and work.\n\nAll that said, the use of LLMs can lead to catastrophic misinterpretations of the data given, so the models have to be tuned to give info on their thought process so you can manage and fine tune them. The way of Google to dumb down search and try to shove down Gemini as the next big thing is an example of what not to do - the results are sometimes funny at best, but can be deadly. (Maybe we, as humans, have the wrong perspective of what AI should replace?)\n\nThere are a lot of areas where AI hasn't even begun to get traction, although it has the potential. Just today I was taking measurements of my trailer and scribbling it down - a well trained LLM could put all those notes right into CAD and make suggestions of how and what to measure. Or just use a 3D-Scan to do it by itself.",

Executive comes up with \"great idea\" that is neither great nor feasible\n\n2. Executive hands idea down to VP, who loves the idea\n\n3. Executive hands project down to Director with timelines and super aggressive goals. Director already starts getting nervous because this idea sounds unreasonable, and so do the timelines. Also, maybe not that great of an idea once you layer reality on it\n\n4. Executive breaks into smaller projects, hands to Managers. Managers shitting bricks because they *know* this shit is unreasonable and they start pushing back while simultaneously getting ICs lined up on how to get things moving in a direction that is most likely to be palatable to leadership when it inevitbaly becomes clear the original idea wasn't possible.\n\n5. Manager pushes on Director, Director pushes on VP, VP punches Director in face, Director pushes back again on VP, VP starts softening language with executive, executive punches VP in face, VP pushes back a bit harder, executive punches again, VP remembers that executive doesn't know shit so he starts redifining things so that they sound like what the executive wanted while banking on the possibility that the executive doesn't even really know what they want. It works\n\n6. Manager gets go ahead to build the thing they've been building already. It is not what executive wanted, but executive doesn't care as long as he can sell it, so everyone - executive, vp, director, manager, ICs - now have to make a bunch of powerpoint slides to convince everyone else that the bullshit they built - which was good and useful - is actually the greates development ever.",

AI isn't replacing entire industries, but companies are so worried about missing out, they are throwing tons of money at it (and likely getting very little return). So, AI is a distraction, but it's drawing lots of investment that could be spent elsewhere like employee salary and investment in non-AI projects. A lot of professional services companies are trying to become AI gurus, because that's what clients are currently looking for. That's part of why I think it's a bubble that has to pop eventually. I've seen lots of non-technical consultants opening up small AI consulting companies, becoming heads of AI practices (mostly sales and management roles), and so many people going nuts on LinkedIn.

Most of the people are just trying to become business world influencers. \n\nThere are certainly other factors contributing to the poor job market.\n\nOne thing that feels unique is the current US administration. It seems to be actively trying to destroy the job market. I'll be blunt, I think there are a lot of unqualified people in the current administration, and I'm not sure what their main motivators outside of personal wealth are. They want to lower interest rates. Well, a weak job market will help with that. And they are actively firing thousands of federal employees, killing grants, and all sorts of other actions putting people out of work. But they don't want people to think the job market is weak, because \"Republicans are supposed to be good for the economy.\" We'll have to see what long-term impact it has and how long it takes to recover. Other countries are also dealing with inflation, but it feels like the US is dealing with inflation and a bunch of other things. I'm no economist, but I've read a few people argue the tariff policy reminds them of the time before the Great Depression. So, things might get really bad and \"it's different this time.\" Or, this is a spot where I can be in the camp that predicted things incorrectly, which has happened plenty of times. \n\nI was originally in the camp that the job market would turn around in a year or two in 2022. Thinking back to working during the dotcom bubble, it might have taken 4 years or so for a recovery. But the government was trying to improve things. Now, it feels like the exact opposite. We're in a weird timeline, but maybe it's my turn to be paranoid.",

They're justifying layoffs as cost-cutting due to AI as they don't want to admit they overhired. Pair that with the huge cultural changes affecting large parts of the industry and this is definitely a pivot point for tech, if not totally unprecedented.\n\n\nThe more important point is that the number of junior roles in the tech industry has crashed in a way that, historically, it never has, and that specifically may be due to (misplaced) confidence that AI can improve the productivity of mid- and senior-level workers to a degree that means junior employees are no longer necessary. It's not that LLMs are yet that capable, it's that executives believe they are.",

Once you replace all of them, you no longer need real estate.\n\nOnce you replace software engineers, it's a simple and easy path to replace all jobs except physical labor jobs.",

Is it secure, scalable, extensible, understandable, handle errors correctly, etc?

Lawyer? They can't tell if the legal brief that was written is good or not. Doctor? They can't tell if the results the AI spits out are correct. Accountant?

        "body": "Companies will always make the bold claims that will sell their product. Having worked in tech for my entire career since 2009 (banks, big tech, startups, scale-ups), I can see why a lot of businesses really want it to be true:\n\n\\- Many regular non-tech businesses (think banks, insurance companies, etc) really suck at delivering software projects, most of their initiatives either outright fail, or go massively over-budget. They also have big consultancies (like Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, E&Y, etc) charging them massive fees for embedded software development squads - mainly because they themselves can't properly deliver.\n\n\\- Many business people still think in the mindset of build vs run for how the world works. i.e I spend time and money to build something (with a team specialising in building), then I get to run it (without the builders). Think of something like building a house or an apartment block - after the house is complete you don't need structural engineers, electricians and carpenters hanging around on full-time salaries - they leave, you don't need them anymore. This is how a lot of people expect the world to work for most things, but its not really the case with software products / platforms. There is a real desire from many businesses to have it become this way. For example, if I'm a successful apparel retailer like Nike / Adidas - my business would be way more profitable if I only had to really fork out software development costs during major projects / uplifts. In the absence of those types of projects it would be way better to not have software development salaries bloating operational expenses, and would be able to deliver way better returns to shareholders.\n\nOn the above points, I want to make it clear that I'm mainly talking about companies where you don't really think of them as a tech company, but because of how important web/mobile/digital channels are these days almost every company has had to build software out of pure necessity. If you think of companies like Nike, Walmart, Nespresso, banks, insurance companies, etc - you don't intuitively think of them as a tech company, yet over the past decade(s) software development salaries/costs have become a big part of their operational expenses, and how they operate in general. A lot of people in business want have their cake and eat it too - they want to have a strong digital presence but without necessarily being a tech company and employing tonnes of software engineers.",

This is coming from someone who is a senior engineer and got here much faster than other engineers with 3-4x my experience haha.\n\nThere is usually a misconception that \"being a senior\" means you need to be this 10X coder or your technical skills need to be at a different level. That is false.\n\nIn my experience, for being a senior, one needs to hone in on their non-technical skills - how they build trust, how they build alignment, how they lead efforts, etc. For that a different skillset is required, which imo is absolutely crucial if you want to start getting that recognition, and eventually get promoted. I have talked a lot more about that in this post I made recently [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mhmy7l/junior\\_midlevel\\_engineers\\_feeling\\_invisible\\_or/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mhmy7l/junior_midlevel_engineers_feeling_invisible_or/) so hopefully that provides more insight.\n\n  \nFeel free to reach out, happy to help!",

Otherwise, you might find yourself putting it off and never get around to it.  It's a form of career security.\n\nNext, I would recommend  doing some  projects with low-level programming.  It will help build your profile.\n\nThe idea is to future-proof yourself as much as possible.  Being skilled in one thing will matter a lot. Otherwise, you might end up like me: chasing everything \"because I know I can do it\"  :(",

A junior who quickly learns the above and acts more grown up will do well \"overseeing\" LLM coders. How to upskill people like that is a difficult question. One of the most useful classes in my university ended up being our software engineering class where we went through more \"BS\" type stuff like requirements, project planning, etc and built a big project as a class. Universities might need to dedicate another semester to that type of classes including LLM coding as part of building something large and making changes\n\n\nOf course, the next couple of years are going to be rough as companies try to upskill their current juniors, drying up the need for new juniors. \n\nIdeally what would happen is that any efficiency improvements would result in more projects so the labor market would be the same, but we're in this in between where that hasn't materialized, so companies are hedging their bets and holding off hiring until they know if there are efficiency improvements and more projects can be put in their 2026 plans and/or how their HR budgets change.",

Multiply that kind of running cost by 10 when investors inevitably starts asking for ROI, and... suddenly devs don't seem all that expensive anymore...",

However, that doesn't mean that the \"final price\" will be higher than that of human devs. Could be break even. Could be cheaper.\n\nThis will also depend on the capabilities of the tools. If you can make copilot sit in a meeting (or read auto-generated meeting minutes), go through jira issues, translate user requirements into well-defined features, implement those features, write and fix unit tests, debug and fix any issues, test everything, update docs, and merge -- then yeah, I guess we are fucked.\n\nIf, on the other hand, a human will need to be the interface somewhere, or will need to supervisor the bot, then companies will still need to employ software devs. Granted, with different job descriptions.\n\nSo I wouldn't rely 100% on MSFT greed. Instead, learn to use the tools so that if a company decides to adopt AI bots, you can be the one integrating and supervising them.",

Think about mass produced clothing or even food.  The desire for more and higher quality of those things scales with their relative ease in production.  I don't understand why software wouldn't follow a similar pattern. We still have tailors and farmers today, it's just that their jobs are very different than they were before certain tools existed.\n\nThe 'AI will replace devs' narrative is a bad take because it assumes the desire for software is a known or static amount.  It will replace devs doing today's work, but all that means is that the role of developer changes.  That's been true since the job of developer existed though.  New tools make the work different.",

This is after a week of working overtime to keep up by the way.\n\nI could immediately see my team eyeing up my jobs, just ready to get one over on me to be above me on the pile.\n\nMonth after month, I would be bottom of the pile despite 70 hour weeks. After a while of this, I decided, you know what, I am contracted at 37 hours a week, I am not getting overtime, I am now starting at 9am and finishing at 5:30pm.\n\nMy check ins and \"performance\" fell off a cliff. I was warned that my performance was down, I wrote an email response explaining that I was no longer going to be doing free overtime. I also sent a copy to HR, but separately, not CC'd in.\n\nI had work colleagues warn me in a friendly way that I'd get my butt spanked if I didn't rethink it. I was sent another email a week later demanding to know why my performance was so poor. I reiterated my working hours. The response, a bit more interesting this time, stated that the tasks I was set should be easily completed in my working week and if I thought not then I should request a meeting to discuss my performance.\n\nOK says I, let's have that meeting. And boy, did we. I had my phone in my pocket recording the meeting. It quickly descended into a meeting where my manager was downgrading sprint estimates to force it into a week's of work. Apparently, creating a process to read, modify and re-save CSV files is a sprint score of 1 suddenly - not the 8 points we did have it set to!\n\nDespite his hammering down of SPRINT estimates which actually all ended up with SPRINT score 1, he still couldn't fit it into my week. What an interesting conversation to have recorded.\n\nI didn't even get 1/4 of the way through my SPRINT, my manager discussed the idea of my lack of performance. This would go on for months. I would keep logs, he would keep complaining, he would call me with passive aggressive advice to help me out, asking if the best use of my time really was to go and see Slayer that weekend or try to catch up with my work, citing all my colleagues who were so bent out of shape that they were declaring all their work being done in the 37 hour work week. I refused to do it.\n\nEventually, I was put on a PIP. Long story short, I failed, so I was asked to attend an HR interview citing my suitability for the role and discussion of continued employment. I filled a formal grievance at work and told them that I had no option but to resign due to the unreasonable mismanagement of workload. \n\nIt took about 3 months but I was going down the constructive dismissal route. I didn't know what I was doing and was taking bits of advice from here and there. One day, HR called up and on a conference call, asked me if we could come to an agreement. In short, I settled for ¬£12,000 and a standard reference.",

I've seen people refuse to help unless it was documented that they'd benefit (e.g., as a mentor), and I've had coworkers who'd always give very \"constructive\" feedback to try taking people down a peg \n* Hold the stakeholders hostage: If your manager decides who to pip, make sure you own a process that can't fail, and never set it up to be handed off.

        "body": "Despite what it may say on a job posting, most of the requirements aren‚Äôt actually requirements. Job posting requirements are usually a wish list for the perfect candidate and should be treated as such. The person hired almost never meets all the requirements.\n\nThat said, yeah, if you‚Äôre self taught or even a bootcamp grad the market is not going to be a kind place for you right now. Part of a good hiring process is about reducing risk. Generally, for entry level positions, candidates with CS degrees are stronger hires than non-CS degree candidates. There‚Äôs still strong candidates in both groups, but their tend to be fewer really terrible candidates who have a CS degree since many of them were flushed out in college.\n\nRight now there‚Äôs a lot of candidates with CS degrees looking for jobs, so most companies don‚Äôt have a ton of incentive to look in that more risky pool of candidates.\n\nAs someone who broke into the industry over a decade ago with no degree, I really do wish I had something better to tell you, but honestly, that‚Äôs just where the market is at right now.\n\nThe best advice I can give you is:\n\n- Dont let the CS degree requirement in a job posting deter you from applying. If you feel like you can do the job and you meet 60%-70% of the requirements, just apply. Realize it‚Äôs a long shot and don‚Äôt get your hopes up, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to shoot off a resume. You never know.\n\n- You need to focus on getting your foot in the door anywhere. Focus on smaller companies that aren‚Äôt ‚Äútech‚Äù companies. You need to get a job on your resume that says ‚Äúdeveloper‚Äù, ‚Äúsoftware engineer‚Äù, or something like that. Remember what I said earlier about risk? If you can show that someone else paid you for a year to be a developer, that tells other companies that, on some level, you can do the job, which reduces risk. Again, I realize you‚Äôre probably applying to just about anything you can, but I want to emphasize that if your goal is really to break into the industry then you should prioritize getting experience in the field on your resume above all else.",

The main thing I hate is the commute, but thankfully my boss is pretty flexible. The usual in-office days are Tuesday through Thursday, but he's fine with me doing Monday through Wednesday. I like to get it out of the way sooner, and since we only have two cars between three adults (my MIL lives with us and one of the cars is hers) it works better for our schedule. Technically I also only need to be in for 50% of my time, so some days I'll head home for lunch and work remote the rest of the day. My boss' general stance is as long as it doesn't become an issue for him, he doesn't care how we handle ourselves with regards to how much were in the office.\n\nI very much preferred to work remote, but this place also has a very generous PTO policy, sick time that's separate from the PTO, other forms of leave that I may find useful, and they actually have a pension, so it's worth putting up with the in-office requirement for me. I too am generally pretty introverted, but you sort of build a tolerance for it after a bit and learn when you need to compartmentalize. I also do feel like I know more folks here than other places I started and was fully remote, which can be nice.\n\nIf anything, be thankful it's not a full five days in the office.",

        "body": "Having interviewed with them three times, the answer is an unequivocal and resounding **yes**.\n\nFirst, there is little to no communication between recruiters, much less between departments. The first time I interviewed, I got the OA from two different recruiters and the one who had actually reached out had to send the other one an email letting them know I was already working with him. It's absurd that they don't have a system to take care of these issues.\n\nSecond, they have way too many \"leadership principles,\" and they contradict each other - you can't \"dive deep\" and \"insist on the highest standards\" while also having a \"bias for action.\" Their methodology for evaluating them is also extremely flawed, as they ask a question per LP and that is the only data they use to determine how you did. I told a story in one interview about being asked to lead a technical presentation for one of the biggest banks in the world after being with the company 90 days. I then learned (shout out to my recruiter for giving me any feedback) that I scored poorly in \"earns trust.\" Yeah, okay.\n\nThird, they basically abandon the whole \"data-driven\" methodology with their myopic \"raising the bar\" principle. Who decides how good the \"average Amazonian\" is? Through what process? Twice I was told I was \"at the bar but not raising it.\" Another way to say this is that they acknowledged I was better than about half the people there but they will continue to be employed by Amazon but I'm not good enough. Never mind that one of their LPs is \"hire **and develop** the best\" - if you're not one of the best already, you're not \"raising the bar\" and they're not interested.\n\nThere are some things they do well. They leave the qualifications intentionally vague to cast a wide net, and it's not just for show; they do genuinely give interview opportunities to a lot of engineers (like me) who wouldn't get them from someone like Apple or Netflix. They move quickly compared to other big companies and usually give you a definitive answer within a month of applying. But it doesn't matter if your interview process is better at selecting for [good liars](https://www.teamblind.com/post/do-people-lie-in-amazon-leadership-principles-interview-5hsrmdkz)¬†than for good engineers.",

Negotiating is you saying \"No, I am not willing to accept your offer unless your offer is increased.\"\n\nIf that is what you intend, yes, negotiate. This is likely true only if you have other offers, or if you're willing to forego the only offer you have and you'd rather continue looking without accepting. Keep in mind you can accept *and* continue looking.\n\nI recommend against negotiating if this is your only offer.\n\nAlso worth considering:\n\nThe company may have a few candidates they are interested in, of whom you are their first pick. If aren't willing to accept the $80k but their number 2 candidate is, they may not increase their offer to land you. It depends on whether the company thinks $10k-$20k is worth their #1 vs candidate over their #2\n\nIn today's tech world, there are lots of entry level candidates and few entry level jobs. It is a buyer's market right now for new grads (you, the candidate, are selling).\n\nLastly, imo, $80k starting now vs $100k starting in 3 months is likely going to come out pretty even in the long run. Two reasons for this:\n\n1 - After 1 year, the $80k/yr earned you $80k. After waiting 3 months to land a $100k/yr job, you'll earn 9 months of the $100k/yr job with is $67k. After 2 years: it's $160k vs $166k.\n\n2 - The sooner you reach the ~2 year mark, the sooner you can look for a new job and make a very large pay increase without being seen as a job hopper, changing too quickly and having little loyalty.\n\nIt may even take longer than 3 months to land a $100k job.\n\nMy advice, accept and optionally keep interviewing.",

What things do you notice? Or maybe you aren't thinking about these things when you're browsing the internet because you don't want your experience to feel like work.\n\nThis is how I got better at form UX and really tightening up my code before review. In my casual use of the internet I come across forms all the time, and i think about how annoying ABC is because its clunky, or why XYZ is so frustrating to use because it doesn't respond how i would expect a modern form should. I take those real human feelings and use that when I code forms. \n\nA great real-life example is how annoying government web forms are because if you mess up you have to start over; how dated the UX feels and functions when you have to fill out all your HR paperwork online for a new job. How annoying and inconsistent the experience is when applying for jobs holy shit! hhahha\n\nAnd so what that translates to on the job is \"I just know how I want to feel when I use a form\" and in my effort to achieve that UX i just happen to check most if not all the acceptance criteria. I know how this feature should work because this is how I want it to work as a regular user. \n\nWhen you hyper-focus on requirements - often times you're just trying to execute that in your code, and you kinda lose sight of the overall picture",

Chances are, you're earning potential will be much higher and you will be at or approaching senior level by the time you finish.\n\nI would just keep in mind, that a career transition is a potential setback/pause of your career and earning potential. While you do have professional experience you'd likely be applying for entry level roles in the new field and it may take some time to get back where you are now. Could be a year or two, could be another 5+.\n\nI switched careers in 2022. This will be the first year I will make more than in my previous industry (sales). It took two years to get up to the same wage. For me it was worth the pay cut and then a few years making the same wage in my previous professions.",

I don‚Äôt know a single person who made it anywhere worthwhile who hasn‚Äôt felt absolutely and hopelessly lost at some point in their life. But if you sit in your own mess you‚Äôll get nowhere so don‚Äôt underestimate the power of starting small to try and figure stuff out.\n\nThird, who cares? And I don‚Äôt mean this in a condescending way. But more like, so there‚Äôs other students who do better, so there‚Äôs people ahead of you, so there are millions of calculator apps or whatever, but frankly who cares? Unless you‚Äôre trying to become a billionaire with your first app (which is a wild delusion for most folks at some point) your thought process is wrong on this. \n\nYou need to crawl, then walk, then run. Which means build the things others have made, at least you have guides. Build off of those if you want, I promise you some guy on stack overflow 9 years ago has answers for what you‚Äôre stuck on. Personal projects are about learning what you enjoy doing. To that effect who cares what others have done, if you enjoy doing it go for it. \nI promise doing what you enjoy will push you that 10-20% above based on motivation alone.\n\nFourth, just start. Whatever it is, just start. Internships, coffee chats, mock interviews, career counseling through your college. Just start. Analysis paralysis is very real. The only way past it is to make some decision even if it end up being suboptimal. You need to break the tie.\n\nFifth, discipline. I hate it, most people hate it. But the phrase ‚Äúhard work beats talent when talent doesn‚Äôt work hard‚Äù still rings true. Whatever you choose to do, stick through it. If you‚Äôre an international student I‚Äôm sure that alone comes with a fair amount of discipline. Being thousands of miles away and still doing what you‚Äôre supposed to do everyday. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you join leadership or be an IC. You need consistency and discipline to see results.\n\nLastly, I‚Äôll say is, while learning to keep going is important, learning when to pivot is even more important. Note I didn‚Äôt say quit. Pivoting is just redirecting your energy to what makes more sense for you and your interests. You have limited time and limited energy, you can‚Äôt do everything heck even Superman can‚Äôt. So you need to learn to prioritize and pivot.\n\nFor right now, rest assured that 2 years is a drop in the ocean for a potential pivot to a rewarding 40-45 year career. You‚Äôre not a lost cause, you‚Äôre just young. I promise you everyone is as confused as you are. Just start something small even if everyone has done it and stay out of your head so you can keep marching forwards with whatever pivot you choose in your life.",

It shows that you're always thinking about how you can harness CS to improve some pain point, and you take action to do so. You can start off with something really simple, since you're pretty new to the field. Maybe kind of overdone, but a pomodoro timer is an example of a potential project - someone thought, \"I wish there was a way I could time my study sessions to maximize productivity,\" and then took action and coded something up to do it. The more unique and personal this idea is to you, the better. Lastly, something important to note is that you likely won't get all the knowledge you need in your classes.

When you're a freshman it's harder, they mostly go for sophomores and juniors since they're closer to grad and thus return the company's investment quicker.\n\nIf you're a freshman now, it sets a pretty good schedule for you. If you can't get an internship, which is usually the case, you spend the first year working on projects for the resume, and then use that for internships the next two years, and try to get a return offer after grad from one of those. When you're a sophomore, set yourself a fixed (# of apps) daily goal, even if small, and start.\n\nAs for the projects themselves, I can't tell you what to make, but I'd started with a website with three.js. It was fun to write thanks to Three, it lightly dabbled in the process of hosting it etc., and it resulted in something permanent online, which imo is more satisfying than a local terminal program unless that serves a real use. Even better if you do something with even a small amount of users, so you can get started on databases.\n\nIf you want to go more hardware/embedded CS, look into making an RC with as many functional systems you can put into it. I made one last year that I remotely (from the library lmao) attended some in person courses with and had classmates charge it in the room. Very transferable to swe? Not really, realistically. But it made me get to know many people and boomed my enthusiasm, and you really need that.\n\nTLDR don't care about my experiences: For your projects I'd recommend trying to solve a real problem but realistically, people usually fail to find something like that, you just need to start with anything to fill the resume and get the habit going.",

Expand on uni projects, especially those you find interesting. You're already doing them, you can work on them further and put 'em on GitHub.\n2. Think of whatever CS topic you enjoy or think you might enjoy (gaming, data analysis, web development) and/or real-life topic (history, finance, music, medical) and make something related. Doesn't matter if it's overdone (web shop, library record keeping) or novel, do something you'll like :)\n3. Don't go too big, you'll burn yourself out.\n4. On a similar note as 3, don't worry about perfection. Make something perfectable first.\n5. Use Git with all of your projects (publishable or not), get in the habit of writing good commit messages, and push everything to GitHub (and/or GitLab, if you want). These are greay habits for later. I think only 20% of my repos are public.\n\nDon't worry about publishing a project. Play around, take tutorials, make dumb scripts, and write whatever code comes to mind. Maybe some of it will be interesting enough for you to work on it further and take public.\n\nYou can also try Advent of Code for code challenges similar to what you know (algorithms, data structures), with more flexibility than LeetCode/CodeWars. You can make your solutions public too (not the inputs!).\n\nYou're very young and have tons of time to find your niche(s), so experiment early and cheaply.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n- Try learning testing (unit testing especially) early, it's insanely useful and highly required in industry.\n- As mentioned, use Git with all of your projects.\n- Don't let LLMs like ChatGPT write for you. Especially this early, your skills will stagnate. This includes BOTH code and regular text (comments, commit messages, README files).\n- Do use ChatGPT to learn what you don't know, but also read documentation. Both are very useful skills.\n- Write a Readme for all of your projects (not right away, but over time). Markdown and documentation are both very useful in industry, and for those repositories you make public, READMEs are super important (arguably more so than the code).\n\nDon't overwork yourself into early burnout. Work on what you enjoy (and obviously your actual uni work), and if something is good enough, feel free to make it public. But until then, explore as many areas of CS as you can (embedded, low-level, programming language theory, AI (many subfields here), web development (front and back), operations/devops & Cloud (maybe a bit later), desktop applications (like your console apps), etc.).\n\nThere's no deadline for this, do it in your own time :)",

You could say something like, I think I work slower then other people in the organization because I close an average of 5 tickets each day or hour or whatever. What do you think I should be my average? Tell your manager what you do to make sure your work is done to a high standard (you double check your work before you close them or maybe you spend additional time with clients,etc). Ask your manager for feedback about your work and be willing to change. Try not to be defensive if your manager gives you honest feedback or make excuses. It can be helpful to ask for suggestions on how to improve. (Thank you for letting me know I am closing 25% less tickets then my colleagues, is there training available to me to improve my speed.)\n\nIf you have been diligent during your work day and you are not as fast as other team members, your manager should be able to explain that to you.

Why would the previous manager expect you to be awake or even wake up for his call? \n\nI never had this issue before but this time I work remotely for an APAC team and there are many cultural differences in terms of working hours etc. I  could handle it the first two years as I usually don't mind working extra hours and the people were generally nice, even though there were a lot of issues like cultural differences, no other woman in the whole department etc. Last year my ex manager got promoted so another guy took his place and I ve been reporting to this new guy. The situation is exactly like yours. Continuously moving targets to always make me feel inadequate, never praising any kind of work I do even though the previous manager and my manager 's manager were giving me very good reviews etc. \nHe is exactly like your current manager, giving no clear expectations, no clear communication and always saying that I should have thought of XYZ from the start. I don't mind feedback and I actually implement a lot of his technical feedback. It's the continuous subtle accusation about lack of professionalism, carelessness etc. there were many times that I was the only one looking at prod issues, I would resolve them, put a summary in public channels of what was the issue and how i resolved it, and then instead of getting a \" good job for figuring this out\", I would have to explain to him why did it take me 2 hours to resolve for example instead of 1. \nBut what REALLY pisses me off is that he doesn't practice what he preaches about professionalism. He will release stuff without testing, release stuff without updating the database to be on the same version etc. But no one tells him anything because the rest of them are nice people. \n\n\nAnyway there is not much we can do. I actually did go to my previous manager and asked him if I could report back to him. I didn't go into details about my current manager though, I tried to avoid all the extra drama. I just want to get out of this situation. He said yes and he would request for the change. So I guess it helped having someone higher up that I had worked with in the past and he knows me already. \n\nBut it's been a few weeks and nothing has happened. Maybe he didn't think it was urgent. I think we are hiring now and he might want to give him new direct reports from the new hire before changing me back to him, I don't know. \nI will ask again and probably this time I will be more specific about what the issue is, because I can't keep asking without giving concrete reasons. \nIt's hard though to do it without making yourself looking like the one who is just complaining or the problematic one. \nSo I am also looking for a new job, but the job market sucks. \nI think though we don't really have a choice, just have to keep looking. \nGood luck, I hope you find a better manager or a better job üôèüèªüôèüèª let us know how it goes.",

November gives you time to settle in Tampa, address health concerns, and approach job searching from a position of stability rather than desperation. The fact that you're planning to work at Costco shows responsibility and work ethic that many employers respect.\n\nUse this transition period strategically for skill updates that align with Florida's tech market. A service like Applyre can help you passively explore opportunities while you're getting settled. Focus on companies that value government experience or have contracts requiring security clearances, as your USDA background could be an asset.\n\nDon't abandon programming over temporary market conditions. Your 3-4 years of experience puts you past the entry-level hurdle, and relocating to a major metro area like Tampa actually improves your prospects significantly. The market will recover, and having that Costco gap shows you're practical about supporting yourself during transitions.",

I intended to be a programmer when I first enrolled in CS back in 2019, but after my freshman year I realized that coding for a living wasn't for me- just as a hobby. I stayed in school because I was more than halfway done with my bachelor's and I didn't want all of that money to go to waste. In my junior year, I applied to an IT internship and I ended up getting it. I continued to work in IT for 2 years, got my bachelors (with my minor being in IT), and now I'm a Network Engineer making $60,000. Even before I got promoted to engineer, I got offers to do tech sales and even got to do some traveling for it. I would've not gotten those opportunities if my anticipated degree wasn't listed in my resume.\n\nHowever, someone else's experience may be different from mine- maybe they've worked unpaid internships and now they can't get hired anywhere. I don't want to invalidate anyone's experiences, but please understand that there's a whole set of variables that impact the job market for everyone- as it is different in every city, and country especially. Maybe if you're only concerned about job outlook, compare CS' outlook with ME/Aero and see which is better.

And you worked on the same embedded stuff twice, which means you have a considerable amount of time spent.  Even if it felt like you were relearning everything the second time, I can almost guarantee you that you were picking it up way faster than someone green.  And that you still have a lot of latent knowledge in the area.\n\nI would try and rebrand yourself as a yocto embedded guy, with a bunch of extra nice to haves -- Rust, etc.  Also try applying to different sized companies.  Startups love guys who have a ton of different experience in different domains.  Some really large (non-elite) companies, have less strict requirements because you'll be doing exactly on thing over and over, etc.  The market sucks, the market is a statistical analysis that really doesn't represent any one person's experience.\n\nAlso, (and it's no one's business but yours) but it seems like you have a lot going on outside of work being the only bread winner, only driver, doing all the chores, etc.  It may be that the stress of whatever you have going on at home is bleeding into your career anxieties.  It might be worth trying to find a solution/compromise to one or more of those problems to see if it helps with workday pressures as a side effect.  Something to think about as your managing everything.\n\nGood luck!  Not sure if any of my advice was that practical, but hopefully something in there helped.",

Maybe the goals aren't to get to \"the next levels\", but you'll need to have goals nevertheless. Doesn't mean they need to force you to write 15 SMART goals with metrics and everything, but still.\n\nCompanies that do career ladders well will have a concept of \"career role\" or \"terminal\" role. That's the place you need to get to if you want to stay there forever. At most companies that do this, that's a mid to high senior level.\n\nThat means that until you are at that mid to high senior, a part of your job is to get better until you are. That means goals and progress. If you don't want to do that, you're out.\n\nOnce you get to the terminal level, things get a bit more nuanced. You no longer need to work toward your next promotion. You can say \"I'll be a senior my entire life\". If you're ok with that and won't complain if all you get are cost of living adjustments, and never get to Staff/Principal, that's fine. But you still need to have goals and move forward. \n\nWhy? Skill inflation. Someone who was a high senior in 2010 isn't the same as someone in 2020. The world changes, technologies change, there's more resources, like AI. So the bar is continually raising. To stay at the same \"level\" as everyone else relatively, you have to keep growing, else you're going backward. That's why there's some level of age discrimination: when you're young you're kind of at the bar by default because you didn't have time to regress. But as you get older, if you don't keep up, you fall behind. And a lot of people do.\n\nThe goals you set are there to make sure you stay at the bar. As a mid to high senior your job is more than just taking a ticket and executing, too. You'll be tasked with doing project work, collaboration, etc, and those become goals too, in addition to learning, coaching, and various other responsibilities at that level.\n\nBut if you want to come in at work, look at Jira/Linear, pick the ticket at the top of the queue, write the code, open a pull request, pick the next ticket, and repeat until its time to go home... I'm sorry to say, but fewer and fewer companies are willing to pay for that. Many never did.",

Maybe you‚Äôre not answering as well as you think.¬†\n\nBut you‚Äôre still getting interviews in this market. That‚Äôs a good sign!",

Sit you down, give you a relatively simple application that is representative of the type of work they'd actually do to create, and have at it.  Google and use whatever you want.  Whether it works or not, you can at least see their coding style and see how far they get if you are giving them a finite amount of time.\n\nSure it takes time, but forgo all the other BS and just do that.

That's why it's called a \"job search\", you're searching for the right job.\n\nIf you're barely getting interviews at all, and this startup was your 1 and only opportunity you've had in months, you'd be crazy to turn it down.\n\nIt all comes down to how you're doing in your job search. There are people out there who have done hundreds of applications over the course of several months who would die for that chance. But there's also people out there that are getting interviews just fine that probably wouldn't bother.\n\nOne thing I will add is don't make up your mind from online reviews. Always make up your mind based on first-hand evidence after talking with your hiring manager, and some SWE's you'd be working with. The reverse interview is the most important part of the interview.\n\nYou never know, maybe the vibes you get from this startup are completely different once you actually talk to them. Things constantly change, especially in the startup world, and places like Glassdoor tend to attract people that have things to complain about so it always skews negative.\n\nOne startup I was interviewing had a bunch of negative reviews saying it was a boys club, and if you weren't buddy buddy with the CEO you would never get good raises or promotions. When I actually spoke with people at the company, thats not the vibe I got at all, so I joined despite those reviews. I'm extremely glad I did. I bet those reviews were just from salty employees bad at their job, because I'm the last person to be \"buddy buddy\" with anyone at work, especially the CEO, but I got amazing raises and several promotions. I've had 2 of the biggest raises of my career at that company.\n\nSo I'd encourage you at least humor it, and walk into it with good intentions. If when you speak to these people its as terrible as what you've read say, *then* you can reject them.",

Unfortunately due to the time constraint, it's like a competition. You have to figure out how to make a MVP in a short time, and be able to explain how you would do more given more time. Making it work and covering general edgecadds and showing awareness of stuff you can't cover in 15-30 mins is probably what would of improved my odds.¬†\n\n\nI practiced this by doing LC easies and timing myself for 10 mins.\n\n\nFor the other code stuff.

You didn't do bad, its just the unfortunate need to filter down the candidates. And generally that's because interviewing is a costly process for companies. \n\nBut, it's not always the case that you get filtered out after that call - but generally the sign I look for from the recruiter is they'll go into: telling you about the interview process, and telling you that their scheduling assistant will be emailing you to get your interview availability\n\nI've had good calls that I just don't understand what might have went wrong, and what I've picked up on is when the recruiter goes into that spiel, then I've def made it to the first technical, I can relax. That wasn't the case when I was interviewing Jan 2023.\n\nOne thing I adjusted in my phone screen approach with the recuiter is I try not to go into deep or prolonged detail which sorta invites them in and gives space for an actual normal convo. They have your resume in front of them anyway so you dont' need to go deep into it, and in fact, letting them prompt you for that info is good. But other than that, I think you're doing the right preparation - and if anything I don't think this call requires any rehearsed or extensive preparation. \n\nMy goal is usually to aim for a casual convo. You can feel it when what they are saying is rehearsed, and so I try to see if I can wiggle the convo out of that mode. I don't really have a good way of explaining it but I just make it like I'm chatting normally with someone.",

If so, you‚Äôll need to honestly explore your thinking behind that expectation and adjust accordingly. ‚ÄúExpectations are premeditated resentments‚Äù - this applies to your career, job, education, professional relationships, everything. If you go into it determined to get something specific out of it, you‚Äôre probably going to be disappointed. But if you go into it knowing more about what challenges you are likely to face (exposed by the discouraging articles and posts), you‚Äôll be able to spend more time preparing to face them instead of just trying to hit arbitrary benchmarks you think should get you a job (such as leetcode grinding for x hours every day/week, knowing certain languages/frameworks, which degree you get, etc)\n\nModal of the story - do you WANT to pursue this career path? If it was as ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to do as any other job you‚Äôre already qualified for, and paid at least a living wage, would you still want to do it? If the answer is yes, start thinking about the scary stories and predictions as clickbait and YOU DO YOU BOO",

Nobody likes being used.\n\nIn reality, a \"network\" is made up of your genuine friends, family, and colleagues. That's it. Not strangers you message on LinkedIn to try and milk them for a job, not randos you run into at a meetup and aggressively shake hands and exchange business cards, not some random redditor you DM'd.\n\nYour friends, family, and colleagues.\n\nSo \"networking\" as a verb, means expanding one of those 3 categories. Colleagues is only really expanded by actually working, or going to school.... so that's a tough one to grow. Family we're stuck with. But friends can be expanded.\n\nMeetups are a common suggestion here not because they're job factories, but rather because if you go to an event with a bunch of people all interested in similar things (tech, rock climbing, playing cards, drinking, what have you), *you make friends*.\n\nSo maybe that's not the answer you wanted... but it's the answer. If you want to network, you need to make *genuine* connections. Not connections where the entire reason you're talking to them is to milk them for a job. How would you feel if you had a job, and the one and only reason someone was talking to *you* was to milk *you*?",

Not connections where the entire reason you're talking to them is to milk them for a job.\n\nThis goes the other way too, for agency recruiters. I cannot tell you how many times, pre-COVID, I'd get a call from a new agency recruiter (always the same agency; it was a revolving door) and their corporate-standard script was \"just calling to do some networking with you about...\" **No**. That's not how you do it and that's partly why your call went right to voicemail. We've never met before and you don't even understand what my job is, and you're not interested in learning about me or what I do. I gave you my elevator pitch and your response was \"hmmmm...yeah, I don't have anything that's anywhere near that right now, but let's keep in touch\" - but I know you won't. I was a keyword hit on a search and you're padding your KPIs, that's all the call is. And you're trying to figure out what keywords to use so you can get a hit off a job posting database where you can throw me in as a candidate, ignoring my salary expectations. Not that it matters anyway, because your approach is going to bear no fruit, you'll wash out in a year, and the next batter will step into the box to take another swing (and miss).\n\nAnd this is why I removed all LinkedIn connections to 3rd-party recruiters 6+ years ago, and don't accept connections from new ones. Because \"connections\" are not Pokemon, you should not try to collect them all.",

That is if you are lucky enough to find a company that would take you for a non-scrum master role. \n\nYou are better off going the technical program manager route or directly into management. Or stay in engineering and move up to gain enough skill to work cross team and deliver really large impactful projects. At that point it's far easier to jump to any of the other roles.",
