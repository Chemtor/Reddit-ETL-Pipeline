It doesn't seem necessary to mention in an  ML stack, I only use it to refine a model and that's about it unless I am missing something. Jupyter Hub too, you don't need it, it's just a collaboration tool and not sure why it would be recommended to use. Jupyter notebooks yes, but Jupyter Hub? MLFlow makes sense, orchestration is important, and I have never use Feast but I feel this section doesn't tell me what I want to know in this context. You list different AI models, which is also a bit awkward considering how much they change, but why not list ML models like Tensorflow Keras or XGBoost/Catboost? \n\nTo be even more honest, I don't think your audience will get past the first row of tools. If somebody is looking at this to learn, they'll stop there because why bother with the other tools when AI and vibe coding can do it all?",

In this release, Sail preserves compatibility with Spark‚Äôs pre-existing interface while replacing its internals with a Rust-native execution engine, delivering significantly improved performance, resource efficiency, and runtime stability.\n\nAmong other advancements, Sail 0.3 adds support for Spark 4.0 while maintaining compatibility with Spark 3.5 and improves how Sail adapts to version changes in Spark‚Äôs behavior across versions. This means you can run Sail with the latest Spark features or keep your current production environment with confidence, knowing it‚Äôs built for long-term reliability and evolution alongside Spark.\n\n[https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/)\n\n# What is Sail?\n\nSail is an open-source computation framework that serves as a drop-in replacement for Apache Spark (SQL and DataFrame API) in both single-host and distributed settings. Built in Rust, Sail runs \\~4x faster than Spark while reducing hardware costs by 94%.\n\n# What‚Äôs New in Sail 0.3\n\n* **Compatibility**¬†with Spark 4.0‚Äôs new¬†`pyspark-client`, a lightweight Python-only client with no JARs, enabling faster integration and unlocking performance and cost efficiency.\n* **Changes in the installation command**¬†now require explicitly installing the full PySpark 4.0 library (along with Spark Connect support) or the thin PySpark 4.0 client, offering greater flexibility and control, especially as Spark Connect adoption grows and variants of the client emerge.\n* **Automatic detection of PySpark version**¬†in the Python environment adjusts Sail‚Äôs runtime behavior accordingly to handle internal changes, such as differences in UDF and UDTF serialization between Spark versions, ensuring that a single Sail library remains compatible across both versions.\n* **Automatic Python unit testing**¬†on every pull request across Spark 3.5 and Spark 4.0 to track feature parity and avoid regressions.\n* **Faster object store performance,**¬†reducing latency and improving throughput across cloud-native storage.\n* **New and improved documentation**¬†with updated getting-started guides, architecture diagrams, and compatibility to help you get up and running with Sail and understand its parity with Spark.\n\n# Our Mission\n\nAt LakeSail, our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads, empowering users to handle modern data challenges with unprecedented speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. By integrating diverse workloads into a single framework, we enable the flexibility and scalability required to drive innovation and meet the demands of AI's global evolution.\n\n# Join the Slack Community\n\nThis release features contributions from several first-time contributors! We invite you to¬†[join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free)¬†and engage with the project on¬†[GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail). Whether you're just getting started with Sail, interested in contributing, or already running workloads, this is your space to learn, share knowledge, and help shape the future of distributed computing. We would love to connect with you!",

We started with accounting data, because it was the cleanest and slowly migrated the data silos into centralized database. If we met any resistance, we told them that if they wanted their data reflected in the monthly report, it had to come from the centralized database. Since the report was highly visible, they had to agree and after some initial growing pains (mostly historical data cleanup and arguments about what to name things), the automation and built in error-checking won people over.¬†\n\n\nI've worked with a lot of organizations since then and most of them don't have the demand or the inter-departmental communication necessary to break down data silos. It sounds good in theory but if the marketing team only cares about marketing data and doesn't mind getting financial data a month late, then why go throught the considerable time and effort to build a third system to combine marketing and financial data? Especially if after the system is created, you have train people on how to use it, how to keep the data clean, and how to maintain the 3rd system.¬†",

I could do the fixes on the client-side and call it **backfill-dguid**, so the user is aware they are back-filling the field.\n\n**Edit:** For the DGUID I want to experiment with linking to Overture Maps, as they have boundaries on places/divisions. They have something called GERS \\[4\\] that I can link to, that is a stable ID throughout time. Look at the interactive table that I sent you, there's tons of data from outside of Canada, they just have no idea how to link it to statcan data.

Write Terraform to setup an EC2, install postgres and all the good stuff like IAM, etc, all the stuff you're gonna use. I suggest the basic AWS course by Adrian Cantril. You should work in your local desktop but connecting to an Ubuntu EC2 instance.\n\n* Set up a project for Python with uv, ruff, mypy, pydantic, all that stuff.\n\n* Write some code to download data from somewhere. Something like the NY taxi data is fine\n\n* Upload it to postgres in EC2, and Snowflake\n\n* Do some modeling and transformations with DBT, both postgres and snowflake\n\n* Orchestrate with Airflow\n\n* Package it in Docker and make sure it's easy to use and install and run everything from scratch with a few simple commands\n\n* Use Power BI or whatever to build a report\n\nThat's enough work for a month or more, mostly reasearching, reading documentation, and understanding how things work and get tied together. Then you can apply for any role.

I personally like Docker even though more for DevOps but it‚Äôs great to know also maybe a little bit of Linux. Writing docker files/yml is good to know don‚Äôt need to be an expert at every single thing again knowing the basics and when to use should suffice. Yes orchestration like airflow and some knowledge of APIs. I believe you don‚Äôt have to be the super expert but knowing how these applications/services work would be a great benefit. Try to avoid buzzwords, HR/recruiter and new shiny tools every 5 mins there‚Äôs always going to be something new. Focus on your fundamentals and add databricks DBT? something solid be open and honest and think about what‚Äôs useful? Why is it useful for this scenario etc. lastly a visualization tool Tableau/Looker etc. Good luck you got this.",

Both of them offer a free account for testing with limitations (Databricks daily limit, Snowflake also limited 30 day trial but you can create a new account later). Databricks notebook / compute environment is very similar to Fabric so that's what I'd recommend.\n\nAlso pandas isn't really appropriate for any of these environments as it not parallel compute optimised (the whole code ends up running on the driver node). You may end up working with some code some data scientist wrote in pandas but you likely shouldn't be writing it from scratch (although pyspark does have pandas api on spark which is mostly cross compatiable). All of these platforms have a variant of SQL and I've found data teams who migrate from on-prem to cloud tend to prefer using it as they're not as comfortable with python, but you could also familiarise yourself with pyspark which will be relevant for both Databricks and Fabric.\n\nFor loading data, I would get comfortable with e.g. using spark.read() for either append, overwrite or merge. Beyond reading CSV, look at reading/writing parquet and look at processing e.g. JSON files and handling semi-structured data operations (e.g. exploding on list elements) as you will often need to ingest from APIs with this structure and then flatten it for a reporting requirement.\n\nI would also familairise yourself with data platform design patterns, e.g. Databricks medallion architecture. In practice companies will implement it in different ways but it's worth getting comfortable with teminology and how it's generally applied:\n\nhttps://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture",

There are few reasons to compare raw data between media files.  You almost always want to extract features or outputs with AI/ML and then do the comparison.  AI/ML over media files is almost always highly parallelized specialized GPU-based compute.  That's expensive.  It makes sense to save the outputs or cache it.  Even retrieving the color would be cheaper to write out as an: image_url, color then re-compute on the fly.  This type of compute is very different from traditional database model of: retrieve off file system via index, store in memory and then compute over a set.  It assumes quick computation over a large set of small things.  Media files tend to be large.  They take up too much space in memory.  They can easily blow up a hard drive.  So it makes sense to store them on disk or blob storage.  It makes life a lot less complicated.",

Indexed Views, Filtered Indexes, and Partitioning are some other out-of-the-box features that can help you with performance and data management as well.\n\nI say this as someone who ran OLTP and OLAP against the same SQL Server databases, that had tables which individually had 10s of billions of rows and multi-terabytes of data, on minimally provisioned hardware (8 GB of Memory and 4 CPUs), and most queries ran in sub-second time.",

        "body": "There's a lot of good questions here to unpack. I work in this area, so I can give you an overview.\n\n**What is real time? Is near-real time enough? (tldr; question)**\n\nThis is defined differently for different use cases and there isn't one definition for this. \n\nFor example, the definition of real-time is different for real-time operating systems (think RTOS) or high-freuquency trading (they literally measure cable lengths to minimize propagation delays) and other use cases. For data engineering, \"real-time\" rarely means milliseconds in my experience, but is very often seconds and even minutes, depending who in the org-chart you talk to. \n\nThat said, a lot of large-scale compute workloads we see often do end up in the milliseconds. The most common place I see those is in the security space, but their setups don't resemble a typical data engineering environment. Instead of CDC, Kafka, warehouses and ETL jobs, you will see transactional workloads, APIs, and processes directly talking to one another over HTTP.\n\n**Complex transformations (2)**\n\nIt's historically been pretty hard to pull off but that's changing. The foundational work/papers to do this at scale is fairly recent (I'd say, last 2-3 years), so it's not surprising you haven't seen off-the-shelf solutions here that live up to the promises.\n\nFundamentally, to compute in real-time, you need to be able to compute \"incrementally\". That is, update views over your data in real-time by only observing how the input tables \"change\" (inserts/updates/deletes). No batch engine (like the ones you mention, Trino, Spark etc) can achieve this, because they are designed from the ground up to recompute queries from scratch, which gets slower as the data size increases.\n\nFor an actual incremental engine, I encourage you to give [Feldera](https://github.com/feldera/feldera) a spin (disclaimer: I work there). It let's you define pipelines as tables and deeply nested views in SQL. When the tables \"change\" (get inserts/updates/deletes), the views are updated incrementally. The guarantee is that the amount of work a pipeline does is proportional to the size of the changes, not the size of the overall data. It's main strength is that it can do such incremental evaluation for **arbitrarily complex SQL, including recursion**, not just simple queries (as you seem to have noted about alternatives).\n\nWhat this means is that pipelines do so little work per event, that it routinely hits the millisecond timescales in real-world workloads (users have even reported 4ms latencies to keep views over terabytes of data, with low tens of milliseconds being more common). Of course, it depends on the queries, the arrival rates and what not. But we do see users run some beastly pipelines that update at sub-second speeds over billions of rows (think 10K line Spark SQL code, with 100s of joins, distincts, aggregates, and what not).\n\n**Infra bottlenecks and processing delays (1, 3)**\n\nYou are spot on here, but not due to actual hardware issues (modern hardware is ridiculously fast and if anything, most software and cloud infra sucks at taking advantage of them). NVMe storage and modern CPUs can pack quite the punch.\n\nWhen it comes to building real-time systems **end-to-end** however, you might still end up in the seconds to minutes range, even if the analytics/compute side is instanteous. This is because most data stores and plumbing infra aren't built for high volume real-time ingest (i.e., they cannot handle inserts/updates/deletes to data).\n\nFor example, if further downstream of Feldera, you want to serve the results off of something like Delta Lake, you have to incur the additional latency from having to run Delta Table merges before you can serve this data. We have (painfully) seen pipelines update complex views in milliseconds only for things like Delta Lake and Kafka to add another minute afterwards. There are of course ways to architect around it, but it does take a lot of custom systems work (see the security industry context I mentioned earlier).\n\n**Hype vs reality (5)**\n\nThere is a tremendous amount of hype and marketing here. Don't believe any vendor (including me :)) -- reality about this space is that it is quite nascent, and whether you can hit the right operating points around scale/latency/throughput does depend on your workload and the laws of computational complexity at play. Throw your worst queries and most challenging use cases at them before you make a decision, rather than believe any hype.",

        "body": "First, OP, your post reads like a marketing flyer with all the buzzwords. There are definite good practices for many needs but not a generic one size fits all. There are a list of things I would suggest,\n\n1. Stop calling it medallion architecture (it is a pet peeve of mine). The three tier design has been around for 35+ years. It was originally called staging, core and semantic layers. There are very few hard and fast rules around them; just generic guidelines.\n2. The best datawarehouses don't have any particular purpose (at least not until you hit the semantic layer). This is especially true of the core layer. It should be modeled around the business processes. As such, it only changes as often as the business does. Normally, this is not very often.\n3. Things happen in the processes between layers. It is not very often that things happen inside a layer.\n4. Staging is for landing data and, if desired, keeping the historical feed data. You should always have the original feed from the operational system so that you can trace your data back to it. The data warehouse is considered \"correct\" when it balances back to the system of record (SOR). If the SOR isn't right, you don't fix it in the DW, you fix it in the SOR and let the correction flow forward. When you change source data in the DW, you lose your chain of accountability. The Line of Businesses (LOB) or legal will tell you how long they want you to archive that stuff. Remember, they look at it differently than IT.\n5. The core layer is where data is kept that has been cleaned and adjusted to standard values. Different LOBs may have different abbreviations and meanings for data components. The processes to create and update the core data is where you adjust those to the standards. I tend to make my core layer in 3NF because it shows the proper relationships between the data parts without assigning specific purpose to the data. You make it fit for all purposes. This is where you also clean up things like addresses. (These can be a nightmare. Look at all of the ways Peachtree is used in Atlanta.) You also generalize things like customers, employees, vendors, etc. to generic terms like Party. You don't have to have the entire core flushed out before you use it. Just have the design as far as you can and flush the data out as project come along to fund it.\n6. The third layer, semantic, is where you put your data products, created from core, that the various LOBs need. When you create something like a star schema, you assign specific purpose to the data. It may or may not fit with other LOBs in the organization. Trying to reuse data products across various LOBs can be a tricky proposition and needs a bit of thought.\n7. Traditionally, you would only give access for users at the semantic layer. I tend to break this guideline. While still having appropriate security controls, I give users access to any layer they want. Data Scientists tend to like data a early and close to the operational data source as possible. I give them access to staging with the caveat to them the data is still abit of a mess. Regulatory reporting normally can wait a bit for the much cleaner data in the semantic layer. Those are just two examples.\n8. Don't ignore the other data parts like security, metadata, governance, etc. This is why you want to find an experience data architect to help you. Not a senior data engineer. They are not the same thing.",

I avoid fortune telling in this layer - guessing what people will need and want in the future is pointless in the places I have worked, it instead reflects the analytics and trending that has been asked for. As a \"rule of thumb\" if you are making a report in Excel or desktop BI tools for occasional viewing, its built direct from silver. If you are publishing to a BI server, using weekly, daily or intra-day, the tables needed for BI displays are modelled, added to the catalog & published to this layer for the BI tool to pull from.",

The writer isn't *technically* wrong about any given point, it is just that their points completely whiff on what actually matters in the domain.\n\nThe writer is essentially bitching that Iceberg doesn't make for a good transactional database.\n\nWell *duh*\n\nI'll pick a couple parts...\n\n> Storing metadata this way makes it a lot larger than necessary. \n\nThe size of these files is utterly insignificant. Iceberg is designed for, as stated later, \"tens of petabytes of data\" and a few dozen bytes per write is utterly inconsequential. It is less than a rounding error. You may as well be complaining about the unnecessary weight of a heavy duty door on a mining truck - half a kilo isn't going to matter when you're carting 5 tons around.\n\nSo, from a *purely technical* perspective, yes it has a *slight* amount of redundant data, but in practice the difference wouldn't even be measurable.\n\n> \"Tables grow large by being written to, they grow really large by being written to frequently\"\n\nThis relates to a complaint about optimistic concurrency, and again it completely whiffs. I don't know where they got that quote from, but it doesn't inherently apply to the types of uses that iceberg would be used for. Each operation is for updating or inserting millions and billions of rows. We're not expecting to do *frequent* writes into iceberg, we're expecting to do *big* ones.\n\nHe follows up with...\n\n> Did I mention that 1000 commits/sec is a pathetic number if you are appending rows to table?\n\n... and if you'll excuse my language: Who *the fuck* is doing 1000 commits/sec for a use case where iceberg is even remotely relevant, that is completely fucking insane. You're not using iceberg for subsecond latency use cases, so just add 1 second of latency to the process and batch the writes, good god.\n\n> you need to support cross table transactions.\n\nNo, you don't *need* to, because the use case doesn't call for it. This isn't a transactional database where you need to commit a correlated update/insert to two tables at the same time to maintain operational consistency because this isn't the transactional store underpinning an application state as a system of record. Data warehouses can be altered and rebuilt as needed, and various constraints can be, and are, skipped to enable high throughput performance.\n\nIf you're ingesting customer data, account data, and a linking table of the two, you don't need a transaction to wrap all of that because you use your orchestrator to run the downstream pipelines dependent on the two after they've both updated.\n\n> This is extra problematic if you have a workload where you constantly trickle data into the Data Lake. ... For example, let us say you micro batch 10000 rows every second and that you have 100 clients doing that.\n\nWhy write every second? Why not batch writes up every minute? Why have each node do a separate metadata write, rather than having them write their raw data, then do a single metadata transaction for them? Why use Iceberg streaming inputs like this at all, when you can just dump to parquet -- it isn't like you're going to be doing updates at that speed, you can just do blind appends, and that means you don't strictly need versions.\n\nThe writer is just inventing problems by applying Iceberg to things you shouldn't apply it to. It doesn't wash the dishes either, but who cares that's not what it is for.\n\n> I am going to be generous and assume you only do this 12 hours per day. \n\nShould read as: I'm going to be a complete idiot and make the worst decision possible.\n\n---\n\nI'm done with this article, it is garbage, throw it away.",

Sometimes it is deemed useful enough to be shared, and then outside people will more or less abusively reuse them without the context for which they were made: not everyone work with FAANG-scale data warehouses. At the same time, those outsides usually don't have the possibility to rebuild tools from scratch to make them more refined than the original, like Duck Lake is doing.

This data could come from a Kafka queue or perhaps some web servers streaming in logs. This is a very common workload and the kind of pattern you need for big data and Data Lakes to make sense in the first place (if not, why didn't you just run a single PostgreSQL on a small EC2 instance?).\n\nTo be honest a lot of people have 'data lakehouses' that could be run out of traditional rdbms or clickhouse on a big server and the reason for that is fashion, but it does make a lot of these issues he mentions not ones that will come up for most practitioners, in the same way that people can rightly criticize transaction wraparound in postgresql but most people will never have 4 billion unvacuumed transactions to know it's even a thing.

Rewrite the data into a single dataset partitioned by ticker and day (or month) and either load it into BigQuery or convert it to Iceberg on GCS so you can do predicate pushdown. BigQuery will compact and index the columns for you, then the BigQuery Storage API streams only the rows you filter, so a GPU training job gets data at disk speed while you still pay object-storage rates underneath. If you need key-value style lookups, Bigtable works well: write one row per ticker-timestamp, keep the raw features in a wide column family, and you‚Äôll hit single-digit-millisecond latency. I‚Äôve used BigQuery, Bigtable, and DreamFactory together-DreamFactory just sits in front of the datastore and gives my training service a clean REST endpoint that pulls only the needed columns for each mini-batch. This mix usually drops load times from minutes to seconds.",

It's also not useful if the user wants frequent updates of the data during the day.\n\nWhenever running into performance issues, the first step is to analyze queries plans and optimize by indexing, partitioning etc. Another issue is typically that many visualization tools pull in everything at the lowest grain level (individual transactions) while 90% of the visuals only need aggregated data. So then create aggregates on the db and use these instead.

I don't really recommend it for most use cases. \n\nConnections and editing in Grafana is a simpler experience but it has its own annoying quirks (the plotting UX is underwhelming and has weird data transform abstractions that I find myself fighting with rather than enjoying) and it's generally not as flexible as I would like it to be. I don't use any of the advanced alerting features. I'd like to, but I haven't figured them out yet. My favorite part of Grafana is the units and formatting support, it really is nice and convenient. It's not great, but it's better than superset.\n\nNiFi gets a lot of hate, but I am a firm believer in \"there's a time and place for every tool\". The time and place that NiFi was developed for was the NSA. A lot of the stuff that it was good at was classified and got dropped when it was published. Now, Nifi is good for moving data around from point to point, not data transformations. You'll want something else for more advanced data transformation, such as something with real scripting language support (nifi's code editor sucks ass. Basic user interface tasks are also hidden behind different context menus and it's a pain to use, generally. The JOLT processor advanced interface is pretty good though). It is however an okay tool for setting up long-running batch processing jobs from your database to something else where you want to have visual feedback. I set up a number of web scraping flows with it (not really a good use case) and I'm looking to migrate to something that sucks less.\n\nDagster and Airflow are the NiFi alternatives you'll want to consider.

They are just a way to easily develop serverless functions in Fabric that can be integrated in Power BI reports, taking user selections and entries as input. \n\nWhat they CAN do is update a SQL database such as those you can create in Fabric (if enabled) which Power BI can connect to using direct query mode. They can also update a CRM through its API endpoints, but that's not too different from doing so in any other CRUD apps, and your average analyst won't have the necessary permissions nor skill to handle authentication to use those endpoints.\n\nIn a larger context, the unmet need this feature is trying to solve is a common one: analysts often get asked if they can add some kind of write-back to their reports, such as documenting decisions, comments, events. If you end up working somewhere that has such a need and that extensively uses Power BI and Fabric, using these can be a great quick solution for enforcing clean data entry without having to build a full CRUD app, and it clearly beats using spreadsheets with no data validation for inputs.",

I would be curious to hear more about your background, maybe getting a read on whether or not your profile/skillset is up-to-date would give you a more accurate place to start. \n\nIf your skillset isn't 'up-to-date', I would suggest professional certifications, and see if your current position will allow you *any kind* of exposure that would make the statement \"yeah I've used <some\\_tool> for a short time in my current job\" true. Even the introductory level certifications for some of these skills/tools on your resume would go a really long way. We all know you do a lot of learning on the job, you just need something on paper to reassure them you can learn what you need to learn.\n\nIf your skillset *is* up-to-date, and you have done as much as you can with the feedback you've gotten, keep hurling applications. If you're at this point you know that it is more 'right place right time' type of game so the best thing you can do is give yourself the most chances possible (i.e. most applications possible). Personally I've had the most success and always recommend any actual professional connections you might have. Knowing someone, even if they are in an unrelated role at a company you're applying for goes a looong way.\n\nLastly, if you're at \\^ this point \\^, relax, chill out, learn on the clock, live life.

Follow up with a dbt rewrite; the model tests catch bad assumptions you didn‚Äôt realise you made. Drill the planner-explain analyze will teach you more about skew than any blog post. When stuck, screenshot the plan and compare it to the Spark DAG; patterns start to click. Keep a scratch sheet of oddball functions (lateral, array\\_agg, conditional windows) and fold one into every practice query so it sticks. I‚Äôve used Airflow for scheduling and Snowflake for isolated perf tests, but DreamFactory let me spin out quick REST endpoints from the same tables to demo downstream consumers.

Startups are tricky to get into and until you have been working for a bit, it‚Äôs hard to know the right questions to ask to avoid coming in too early.\n\nRegarding what you should do next, I would advise against freelancing. Most companies don‚Äôt want to hire freelancers with 10 years of experience as they can simply go with a boutique consulting company. I‚Äôm not saying it is impossible, but it is a steep hill to climb and it also sounds like you could benefit working in a team environment and learning from more experienced engineers.\n\nThe top 4 things that will help get the average data engineering job are the following (in this order):\n\n1. SQL\n2. Python\n3. Shell scripting (aka bash)\n4. Data modeling (i.e. fact and dimensional modeling)\n\nOnce you get a good grasp of these, then you layer on whatever are the current popular tech stack tools/platforms like the following (no order):\n\n1. Clouding computing (AWS/Azure) - sounds like you are already good here.\n2. dbt \n3. Snowflake/Databricks\n4. Orchestration (Airflow or Dagster)\n5. Extract Load tools (dltHub, Airbyte, etc.)\n\nThese are going to be your most common tools. While there are things like Spark, Trino, Kafka, etc., not all companies use them so there is limited value in focusing on them.\n\nNext, I‚Äôd also pick up good software development tools like:\n\n1. Docker\n2. source control (GitHub)\n3. CI/CD (GitHub Actions)\n4. Infrastructure as Code (i.e. terraform)\n\nThis is quite a bit and I suggest starting at the top of my post and slowly working down. Next, while you can apply to jobs, the entry job market is very strained right now. You need to start networking, ideally in person but if that isn‚Äôt feasible then you need to seek out online networking.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions.",

It might not look that way when you are still learning the very basics of coding but if you just build a couple good projects theres no way you wont nail them. Then its a matter of learning how to handle an interview.",

Do expand your toolset over time and if you can, but do not focus on the tool as such. Instead focus on solving the problem at hand with the tool(s) available, as effectively and efficiently as possible. Also keep in mind someone else will eventually pick up where you left off, so document what you've done in an accessible way.\n\n3) know and paint the bigger picture for yourself and others to understand more easily what is going on. This helps you to do a better job and explain what you are doing, but it also helps others to understand and match their skills to the task at hand. \n\nIf you focus on these 3 abilities, you can work in any company of any size. Your experience in some tools, like Databricks, counts of course, yet less so because you know the tool technically, more so because you know how to apply it to the above 3 abilities. Every new tool is just a means to and end. If you can master 1 tool, you can master another one, and another one after that.\n\nTrust yourself. You'll find the right opportunity. Hope this helps.",

This can cause a lot of contention, blocking/locking. But if you're just running daily loads outside of business hours, or deltas are small/can be picked out, it's probably okay.\n* Retaining history. Some LoB systems do this themselves, some don't - for the latter, you need a separate data respository if you want to retain historic changes\n* Not having to do data modelling/transformation in BI tools\n  * Mitigating lock-in\n  * Making better modelling/transformation tools available\n* Having a relatively open data source - you can plug in whatever you like, not just a single BI tools\n  * (though PBI, at least, allows models to be queried, it's not great)",

        "body": "> do modern BI systems need an analytics Database\n\nTechnically no, in practice yes. \n\n\nThe reason is that productive systems like ERP are built for recording transaction data, i.e. a fine-grained log of events and facts. Technically this translates into lots of short-lived requests to the system, e.g. \"store this order\", \"lookup this invoice\" etc. That is, the system load per request is low. \n\n\n\nThis is different for analysis oriented queries, where we typically want to show aggregate results, e.g. \"order volume in the last 3 months, grouped by product / region / customer segment\" or \"show \nall customers who's order volume over the last 3 months is less than their average over the previous 12 months\".\n\n\nThese aggregated queries require a different data model, at least a different set of indexes v.v. the data model for the transaction system, aka operational database. Of course it's technically possibly to run these aggregate queries against the operational database directly, however it will strain its resources and potentially result in bad performance for end users.\n\n\nAnother aspect to consider is that the data needed to answer these kind of queries often span multiple systems, e.g. orders are tracked in one system, invoices in another. That is, we have to combine data from different systems, which is notoriously difficult (as in requires dedicated effort) unless there is an infrastructure that supports it.\n\n\nWith this in mind, it is easier to build a seperate database that is optimized for aggregate queries, and does not interfere with the operational database.\n\n\nRegarding the argument against storing data multiple times: That's a very common objection and it sounds logical. You don't want arbitrary copies of data stored just about everywhere - that's a valid concern. However, the need to serve analytics demands are equally valid, and following the above line of argument, they require a different technical setup. So there's a trade-off between avoiding data duplication, and the need to have well-performing systems for both operational and analytics needs.\n\n\nThey key is to build the analytics database (whatever you call it) by a controlled and managed process, that is the data is not stored arbitrarily, but the process is designed to keep the data up to date, the purpose of the duplication is to serve analytics needs, and there is ownership assigned.",

You may want to look for solutions to ragged hierarchies or whatever related to whichever BI application you are using.  We don't have a great need for drilling through hierarchies so we just went with L1, L2.... and the user adds the parent and child descriptive entities if they need that.\n\n[https://www.daxpatterns.com/parent-child-hierarchies/](https://www.daxpatterns.com/parent-child-hierarchies/)",

And of course, how will your code even know it's a cost field?\n\nHere's another example, say there's a string field - your code won't know if it requires an adjustment to some of your business logic.  Maybe it indicates a cost type?\n\nSo, if data quality matters, then it's best to have a data contract, and when the upstream system makes changes to that contract then you coordinate with them.\n\nMeanwhile, you can compare every record to the data contract to ensure that every row complies and you don't have any unapproved schema drift.",

All streaming pipelines serialize to Protobuf\n2. All Protobuf schemas are shared via a monorepo\n\nCombined you get quite a strong consistency model for data interaction at the streaming level. Protobuf is backwards/forwards compatible, and it doesn't care about the field name only its integer ID. That solves 99% of the data interaction mismatches.\n\nHaving said that you're still ultimately persisting to a database somewhere, and that part will require an unavoidable migration. This is where the hack-ish solutions are usually found. Usually here you either go with the slow-but-safe versioning approach or with a simpler 'all downstream services upgrade simultaneously' one. Or just don't rename a field unless there's a strong business requirement. Pick your poison.\n\n\nEDIT: there is actually a cleaner option for column renaming in *some* databases, though I personally haven't used it. You could create a new column that defaults to values from the old one. For example in ClickHouse you could do this:\n\n    CREATE TABLE example (\n        old_name String,\n        new_name String DEFAULT old_name\n    )    \n\nThis effectively creates an alias for the same field (at the cost of duplicated storage), and  you can then slowly deprecate the old field at your leisure. The caveat being that inserts into the new column won't be visible in the old one. I don't necessarily recommend going this route, but it would prevent going down the versioning rabbit-hole.",

Supabase is basically PostgREST plus auth and storage if you need hosted options.

This gives you the ability to implement data governance, ensure data quality, and maintain audit trails. Plus, you'll have the flexibility to serve multiple clients from the same source without cross contamination.\n\nYou can implement client specific transformations, add data validation layers, and set up automated monitoring to ensure data freshness and accuracy. The slight complexity of the process pays dividends in maintainability and scalability, especially if you plan to onboard more clients with similar requirements. Also consider if your client has other data sources they'd want integrated, platforms like Windsor.ai excel at selective data extraction from multiple channels with proper tenant isolation, which could create a more comprehensive analytics ecosystem alongside your survey insights.",

I absolutely do think this sort of change, like details of a publication, should be part of a CI pipeline, using one of the tools for managing database migrations. Flyway is one I've used with success in the past, lately I found pgroll (https://github.com/xataio/pgroll) and its innovative take very interesting, I don't have hands-on experience with it, though. Postgres can be started up very quickly in a container (it's what we're using for testing Debezium itself, too), so this can easily happen for tests on CI, too.\n\nOn the aspect of changes to a publication and thus a CDC event stream changing its schema, that's a very large topic by itself. In general, the team owning an application and its database should also be in charge of its change event streams and their schemas, evolving them with compatibility in mind, ideally implementing the idea of \"Data Products\", i.e. consciously designed data streams with a well-defined, documented, and stable contract. Stream processing with tools like Flink can be one way for shielding consumers from the impact of upstream schema changes.",

As a contractor, you have to pay the employer component of a number of taxes and other contributions, see below.\n\n\nUnlike full time employees, you are also taking on the significant risk of your contact not getting renewed at the drop of a hat. Contractors are always cut first when projects are completed or budgets get tight. Btw once there, don't let them death-march you to the finish line while only paying 40 hours per week with a promise that \"it gets better when we're done\". They will cut you off without remorse, I've seen it myself. That risk needs to get paid to reimburse you for any gaps between contracts spent looking for a new one.\n\n\nAll this to say it is customary for contractors¬† to charge¬†significantly more per hour than a full time employee, between 50% and 100% more.\n\n\nThis recruiter is trying to pull a fast one on you because they sensed your lack of knowledge. Consider yourself informed, and use chat gpt to give you a professional phrase to let them know that you are aware that they are full of shit. Read below for details, and Google for employee vs contractor tax calculators to work out what your break even rate should be.\n\n\nhttps://accountinginsights.org/irs-worker-classification-employee-vs-contractor/",

The \"terminal\" (or terminal emulator/tty/console) is the actual thing that you see on your screen that you can click and type in, and see characters on. Underneath that is the \"shell,\" which is software that knows how to take character sequences and interpret it as commands, and can then run those commands. If you type \"ls\" and hit enter, the terminal is what shows you what you just typed and the results, while the shell is the thing that was able to locate the \"ls\" command and run it. You can interchangeably use any terminal (e.g. iterm, konsole, ptyxis, ghostty, kitty) with any shell (e.g. sh, bash, fish, zsh, nushell).\n\nSSH, \"Secure SHell,\" is an encrypted server-client protocol for communicating with a shell on another machine. You still use the same terminal emulator locally, you still type in your commands and see the results. But behind that, instead of calling to a shell that's running on your machine (accessing your files, running your binaries, etc), you're sending all your keystrokes over the network to another box that has an SSH server running (called sshd). Then that SSH server acts sort-of like the terminal on that remote box, passing those keystrokes to the shell, which then runs commands on that machine (with their files, binaries, etc) and gives back the results.\n\nWhen devs say SSHing to another server, they really mean interacting with a shell\\*\\* on that server, from the comfort of their machine.\n\n\\* I'm simplifying a bit. Details @ [https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/](https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/)  \n\\*\\* Well, really SSH supports arbitrary data transfer. You can do port tunneling, send files over it (it's the default backend for scp and rsync), run GUIs remotely over a desktop gateway, whatever. But usually people don't call it \"SSHing\" in these other cases.",

It looks a little something like this:\n\n```\nmy_dict = { some_property: 'some value' }\n```\n\nThe cool part is that you can access properties in that dictionary just like in an array: `printf(f\" {my_dict[some_property]}\") # \"some value\"`.

Syntax is not as complicated once you learn it. I think the key is small problems, not projects. Something like a small math simulation.  My favorite was modelling the \"sick hobbits\" problem: \"There are 1000 hobbits on an island. X hobbits begin 'sick'. Each day, any healthy hobbit travels to visit another hobbit. If a healthy hobbit visits a sick hobbit, the healthy hobbit becomes sick. At the end of the day, all sick hobbits are removed. On average, how many hobbits will become sick? On average, how long will the contagion last, how many days?\"\n\nOnce implemented, then vary it up by changing how many hobbits are visited per day, how long the sick hobbits stay around (maybe more than one day). This type of problem is good for learning because the code for it is just a page or two.\n\nBuilding programs into projects is another skill in of itself. To do projects, you need to start worrying about system design, modularity, testing, and more advanced debugging. So, start with something a lot smaller so you can get syntax, data structures, and control flow statements down. Then move on to larger projects where you'll then need to train additional skills. The issue with projects is that you're being forced to learn too much all at once, I suspect a person would feel completely lost.\n\nI'll hate to mention, but the 'easy' leetcode problems are generally good for learning programming language syntax and basics (again, the basics are syntax, control flow, and data structures). I busted leetcode out recently to help learn Python. I don't think leetcode easy problems are necessarily the best or the most interesting; but if you can't find or come up with similar problems to the 'hobbits' problem above, then leetcode could have some decent ones for training/learning.",

Try performing the routine religiously, our brains and bodies love little routines and procedures. After a couple days, try to increase the amount of time.

So in Python you expose a web server using something like Flask, which when queried with a web browser serves a file containing HTML depending on the route (path in browser) and method (GET, POST, etc). The advantage here is that you could use a template engine like Jinja2 to serve dynamic content. The old TurboGears framework (yes I'm that old), Flask, or Django are commonly used with python, PHP is another commonly used one using the Laravel framework for example.\n\n2. API driven, here you serve endpoints (routes) with a web server and various methods just like with the server side rendering but instead of serving HTML you serve some other machine readable media formats like JSON, JSON-RPC, XML, etc. You then combine the \"backend\" with a frontend website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that calls your backend routes and then utilises that data to change the front end. React, Vue, Angular, (Ember if you're old), or more raw JQuery, are tools/frameworks to help you do that.\n\nProbably about a third of all the programming information on the Internet is about how to do this, how to get started in it, etc.",

Essentially, your backend program is responsible for preparing data to be consumed by the browser in some form or another. The simplest web program might look like this:\n\n    print('<head><title>Hello</title></head><body>Hello, world!</body>')\n\nThis can be run by telling your web server to run this script as a CGI program. This is not a modern recommended practice for several out-of-the-scope-of-this-discussion reasons but it's great for educational purposes. The idea is, you set up your web server to serve any given route by running this program and then sending the output to the client. Using this example, Python itself isn't handing HTTP requests, the web server is, and it's adding additional context that can be accessed through environment variables or even reading STDIN to handle posts, etc. \n\nOnce you've got that, you can start doing more clever things, like mapping out endpoints and having the browser make asynchronous requests to those end points to dynamically update already-loaded pages.",

When I see \"Agree\" or \"Disagree\", but they make similar points, then they have a different understanding of what they thought OP said.\n\nOK, so I'll start. I think OP believes learning a bunch of languages just to learn them is not good, at least, not at the start. Instead, pick a language, and begin solving problems, and not just learning how to write \"Hello, World\" in a dozen languages. \n\nOP did suggest that learning new languages didn't teach him more than Javascript did, but he admits that maybe some of that was failing to take a deeper dive in any of the languages.\n\nI don't think OP is saying every language is the same, but if s/he is saying that, I disagree.\n\nAs an analogy, this is like saying, what's important about learning a spoken language is what you want to talk about, i.e., the ideas, and not the words you use (which depend on language), and yet, you can be well spoken in English and don't know how to say the same thoughts in another language.\n\nWhy is it challenging? Natural languages like French or Japanese have a huge vocabulary compared to the syntax of a language. In particular, verb tenses are tricky for most. On top of that is learning the grammar, Is it subject-verb-object? Also, pronouncing words is really hard. Many non-Chinese speakers struggle with the tones in Chinese (assuming they don't also speak a tonal languages). On top of that, there are cultural differences, slang, whether to speak in complete sentences or to drop certain words, etc.\n\nProgramming languages don't have that complexity. But to say they are all the same is also wrong. For example, if you know Javascript well, but tried to learn Prolog, you'd struggle trying to find equivalent concepts. Prolog is that different from Javascript.\n\nHaving said that, I generally agree with the basic premise which is learn a language well enough to solve problems. Don't learn a bunch of languages early on, esp. superficially where you can't solve problems in any of them.\n\nMy minor quibble is the language does matter, at least, to how you think about a solution. Doing OO programming where you create classes and objects differs from doing procedural programming where you don't do that. That also differs from doing functional programming. You need to adjust how you think about programming. But in a sense, it doesn't matter which style who pick, just pick one and don't keep switching languages to know a bunch of them at a surface level.",

It is from _that_ kind of thinking, that expertise develops.\n\nWell, of course, if one wants to stay a mediocre dev with limited perspective due to limited exposure to the things that are out there, then no problem! The industry has already enough of this kind of dev and has (had?) insatiable hunger for mediocre workers.\n\nIf one wants to gain more insight though, one needs to get in contact with other languages and how they work and solve problems in them. Then out of the specific experiences with different primitives to work with, one forms a more educated overall picture and expertise.\n\nDon't obsess, alright, I agree, but don't assume, that because you have used Java, Python, JavaScript or another mainstream language for a couple of years, you know all there is to know. There is tons you don't know and there will always be tons you don't know. What matters is, that you continue learning.

Some people choose to continue learning, and maybe project Odin could be a place where such people go to learn. Some are even fortunate enough to be able to do so on the job, at some functioning organization. Most others will not or are not at organizations that encourage learning.\n\nExample: In the past I have been at an organization that had fake \"learning days\". I was not allowed to learn about some advanced computer programming topics, but someone else \"learning HTML\", that was OK. Only that I learned HTML a long time ago, at school and over time I mostly kept myself informed about what new stuff is there. I have no need of learning HTML. It is something so basic, that I would be wasting my time doing that. Knowing HTML is such a widespread thing, that it is not even anything to boast about. Yet I was denied learning, because silly middle management did not have the capability to understand the impact of the things I wanted to learn. The perspective was always short term, and they let their own lack of experience and knowledge limit what others are allowed to learn on the job. It was completely dysfunctional.\n\nI think many people in this situation would not have energy left to then learn more in their free time. That is, if they were into being a developer out of passion and learning about computational processes, and not just for the good pay. We have too many of the not passionate devs in the industry, who will jump on any hype train, as long as it pays well, messing up project after project, and being lauded for it by incapable management.\n\nMany will continue to mess up projects, introducing unnecessary complexity at many turns. Management usually doesn't realize this, because they have no proper understanding of the detailed implementation ideas and what their consequences are. Or the ever-present silly phrases like \"80-20!\", \"YAGNI!\", balblabla, which are weaponized to cut against developer concerns. You are a ticket machine! We want you to be a small cog, that we can easily replace with the next generic developer!\n\nThey are not able to distinguish between someone really knowing their stuff and someone just going with the first best idea that \"works\" (until the next requirement change, when they have to adapt their half-assed solutions again). Developing computer programs without \"programming oneself into a corner\" is a valuable skill, but also a rare skill.",

Hell even displaying information in a console isn't straightforward in functional programming. Read about Monads if you want to know what I mean (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)\n\n\nNow this isn't to say functional languages are bad. They have a lot of applications in science and research  due to the way they enforce consistency, especially when you want to parallelize operations without worrying about shared resources management. it's just that in my opinion, functional programming isn't designed for a lot of enterprise level software that modern software engineers work with.",

        "body": "You're asking more questions than you think. \n\n1.) Tech is extremely competitive. Many factors contribute to this. It used to be that tech seemed such a brain-dead obvious bet for a lucrative career that it seemed foolish *not* to attempt some sort of STEM career. This means that you can have a CS degree, several fullstack apps in your portfolio, and are able to steamroll the LeetCode 150 and not even get interviews. The constant rejection of any job search process is soul sucking, but the energy that goes into the ground level for software development makes the search a really special journey into feelings of worthlessness.\n\n2.) Gaming is the worst part of tech. That's not even discussing the wild freefall the AAA side of the industry is experiencing. The reason is because gaming is a prestige position. No matter what happens, folks like you are gonna say, \"I don't care. I want to make games.\" Because games are awesome. Since the line to work on projects is out the door, management can pay less and work their talent harder. A normal tech job outside of start-ups can give a really good work/life balance, even more so if you land a remote position. That is considerably less likely for a similar position at a gaming company. Call it crunch or \"Bioware magic,\" but those companies you dream of working for know about your dreams, for better or worse. \n\n3.) As game projects increase in scale, distribution of labor gets more distinct. You aren't \"programming a game,\" you're \"responsible for the flow of the inventory system but not the menu system itself or the actual UI of the system.\" This isn't a bad thing. It's just how the sausage is made. But it can take away some of the razzle-dazzle of \"making a game.\" \n\n4.) This is an incredible time to work in a small group or going yolo solo. Unreal Engine is free, and blueprints make it a lot more accessible than raw-dogging C++. Unity is free (but don't use Unity). Godot is free. Phaser3 is free. YouTube U is free. Check out /r/gamedev and r/IndieDev. There are posts on those forums every other day from folks who are further than you in this process asking themselves, \"Am I wasting my time?\" And the answers may be illuminating. \n\n5.) Game dev just isn't something you should be going into for love of the game if you want to make money. If you shift to the most lucrative corners of making games, you will bleed out your love, and if you focus hard on making projects of love, you won't have as much money or as much help (co-workers), and it's an uphill battle to be noticed. Undertale is the exception. Balatro is the exception. Vampire Survivors is the exception. I hope you're an exception.... but you'll probably need a day job or a rich spouse/parent. \n\n6.) Learning to program is worth it as a skill on its own, I truly believe that. I LOVE that I can have an idea, think about how to make it, and just... make it. It's a really, really fun superpower. It was also really hard won. Understanding how all the pipes fit together beneath the user level is incredibly useful. I think everyone should at least learn to build and deploy a CRUD app without AI so they can just understand what the hell is happening. That said, there are other parts of the game industry than programmers or artists, same as there are other paths in \"tech\" besides engineers, bright-eyed founders, and parasitic C-suite villains.",

If you don‚Äôt know how to do something in a given language, google it and you‚Äôll be fine.\n\nI‚Äôm working on my chess engine right now, and this process has made a problem with no obvious solution (at a glance) decently easy to solve. The important thing is to start with something very small, and with each project you make something bigger. You wouldn‚Äôt go to the gym and lift something ridiculously heavy on your first day, you need to build up to it.\n\nAlso, good luck with university!

Having a problem to solve, understanding the requirements, and partitioning the solution into manageable chunks are some of the more difficult tasks when participating in any project. Right now, though, programming seems like the hard part, because it's still new. Over time, and with practice, you'll begin to develop the fluency you need to confidently express your ideas in code. Like learning to ride a bicycle, one day it's all just going to *click* and you're not even going to realize it's happened until you're cruising.\n\nYou still have a lot more to learn in CS, and it's probably going to get harder before it gets easier. Use that to your advantage! Take everything you learn as an opportunity to practice writing code. Way back when I was in college, I wrote my own collection of all the data structures and algorithms I learned; reinventing the wheel not only helped me to better understand what I was learning, but it gave me lots of practice. Just keep at it, stay positive, and be curious. You got this!",

Whichever editor you choose though, just make sure to record whatever config setup you end up with so you can easily spin it up again in the future (e.g. dotfiles repo).

If you're spending a bunch of time learning a little bit about a lot of different languages, then you'll never build up your depth. Pick one language to really focus on, and then you'll discover that the other languages will naturally come easier over time, as you make connections.\n2. In whatever language you've chosen, learn as many built-in functions (and operators, syntax, etc.) in that language as you can (with the theoretical goal of learning all of them). New programmers often make things harder than they need to be on themselves, because they don't realize all of the tools that the language offers (and they try to write extra utilities themselves, or reach for code from the Internet or third-party packages, when the language already offers a helpful tool built-in).\n3. Just like how when you're at the gym, you don't do each exercise only once and move on to a new exercise, apply the same approach to coding. Once you get your code working, start over from a completely blank slate, and try to do it again. See if you can look up even a *little* less than you needed to look up last time, or if you run into a little bit fewer bugs than you did last time. You'll find that once you do something five or ten times, you have a *way* deeper understanding than you thought you did after you only did it once.",

I got tired of the job after a bit and decided to explore programming, thinking how could it be different? Well it turned out to be quite a bit different, but I became very passionate about it and good at it. I just graduated with my BS and am going for my Masters here soon. \n\nThis was something I was worried about when I first started my journey, with such a huge switch in professions. It was hard and kept thinking that I am not cut out for this but I persevered through it and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. This is a huge shift from what you did to this, so yes it is going to be rough but sticking it out will be worth it if you‚Äôre already starting to enjoy it. From what I gathered CS50 course is hard depending on the person but it has a great amount of info and goes into depth about important topics. \n\nSo if you can I would say keep trying and if you don‚Äôt get something, then take some extra time to look it up and find more information about it. I also had a kid during my undergrad so I feel you on the struggling portion. Keep it up, you got this!",

Well there a bunch of space before, a bunch of \"o\" in the middle and then we go to next line so the code become:\n\n    for each line \n      print_spaces(numbers of spaces)\n      print_stars(numbers of o)\n\nNow can you do print\\_spaces and print stars ?

That's not so different than\n\n    line = \" \".repeat(number of spaces) + \"o\".repeat(number of o)\n\nor even:\n\n    print \" \".repeat(number of spaces) + \"o\".repeat(number of o)\n\nNow how many number of stars we have per line ?

And in my experience most jobs, even the more intellectual ones (or maybe especially those) have the clich√© that they give you freedom of how-to-do-this-task, no monotony but possibility to be even creative, and so on.\nMy experience is that sure some people are lucky and get their visions and wishes related to their job satisfied and most things are as great as they expected, but that's unfortunately more exception than a rule...\n\nI studied chemistry for few years and how did I learn for maths, physics, chemistry modules etc.? By f-ing REPEATING various catalogs of \"questions/tasks that can be asked in the exam\". That's frustrating and I'd hope less people would have to work and especially to learn this way (because it's one of the heaviest turn-offs imo).\n\nBefore I drift off into more pessimistic stuff, one thing I can tell you as a (hobby-)musician and occassional painter that aside from let's say 0.1% of the population who have superpowers, top genetics and were raised very effective & without any damages, creativity is a bit like natural mutual attraction (\"love\") - you can't enforce it. Still you want to achieve it, how you should do that?\n\nBy doing certain activities, which you have to find out for yourself, what fits for you somehow, the newer and the more they differ from each other, the better. Just try things out you wanted to f.e.. You will gain experience, expand your conciousness (literally & still in a natural way), the more contrasts you can gather and experience, the better. Nothing is true, everything is permitted!\nAnd by automatically building new associative nodes & connections in your neural system / \"soul\" through this gathering of new experiences, by natural passive (\"background-process\"-)learning you will already make one step after the other on the way to more creativity. Will, patience and time - I know, we all need especially the second one, but it's possible :)\n\nA bit untypical my whole post, but I hope this gives you some inspiration and new thoughts.

However, code in the real world has to be constantly maintained by several developers.

But it's rarely (i.e. almost never) important to have the \"perfect mathematical solution\" to a given problem, even assuming one exists.\n\nFor this particular problem, I would personally look at the pattern first. How many spaces do you need to print at each row, if the pyramid has a height of 4? Do it manually first in a text editor: 3, 2, 1, 0. Now, what if it has a height of 5? Manually in a text editor: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.\n\nNow do the same for how many \"o\"s you need to print. That one is a little easier. It always starts at 1 and then it always advances by 2, to count out all the odd numbers until the pyramid is done: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ....\n\nSo in this situation I would say that the \"goold ol' C-style for loop\" is easier to understand in this situation. Luckily JavaScript supports that style of loop:\n\n    // Pretend that height comes from the user.\n    let height = 4;\n    // Starting out the pyramid with an initial \\n so that it looks\n    // nicer inside the JS Console.\n    let pyramid = \"\\n\";\n    let ohs = 1;\n    for (let spaces = height-1; spaces >= 0; spaces--, ohs += 2) { \n        pyramid += \" \".repeat(spaces) + \"o\".repeat(ohs) + \"\\n\";\n    }\n    console.log(pyramid);\n\nSome people won't like that style and will prefer a more \"functional\" or \"mathematically correct\" style. But at the end of the day your job is to solve whatever problem you have, in a way that is easy for you to understand and which is fast enough. The above solution is perhaps less \"elegant\" but it gets the job done and it's usually easier to debug code like that than to debug code which is too much in a functional \"mathematical\" style.",

Personally, I find saying \"I'm a software engineer or developer\" a bit pretentious, but if I were putting it on a resume, I'd probably use the words and not programmer/coder.\n\nBut, that's just me.",

C is a bit unforgiving, it totally lets you shoot yourself in the foot and C++ lets you do the same, except that your entire leg is gone afterwards.\n\nBeware of any mention, that C++ and C# are just supersets of C. That might have been true very very early on, but both have diverged from C quite a bit, some things just work differently.\n\nFind a resource, that teaches C with a proper focus on how to write secure code, having to debug undefined Behaviour, memory leaks and segfaults is no fun if you just came from python. Personally I like the book \"Effective C\" by Robert C Seacord. Despite the name, (effective LANGUAGE usually means advanced in a lot of programming books) it is written for beginners, but it is well written, up to date and doesn't make stupid errors where the example code won't even compile (surprisingly common).\n\nThen, once you have a grip on the language, implement various algorithms, like the problems on [projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net), reading and processing some files, playing with raylib (since you came from gamedev with godot). The best way to learn C is writing programs in C, but they need to be small self contained things that compile cleanly and pass through valgrind cleanly. But most importantly, you need to understand various concepts of C first, otherwise the compiler will be like a girlfriend you forget to feed.\n\nIf you have a sound understanding of computer science, you might read the K&R book, but it is written for seasoned programmers that just don't know C, yet. It is from a time when Programmers already went through college and might had a PhD or a Master at minimum, home computers and self-taught coders weren't really a thing yet. It assumes that you know how computers work, potentially already have programmed in some form of assembly. It's more of a historic document than a valid learning resource. Don't get me wrong on this, it's a great read and you definitely should read it at some point in your learning journey, but it isn't the *best* way to learn C, anymore.",

Especially when it comes to strings, arrays and \"objects\" and sending them between functions.\n\nC++ and C# are just two c-like languages, almost every modern language have a very similar syntax to C, including Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Rust, Zig, Go, Dart, Swift and many others. So unless you stick entirely to Python you'll get to see the C syntax (pun intended). (See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_C-family\\_programming\\_languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages) for a comprehensive list)\n\nIf you are interested in hardware, you could try your hand at some Arduino programming - that is done in C++, but usually limited to \"C with classes\", and you can often decide for yourself if you want to rely on libraries and just write something, or if you want to dive deeper, go full low level, and access the hardware directly.

There are still a lot of jobs available, but the gold rush is over, at least for now. \n\nIf you want to get into development, choose a language and framework and start building applications. Being able to create and deploy software is table stakes these days. \n\nUnderstand SOLID and basic software architecture. Understand SQL and relational database concepts. You should still be familiar with your data structures and algorithms, and having some experience working with LLMs is an excellent idea. \n\nAnd make sure you know how to deploy your apps to the cloud. A good portfolio site will show that you're familiar with all the concepts I list above. \n\nThe bar is higher than it has been in the recent past, which I've seen catch many CS grads who didn't apply themselves off guard. That doesn't mean the bar is infinitely high, though. If you know your foundational skills and you have some experience building non-trivial applications, you should be able to find a way into the industry, although it might take some patience and persistence. \n\nGood luck to you.",

One of the keys to programming and software design is learning how to break the big overall goal into smaller goals. Then solve those and get them working individually, then stitch them together. \n\nSo for example if you want a stock analysis and trading platform, start by modeling the price of a stock at a given instance of time (a single bar, whether that's a day, an hour, a 5 minute interval, whatever it might be). Then build an overall history that accumulates those individual pieces, maybe give that the ability to calculate analyses like EMA, stochastics, or whatever. \n\nThen model a portfolio that can track buys, sells, profit/ loss, etc of individual stocks. \n\nThen build something that will fetch historical data from an online source and build up your historical data. Might also need that to analyze the data for cleaning: find holes, potential anomalies, normalize for splits, etc. \n\nI'm not familiar enough with crypto to know the analog, but hopefully that gives you a way to begin. \n\nPython would be fine for this if you're not planning to do real time analysis. If you want something that can analyze data in real time, you're looking at C, C++, Rust, Zig, or something else that's a systems level language. You don't need to start there, but that's where you'd want to aim to get.",

In the U.S. an example might be Minneapolis or Atlanta. Both cities have lots of software jobs but nothing like Silicon Valley, Seattle, or NYC. Look at job openings and see what languages, frameworks, tools, and specialties companies are looking for there.\n\nSince you're a CS major, an internship can be the best way to break in.

This is done **within the same stack frame**, and the function does not create new stack memory. Memory stays constant and predictable unless you create new objects manually.\n\nHowever, in case of recursion, each function call gets **its own stack frame** in the call stack. This stack frame stores local variables, return address, parameters, etc., When a recursive call is made, the current function is paused and pushed onto the call stack. Once the base condition is met, the calls start returning one by one as the stack entries are popped.\n\nNow you might understand that if you go too deep using recursion, it will cause too much of piling on the stack and if the input is too big, it would end up creating a **StackOverflowError**.\n\nHope it is helpful :) I'll may be write a detailed blog post on my Substack and a link here later when it is done.",

There is also Machine Learning and data science libraries for JavaScript like Tensorflow.js but Python is usually the better choice for anything Data Science-y.\n\nFor freelancing, I feel like HTML, CSS and JavaScript are better options. There is always somebody looking to build a website, and you can also use these same technologies to make mobile apps and desktop apps.\n\nMy recommendation? HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

A typical place to draw this line is at the edge of well defined objects in your domain\n\nLayers help you stick to solving for certain implementation problems related to a subset of the technology. Some common layers are\n- data store \n- data access or orm \n- domain or business logic\n- api\n- presentation \n\nWhat I've found is that the edge seems to be a bit wider in the presentation layer than what you want for the domain layer and to do that you sometimes want to inflate the boundary in the data access layer, but this can introduce problems with the domain layer\n\nA good compromise is to create summary types which you can refer to in the presentation layer without having to load entire objects\n\nHappy to talk through this stuff.

If you have a string pointer like `char *str`, then dereferencing it with `*str` gives you the first character of the string. Calling `strcpy(*str1, *str2)` would be just passing the *value* of the strings' first characters, instead of the string pointers themselves.\n\nWhen you call `strcpy(str1, str2)`, you're not assigning to `str1`, and you're not changing the value of the pointer `str1`.

You have to use a pointer. Arrays have never become full first-class values in C. You also can't assign one array to another:\n\n    int x[2];\n    int y[2];\n    x = y;\n\nThe reason, 50 years ago, was that it would have required emitting too many assembly language instructions from that one statement (and passing a large array as a value can overflow your stack); the restriction has never been lifted because `strcpy` and `memcpy` work better for most people.*\n\nAs for why it's a pointer to the first character of the string and not to the string: pointers in C are designed to be the interface to arrays. They're how you access any element of an array, any time you do. An array, when used as a value, is always converted to a pointer to its first element; adding (or subtracting) an integer to a pointer moves it that many places through the array, and, of course dereferencing the result accesses the selected element.\n\n`x[i]` is syntax sugar for `*(x + i)`, which means (assuming `x` is an array): take a pointer to the first element of `x`, move that pointer (hopefully forward) `i` positions, then get the element at that location.\n\nSo once you have a pointer into an array, you can access the whole array from there.\n\n\n* Citation needed, according to anyone who's ever passed the wrong length to `memcpy` and smashed the return address on the call stack.

        "body": "Sorry if this is not what you're looking for but here's a brief summary using C as an example because it is kinda the base and most other languages like java and python run by doing something with C.\n\nFirst, computers have CPUs, they are the things doing the instructions your code makes. Code and CPU instructions aren't a one to one mapping, the way a language works is it must be translated to CPU instructions. In the case of C the thing that does this is called a compiler.\n\n  \nCPU instructions are whats known as binary code. Assembly language is a CPU specific programming language that takes CPU binary code and puts labels on specific binary strings that mean do this thing. For example ADD. CPUs also have access to registers, which just hold a few bytes of values, for example a 32 bit machine 4 bytes 64 8 bytes, etc. These registers are what the CPU uses to do math with. So ADD register1, register2 would take the sum of these two numbers and put it into register 1.\n\n  \nAssembly is a 1:1 mapping with that architectures binary, meaning if you learn to understand it you can write code that tells the CPU exactly what to do. C is an abstraction on assembly, meaning that it let's you write code, the compiler does something, then you get an assembly file. For your use case you don't need to know how this file works, but the general theory is pretty simple, basically it builds a stack, which is just like a pile of variables, and the compiler writes the assembly in a way that instead of variable int x, it's base of the stack + 10 bytes or something. And that is how it knows where x lives. But again you don't need to know this right now.\n\n  \nWhat you need to know is that when you compile C code, you get an executable, a file you can run directly in the command line, or just run like any other windows exe or other executable I forget the mac and linux extensions. You can do this in command line or depending on the code treat the executable like it's own app.\n\nPython is a little different. Python itself is a language built in C. Python does not compile into an executable, python is an executable. When you click run, all it does is the command python3 yourfilename.py. python3 is an assembly file that opens the file yourfilename.py, reads what you wrote, and then figures out what to do with the text and updates things accordingly. You CAN compile python, but it's not popular, not efficient and kinda weird.\n\n  \nSorry this is random and disorganized thoughts, please if you have questions ask me i like talking about this stuff if you couldn't already tell.",

Bootstrap has pre-built components, whereas tailwind just provides utility classes to completely make your own UI.\n\nCan you elaborate on the css classes being messy? If you mean the order in which they are written, I can definitely see how they may be perceived as messy, though I feel this is very common with tailwind from my experience. There may be a tool that organizes the classes for you that I‚Äôm unaware of though. Or perhaps bootstrap just looks organized due to being comprised of pre-built components?\n\nTailwind css is also mobile first, but I inverted the breakpoints to make it desktop-first because I had no plans on making the mobile version of the application.\n\nYes I definitely use the mobile viewports. They‚Äôre especially very good on Firefox.\n\nThank you!",

Deep learning and the transformer architecture have upended traditional approaches in many fields and this is a case where a textbook written even 5 years ago will be grossly out of date.",

If you want to learn Web Development for example then I can say the Odin Project is a fantastic free resource. Almost everything I know about web programming I learned from the Odin Project. However, there is one important point you need to know when starting this journey. The motivation you feel right now will disappear, usually around the time when you can't solve some hard problem or can't fix a bug or you are trying for hours and don't get anywhere. Programming, especially once you can actually build cool Apps yourself can be very rewarding until it's not and you question why you even started. Just don't give up when you get to moments like that. Also don't let AI solve your problems. You might think you learned something if AI is doing the work but you actually didn't. If you gonna use AI then use it to ask questions about a concept you don't understand but don't vibe code your way to an app as you won't learn anything this way.",

A good design gives you that \"ah hah\" feeling when reading through the code, like \"oh, someone really thought about how this was going to work\".\n\nOf the two, I would say that having a good design is about 50x more important than having good \"style\". If you give me a program with bad style but a good design, then all I have to do is run clang-format on it (or the equiivalent). However, if you give me a program with a terrible design, then there's no amount of automation that can fix that. It's like building a house on a bad foundation.\n\nNow, that being said, if you can't even be bothered to run code styling tools on your code, then if you were to give me your code, then it will inevitably create some kind of a mildly to grossly bad impression in my opinion. It's a bit like sending me an e-mail riddled with typos. Sure, maybe I can still read it, but couldn't you have at least taken 2 seconds to press F7 and do the spell check before sending it?

Even intermediate and advanced programmers look at their code and wonder why they wrote it so badly (though it's often at a level higher than you--usually, it's overcomplicated or convoluted compared to beginner code).\n\nYou're just a month in. Just learn a few ideas.\n\nHere are some quick ones.\n\n* Learn good variable names and function names (harder than you think, but valuable).\n* Write lots of short functions (a bit controversial), say 50 lines at most.\n* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Don't copy/paste the same code. If you're doing that, write a function that has that common code.\n\nYou're writing smaller projects that's maybe 500 lines or so. This doesn't require the same level of organization as huge programs with many files. However, it is good to organize the code within a single file.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't worry about how fast your program runs. It runs fast. Until you learn DSA (mostly the algorithms), it's hard to improve the speed, and often meaningless. \n\nOh yes, learn from others. You'll see better solutions out there. Don't beat yourself up that you didn't come up with it. Most people can't come up with brilliant code. Instead, they see others, and imitate it.

I get so wrapped up in writing efficient code that I keep rewriting modules before I complete a minimum viable product (MVP).  I attribute this to two things, one im obsessive but really two is I dont take the time to plan my projects first.  I just jump straight into code.  Can't stress how important it is to have a long whiteboard session at the beginning.  Map out the plan and stick to it until mvp.  Test it, show it to the customer, then refactor only if necessary.   And usually you will only be refactoring for maintainability and readability not for efficiency.   You're just starting so you are a long ways off from needing to write \"efficient\" code.  Most of the time people toil days or weeks to reduce a few lines of code which ultimately saves microseconds.   Not worth it you'll burn out and start accumulating tech debt.  So I agree with the general sentiment of get it working first then tune it only if necessary. \n\nPoint of clarity, im not saying do not write \"clean\" code that's different.

If the goal you want to accomplish is \"create a file called `foo`\", then there is basically no difference in complexity between writing the code itself and writing the test that checks whether file `foo` exists.\n\nBut most of the time, if the code you're writing isn't stupidly boring, then code to do X won't just look like a function call or statement that says \"do X\". In that case, you'll have to *think* about how to solve the problem you're faced with. And there is always a possibility of making a mistake in your thinking. Those are the mistakes that tests can help you catch.\n\nTo use your example of input validation: Maybe you have a set of ideas in your head about what kinds of inputs are valid, and what inputs are invalid. And maybe you write a regex that matches only valid inputs. The test exists to make sure you wrote that regex correctly, so that its behavior matches what you had in mind.\n\n(You could argue that if the regex is wrong, you'll notice the problem just by running the code and experimenting with it. Doing this kind of interactive testing is good, but on its own, it's a very unreliable and error-prone way of testing. Writing the tests down in an automated test suite helps you make sure you didn't miss anything. And most importantly, it tells you if a later change introduces a new bug, without you having to manually test every single feature every time you touch the code.)\n\nOf course it's possible you'll make a mistake in the tests too. But tests don't have to be perfect in order to be useful. Even if they only catch *some* of your mistakes, they can still save you time and effort.",

The reason you write tests isn't necessarily because you want to catch all of the things you already thought of.\n\nWriting tests is inherently tricky. The essence of writing tests is thinking about the ways that your code might fail, and then enshrining that in a test. For simple functions, that's easier than it is for complex functions.\n\nI think the core thing that you're missing is that tests aren't for testing whether your particular slice of code works under ideal conditions; it's often more about future-proofing your code, like when you make changes to variables, or the way that certain key variables are broadly calculated; and suddenly your tests can alert you that your function isn't working as intended because you couldn't account for how your code would evolve in the future.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

Semantics can vary.\n\nEdit:\n\nI also like the answer in the reddit thread someone else linked that mutexs can be reentrant. Reentrancy doesnt really make sense for semaphores.\n\nThe top answer talks more about the fact that semaphores are built for managing concurrent access to a pool of resources (they store a counter for how many \"resources\" are available), where as mutexes are about critical sections. For clean code, you should really use these constructs for only the associated purpose above, even if you can use the other, since the names \"semaphore\" and \"mutex\" come with these connotations.\n\nAdditionally, just sticking to using them for these purposes will basically automatically help you avoid problems with differences in reentrancy and and who can call up()/unlock().",

If you just go into the gym and start throwing weights around, you might get a bit stronger, but you're likely to do a lot of things wrong, be inefficient with your time, and get injured.

But of course, if you *only* read and never set foot in the gym, merely reading won't get you stronger. It's when you combine the two‚Äîthe principles and routines from books, and the practice from going to the gym‚Äîthat you get good results.\n\nThe same is true with programming. Read good books to learn the principles and techniques, and then build projects to get practice with those principles and techniques.

Note that the last type argument of a `Func<>` is the return type. \n\nSo `Func<SomeObject, SomeOutput>` matches a method `SomeOutput MethodName(SomeObject arg)`\n\nSo instead of multiple ifs or switch statements, you can do something like this:\n\n```\nDictionary<string, Func<SomeObject, SomeOutput>> handlers;\n\nvoid Init()\n{\n    handlers.Add(\"A\", HandlerA);\n    handlers.Add(\"B\", HandlerB);\n}\n\nvoid Handle(string value)\n{\n    if(handlers.TryGet(value, out var handler))\n    {\n        var output = handler(input)\n    }\n    throw new ArgumentOrOfRangeException(nameof(value));\n}\n\nprivate SomeOutput HandlerA(SomeObject value)\n{\n    // Do something for for value A...\n}\n\nprivate SomeOutput HandlerB(SomeObject value)\n{\n    // Do something for for value B...\n}\n```",

When you are good at programming, the language really doesn't mater you can pick up a new one in a weekend for fun.\n\nIf you are pre-college I would say use whatever language you like, learn it, build programs with it, get good at programming i.e. breaking large problems down into smaller problems, then breaking those smaller problems down into even smaller problems, keep doing that until you can tell the computer what steps it needs to perform.\n\nWhen I went to college a long long time ago, there was basically 1 de-facto language, C, that was the language it best to know because most people there knew it and you could do your assignments in C.  Not sure if colleges these day have a de-facto language.  But if you are in college being good with the defacto language would probably be best.\n\nIf you are out of college but not working, look at what jobs are in the area, or look at what kinds of jobs you want and see what language(s) they would like you to have.  \n\nIf you are working then get good at the language you are using at work before branching out.  \n\nIf you are retired do whatever the hell you want. :-)",

A significant part of our job is process/red-tape. At startups, process/red-tape can be straight up non-existant. You're lucky if you end up at a startup that has some halway decent dev processes in place.\n\nBut at a large company, process is key. There are very strict best practices in place. There's very strict change management, very strict approvals, very strict boundaries of responsibility, etc, etc, etc. They're simply too large to let devs just cowboy code some stuff into prod that gets introduced to their millions of users right away. They also have internal and external audits to think about, where they're straight up auditing *the process*. If your processes aren't good, you're going to fail an audit, and failing an external audit can have a significant negative impact on the company and its clients.\n\nAll companies will feel slow compared to startups. Not just big tech. Startups are trying to get their code and product out into the world as fast as humanly possible. It's like Facebook's old mantra (which they've since ditched) \"Move Fast and Break Things\". Who cares if what you released into prod broke something? You'll have a patch up in 10 minutes.\n\nEstablished companies are more focused on keeping things stable, not distrupting their user base, staying in compliance with all the many compliance/regulations/frameworks they need to abide to to make their customers feel warm and fuzzy inside. A short downtime can easily lose 6-7 figures for them, whereas a startup DGAF about downtime. The benefit of releasing code quickly outweights whatever negative would come from prod issues.\n\nOne thing that will be very valuable for *you* from a career-growth perspective is seeing what heavy-process looks like. Look at what this company is doing, how it differs from the startup world, what the pros/cons are, etc. That gives you multiple perspectives to view any given problem from in the future. You can consider stability and process, while also considering quick delivery. There's ***a lot*** of companies in-between the 2 extremes that highly value that kind of perspective.",

This was widely known as the chill job for SWEs. I worked 20 hour weeks and was an overperformer and I did Scrum master duties on the side. Had I stayed i'd probably be considered a Sr Level 2, or a Principal by now and im only 7 YOE. \n\nI left due to pay (started at 75k and made close to 90k after 4 years) and lack of work tbh. But if you can get in one of those jobs, quickly get a security clearance, you are all set. They try to retain people in these jobs because of the clearances. So even in down years at most you might just be thrown in some repetitive maintenance project until better projects come. \n\nIt sounds like you are lookiing more for this type of work. DOnt get me wrong, there are things that you mentioned that still happened, like managers expecting impossible tasks to be done but tbh, most people barely bat an eye when it takes you forever to complete a task.

A service like Applyre might be helpful. Also consider smaller companies and startups for SWE roles. \n\nThey often have more practical technical interviews focused on actual work rather than leetcode puzzles.

I'm not stupid, I know the one and only reason you're reaching out to me is to advance your career. You're not reaching out to me because you want to be buddies, or want to form a genuine relationship. You're reaching out to me to use my status for your benefit. The minute you no longer need anything from me, we're not going to continue talking, or having coffee chats.\n\nThe alumni from my University that are a part of my network are the ones that *I knew in college*. My genuine friends. People I directly worked with, studied with, partied with, etc. The fact you happened to go to the same school I did doesn't really mean anything to me, there's hundreds of thousands of livnig alumni from my University. Over ten thousand graduate every year. Can you imagine if even one percent of the alumni base sent me LinkedIn messages asking for a coffee chat?\n\nIf you met me in a bar, or doing some hobby out in the wild, we got to talking, found out we went to the same college, and became fast friends, *then* I would be happy to refer you. We formed a genuine relationship *first*, in an environment where I don't feel like you're using me or the connection was fake. *That's* what I consider networking. Making friends in the wild. This actually happens quite a lot to me, there's a lot of alumni living in my city, and I've made some good friends because of it.\n\nI'm not actively annoyed at getting cold messages or anything, I'm not getting angry, I'm not personally offended that someone tried to reach out to me. I just ignore them.\n\nDon't let me discourage you though.... maybe 1000 alumni ignore you, but 1 responds and you get a job because of it. So it could totally still be worth it, and there's not really a downside. That's just how I personally view cold messaging, and I feel like most of the people I know personally operate the same way.",

It took my heart and soul just to get any kind of offer, and I am so ready to get back to trying to turn my life around.\n\nI wasn't FAANG material, but I worked pretty hard. I graduated w/ a Master's in CS + 2 years intern + 1 year full time -> had a big name F500 100k TC full-stack job lined up before I even finished school.\n\nThat F500 was amazing, but 1.5 year in I got mass laid off. It took me 3 months to find my next job.\n\nMy next job was awesome too (for the most part, 1/4 of it was a tough crunch period), I got in at 105k fully remote security clearance in the same stack. I felt like I was really starting to get the hang of things.\n\nHowever, 1 year into *that* job, I got mass laid off again. Unlucky!\n\nThen I began my descent into the hellish reality of me trying to get a job in 2025. I actually had no issues getting interviews. I have a very strong resume, I was able to secure a couple referrals from my network. I was also pretty resourceful / lucky at just cold dm'ing or trying to be the first 20 people to apply to a job.\n\nMy problem was, I am/was just not that good at interviewing! I was completely caught off guard how awful this last 6-7 months would be. At first, I was like it's just rust and we'll get other chances. I went on to fail A LOT of interviews.\n\nI actually have had 21 different positions that have made it to technical rounds. Of those 21, I got 2 offers and 3 are in progress (plus a 22nd chance round 2 this week for a remote job!)\n\nIt's been absolutely miserable. Some jobs were actually laterals or upgrades in pay / situation, some even remote. Most of these jobs though are pretty sizeable paycuts + bad commutes and I wasn't good enough for them.\n\nI still have a few interviews / leads building up so I'll keep taking them until I actually start my new job, but man I can't wait for this to be over. I'm going to work hard at my new job and establish the workload. If it ends up being chill, I'm going to just go right back to studying for interviews on the job whenever I can and keep fighting until I can get a big salary and/or remote again.\n\nI wish anyone on the journey best of luck and to keep believing in your hard work. I still dont 100% trust I'm actually going to have a job in a few weeks, I've been in survival mode for so long..\n\nFor what it's worth.. I got some pretty crazy feedback at some of these jobs. I got told for a few positions that the people I was competing with had 5+ years experience. Can't confirm that for all of them, but I legit have made it as a top 2 finalist twice and didn't get it. Competition is just insane out there right now.",

I find that startups are more willing to hire. I've used builtinnyc.com, but there are \"BuiltIns\" for multiple cities. wellfound.com is good too. I do find they tend to skew NYC and SF based roles though.¬†\n\n\n- When applying, if there's a section for \"skills\" that's fill-in-the-blank, go back to the job description and make sure to list any skill you find there that you have. If it's for a specific tech but you know a related one, go ahead and put down the specific one. One of my biggest annoyances is recruiters not believing that, for instance, your Postgres skills are not transferable to MySQL. Or express.js vs fastify. Or React vs Vue etc. If they're that rigid and don't understand what it is an actual engineer brings to the table, don't feel bad about it.\n\n\nI applied to the exact same job twice about a month apart, once without doing any of this and then after doing all of this. First time, email rejection after a couple of weeks. Second time, instant email inviting me to a technical screening. Somewhere in the mix, some automatic filtering must be happening, so try to fight against it.\n\n\nGood luck!",

When I was transitioning from med school to tech, I spent way too much time in forums like this getting discouraged by all the doom posts instead of just focusing on building.\n\nThe truth is, people having a tough time are way more likely to post about it than people who are doing fine. It creates this warped perception where it seems like everyone's struggling when really it's just that the struggling voices are the loudest ones.\n\nI started Metana in 2022 when everyone was saying 'tech is dead' and 'bootcamps don't work' yet we've hit $1M ARR because companies still need good developers. The online noise didn't match what was actually happening in the market.\n\nHere's what I'd focus on instead of endlessly tweaking resumes. Pick one solid project and make it really impressive. Not just another todo app, but something that solves a real problem you care about. Then write about your process, document your learning, show your thinking. Employers care way more about how you approach problems than your school ranking.\n\nAlso, you mentioned 3 internships, that's actually solid experience. Maybe the issue isn't your background but where you're applying? Sometimes casting a wider net geographically or looking at companies that aren't the typical FAANG targets can open up opportunities.\n\nThe market is tough right now, no sugarcoating that. But good developers are still getting hired every day. Keep building, keep applying, and try to spend less time in forums that make everything seem impossible :)",

I know most of the jobseekers will take a job anywhere to get the foot in the door, but I implore each of you when you go through an unreasonable hiring process to run the other way. \n\nI've never done leetcode. I've never had a take home assignment. I've done a skill assessment that was pass fail and that's my limit.\n\nIf at any point the interview turns into a graded or ranked test I leave. It's not how mature software shops work. I've been in various shops for almost 15 years. That's how shops with high turnover work. The #1 asset a team has is its knowledge of the project. The #2 is the stability and organization to improve the project. Nowhere in there is it advantageous to search for some 2x programmer who's going to take a new job in 6 months after posting to cscareerquestions. Instead we gel extremely well, know our strengths and weaknesses, and operate as a team.\n\n  \nPeople retire from my current shop. I hope I'm that lucky. \n\nThis sub has a lot of posts of people chasing FAANG careers and debasing themselves for ridiculous hiring practices. It scares all the students. But here's the deal: Software shops are everywhere; FAANG has notoriously fired full divisions and teams that were discovered to be doing nothing and were only hired as a flex; Some shops have a high turnover rate and only intend to keep developers for 3 years unless they fit in a management track; Plenty of asshole bosses have \"We're hiring,\" competitions to nab that top talent out of a pool of 500 applicants, but won't settle for #2 or 3.  \n  \nBuild stuff.

The rest of the world is generally less so, you will need to achieve a high level of fluency before you will have any luck looking for work and even then, there are some cultures (ex. Germany, Turkiye, most of eastern Europe) that would rather hire someone from that culture who speaks English over an outsider who speaks their language. You will never have priority over someone from that culture, unless you offer a particular technical skillset that they can't find. This is xenophobia imo but it is what it is.\n\n2. People tend to be misled by online courses claiming they can become fluent in 3-6 months. You can learn the basics of many languages quickly, but actual fluency can take years, especially if you want to read and write Mandarin. In terms of professional development and career payoff, the ROI relative to effort is very low. You could learn several new tech stacks well in the time it would take you to learn Mandarin.\n\n3. The tech industry works primarily in English. One of my former employers had teams in China and Portugal that I worked closely with and it wasn't uncommon for them to discuss technical problems in English.\n\nI speak several languages to a relatively high degree of fluency and, while it's a great hobby for personal growth, the payoff is really poor for career opportunities. If you want to do it because you just like those cultures, go for it, but I wouldn't expect to get anything from a professional development perspective.",

Depending on the place you're employed that may not be an option. IE if you're in a faang and they pay you a dump truck full of money every year that may not be an option for you. If you're expected to push through the burn out or get pipped out, you may want to start looking for a job with better wlb and take the pay cut. There's only a special type of person that can go ham literally 100% of the time.\n\n\nBut, if you are already in a position where you can decide to put up some boundaries when needed then you NEED to do it asap.¬†\n\n\nFor now: Since you are already burned out, you have to stop working at the end of the day AND learn how to turn off your work brain when you do. It is a skill and it takes practice. It's like meditation.¬†\n\nWhen you catch yourself doing a work thought you need to intentionally and consciously think about something else. If that means you go do something else or change your physical location then that's what you do. You need to stop thinking about work in order to recover from work.\n\n\nOnce youve already crossed over into being burned out, it may take some time (weeks or months depending on how bad the burnout is) for better boundaries to start making you feel better. But in my experience it does eventually happen. Just remember for the future that you need to be vigilant about the signs that you're working too much. It's something we do to get ahead and it can be good but if you want to be at your best you have to compromise with what is possible. Don't ignore your warning signs. It will take longer to recover the longer you push past them.",

You're not complaining, you're establishing expectations.\n\nIf anything, *not* communicating that and just bottling it up, and quietly missing the sprint deliverables is significantly worse than if you had communicated upfront that the sprint wasn't achievable. The problem isn't the missed deadline, it's the lack of communication.\n\nDeadlines really aren't a SWE's problem. They're a management problem. When deadlines are at risk, management has the power to dial back scope, increase resources, or adjust the deadline. That's project management 101, it's stuff that PM interns know. What us as the SWE's are responsible for is *communicating* when those deadlines are at risk, and aren't acheivable. Our job is communicating the *actual* time to delivery. So when you're given an amount of work that can't be reached by the deadline, *communicate that*. Then your management can do *their* job, and manage that deadline.",

You need to get used to estimations being wrong and telling the lead/PM/whoever as soon as you realize it so that everyone can re-prioritize.\n\nFor agile to be done correctly people need to be honest (to themselves and the team) about how much work they can realistically take on.

It could be 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week or 1 month depending on how unknown the task it and what other fires you need to put out in-between the task. Secondly they don't know how fast you are, they don't know how well onboarded you are etc. so there's a lot of unknown. They of course don't want to give you less work than you can take im because they need your pipeline filled and you familiarized and productive asap. So the other comments already say what you need to do but I wanted to contextualize a bit.",

Contribute to open source projects, build side projects with modern tech stacks, or take on freelance work to expand your experience. Document everything you learn and build a portfolio that demonstrates growth beyond your current role.\n\nA service like Applyre can help you explore opportunities while staying employed. With your experience level, you should be targeting roles in the 100-120k range, especially if you can demonstrate modern frameworks and practices through personal projects.\n\nYour current setup isn't sustainable for long-term career growth. Those 2-3 wasted days per sprint add up to months of lost development time annually. Use this downtime strategically to skill up, then leverage that new knowledge to land a more challenging role.

Each product manager has a different set of skills. Each product demands a different set of skills.\n\nThere is inwards and outwards focused parts of the job. I've seen plenty of introverted product managers so long as you can still articulate and do the coordination part of the role, not every product manager is the energy spewer.\n\nYou can understand whether you will succeed in product management by the views you take on things as a developer. How much you prioritise the business goals over the technical goals (etc, etc).\n\nDo you feel comfortable taking what the team is telling you and communicating that to leadership (spending time on powerpoint, and project management software to communicate this). Do feel comfortable interpreting and communicating changing demands from the leadership to the team?\n\nI will regularly talk about what I don't know and the path gaining that knowledge. Having said that tools like NotebookLM and equivalent have made it much easier to become a rapid expert on a given subject.\n\nGaps in CVs depend heavily on how you sell it. Selling it as T shaped individual is an amazing way to make yourself look better not worse. I've taken large amounts of time off and live a fairly unorthodox life (nomadic) and if anything it's helped my career rather than hindered it. I'm seen as a little bit crazy and edgy and that helps break preconceptions.\n\nThings like taking up sailing or other activities can be a great way of demonstrating that you have depth. Writing and art are both things that are very shareable and show passion. Being an amazing writer can be a great way of enhancing your (introvert focused) communication.\n\nLong and short though is that I wouldn't lie at all. I would definitely take everything you believe about yourself and spin it to explain why that would make you a good product manager. Every development experience that exposed you to good and bad product management. Every time you stepped in to wear that hat.\n\nI'm expecting there to be a real hybridization of some of these roles anyway over the next few years with the increasing impact of AI, so enhancing your skills on this side is a wise move regardless of whether you become a fulltime product manager.",

That intellectual honesty built more trust than any amount of confident bullshitting ever could. \n\nYour dev background gives you a massive advantage because you actually understand what's possible and what's painful to build, which is surprisingly rare. Own that art/writing gap. It shows you think differently and have a broader perspective on user experience and storytelling, both crucial for PM work. \n\nThe buzzword thing is spot-on; the best PMs translate complex ideas into simple language that engineers, designers, and executives all understand differently. If you want to level up your PM knowledge systematically, Product Alliance has some of the most comprehensive interview prep and frameworks I've seen. Their modules cover everything from product sense to execution and they're particularly strong on teaching you how to structure your thinking without relying on empty jargon. \n\nDon't fake being someone else.

That is a way to make the WFH day worse than an office day.\n* Wake up at the same time as you would going to the office. It's tempting to wake up at like 9 AM. Don't.\n* Hooray! You have just freed up a block of time you can use to do whatever you want instead of walking to the office and sitting in a bus. I usually use it to start my morning slow. I wake up, go take a shower, put on fresh clothes, go prepare a real breakfast, and then eventually get to work. No rush. I am trying to wake up a little easier and actually fit more into this. Like, if I am able to get up earlier than usual on the WFH days, I could probably get the right temperature for a quick run and bike ride before the usual routine.\n* I have time flexibility. If I wake up early and I don't feel like doing the full morning routine, I just do a minimal one, get to work early, and call it a day early. The only requirement we have for WFH days is that there are two small blocks of time (1-2 hours each) where you **must** be available to answer a call. As long as you are available to answer a call during those two blocks, nobody really cares how you organize your time.\n* Set boundaries with extreme precision. It's very easy both to overwork yourself and work through your lunch break, and do the opposite - just go do something else and take an extra long break that ends up biting you. I try to use timers and alarms.\n* If possible, I try to get out of the house right after work. Quick walk, going to some event or gathering with friends, run some errands, etc. I find it's beneficial if you \"simulate\" the same separation rituals you get from an office day, except they are not time completely thrown into the garbage, but time slots for things that are good for you, or tasks that you should make anyway.\n\nExtra goated golden bonus tip:\n\n* If I want to take a break, instead of just going to get a coffee and use my phone or talk to people a bit as I'd do in the office, I do a quick errands break. Like, I do a part of an house chore I need to make. Load up and unload the dishwasher, clean the kitchen, something like that. This has two benefits: 1) it keeps you active and away from your screen, which is the best way to get a break. 2), when done consistently, it frees up a surprising amount of free time. So, after you work, you have to do less errands and you have more **really** free time",

All the information you need is available online for absolutely free, you can also pay for some relatively cheap books to help.  System design is well written about and a lot of free content you can find to fill that gap. System design isn't even taught in most CS programs so if you're expecting that from a CS degree you'll be left wondering why they graduate students with so little system design knowledge.  Most CS programs focus on theoretical foundations and DSA all of which you can learn for free online.",

Totally get where you're coming from :') The jump from bootcamp to senior-level system design can feel pretty overwhelming, especially when you're in meetings and people start throwing around complex algorithms and architectural patterns like its nothing.\n\nYou're right that there's a gap between what most bootcamps teach and the deeper CS fundamentals needed for system design. At Metana, we've definitely seen this progression, people who get comfortable with their first language but then hit a wall when it comes to designing scalable systems.\n\nThe thing is, you don't need to go back to school for a full degree. You just need the right fundamentals,  algorithms, data structures, distributed systems concepts, and database design. Most of the 'scary math' conversations are honestly just people showing off half the time.\n\nAlso worth considering, maybe look into some of the more intensive programs that bridge this gap? There are options between bootcamps and full degrees that focus specifically on systems and architecture for working developers. Way more practical than starting from scratch with calculus and discrete math.\n\nYou've got 5 years of experience and domain knowledge, that's actually pretty valuable. You just need to fill in the CS theory gaps, not rebuild everything from ground up.",

There are various sorts of \"systems design interview prep\" resources you can look into, and that might help you participate in the conversations you run into.\n\nLike many things in this field though, that all barely scratches the surface and there's a lot to learn by just being in the trenches.

I dont regret the money I made but I somewhat regret jumping ship due to mental breakdown.\n\nIM not saying the new job will suck but sometimes there is a thing about staying at a company that treats you well even if the work slows down a bit. It happens in many companies it's on you to decide whether it's worth it or not. \n\nFor 136k base pay vs 150k base pay and the options you are getting, id stay at the job. Im sure it's getting boring but you know the work, you have more job security, the people likely love you. You get 2 fridays off a month (i've done 9/80 and I love it and wish I could go back to it). \n\nI dont like including bonuses as part of pay because they are not guaranteed and it's just used as a way to get you there. So really consider it as you only make an extra 14k. Is 14k worth travelling 4 hours, having to work 5 days a week every week, potentially losing work-life balance (this is a big one), etc. \n\nAt your job I know it'sa bout 22% bonus, that's amazing, you are likely more guaranteed to get that 22% at your current job than your new job because they will take into account the years you have put in good work where the new job wont give you 30% the first year because the first year they likely are hoping you catch up. Theyll give you enough to be happy but I doubt it will be 30% and who knows how much they give you in followin gyears. I was told when I moved companies that Id get 10% raises and 20% bonuses almost every year. In year 1, they decided to not give raises to anybody due to market. Usually companies that give amazing bonuses are the first to give no bonuses on a down year.",

Networking is very simply *making friends*. Forming genuine relationships with people.\n\nIt's not forming fake relationships where the sole purpose you're speaking is to use them to get you a job.\n\nTech meetups are common suggestions for \"networking\", but that's not because it's a place people go to connect on LinkedIn. It's because it's a place where people that all have a shared interest go to do that shared interest together. When you do that, you *make friends* with those people. When they're your friends, they're now in your network.\n\nYou could go to a rock climbing meetup and it would have the exact same effect. You could go to your local dive bar and make friends with John Doe over a night of heavy drinking. It doesn't matter if John Doe is in tech or not, all that matters is that John Doe *has a job*. Anyone at a company can refer people to any position. Even if John's in sales, his company is likely hiring SWE's, and he'll be happy to refer a *genuine friend*.\n\nIt's not something that really happens overnight, forming a network takes time.

However, big tech companies might worry about your code quality, collaboration skills, and knowledge of industry best practices since you've been working solo. The key is being upfront about what you know and what you're eager to learn, rather than trying to oversell your experience.\n\nYou're not really overqualified for mid-level positions - you're differently qualified, which can work in your favor if you frame it right. Focus on the problem-solving aspects, the full ownership you've taken of projects, and your ability to work independently, but also emphasize your excitement about learning team dynamics and industry standards. Many companies actually love hiring PhD holders because you bring analytical thinking and persistence that's hard to teach. The trick is convincing them in interviews that you can adapt to their environment and that your unconventional path is an asset, not a liability. I'm on the team that built [interview copilot AI](http://interviews.chat) to help navigate those tricky \"explain your background\" questions that can make a huge difference in landing the right role.",

Keep a brag / conflict document\n\nA work log is essentially for writing down what you do day to day, conversations you have, context you gather, and anything and everything so you can look back and see your growth over time\n\nA brag / conflict document is two fold: Writing down big accomplishments that you'd brag about, and a conflict document is any issues that arise like bugs you introduce, conflicts with your manager or peers, etc. \n\nAll of these will help you craft your resume in the future, and help you remember context for when you go to interview. It's a lot easier to look back and brush up on what happened during that huge project than go \"uhhhh yeah i built the thing over time and people were happy\".\n\nCongrats and good luck!",

        "body": "Congrats.\n\nYour first week is usually onboarding., depending on company you either talk to your manager to decide how you're first few weeks will look like or you take an onboarding course. It varies by company. But in the end there should be an onboarding of how to build, test, etc.\n\nBefore any of that, your first day will likely be signing up for benefits (insurances), payroll, etc. This shoudl be the absolute first thing you do so you get your money in the bank and not through a check mailed to you.\n\nGet your W-4 completed (takes like 5 minutes tops). Im not a financial adviser in any way but if you get RSUs, i'd suggest having them take a certain amount extra per check to account for the RSUs when you start to get them. I got burned by this the fist time I got RSUs. Because tehy are considered bonus they are taxed differently so I ended up owing a good amount to the IRS my first year. Ideally I try to have them take 100 per check to account for that.\n\nSign up for any 401k accounts too. Your future self will thank you later. Put as much as you think is fair, experts suggest 12-15% a year.\n\nAs for the job. Your first week is usually onboarding and then you get small tasks and build up confidence in the code. Ask your manager when he expects you to start getting bigger tasks. If he/she says in 3 months, try to get ahead of everything. If they say that the first week they only expect you to run tests and build, try to get that doen within the first few days and then by thursday tell them you are done and if you can at least look at the first task to get an idea of where to start.\n\nAsk questions, dont be afraid to reach out to people. it's scary at first but passive devs are the ones that get booted. If you start doing it before your manager has to say it, your manager will thank you. Managers have so much on their plate so they love devs who they dont ahve to say anything to, they just trust the dev will always be ahead of the pack. So if your manager is hoping to get you a task after 3 months, try to be ready at the 2nd month. Better to have him tell you to slow down then having to tell you to hurry up.\n\n  \nEdit: also just to add. To emphasive the dont be a passive dev, report what you do. You have to play a game to a certain level. I once had a seniro dev tell me that it is better to do 2 tasks and report it during stand up and create dialogue about it (take ove rthe screen and show results for example, ask questions about being stuck, etc) than it is to do 10 tasks and just make simple 1 comment about progress that doesnt create discussion. Being stuck on the same task that should've taken a few days, but you are just stuck for weeks and dont say anything in stand up is a huge turnoff. \n\nAlso find a mentor or senior friend you can do work with at a certain point. Someone who will hype you up to the manager and you can work along side with. At a certain point if you can be the guy who gets name-called during stand up, that's a plus. Even in meetings wher eyou are not there. Im talking about when someone has a report and they say \"OP helped me get past this issue\" or \"OP made an interesting observation\" at a certain point someone is going to say \"wow OP is making good contributions\" and someone might be like \"who is this OP everybody is talking about\".",

Let's be honest, most of us have days even weeks where we arent our most proactive especially in this career.

Managers know it happens and try to combat that which is why they like when employees try to make up the time doing other things. So maybe if this happens again, bring it up to the manager like \"hey her transfer is taking longer than expected. Any other options I can do to get mine's done if not, what work can I pick up?\"",

If done regularly, it wouldnt take more than 20 minutes to get the CD, transfer it go through protocols and put it in the secure network. But if you let it add up, it would exponentially be slower and slower. \n\nOne time we had to transfer some major data coming in from an even higher network that was barely used but people started to use it more as the project was winding down. We realized that the higher network just was never updated so we had to routinely update it with huge transfers. I put the CD in, it took me half days work to do it. Thankfully one of the Product owners ntocied in the first week it was taking me forever so he told me he had a secure hard drive that I could use whenever I needed to transfer huge data and it cut my time down by so much.\n\n  \nAgain take it as a learning lesson. I've done your same mistake before of not asking on day 1, it's something I am trying to improve to because if you keep pushing it back then it's day 10 and you still have made no progress.

That time you spent hours debugging a segmentation fault, or when you had to figure out why your algorithm was timing out on edge cases, or even when you struggled to understand a complex concept and had to try multiple approaches before it clicked - these are all valid technical challenges that demonstrate problem-solving skills.\n\nThe key is to structure your answer around the process rather than the complexity of the problem itself. Pick something where you can clearly explain what went wrong, what steps you took to diagnose and solve it, what you learned, and how it made you a better developer. Maybe it was implementing a data structure from scratch, debugging a tricky race condition in a multithreaded program, or optimizing a slow database query.

I was likely in line for a promotion to senior in year 5, and if i stayed id likely be a higher level senior or a lower level principal by now. But my pay wouldnt be anything crazy. \n\nI left during the hiring boom of 2022. Got into faang. Spent 3 years there. My work life balance took a hit. I was working 10+ hour days, always catching up. Tbh, i didnt feelnlike i was growing at all there. Felt like there was an unspoken rule to always be available, always do more, always be in meetings and then theyd be shocked when you didnt have alot of work done. \n\nI got laid off and honestly i didnt miss it at all. Got a job after 3 months in big tech, but not faang and now i make more for less work and stress. Benefits arent as amazing but still really good. \n\nIm not trying to steer you away from that as im sure there are examples where people found the perfect job. But i will say really look to find aomething that will fit your needs and what you expect for work. Dont just look at the money, or  how cool the project is.",

If you have a PhD in Physics, you don't want to apply for jobs that are going to emphasize things you cannot bring to the table. So you don't want to apply for jobs where they're going to be looking for you to be a shallow generalist or a specialist in something you don't do.\n\nThis is the trap people fall into - they see 500 jobs that they could technically do and apply to all of them.\n\nInstead, you want to focus on applying to the jobs where not only can someone with your background be successful, but really where almost only people with your type of background can be successful. \n\nGenerally speaking, that is going to be companies working on solving things that aren't fully solved. Some people will call this R&D or research or innovation, but at its core you want to look for things that are not just standard, off-the-shelf solutions.\n\nWhat you want to avoid is generic \"entry level data scientist for Fortune 500 company training ML models\".\n\nNow, what can you do to enhance your resume:\n\n1. Make sure you cram Python hard. C++, C#, Java are all good too, and there might be some niche industries where other languages are relevant, but if you're blindly going to pick one, it needs to be Python, and you want to be able to show up as a very strong Python coder. \n\n2. Make sure you cram SQL. It's not as critical as it once was, but you still need to make sure you are fairly competent with SQL: select, group by, inner/left/full/right joins, partition by/window functions, nested queries, and CTEs.\n\n3. Assuming you're looking into AI/ML: make sure you learn about/brush up on as many of the basics of ML: regression, classification, clustering, A/B testing, NLP. \n\n4. If you want to go for maximum marketability and you have the time/ability to do so: either a) dive into some of the \"under the hood\" LLM stuff, or b) learn how to build LLM-powered applications. There's no easier path to getting a high paying job right now than being able to contribute to LLM stuff. And realistically, it's a new enough field that there should be plenty of room for someone with a Physics PhD to find an area within it where you can get yourself up to speed and be dangerous.",

Positions such as senoir data science frequently have hiring managers or recruiters who only look for experience in industry in the exact right platforms and tools and dont consider anything in terms of applicable skill.\n\nSomeone with a PhD isn't normally going to go straight to a Senior role unless their research experience is directly relevant to a specific industry.\n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't be looking for Senior roles - I would be looking for entry level roles in highly competitive industries. Like, a Senior Data Scientist at some middle tier tech company is probably making less money than an entry level data scientist at a hedge fund, top tier tech company, cutting edge startup with lots of money, etc.\n\nSo again, don't think \"well, I'm smart enough to be able to do something as well as a more senior data scientist who *doesnt'* have a PhD\", because not only is that not right (experience in industry matters), but also hiring managers won't agree with you.\n\nInstead, I would look for jobs where you can say \"typical entry-level data scientist with a BS in CS could not handle this\", and those are the jobs you want to apply for. I think startups would also be a good place for someone like you vs. mega dino tech companies (and I say this as someone who works in a mega dino tech company).\n\n>Also, to be sure, what does llm powered application mean ? Does that mean how to work with and guide and direct llms to build and put together coding scripts and libraries with which to build apps ?\n\nThat means a piece of software that uses API calls to an LLM provider (OpenAI, Claude, whatever) to do stuff. You're not actually making contributions to the underlying LLM model, you're making a piece of software that uses an existing model. There is a spectrum too - there's stuff like RAG systems where you're not retraining the model per se, but you're adapting the model for your own application with your own data.",

But it's during a tech recession (the \"wrong time\") which is something outside your control.\n\nYou can't exactly force yourself into an industry that is an employer's market right now. I'm sorry to say it but nobody is coming to save you with a life-changing piece of advice or a lucrative job offer out of the blue just because you've found your blockers. Over-intellectualizing it will make you feel worse about it without any actionable outcomes. But I also don't think your situation is as hopeless as you make yourself believe.\n\nIt's not a struggle unique to you, and people have successfully navigated themselves out of it by being patient. Read some posts from people who had to job-hunt during the dot-com crash or the 2008 financial crisis. Most of the competent ones made it out OK, but it took them a while to get there. It's not your fault, but it's also in your best interest to continue applying without any expectation for the next while throughout the recession cycle (which may take years, I understand).",

I've applied for 600+ jobs this past 5 months and got 4 interviews - half of them is not paid positions - which they kind of made fun of me trying to validate my internship experiences. Most of the time i thought ot myself 'its fine, maybe i can show off some of the passion projects I've been developing to the companies and maybe they'd hire me' but the field I worked on for these 3+ years by myself via passion projects didnt even made me get an interview on that specific field. It is a tiring, exhausting process but i still apply with hope in my heart to see if i can land a job which might get me out of these paradoxes in 2-3 years. Sad part is, that i've given up on the field i raised myself in. It is really tough man, sometimes i wish i would've been a little bit older so that i could've graduated before pandemic.\nGood luck to both of us, hope you wont get exhausted as much as i did.",

You could take it and negotiate the raise later from a position of already doing the job well. Being in a consultative role also develops valuable skills that can be applied anywhere.\n\nFor Option 2, I'd be direct about asking the startup some hard questions: What's their runway looking like? How many months of operating capital do they have without additional funding? Profit sharing sounds nice, but startups often don't reach profitability for years. With 80% of startups failing, you want to know if you'd be joining during a stable period or right before a cash crunch.\n\nThe hybrid requirement after a year is also worth digging into. Is this flexible if you're performing well? Often, these policies are more flexible than initially stated.\n\nIf stability is a priority right now, Option 1 with your existing company offers that while still providing growth opportunities. If you're willing to take on more risk for potentially higher rewards, Option 2 could be a great choice. Just make sure to verify their financial stability first.",

So a CS can easily do a CEs job as the learning curve isnt as crazy and most embedded systems are being coded in C++, but a CE has a harder transition into more CS roles because we were never taught the full Software process.

I think we're leaning towards the SWEs doing their own testing part of the cycle at the moment because people are being pushed to wear multiple hats with the job market as it is\n\n\\* Having QA-related roles on your resume can be very polarizing. Some managers believe that to be a huge plus, especially if you ever go back to SWE, because that indicates that you will test your own code along the way, and take testing into consideration when you plan anything. Others think that a SDET/SET is unable to code as well since they do QA along with other work. It's hard to say.  \n\n\n\\* One more thing that comes to mind is that most places that have dedicated QA generally operate on inflexible timelines. If you're burning out, having those kind of hard deadlines (which can be hard to meet due to a whole host of reasons) might not be as pleasant as you expect.\n\n\n\nAll that being said, and noting that a lot of that sounds negative, I personally enjoy it. Places that value quality will value the fact that you're bringing in perspective about testing that is often overlooked, especially when you're bringing these discussions to the table early instead of as an afterthought. \n\nI have been seeing some roles pop up on LinkedIn and otherwise, so I'd like to believe that as hiring picks up more of those roles will open up as companies flow back to having to build up quality around projects that have had minimal testing..",

You might just be trading one set of responsibilities for another.\n\nQA automation is definitely growing, especially with the shift toward CI/CD and DevOps practices. But the day-to-day can still involve a lot of hand-holding with manual testers and coordinating with dev teams. The technical challenges are different but the leadership expectations often remain.\n\nHave you considered more specialized SWE roles that might reduce the people management aspect? Like backend-focused positions, DevOps engineering, or even transitioning into a more technical architect role where you're solving problems without direct team management?\n\nAt Metana, we see a lot of mid career folks looking for these kinds of pivots.

See if youc an try to fix the core issues so you're not getting hammered (or creating tickets and advocating your manager for people to work on it). Some pages tend to also just be noise, do you get a lot of pages that people say to just ignore?

So what theyd do is there was about different teams for every product in the project. My team had about 30-40 people in the US and about the saem in India and it rotated betrween each person. So I had to be on-call for aabout 12 hours once a month. At first it sucked because we had no automation at the time so every issue was hard to find and any customer issue had to get on a call with the customer for a few hours. It sucked. But then automation got better and dropped the amount of customer calls because issues were getting resolved before the customer realized it. Usually the issues in this on-call were onest that had to be resolved immediately.\n\nThere was a 2nd on-call that lasted 3-4 days, this was for less serious issues that could wait a couple days to resolve. But people in this on0-call would get a lot because it was mostly minor issues. \n\nMy current job, does weekly on-call but from what I hear we will get all types of incidents. But it's mostly to be owrked on during business hours unless it's a tier 1 issue which has to be worked on immediately. Thankfully my team is last line of defense so it's rare to hear that happen.",

Title aint shit without the money.\n\nI had a similar situation: I was hoping for staff engineer, but got a senior offer. I was up front from the beginning about my interest in the staff position: I think it's important to lay the groundwork early - if you go through everything at one level and suddenly ask for the higher, that won't go over well. Then later, at the offer stage when we talked about senior, I was clear \"Hey I started looking at these because of the salary band of this higher level - can we meet in the middle somewhere?\"\n\nThere are obviously no guarantees, but that's how I played it.

Think advanced stochastic theory, measure theory, etc.\n\nIf you want to be.in the camp of majority of people here / software engineers that want to be implementing, building, or having sufficient conceptual knowledge around AI / ML - then you can get it from any combination of uni, self study, work and practical experience.\n\nMost unis offering these programs are masters by coursework. Some might have a small thesis component or project at the end. A masters by coursework is just units/subjects similar to your undergraduate. Most people take them to shift into a new field. A master by research is for those considering dipping their toes in research - effectively \"create new body of knowledge and how to build on others research\". It's more likely for someone to upgrade their masters by research to a PhD. They are two different purposes.\n\nFor your situation - \n\nYou could consider a masters coursework and supplement it with practical experience and self study. \n\nThe industry moves fast and you still won't learn things that people talk about now that trendy like mcp, ai agents, LLM, rag, all those tools people talk about like cursor / Claude etc.  These are just implementations / practical applications and they will change quick, some will be adopted and accepted and other dropped.\n\nThe masters program would be useful if you need a planned study program and if you wanted theoretical foundation that underpin AI  (provided the uni program unit) such as statistical learning, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning Bayesian theory... How hopfield neutral networks work , Monte Carlo etc work. Remember ML / AI is actually intersection of CS and Maths. So when you pick a uni program, make sure it has a balance of CS and Stats.

No University can honestly make a curriculum on it without being a fraud.\n\nBy the time you study it deeeeeeep on Google, watch conferences and other stuff and really practice working with it, you will already have more EXPERIENCE with AI and ML than a Masters could ever get you, you will likely have a few projects, be able to get a job and be free of a student loan.\n\nNot that many places care about a Masters degree anymore. Only that you have a Bachelor's. Most super tech places are more interested in your skills and projects.\n\nPlease, save yourself while you can.",

Are new masters graduates who actually like doing ML getting jobs? Absolutely. They do need to be from a \"top\" university, however. (PhD hiring is, as ever, less prestige-obsessed, but it's still pretty bad.)\n\n\nThe tricky part for you is your level of experience. The typical ML masters new grad has 0-2 years of experience and should expect to be busted down to entry level. You should expect that, too, just with a faster promotion path. Whether that's acceptable to you is a different question.",
