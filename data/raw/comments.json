Well, yeah, that's a solution that is pretty much guaranteed to cause a ton of DQ problems.  As opposed to having the source system publish domain objects that are locked down with data contracts.\n   * Data engineers build almost no quality-control tests, no unit testing, no reconciliation checks, no anomaly-detection, and no field transform audits to track changes over time.  dbt and great expectations are generally poor tooling that only address a fraction of this.\n   * Product managers, given zero push from engineering, leave out all considerations of data quality - no SLOs, no dashboards, no investment.  Which means it falls 100% on the engineer's heads.\n\nIt doesn't have to be that way.  But data engineers need to be better informed about DQ and push hard for architectures, tools, and processes they need.",

The way they do so is perfect for them.\n\nMarketing want a single customer view. Neither line of business collect the data in a form that allows comparison. You now have a data quality problem.\n\nThe only way I have found to improve the data quality is to fix it at source. You do this by making the down stream data vital to the earnings of both lines of business.  Customers get pissed off because, as far as they are concerned they are buying from company X. They couldn't give 2 hoots for the fact they bought product line A which is different from product line B. \nAs customer retention is far easier than customer recruitment,  anything that looses customers is very much frowned upon.",

And no we cannot bring on help at this time. And no I cannot put new work on hold because I (the boss) cannot say no.\n\n\\- Everything is fine, your other team mates (who are work-a-holics) are meeting deadlines, why are you complaining.\n\n\\- A general lack of boundaries by your boss, management, or team mates to say it can wait til tomorrow for stuff that legitimately is not critical\n\nI have some or all of the above at all of my jobs. When you have a boss who won't advocate for the team it really makes everything bad. At my one job (a 200 head count startup) I was getting calls from the CTO at 8 PM at night to ask about what filters we were using for our SMS notifications. Mind you, the SMS notification job ran at 3 PM. He could have just asked me the next morning in the office. The problem is once you give into this type of nonsense it is hard to get people to back off and respect your boundaries.\n\nI now have a job with a great boss that sets clear boundaries. Maybe once in 4 years have I had an emergency call while on PTO or during off hours. And in this case it was a legitimate emergency and I was given extra time off to compensate. Sometimes we still fall into the \"get it out the door we'll fix problems later\" cycle, but at least my current boss sets some sprints aside to eventually address these issues.\n\ntldr: sounds like your company has management problems and doesn't respect boundaries. Unfortunately you either have to deal with it or probably find somewhere else.",

One guy made it his annual goal last year to \"increase AI use in our company by 50%\". He did not achieve that goal, in part because it's difficult to measure an increase when you have no real base data.\n\nThey are using AI as a buzzword and a way to make themselves appear like they're \"with it\". It's easy to say \"I'm going to help facilitate AI infrastructure growth\" or \"expand AI use\", but then what?\n\nI think AI is oversaturated. We had several different teams working on projects that were supposed to integrate our company data with ChatGPT (i.e. allowing business users to query company data) and then ChatGPT came out with a \"Company Knowledge\" feature (like 2 weeks ago) and all those teams are now looking for new projects to work on, but they wasted what I can only assume is months of development hours that the company paid for. This is not an isolated incident at my company - there are tons of AI projects with no real end goal other than \"enabling AI across the organization\".\n\nIt's just crazy to me how many people at my company are working on AI projects, but don't really have any demand for these projects (at my company specifically).",

While I am kept busy full time, we don't need a full time network or system engineers, or cyber security experts. We also don't have the physical space for a server room. We don't need computer power 24/7.\n\nAs for the platforms, there's more setup and engineering work to get those going and patched constantly. I'm a heavy user of Databricks. I could put together something similar with Spark, but that would basically double my workload so we'd end up needing an extra engineer.\n\nCloud lets us offload all the physical infrastructure and maintenance, and the associated labour. It lets us pay for the compute power we need, which is a lot less than a full server which would spend most of its time idle.",

I say may because a change could result in a new table being created that you don't have - that now accounts for some of the data you were previously seeing.  Anomaly-detection could also help.  \n   * But there'll be outages as you're surprised & scrambling to solve the problem.\n\nWith Data Contracts:\n\n   * You have a *shared* contract for what the data being published needs to look like\n   * The publisher can test data against it before they make any changes\n   * You can compare data you receive to it, and if it fails, just open a ticket/whatever for the source team to fix their shit.\n   * Life is good",

In a feed of taxi-cab journeys, how many \"journeys\" have zero duration, or recorded milage over 100,000 miles? If you divide milage by duration, is the computed average speed faster than the speed of light? All of these are clear and suggestive of bad data quality and can be used to shame whatever upstream system is generating this content, and to pro-actively warn anyone consuming your feed downstream. You don't necessarily have to do anything about these \"implausible\" data items, just provide a reckoning of them. Somebody in the business needs to own these, and making them super-transparent is one way to nudge someone into taking responsibility - whilst also showing you've done your part as part of a team that respects quality.",

Domain knowledge will improve as you work longer in that field. \n\nFocus on learning and get stronger at SQL which is the first and most important skill to have at the core of any data role. Then pickup data modeling which is the hardest skill to obtain, many at senior levels fail that round. Sometimes, can only come with experience. Then onto distributed compute and storage. At last, python and cloud skills. Don't focus on tools, rather focus on the fundamental concepts, processes, standards and conventions are important for sustainable career.\n\nOnce you have the above, those can be applied to any domain since your base is very strong. Might take sometime to pickup domain knowledge but that can be learned quickly from the current employees of the company you're working at. \n\nI'm currently working as a data modeler for an automotive company. Never worked for this domain but my modeling skills are good, I ask lot of questions during KT sessions which helps me to design scalable and sustainable data model.

You don't control prioritization. \n\nStart logging off on weekends/nights unless you're explicitly on call to support a very important thing. It can usually wait until you're back in the office. Most deadlines are made up. Some aren't (Legal/Regulatory/Things that directly cost or make money), but most things aren't in those categories.

And DE is also applicable to situations that aren't BI. \n\nAnd BI is more than just DE, as you've observed - choosing how to model the data uniformly, for example, isn't really DE (IMO), although many data engineers also know a lot about data modelling.\n\nA platform that does all this stuff is traditionally called a data warehouse - and these days, that can encompass things that aren't strictly a data warehouse in a micro sense, but could still be described as a data warehouse in a macro sense. (Very little terminology in this area has really super-precise definitions that everyone agrees on.)\n\nNormalisation is actually not necessarily the way to go at all, for data you want to use for analytic purposes (\"making sense of data\"). _De_normalisation is often more appropriate. This is a huge discussion area within data modelling: a great place to start IMO is the book \"The Data Warehouse Toolkit\" by Kimball and Ross. Get the 3rd edition. This is not just a random book rec, it's a really foundational text in this field, covering \"dimensional data modelling\" aka \"star schemas\"\n Not everyone agrees with it but I don't think anyone should be critiquing it without having read it.\n\nIn terms of tooling and platforms, you can build your own stack using tools (often open source) that each focus on one smaller thing, doing it well; or there are big enterprise offerings that aim to provide everything you need in one package. Databricks and MS Fabric are two of those that get discussed quite a lot.\n\nWe settled on MS Fabric for my org (mainly my choice) and it's been a huge success for us.

        "body": "Analytics consulting firm for 10 years here.\n\nI've seen many many companies and very few ever get there.\n\nTrends I've seen:\n\n* Product-led companies, think SaaS (B2B and B2C), have been thinking about their data architecture since day 1 and are more likely to mature this effort faster and the most likely to get there. And it is because most of their business systems are built by software engineers.\n   * Sometimes they mature and separate the marketing/acquisition teams from the product teams and that is usually the death knell for centralizing product and marketing data.\n* That leads me to marketing data. It is usually the lowest requirement on the totem pole and at the same time it is the most difficult to deal with - it needs the most modeling, it doesn't ever rationalize (compared to accounting data), and its systems and tactics change the fastest. Almost no one ever gets this properly centralized/joined/productionized.\n* Sales-led companies (particularly the ones that don't have a digital product) revolve around the CRM (as they should, it is the *sales* system in a *sales-led* organization). Parallel efforts to pull data out of the CRM and join with other business systems are competitive for dollars and brainpower of decision makers. It is easier to build out the functionality of the CRM (apps and integrations) than it is to build out the data practice in the org outside the CRM.\n* In ecommerce of the last 6-7 years there has been trend toward Customer Data Platform, which I see as directly competitive to data warehouse. I have never met a company that said \"we are soooo glad we invested in that CDP\". Most never get fully integrated. Once they do, they realize that in order to automate reactions to customer behaviors, they need to understand customer behaviors, which is what they would have gotten if they'd invested in analysis of the data rather than orchestration.",

There were always people suggesting “just use this, just use that”, but the reality is that there’s just way too many ways how the input data can look like, so it’s impossible to slap a generic solution on top. We ingest from actual databases, web APIs, tons of Excel sheets with different encoding/separators, etc. We push for standardisation, but it’s an uphill battle.\n\nThe best we can do is minimise the custom code and rely on libraries as much as possible, but often it is simpler to write code from scratch than to overcome obscure bugs/limitations in said libraries.\n\nWe use Airflow for orchestration, but even that was heavily customised in terms of how DAGs are deployed.",

You can then make changes to the query, add indexes etc, and compare the info. I used to get such a kick from reducing a humungous query taking 10 mins to run and doing millions of logical I/Os to e.g 3 seconds and 1% of the original logical I/O.\n\nAs a rule, the quicker you can limit how much is being read and computed, the better a query will perform. So if i am joining millions of rows to millions of rows and THEN filtering or aggregating, that is going to require a lot more reads and memory. If i can filter the incoming data first or aggregate it, then do my joins, it will run much sweeter.",

SSIS can handle on‑prem migrations, but you’ll write more glue and own the failure modes. If you stick with SSIS: use the SSIS Catalog (project model), environment variables, SQL Agent with retries/alerts, CDC components, bulk-load to staging then MERGE, and a metadata-driven pattern (BIML helps). I’ve used Informatica and Talend for this; we also used DreamFactory to expose legacy DBs as REST so apps stayed decoupled during cutover.

If the scale of your customer's data is not huge (< 1bn records in a data set) using your cloud object store, whether s3, azure, or gcp, with mother duck as the query engine could be an excellent, low-cost choice. Since MotherDuck rolled out support for the DuckLake lake house format (and DuckDB recently introduced white support for iceberg tables), this might fulfill your catalog needs as well. \n\n\nIf you really need a rich ontology of your data rather than a simple data catalog, you might want to check out some data virtualization options such as star dog. Ontologies come with a ton of additional complexity, and you will be more restricted in where you can store your data / what formats are supported, so I would recommend avoiding the ontology route unless it truly is a critical part of your business. \n\n\nIf you need to support very large scale, I would look for options that have a serverless pricing model available and incorporating that into your own customer billing. I have used bigquery to support a multi-tenant product in the past, and I was very happy with the experience.",

This is where the magic happens: you can apply labels to these pods: dag\\_id, task\\_id, and most importantly, customer\\_id. Then you just go into GCP's native billing, which can group costs by those labels, and you can see exactly how much a specific DAG for a specific customer is costing you, down to the penny\n\n  \nBut if a full migration to Kubernetes is too much, there's a \"good enough\" method. Instead of tracking dollars, track resource-hours. Airflow logs the duration of every task. If your workers are a standard instance size (e.g., n2-standard-4), you can build a simple cost model: cost = duration\\_in\\_hours \\* cost\\_per\\_hour\\_of\\_worker. It's not perfect - you'll miss network and disk I/O - but it'll get you 80% of the answer for 20% of the effort and help you find your most expensive tasks",

If your Airflow workers are not dynamic or they use the same pools of compute for all tasks, having a tagging system that trickles up into GCP/AWS billing is likely not possible. \n\nHowever you can often tag individual 'task runs' of ECS/Cloud Run instances and have those trickle into billing natively. In my experience you do lose out on additional aspects like networking out, which can be substantial, and if you can't find a way to associate that you'd need a top level overhead you append onto each task or maybe by runtime. \n\nRegarding non-efficient tasks, what does that mean? Airflows native monitoring shows the Task Duration and Landing times. Perhaps also look at sensor runtimes to subtract from overall runs as they're 'efficient'.\n\nMy opinion would be that Airflow is a task orchestrator and attempting to patch in some sort of cost observability natively would not work well. Use the systems that are native to billing are the way to go. If your environment is stupid complex per tenant, we used to have terraform project creation to deploy tenant environments and then you can provide permissions for airflow to run compute/etc in those projects. Then you can track everything at the Project level and put them under a folder to ease IAM.",

(Ironically now we want to jam everything ino columnar store table file formats, that can partially trace to Vertica - Stonebreakers columnar OLAP db (fit for purpose)). \n\nThe core issue is that our infrastructure layer never evolved to make fit-for-purpose systems practical at scale. We know different workloads need different data structures, different storage engines, different consistency models. But the operational reality of managing multiple specialized systems, keeping them in sync, and reasoning about data flow across them remains prohibitively complex for most teams. State management is a big reason for this.\n\nSo we get stuck with pragmatic compromise. Teams choose Databricks or Snowflake or whatever and then bend their problems to fit the tool, because the alternative is managing a constellation of systems that might be technically superior, might better fit the different business needs, but is operationally untenable.\n\nThere is a ton of conceptual inertia in industry too. We think in terms of linear data flow: source to warehouse to consumption (ETL or ELT). But that framework doesn't naturally accommodate materialization into multiple fit-for-purpose targets. The tooling, the abstractions, the operational patterns are all built around central systems of record (BI, Analytics, Dashboards), not around dynamic materialization.\n\nThis is a key problem I'm working on. Until we have infrastructure that makes it trivial to materialize data into whatever shape and system the workload actually requires, without creating operational chaos, we'll keep defaulting to whatever single system we've already adopted, even when we know it's not right for half (or more) of what we're asking it to do.\n\nThe inertia isn't just conceptual. It's deeply structural.",

As soon as new line of work is discovered and identified, epic is created. Then modeling user stories where I work on creating data models starting from stage, raw vault, business vault (if needed) followed by information mart model (dims and facts), and views on top of IM objects. In stage, we establish the object and field naming convention and carry the same till the final end views. Now we have things in place for data lineage, meta data driven, scalable and sustainable data models in place. Every CDC goes through data model which is approved via GItHub PR, that helps with versioning, tracking audit ability and back tracking any changes. We also have master branches in Erwin model mart where we merge our approved model changes. \n\nEverything that I listed is barely practiced these days at many companies.

That would be a violation of Kimball's principles in this case. (Bridge tables are perfectly justified in some situations, but this isn't one of them.)\n\nSo within power query, you need to left join ProjectContribution to the source fact table, and do the multiplication to get the more granular, additive actual revenue numbers per contributor per project. You can then remove the % column (it's only semi-additive and can be calculated via a DAX measure). \n\nThat gives you your one, new, fact table, which you can then relate directly to the project dimension.

Fully Apache 2.0 licensed across all components.\n* **OpenMetadata** \\- similar feature set to DataHub. Backend is Apache 2.0, but UI/connectors use the Collate Community License (source-available with \"no competing SaaS\" restriction—can't offer it as a managed service).\n* **OpenLineage** \\+ **Marquez** \\- standardized lineage events, but you're building the metadata layer yourself. More pipeline-focused.\n\n**Orchestrator built-ins (dbt, Dagster, Airflow):** These track lineage *within their domain* but don't connect downstream to your actual reports/dashboards. You get table → table lineage but it dies at the data layer. No BI tool integration, no report ownership tracking.  \n  \n**Commercial:** Collibra, Atlan, Select Star, Monte Carlo - all have report lineage features. Expensive. Some have limited BI connectors or require their agents everywhere.  \n  \n**TL;DR:** If you want report → dataset → pipeline end-to-end lineage with ownership/KPIs attached, you need a proper catalog. DataHub if OSI-approved open source matters (procurement, contributions, full commercial freedom), OpenMetadata if the SaaS restriction doesn't affect you, commercial tools if you've got budget and specific BI tool needs.  \n  \nThe gap most orgs hit: their orchestrator shows them pipeline lineage, but nobody knows which dashboard broke when table X changed. That's the report lineage problem as you've identified.\n\nGood luck!",

The goal of the library isn’t to replace pandas, but to save people from rewriting the same pattern every time: extract the columns, modify them, and reindex. Functions like `swap_columns` or `move_after` just centralize that logic, handle bulk operations, validate inputs, and keep everything consistent so users don’t have to think about the mechanics each time.\n\nAbout `sort_columns`: yes, the pandas one-liner works perfectly. The value of having a single entry point is mostly convenience. You can switch between variance, std, mean, correlation, NaN-ratio, or a custom key without changing how you write the code. For some workflows that reduces friction; for others the built-in one-liners are already enough.\n\nAppreciate you taking the time to look at it and share your thoughts.",

        "body": "I've done this to subset data for micro-batches. It does work and you can create quite clean and comprehensive collected datasets with it, but there are caveats.\n\nFirst, if you have links between two entities of the same type (customer-customer) then you will need to recursively traverse this graph to make sure you get everything, otherwise some referential integrity or derivation can break. These links can themselves be derived links rather than explicit ones, so it isn't necessarily something you'll be able to pick out algorithmically right away. An example I had was that two customers could be linked via a shared account, but the relationship was in a generic customer-account table, and the account could appear multiple times. Pulling in a customer that wasn't initially selected could pull in *another* customer, because the third customer may be related to the second but not the first.\n\nSecond, you may end up with 'orphaned' data if you have you have some entity that is disjoint from your entry. Ideally this is not the case, but if you have multiple domains that don't directly interact you may end up just dropping an entire domain. Similar to the prior point, this is mostly something you'll find along the way, and you just need to give yourself an additional entry point.\n\nThird, you may have reference data that you don't want to filter in this way because certain outputs or reports may expect all reference data to be available regardless of whether anything relates to it. For example some classification reference set where someone does an aggregation group by that classification -- they may suddenly see classifications disappear entirely if no data was joined to it. They may prefer to still see the classification, but get `0` values in the aggregate data. Again, not something you can easily algorithmically determine, it is more of a UAT process on your data selection.\n\nThat said, this is afaik the only real feasible way to get a comprehensive random sample of the data at a given point in time. As long as you come up with an extensible and performant way to relate tables for key selection, to add extra entry points, to specify 'full copy' reference tables, and to specify 'loopbacks' on key selection, it is just a matter of configuring things.\n\nI am not aware of a 'standard practice' for this. People usually either just give up on referential integrity, or limit the time window and select everything rather than random sample.",

        "body": "I think you are right that data governance often grows out of other data domains like engineering or analytics. Companies usually learn the hard way why their engineering or analytics initiatives fail, and only then start thinking about governance. At first they try to handle it with existing people, and when it grows large enough they start hiring roles dedicated to it. In my experience this mostly happens in big regulated industries like banks, insurance companies or government. Small companies usually do not care much, and it is fine, because their scale rarely makes the problems severe, and a small team can still handle them. So yes, I would recommend looking at highly regulated areas like banking, insurance or the public sector. You will find more demand there.\n\nAs for entering data governance, it is a bit odd. From what I have seen, these roles are not the most sought after in data teams because they usually require less deep technical work. But this may only be true in organizations where the governance practice is already quite mature. Data skills still help a lot, and most places expect them in governance roles. Many organizations are still in the transition phase, where governance is mixed with regular data roles. It is still common to see a data engineer who is also a data steward at the same time while his job description might not actually indicate that.",

We have more people with the skills than customers willing to pay for those skills sadly...even though gdpr is a legal requirement. Gdpr has many facets and some are taken less serious than others and the serious ones are easy to implement with RLS and the likes.

For instance, in countries like Germany where the automobile industry is huge, companies are starting to take data governance seriously. But instead of hiring an entirely new team, they usually trust experienced internal people from engineering or analytics and hand those responsibilities over to them. Of course, they often have one dedicated person overseeing governance to guide the engineers, but that’s usually about it.\n\nWhat’s confusing, though, is that some industries seem to treat it differently. For example, Lufthansa recently started hiring specifically for data governance roles, which shows that aviation and other heavily regulated sectors are beginning to take it more seriously. So it feels like while in some industries it’s still considered a “risky zone” for newcomers, others are already investing in dedicated governance teams.",

I've seen everything, from organizations that have dedicated teams and resources for every part of it, to large organizations that have nothing in place and cannot even export data from an IT system to Excel.\n\nThat being said, very few organizations actually have it figured out. Because of that, roles inside data teams overlap a lot and people end up wearing many hats. So the recommendation to enter through any data role if you want to move toward governance is valid. It is often easier to pivot internally from analytics or engineering into governance or data management than to try to find a pure governance job from the outside.\n\nIt can also be risky. In some highly regulated organizations that are still immature, I have seen them hire data governance specialists before they even have data teams or a CDO. In those cases, the governance expert ends up sitting under legal or some other non data function. That is where it becomes ugly.",

No tool, Iceberg or otherwise, can magically guess that your name column is semantically equivalent to the first\\_name column in a new schema version. That's business logic that has to be codified somewhere. Iceberg solves for physical compatibility - it ensures you can still read old Parquet files after a schema update by tracking columns via internal IDs, not names, but it doesn't solve for logical compatibility - presenting a stable \"view\" of the data to your consumers. That's what a transformation layer, like dbt, is for. You land the messy, multi-version data in a \"raw\" Iceberg table, and then build a clean dbt view on top of it that uses logic like coalesce(first\\_name, name) to give your downstream systems a consistent, predictable schema. Iceberg is the foundation, but you still need to build the house",

It finally made sense when I came in on Monday after a weekend release and noticed an algorithm I had written (tree traversal, but that doesn't matter) had been rewritten to be less efficient by the chief architect. I was young and inexperienced and stormed in and demanded an explanation why they had \"regressed our performance\". He calmly explained the situation. To get the release out on Saturday night he had to modify the structure of the data slightly...in a way that was incompatible with my traversal. He had spent about half an hour trying to figure it out, writing unit tests to test the old and new structure...old passed, new didn't, the issue he was troubleshooting came down to the algorithm. It had no tests other than the ones he wrote. No comments explaining the reasoning behind it. It was not obvious to him why a convoluted and non standard algorithm was used. He had to fix it, and had to support it, so he did the reasonable thing and replaced it with a well known algorithm that worked with his new unit tests. Problem solved, release shipped.\n\nStarting to sympathize with the predicament he was in I explained my concern...the performance wasn't \"optimal\". \"'Optimal'? how do you know yours was 'optimal'?\" I stammered a bit and conceded I didn't actually know...but it \\*was\\* more efficient. \"Benchmarks?\" ....\"no...I never benchmarked it\". \"What cases does it work with\"....\"oh..this and that and the other....\". His response was \"how do you know?\".  \"I tested it!\" .....\"No...no you didn't. There were no tests. There are now. We know this works, when it works, and how it works.\" I responded indignantly \"but it's slower\". \"By a couple milliseconds, a few dozen times a day it runs. Do you care about that? Why? Isn't it better to know it works because it is tested with cases we expect it to handle?\"\n\n\"Yeah. If I write unit tests to fix the trivial issue with the original algorithm can I replace it?\" .... \"I guess you can....but is a few milliseconds of execution time a dozen times a day worth the effort? Don't you have actual bugs to fix?\" ....\"Yeah....\"....\"Then do it the next time you change that code\". It never had to change. I never put it back.\n\nIf I'd written unit tests showing the conditions the traversal handled, what it's preconditions were, etc he would have fixed the trivial issue with it and gone about his way, me none the wiser. Because I did a shoddy job it became his problem, and he fixed it the most expedient way possible...reasonable while the entire release team is twiddling their thumbs waiting for a critical fix.\n\nIf you don't unit test your code it doesn't really work. It \\*might\\* work. But you don't know that. You don't know what it is expected to handle. You don't know how its author was intending it to be used. I became an instant convert to unit testing after this. This happened in about 2004 before unit testing really became considered mandatory. I'm glad the industry has changed in this regard.",

Programming languages usually used for this purpose are so called \"high-level\": Python, JavaScript, Swift, etc.\n\nYou can, of course, have a good programming future with a high-level programming language only, never even touching C/C++, but you will never be able to write low-level software such as a game.",

Here the Odin Project also does a great job. You learn the theory and then you build a project they provide where for each project you need all the theory you were supposed to learn prior. The course is hard and takes a long time to finish but imo is far better than a 5 hour youtube tutorial. Just watching someone code or just copying a project is not the same as creating your own version of a project which you will be required to do in the Odin Project. It reads like an ad but I did use it to learn Web Development and I just legit think it's a fantastic course if you are ready to put the time and effort in.",

Make things work. Break things, then fix them so they work. You can spend 10 years learning the theory but until you actually code something it just won't really click. Like trying to learn to be a mechanic by watching YouTube but never actually touching a car. Sure, you could figure things about and fix them, in theory, but if your car actually broke down well, don't strip your nuts over tightening~ \n\nPick a project/s and just code them out. Start with the simplest thing you can code, and start making it do more and more.",

Someone in their basement can write a kernel and all the hundreds of things to control an entire computer, if they are reasonably smart and dedicated.

You can make it much simpler by only plugging together libraries and learning about how the parts work. Or even just use a browser engine like Chromium und wrap features around that as hundreds of vendors have done.\n\nSo, let’s just say: it’s not a great project for an early student. It will be messy and unpleasant. There are probably nicer side projects like games, a browser extension, coming up with one specific tool or library and bring that to completion and share it. It’s way more satisfying to build something tiny but useful, even if it exists already, than trying to fumble around in a large ambitious project, learn a few things but ultimately lose interest without a result.\n\nIf you want to stick with web tech, pick one aspect: just video rendering or just CSS parsing and build a lib for that as an exercise, but you can still publish it as an achievement for your portfolio.",

This thought is also why I ended up in a warehouse instead of being a software engineer with a great career. \nThrough coincidence I saw a comment on Reddit where someone asked what's best way to learn web development? Someone said try the Odin Project. I went on the website and really liked what I saw and decided I will start to learn how to code but this time I promised myself that if I start I won't stop no matter what. This promise to myself would become very important later as I had several moments where I wanted to give up in the beginning because I couldn't solve some Javascript puzzle.\nAt the same time I had the idea for an App that we could really use in the company I work at. For many years we used a whiteboard to do shift planing and it was really cumbersome so my goal is to develop an App for this but I had no idea how.\n7 months passed by and I was around half done with the Odin Project and decided I had enough know how to start developing the digital shift planer. If anyone is interested in the detailed development process of the App I wrote a long post in the Odin Project subreddit, you can check it out in my profile.\nAnyway after 3 months I had a working app that we now use for almost a year and as mentioned above I also won a company price for it. And after our IT guy posted it on the companies social media (it's a huge company with around 30.000 employees worldwide) I had several requests from managers around the world from countries like Taiwan, India and a couple of others for a demo. It turned out that they all are still using Whiteboards for their shift management. \nWhile this is happening I am developing an App that me and a buddy of mine plan to turn into a small company.\nAll in all I spent around 3000 hours now with programming over almost 2 years. It's never too late of course to start but I can't help but think if I had put that effort in when I was 15 I'm sure I wouldn't have ended up in a warehouse. The only thing I know is that I won't stop anymore and maybe it will lead to somewhere, maybe it won't but even if not then it will stay a lifelong hobby for me that I do in my freetime like I do now.",

Later switch to TypeScript and learn the Angular UI framework, and you will have a highly marketable skill.\n\nAnother worthwhile first language that is production ready is C#. You can use a Game Engines like Godot or Unity to learn it. Using a game engine will give you plenty of engaging ways, to visualize what you do and will keep you motivated to follow through, as you will be able to create very nice programming challenges in a game world setting.\n\nAnother highly regarded option for a first language to learn is Python.\n\nAs always, feel free to check some job sites to see how many job openings exist for a certain language or skill if you need advice about what to learn.",

But quality varies a lot and there’s little guidance or expert feedback. Also, these courses are created individual around the world....very few brands put up their courses there.\n\n\nSimplilearn – Feels like a good balance between flexibility and structure. You get self-paced content, live expert sessions, and real-world projects, so you’re actually applying what you learn. They also have partnerships with Microsoft, IBM, and AWS, which keeps everything relevant one things which could be better is if some modules can be a bit faster, but overall, its great way to build practical skills. Also, certification from these big giants really matter when you apply for any job.\n\n\nand yeah, coursra is good too but more theoretical than hands-on. Great for building strong foundations, not necessarily for immediate job-ready skills. They have some subscriptions plans too that you can explore..\n\n\nWhich ones have you explored so far?",

        "body": "First of all, you have your boiler plate stuff.  Creating the solution and the main project, setting up configuration. \n\nI have separate projects for different parts.\n\n* Main program - UI / API (+web)  \n* Business layer - called by the UI, contains operational logic\n* Data layer - called by the Business layer, houses Entity Framework code or anything that accesses the database.\n* Models - usually a sub-folder in the business layer, this is where the DTOs go\n* Services - also usually in the business layer, this is where classes that do stuff not directly related to the business logic (fetching/processing external data like HTTP or file calls, CSV, etc)\n* Database scripts - I'm a database-first guy, I like to write SQL, and use EFgen to (re)generate the context and models whenever the DB changes. I use DBUp to sync changes across environments. This is obviously optional.\n \nThen I think about the data it's going to be working with. I usually start with the database first, creating tables and indices, thinking about what kind of data I need to store. I might miss a couple of things that can go in later.\n\nI then think about how I want to access the data from the outside. I create a business layer class for each \"domain\". A domain is usually one table, but it may access other tables as needed. I don't do repositories as they are mostly just extra work, also EF is a repository, but you do you.\n\nThe business layers job is to restrict how data can be accessed. What goes in when you create a new object? Usually the pattern is\n\n* Search - a way to list and possibly page through a set of objects, returning a summarized, smaller object that contains only the stuff that needs to be displayed. If paging is required, I have a generic class that returns the paged set and the total count. I also have a common extendable filter class.\n* Get - returns more detail about the object. May return child objects as needed.\n* Create / Update / Delete \n\nThere may be more, specific ways to interact with the domain, those get added as needed. Sometimes you want to update only one field, like status, progress, without updating the entire object. Separating thouse out give a nice, clean, clear API and shows intent.\n\nIf this is a web project, the controllers are mostly interfaces to the business layer. I can sometimes call multiple business layers in one place, but I never try to reuse code from one business layer as-is unless it makes complete sense. Don't be afraid to repeat some code. Or if you do, push it to a service that gets shared. The main goal is that each method should be doing something unique, and that if it changes, then everything affected should be minimally affected, i.e. the change shouldn't affect their core behavior.\n\nI separate (as much as possible) security from the business layer. So business logic should only care about what to do, not who is accessing it. Sure you will pass in some user information for filtering, and you will have logic that changes based on who is accessing the data, but you should have up-front checks before the business layer is called. This way you can test or use your business logic, either via unit tests or in a prototyping project without having to deal with setting up security contexts.",

Not learning programming.\n\nYou'd be better off getting a course from a place like Codecademy, Coursera, Udemy, SkillShare or other such paid service.  You could go get some programming books as well.  One problem though is what do you want to program.  Are you going to want to learn to be a\n\n* front-end developer\n* back-end developer\n* mobile developer\n* data science\n* User Testing\n* Desktop developer\n* Cloud developer\n* API developer\n* Embedded systems developer\n* legacy developer\n\nIf you don't know where you want to aim at, it's hard to tell you what to learn.  However, some places to start are basic programming language topics like variables, control structures, and data structures.  Each of these will exist within pretty much every programming language.  You should learn multiple languages.  You should learn problem-solving skills.  You should learn debugging skills, version control, and be familiar with at least one developer tool(IDE).  You should also have communication skills because gone are the days of the nerd locked away in the steam tunnel.   You have to be able to communicate and explain technical concepts to both technical and nontechnical audiences.  You should learn how to document both your code and possibly write technical documentation.  You should understand how to collaborate with other developers so that you can integrate code.   Also know that everything you learn now will likely become slowly obsolete.  So, expect a lifetime of constantly learning new tools, languages, and technologies.\n\nGood luck",

Depending on how exactly you define this problem, those are between 1000!/900! to 1000\\^100 sequences, which is about 2\\^1000. There must be one number (seed) for every possible sequence. So that seed would have to be up to 1000 bits long, so around 125 bytes (octets). This is about 10x longer than the \"10-15 characters\" that you were hoping for, more if you were hoping for ASCII characters.\n\n\nIn general: there is no free lunch for compression. All compression techniques rely on the data having some pattern that can be described more compactly than just using the raw data.\n\n\nFurther reading:\n\n\n* Shannon entropy is a concept for describing how much information is in a piece of data. This measures how \"surprising\" the data is. Compressed data cannot be shorter than the Shannon entropy in bits. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory\n* Kolmogorov complexity describes the theoretically most compact representation of data, i.e. how long a program would be that reproduces the data. In your model, the seeds would correspond to programs that generatea sequence. The seeds cannot be shorter than the sequence's Kolmogorov complexity. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity\n* The Pigeonhole Principle is a useful technique for thinking through these kinds of problems. Here, I used this principle to notice that the size of the seed (pigeon holes) must be at least as large as the number of distinct sequences (pigeons) I want to generate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle",

        "body": "> This would allow transferring 100 numbers (or maybe many more?) just by sending a single seed\n\nEach input needs to map to a distinct possible seed value.\n\nIf you want to send say 5 numbers between 0-999 your \"seed\" has to range from 0-999,999,999,999,999.  To \"go backwards\" you just mark off each 3-digit group.\n\n- You can store a number from 0-999 in 10 bits.\n- You can store a number from 0-999,999,999,999,999 in 50 bits.\n\nYou can combine several smaller numbers into a bigger number.  This can capture a few fractional bits of savings [1] but you can't magically convert an arbitrary 100-number sequence to a single 32-bit int.\n\nTo actually compress data (losslessly), your compressed form needs to be variable-length.  Then you assign more likely inputs to shorter compressed forms.  (This only works if some inputs are less likely than others.  If all possible inputs are equally likely, the average compressed output will be at least as long as the input, regardless of the internal workings of the compression function.)\n\n[1] Information-theoretically, a number from 0-999 contains log(1000) / log(2) = 9.966 bits of information, assuming each number 0-999 is equally likely.  You need 10 bits to store such a number because a block of actual memory is always a whole number of bits.\n\nFor example, if the maximum number is slightly larger than a power of 2, say your numbers range from 0..1099, then each one is log(1100) / log(2) = 10.103 bits.  You need 11 bits each to store your numbers separately, wasting 0.897 bits.  You could store 5 numbers in a single value ranging from 0..1100^5 - 1 which would only need 51 bits.  The \"theoretical\" savings is 0.897 x 5 = 4.485 bits; in practice we only get 4 bits.  Again, we \"waste\" 0.485 bits because a block of actual memory is always a whole number of bits.",

The OS still doesn’t do it. With some runtimes, like .net, you do have to specify a target cpu architecture as well. That’s a VM design choice on whether they want to abstract certain cpu features like the size of registers (32 vs 64 bit), endian storage, etc. and OS features. These choices still have to be made eventually of course and abstraction adds overhead if the actual cpu uses a different standard.

But I feel, that when we use AI while learning things, our learnings become incomplete.\n\nThough AI becomes inevitable sometimes for finding errors that come after a continuous 2hrs of non stop coding, or understanding lengthy logs that tell about some error we have never made, or a dependency from those 20files we forgot to inject. \n\nBut I always use AI for brainstorming sessions in solo projects(since I need an opinion on my work too) asking if my idea was right, to rate my idea, talk about the limitations of my ideas.\n\nUsing AI for discussing on optimizations is the best part of using AI(But the prompt must make it clear to only discuss but not to code) . \n\nNot that I completely don't use AI to code. I use it for filling up those blocks of code which involve the topics I haven't covered yet but have to submit the work within very less time.\n\nThis is my way of using AI in my project works.",

The second part is sometimes not something that you can see.\n\nGuys I work with heavily rely on AI. Here is what I have noticed since I have to review their code. They understand the code it generates. But they don't understand or aren't aware of the problems the AI is trying to solve. So when it implements a solution,  it looks correct, it technically does what it said it does, but it's often not actually correct...even when it looks like the code is working. \n\n- AI will happily reinvent the wheel. Not only that,  it will reinvent a slightly incorrect wheel and each wheel will be slightly different, even though it's supposed to be the same wheel. \n\n- The best way to have no bugs in your application is to delete all your code. AI will happily delete your code. We did a review where a guy was having problems with authentication. He just kept feeding the errors into AI. What did AI do? It deleted the entire Authentication system in the front-end and hardcodwd an API key in it's place. Problem solved 😂😂😂. \n\n- I am constantly finding race conditions in the code these guys submit. Why? Because they aren't aware of the implications of the code they are submitting.\n\nNow I work with another guy who does know what he's doing. He has AI write a lot of the code. But he is constantly correcting AI. Telling it that what it produced is garbage. He can make AI iterate to a correct solution a lot of the time. Other times, it's just quicker to write it yourself because the AI just doesn't get.\n\nWhen I was learning, I recognized that I didn't know what I didn't know. Knowing thst this class problems even exists in the first place is 99% of the battle. What separates experienced developers from junior developers is knowledge of what types of problems exist. \n\n\n\nNow as far as learning, I relied a lot on YouTube tutorials, books, Google, stackoverflow etc to learn concepts and how to make something.  In my case, there was a project that flipped the switch for me. I went from not knowing how to do anything other than stupid little college programs to \"holy shit...it makes sense now\". That was a project that I actually made for a group and they actually used it. And in using it, they ran into all kinds of problems. Encountering those problems and thinking about why they are occurring and then solving them...that's what really started my learning. Most of my solutions came to me during long showers 😂😂😂.  Once you start to understand those problems, you start to realize that there's even problems. And that opens up a whole new world. You can get out of Tutorial hell and know what actually research.",

You will probably end up using a library to convert pixels into a PNG file.  If you struggle, you can always come back here with a more specific question (\"I'm writing a drawing program as a webpage in JavaScript.  The user puts pixels on a canvas with the mouse.  How do I convert those pixels on the canvas to a PNG file for the user to download?\").\n\nIt's up to you how far you go into the details of graphics drawing.  For example, whether you use the line-drawing function provided by your graphics library, or you [convert a line to pixels yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm).\n\nC++ can be helpful if you want high-resolution, high-performance drawing code for fancy effects, or you want to interface with existing C++ libraries.

You start by copying mostof it ir modifying what's already there. With time you become more proficient and build up a mental repertoire of patterns that are frequently used. With time you will come to the point at which you will be given a task and immediately think of patterns you've used previously. when given a task you break it down into smaller problems like copying files, sending data over a serial connection, receiving, logging to a file or plotting data. You don't have to reinvent the wheel. most of these singular tasks are solved in a similar way most of the time and you only have to tweak or modify according to the current circumstances of the project. So just start small, continue reading a lot of code by others but most importantly stick with writing a lot of code yourself. This is what cements that mental repertoire.",

That way you get the full picture.\n\nIf you want to focus on one part of the stack, pick one and go.\n\nThe trouble I have seen with that is you are only getting part of the picture. For example, a backend engineer will work with the server and the database too. However, at the beginning they really do not know what the requirements are to interact with another engineer that is working on the frontend.\n\nSame for the frontend, they don't really know what to send to the server, how to send it, and what to do with it when they get it if then don't have someone on the backend to interact with.\n\nYou are learning on your own so you will be missing one of the sides if you don't do both.\n\nJust some thoughts about it.

Even if they had the concepts of \"line\" or \"curve\" and the math built in, they would still need to interpolate through several algorithms to produce the output on their natural display grid.\n\nIf you were to hand draw your line, your hands intrinsically and sub consciously do very complex calculations similar to what computers do, plus, contrary to computers, you have your visual feedback loop. Try drawing a curved line in pitch dark as this is basically what a computer can see - nothing. Have you ever tried to draw a curved line on an \"Etch-A-Sketch\"? Similar problem. Or, get a CAD program to precisely draw your curved line. Or, get a 3D printer or a CNC machine to follow your curved path. All these are far from simple.\n\nCurves in general are no trivial math, no matter what algorithms or what curve systems you use. Every trigonometry or math professor will tell you that.\n\nWhat we humans classify as \"simple\" doesn't mean it is really \"simple\" in an objective manner.\n\nComputers are generally very dumb devices that are only good in one thing: calculating\n\nYou have to tell them every single minuscule step that they have to perform.\n\nOnce you accept that computers are extremely dumb and that you have to tell them every minuscule step you are on the right track to becoming a programmer. \n\nStop assuming things, stop classifying things.

First just get it to work. If it’s too slow, do some optimisation on the bottlenecks. Then look, is this readable?

Setting out to build a huge system, which is what you have envisioned, is likely to result in feeling like its too big and burnout. I would encourage you to pick one small component of what you want to build and do that. Skip the fancy UI, make it a command line utility so you don't get bogged down with building a fancy interface. Stay very focussed on it and only it. Don't worry if it feels like you can't visualize it, you can add that later once the core is working. For example, \"signal processing\" is very general. What inputs do you want to process to produce what outputs? Pick one, say the ability to accept stereo audio and determine which side of the space it is on. Not where it is, just which side, ie left or right. Test it, first with unit tests, then using live data. Get it working, very well. Feeding unreliable data to the next step in the processing pipeline will create pain as you have to determine which component is unreliable. Then add multiple sources of input, ie two people having a conversation back and forth. Extend it to identify that there isn't a single source. Get that working. Then extend again to identify which side the sources are on. Get it working. Unit test everything so you don't accidentally break stuff that you had working. I could go on and on and on...but that is how you build a complex system from the ground up.\n\nExpect your project to take years working on it full time. What you have laid out is a \\*massive\\* undertaking. Spend ample time evaluating existing libraries and tools that do the things you want...it's almost always easier and faster to use existing components than to build your own. Beware of the licenses...don't use anything that you don't want to be restricted by in the future. You can always replace components with others or your own if you determine they don't work. That might be reasonable to get you past a hurdle, but can also be a waste of time if you try to use something and it just isn't suited. Rack it up as a learning experience and move on.\n\nBreak everything down into manageable chunks. Days or maybe a week...longer than that does not provide enough structure or confidence in feasibility. Don't know how to do something in order to know how long it will take? Break it down into chunks that you can research until you know enough to have a good idea of what is involved and how long it will take.\n\nDid I mention breaking things down into manageable chunks? This project planning can be difficult because it's more fun to dive in. It is a necessity...don't skip it. It will be more gratifying to get a small task done rather than have a big undefined task that slogs on and on.",

You'll come to regret it.\n\nFirst of all - you'll spend all your time finding the perfect translation, but often the words themselves don't actually mean in programming, what they mean in English. Just something as basic as \"print\" - it never means \"print\", it always means \"write this sequence of characters to the standard output stream, be it a file, or terminal-window\". Which is probably why different languages (and APIs) calls it write, print, log, out, or >> ... So what should your translation be? And if you choose the Spanish word for \"write\" as the function name for \"print\", then what'll you do when you suddenly come across another function called \"write\"? Should that be called the same, or something different?\n\nAnd even if you succesfully translate all the functions, classes and methods, you still can't translate words like if, while, for, function, class, return and so on - you you'll still end up with a mix.\n\nAnd the worst part is - when you forget what a translation means, and come across some of your earlier code - you'll have no way of understanding what it actually does, if the Spanish-named functions are part of the program itself, or translations of the system-functions. And you won't be able to search for anything, because no one else knows your exact translation files ...\n\nBut you are not the first thinking these thoughts, and in fact there has been a number of localized programming languages around the world. There even is a Spanish version of C, called Sí: [https://akercheval.github.io/si/](https://akercheval.github.io/si/)\n\nAnd a bunch more: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-English-based\\_programming\\_languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-English-based_programming_languages)",

Suggestions:\n\n\\- Run your app on your physical device, not an emulator.\n\n\\- Look into compiling your android app from the command line if you find Android Studio IDE is too much, but it should be fine to be honest, and you could do with it for the layout preview if nothing else.\n\nNothing to do with brew.\n\nIt's not that it's old, 2020 is nothing. It's that it's cheap (for a Mac). The Airs are the reduced spec offerings. Plus Android dev is one type of dev where having an IDE does really help as it's annoying to build out UI without it (IMO).",

        "body": "> How to figure things out on my own?\n\nKind of ironic that you're even asking this, rather than figuring it out on your own, no?\n\nThe process is pretty straight forward - you think about it. You read about it. YOU BEGIN BY STUMBLING AROUND, LOST AND ALONE IN THE DARK until you trip over something that might possibly happen to lead you somewhere. You have no idea what you're doing or where you're going until you get there, only to discover it was a dead end, and then you have to backpedal and try to figure out where else you might be able to go - perhaps from a past breadcrumb, perhaps a different trailhead you found along the way that you can come back to.\n\nFiguring shit out on your own means being lost most of the time. If you are willing to accept that whatever you're trying to do - you're likely not the first, and your problem was probably already solved first 60-80 years ago, then there's a lot of academic research to do. It's reading, reading, reading...\n\nIf what you're doing IS unique, well then you have to spend a lot of time just thinking, just trying stuff. Every failure informs you of what not to do and how not to do it. You have to know what you want to accomplish in the first place so you can measure how far off you are.\n\n> I want to know how I can truly figure things out on my own and study effectively without missing important or essential information\n\nYou need to embrace that you're totally missing shit, all the time. There is a depth of knowledge in front of you that you have no idea is even there, but the more you learn of it, the more profound all future insights would be, the faster and better you will find future solutions.\n\nBut don't miss the forest for the trees. I've been programming for over 30 years - I'm tickled that Unicode is backward compatible with 1830s telegraph equipment, and that means something to me, but it doesn't mean anything to you. You're not there and it doesn't have to matter.\n\n> while also avoiding wasting too much time\n\nThis bad attitude is not going to serve you. NOTHING is a waste of your time. Thomas Edison didn't invent the lightbulb, but he did improve upon it. He said it himself - he didn't fail 10,000 times, he just found 10,000 ways how not to do it. That information was GOLD back then. You don't learn from successes but failures. Being lost and stumbling, \"wasting time\" as you put it is a very necessary part of the process, it builds your intuition, which is what you actually need - knowledge you don't know you have and don't have to think about, but it informs you. You may not yet be on the path you want, but you're learning all sorts of other things, and it always comes back around to aid you.",

You can organize into projects, epics, stories, tasks, subtasks, with priorities and current status, assignments, and related issues (blockers, etc.). There are comments, descriptions, attachments, and workflows, backlogs, and sprints (or kanban). It is pretty easy to create simple tasks and you can go as deep into it as you want. This would be great process learning as this is the way companies typically work.\n\nI hope this helps. Ask more questions if you have them. You all are doing a really great job learning.",

Like do you really need a timeline and assignments, etc, when you can just talk face to face in class.\n\nAnd my suggestion, as an alternate, or cooperative, because it's what I'm learning, is to try out Test Driven Development (TDD).  Or BDD or whatever who calls it.\n\nTDD is kinda tricky until you get used to it, but fundamentally, it's just your list of notion tasks, written as code, as part of your codebase.  You just have to change your point of view from \"is this task complete?\" to \"is this task fail-pass?\"  It's an automated checklist.  It's an awesome feeling to run my tests and have a lot of ✅✅✅✅✅ show up.\n\n\nI'm not saying to follow TDD strictly to the letter.  I'm saying to add a bit of testing.  Even now, when you write your code, you need to know if it's working or not.  Automate your manual checks is what I'm saying.",

        "body": "Jira is absolutely a solid choice (when it isn't atrociously slow, but that's not something you need to worry about). I won't try to convince you of something else. Below is more of a personal observation to put my recommendation in context.\n\nI have worked with a lot of bugtracking/planning software. bugzilla, trac, redmine, jira, codebeamer, github issues, IBM doors... big and small, well-known to self-made. At the end they all do more or less the same with varying degrees of usability and features.\n\nAnd some things never change:\n\n- Planning is mostly garbage. This isn't a slight against you, this is universal. The entire agile movement at its heart is about the realisation that planning longer than two weeks ahead is reading tea leaves. If you need to plan, plan only enough to keep people busy for a week. Ideally the subjects of what needs to be done should fit on a single screen. Jira can do that, a text file can do that too.\n- Any planning tool is only as good as the people maintaining it. It's a non-trivial commitment and it is thankless work, and people who like coding will quickly forget about it. Only commit to processes you can also keep up. Jira can model entire epics and release plans and whatnot - and will gladly rot away with outdated information unless you slavishly document everything there.\n- Text is king. Whatever you do, a few month from now you'll need to find it again within the hundreds of tasks you did in the meantime. You can search for text, but you can not search for audio or images. Try to keep everything as text as long as possible. The tracker may have fancy images or support draw.io embeddings, but as soon as you try to export to pdf or copy paste into a code editor or try to localise it breaks in creative ways.\n- Locality is also king. Every external tool is a chance for things to go out of sync or to get lost. There's an old open source project where I have been contributing for over two decades now. We've gone through 5 different bugtrackers in that time. Every time the decision to move was correct in the circumstances, but every time it meant we lost the entire bug history.",

If you have 30,000 sensors around the country with button cells in, you want it to be 5-10 years before you have to replace those... so we use microcontrollers and C (sometimes C++). Custom protocols are sometimes seen, but LoRa(WAN) etc. are common too. You need to be comfortable at the bits-and-bytes level ideally. Good fundamentals in general software dev (data structures etc.), network programming, are necessary. The ability to understand a bit about hardware is a nice to have.\n\nYou can also get into the networking and infrastructure side, or the distributed system design side of things, and of course you have standard app development to actually use the data from things like sensors and devices on the network etc.\n\nCool field if you like to stick your fingers in many pies.\n\nEdit: Forgot databases. Ideally you would be comfortable with different types e.g. relational, hierarchical/document, columnar etc. SQL is great to have. All this device data is stored places.\n\nAlso, knowledge of logs, queues, pub sub on the distributed/processing side of things. Services need to communicate etc.\n\nEdit 2: I should add that we wouldn't expect a junior/grad to come with all this, I'm just listing things you should be thinking about.

        "body": "The economics of hiring a sole freelancer to build a bespoke, enterprise-grade, production-ready web app from scratch just do not make sense.\n\nThe market case for freelancers is almost exclusive to small to medium businesses, who typically only need simple sites like a one-page brochures/menus, or at most a simple e-commerce site. And these are all scenarios where a solution like site builders, CMS etc are not only easier, but often the most appropriate solution. Any experienced dev will tell you there's no point reinventing the wheel unnecessarily, and you really want to avoid building yourself from scratch anything that handles money or PII.\n\nCompanies that do need custom web app development/maintenance, are hiring teams of them on long-term contracts or FTEs, via job postings/recruiters/consultancies, not from bloody Fiverr or the local community notice board. And that's almost exclusively larger businesses. Or smaller businesses run by inexperienced entrepreneurs whose eyes are bigger than their budgets, whom you should avoid.\n\nSo yes they're hiring true full stack devs, they're as in-demand as ever, but not in the places you're looking. And between the economy & mass industry layoffs, cheap foreign labor, and the several-years-long influx of newbies who've been convinced a 6 week \"bootcamp\" is enough to get rich quick and that freelancing is the cheat code to success when real companies won't hire you; competition is pretty fierce so your work is cut out for you.\n\nIf you truly want to attempt this you would avoid those freelancing platforms, that ecosystem is tailored towards small COTS solutions with short turnaround. Instead work on running your own business and getting industry connections, attracting clients etc for the kind of work you want to do. Basically run your own consultancy. Be prepared to subcontract, spend more time running a business than actually coding, and don't bite off more than you can chew. Best of luck though, I don't like your chances.",

Being software developer is more than Odin Projects and such. Better go for a degree. And how will it take 6 years for you? I can understand 3-4 years as this seems to be the norm. Or will you combine it with Master studies? In most places you won't need a Master degree for a junior developer position. Or, did you mean this 250 euros per month online university? Perhaps their study load is much lower and this is why it takes also more years for you to get a degree.\n\nWhat I did was dropping my work load to 50% and going to an actual university where I had to show up in person, sit in lectures, etc. Yeah, I had close to no free time for anything but study, work, eat, sleep, but I managed to get it done. With university your portfolio will be also better, you'll have connections from your course mates, from your professors, from your club mates (computer club and such). Your theoretical knowledge will be also stronger.\n\nAnd do not listen to the people who are fear mongering how the AI will take our jobs. It will not take any job. Learn to use it as a tool.",

I chose online university (iu distance learning) because it takes longer and I can go through the material more slowly, as I have to study alongside my 40-hour job. If I chose full-time university, it would take less time but it would be stressful. I've already tried to study in Austria, but I don't have a high school diploma, so I have to take additional courses to get in. I have to do that at IU too, but it's not as strict (e.g., how to write a bachelor's thesis and basic math, English, and German). There is a university in Vienna that is very strict, and many say that it is so difficult at the beginning that they can't get through it with a 20-hour work week. That's why online IU is probably the best choice for me. I also thought that I would study computer science in general (networking, software development, web development...) and do a master's in cyber security.\n\nThanks for sharing your story. Self-study is good, but to avoid tutorial hell, you have to choose something specific. \n\nIch habe kein Angst von AI weil ich habe teilweise benutzt.

As a teen interested in digital electronics, I actually enjoyed making something as simple as an electronic counter - and convinced myself that I could use it to count how many push-ups I did :) \n\nIf you are more into \"understanding\" than soldering, you can also build emulators and simulators, experiment with creating your own assembler or disassembler for a simple CPU, or play with languages and compilers, and create your own. It doesn't have to be useful to anyone else - as long as you enjoy building. You'll learn much, much more by building (or programming) something, than only reading about it!",

LeetCode isolates common problems so that you'll have seen them when you encounter them in the wild, but a lot of their questions are extremely artificial to force a certain solution. Real problems don't care about a certain solution. If you have to migrate data between different schemas a compact sql query with  some window function magic will work - a stored procedure with cursors will work also.\n\nBeyond those algorithmic primitives, LeetCode is just some gamified sport, but not the real thing.

But that's not really the way you would want to approach a \"real\" project.\n\n(Also, your post history looks *very* AI-generated to me, but I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming this is a real question.)\n\nMore specifically:\n\n> Session design: is a short-lived rotating session_id ok for beginners?  Or should I avoid any session at all and just do per-request stateless tagging. I don’t want to overcollect but also need dedupe. What’s a simple pattern you’ve learned that isn’t fragile?\n\nThe point of using sessions at all for analytics is to be able to correlate which *different* requests are from the same user. It only makes sense if that corresponds to a metric that you want to calculate.\n\nWith no session at all, you can count requests, but you don't know which requests came from the same user. With short-lived sessions, you can count distinct *visits* (and analyze what happened within each visit) but you don't know anything about the number of *visitors*. With long-lived sessions, you know which visits are from the same visitor. It all depends on what kind of analysis you want to support.\n\nI don't understand what you mean by \"fragile\" or how that has anything to do with what you're asking.\n\n> Table design: would you partition events by month or just single table + indexes first? I worry I’m prematurely optimizing, but also events can grow alot.\n\nDon't partition a table unless you have a specific performance problem that partitioning is the only way to solve. This is unlikely to happen until you have billions of rows or terabytes of data. And that is extremely unlikely to ever happen for a personal portfolio site.\n\nIf you really do expect a huge volume of data like that, and you need to know ahead of time whether partitioning is worth it, then the best way to answer that question is to do actual testing with large amounts of synthetic data.\n\n> Rollups: is a daily materialized view better than cron-based INSERT INTO rollup tables?\n\nA materialized view generated from a query, and a table that you manually refresh by performing a query, are essentially the same thing. It's basically just a syntax difference. They have the same advantages and disadvantages.\n\n> Exports: do beginners really need XML too or is CSV/JSON enough? Any strong reasons to add NDJSON or Parquet later, or is that just yak shaving for now.\n\nWhat do you need to export data for?\n\nI'm not saying you *don't*, but if you do want to build some kind of export functionality, it should be driven by an actual requirement, not just picking arbitrary formats.\n\n> Webhooks versioning: how do you version webhook payloads cleanly so you don’t break consumers? Prefix with v1 in the topic, or version in the JSON body?\n\nSame here. Why do you need webhooks at all? Why do you need to version them? Who else but you is going to be using them?\n\n> Testing: for this kind of logging pipeline, is it better to unit-test the rollup SQL heavily, or focus on property tests around the event validator? I feel my tests are too shallow, honestly.\n\nI don't understand why you're framing this as an \"either-or\". You should test every component whose correctness you care about.",

But never limit yourself to just follow a course - have ideas for your own personal projects, and pick and choose subjects and courses that'll help you build those!

You don't need to learn every single thing from all of those areas, or even from a single book. Just being familiar with the core ideas / basics helps a lot. Then slowly study more of those books and topics as time goes by.\n\nBut here are some of the best programming books that were popular already back in the 1990s:\n\n* The Art Of Computer Programming series of books (Donald Knuth)\n* Design Patterns (Gamma, Helm, etc.)\n* Anti Patterns (Brown, Malveau)\n* Refactoring (Martin Fowler)\n* Pragmatic Programmer (Hunt, Thomas)\n* Introduction To Algorithms (Cormen, Leiserson)\n\nThose should get you really far. And the more you test everything you've read and learned from the books, the faster you'll become good at what you do. So don't wait to try out the ideas from those books. Try them out when you're reading, if possible. Pick a project or two and develop them from start to finish. You'll learn tons that way. Only reading doesn't get you very far.

Then you keep learning and never stop.\n\nhttps://guides.rubyonrails.org/\n\nAfter playing with rails a little maybe get the basics of Ruby?\n\nhttps://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/\n\nThen maybe try to climb a mountain? The Odin project isn’t perfect (I’ve heard from people it may have some gaps or not explain everything as clearly or in as much detail as they would like). But if you supplement it with some google / chat gpt / reading docs / watching videos you can go a long way. It’s also free.\n\nhttps://www.theodinproject.com/\n\nDeployment / hosting / domain\n\nFor a few bucks a month you can toss a rails app with SQLite up on fly.io. You’ll get a subdomain they give you and also can add your own custom domain. I love them.\nWhy SQLite? SQLite doesn’t require a database server. You basically read/write to a local file and that’s the database. For small to mid size apps it’s great. If you are lucky enough to need more rails will make it (relatively) easy to drop in MySQL or postgres. And by the time that happens you should have the knowledge or money to make it happen. LiteFs makes it so you can have one server be primary with reads and writes and then have your SQLite db replicated around the world to different servers acting as read replicas. Fly.io makes it so that all post/put/patch/delete requests go to the primary and get requests go to the geographically closest server. For things like verify a users account from an email - a get requests that ends up writing to the db you will need to have an intermediate page which auto submits a form and/or allows a user to click a button to do so. That way you just execute read from the email link and then a post request for a write. By the time you get to deployment all this will make more sense.\n\nhttps://fly.io/docs/rails/\n\nhttps://fly.io/docs/litefs/",

You would then need to inform the players with the IP and port to connect to.\n\nSlightly harder. Use a tool like ngrok to create the network forwarding connection, just means that you need to run both the server and the ngrok client on the same machine really. You would then need to inform the players of the ngrok endpoint to connect to.\n\nNext level up, run the server on some cloud hosting providers like AWS, GCP, IBM, Heroku, or the many others. The easiest would be a containerized deployment. A Binary install would also be possible. Many providers have a trial or free compute tier you could use for a period of time. You could then have the clients connect to that and be able to discover the server and the game.\n\nThere are plenty more options available all at increasing technical understanding requirements and cost.",

Don't do encryption at first; just get it working.\n\n- Can you open a server and talk to it from a client on the same computer?\n- Can you talk to the server from multiple clients on the same computer?\n- Can you open a server and talk to it from another client on the same LAN?  (Maybe ask a friend / family member to loan you their laptop for testing if you only own one PC, or get a cheap old PC / Raspberry Pi / whatever for a second system)\n\nThe next big jump is talking to a client in another location.  I recommend trying the \"traditional\" process first:\n\n- Set the host machine to have a fixed LAN IP address\n- Set your router to forward connections to that port from the Internet to that machine\n- Figure out your public IP address (e.g. whatismyip.com )\n- Connect from outside (e.g. rent a VPS for testing, or take your laptop to a coffee shop)\n\nThe point of this exercise is that you, personally, understand how to open a port on your PC.\n\nNow you have to make a choice:\n\n- If your target users are fairly technical, you can just tell them \"You have to open port 5123 (or change it in the config file if you want a different port)\".  That's perfectly fine; technically knowledgeable people expect any server software to listen on a port, and understand how to expose ports to the world.\n- If you want to target non-technical users, you have to look into firewall hole-punching using technologies like UPnP or STUN.  I'm not super familiar with the details; you'll have to do some research.\n\nHonestly, if you're targeting non-technical users, it's probably easier to simply rent a VPS and have users connect to it.\n\nIf you rent a VPS and register a domain name, you can set up a standard HTTPS cert with Let's Encrypt, then use an nginx reverse proxy to do the actual encryption.  There are plenty of tutorials of how to do this on the Internet, and LLM's understand how it works, so you can ask them questions about the details.\n\nIf you don't have a domain, or for self-hosted servers, [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77510803/how-to-make-a-simple-https-server-in-p) is how to get started doing HTTPS in Python (as opposed to using nginx).  Note, you have to generate a key / cert on the server, and then you have to somehow get the server's certificate to the client.",

And a two year gap is an issue, but it’s something you can overcome (you can also finesse it on delivery).\n\n1. Go all out on applying right now to see if you can get an offer within the calendar year. It’s unlikely, given how close we are to the end, but those kinds of arbitrary markers matter on a resume.\n2. Target what’s sinking you. It sounds like you have to some extent, but in a more nebulous way. Do practice interviews with other people online. There’s literally nothing more important than that, and getting feedback.\n\nAlso, I second what everyone else said about vitamin deficiencies, chemical imbalances, etc. Sometimes it's just something medical in our bodies that needs tending to.",

Had to move back in with my parents, it all made me miserable. \n\nFinally decided if I wanted to do something worthwhile, I would need a degree. Turns out if you haven't been in school for awhile, its hard to get accepted to a technical program, so did community college for a year, got into a program, didn't really know what I wanted to do, did math, decided CS might be reasonable. Transferred to a different (better engineering school), COVID hit, decided the work I was doing in CS was remarkably boring, did really poorly, felt wayward again. Got transfered to a different program (Civil Engineering), got through the whole program pretty quickly and cleanly, basically could care less about it. Now I am in a Computing  applied AI and systems masters program trying to focus on the components I actually enjoy (to varying degrees of success so far). The joy I find in all of this comes in at the edges, and honestly my girlfriend and cooking, the little things I do everyday keep me sane.\n\nI say all of this to say its okay to be struggling, its fine to vent and shout into the void, its fine to be tired and disappointed and honestly, in my experience is its also normal to feel like you are doing everything right and still come up feeling like you didn't get anywhere. Life is a grind, survival is a grind and if you can set goals and work towards them, that is awesome (and aspirational), but when something doesn't work out, for whatever reason, it doesn't mean you are washed, you aren't done, just time to figure out the next thing.",

Might get a handful of people trying to weasel through on a VPN, but it would at least create a barrier, and I’m sure the HR folks that review the resumes and stuff would appreciate not having to sift through 90 resumes of ineligible applicants just to find the handful of eligible ones interspersed throughout.",

        "body": "Yep, this is one thing I think a looooooot of execs either underestimate or don't even think about when they decide on a layoff.\n\nWhen I was laid off in early 2023, half the engineering department was let go, so from 16 people down to 8. Had a final meeting with my boss the day before my last day, and he told me they were told it was for two reasons:\n\n1) Rising interest rates were cutting into the bottom line and they were concerned about runway (they had at least several years at the burn rate at the time).\n\n2) They lost their CTO, VP, and Director for the engineering side of things, and the rest of the executive board didn't want to handle a team of 16 engineers directly, so to make things easier they decided cutting the team in half made sense.\n\nIn the few months after the layoff, half of the remaining engineers left for other opportunities, taking the org down to just 4 engineers. Apparently this led to some panic with the execs, and they finally did what I and others wondered why they didn't just do in the first place: they promoted they very capable and well liked lead engineer to VP, giving them their delegation point.\n\nOne of the staff engineers who remained (who I worked with at my job before that one) said they were considering seeing if folks who were laid off might be interested in returning, and flat out asked me, \"If we offered to bring you back, would you?\" Told him I'd really have to think about it, but given the reasons for why the layoff happened I would have a hard time being willing to trust the company wouldn't do it again. He understood and that was the end of that conversation. Sucked too because if I would have been able to just slide back into my job there, as it was before, it would have been a $20k pay bump compared to the job I'd started a few weeks before that conversation took place.\n\nLayoffs lead to further attrition, and it's usually the most capable folks in the org who have avenues they can explore to leave. My manager, for example, gave notice a week after the layoff to go be the founding engineer of another company a buddy of his had started, and had been bugging him to join.\n\nThe entire reason I was at that job was the place I worked before laid off 20% of the company in early 2022, and the attrition afterwards was big. I survived that layoff, the first one I ever survived, but it sucked watching folks I absolutely enjoyed working with leave. Many of them ended up at one or two other companies, and I ended up at one of those companies when one of them suggested they reach out for me to expand engineering. Frustrated with the promotion process and not liking the new landscape of things, being able to interview for two hours (system design and leadership rounds to assess level, no coding) for a $25k pay bump was too tempting.\n\nThere are mental aspects to these things that linger, for everyone regardless of whether they were the ones let go or if they got to stay. I'm not saying layoffs should never happen or are never necessary, but for all the ones I've been through they definitely felt too reactionary and didn't consider the aftershock among those who remained.",

If you are making stuff up about doing things on the weekend, it’s going to be hard to feel out who shares similar interests. It’s kind of awkward after college to be like ‘You seem chill, wanna kick it sometime?’. It’s way easier to be like ‘I heard you were interested in doing X, I’ve been wanting to check it out’ and then it opens the door to invite them to do something together. But you can’t really do that if your not being genuine about your interests/how your spending your weekends.",

It wasn't a competitive thing, it was more like \"goddamn how did you do all of that?\".\n\nAnd IMO usually the Seniors have these traits:\n* mentioned above, they're always exceeding expectations\n* they can take ambiguity and figure it out and get it done\n* instead of asking to do something, they just do it\n* the don't have to be asked to mentor someone\n\nthat last bullet has a bit of a blurry line, some companies will make it a point for a Senior to be assigned to someone for mentorship. That being said, people are gonna come to you for guidance, you shouldn't deny that because you're not officially their mentor",

You still have to go in and iterate with it or adjust things by hand.\n\n2. Use cursor. Cursor has, for me, performed a lot better. Its ability to search through the codebase for context and examples is very helpful.\n\n3. Give it context. Point it in the direction of a similar test suite with patterns you want it to emulate. If you just tell it to write tests for Service X, it will do whatever it wants - which is usually not what you want. Point out patterns you want it to emulate (e.g., “Use fluent assertions and create separate expectation objects to compare results against”)\n\n4. Don’t trust the tests it creates. Testing is meant to find the cracks and AI is an agreeable little sycophant. It’s just trying to get tests to pass. So there’s a balance you need to find where you come up with how to test and the AI just writes it. Otherwise you’re in danger of coming up with tests that are meaningless but pass and create false coverage.",

Additionally, your prompts are probably lacking in detail so the AI has to jump to conclusions, similar to when you get a ticket without clearly defined criteria. My prompts for larger changes are usually about 2 or 3 good paragraphs.\n\nThere's 2 approaches to this:\n\n* learn how to provide all the necessary requirements and context so that an agent can do everything all at once\n* break up your work into small bite sized pieces and have the agent work on those one by one. AI is generally really good at small tasks so stringing them together can often prove to be pretty good.",

I read the code, to understand what it was doing differently. I read the little explainer it output. Then I deleted all the AI code I copied in and restored my original implementation. I then reread what I had. I understood my mistake. I modified a single line to return a reference instead of a copied value and it worked.\n\noddly enough, I do not find copilot, cursor, codex, claude, opencode or any other tool \"better\" than using AI like this. to me this is the best way to use it, to get 1 little kernel of \"knowledge\" if it can uncover it and then discard everything and make the change myself. i find all I want from AI is \"what am I missing in my understanding\" not \"give me the solution with me having zero understanding\"",

They have plenty of fully-BE and platform work (mostly Java/Kotlin or Go), but I don't know whether as a new grad you'd be able to steer you assignment towards it under the new system.\n\nTBH, I'd probably go for Bloomberg between those two because if you're willing to commute from Queens or a non-hipster part of Brooklyn.  As long as you're not trying to get an apartment Manhattan or a total spillover area, you can live a LOT better on $190k in NYC than you can for $175k in the Bay Area - SF and Manhattan are both ridiculously expensive, but rents in livable parts of NYC fall off in price a lot quicker than the Bay Area does, and you don't need to have the expense of a car.\n\nEdit to add: what is the Bloomberg comp breakdown?  Atlassian will be cash + stock + bonus (for new grads, both end-of-year and starting) while Bloomberg is not public.  That means Bloomberg is a more cash-heavy than Atlassian,  right?  \n\nThat can be a good or a bad thing depending on how much you see the upside in equity comp.  Personally, I'd choose the cash.",

I suspect your path to promotion is much slower in finance adjacent (at least, that's been my experience). But Atlassian's name will probably give you a slight edge on the resume if you're looking to move to another tech company in the future. If you think you'll stay in finance adjacent roles though, bbg is going to be very good for you.",

But she even discouraged me from taking a week of PTO for a once in a lifetime professional opportunity. (I don’t want to dox myself, but I was part of a professional organization in my spare time, who provided the opportunity. So it was “personal” and not directly job-related, but job-adjacent, and would have been a unique experience that probably less than 1,000 people in the country have had. I wasn’t in CS at the time). I deeply regret not pushing it. It’s honestly one of my biggest life regrets.\n\nI’ll never work a job again where there is any response to a PTO request other than “yes”.

Building things with words and watching the computer spring to life to do your bidding is magical, in a sense. Not enjoying that basic part early on says your tolerance for it might be too low for an industry that prides itself on burnout.\n\nHowever! There are a lot of cushy, well paying jobs in literally every field. And, in most of these jobs, you will find that having a working knowledge of scripting, data manipulation, and basic structures can give you a MASSIVE advantage.\n\nMy advice: find something you want to do. You’re 26. I’m sure you at least have interests that could point you toward something career wise.\n\nLove travel? Become a photographer or something that lets you utilize it. Use scripting to manage your catalogs more efficiently, making your website and portfolio presence stand out more with some web development, etc.\n\nI started out loving coding.\n\nThen, over the years, I started loving it less.\n\nThen it went to apathy.\n\nNow I actively dislike it.\n\nThis was only after ten years.

If you already don’t like it, maybe give it another six months to a year, but just bail. Do something else. Get a degree in something you want to do, or even a business degree and start your own company doing what you want to do. So many options. CS is not always the best.",

There’s a chance by the time you graduate, the market will be better, but there are no guarantees in life. \n\nThere is a general shift away from remote work. Hybrid is more popular these days, although there are some places going 5 days on-site. It won’t be impossible for you, just hard. There’s value being in-person, especially earlier in your career or time at a new company/team. \n\nYou don’t need to necessarily love programming, but you need some combination of competence and caring. When I say “caring,” I mean wanting to do a good job rather than half-ass it. You don’t need to work a million hours. There are a lot of really lazy devs out there. And a lot of people want to gatekeep the industry to those “who truly care.” I’m not trying to contradict myself. In latter scenario, caring means people who eat, live, and breathe tech. You can still be quite successful without that. \n\nThere are some online universities, if you really cannot stand your current state. There are about 3-4 that are regularly recommended, but their names escape me at the moment. Definitely a step above University of Phoenix. You will be getting a real degree. \n\nOne other thing to consider is some women don’t like tech working environments. Men in tech can be weird for several different reasons. You have the original nerd types, and now there are tech bros. There have been initiatives to increase the number of women in STEM, but YMMV how each company has done. \n\nI saw this post in another sub and thought it was interesting. It’s open to some interpretation. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1n5xc3s/im_told_that_our_engineeringfocused_culture_is/\n\nThere are also tech roles that are don’t require coding. But those are also very competitive, partially driven by a lower number of positions. ",

Tell your team there will be consequences for failing to meet agreed upon deadlines. They will need to get used to helping themselves. If not they will just sink.

For example, when you know people underestimate, why aren't you calling them out then and there? I don't mean it in a accusatory way, I mean are you aware of where the discrepancy is coming from, e.g. \"code complete\" vs \"rolled out 100%\", does it account for KTLO/distractions, high intensity work (focused dev) vs low intensity work (babysitting some request to another team), are there unspoken social pressure dynamics, etc. And have you articulated the impact of these heuristics on your team's estimation skills? I've literally had to tell people \"don't tell me the number you think I want to hear\", for example, when I smelled a \"going through the motions\" estimate.\n\nOn the code quality front, \"letting them failing\" is another way of saying to give people autonomy to potentially shoot their own foot (and then own up to it). Rather than taking over the driving seat, you can ask questions like \"what have you tried\" or \"have you considered X\" to put the bulk of investigation work back on their court and indicate that they own the outcome of that task.",

EM does a lot more in the realm of fielding requests for work coming from other teams. Understands our capabilities, commits us to work that is in our ballpark\n\nand so our tasks to start are usually very broad in definition, something like \"Add Drawer Login Component\" with really just the design files attached and some bigger acceptance criteria\n\nit's on us to break that down to the smaller manageable tasks, and point them as a group. Then they're just added to the queue for the sprint, that's what we've committed to. All unassigned.\n\nand so now, anyone can pick up any of those tasks, let's say given an assumption we all have similar skillsets. Maybe a junior picks up a task that is a little more difficult; they can either take on the challenge, or maybe a more mid or senior stops them and says - \"oh hey this might be a little more involved, but you can help me build this part of it\" and create another ticket.\n\nSo now we're all trusted to get the job done by doing all the discovery and now we have to work a little bit more together, and everyone has an idea of who's taking what. Junior A is prob waiting on bigger design things from Senior B before they can start. The senior would be inclined to prep the junior on what they have to do. or get them to focus on something else while Senior B finishes.\n\nYou, just kinda make sure that you're aware of the progress, and the more senior engineers are there to identify risks. And you need this teamwork to happen, in order for you to be able to focus on the more important things\n\nEngineers handle their own PR reviews, since they've been working more closely together they already have context of the changes, they've prob already done an initial once over, and things move a long quicker.\n\nanyway i think you get it but keep in mind this is the IDEAL state of things. I think it starts with assessing whether there is just too much on everyone's plate",

So far none of this has worked, still the first week of a 2 week sprint there are never any questions or concerns brought to me, and it’s not until the last few days of a sprint that crappy PRs start coming my way. \n\nI’ve had enough, so I just keep rejecting and commenting on the PRs and they keep rolling into next sprint which gets our scrum master all up in arms. I’m not their manager, but I’m one of only a handful of people whose approval is required on basically every PR.\n\nSo I’ve got my popcorn out and am watching what comes of all of this. Obviously to take this approach you have to be confident of your continued employment (which I am) and have the higher ups on board with your approach.

Azure is _more_ than thriving.\n\nSecond, look at the company in question’s health. Specifically, review their recent stock price history (if they are a publicly traded company), see if they are operating at a net loss, and read reviews from employees to see if there are any negative trends to watch out for if you were to join. (For example, if one employee review says that everyone backstabs each other, but the other 300 show nothing but praise, the backstabbing claim was most likely made from a bitter person who got fired, or at least it is very uncommon at that company. However, if more than half of the reviews indicate serious backstabbing problems, then yeah, that’s a major red flag.)",

        "body": "This is kind of a brain dump, but hopefully it helps:\n\nThere are four types of layoffs (at least):\n\n1. The company is doing bad and they need to cut costs to stay afloat\n\n2. Corporate greed - the company is doing perfectly fine but the shareholders aren't seeing enough profit so we're gonna lay a bunch of people off to get more \"efficient\", which actually means \"overwork the shit out of people\"\n\n3. Bloat - the company is doing fine, but there's a bunch of people that aren't actually working on projects that are valuable and the company can realistically not justify keeping them around\n\n4. A team is no longer necessary because the product/service/whatever they support is getting axed because it sucks - the rest of the company is fine\n\nAnd that is the order of how unappetizing it should be to join that company. A company that is struggling so much that it needs to lay people off is not necessarily a company that will turn it around because of the layoffs - things might get even worse after the layoffs.\n\nA company that is laying people off because of greed is going to have a horrendous work culture where people are going to have to work long hours, where a lot of knowledge will have recently left the company, etc. So you're not necessarily at risk of getting laid off, but you're going to be dealing with a pretty shitty work environment for a while.\n\nA company that allows bloat to happen now might allow bloat to happen again - if they aren't disciplined in their hiring, it means there's a risk that you might be the next bloat they get rid of. So this is going to be a role in which you're going to want to quickly make sure you're attaching yourself to valuable projects.\n\nAnd lastly - sometimes shit doesn't work out. We're seeing this with Amazon for example - you signed up to work on Alexa and now Alexa looks like it's going nowhere. It sucks, but sometimes you do need to get rid of like an entire department because it's just not what the company can justify. And as long as you're not joining a highly experimental arm of the company, this shouldn't really impact you much.\n\nI think by now there are very few companies that haven't done layoffs, and a company that is conservative enough to never overhire will have their own issues - namely, probably some stagnation and some lagging the market. Not always, but often.",

Stability of position may \"feel\" stronger and your psyche will appreciate it. The people will appear more at ease and will usually be more pleasant to work with.\n\nManagement will probably have a better vision and plan to steer the company. With a company doing layoffs expect lots of changes in direction and reorgs.\n\nSo basically, your thought exercise while not totally impossible is hinging on two assumptions: the company was hurting before and the layoffs are improving their standing, and that these companies would be even interested in hiring in the first place. If you were even able to get an opening at these companies, would you even want to work there? Maybe, but unlike a share of a company you purchase you have to live that work every day and suffer from the environment for your livelihood's sake:\n\nSource: survived several major layoffs at medium co for the last several years.",

Their internal recruiter told me towards the end of their process that my resume made me look like a \"startup junkie\", his exact phrasing, and he was concerned about whether I was really interested in working there or if it would just be safe harbor until I found another startup to work for. He also noted they couldn't pay as well as startups tend to pay.\n\nI just told him that two of the startups I worked for laid me off in under a year, and the middle one went public and fell off big time after that, so I wasn't exactly keen to stuck with that kind of volatility since I was married with a kid and a mortgage now, so something more straight forward and established sounded really good.\n\nNow, full disclosure? Total lie on my part. I did want stability, but I definitely saw them as a place to hold up while the market settled, but I would very likely be out of there when something better came along, even if it was a startup. Thing is he doesn't need to know that, and I just need him to believe me when I say that kind of work no longer holds appeal to me. They were willing to pay decently enough, I'd have benefits, and that's all I really cared about.\n\nDude was laid off from that place about a year later, and then I was laid off last October because of contract cuts and the consultancy being unable to land new clients. When I was on the bench it got 15 people deep by the time they dumped everyone on it.\n\nThe lesson is sometimes it's a matter of figuring out how to tell them what they want to hear, because in the end no one is really safe in this line of work. Land the job, get paid, and keep looking if you want.\n\nI'm with a new place now, been here nearly a year, and it's definitely more corporate, buuuuuuuuut I have a shot at a pension with this place so I'm actually angling to be here a long time, maybe even the rest of my career if I can manage it.\n\nYa just never know.",

So if asked how to solve the same problem, even at a high level, these people generally cant come up with an answer.\n\nThis results in a lot of suboptimal code as the developer settles for \"it works\" because they dont know how good code should look like. Right now AI is decently good, but in my experience, the more you have to keep re-prompting for changes, the worse and worse it gets. So not having a clear direction for what something should look like before engaging AI can sometimes lead to horrible code as you don't know how to course correct because you dont even know what the course is.\n\nAs a new junior developer, your work is probably very simple and things that AI can handle really really well. But as you progress in your career and tackle more complex issues that AI just isnt good enough at yet, you will need to have critical thinking and problem solving skills that I think you are not developing because you are so reliant on AI.\n\nThis ended up being a bit of a soap box for me, but tldr: solve the problem on your own and use AI as a faster typing interface so you can develop your problem solving skills better.",

For instance, unused imports? A little harmful to readability, but most compilers will disregard these anyway.\n\nOne recent example I've seen, is enforcing \"code deletions and additions must have test coverage\" on a large legacy/enterprise codebase. Effectively, what this means is that you either need a lead to sign-off on an exception (pretty easy to get), or that when you change the legacy functions, you must add enough test coverage to \"prove\" that it works.\n\nOtherwise, the scanners because just another step to the compiler. Probably okay to add in the beginning stages of a project, but quite burdensome to carte blanche add after a few years.",

        "body": "Hey, I’ve been through similar experiences and have a few opinions to share.\n\n1. You’ll improve code quality on the job. The alternative is to look at more code (open source) but I don’t recommend that unless you’re really passionate about it. Otherwise, it might add more stress. So, just try to criticize and improve your code base at work. Practice articulating what looks good and what looks bad, and why. Experiment with new ideas and you’ll learn faster. There are many signals to look out for in a codebase: does any part of your dev flow slow you down when building new features, are any parts confusing if a new dev were to work on it, do you have to update multiple places in code for a simple feature, etc. If you have few complaints then maybe your structure is solid after all. If you do identify issues, chances are that it’s something someone else ran into and found a solution for, so it’s always worth searching for how others approach things.\n\n2. The only way is to study and to practice. There are tons of online resources. One that I’ve used is GreatFrontEnd, but try googling or searching this sub to find some structured learning resources. Also, ChatGPT is a great tool to ask dumb questions and get good feedback. Chat is also a great tool to ask your exact question : “how do I rebuild my fundamentals in a structured way.”\n\n3. Similar answer: study and practice, using online resources. I’ll bet you know a lot more than you give yourself credit for, but maybe don’t have the language to articulate ideas. Again, you can treat AI tools as a dev buddy: before developing a feature, create your rough design idea and ask Chat for feedback. (Typically this would be done with colleagues, but if you don’t have other devs as resources, AI is a solid tool imo.)\n\n4. I recommend stopping your weed consumption until you feel less anxious about your career. If you can’t cut it out completely, I recommend reserving it for a specific time and in smaller doses, like at night after all responsibilities are done for the day and you’re ready to wind down for bed. This is a nice middle ground because quitting cold turkey can lead to relapse and a negative spiral. Reserving it for night time only is a guilt-free window for you. This way, you’re using weed as a reward rather than a coping mechanism. Just make sure you have a solid and consistent waking schedule. :)\n\n5. This is more life advice than just career advice: we’re human beings with finite time in this life. You’ll never have time for everything so a good skill to learn is time management. With this career revamp you’re working on, write out everything that’s on your mind, and then choose the ones of highest importance (it’s subjective and only you can decide that). For each item that you’ve prioritized and deemed important enough to focus on, break it down into smaller chunks. Rinse and repeat until you have less overwhelming and more actionable tasks. And most importantly, do the tasks! If they’re small enough to complete, it helps you psychologically build momentum. If tasks seem daunting it’s usually because they feel more ambiguous and that’s when our minds resort to coping strategies (like smoking weed or scrolling on your phone). In these cases it’s okay to dive in and try things out until it feels less ambiguous, and from there you can continue the process of identifying and breaking things down into a todo list (aka backlog).\n\nOne last thing, I’d recommend looking into therapy as an additional resource. I know that it can be expensive and might feel useless, but here’s my take on it: it’s not some sort of silver bullet solution to all your problems. If you can consider “cutting down on weed and strengthening my SWE foundation” as a long-term project, then therapy is a great resource to use along the way. It’s similar to what you did here, you posted how you were feeling and some advice and strategies were recommended. But with consistent therapy, each session is like a check-in: here’s what we talked about last time, here’s what I tried, and here’s where I struggled. It’s a continuous, iterative development process, much like how we build good software products!\n\nGood luck, you’ve got this!",

In terms of transitioning understanding the domain you’d be working in is as important if not more so than your technical experience, so if you can find an SA role that is focused on the industry you work in now that’s probably the best way to get your foot in the door. Interview process was relatively easy, not highly technical. I was asked to describe in detail my technical work on my resume to basically check that I have a basic level of technical skill and can approach a new project, do research, build any required new skills, and execute, but no leetcode or anything. Obviously being personable and charismatic is relatively important as well. \n\nI’m at a Mag7 company. I believe SAs here are paid roughly 10% less than equivalent level SWEs but the pay is more than double what I was making in my last job at a Fortune 25 non-tech company as a SWE. WLB here is good with the caveat being that any SA role is likely going to require some travel. I’ve traveled approximately 6 times in the last year which isn’t terrible but I have colleagues who are traveling once a month or more.\n\nI’d say career trajectory is good, in my company SA has a high level of visibility, and because it’s a very versatile role that spans sales, product, and engineering I think it would be fairly easy to transfer into TPM or engineering from here. I don’t personally find the work as fulfilling as SWE but I also think that’s partially because I haven’t quite hit my stride yet. I have zero regrets about the transition in because of what I gained financially. I may try to transfer into a SWE role once I’m able to though.",

It just sort of happened because those teams took me in early career and it just... sort of kept going on like that since then.\n\nI am purposely rerouting to full stack side from purely BE as I am noticing more and more job postings want full stack (so doing best to adapt to the job market for future job searches).\n\n>what factors helped you choose your path\n\ntbh, I don't know. I think for most of my career, I didn't know much so I just adapted given the work I was given. And I never really gave much of a thought. It's really difficult to know anything early career and all I knew during college was I absolutely wanted to avoid networking, C++, OCaml, machine learning. Looking back now, I feel thinking in absolutes is not good and I should have given those fields a try.\n\nI did do data engineering side (more niche) early on but quickly pivoted away because I noticed data side was going to get paid less than general engineering (the trend was dying and the number of job postings were too slim so I escaped while I could early career).\n\n>How has this decision impacted your job security, compensation growth, and day-to-day satisfaction?\n\nJob Security - Feels nonexistent. I think this is the worry with generalists. I am way too easily replaceable by offshoring as offshore infra matures more and more. I wish I would have specialized and am doing my own sort of specialization in some ways (explained later on).\n\nCompensation Growth - Leaves to be desired. If I could redo I would have run immediately to Machine Learning. The pay premium is so much greater. It's noticeably more. Basically about $80\\~200k more a year when you are senior/staff. And career growth (promos) seem much faster for more niche fields. For instance for those in security or ML, they can get external Google Senior offer at 5 YOE. A generalist might need 10 YOE in comparison and get paid worse.\n\nDay to day satisfaction - I find working with motivated coworkers with a decent manager is what sets the day to day satisfaction. Not the type of work I do.\n\n>specializing in a niche vs being a generalist?\n\nWhile my skills are generalist, I am 'specializing' in business domain. That's how I plan on 'buffing' (?) my resume. So while my coding skills are generalist, the domain I am working on is becoming more specialized.\n\nI definitely noticed how helpful that was when doing a job search recently.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025\\_job\\_search\\_2\\_month\\_long\\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025_job_search_2_month_long_results/)\n\nApplied 18 companies and 15 gave interviews. All 3 that didn't respond were for generalist roles that were far off from my business domain. And the 1 recruiter who ghosted me after recruiter call was also for a role far outside the business domain I worked on.\n\nIf anything, I noticed throughout the interview process the jobs that were closely in lined to business domains basically just gave me offers (freebies). It's a huge advantage to have experience in closely related niche fields.\n\nI say specialize early on in potential in-demand fields if you can because the ones with high barriers of entry like GPUs, AI inference, etc are extremely difficult to offshore. And basically have no competition once you have sufficient experience (best for job security). And can command huge premiums in the market as you become senior+ (+ promos are easier and quicker).\n\nIf you cannot specialize like that and you are a generalist, at least specialize on the business domain. Why wouldn't a hiring manager pick someone who is exposed to similar business domains over some random candidate who worked on something completely different? That said do keep in mind generalists are the most replaceable so offshore worries will be a bigger threat over time. :/\n\n**I honestly feel generalist just sucks. Most easily replaceable/offshore-able.** **Specialize in what companies need but cannot find. It's all supply demand and promos/compenstions do reflect such as well.** **Have knowledge in many stuff but be deep in 1 topic.**\n\nIn a bad economy, also keep in mind while generalists can apply everywhere, specialists (in domain or busines knowledge) will be first in line for those jobs. So you do get screwed in job searches as a pure generalist.\n\nKeep in mind specialist in some outdated garbage is the worst of all worlds.",

That's an interesting topic to get into, too.\n\nMyself, I've serially specialized in both my roles and what industries/segments I've been focused on. In both cases I've tried to get as deep in the speciality as practical.  Roles: backend dev, product manager, project manager, software & systems architect, no-hands-on people manager. Bouncing from one to another hasn't held me back. I honestly couldn't say which I enjoyed more and the world needs all of them. \n\nWith industries, I specialized in systems (primarily app servers and orch platforms), dev tools, data agg/monetization, and vertical search engines. That might not seem like a huge range, but each of them are pretty specialized and their first choice is to hire people from their own space, so the segments are a factor.\n\nI don't think specialization necessarily holds you back from making changes. As a hiring manager, for a mid-/senior dev I want to see people have been in 3-6 companies in at least 2 industries over 4 to 12 years digging as deep into whatever they were doing at the time to be great at it. I want the experience that comes with it. Diversity of experience is very good.\n\nLong story short, I vote for doubling-down, but occasionally pivoting.",

Think about times you helped junior devs or onboarded someone, even informally.\n\nI would recommend preparing with some mock interview tools. I've done the same—at least for someone like me who gets anxious a lot, they really help. There are multiple tools available; I tried Final Round AI's mock interview, and it's quite good.\n\nDon't oversell your impact too much, they can smell BS from a mile away. Focus on specific technical decisions you made and why, that's what separates senior from mid level anyway.",

For example, tell me about a time you couldn’t get consensus on something. You could say, I got feedback. How is by holding a meeting, getting feedback from a doc, one on one questions. Why is because it’s good to offer many avenues of feedback. Etc. \n\nNext, if you can, be sure to listen to the interviewer and offer ways to help them if possible. For example, after they ask you this question, you could ask, have you been having a hard time getting consensus on your team? What a coincidence, I got consensus all the time with these strategies, here’s how I dealt with disagreements, etc.",

Things I genuinely cared about.\n\nThere's a \"greater picture\" that I picked up over time. Talking about what I like and dislike in tech stacks, how we don't always get to use the technology we want, never enough hours in the day to do everything we want, how I've held offshore accountable but no micro-managed them, how I never complained about 5am deployments because I don't want to burden someone else, how I brought new hires up to speed when there's no set program, etc.\n\nAll stuff I picked up with work experience. Nothing I read on a message board or guide. I don't force any of those topics into the interview but I go into them if related to the conversation. It's a long list.\n\nI try to come across as semi-entertaining. The interviewer should like listening to me speak. I sound confident.

Computed properties are so nice to use, fetching and maintaining reactive data is a breeze.\n\nNow, we all now the job market is in the toilet. My current job uses Vue, but we've had so many layoffs that the teams are now severely understaffed and replaced by people who have no idea. The job has become unbearable.\n\nI've been looking for other jobs. Not only is the job market terrible, but I've seen comments about FE roles decreasing around 10% YoY, mostly thanks to AI. The few FE jobs that are out there require React, almost no one is looking or considering a developer with a Vue background.\n\nI do not like React. And have no energy to transition to Fullstack in my free time. But it seems like I have no choice than to bite the bullet and adapt, or remain unemployed once my job axes me as well.\n\nAny words of comfort or advice would be greatly appreciated.",

I have been called a high performer and even told that I was the SWE that they compared others to in the company.  The company was a private non-tech company in non-tech city.\n\nThe bar was pretty low for entry as we didn't compete for talent hat could get jobs at actual tech companies.  I may have been a \"high performer\" at this company, but realistically I was still a pretty shit SWE with 15 YOE when compared to SWEs at actual tech companies.\n\n> had disagreements with management that ended up costing me my job. \n\nDepending on what the disagreements are management may be in the right.  I lost a job because of \"disagreements\", but it basically came down to I called the out on their shit.  There as a lot of lip service to burnout and shit like that, but nothing every changed because the \"project is too important\".\n\nThe project is so important that we were 15 months late getting FDA approval on the medical devices and still got a company party celebrating the victory.  Never mind there was 0 effort to figure out why were were late as to no repeat mistakes.  It was probably the right decision to just let me go.   \n\nFunny thing was, after the left me go over the next 10 months 5 out of 7 Senior SWEs left along with 2 other midlevel SWEs. \n\n> I am already struggling to get responses since losing my job. I know I need to be prepared to be job searching for 6 months, but other people I talk to that have experience seem to have no problem having recruiters reach out or getting responses/interviews.\n\nIt's a tough market out there and everybody is different.  Maybe you are not marketing your value well on your resume or applying to the wrong jobs.  If you are only looking at top tech companies then you have to expect competition for people working at other top tech companies.\n\nI have also been looking for a new job over the last couple of years and this year I got very few calls to interview from my applications.  I worked on safety critical medical devices for 15 years and have lead teams over that time in addition to being an IC.   I'm basically an embedded application SWE working with mostly c and c++ which is not really what the industry wants.\n\nIt's not even an issue of only wanting remote work as I am more than happy to go into the office, but sadly I cannot just relocate anywhere due to family reasons.  That doesn't mean no relocation, but the city needs to be a place the whole family is in on or people are going to have a bad time.\n\n>So far, I have gotten nothing but 2 rejections (no interview), and 2 ATS rejections from LinkedIn easy apply jobs. I'm not just using easy apply, but maybe something is wrong with my resume?\n\nThat's nothing you have barely started interviewing.\n\n>I'm not just using easy apply, but maybe something is wrong with my resume? \n\nPost your resume in the resume review thread or on resume review subreddits to get feedback.  Things like use STAR and show impact is a common comment.\n\n>Is the job market just that toast right now, even for people that have a little bit of work experience? \n\nCompanies are hiring, but the supply of candidates is large and hiring managers are being selective.  They feel the need a close to perfect fit because if you are not it then somebody else probably is.   \n\n>Is it because its the end of the year and about to be holiday vacation time?\n\nProbably part if it as hiring slows down around the holidays and picks up in the new year.",

If the goal is the raise, better to do a good job on the higher-order tasks and argue you're performing at the higher level.  If the goal is not being overwhelmed, better to simply raise the bandwidth issue and ask for prioritization.  \"I'll do it but you have to pay me more first\" is going to sour your relationship with them and probably not get what you want.",

I have worked with consultants who were smart and have gone on to work for big tech so it depends on each individual career trajectory.  But most end up being master of none as they move between projects. It takes years to develop expertise in any tech stack working on a specific problems, say develop a delivery app. Increase the $$$ to attract the right candidate and filter accordingly.",

What happens is they place you with clients that are \"easier\" and can be satisfied by a consultant consistently missing deadlines or one that isn't acclimated to being on the bleeding edge of technology. Because of this there's a sorta schism in the talent pool for consulting. My advice is to really read into their resume and figure out if it's fluff (it usually is). During the first round, be sure to pay close attention to how they talk about previous work. This won't solve all of your problems, but I do hope it provides some clarity to the quality of candidates you get.",

I have never been at a company where anyone really got up to speed in less than six months. If it's a large company, a fast-moving company, or both, it can take closer to a year.\n\nTwo: We are all our own worst critics. We see all of our deficits and fuckups. Meanwhile, when we see other people's work, it's because they landed something, solved some problem, gave some slick presentation, etc. Don't compare yourselves to others. You will invariably be comparing your messy practice sessions to their greatest hits.\n\nThree: When the great jazz guitarist Pat Metheny was asked by an interviewer how he got so good, he responded \"easy, I made sure I was the worst guy in every band I was in.\" Talk to the people whose work you admire. Ask them how they think about problems. If you see a slick piece of code or a clever solution, give it the old \\`git blame\\`, figure out who wrote it, and message them saying it's cool and asking how they came up with it. Pay attention in code reviews. Get a mentor who is more senior in the same org and role as you. Even if you are the worst guy in the band right now, *that's the position where you do the most improving*.\n\nI've been where you are now, and it sucks, but it doesn't suck forever. Stick it out, ask lots of questions, and trust that you'll get better with time.",

Last the year the US graduated [170,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86rdUhx-b4U&t=532s) CS majors, up from [50,000](https://archive.is/mPNcX) in 2012.\n\nNo one cares your side projects unless they go viral. No one will look at a GitHub you list on your resume that could easily be plagiarized. HR doesn't code. Can code on your own if you want to learn tech stacks but no need to polish for sharing.\n\nYou're seeking entry level work. You just have to know the basics. Most of CS is work experience. Your #1 goal is to get an internship in any part of CS. Oh you know this. If you don't, your odds of having a job at graduation tank. You're competitive applying in your 3rd semester for the upcoming summer.\n\nAn AI job is not an impossibility with work experience but the real AI work requires graduate school education. Can be in CS or Electrical or Computer Engineering. Entry level job might masquerade it's AI to bait and switch you. Oh you can use GitHub Copilot, big whoop.\n\nUniversity prestige is very important for consideration of internships and entry level jobs, then maybe never matters again. If you're US, I call Tier 1 a Top 40 or 50 program or #1 or #2 in your state. If you're at shit tier, you need to transfer up. You're not going to have 200+ companies recruiting on campus for CS and engineering students and HR is more likely to not read your resume.\n\nFor now, make good grades, apply yourself and pursue what you're passionate about, whether in CS or not. Recruiters like seeing passion. I was into camping and hiking. Hackathons are a decent use of your time. Working with others is a valuable skill, both in general and to recruiters.",

Especially applying for full time positions, a single internship with relevant experience to what you’ll be doing in the position you’re applying for is worth WAY more than a degree from like CMU, MIT, Stanford, GT, etc. \n\nThat said, these places might get you better connections, but at the end of the day you can make up having a less prestigious school in your resume by having strong projects and or internship and co-op experience. Also once you get your first real position, no employer really  cares about what school you went to or what your GPA is. \n\nIf you’re interested in graphics programming, I would start with picking up a book on OpenGL and actually building stuff. Possibly using something like Open3D. \n\nAs for if you should get your Masters, I would look now at the types of jobs you would like to apply for after you finish school. If most of them require a master’s degree, then yeah get it now. Speaking from experience it’s way easier to get it straight away than trying to go back. I tried after i started working full time and my wife and I had just started a family and finishing my masters program was more than I can handle. So if you think you might want to and you have the means to do it, I would say do it now while your brain is still in “school mode” and you don’t have a bunch of other extra responsibilities to balance. The other alternative is to get in somewhere that will pay for your master’s, but that seems to be increasingly rare nowadays.",
