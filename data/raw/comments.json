We have spent decades trying to build deterministic systems that give the right answer every time but effectively we are throwing a probabilistic system on top that will add to the error rate.  Their expectation is that you one shot determine the correct answer every time and that's never going to happen no matter how much you tune  it, add agents or whatever.  The best you can do is reduce the error rate, but that takes some serious work with experienced people, not just something you get out of the box from some crap tool or whatever.\n\nAlso the context of how the LLM got to that answer that it gives is often SQL and that's gibberish to most business users, so they can't even evaluate whether something that \"looks weird\" is actually correct or it's an obvious mistake in the SQL construction.  Personally I think AI is great for tasks in which the user can evaluate the output from their knowledge like doc retrieval with links, coding assist, etc.  But we are not at a point where we can blindly trust answers from AI.\n\nKinda related, we had a call with a company that was offering some kind of vibe coding tool for data engineering.  You feed it a bunch of context and it would build your pipelines with an agentic model (orchestrator/workers from what I could tell).  I asked the question of how it could get to understand your source systems when the documentation is often lacking.  They said the expectation was that you had full documentation for your systems that you could feed to the tool.  I almost laughed because I have never actually seen that anywhere outside of  maybe a small biz that only uses Salesforce or something.",

Out of curiosity, what did you try building? \n\nI haven’t done this myself yet, but something I hope to experiment with soon: build an MCP server that scans your metadata and samples the data so that it “understands your database”. You can then, in theory, hook that up to Copilot or some other LLM as the MCP host. There are probably good and bad ways of doing this, but it should in theory be doable. Someone on this sub recently posted that that they had successfully implemented this (I give this sub slightly more credence than LinkedIn lunatics).\n\nTo those concerned about OP feeding private data to public LLMs: enterprise LLM products exist (ChatGPT Enterprise, GitHub Copilot, etc) and they typically have privacy/security guarantees, or so I’m told. This type of setup should only be used with those, obviously. \n\nAll that being said, the most successful use case of such a setup would probably be the data team having more intelligent/aware AI coding assistants, eg using an agent to build you a pipeline that isn’t just guessing at your schemas. As for your stakeholder… I still don’t understand why some people think a fancy randomness machine will give better results than a simple SQL query, which is a straightforward and deterministic way to pull the data one needs.",

You can find software engineers specializing in multiple different specificities but they’re still someone who writes code to solve a problem. Same for DEs: they write code and design systems to solve data problems. Analyzing data and working with business requirements around data systems is also part of it. Creating reports can also be part of it (although that’s more of a data analyst thing in my opinion).\n\nGenerally you will find multiple different realms of data engineering when looking for jobs. To me it sounds like you need to be more specific with yourself about what exactly it is that you are interested in within DE (is it writing Spark ETL jobs? Is it writing SQL pipelines? Is it working with Kafka/streaming systems?) and then filter your job search based on that.",

Data engineering is hard - we can’t afford the risk of bringing on too junior people so we want proven experience.\n\nI think my only advice for you is even if you are able to job hop like you seem to be, I think it’s wise to spend your first years of your career building solid skills from solid experiences.

That gives you the performance and safety of CDC without forcing a real-time architecture where it’s not needed.\n\nSo yeah, real-time extraction doesn’t mean real-time everything.

        "body": "You need to see every state change.\n\nTake a CRM with a customer issue workflow. The issue may bounce between a variety of states through the day, and the CRM doesn't log all of the information related to the state change at the time it was made into a fully comprehensive audit log. This is even a reason why the system might have CDC enabled -- so that this in depth functionality is offloaded from the system.\n\nAlternatively, getting account balance and related details in a banking system on each transaction. Transactions may not log the actual remaining balance at the time, that's just on the account table. You might want analyses on lowest/highest value on account even during the day, or the amount of time spent below a balance level or in arrears.\n\nAll sorts of tables live system back ends may provide better information if all their state changes are logged to a full history table.\n\nYou might not necessarily *need* this now, but I've seen business want to convert to faster update frequencies and/or finer granularity pretty frequently. It is generally not that much more difficult to set up, and once you have the pattern set once it is just repeated for every other table.\n\nDoing it by default makes later development much easier. If it saves the work of just a single person for just one week in an entire year, that could be worth $10k/yr. Is the marginal cost of the full history more than that? Does it save so little development time? What if an ask for finer grained data came in for more tables? What's the lost value of all the data you *didn't* collect?\n\n---\n\nSpeed / latency and flexibility\n\nIf you bring this into a bronze style append-only log table, you have access to all the data essentially immediately. Any use case that could ever use just the latest state information without having to burn down the core database with excessive queries to get it will want to hit this instead. You can be constantly ingesting this data.\n\nYou don't have to integrate it into SCD2 tables constantly though. You could do that daily, or hourly, or every 15 minutes, or skip it on weekends, or do it monthly, or on demand. Because the incoming data is a full change log it doesn't matter how often you run the process, it works the exact same way. It isn't like snapshots where you have to run each snapshot individually and sequentially in order to get the correct behaviour for building a history, and you run into issues when you have to skip a day due to the source system having a planned outage because your DQ checks throw up errors that you're missing a snapshot.\n\n---\n\nEfficiency with actual slow changes\n\nIf only a small proportion of the data is changing over a given snapshot period, then you don't need to be sending the 10x, 100x, 1000x, or 10_000x data volume of the full snapshot just to make the state change (including deletes) calculable. You can get away with sending significantly less data.\n\nIf your integration process to SCD2 or other tables is set up properly, you can also get away with significantly less processing. Only the primary keys in the latest CDC slice will be updated, and only for SCD2 records that are currently active (or end after the CDC slice starts). You can filter the target table for the appropriate date range then semi-join on the primary keys to limit what you're working with. I've had this cut down the amount of data being processed when compared to snapshots by ~95%\n\n---\n\nAutomation and concurrent uses\n\nCDC is useful for all sorts of ways to use a database, and it is a fairly generic feature. Rather than maintaining lots of manual queries to snapshot data and then having to write more scripts to export it and transfer it, some SaaS come with built-in CDC processes where you can direct the data to be emitted to lake storage, or to an event system like Kafka. It may be significantly easier for the ops team for the original database to just enable CDC and point it to somewhere you can access, rather than managing and tweaking an in-house snapshot setup.\n\nIf the CDC is being evented out low latency as it occurs, it could also have multiple consumers. There may be other processes around the business that want to follow along on data level changes to trigger alerts or workflows, so that the business doesn't have to dig into the guts of a SaaS or overload the development team. If they're setting this up anyway, there's no need to then set up another redundant process for another team, they can just pull the CDC like anyone else.\n\n--- \n\nCaveat\n\nIf the data is changing extremely rapidly and outpaces the size of a daily snapshot, then you're probably not really looking at something that's typically usable as an SCD2 table, or at least one where it probably isn't helpful. You can often just have an append-only table for the CDC if all the data are essentially inserts, as would be the case for banking transactions for example. Or you might want to initially ingest into an append-only table, then on a daily run grab the last change per primarty key before midnight to generate a daily snapshot delta.\n\nIn any case, for almost everything you receive, always put it into an append-only table first, then work with it from there. It almost always make later processing easier and more efficient, it really helps with being able to test or scope out changes on real data, and if anything ever goes wrong with the integrated (eg SCD2) data then you've got an essentially immutable copy that you can rerun and restore from.",

Yes, in the end, it's a logic table persisted in your database. Since the logic table is defined in a formatted way, it gives extra meaning for your LLM model to inference.

It's similar to yaml with some small differences. You can make a job manually in databricks and past the job into a terraform file with some minor changes. Might want a separate file for each job.\n\nLook into medallion architecture. Bronze jobs are mostly for reading from data sources with a checkpoint file so you can pick up where you left off. Bronze tables just exist as a raw source of truth. Maybe you split one raw table into others for different kinds of messages, but you don't really process the data. In silver, you deduplicate, normalize, and clean the data. Then, you may have some \"gold\" table or views at the end which are heavily joined, denormalized (i.e. \"read optimized\") for consumption by dashboards or BI.\n\nI've jumped into situations where people didn't understand the medalion pattern and it led to some poor design choices that created confusion and difficulty.\n\nLearn how to check those .py style notebooks into version control.

A properly designed set of aggregates should behave like database indexes, which accelerate query performance but are not encountered directly by the BI applications or business users.

IMO this never should have happened and I ended up stepping back to senior. This has hurt me in some respects trying to find my next role but that's off topic\n\nWith no awareness of cloud tooling I originally built a skillset in SSIS. Weirdly - maybe due to the fact that I was still largely a dev day to day - nobody would give me the time of day when I tried to find roles in that area from like 2018 onwards. I largely credit COVID/full remote/zero interest rates and the explosion of hiring for even getting interviews for cloud native jobs as my dev job never had cloud native options. I still wonder if I'd have even broken into the field at all without that\n\nAs to how I'm managing - I've really been on the \"learn outside of work to the point of burnout\" trail for the last 3 years. I was a SQL heavy dev so no issues there but I still don't think I know enough about anything else. This gets more complicated because my current role is analytics for security teams so I'm also doing SIEM work and chasing security certifications...\n\nI always get by in my roles by being passable at things the teams I work in can't even get started. As a data engineer that's been teaching everyone Git, CI/CD, and infrastructure stuff, or in my current team doing actual security work in the SIEM/SOAR space\n\nI've written far too much but there's lots to share I guess.

Thus, I'm on the opposite side of the opinion spectrum here. I see that updating your business data once a day might be a bit slow, but wouldn't every, say 5min, be totally fine?\n\nIn parallel you're mentioning metrics for system outages. From my point of view, those shouldn't be part of your CDC workflow, but rather in Monitoring system, e.g. Datadog. Could you elaborate here a bit, on what you envision here?",

Multiple excel tabs instead of 1 expected tab?\n\nEssentially my point is the folks creating the raw data that you then ingest as \"raw\" data in bronze layer are often times front desk staff who dont know what excel even is - there is huge variance. We can't reject every other row in real life, that data needs to be cleansed and ingested/used for x purpose(s) (because we pay for it, or responsibility to load it or whatever the use case is). \n\nWhat you've built is really cool, and teams out there would pay you big bucks to get this sort of pipeline operating efficiently, assuming you can course correct for the above scenarios.",

You can store all of the data in GCS or S3, saving a fair amount of money depending on the amount needed to transfer.

For the bigger ones use editions/slots/capacity pricing or whatever they call paying for a vCPU. Split these into different GCP projects with distinct pricing options (one for slots, one for on demand)\n- don’t reinvent the wheel with custom queries for monitoring usage and hacky dashboards for costs but use something like mastheaddata.com to get insight per consumer (e.g. Looked, Fivetran, dbt) and pricing optimizations per query.",

Be careful while googling!!\n\nThe reason high concurrency mode was important in databricks -at the time- was because the \"interactive\" clusters sent the driver of all jobs thru a dedicated driver node and it doesn't scale well when lots of jobs are running at the same time.  My recollection was that there was deliberate synchronization performed, for the benefit of interactive scenarios involving human operators.

For CPU-bound crunching-tokenization, matrix algebra, image hashes-compile to WASM and call it from the warehouse; it’s faster than spinning up Spark just for one function and sidesteps Python’s GIL. External UDF servers shine when you already have a service in production, e.g., calling a fraud score API, but watch network latency and cache aggressively. I’ve used BigQuery remote functions and Snowflake external functions for these patterns; DreamFactory handled the auto-generated REST layer when we needed to expose those services without hand-rolling APIs.

If you do get forced to cleanse or transform any data you must have the business and project agree that this will break any ability to do data verification, and you can only therefore rely on counts of data and inference of 'completeness'\n\nYou'll never get away with having a migration project that actually follows sense and logic, you will be the only person in the room arguing why transforming data in a migration is completely wrong, and you will be spoken to like you are the idiot in the room for it.\n\nYou can only cover your back by making sure:\n\n* You get agreement for everything\n* You document every row of data that falls out of expectation at the source\n* Plan in multiple entire migration data runs leading up to the go live data\n* Never ever be quite about best practice. The conversations will make you want to quit, but never under any circumstances lose your integrity just because you're in a room of people who don't understand.",

I won't get into them here, but say for instance Fuzzy Matching is involved. Sometimes the fraud team will keep these secret since if folks were aware of the nature of the detection analytics they could circumvent them. I'm referring to sophisticated stuff you can't really do this in PowerBI, not basic calculations or lookups. \n\n- If this access is absolutely necessary, the fraud team should make every effort to limit who on their team can view the data, they should have procedures for granting access, and document who has access and who approved it, ie I wouldn't advise a \"free-for-all\" but I would be pretty upset if PII was restricted. \n\n- I had access because I was one of the 'trusted few' at the company. I was maybe one of 10~ employees out of 100k employees who had the level of access needed to conduct this work, the others being legal, the CEO, CFO, etc. There were maybe 50+ other folks in my org, but the PII was masked for the rest of the employees. They could download aggregated statistics from dashboards, but not the PII or row-level data. \n\n- You may want to involve in-house Legal. Anytime I granted access to the raw PII data, we involved legal. \n\n- There are excel-level controls, like encryption and security, you can tell the team must be enabled anytime they send an email - we did this as a policy. There's no real way to enforce it, but we'd always encrypt the emails and the excel file if we ever shared it. \n\n- On that note, aren't there controls in your company which monitor the sending & sharing of Excel documents? ie if it is ever exported to a flash drive or printed? \n\n- Speculating here - I think Microsoft has a data governance tool, Purview, which might detect things like PII containing columns and restrict the sharing of the excel report? Might want to look into that. I briefly used it but can't speak to its applicability or effectiveness in this situation. \n\nJust my thoughts - could also maybe learn from them exactly what procedures they need to do in excel and see if you can design queries to handle it? I could see the financial industry being a bit more sensitive than where I worked so, these controls might not be enough.",

Your instinct about Postgres being easier on the dev side is spot on the SQL compatibility makes the migration much smoother.But honestly, with 87TB of highly relational data and that schema structure you described, I'd lean towards Postgres here. few reasons: The relational nature of your order management system is gonna fight you every step of the way with Mongo. Sure, sharding comes easier but you'll end up with a mess trying to handle all those one-to-many relationships across collections. Plus your devs will hate life trying to rewrite all that logic.\n\nFor active-active with Postgres, yeah its more work upfront but:\n\n\\- Citus handles the sharding pretty well for this scale\n\n\\- pglogical or BDR can handle the multi-master stuff \n\n\\- Your existing queries won't need major rewrites\n\nThe 15M users across US east/west is definitely doable with either but given your schema complexity I think you'll save months of dev time sticking with relational.\n\nOne thing to watch out for tho - active-active with financial transaction data gets tricky with conflict resolution. Make sure you have a solid strategy for handling concurrent updates to the same order records across regions.\n\nWhat's your timeline looking like for this migration? That might influence which route makes more sense from a project management perspective            Also curious about your read/write patterns are customers mostly reading their order history or do you have heavy write loads during peak ordering times?",

        "body": "Upfront disclosure - I work at MongoDB. But I’ll fully upvote every comment that says you’ll have to redevelop most backend code to use MongoDB. Fact! \n  \nOn the other hand - an Order Management use case is perfectly suited to the MongoDB document model. Your data is not highly relational; it is highly structured. A customer places orders, and orders contain items. That can be entirely achieved in a single collection with nested fields in MongoDB. The performance will be superior. There is rarely a need for transactions in MongoDB - use a flexible document to capture the reads atomically, and if you need to update other collections that contain values use change streams. Jumping across 87TB in relational tables is inherently less efficient. \n\nGoing further, if you use MongoDB Atlas, I’d expect you can use the built in archive for a majority of the customer data (orders >6 months go to archive?), adding minimal latency degradation (+1-2s? Vs sub 100ms for hot data) and massive savings, with no added code. That could half the size of your cluster and costs. But at worst, for the near hundred TB of data, you are looking at a 25 shard cluster which would be active-active and could accept east/west geo-specific writes\n\nGoing even further, how does your order management support search? Atlas will provide you order search capability within the same cluster or with dedicated search nodes. And vector search. And all of this is Highly Available starting with 4 9s of uptime with options to increase to 5 9s. \n\nSo if your C-Suite is weighing in with technical requirement (active-active) - my suggestion is ask them what the business requirement is - uptime, latency - and steer them back towards doing their jobs and letting you do yours ;). And ask them what value lucene search would provide to users? \n\nAnd then returning to the reason for you not to use MongoDB Atlas - you will have to refactor more code. But we do offer purpose built genAI refactoring solutions to help customers achieve this. DM me or check our website. End Users can even Experiment with “Relational Migrator” but you’ll need custom or some of our internal tooling to migrate 87 TB. Good luck!",

For heavier processing that takes many hours/days typically you might look at Apache Sedona, a spark fork designed for geospatial processing.  Based on your example though it sounds like you could probably get away with parquet files or some cheap cloud columnar DB implementation.\n\nWe do similar stuff at the billions of rows scale (no geocoding though), with spatial indexing and location points on Snowflake.

Leave the technology selection and named individuals etc for project/programme world. \n\nEach strategy will be different due to the current context helping you to identify the goals you want to go for. The last one I wrote just a few months back targeted a change in operating model. Mainly due to a lot of pain points coming from heavy IT, engineering led decisions and a complete lack of governance. \n\nThere's plenty of bad examples out there but the MOD and NASA strategies are ideal I've linked to a few below with elements I rate as being good. They focus on principles and goals. The strategies which focus on \"we need to move to databricks\" or \"data governance process will look like this\" is not a strategy. \n\nOnce the context, vision, goals and objectives are in place you simply lay out a roadmap for the next X years and this is then used to kick off the initiatives in the business to deliver on the strategy. Again, this is why it's a strategy and why it leads you simply in a direction to fix where you are.\n\nThe people hired, the architecture patterns, the solutions chosen and tech changes all use the strategy vision, principles and goals to keep aligned.

What's going to happen next?\n4. What do we do about it?\n\nLuckily, those things build on each other and can help you prioritize your work. For example, first standing up simple reporting and over time growing that into predictions and recommendations. That last part is where a data team really shows its value.\n\nYou can extend, or alternatively, start this thinking by considering who your data team's end users or customers are now and, just as important, who they'll be in the future. These are usually:\n\n1. Business users: The folks looking at dashboards.\n2. Analysts: The folks diving into the data to answer novel questions.\n3. Reverse ELT: Platforms you send enriched data back to, often marketing.\n4. Data Science: Perhaps to answer questions 2 and 3 above, or to power your application.\n5. Application: Your application itself. Are you responsible for master data concepts like a single representation of a user that needs to be fed back to your platform?\n\nOnce you have a sense for these things you can then think about the technical requirements that answering those four questions and serving those five customers might entail. Often, these can be grouped into two big questions (the ones we're always asking first in this sub):\n\n1. What is the volume of the data?\n2. What are the latency requirements for my uses?\n\nFor example, making a dashboard for business users to see what happened usually doesn't require data more timely than a day. That's why so many organizations start with simple batch ELT jobs. From here, you can begin to build into the other use cases and customer needs. But, on the other hand, maybe you know that you're immediately going to be tasked with some application or data science need. Being aware of that could help you get in front of that problem and start with a more robust, lower-latency solution like streaming or microbatches from the beginning.\n\nIf, like many data teams, your first responsibility is to get the business users and analysts the data they need to understand what is happening to the business, I find [Metric Trees](https://www.datacouncil.ai/talks/designing-and-building-metric-trees) to be the most useful way to think about this. You can use this framework to anticipate the data you'll need to surface and to inform your understanding of how to organize it so that all the data relevant to a particular domain or user responsible for that data is co-located for their use.\n\nIn the end, it all comes down to your unique needs, but those various points are some of the things I consider when building out a vision for what the data team should be building, how they should build it, and when.",

I work with spark, but don't really leverage its distributed power, so there are probably other people better suited to answer the question for you, but that's just my take.\n\nAlso in general I would recommend getting your fundamental understandings of anything you do down first, rather than specializing on a specific technology especially if you're early on in your journey. If you limit yourself to one technology, you limit the positions you can potentially be hired to do. Also if you're really early on in your learning, you don't really have the perspective to know what makes a technology good or easy to use or not and your opinions on it might change once you see how you work with it in real world scenarios vs classroom/tutorial/personal project scenarios.",

Hsieh, Deborah A. Wallach, Google, 2006\n\nThere are likely more recent articles in the same vein.\n\nIf you want to develop those tools, I would probably study the active open-source tools like Apache Spark, Trino, Apache DataFusion, DuckDB and Sail to understand the general designs and the hard problems. Then study the foundations of those problems, try to solve issues and submit PRs as training, and eventually try to get a job at those organizations.",

Foundry is overkill if you're not doing heavy government/defense work or need their specific ontology features.\n\nFor the business case, hit up your Databricks rep as mentioned, they'll build you a TCO model that accounts for your specific data volumes and use cases. In my experience, Databricks wins on cost once you're processing substantial data volumes, but Snowflake can be cheaper for smaller analytical workloads. Consider your data ingestion strategy, tools like Windsor.ai can streamline data feeds to any of these warehouses, giving you flexibility to switch platforms later without rebuilding connectors.\n\nRun a pilot on a subset of your current workloads to get real performance/cost metrics. Leadership responds better to actual numbers than to theoretical comparisons. Also consider operational overhead, Databricks requires more hands on management than Snowflake, so factor in your team's capabilities when making the pitch.",

Even something lightweight like duckdb or a cloud based pgsql could work, especially if you’re layering a BI tool or dashboarding solution on top. But that does add more setup and ongoing maintenance.\n\nIf not, and you’re mainly just showing charts or summaries from selected batches, then pandas might honestly be enough. You could just scan the folder, load only what’s needed based on the user’s selection, and cache results to keep things snappy. That keeps things simple and flexible, especially if your files aren’t massive.\n\nIf I were you I would first answer these questions:\n\n- How big are the csv files, roughly? A few MBs or closer to GBs?\n\n- Are the column structures consistent across files, or do they change?\n\n- Does anyone on your team need to explore the raw data themselves, or are you the one curating all the views?\n\n- How often is new data added to the data lake?\n\n- Are there any heavy computations or aggregations you’re doing often that would benefit from SQL?\n\nAnd then, \nOnce you know the answers to those, it’ll be a lot easier to decide if you need a proper database layer or if a well organised pandas workflow can get the job done.",

Cache the converted parquet once at ingest, store minimal metadata (batchid, path, row count) in a tiny SQLite file so you can list options instantly, and use Streamlit’s st.cachedata to avoid rereading the same files. When the data volume finally outgrows laptop RAM, you can point the same parquet set at a warehouse like Snowflake without rewriting code.

Breaking it into two distinct steps allows the database to first have a copy of the data that it has statistics about, and can do it as a single bulk operation. You also have the option of creating an index on the staging table before the merge, which could help that process.\n\nBreaking it up into two steps also means that once the data is uploaded, you don't need to run your local compute process anymore, and you aren't susceptible to the process failing if you have issues with your local processing, the network connection, or the merge. It is generally just more stable, and if it has an error you have a definite point the error occurred, and since the target table merge can be a single transaction, it is easy to rollback anything critical.\n\nHaving your local data processing engine do a direct upload to a table lets it use whatever optimisations it has for the connection. If it has specific support for your database, it may make use of bulk operations in some way to speed up the process.\n\nOr, if you have a separate tool for bulk uploads, you write the data locally in a format suitable for that, push to a staging table with that tool, then merge with a database script or procedure.\n\nSQLAlchemy may be able to help with the database SQL script to integrate from the staging table to the target table.",

I hope that it allows access to `c:\\users\\My.Name\\MyProject\\MyScript.py` or `c:\\cygwin64\\home\\My.Name\\MyProject\\MyScript.py`?\n\nIn any case, even though it took years, I now *can* access Anaconda at work, so the availability of PySpark provides much needed relief from the setting up of PySpark outside of Anaconda and integrating the two.\n\n**Notes**\n\n**[1]** I also found it informative that *microcode* is at the level of abstraction of sequential state machines for digital circuits, according to Google AI.",

This would've saved you hours and can possibly save you hours in the future. \n\n\nThe answer is yes, ofcourse you can add scripts, files and networking (it narively passes your own connection, so you can download packages within the container, but you simply copy files into the container). The whole point is that you can run your entire application inside of a container without the overhead of an entire VM, but with the flexibility of everyone 'using the same os'.\n\nFor pyspark is also just skips the JAVA and SPARK environment variables because those are just already setup for you.\n\nIf you ever need to host your applications using something like docker is highly advised anyways. There shouldn't  be a barrier to installing docker.  It's one of the essential applications in any orginization where code and hosting plays any role. And (almost) completely bypasses the 'it works on my computer' syndrome.",

The merge key column is null fir these. Then I merge and update based on merge key = primary key and update the end date to close the old record and on the insert clause I insert everything from the second set.  This includes records with new keys and the latest version of records with existing keys. \n\n\n So when the merge key is matched then update and when it's null then insert.  You build the rows you want to insert and update in the selects in using clause.  Hope that makes sense.  ",

Even with these instructions and all necessary context, LLM may fail to generate response you expect for questions like this.\n\nThis may sound a bit weird, but if you have limited number of questions like this, it makes sense to prepare a report (pivot table?) that answers on the question *precisely*. If you want to encourage end users to ask their own questions - which means creation of their own new reports - first of all you need to configure a data model (cube?) that contains all necessary dimensions and measures needed to answer on these questions.\n\nTaking into account *realistic* capabilities of modern LLMs, it makes sense to offer end users 2 kinds of prompts:\n\n* \"Ask question\" in the context of the concrete data model (facts + dimensions). LLM gets in the context lists of the available dimensions, measures, filters + instructions and maybe even low-cardinality dimension values. Result is a tabular report configuration (pivot table or flat table) with filters, which can answer on user's question.\n* \"Ask question\" in the context of the concrete report data. LLM gets in the context report's table data (which is reasonably sized and not is too large for LLMs context window), possibly with supporting instructions. This is a kind of assistance with data interpretation, instead of analyzing values in table users can simply ask smth like \"what is the best client by premium\" - and get an answer if this report has calculated premium values by clients.\n\nTechnically, with tools calling these 2 steps may be combined (LLM can compose a report, then load report's data, and give an answer), however this significantly increases a risk of wrong numbers in LLM response. In BI it is very important to get *right* numbers (not just maybe-yes-maybe-no numbers), so it is better to offer simpler but more reliable LLM-based functions.\n\nThis is how we implemented LLM-based functions into our BI tool recently, based on feedback from real users.

We aren’t using any of the datawarehousing features of synapse, just the notebooks and pipelines.\n\nThe n8n implementation is already being done, so that is something I can leverage. Also, almost all tools we use are self-built, since we work with a lot of PII and medical data. All is built into our own Azure Infrastructure.\n\nI was specially not looking into one of the other big tools due to pricing and the non-complexity of our current (and 2-year future) flows.\n\nBut if you think going with one of the standard products I can look into it further!",

I’ve run a similar stack where Dagster handled the nightly MySQL dump, the Function took care of near-real-time CDC, and each step lived in a small Docker image for easy rollback. n8n can cover the happy path, but as soon as you hit backfills, parallel runs, or funky retry rules you’ll spend more time hacking state tables than moving data. FastAPI is great for the odd custom endpoint, yet wiring every job through HTTP just adds latency and headaches when something hangs. I auditioned Prefect Cloud for the UI and alerting, tested Dagster for local dev speed, and kept DreamFactory because it autogenerates the secure CRUD APIs the ETL hits without me writing auth boilerplate. Lean on Functions plus Dagster/Prefect and leave FastAPI for true service logic, not as your pipeline runner.",

Walk into any bookstore, and you'll see how to Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours alongside endless variations offering to teach C, SQL, Ruby, Algorithms, and so on in a few days or hours. \n\n> The conclusion is that either people are in a big rush to learn about programming, **or that programming is somehow fabulously easier to learn than anything else.**\n\n> Felleisen et al. give a nod to this trend in their book How to Design Programs, when they say \"Bad programming is easy. *Idiots* can learn it in 21 days, even if they are *dummies*.\"\n\n> Researchers (Bloom (1985), Bryan & Harter (1899), Hayes (1989), Simmon & Chase (1973)) have shown it takes about **ten years** to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas, including chess playing, music composition, telegraph operation, painting, piano playing, swimming, tennis, and research in neuropsychology and topology. The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And repeat again. There appear to be no real shortcuts.\n\nIt's a marathon, not a sprint. As long as you're learning, you're achieving something. Keep going.",

But more importantly, you made up a formula that increases the payout if the player spends more, and you did it in a way that would be a **big problem** if this were a real casino. With a wager of 3 credits, the house has a significant advantage (a player will lose 1.333 credits per play on average). But with the way you're calculating payouts, a player who wagers 6 credits or more has a positive expected return per play, so they can easily just bankrupt the casino by playing repeatedly.\n\nAlso, this is a much smaller issue, but your test code in `SuccessfulGameTest` seems kind of sketchy to me. For one thing, I really don't like the structure of making all your test cases being dependent on running in a specific order, because it means you can't test them separately. For another, you're not *meaningfully* testing the final balance; if you start with 10000 credits and spend 800, then checking whether the final balance is >=800 tells you nothing about whether the payouts were correct.",

Would have expected a test like \"3 apples rewards 10 credits\" and I think this functionality is missing?\n\nI am a bit puzzled by where the Reel's winCredits amount gets set. I guess it's part of the win amount calculation... but where do you set it? Maybe this is the missing code to make it work.\n\nFor tests it might be easier to test the service and API separately. But this is just a feeling as reading API tests feels more cumbersome to me.\n\nDid you try to play this? does it work?\n\nEDIT: Nvm, yea the enum sets its own value. it works.",

None of the little failure cases are tested, like \"what if we withdraw a negative amount of money?\" You have code to handle it, which is good, but code should be tested. The most important part of your gambling game is the Reel logic, and you have no tests for that.\n* Your tests are kind of unusual. Most tests I see are self-contained at the method level. They set up a situation from scratch, they exercise the system, and they examine the result. Your test methods each run one part of a larger scenario. That's not necessarily wrong. It even comes across as readable and maybe is the best way to do it, but it did give me a \"huh?\" moment, which might be bad for an interview project.\n* The main logic of your game is, to me, oddly organized. You have a \"CreditStoreService,\" which is fine, but its interface is \"takes arbitrary logic to manipulate the balance.\" Why doesn't the credit store service just have deposit, withdraw, reset, and checkBalance methods? Why put the business logic of how to modify balances in the controllers and also the game service?\n* When a game is played, you simulate the result before checking whether the player was allowed to play. This has no side effects, so it's fine, but it struck me as odd.\n\nStill, all in all, a reasonably fine project. I don't see any obvious red flags.

Companies had rooms full of manuals, and you had to look up, or photocopy, or buy your own documentation to know the api, usage etc.\n\nThen HTML arrived, actually IBM had another online format, but very similar just before html. At any rate, people who used the online documentation were more productive than those still reliant on paper, the change happened and today no one even considers having a paper copy of documentation (seldom anyway). The old guys were like \"What you can't remember that api?\". They were soon out-produced by the newer guys.\n\nNext came stack overflow, and other question / answer assists, and productivity increased for those that used it. Soon, it was required knowledge if you wanted to be competitive. Again, old mentality guys said \"You don't already know that? You have to look it up?\". Again, outdistanced soon.\n\nI'm sure you get the pattern. \n\nAI is the next documentation tool. This time the \"example\" code it provides is even closer to what you need. It's not right, often, but it's close, and sometimes it has an approach you had not even considered. \n\nThe nay-sayers will be left behind again. \n\nUse the tools, use the technology. Give yourself every advantage you can find, it's not lazy, it's not being ignorant, it's progress. In 50 years of programming, it's always been this way. You either keep up, or you become unmarketable.\n\nYou still have to learn more on your own, but boring api, or programming patterns is not where you win.

There's a reason people say to start with tic-tac-toe or a TODO app. Building something small and self-contained is great \n\n2. Piggyback off of existing projects. Clone some open-source repos down, poke around, see how much you can understand. Pick something small and cool to rebuild as much as you can, using the repo as a reference. That way you can see how code is built and used in the real world.\n\n2. Tutorials can be really useful, but don't just build what's in the tutorial. Change or add \\*something\\* so that you can apply what you've learned.\n\n3. Maybe controversial, but I strongly recommend preferring text tutorials over video. I've found that text has a number of advantages. It's more similar to reading documentation. You can easily jump around back and forth without needing to rely on timestamps or trying to skip back and forth on a video. And I'd argue that reading long tutorials helps flex the muscle of quickly filtering relevant from irrelevant content, which is important when troubleshooting and searching for relevant documentation, browsing reddit and old Stack Overflow posts (if that's even still a thing) and even when chatting with an LLM and figuring out if it's hallucinating or giving you outdated information",

        "body": "I relate, love passive learning, active learning is tough.\n\nThis sort of stuff tends to vary a lot by person, here's some tricks that work for me in no particular order:\n\n\\- Do the difficult stuff early, treat theory as the reward  \n\\- When doing stuff is painful, I often think back to [the pain is the rehab](https://boz.com/articles/pain-rehab)  \n\\- Really work on breaking down tasks into simpler subtasks. I found a lot of my spiraling was due to being overwhelmed  \n\\- Optimize feedback loops. Fastest way to kill my productivity is needing to wait 5 mins to see if a fix worked. Test-driven development is nice. Fast builds are nice  \n\\- Struggling with a problem? Write about it, pen & paper. Doodle if you want. Rant if you want. I personally find it more effective than rubber ducking  \n\\- Silent timers: you may have heard of pomodoro timing, but I didn't mesh well with being interrupted right as I was in the flow. I do something pomodoro-like but keep the timers muted, and just switch when my focus is drifting and I notice my time is up  \n\\- I found taskwarrior (CLI) meshes really well with my brain as a task tracker  \n\\- Jumpstart guides: for larger projects that have some setup, I found it takes a lot of effort to get started making changes. I wrote a four-step \"jumpstarter\" for one of my projects that carefully walks through making a trivial hello-world-style change to one of the classes, building/deploying the project, and seeing the change on a UI. Takes like 30 seconds, but somehow, doing that helps get me in the headspace to start doing actual development\n\nYou mention a lot about reading unfamiliar code: unfortunately, this is more-or-less a practice game. Some more tricks that work for me in no particular order:\n\n\\- Above all else, make sure the code can run. Trying to do any development on code that doesn't run is a death sentence  \n\\- Commit archaeology -- whole codebase is hard to read? Try git blaming some stuff you're interested in and just understanding one well-documented commit or PR  \n\\- Documenting things -- there's probably missing comments that are making things tricky, may as well make it easier for the next guy. Having docs for a function's dependencies makes it easier to read that function since you can now understand what it does without needing to ctrl+click into another context  \n\\- Debuggers are good, learn to use them  \n\\- Tests are good, learn to write them -- this is the core thesis of \"working effectively with legacy code\"  \n\\- Learn editor navigation shortcuts: be able to quickly navigate to that one class that you know the name of, to jump into and back out of specific functions, etc\n\nOverall, I'm fond to say \"productivity is an engineering problem.\" It's not the type of thing where you just find The Solution and you're good to go. Any engineering problem worth talking about has competing solutions with tradeoffs that require a process of designing, implementing, testing, and revision. Try to find specific things that are killing your productivity (the 5 Whys technique is good) and hack at it like any other complex problem.",

What works best for me is a combination of small targeted problems on different topics and using questions/answers to test my knowledge.\n\nI’ve used LLMs for this. I’ve asked them to list out the main things I need to know without going into implementation and to then come up with a series of questions that would help me practice it. I go through the questions and code up the problems it gives me without looking at a solution. I take it as far as I can. \n\nI’m not concerned with being right, I’m concerned with training my brain to think. Some of my best learning came from allowing myself to do it my way all the way, even if it turned out to be dead wrong, because that teaches me exactly why things are done the way they are. I then take my solution back to the LLM and ask it to give constructive criticism. You can also get problems from a book or a website, it doesn’t have to be an LLM, but I like the instant feedback.\n\nAdditionally, in my notes, along with having definitions for things I’m learning, I also have a questions section.  The goal isn’t to answer the question immediately, the goal is to track with honesty what I actually know vs. what I need to work on. For example, if I keep asking the same question 5 times across different problems, that’s an area I don’t truly understand.\n\nBonus: LLMs are really good at pattern recognition. Once it has enough data on you, you can ask it something like ‘Based on out previous conversations on xyz, what do I know well, what are the areas where I need to improve and what learning style has proven to work best for me?’\n\nWe learn in chunks.

It starts with being able to truly understand a problem, explore multiple ways to solve it, and compare those options—thinking through tradeoffs, constraints, and implications.\n\nBut technical ability alone isn’t enough. Great engineers can communicate complex ideas in simple terms. They adapt how they explain things depending on who they're speaking to and what the context is.\n\nI’ve been conducting interviews in Big Tech for a while now, and here's what I look for: when I present a problem, a strong candidate asks questions and engages in a real discussion about how to approach it. That back-and-forth tells me more about their ability than the actual coding exercise. In fact, in most cases, I’ve already made up my mind before they start writing code. The coding just confirms it. It’s incredibly rare that someone struggles to design or explain a solution but somehow writes brilliant code. Communication and reasoning come first.",

Hopefully there will be minimal to no permanent harm done to you.\n\nTake note that we may end up working for a toxic workplace too and it's better to learn how to protect yourself, both in your family environment, workplace, and anywhere. Learn not to overthink and stay rooted and grounded in the physical world you're in. Trust your thoughts, emotions and gut feel, don't let others tell you poor or even dangerous advises.\n\nConsider doing internships to gain real work experiences, learn to sell yourself well on your resume, LinkedIn and in interviews.\n\nThe best thing for you is learning how to protect yourself, and plan to move out of there or be away from them.\n\nand if you ever choose to get a life partner, be careful not to repeat the mistake of being with someone toxic.

From your post i understood that your in a very tough situation!  The major problem you have is 1.toxic family 2. Financial problem 3. & currently dont have a laptop! The first thing you have do is convince your parents to give your laptop back! Then you said your financial situation is very bad so you should do some part time job in any clothing store or any shop, you can try cafe or something like that! They will pay you enough to survive i think!  Considering your 20 year old female i think it Will be very tough for you to leave your home just like that!  If you can do that it will be very good but outside home in india as a lone girl finding suitable living place is very tough to get! You can live in your local hostel where College girls lives or something like that! So now you got your laptop & got a part time job & also found a shelter!  Now the journey of coding begins! As you want to learn ai / ml or like this kind of things!  But the thing is this very possible to learn but considering you situation you should first learn WEB DEVELOPMENT!  Because it is a very suitable career path to enter the tech world & you can land a job very fast as a intern or junior web developer  & you can learn 100% of it in Just 6-9 months!  So how will you learn? For that there are many resources in  YouTube & those are completely free! In my opinion you should learn from codewithharry's sigma web development course! There are also others resources like Freecodecamp etc but sigma web dev course will ne best for you bcz its in hindi!  Thats all!  If you have anymore quarry plz feel free to ask & Don't lose hope!  Have faith in yourself you will be able to overcome any problem  in your life!!",

It's to develop new circuitry in your brain for thinking about computational problems (which you do by *the process* of writing code, which code assistance can skip, so you get the right answer, but don't develop the brain circuitry).\n\nI also find that (good) books, in general, go far more in depth and provide far more insight than most other mediums for learning, which tend to be shallow and focus on low hanging fruit. Even AI is going to be mostly low-hanging fruit, as it's basically a compilation of all the blogs and reddit posts and tutorials that are out there on the internet already.\n\nIf you want something other than a book, CS50, which is basically (good) book quality in video format. Very rare.\n\nAt the end of the day, technology has changed, but our brains have remained almost unchanged the same since the advent of modern computing. You can't cheat building up those circuits in your brain to develop new ways of thinking -- you need to learn, try, make mistakes, and learn again.

Take a look at different jobs that are going in your area, what is hot, what is not, what you like, what you don't like.\n\n2. Make a note of the skills listed in the Job Descriptions (JD) for all of these jobs. You'll notice these jobs can now be categorized into job groups, based on the skills required. These grouping will be based on things like languages/frameworks/technologies etc. There will be dozens of these job groups.\n\n3. Now based on what you learned in boot camp, pick a job group for which you think you have the most skills.\n\n4. Next identify the skills you don't have for that job group and go away and learn those skills to at least a basic level.\n\nWhy do this? Because at the end that process you can confidently craft a resume that lists ever skill set required for the job group. \n\nThat then means your resume has a better chance of getting through the vetting process should you apply.\n\nIn summary, if you want to get a job in IT you'll need to make sure you have at least a basic understanding of every skill listed on the JD for the role for which you are applying.",

If you're interested in the details of my brain disability, read this GitHub issue I created seeking a workaround: \n\nhttps://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/159406 \n\n👆🏼 Basically I can only handle codebases that I am not the designer and author of if that codebase has fewer than a (relatively small) number of lines of code in it. I got around this issue as a junior developer by having a senior developer tell me, for every task I had, which file or class the code fix needed to be made in. That being said, eventually the senior developer got tired of holding my hand and spoon feeding me and then I got fired. Eventually employers caught on. \n\nBut yeah, in short, you could literally have a 4-year degree in Computer Science from MIT and then discover that you cannot work due to a very specific brain disability.

Learn the vocabulary and words that you can use when you need more details; things you use regularly will eventually stick in memory.\nAlso, making mistakes is part of the journey. Try to avoid making too big mistakes and try not to repeat them; learn from your mistakes.\n\n\nIt is very rewarding to have undisrupted time and to focus on building new features from \"scratch,\" but dealing with bugs, security issues, library/framework updates, and requirements changes are also part of the work. Try to find a balance between \"must fix\" tasks and more joyful tasks; otherwise you can easily get burnt out.",

Make mistakes, recreate things that are already created. Don't expect that it will lead to greatness but it will help you understand why (in the case of libraries) some decisions were made. Likely you will (in some cases) run into the same constraints.\n\nFor chess: why not make a chess board that lets you move a piece (and the board verifies your move is valid). that's an achievable goal. You can do it in text or using simple graphics. (graphics takes some learning but it is manageable if you set your goals low, like just load sprites for board and pieces. then displaying them in a grid. then if you cna make moves and if you make illegal moves it will stop you (just with 1 side of the pieces) you can start on taking turns with the opponent. \n\nAt any of these stages you can ask for help, talk through your planned strategy. Don't literally build what people here / elsewhere tell you is 'the optimal' way to do it. You don't need to get a perfect solution , you are exercising your brain at the coding gym. It's good to get pointed in the right direction but it's important you do the work.\n\nWe all feel like this. Especially at the start of a project because there are too many options. Once you start a project, the options become smaller and it will become easier to do steps forward. At some point you have removed enough unknowns for a specific problem that you have mental space to work on the problem at hand (isolated from the rest of the issues it becomes easier to think about). then you'll find you actually can work your way through it.\n\nThere is a reason that in school you get given clearly defined problems with clear boundaries. It makes it very easy to focus on what you have to do. Build a datastructure that ...  , build code that finds ... , etc. If you want to get a break from the high level things you can always go do some exercises but don't stick to them permanently.\n\nAnd when you see a tutorial, don't copy paste their solution but read it and then implement it yourself.",

Often that is, because one does not understand what exactly is happening on the lower levels of a thing. And if one was looking into that, then the actual project one was working on would be completely stalled.\n\nIt can help to either do a very minimalistic project, or consciously say no to something like React and build things the traditional way, just rendering a few templates in Django. And if Django is too magical, you could go more minimalistic with something like Flask, or Falcon + Jinja2 + some database connector.\n\nOr you could go even more rudimentary and choose to do some coding puzzles. Like Project Euler, Advent of Code, or similar. Those allow you also to write beautiful code to solve problems elegantly. For example last year I did AoC with solutions developed to be purely FP.\n\nOr you could do something bog standard like \"write a blog in Django\" to get more familiar with it and make it feel less like magic.",

At this point, you lose momentum, it stops being fun… and in your case, you move on to something that feels more fun again.\n\nFor personal projects (and, many a time, even professional work), better to deliver *something* that isn’t quite right than to deliver nothing at all.\n\nIf you accept that you might have to make big changes in the future (your “large front end revisions” you were avoiding), you can just pick something and see how it goes. If you like it, great… if not, you have another mini project ready for the future to redesign this to use some other design system (or whatever).\n\nAlso, yeah, you’re going to have times when working 8 hours a day on coding leaves you not wanting to touch a keyboard when you get home. Make sure you have another hobby (crochet is good) that you can switch to so you don’t burn out on coding entirely.",

I've seen posters who say \"if they're so desperate to hire programmers, why is it so hard to get a job\" (this was in the past when there was more need for programmers). The answer is a bad programmer is worse than no programmer at all. They introduce bugs. They require hand-holding. Even with experience, they sometimes never get much better. \n\nWith so many programmers out there, companies can be picky and pick those that are ready to go. There are internships for those that are part-way through their CS major degree, but even in an internship, they assume you can pick up coding, figure out an API, etc. \n\nBut it's hard to tell how much you know, so you  might be ready.

The part of the kernel that does this, is called the **scheduler**, and it is also responsible for running the different threads in a multithreaded process.\n\nThe difference between concurrency and parallelism is very important. You can have a concurrent system that never runs anything in parallel...for example an event-driven system. A concurrent system *can* be parallel, but doesn't have to be.\n\nAlso, bear in mind, that neither multithreading nor multiprocessing guarantee actual parallelism. They are a requirement for it, but it is absolutely possible to have a system that is concurrent, but not parallel, using either of those. For example, currently (as the GIL is still in place), a threading python program is multithreading, it is concurrent, but it is not parallel processing, as only one of those threads is allowed to run at any given time.",

It's more useful to know how you'd practically use concurrency.\n\nGenerally, you can either pass messages between processes, or share memory.\n\nIn the former case, you create a pipe between two different processes, and then send data from one to the other through the pipe. This is convenient, but there's a cost to it; the message itself must be copied and typically you'll have to make a system call to the operating system to do it. Still, it's great when you don't have much data to send or you need to compose different programs together and make them talk to each other (as in most command shells).\n\nIn the latter case, there's the risk that two different threads will edit the same piece of data at the same time. To prevent this, you can use atomic operations and/or mutexes. An atomic operation is guaranteed by the language to make other threads wait to mess with the variable until you've finished reading or writing to it. A mutex is a lock that only allows one thread at a time to lock it. So, you can lock the mutex, mess with the variable, then when you're done, unlock it and let another thread do whatever it wants.",

Small achievements should always be celebrated - especially when overcoming hurdles that have held you back a while.\n\n\nI'm a middle-aged hobbyist, and one of the things I've learned when pursuing other hobbies (Chinese, guitar, etc) is small steps. Good to have goals but need to crawl, walk and eventually run in that order.\n\n\nMost never get near to achieving their original goal because either their original goal was too ambitious and / or there is too large a gap between the effort and the end i.e. the amount of used guitars on sale when people realise that just learning to strum EAD chords takes approx 2 weeks of work.\n\n\nGlad to see another person presuming the time honoured text adventure (or in your case a CYOA). I too, have a number of goals that eventually included creating a MUD [multi-user dungeon]. I'm working on baby goals by first completing CS50x, then working ony simple RPG character generator.\n\n\nThe key is simple: get the basic concepts  working, then expand. Can I do points allocation for stats and include out of bounds error checking? Great! Can I get player input for name including out of bounds error checking? Better! Can I expand upon that and create a banned name list ruleset, et al?\n\n\nGoing in with lofty goals from the get-go, sees them cut down to size, and either the initial motivation disappears or one adjusts and creates smaller goals w/ a more realistic expectation.\n\n\nIf the original motivation remains intact, and one can embrace and actively enjoys learning - and has a realistic timeframe - then go for it!\n\n\nKeep your CYOA - simpe, very simple - to start. Once you have the basic structure, good method to handle and track decisions, then think about expanding. \n\n\nAll the best",

Imagine yourself in a few years being able to automate boring paperwork, analyze patient data, or even build tools that could help your colleagues and patients. You could have a real impact.\n\nOn top of that, coding teaches you new ways to think and problem solve, and those skills are useful in any field. It can make you more adaptable, more creative, and honestly, it’s just empowering to know you can build something from scratch. And who knows? Someday you might even find a niche at the intersection of medicine and tech that you really love. I say go for it!\n\nGood luck!",

        "body": "It is a difficult question to answer, because, yes, programming IS mostly about plugging things together smartly, but the thing is, that that has always been the case!\n\nWay back in the 1940s, \"programming\" was about literally plugging computing equipment together in the order needed to run the calculations you wanted. The ENIAC computer was programmed by connecting wires between components that did addition, subtraction, multiplication, comparison, storage and so on!\n\nBut of course that was very low level, and programming languages then came about, that did the job for you. You wrote \"A = B + C\" instead of plugging C and B into the addition-component, and the result into the A component.\n\nAnd as programming projects grew, you didn't write code for mathematical functions yourself, there were libraries for that, you write Math.sin(X) to calculate the sine value of X, you never write the lower level calculations yourself.\n\nWhen programmers repeat code, then instead write functions to reuse, and when those functions are needed a lot in every project, they become part of a shared library, or often the programming language itself. No one writes code to sort a list alphabetically, there's always a built in .sort function, that you don't even need to know how work.\n\nAnd when you write applications that look a lot like each other - say a web-interface to administer a database with users and their logins - you don't write the same code over and over, but do it once, and create a framework, or even easier, use a framework written by someone else! \n\n**But!** And this is the important part! - There's always something missing! The application you are working on will always need some feature that isn't in the framework, or library, or language, and then you have to write it yourself. You always have to \"dive down in between the cracks\" and write filler-code for that one thing or another. \n\nAnd also, to connect the components you still use very basic programming at the lowest level available in the language, variables, for-loops, if-statements and functions are still as important building blocks as they have ever been. \n\nSo you won't get away from needing to understand basic coding - but mostly you don't have to write very much from scratch, you almost always build on something existing!",

Sometimes you're plugging together things that you wrote, sometimes you're using something that someone else wrote. But we're always plugging things together. \n\nLet's say we're writing something that needs data from an API. Well, I'm not writing my own network layer or HTTP client, that's a waste of time -- someone else did that. So I'll write a class that handles using an HTTP client to pull down data from an API and do something useful with it. Cool. Now I have something that can be plugged into a larger system to do other things based on that data. Rinse, repeat until you have a program that's solving a unique problem (or solving an old problem in a new and hopefully better way). \n\nA core rule of our craft is \"don't reinvent the wheel\". If something already exists to do what you need to do, use it. If it doesn't, write it yourself. But generally speaking once you get past the educational phase and into the real world, you're solving unique problems within a certain domain -- medical billing, insurance, manufacturing, banking, flight scheduling, game development, whatever. You're not going to find ready-made solutions to everything within that domain, so you'll by designing and implementing solutions with the lower-level stuff as building blocks.",

That said, you still need to figure out where to place the supports, which type of nail or screw you need and where to put them, how thick the walls need to be for insulation + electricity.

Maybe HTTP is best for your project, maybe gRPC, maybe graphql — they are all prebuilt tools but still need a ton of implementation within your projects to work and all come with pros and cons. \n\nOne thing is for certain though, you can’t just tell the lumber company and the crane operator to design and build the house.

But if you have a clear goal, like mobile development, or embedded systems or web development, then I think watching crash courses that focus on that alone is a lot more beneficial if you're trying to master your field of interest.

I felt very similarly at the beginning, and my friend who has a degree in CS and works as a SWD warned me several times as I cruised through the first few lessons that it was going to rapidly scale in difficulty at some point. Mind you, he had never even heard of the site before. I think this is just one of those things that is true of programming in general, regardless of where you learn it, and being resilient and willing to do your own research goes a very long way. Nobody is going to provide you 100% of everything, and that's true even of college courses, etc.\n\nI've also found that the AI chatbot the site provides is extremely helpful not only in guiding you towards the right answers, but also explaining the underlying concepts. I'll say that with the caveat that the other day, it set me off on completely the wrong path and I spent like three hours trying to write this whole crazy method that could've just been a for loop haha",

They allow you as the developer to control the way your class is interacted with. In the field, you'll rarely be writing code on your own. Most of us work on projects with at least 10 other people touching the code that we write, and on code that other people wrote. You won't always have the benefit of knowing exactly what was going through the authors head when interacting with a class. Also... after a few months or years you won't know what was going through your own head.\n\nSo, consider a scenario where a class has a static object in it which is critical to its function. Say.. an in memory data store or cache. Nearly every public function in the class calls this object and it would be really cumbersome to check for initialization in every function call. Plus, that leaves room for error. You or another developer later on might forget to check. But you could define it with a getter that checks initialization and executes lazy initialization if its not done. Now that initialization logic exists in one place, and you never need to worry about checking for initialization when using the object. And you don't have to worry about some other developer down the line writing dangerous code into your class that forgets to check initialization.\n\nSimilar with constructors. You can use the constructor to perform logic that **must** be done before the class gets interacted with. Go grab some service dependencies, initialize some variables, warm up the cache, whatever you need.",

I request that information and cache it when the program starts, but if I call my version getter and that value is invalid for whatever reason (firmware update, mainboard resets, etc) I can spin up the serial port and request the info again, then return the new information or an error code. \n\nFrom the application perspective, I am just getting the firmware version and it doesn't really concern itself with how. I don't have to almost ever change that code, and it can be reused in other places so that if I ever change how the firmware version is retrieved, it's in one spot and makes my job much easier.

How do you figure out why it's being set to 100007?  With a setter you can put a break point (or a conditional break point) in the setter, then trace up the stack to see where and why it's being set to 100007.\n\nAs for getter, unfortunately with java if the variable is public then if it can be got it can be set.

More on that at the end.\n\nPresumably, in a real (not a learning exercise) program, many of your variables have constraints that require validation, eg can a person's age be negative or higher than 200?  Can their name contain unprintable characters or whitespace like tab?   These constraints are put into the setters, and signal an error if the attempt to set them to an invalid value is made.  Getters protect data that the user can see, but should not change.  For example, with the person, you can maybe look at their address when making a map of your customers but this is not an appropriate place and time to be changing the values -- a getter can provide a look without letting you accidentally modify it.  To modify it you must deliberately call the setter rather than just an oops side effect on a free wheeling variable. \n\nBut when the getters and setters do nothing, and they often will,  their only purpose is to keep it consistent.  These 10 values have getters and setters and those 5 do not in class A,  those 18 do not and 11 do in class B, .. C, D, E, ... after a few classes, remembering which variables in which classes have getters and setters is overwhelming.  If you just assume they all have these functions and use them for everything, its that much less burden on the programmer.   They also abstract validation: when using them ALL of your validation looks the same:\n\n    while( !class.setter_for_variable(new_value) )\n    { \n        display bad input message()\n       new_value =   get new input from user ()\n    }",

That would isolate your use of scanner to that method alone, and make the rest of the code easier to write without having to handle exceptions or different invalid inputs.\n\nIt is always a good idea to have a lot of small methods that only do one thing - my own personal rule is that if I have more than two levels of if-statements or loops, I need to make a method to combine them.

I also don't get why this is courageous and hard. That gives vibes like you're only doing this because you don't know what to do and don't want to work.\n\n\n\nWhat stopped you from learning until now? Everyone says the same thing about how passionate they are; but if you ever had a computer or even a graphing calculator then you could have learned. This seems like the only thing people ever say they're passionate about before they have even tried it. And they always say it after talking about games.\n\n\n\nAgain, this is really the default thing to say. Someone wants to make games. They're \"passionate\". Never tried. They don't know what to do about their career. You could pick almost any 18-25-year-old boy and they'll say the same thing.\n\n\nThe point isn't really to discourage you but instead to encourage you not to limit yourself to the only thing that feels safe: games and internet.

This could easily be handled by a single kernel thread when it comes to CPU load, so it makes perfect sense to create virtualized threads, which expose the same API as a kernel thread, but all run on a single kernel thread.\n\nWhen faced with CPU-bound work, however, user space threads are simply not that useful. No matter how you slice your algorithm, you only have a fixed number of threads capable of independent computation, so even if you run 10 thousand virtual threads per kernel thread, all of them together can execute only as much real computation (not waiting) as the kernel thread itself. Of course, since managing user space threads has some overhead, this is also a net negative in performance for CPU-bound work.\n\nModern server applications are rarely CPU bound, though, so feel free to go as far as you want with your millions of user space threads, like Go has shown to be completely possible and manageable.",

        "body": "This is actually dependent on whether the OS scheduler can reliably have threads run on different physical cores. With some server products, it absolutely can. If your program executes on a single core, there's no benefit. Multithreading (and lightweight async execution) lets a program benefit from context switching where a blocked thread can surrender the cpu until its data arrives. The OS scheduler will do this with processes as well. As long as the thread can still do work on the cpu, there's no point in switching off. Also, do note that cpu cores are pretty good at parallelizing independent work and simulating in order execution. We've had cpus with multiple ALUs per core for example since the 90s and the hardware will dispatch parallel instructions as long as there's no dependency within the execution window. You as a programmer don't have to specifically ask for this. The same is true for things like hard disk caching.\n\nOn the multiple cpu issue, it is worth testing or reading more about if you need this. There have been notorious cases like Playstation where hardware designers shipped multi-core hardware only to find that the OS hardly ever used more than one and never more than two. On the flip side, there are cases like Sql Server on Windows, where the server absolutely can scale across cores to process large volumes of data. I know that's an IO bound load, but often the whole load is aggressively cached when the request comes in so there's low latency.",

        "body": "It can be, if the executor of the user-space threads is itself multi-threaded and runs on multiple system threads.\n\nUser-space threads are designed to solve a very specific issue - to reduce the time a system thread needs to wait on operations that block (think: locking a mutex, waiting for IO, waiting for timer,...). It is implemented thusly:\n\nInstead of calling blocking APIs, we call their non-blocking alternatives . The non-blocking version of the API works the same, but instead of blocking, it returns \"would block\" error.\n\nA user-space thread is a state machine. The states are the values of thread-local variables at the points where blocking operation is called. Advancing a state means executing all the code up to the operation that would block.\n\nThis advancing of states is done by an executor, which runs directly on a system thread. The executor has a set of user-space threads. It advances a user-space thread up until the point it calls a \"blocking\" that would block. It then tries to find another user-space thread in the set, which no longer blocks and can be advanced. If all the user-space threads in the set are blocked, the executor (ie. the system thread its running on) blocks, until one of the user-space threads unblocks (operating-systems do have API that lets you wait on multiple blocking operations simultaneously, until one of them unblocks).\n\nAs you can see from this, user-space threads are completely useless for CPU-bound tasks (ie. tasks that don't wait on blocking operations). You might as well just directly run such tasks as a sequence, because that's exactly what a user-space thread executor will end up doing (likely with some additional overhead).\n\nHOWEVER! A user-space thread executor can be parallelized using system threads. You spawn multiple system threads (as many as your computer has cores) aka. a thread pool. Each system threads runs an executor, but they all share the same set of pending tasks. Now the tasks (in our case, user-space threads) can actually truly run in parallel.\n\nThat being said, user-space threads, as tasks for thread pools, is not the best abstraction for CPU-bound tasks. If you don't divide the work evenly between the user-space threads, then some of the system threads in the thread pool will be busy with big long tasks, while the rest are parked, waiting for something to do.\n\nA better abstraction are tasks that can be automatically broken down into sub-tasks that can be done in parallel. That way, the thread pool can automatically spread the load among the system threads. For example \"apply this operation to each item in a list\" can be easily split into processing sub-ranges of the list, or even individual items.\n\nThis is why pure functional paradigm has gained some notable traction in the last decade. It is trivially parallelizable, because the program is ultimately a tree of function calls where branches (ie. evaluation of arguments) can be evaluated independently of one another.\n\nImperative code, much less so, because it essentially describes a sequence of operations that are expected to be executed in order. Transforming that sequence into multiple independent parallel sequences (ie. threads) is not trivial.",

Usually one process:one app but when you can and want to utilise multiple CPU cores you need more processes. That usually gets called multi threading but that's not what your operating system, or my concurrent computing textbook calls it.\n\nIn my experience outside uni, both these things tend to get called threads without much care for the very important distinctions. Like I'm seeing people talk about user vs kernel threads and it kinda sounds like when they say kernel thread they mean what I've called a process above. However windows and Linux both provide a kernel feature that matches my definition of a thread above. Not having a go at anyone we're all just using words the way we were taught to.

It gets even harder when it’s time to build your own project from scratch - no hand-holding at all.\n\nThe main issue with the platform is that sometimes they expect your code to look almost exactly like their solution. Maybe they allow a few minor differences, but not much.\n\nJust remember: programming is like riding a bicycle - the more you do it, the better you get. Be consistent, and eventually it’ll click.\n\nOne thing I’d also recommend: when you reach the data structures and algorithms section, start practicing those concepts directly on LeetCode.

I will however give you a great starting reference guide though - \n\n[https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)\n\nThis is a site that not only has documentation for just about anything you can do with HTML/CSS/Javascript(these three were as deep as we got) but also includes built in environments to start messing around and see what happens when you change different values. \n\nOne thing I do recommend though - learn HTML at least reasonably well before you move onto CSS. CSS is an *amazing* tool that basically acts as templates. It makes a lot of things much easier to do but it's important to know *how* they work under the hood if you want to really get your skills up. Trust me, HTML is not hard and you can get up to speed relatively quickly. Our course was like once a week for 12 weeks and by the end we could make functional websites with decent designs.\n\nOne amusing thing about HTML compared to other languages - it does not care how bad your coding is. It will try to run it anyway. You can have a garbled mess of garbage that god himself will not forgive under the hood and as long as the important parts are functional it'll still go, as opposed to other programming languages that tell you to die in a fire if you miss one bracket. Just something to keep in mind - your code may work despite being terrible(professor asked me \"what the hell is all this doing?\" one time when I had a solid 30 lines of broken code) so use some attention to detail to keep it clean.\n\nHope that helps a bit, best wishes!",

Also, it really does come down to surfing the web, especially Github.  Read the issues lists of repos you're interested in.  But reproducible bugs suitable for beginners are rare in my experience.",

In that case you can **hope** that it is just some kind of standard hash function applied to the data, maybe after some simple transformation.. n this case you have some hope of guessing the hashing algorithm by trial and error.\n2. The hash is intended specifically to prevent people from doing what you're doing: generating CNC files with \"unauthorized\" software. In that case the designers will have used something like an [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) (if they're competent) and you will have no hope of reproducing it without reverse-engineering whatever existing software generated the hash.\n\nIn the second case, reverse-engineering the system is almost always possible *in theory*, but *in practice* it might be very very difficult.",

Soft skills are all about interaction with people and are very useful in the work place. They will help open a lot of doors regardless of industry. People in IT regardless of field have a very bad image with most people because a lot of us lack basics like conversation skills or team building. The old joke of a coder locked in a closet because no one wants to deal with him is what a lot of non technical people think of IT related jobs.\n\nLeadership skills are also very useful regardless of if you want to get into management or not down the line. Every project or team needs someone to lead it, why not you? It also helps with dealing with different levels of management. Something I learned a while ago is leaders don’t just lead those they are responsible for, they also lead their managers on up as well. Of the two this one has been very useful since I started developing it. \n\nAs for how to learn them; soft skills are mostly about interaction with people on a regular basis. Help desk jobs are great for learning them but going to classes about anything you are interested in person is a great start. Just get a conversation started and keep it going. One big skill to learn is active listening. As for leadership I can recommend a couple of books to get you started if you are interested.",

It's really nice to see someone trying to clarify something about the interaction of the language with the environment it's running in.\n\n`scanf()` is not moving the cursor.  The OS is.  Well, the terminal application is, with the help of the OS (and possibly BIOS).  It turns out that the cursor advances all the time.  Like when you type in the command to compile:\n\n```\n$ _\n$ g_\n$ gc_\n$ gcc_\n```\n\nAfter each character typed, the cursor advances (most of the time).  But terminals are very complex things.  Suffice to say that the terminal--with the help of the OS--manages receiving keystrokes and \"sending them\" to the application.\n\nIOW, the terminal receives the keystrokes.  It does what it usually does; advances it when you type a character, retreats it when you type backspace, etc.  Then, after it does what it needs to (though there are exceptions, like what happens when you press `Ctrl-C` on a Unix-like machine), it tells your C program: \"Hey, someone pressed a character, here it is.\"  Then, you do whatever you're going to do with it.\n\nIt's somewhere from \"a little\" to \"way more\" complicated than that in realities, but that's the general idea.  Just to finish this up, the complexity can come around buffering, which is how many character the terminal and OS will hold before sending them.  If it sent every character, one at a time, that could be inefficient, so sometimes terminals and OSes buffer.  Generally, in terminal applications, hitting `<enter>` will force/suggest the underlying bits (terminal, OS) to send the data to the application.  Also, it's the terminal that decides to move the cursor down (newline), and then return to the left-side on English/Western locales (carriage return).\n\nIf you're curious about how terminals work on Unix-like machines, check out **Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment** by Stevens, often abbreviated \"APUE\".",

        "body": "In a traditional environment with a serial terminal connected to a remote computer, keyboard input to the terminal is sent to the remote computer to be handled as program input, and output from a program is sent from the remote computer to the terminal for display.\n\nMost of the time, the cursor is placed after the last output character sent from the remote computer.  Sometimes other characters change the cursor position, like a carriage return moving the cursor to the beginning of the current output line, a line feed moving the cursor down one line, a backspace moving the cursor backward one character, and other special escape sequences can move the cursor in other ways (such as to a specified row and column).\n\nAlso in most cases the operating system terminal driver echoes characters input on the terminal back out to the terminal.  This may happen automatically in the terminal driver without the remote program having to do anything, but the terminal driver can also be put in a mode where automatic echo is disabled and the program must deliberately echo input characters if it wants to.  A text editor, for example, may set non-echoing mode so that editor commands are not echoed when they are typed, and instead output from the editor program displays the results of performing the command.\n\nThe terminal driver in the operating system usually also handles input in line mode, meaning that an entire line of characters followed by a ENTER is buffered up and made available to the program after ENTER is pressed.  But the terminal driver can also be put into a mode where every keypress from the terminal is immediately available to the program, rather than being held and sent when ENTER is pressed.\n\nIn modern computers the terminal is often a program that emulates the behavior of a serial terminal, because the serial terminal model is so pervasive for managing program input and output.\n\nIn a simple program, output to the terminal is what moves the cursor, so calling scanf() does not cause the cursor to move, and if the terminal driver is in its normal mode of echoing input, it's the echoed output of input characters, or output from the program, that moves the cursor on the terminal",

But I learned to program long ago and I'm in the minority on that.\n\nFor front-end, you are ultimately always working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. There are a ton of pre-processors that can compile, obfuscate, and otherwise turn code from some other source format into JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. For my part I just use those basics straight, usually with jQuery. But I've also used JavaScript compilers like esbuild (which I like because it's very fast).\n\nSo I think it's largely a matter of taste and people tend to mostly use what they already know.\n\nI think the main constraints are (1) if you're writing server code that needs to be very fast, you either need to master something like numpy or the equivalent JavaScript libraries, or use C++ or rust. In my opinion, it's easier to use a fast language like C++ instead of trying to cleverly use numpy or other C++-based libraries to make a slow language like Python faster.

If you start from python its hard to understand heap VS stack memory, memory leaks, pointers, parsing binary data into structs and other concepts. Its also the common intermediate language between many languages - many languages have integration with C, and then integration between the languages is done through C.\n\nYou may not use these \"low level concepts\" most days (depending on your job), but when you will need them (optimizations, weird bugs, integration with weird external projects) you will understand them better. You will also learn to appreciate higher level languages, and understand some of the \"whys\" in their design.\n\nThen, in parallel, python is just a great scripting language for quickly getting something done, can teach you how higher level languages work, and many big projects use it.\n\nAfter knowing enough of those two, i would suggest trying to understand what you like and want to learn/work at, and either pick another language popular in that domain or stick with C/Python.",

From the little brochure web site for an electrician to, I dunno, TurboTax and other vast and complex stuff.\n\nSome of it is desktop software. Autocad, for example, is a really big and elaborate piece of desktop software constructed over many years by many master, journeyman, and apprentice tradespeople. We call them lead, senior, and junior developers. \n\nSome of it is mobile software. The reddit mobile app is an example.\n\nWe have \"boot camps\" to help people get started. https://freecodecamp.org/ is a good self-paced boot camp. There are many others.\n\nThe boys at Harvard offer their CS50 (computer science 50) class online for free, and you'll get a lot of really useful theory there. But keep in mind they are computer scientists. Think \"professors of mechanical engineering\". And most of us programmers use that theory to make useful stuff rather than to solve programming puzzles.\n\nThere's a related trade called IT (information technology). This one involves setting up and maintaining computers and networks and servers and all that stuff. It's not quite the same as programming, but just as helpful to end-users. If you have electrician chops, this could be a straightforward transition for you, because good wiring correctly installed is a critical success factor. It's possible you could do this under the IBEW umbrella (I think, I don't know from union stuff). \n\nWelcome to our trade. Like anything, you gotta practice.

The language used for the coding aspect depends on the school (mine chose Python), but they do not teach much either, only the basics really. This is very evident now that we are starting our NEAs, because almost everyone in my class is panicking.\n\nI do the bulk of my learning independently because of this, so I can confidently say that if you put your mind to it, you will be able to learn any language you want, or do any personal project you want. Everything is well documented with a virtually infinite amount of resources. \n\nI recommend W3schools for an introduction to any of the well known languages, and CS50x for a general introduction to computer science. They also have offshoots like CS50p specifically for Python.\n\nGood luck with your studies! :)",

Don't stress too much about keeping up with every framework change. Focus on understanding the fundamentals really well.\n\nAt Metana, we see a lot of bootcamp grads who started exactly where you are. The ones who succeed aren't necessarily the ones with perfect code, they're the ones who can learn fast and solve problems.\n\nYou're probably more ready than you think. Start applying to junior roles while continuing to build projects. The worst they can say is no, and you'll learn what gaps you still need to fill.\n\nGood luck :)",

Good luck.” What they should say is, “Here’s why you’d use X in situation A, why not in situation B, and what the tradeoffs are.”\n\nThink about how your best teachers helped you learn a difficult concept. They didn’t just throw facts at you, they used metaphors that hooked into emotionally salient narratives you already understood. They met you where you were. Docs almost never do that. They assume tabula rasa logic and ignore the emotional friction of learning.\n\nFor me personally, I can’t remember something if I learn it in isolation, like just reading the docs. I need to actually understand why I should use X or Y by thinking through what problems this solves. So instead of trying to memorize pandas functions, I focus on understanding what problem each one addresses. When I encounter groupby(), I don’t just memorize the syntax, I understand it’s for when I need to split data into groups and perform operations on each group separately.\n\nPeople think the software industry is smart because it’s lucrative, but honestly, most frameworks are born in corporate hellscapes, not classrooms. There’s almost zero thought given to long-term cognitive overhead, onboarding cost, or whether the tradeoffs even make sense outside the dev team that built it.\n\nWe don’t need more features, we need more epistemology. Teach people how to think through code, not just parrot API calls.\n\nDelete out of your mind “move fast; break things” a more mature ideology is “move slow; ask why”.\n\nAnd most importantly never give up! It’s okay to not know everything.",

If you have 20 years of experience, but most of it is in things that aren't used anymore, employers will start saying \"Why should we hire you when we can hire a new grad instead?\"  Even if you say \"I'm willing to work for new grad wages to get better experience.\", they'll assume that something is wrong with you just for offering that, and you'll jump the second you can get something better.\n\nSuppose you already have experience in X and new thing Y comes out.  There's a short period of time where you can get hired to do Y without previous experience in Y.  After that, they're only going to hire people who already know Y.  Further, it's easier for you to get X jobs than Y jobs, because you already know X well.\n\nYou also can pivot to Y and choose wrong.  I had one job where everyone was excited to be learning Angular 1.0.\n\nOutside of big tech, where you need to be able to solve leetcode hards, they tend to hire based on N years of experience in X language.

AWS, iPhone, Facebook, YouTube among others were all launched in that time period. There was massive growth every year as more people got cell phones, wanted apps and social networking and companies moved compute to the cloud. Fast forward to 2025, everyone who wants a mobile app has one, everyone who wants on the cloud is already there. What’s the iPhone moment now? LLMs? One of the reasons they are being pushed so much is that this is probably the only hypergrowth market around right now. While there will always be a need for engineers unless there is a heretofore unknown radical increase in demand, one that AI/offshoring can’t meet, the past 20 years of growth are gone. It’s a mature industry now.",

When that actually happens, the janitor is not usually the one who's actually put in charge of the global rollout of his good idea (nor is it his janitorial team/department), and at best the janitor gets a small bonus or maybe a one level promotion -- it's not as if the janitor suddenly becomes a VP off of one good idea.",

As your manager or mentor, I would want to work with you on that preoccupation because it can be career-limiting. Your focus should be on adding value rather than making sure you are getting “credit” for every thing you do. HR would tell you that is what your compensation is for and you can document on your self-assessment for your performance review. I would never utter the word “credit” again as this all transpires.\n\nHaving said that, this is a wonderful opportunity and quite flattering for anyone, never mind someone early in his career. \n\nI would suggest writing a lengthy email about your concerns. You can start it with, “As the architect of this process ….. it has come to my attention… and in order to ensure maximum success…. I want to make everyone is aware xxxxxxx” List the important stuff, like why you think this won’t scale and why each instance needs to be customized. But offer fixes to the problems as well. How can this be customized so that it does work for other departments? What work effort would be required? Be specific and as lengthy as you need to be, as you will be saving them time and possible embarrassment. Also, if it doesn’t scale, you could end up being blamed, (“who created this in the first place”)\n\nSend your email to all interested parties and cc: your boss. Again, make sure the email is emotionless, fact-based and solely focused on you trying to help the company and the team to succeed. Of course, this also serves as your documentation that you are the originator.\n\nTry not to assume the worst in people. You created something so good that an upper level manager thought it was good enough to scale to other departments. The higher up managers are, the less they know about what is happening on the ground, so don’t take it personally.",

Most of development planning I do, is figuring out what is that minimal set of things we need in order for the app or whatever to be successful.\n\nThe difficult thing about software, and what will take years to learn, is to understand the tradeoff space between doing something fast that quickly solves a problem but might have a lot of tech debt, and taking more time to do something right, and having less tech debt or ongoing costs.

I’ve been in contact with folks at my company since they first started layoffs in 2023. I personally know a couple of people who this summer are moving back in with their parents because they can’t land a job. That’s with my FAANG company in the resume. No it’s not Amazon or Meta. I know some with families who were forced to pack up and move across the country. I know some who got laid off after moving. I know some who can’t move their families so they have to fly across states every weekend just to be with them on the weekends. I know some who went from making 300k+ to around 150k - 80k. \n\nI don’t want to cause any alarm. But there are my personal anecdotes. I always try to keep in touch with coworkers, it’s just something I do. Yes, there are some who managed to land jobs at other high paying companies. But I’ve noticed that these people are either really smart or went to top colleges (Stanford, Cornell, MIT, etc). I went to a shitty state school and for the most part I’m severely average. Do I really want to be constantly grinding for the rest of my life? I’ve been interviewing candidates for the last 2 years. The level of talent is insane. These kids who only graduated like 3-4 years after me are such sweats, they can solve these leetcode hards like it’s nothing. I can’t even pick an easy or medium question for them anymore.\n\nSorry for the rant.",

Generally speaking, if you are just building user-facing features, Android has a lower ceiling as most of the hard problems should be taken care of by the backend. You aren't going to build something out of a system design interview in your day to day.\n\nBut here are some examples where you CAN differentiate yourself:\n\n1) Building frameworks / features in a way that's easy to iterate on. What if your app wants to show every new UI screen with a certain template that serves a nice entrance and exit animation? Okay, now you have to build that animation out. But it would be inefficient for every engineer who wants to add a new screen to deal with that themselves, so you build it in a way with enough abstractions / modularity that it's easy to use for other use cases.\n\n2) Finding and solving problems that nobody knows exist, because they're not directly attributable to the product. Maybe your app startup time is too long, or you lose a lot of users while a certain page loads. You have the ability to improve this stuff and see incremental but significant gains in engagement.\n\n3) Influencing the backend / APIs - the backend doesn't always know exactly what's needed and what's possible from a mobile perspective, or edge cases that might arise. Being good at your job means you participate in these discussions, not just showing up to plug in their fully baked implementation to the mobile app\n\nI'd also add this: judging the value of an engineer solely in the context of \"What technically difficult problems can they build\" as if you need to be building something worthy of a case study in an algorithms textbook is a very junior way of thinking.",

Companies have been known to backchannel and torpedo candidates who have gone on public record bashing them. Especially in the tech world, it's not unheard of for one C-Suite to reach out to another to \"warn\" them about a problem candidate. A close friend of mine was let go after her first 2 weeks at a new company after the CEO of the company we both worked at got wind that she was trash-talking her experience on Facebook. He reached out to another exec at her new company, pointed out her posts, and said it would be risky to keep her on. \n\nAnother is that some companies love to sue. This is especially true when people sign a non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement. If a former employee starts talking shit and the company catches wind, you could lose out on your severance, they could come after you in court, or just make you suffer through a legal fight you likely can't afford. \n\nAs much as I would love to expose the garbage companies I've worked for, it's not without it's risks and frankly, many folks aren't in a position to defend themselves.",

Are you getting past the resume screening at least? Are you getting recruiter phone calls and moving to the technical interviews? \n2. Are you open to interviewing outside of Vancouver, maybe even in the US? \n3. Curious how you’re fitting all of that experience on a resume.

Mostly to pivot and be eligible for new grad/student recruiting pipelines again. \n\nYour best bet is to continue doing internships and get a return offer.

The good news is that your background is genuinely impressive and you're not starting from zero like most new grads.\n\nStop delaying graduation - you're essentially in limbo right now and employers can sense that uncertainty. Graduate in August and commit fully to the job search, but expand your geographic scope beyond Vancouver. Toronto, the US, or even remote opportunities could open doors that Vancouver simply can't right now. The trades and military options aren't bad backup plans, but don't abandon tech when you're this close to breaking through. Get your resume professionally reviewed, practice your interview skills extensively, and consider contract or startup roles that might be more willing to take a chance on someone with your background.\n\nI'm on the team that made [interview AI](http://interviews.chat), and I've seen how much difference it makes when people can practice handling tough interview questions and get real-time feedback on their responses - it might help you convert those eventual interviews into offers.",

Lean into the benefits of being in a city not flooded by big tech layoffs. If you make a good enough impression you can get your foot in the door before the company even posts the job.

I went from failing these interviews at senior level to getting rated staff level for them. \n\nBasically you have 45-60 mins, not a ton of time anyways. Ask clarifying questions, write out functional requirements, non-functional requirements, define core entities, define the api, do a high level design that satisfies the functional requirements via the api (like actually check them off like a todo list), then deep dive to cover your non functional requirements (check them off). That should take most of your time, might have a few questions from your interviewer boom you’re done. ",

As you can imagine this was a vicious cycle that never really got any better until I left.\n\nFortunately the beauty of remote work is that you can generally find a workplace that will accommodate you, especially if you don't live on the west coast and can take advantage of the time zone difference.\n\nedit: It's unfortunately very normal for some workplaces to be like that. My experiences with early morning people in management positions is that they tend to be pretty unreasonable and may go out of their way to sabotage you if you don't want to work on their schedule.",

The first company literally created an impossible promotion requirement (you need to break production to get promoted, seriously?) and the second one wouldn't give you the senior title despite you interviewing at that level. You were doing senior-level work for years, mentoring people, doing system design and architecture - that's what matters, not some arbitrary title that got screwed up by bad management and weird rubrics.\n\nThe job market is brutal right now and you're getting filtered out because of title inflation, not because you lack the skills. If you were the longest-tenured engineer doing senior work but got stuck with \"Engineer I\" because of a broken system, then putting \"Senior Backend Engineer\" reflects what you actually did, not what some dysfunctional HR system labeled you. Just be prepared to explain the work you did in interviews - your experience speaks for itself. I'm on the team that made [AI interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) and we built it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to confidently explain your experience and handle questions about your background.",

Its not the shiniest anymore but companies actually use it in production. Next.js is also huge right now if you wanna go that route.\n\nThe thing is, at this point its less about picking the \"perfect\" stack and more about getting really good at one thing. Companies would rather hire someone who's solid at React than someone who kinda knows React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte.\n\nWe see this at Metana all the time. Students who try to learn everything end up not being great at anything. The ones who pick a stack and build 2 to 3 real projects with it are the ones getting hired.\n\nBuild stuff that actually does something useful. Not another todo app lol.

For now, it's probably best to address your immediate needs, and you don't have to do it alone. Pass your resume along to your friends, search for employment services like temp agencies near you, and try to talk with career centees and career fairs to make sure you don't miss out on chances to get critical feedback on your resume. See if you can hone one resume to show technical employers, and another one to use for part-time work. Beyond that, i can't provide too much advice and you've probably heard a lot of it before. Get something, anything, under your feet to keep you going, and the rest falls into place with time and persistence. It does get better.",

I'll do this for the time being until I can land a much better-paying job that's at least IT-related or adjacent.\n\nAt this point, it's just outright borderline impossible to even get your foot in the tech work field door right now because there's just no way to get the necessary experience without time-traveling back to the past when entry-level jobs still existed or without compromising a lot of money(certain certifications, unpaid personal projects, volunteer, etc.). \n\nIt's also gotten rather tiresome for me to see quite a lot of out-of-touch folks in so many CS subreddits making the boomer assumptions that all of the latest CS grads who are unemployed are just too unqualified and incompetent for any job in tech and that they supposedly didn't try to get internships during college. They conveniently ignore that even CS internships have gotten a lot more incredibly competitive, selective, and oversaturated now than ever because they're aren't negatively affected by today's poor job market, especially in tech.\n\nOn the bright side with my temp agency work, despite not paying a liveable enough salary, at least the job itself was pretty laid-back in my experience when I briefly did it during my short time off from college before graduating.\n\nSorry for this TL;DR-length comment.

I made it to the late stages with five different companies, all past the technical round. But was rejected from three. I was able to end the prices with one when I got the offer at my current job \n\nWhat follows is my anecdotal experience. Companies are extremely picky right now. I would feel really strong about my interview performance. I would connect with the hiring managers and the CEO or CTO. I would feel great about my technical round performance. Then I wouldn't get the role. The reasons given, because I would always ask for feedback, were typically that I performed well, but someone was a better fit. Which makes sense. There were probably five hundred or more applicants. But a few of those I would see the same job posted a week or two later, those were frustrating. \n\nMy advice is to keep a pipeline going. You want a few of those initial recruiter interviews a week so that you have a couple of technical and later stage interviews going at all times. The process seems slower than it used to, like a month or longer from application to offer. \n\nAnd give yourself grace. This is really difficult and you are going to get down on yourself. My wife described it like buying a house, you get really attached to an idea of a place where you start imagining yourself only to be out bid. But only one has to work out. \n\nSorry if that was super long. I hope your job hunt goes well.",

No idea how they’ll go yet but this is the most responses ive ever had. To be clear I definitely don’t have a normal resume and to most standard metrics my resume makes no sense at all so all my interviews are for startups, big tech won’t touch me with a ten foot pole. Not super useful data for standard mid level dev, but there’s definitely stuff you can do to improve your chances if you’re willing to take some risks.",

That time I’m there was very little emotion. The next team I worked on, I spent 6 years going from a mid-level to and lead. Over 4 years I got to build out an awesome team. Not just developers, but a few BAs, a PM, and a QA team. This was for two huge projects. Nothing makes people close like time in the trenches. We all became great friends. After the second project launched, I needed a change of scenery and a great remote opportunity opened up that would allow me to move home. Resigning from that team was the hardest decision I ever made. Some of those developers couldn’t hardly write OOP code when they started with me and by the time I left, we were a well oiled machine.  Not a day goes buy 2 years later that I don’t think about them.\n\nThe last two years I had the chance to build a software dev practice from near scratch. It has been a great experience, and some of the folks I’m really going to miss when I leave in about two weeks. This time I knew it was the right decision to leave (bad culture fit, lost a big contract for reasons the dev team had no control over, inconsistent / lack of full time adjacent support, and never ending dangling of carrots that always vanished when they were to materialize). Am I going to miss my team? For sure. Some have become friends like my last team. But the reality is that for them to grow as well, I need to move on. They rely way too much on me and I failed to get them to fly on their own because of pressure from the top to deliver now now now. \n\n My new role is a director of software engineering, so it’s going to be a new experience for me… but I will always appreciate the folks I work with daily. I don’t think leaving good people is ever easy. It’s great when you can challenge each other just the right way, attack problems with some out of the box solutions, and just being nerds together in general. \n\nAt the end of the day though, you have to worry about your and your career progression. You don’t want to be the guy/gal that sits for 10 years on a project and never gets to grow or even totally stagnates. It’s human to care, but at the same time be happy for what you all accomplished together and leave on a high note.",

Full stack experience at a small company where you're leading features? That's valuable real-world experience that beats a lot of what new grads get at big companies where they might spend 6 months just learning internal tools.\n\nFor getting into big tech eventually, it really does come down to two main things: 1) having solid fundamentals, and 2) being able to communicate your experience well in interviews. Your portfolio projects + the feature leadership experience you mentioned gives you good stories to tell.\n\nDon't bother with a masters unless you want to go into research or very specialized areas. The time you'd spend in school could be better used gaining more experience and prepping for interviews.\n\nPractical next steps: Start doing leetcode regularly (like 15-30 min daily), practice explaining your projects clearly, and start applying to mid-size companies as stepping stones. Companies like Shopify, Slack, Stripe etc often have good engineering cultures and pay well but aren't as competitive as the absolute top tier.\n\nFor the behavioral side of interviews - this is where a lot of engineers struggle. You need to get good at telling stories about your work using frameworks like STAR. That's actually why I built Score My Interview, because so many talented engineers miss out on opportunities just because they can't evaluate and communicate their impact clearly.\n\nThe comparison thing is tough but remember - social media shows highlight reels, not reality.

The old guys I know in this business, do not give a shit were you used to work. They barely care where they worked. And no one outside this business cares who you work for. \n\nNow, how do you advance your career. Try to stick it out for two years in your job (but it's okay to bail if a better opportunity comes along...becoming the CTO of your buddy's start up is not a better opportunity), then move on to the job, work another couple of years, three if you like it. Then move on. Every time you change jobs, you will get more money. More importantly, you will increase your breadth of experience. You'll be exposed to more approaches to development. Which will make you better able to advocate for one approach over another. It will also help you understand what really matters vs. what's just noise.\n\nEventually, you'll want to start increasing your time in jobs just to show you're not a job hopper. However, you wil reach a point where it really doesn't matter. My default advice is keep your linkedIn profile up to date, turn on the quiet open to work flag, and respond to every recruiter that isn't a clear scam, even if it's to say, \"thanks, but this isn't the right opportunity for me\". My average is about three years.\n\nYou do this for a while, and big tech companies will start to notice you. They may not be FAANG, but the pay is good.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that your career is a business.

Full stack experience at a small company where you're leading feature initiatives? That's gold. Big tech companies love seeing that kind of ownership and impact, even if it's not at a \"prestigious\" place.\n\nI dropped out of med school and took a pretty unconventional path myself. Started multiple companies, had some wins and losses, and eventually built Metana to help people exactly in your situation. The thing is, there's no one \"right\" path and those social media posts are just highlight reels.\n\nAnd The masters thing? Honestly depends on what you want. If you're eyeing specific roles that require it, sure. But experience and strong interviewing skills usually trumps another degree.\n\nOn the comparison side, remember that for every person posting about their Meta offer, there are thousands of successful devs who took different paths. The goal isn't to be the loudest person on social media, it's to build something meaningful.\n\nYou're already ahead of most people just by being self aware about where you want to go. Keep grinding, the market is actually getting better for devs right now :)",

It felt good but I didn’t actually learn anything, and there was too much fighting over cool projects to actually grow demonstrably. \n\n\nWhen I would have my 1:1s with more senior folks I always asked “what career advice do you have” and a lot of them would joke “work at big tech out of college” which I was fortunate enough to do, but also highlighted that most people with those jobs weren’t in that position. \n\n\nPost uni if you aren’t given a golden ticket from graduating (Ivy+, FAANG internships, etc.) you’ll actually have to prove yourself. This means working in jobs where you have impact and actually do stuff. While it will probably be harder than resting and vesting, it will push you to have the work ethic required to be truly successful in this field. \n\n\nFAANG folks get paid a lot more, but aren’t really noticeably smarter from what I’ve seen. Plus after spending 3 years supporting the migration of a survey modal at big tech you might realize you weren’t really doing as much as you would have expected. \n\n\nClout only gets you so far (and to be honest it does get you pretty far) but at a certain point people are going to ask what you actually do, and those who were in the trenches at their small shitty company are going to have a lot more to say than the person on the platform team with 3 PMs and a different director every month.",

Having regular production incidents implies you have a fragile product. That's a problem. It's not sustainable.\n\nThat's one of the main things I focus on during the reverse-interview process. I really dig deep into on call rotations, how frequent calls are, when the last incident was, what the response was during that last incident, etc.\n\nUnless I'm unemployed and desperate, I will not join a company that says they get after hours calls more than a few times ***a year***. Let alone per week. The type of company you join is very much in your control.\n\nThere is a bit of a differentiation between after-hours calls and business-hours calls though. During business hours there's all sorts of support issues to work through, but I'd never really describe them as all hands on deck critical production incidents. Either way, during business hours I'm OK with incidents. That's stuff I work through as a normal part of my job. It's the after hours prod fires that I'm not OK with.\n\nHere's my anecdotes for after-hours on call incidents:\n\nCompany 1: I was called once in my 3.5 years here. The team as a whole was called a couple times I think. There weren't any during business-hours support fires either.\n\nCompany 2: Across 5 years, there was a single after-hours prod fire I had to deal with. There were some small fires during business hours, but nothing major. Even if we didn't get them fixed during business hours, we'd just wait until the next day to fix it, so it was a very casual business as usual.\n\nCompany 3: Across 2.5 years, 0 after hours calls. This company was a bit of a shit show, so they had a lot of small fires during business hours, but again nothing was ever serious enough that it couldn't wait until tomorrow morning. We were not working after 5pm.\n\nCompany 4: Only been here a year, but so far 0 after hours calls.",

From different perspectives. \nhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474623\n\nThis talks bout how employers are more likely to hire people with a genuine interest in the the topic. Particularly in CS this is true because you’re probably getting interviewed by people in their 30s/40s who went to this degree purely for passion. The rise of the job market was an upside from the desired major. \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/335277092_Exploring_factors_influencing_the_continued_interest_in_a_computer_science_major\n\nWhite paper researching the success predictors in career an education related to CS, passion was among the most important. \n\nIt’s also definitely a sentiment on a lot subreddits and in person anecdotally. I have a couple friends struggling to find jobs, but they all became programmers after a career of passion or major of passion. All the folks who majored in CS because they wanted to make games or loved coding are fine. Some had to make career pivots (leaving games industry mostly cause that market is toxic as hell). \n\nThe major is no longer the automagical 6 figure pumping major it was 10 years ago, but those who love the craft are finding jobs. Being on forums or discords about coding, going to hackathons, etc. \n\nI also should note I think this is a bad thing and always has been. Teams that require you to be really into it are usually toxic workaholics and creat a poor environment for long term retention. But now every job wants that and it’s leading to overworked and burnt out high performers and disenfranchised adequate performers. ",

It needed a product team assigned and cleaned up before it was \"production ready\", but they identified the market need, got buy-in from their manager to build something, built it, then worked with a product team to ship it.\n\nMost of our juniors work fairly simply break/fix stuff, code cleanup, and light refactor work (api v2 to api v3) until they've built enough confidence and demonstrate competency. Then we give them minor features or whatever the more senior engineers can dig up for quick hits. Then ~6-12 months after all that they're owning major enhancements on their own or they've found employment elsewhere willingly or otherwise.\n\nSenior engineers own entire product areas assigned to a product team. Product manager wants shiny new feature in the shipping module, senior engineer on the shipping team works with UI/UX and architecture to design it and implement it.\n\nStaff+ engineers own entire business domains or product verticals -- using my previous example, we have a few staff+ people in \"logistics\". Product manager, or more often chief, says logistics needs to do X Y Z for our customers by 2026.

It’s a small team and everyone on it really loves their work so it’s very fast paced and I get to make meaningful contributions all the time which is great.

What matters is that you identified a critical performance bottleneck, diagnosed the root cause of database deadlocks, and implemented a solution that increased concurrent request capacity by 50x. That's the kind of impact that makes interviewers sit up and take notice.\n\nThe startup context actually works in your favor here because it shows you can thrive in environments where you have to wear multiple hats and solve complex problems with limited resources. Frame it as a story about your problem-solving process - how you noticed the performance issues, investigated the database connection patterns, identified the deadlock scenario, and engineered a fix that dramatically improved system scalability. Interviewers love hearing about real-world debugging skills and measurable improvements to system performance. I'm on the team that built [ interview AI](http://interviews.chat), and this is exactly the type of technical story that tends to trip people up when they're trying to present it effectively, so having a tool to help you practice articulating the impact and technical details can make all the difference in landing the role.",

At the time the max db connections was about 10 which to many of us didnt make sense because the design was meant to be more than 500. Through various debugging and unit testing skills I discovered that there was a potential deadlock that went unnoticed. I presented my findings to the team and after resolving the issue we starting seeing the max db connections go up to 500 as expected\".\n\nMaybe tie in the business impact of it too. Like it saved the company millions of dollars in troubleshooting or some BS.\n\nI dont see how this story makes you look bad. You didnt make the error, you found it and fixed it. Honestly, debugging skills is something that many companies value. Because many of these codebases are complicated especially in databases. If you can find a difficult bug in a large and bad quality codebase, you can defientely do it in a large, better code quality one. I would leave it and use it as an example.

Employers are expecting devs to be fully knowledgeable of their tools and languages, but also to use AI to quadruple their output. \n\nExcept, when you begin learning this stuff in 2025, it’s very difficult to force yourself not to use AI every time you get stuck, especially when your employer is expecting you to and their deadlines reflect that.\n\nTruly understanding programming comes from writing your own code from scratch, running into problems, and spending hours and hours nearly ripping your hair out trying to fix it. You can use AI to help understand small bugs or minor new technologies, but there is no substitute for building that foundation the hard way.\n\n**What should you do?** \n\nKeep using AI to get your intern work done, you’re already in and you’re doing your job. On the side, start really learning how to program. Since you’re already using JS, and it sounds like you’re going the web dev route so far, I recommend doing [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths). Start with foundations, then do the JS course. No use of AI allowed, at all. When you get stuck, you have to research on good ol’ google. After you complete even just the first project all on your own, you’ll feel so much more knowledgeable. Don’t drop the ball, make a weekly schedule and complete the entire course. \n\nEdit: As you learn more via your individual learning and projects, start incorporating this knowledge into your intern work. Start writing your own code as much as possible, lean less and less on the AI.\n\nOnce you’ve done that, you’ll probably have enough understanding to know what you need /want to work on next, be it PHP or something else. \n\nTo touch on your comment about REST APIs, this isn’t a language, more just a concept that you can get a general understanding of in just a couple days or weeks. The more you work with them the more you’ll understand. Again, do real research on this, take notes, and then experiment with making API calls in a personal project",

        "body": "I had a guy like that on my team. He wanted the whole codebase changed basically and when he didnt get his way he'd go to Jr engineers PR and lightly suggest these nitpicky changes. \n\nI dont mind changing a variable name or a method name or even a small refactor in a file I am touching. Things that wont add a shitload of time to the PR. Like if im already making a change to a file and someone had a nitpick comment I think I can quickly add, ill add it. \n\nBut sometimes in the cases where it is beyond the scope of the PR I think doing what Sidereel said is the way to go. Most jobs reveiw you on your PRs and output. If it doesnt have a task, then they assume you didnt do it. Even if you do it yourself, it's better to create a seperate task because now you have the proof that you worked on something. Like let's say your task involves, creating a new method in Foo class to make Foo multithreaded or some BS like that. Principal Engineer who loves to nitpick, adds \"since you are touching this file, this other irrelevent method (let's call someMethod) just doesnt look good in this file and would be better used in Boo class. Please move it to Boo class\" When you look into it, you realize Foo::someMethod gets called in a few files that could take at least an hour of your time to fix, build, test, etc. You can either change it in the current PR because it's easier than having to create a new branch, rebuild, retest, etc. But the downside is when the current PR gets checked, you wont get credit for that refactor becuase that wasnt part of the task. So your manager will see all the tasks you have completed and he wont give you credit for that refactor. He will view it as the PR took you longer than it should've.   \nBut if you create a seperate task, sure it might not get fixed right away but once you do it, you will get credit for the refactor. Software enginneering is about playing the game. A piece of advice I heard was, it's better to do two tasks and show your manager all the work you did than to do 10 tasks and not say anything about it.  \n\nSome higher level engineers dont care about your career that much they care to get what they want in the codebase. They have the belief that it's on you to defend your career (which it is) and if you are going to be a pushover than so be it. \n\nI learned that mistake a little too late. When the higher level engineer ask for something, I did it with little pushback. I wasnt afraid to say something I just didnt think it was a big deal. But then my PRs had more iterations than they should've and would spend an extra day or two longer due to some of these changes this guy wanted. Guess what was said in my review session? That my PRs take a bit too long and have a bit too much iterations. Guess who told my manager that? The higher level engineer. \n\nI think if it takes too long and is outside of the range of the PR, just politely say \"I gave it a quick look. It seems that this is outside of the scope of the ticket. WE can have a quick chat and if it's really needed I can create a seperate ticket for this.\"",

Schedule 30 minute meetings with the people in your team and learn about them. What was their journey? What is there specific role in the grand equation? What about your manager? What’s their perspective of what the team does? Are there specific skills in tech you want to learn more about? Find people you work with and pry them for information.\n\nSee something you learn pretty quick is that people love flattery. And nothing is more flattering than having a young twenty-something come up to you and ask you “How did you do it?”",

I'm assuming that you are progressively getting fewer comments on your PR's, right? I'm also assuming (maybe this is wrong) that you are progressively getting larger features/tickets and writing longer PR's over time? If you're not that is not good.\n\n>or how to make the system scale,  perform better....\n\nWell you should be learning by just being in the room and being in discussions with those that are doing the actual work of scaling the system. That said, nobody in their right mind would be letting someone with 1.5 years of experience try to architect their system.\n\n> implement patterns\n\nDesign patterns really aren't that interesting. I would argue one of the big problems in this industry is people trying to overuse design patterns. Build something that works first...once that thing becomes annoyingly difficult to maintain you can try applying a design pattern.\n\n>decide as a senior engineer,\n\nYes no one is going to let you decide things. You are very junior.\n\n>That being said, I wanna still grow towards a more senior role, like a senior SWE or software architect\n\nSenior is hard position that is still a long ways off for you. A very fast promotion to senior would be 5 years. I've seen many people that were very good in their role take 10+ years to make Senior. I wouldn't worry that much about it. Keep working hard and keep asking your manager for bigger projects.\n\nAlso, enjoy this time because eventually you are going to miss it. Your job is low stress, nobody is really counting on you for anything, and you have free time. This will not last forever, you will have deadlines, many of them will be unreasonable. You will be asked to make hard decisions and then people will bitch and complain about it you for years afterwards when it doesn't work out. People will want things from you. Nonstop. You will have meetings, hours of them every day. Even outside of meetings people will want things from you. I literally have to go hide in a phone booth at the office to go heads down because people are always coming up to my desk to ask me things.\n\nSource: was Senior at Amazon and was also Staff at Google.",

You're trying to do everything at once and that's why you're advancing slow. Pick one thing and go deep for like 2-3 months. I'd suggest focusing on system design first since that's what'll get you to senior architect roles fastest.\n\nBut something most people miss is that you can actually grow within your current crappy role. Those support tickets? Start asking why they're happening. Is it bad error handling? Poor user experience? Scaling issues? Then propose solutions during team meetings. Even if they don't implement them, you're thinking like a senior engineer.\n\nDocument everything you fix and the impact. \"Fixed authentication bug that was affecting 15% of users\" sounds way better than \"did support tickets\" on your resume.\n\nAlso, start a side project that mirrors what you wish you were doing at work. Build something that scales, implement proper architecture, use modern patterns. This gives you real talking points in interviews.\n\nThe leetcode grind is overrated unless you're targeting FAANG. Focus on building stuff and understanding systems.\n\nOne more thing. Networking matters more than people think. We see this all the time at Metana with our bootcamp grads. The ones who connect with other developers, join communities, contribute to open source... they level up way faster than the ones just grinding tutorials alone.\n\nYou've got this, just need to be more strategic about where you spend that energy. Stop trying to learn everything and start building something real:)\n\nYour current job sucks but it's temporary. Use it as a stepping stone while you build the portfolio that gets you out.",

If you're applying to a .NET position, flesh out your .NET portion so people can see you have the depth of experience they need. If applying to a Python position, emphasize your Python experience. Asking about *why* you have to do that is spitting in the wind. You only have so much space for your resume, so why waste some of it on fleshing out skills that aren't relevant to the job you are applying for? If you do that, peopel are going to want to know *why* there isn't more verbiage that is *directly applicable* to the position. And that's why you get these questions.\n\nWhy don't people ask about TypeScript? Probably because it's the realm of front-end app development. It's a different ball game entirely from the types of jobs that want .NET or Python.\n\nThere is no industry rivalry between languages. Companies choose the language that best meets their needs and in-house experience. Only individuals play the \"your language sucks\" game, and for the most part that shit dies out before they hit their 30's. The ones that don't let go of it end up being insufferable to work with, and walking examples for why soft skills matter.",

It seemed like it was worthwhile, as I really wanted to expand my horizons and I feel I'm valuable as a leader. The politics were very difficult, sometimes. The work piled up, as I was expected to be an IC sometimes, help other ICs, run a team, and help run a department. Meanwhile, the pay did not scale with the work, and in fact the job opportunities compared to IC opportunities were not as sustainable. This meant less jobs open, and lower salaries at the top end compared with other senior engineering positions. \n\nI feel that you have to find the right situation with a manager who can effectively protect your time and scope, so you aren't doing too much. You also need help, politically, so you're not swimming upstream against people more senior than yourself. Of course, you have to be pretty dedicated to doing a good job, on top of that. It's a lot. \n\nI do believe that there are probably thousands of successful engineering managers/leads, but I also believe that many are burned out or are burning out. Maybe if you feel excited, it's worth trying, but if you keep getting burned out, it's time to retreat back to the IC world. I'm honestly still trying to figure out what I'd do next.

Not everyone on my team has the skills to manage epic level work streams, but everyone is forced to try. Once you can delegate the work streams, the job then becomes about planning what those work streams will be, coordinating the various stakeholders, and inevitably dealing with whatever crisis comes up.\n\nWhen an engineer is under-performing, it's on them to ask for the help they need. With 8 people on the team, that's a lot of individual work to over see, and I imagine it'd be all consuming. Therefore, it's okay to look out for the engineers on your team, make sure they have the work streams they need for a good review, but you need to let them do the work and decide when they need help. I'll never be able to apply my own standards to under-performers, but to some extent doesn't it doesn't matter. If an engineer isn't a net benefit to the project, and I can't help them become one, I just involve management and we deal with it that way. Team lead is not a people management job: it's not command, but the soft power of influence.\n\nAt least on my team, as a lead I try to focus on three things: planning, communication with other teams, and review of our execution. Most of my focus is on long term planning, and the sprint plans are basically up to the engineers. After all, the team lead is in a unique position of owning the outcome of the team, that all parts fit together and contribute to whatever goal management put you on. From that view, the single most important thing you can do is ensuring the project is going in the right direction.\n\nDoing a great job as a team lead, you'll essentially make yourself redundant. Most of the work you are describing, could be by the people on the team with only a little coordination cost.",

From my experience, 99% of new devs (interns, salaried, contract, whatever) get that same feeling when jumping into an established company with an established codebase. No reasonable person will expect you to \"just get it\" right off the bat. Keep asking questions until it clicks. It's the only way you will learn.\n\nThat said, what I wish I had done much sooner was to just spend time with the software. Poke around. Get a feel for what the user's experience will be. Try to understand what problem it is that your software is trying to solve.\n\nFor me, I jumped into smart agriculture development with zero farm experience. It wasn't until I sat in a combine and just drove around for a day that I understood why x button is there, why menu z is nested in menu y, etc.\n\nFrom there, you can start to understand the hows and whys of the software design. Most frameworks just tackle one area (except maybe for the \"we've got it all\" frameworks like Qt), so understand what frameworks/middleware you're using and, more importantly, why you're using it.\n\nAnother thing you can do it almost any industry is look at other people's PRs. Presuming the title is \"fixed a bug where x would happen when you do y\", make a chain in your head between x and y and the chunk of code that was modified. It's a decent way to start connecting those dots. Plus, informally, it looks very good if you can say \"oh yeah, I saw something about that in Tim's PR\" since it shows you're engaged and taking an active interest.\n\nOn a less technical note, nobody gets mad at the new guy for asking questions because they understand it's all a lot to take in. They have all been exactly where you are right now. What people DO get upset with is a developer who has been onboard for 6 months, a year, 3 years, or whatever and still doesn't know some of the basic things. Ask questions, take organized notes.\n\nOtherwise, if you have any specific questions about the industry you're in, what frameworks you're using, etc, feel free to ask her and we can lend a hand or at least point you in the right direction!",

You are not dumb, my friend.\n\nMy advice is to find a colleague, maybe someone in your team or someone who’s working on something you’re curious about/interested in, and schedule a 30 minute meeting with them. Ask them about their journey and their role in the company. And then talk to them about yourself and your journey. If you like the conversation, make it a point to speak to them regularly. Congratulations, you just got yourself a mentor.\n\nThe mentor will look out for you. They’ll give you some guidance and hopefully show you the ropes. They can help you parse the code base. And if they don’t have an exact answer, chances are they know someone who does. They’ll help facilitate those other connections. See, something you learn is that people love flattery. And there’s nothing more flattering than a young person latching on to you and seeking you out because you gave them clarity. That’s the power of networking.\n\nBest of luck out there. Deep breaths.

        "body": "My dude. You have been doing this for a year. Everyone knows you are not good enough and no one is expecting you to be. There is a reason you are a junior dev and not a senior dev.\n\nThat being said a few words of advice from someone who's been doing this for 11 years.\n\n  \n1. The fact that you can acknowledge this at all and care about it puts you ahead of the game. This was all of us at one point, myself included. I basically lied to get my first job because I was so desperate and then I had to deliver. What did I do? I wasn't the smartest person in the room but I was willing to work more than anyone around me. I worked nights and weekends, not every one but when I had the time, I was working all the time. You don't have to do this forever, but I would recommend this to any dev new on the job. Absolve yourself of the idea of \"work life balance\", cause if you wanna be good and you aren't naturally gifted, its not gunna happen. Don't get me wrong, I still played hard on the weekends when I had time, but most likely, you are young and have very little responsibilities and you need to take advantage of that. Yourself in 10 years will be on your knees thanking you.\n\n2. I had a great professor in college that told me something I never forgot. \"A great developer has read for 15 minutes for every line of code he writes\". You need to read. Read everything, read all the docs of all the tools you're using, know them front and back. Read books, clean code, clean architecture (these are terrible books btw but you need to know them), gang of four, anything you can get your hands on about programming, read it and know it.\n\n3. You need to be kinder to yourself. Believing that you can do it is 90% of the game. Instill some fight into your spirit and dig in. No one is going to advocate for you like you can advocate for yourself. Positive affirmations, whatever it takes, you have to believe you are capable.  \n  \nIf this shit was easy, literally everyone and there mom would do it. There is a reason it demands a premium in pay. I believe in you, you can do this, its gunna take some work, but you have an opportunity here to build a career that people would kill for. Make the most of it!",

They give you work anyways, and it's worth it. Because training juniors is important for the future of the company's workforce (and the industry as a whole).

I joined the industry more than a decade ago, and things have already changed substantially. Even if we assume AI takes the first rung of coding jobs, the difficult part of software was never writing code, it's figuring out what we need the code to do, navigating various corporate processes, and knowing that the code we write will work as we intend it. What I see happening, is that in 5-10 years, programmers will be super-efficient, and our job will look more like a tech or team lead that serves as the owner for the code and interfaces with management and stakeholder.\n\nAnyway, software isn't going anywhere, it's going to continue changing, but no matter what, we're going to have more software in 20 years than we do today, and someone is going to have to build it, or at least be the person responsible for it.\n\nJob security in software doesn't come down to the coding skills, it comes down to all the non-coding skills you have. Are you experienced enough to learn new concepts? Can you lead a team? How well do you do working on ambiguous problems? Do you have a track record of producing results in difficult environments? How well do you work with others? These are the driving questions that determine employ-ability. You'll learn how to pass software coding assessments in school, but after that, employ ability boils down to the ability to contribute to companies bottom line. That's never going to change!",

The job market is BRUTAL for entry level CS jobs and you might not have the “fire” to outcompete the other candidates (many senior level and mid level engineers also competing for entry level roles). Also AI is going to take out a LOT of entry/mid level CS jobs very soon. You need to seriously consider if you have what it takes to make it in this industry given these market dynamics. If you feel like you have the drive.. then go for it and you may succeed.. but you need to be honest with yourself and consider a different, more stable field if you don’t have the passion for this field. Best of luck!",

Your problem is you haven't put any effort to learning things outside of a work environment. Building microservices, apps, and websites, etc. is best learned by doing. If you don't get direct experience at work, do those things outside of work. Build an iOS app and put it on the app store. Realize how much effort goes into making a good product. Then you know what these companies are dealing with. Bugs, latency, security, user experience, marketing. There's a whole world of engineering you're excluding yourself from because of a lack of agency.  ",
