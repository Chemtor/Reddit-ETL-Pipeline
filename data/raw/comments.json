With so many applicants being shrunk down to 21 people I imagine you were able to pick exactly who you thought could just slot right in with no training.\n\nYou had 9 out of 21 fail the phone screen.  I assume this is mostly vibe based and general work based.  So I can understand why 9 failed.\n\nYou then had 3 out of 12 people fail the data challenge.  I assume this was a basic data challenge to ensure you weren't just lying about credentials.  Which makes it odd that 25% failed, but again I can understand it.\n\nBut then 5 out of 9 failed the tech review.  I find that odd that so many failed.  Was it an experience issue with the tech stack.  Is this where technical questions about the tech stack were asked?\n\nAnything you would have wished gone different?  I find the funnel here to be very lopsided.  Do you think it would have been better to start with more than the 21 initial candidates?",

That’s rare.\n* **Zero-Copy + Arrow Interop**: Shares memory with Arrow without copying — great for performance.\n* **Pushdown Compute on Compressed Data**: If supported, this is huge — filter/compute without decompressing.\n* **Forward-Compatible WASM Decompression**: You can ship a new encoding + its logic *inside* the file.\n* **Handles Ultra-Wide Tables**: O(1) access to 100k+ columns using FlatBuffers.\n\n# ❌ What It Gets Wrong (or Needs Work)\n\n* **Still immature**: Tooling is limited. No wide adoption (e.g., no Spark/Presto/DuckDB support).\n* **Too complex for most**: Great for low-level devs, but not plug-and-play for typical data teams.\n* **IPC Format = WIP**: This is critical for streaming/cloud-native workflows — and it’s not finished.\n* **Limited language support**: Rust and Python are solid; Java/Go/Scala? Not there yet.\n* **No benchmarks vs Parquet/Arrow**: Claims are strong, but I want charts.\n\n# ⚖️ Bottom Line\n\nVortex is **not** a Parquet replacement (yet), but it’s potentially **better** in specialized cases — like in-browser data tools, embedded systems, or custom DB engines.\n\nIf you love performance and control, it’s worth watching.  \nIf you need stable tooling and integrations, maybe hold off.",

There are tons of open datasets that you can practice using Spark on. Check on Kaggle, lichess, Google Big query sample data (for this one you cna get Google credits then write out these large datasets to parquet then you are good).\n\nI have to say that Spark was quite intimidating when I started around 6y ago but there are a lot of good materials out there.\n\n\nEdit: you will require basic sql knowledge but I would learn this via Spark APIs eg.

The Apache stack is a good place to start as it is free. Be warned, it is not easy with the configuration especially if you are a noob. You can also use the Databricks free edition to practice; and perhaps sign up for the databricks academy whilst you are at it.\n\nAlso, it is best that you also learn how to set up a linux virtual machine (to run your cluster), bash, get familiar with the linux terminal commands, and master SQL. The common sql flavours are Hive, Spark, Trino and PostGres. Heck even kafka uses its own brand of SQL. Learning PySpark is also useful, especially for Spark transformations and when using the Databricks platform. Learning Java is useful if you need to go deeper into those tools, as those big data tools by Apache run on Java, and the latest and greatest features are released on Java first. Learning git and docker (containerisation) is also useful for an infrastructure as code approach.\n\nIf you are intending to just be a user of Big Data platforms, just skip ahead to mastering SQL and PySpark.\n\nYou can also consider learning cloud infrastructure too (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) as they have their own flavours of big data infrastructure which is another rabbit hole to venture into. They have their own courses and certification programmes.\n\nFor a more holistic education, reading books on data warehousing, data lakes and delta lakes would cap it off nicely. The books by Kimball on data warehousing are one of such \"bibles\".\n\nLastly, you can consider proper schools. In my country, there are short courses by local polytechnics and universities for undergrads and post-grads, with substantial government subsidies on the course fees.",

Just off the top of my head:\n\n- To make calculations consistent across teams. If teams across large orgs aren't sharing code with one another (as what typically happens), one team might calculate the same KPI slightly differently from another. This is just an extension of the single source of truth logic that guides a silver layer.\n\n- Not all analysts on all teams are going to be technically proficient enough to produce the aggregated data they need. That's a great aspirational goal, maybe FAANG gets there with their amazing pickings. But for 99% of orgs, that just isn't happening.\n\n- Some analysts re-query the same data sets *a lot* during development.

You need experience as the end consumer of a data stack (or lack thereof), have some comfort with software engineering as opposed to simply \"knowing how to code\", and put in the work to learn how to build and maintain the plumbing that enables data to make its journey from source to business value. This last part takes years of work.\n\nThe most common story I see (and mine is more or less the same): STEM major works as DS/DA/BI analytics/similar position. Slowly starts contributing to the data stack, at first with small contributions and incident reporting/response, then with more substantial contributions. They either make the switch in-house or move jobs and suddenly find themselves in a position of autonomy to build. From this point you become a DE in a few months, by definition.\n\nI suggest you *don't* look for DE positions. Look for any other job as a data practitioner, and try to slowly move upstream on the data stack from there. It really does take years.",

You are given much more autonomy than working in house because your client assumes you know what you're doing based on your price tag and the fact your sales team probably sold you to them as an \"expert\".

So imagine you have a 15GB CSV or parquet file -- this is a hassle to open up with most of viewer tools (excel, etc), what DataKit is good at (because of DuckDB-WASM being in its core) is opening this file in 2, 3 seconds - but for so many folks this was not enough. I kept hearing i want to also bring my DBMS tables here to do a preview/analysis alongside the other files. So you can bring a dataset from HuggingFace, connect to postgres, open up an excel file, connect to motherduck, etc all at the same place. Does that give more and less why this is added?",

It is called “pocket mining” and I am not aware that any of it is done outside of that little corner. ...\n\n>Pocket hunting is an ingenious process. You take a spadeful of earth from the hill-side and put it in a large tin pan and dissolve and wash it gradually away till nothing is left but a teaspoonful of fine sediment. Whatever gold was in that earth has remained, because, being the heaviest, it has sought the bottom. Among the sediment you will find half a dozen yellow particles no larger than pin-heads. You are delighted. You move off to one side and wash another pan. If you find gold again, you move to one side further, and wash a third pan. If you find *no* gold this time, you are delighted again, because you know you are on the right scent.\n\n>You lay an imaginary plan, shaped like a fan, with its handle up the hill—for just where the end of the handle is, you argue that the rich deposit lies hidden, whose vagrant grains of gold have escaped and been washed down the hill, spreading farther and farther apart as they wandered. And so you proceed up the hill, washing the earth and narrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that you are outside the spread of the fan; and at last, twenty yards up the hill your lines have converged to a point—a single foot from that point you cannot find any gold. Your breath comes short and quick, you are feverish with excitement; the dinner-bell may ring its clapper off, you pay no attention; friends may die, weddings transpire, houses burn down, they are nothing to you; you sweat and dig and delve with a frantic interest—and all at once you strike it! Up comes a spadeful of earth and quartz that is all lovely with soiled lumps and leaves and sprays of gold. Sometimes that one spadeful is all—$500. Sometimes the nest contains $10,000, and it takes you three or four days to get it all out. The pocket-miners tell of one nest that yielded $60,000 and two men exhausted it in two weeks, and then sold the ground for $10,000 to a party who never got $300 out of it afterward.\n\nMark Twain, \"Roughing It\"\n\nAbout sums it up.

It really is a breeze, you data size sounds like you are always in a small warehouse. One important aspect is your query patterns. A warehouse starts running with a single query and remains running for at least a minute after the last query (if configured to auto suspend). If you have something that queries the data periodically, like every five minutes, this will add up very fast. The smallest warehouse is like 3k per month full time running at the higher plans, so keep that in mind.\n\nWhat I think I would recommend is a combination of Snowflake and something opensource you can run yourself, using Iceberg tables. Do the heavy lifting in Snowflake, doe the simple querying with your own computer. We are eying that currently, and I think we will save around 50% on our Snowflake bill.",

It costs $X for Y compute, and $2X for 2Y compute, and so on.\n\nThey give you a free trial to figure out your estimated costs for your usage. It's easy to determine $X/Y ratio.\n\nIt scales up and down so you can match supply (Monday morning rush, end of month workloads, that new ML experiment you want to try, basically turn off on nights and weekends) with compute demand. The important thing about the cloud is you can rent compute elastically.\n\nBUT\n\nthat $X/Y ratio for compute in Snowflake (compared to other options including DIY) is a bit of premium, because it's a SaaS and everything is managed for you \\*and\\* they are offering a lot of functionality - particularly GenAI, enterprise-grade DR, data sharing, etc - that you may not need.\n\nIt's up to you to decide if you'll avail yourself of that functionality to justify the premium pricing Snowflake charges.\n\nSo the math is simple:\n\nDIY/open source/IaaS is lower capex (\"Free!\\*\\*\\*\") + a lot of opex (\"pay people to manage it\") for ... a highly variable set of functionality. (Good luck doing AI on open source Postgres)\n\nPaaS/SaaS is higher capex (\"Snowflake is expensive!\") + very little opex (\"this thing runs itself\") for ... a fairly robust set of functionality.\n\nSo in my opinion it's not really about the size of your data and more what you (and in your case, your tenants) intend to do with it.\n\nWhen my old boss was buying new chairs for the office, he said something that stuck with me: \"When you buy something cheap, and you use it every day, you start to hate yourself for being so cheap. When you buy something expensive, and you don't use it at all, you start to hate yourself for being so careless. Be sure before you buy something you know how often you're going to use it.\"\n\nPS: I work at Databricks where basically the same logic applies, so you can trust what I wrote here, I don't say nice things about Snowflake as a rule, but they are a high quality product at a high quality price. Don't think of it as \"needlessly\" expensive  -  think of it as \"am I going to use it in a way to deliver the value I'm trying to pay for?\"",

I’m a DE but do all of our orgs data modeling and admin over our dbt environment.",

We've seen tons of companies move from exactly your setup (PowerBI + expensive compute that runs 24/7) to ClickHouse and it usually works really well for retail drill-down scenarios (we have a very large retail customer at Tinybird doing exactly that - unfortunately I can't mention them by name).\n\nClickHouse is that is quite literally built for this kind of workload - fast aggregations across massive datasets with arbitrary groupings. Your use case (drilling down by UPC, store, category, department) is pretty much textbook OLAP stuff that CH excels at.\n\nA few things to consider though:\n\n1. You'll still need to think about your data modeling. ClickHouse works best when you denormalize things into wide tables, which might mean rethinking how you structure your retail data\n\n2. The PowerBI integration exists but it's not as smooth as native connectors. You might want to test the performance of PowerBI queries hitting ClickHouse before committing\n\n3. Consider whether you actually need PowerBI at all for this. Are you embedding a PowerBI dashboard into a user-facing app? If so, any reason not to ditch it and just build some data APIs and a custom dashboard UI?\n\nDruid is also solid for this but ClickHouse has better SQL support and is generally easier to work with imo.\n\nI'd definitely recommend spinning up a ClickHouse instance and loading a subset of your data to test query performance before making any big decisions. But yeah, this seems like exactly the kind of problem ClickHouse was designed to solve.",

Challenges with OBTs include:\n\n   * Some reporting tools prefer or expect dimensional models\n   * Even with columnar storage there are performance impacts from having a large number of columns, especially high-cardinality, long strings.\n   * If you are keeping raw data so that you can rebuild your OBT, then you already need versioned models, which is the hard part of dimensional modeling, to support rebuilding it.\n   * Without dimension tables getting a consistent cross-tab with all possible dimension values isn't possible.  The best you can do is spend too much time querying to get all dimension values found in your dataset, which may be missing critical dimension values.\n   * Redacting PII or other data is vastly simpler in a dimension table of 100,000 rows than in a OBT of 400 columns and 10,000,000,000 rows.\n   * Sometimes people want to see dimensions associated with an event from some other time then when the event occurred.  For example, what's the contact for this customer *now*, or name of this company *now*, or what was the industry category for the customer at the end of last year?  All of this is trivial for a dimensional model and impossible for OBT.\n   * Usability sucks with a OBT with 250+ columns\n   * etc, etc, etc, etc\n\nFor this reason I see OBTs as an occasional early version, but dimensional models as the feature-rich mature version of most analytical databases.",

Be fine with it.  Do a great job? Feel proud, but don't let it get to your head.  People being shitty to you when you're trying to improve? Ignore them and keep your head down.  This is all part of learning and improving.\n\nSecond advice - if you want to be concretely better at stuff, only use LLMs when you want to save time doing things you already know how to do.  If you use LLMs to completely generate the output you are looking for, you will end up with huge gaps in your knowledge.  People hate the idea of spending time learning things, lean on LLMs to do everything for them, and in a few years wonder rage on Reddit about how they can't get a job because they get rejected for trying to use an LLM during an interview.",

So, there's no reason to try to appear more than you are at the moment. Approach them with some honest questions. You've already got the job and it sounds like you are producing at a level that is expected/acceptable. Go easy on yourself, and ask lots of questions about how you could improve your submissions, or ask about terms that are unfamiliar. Everyone starts at the beginning, and NOBODY learns EVERYTHING in school. \n\nGet to know them and you might find that they have some additional resources for you that are directly relevant to the kind of work you are doing. You may even find out that a few of them struggled in the beginning, just like yourself.\n\nIf you don't want to get too personal, you could always just ask them directly about some of their favorite resources like books, YouTubers, or podcasts because you want to continue to grow. \n\nAlso, keep posting here. Everyone wants to help and mentors are hard to find. \n\nIf you don't already have a daily reader, I highly suggest the Confidence Gap on audible. I feel like most of what it says is blatantly obvious but helps to hear it come from someone else. There's some tips in here about imposter syndrome and it might ease your conscience a little bit.",

It focuses on how highly technical people can communicate (including speaking) better without being \"overly\" technical.  I think this will directly address some of your issues.\n\nRelated are two other books that aren't specifically for \"technical\" issues, but rather general human communication.  They both aim for convincing or persuading, which isn't what you are asking for.  However, they get to the heart of what drives other humans, so maybe they will help.  Don't read them as \"how do I sell stuff\" but rather, what do (non-technical) people care about? What motivates them?  \n\n\"How to win friends and influence people\" by Carnegie and  \"Influence: the psycology of persuasion\" by Cialdini.",

If you can’t give a yes or no to a request then you’re not as technically able as you think. If your caveats to a yes to that request are around technical implementation instead of business cases then you’re not in the right role. \n\nIf a request is very high leverage then you say yes and work to figure it out. You don’t let every possible technical roadblock kill the project. If the request is low leverage and is easy to implement then you say no because it doesn’t move the ball forward. \n\nThat’s the job. If you’re good enough to craft excellent systems WHILE delivering what the company needs then good for you. You’re extremely valuable. But there are priorities. \n\nOdds are your issue is that you don’t actually have the vision for leverage. Not that you don’t know how to speak to other people.",

What was it?\" If there's something that already exists that can serve as a starting point and provide a common understanding that can greatly ease the process.

And it's heavily focused on the parts you can copy/paste from articles or stackoverflow (basic email regex, basic dockerfile, basic fastapi setup), not the parts for which an actual data engineer is needed (considerations for filetypes, data structures, algorithms, partitioning, larger-than-memory processing, multi-node processing, data lineage, access control, data quality for a team of at least 10 to 20 contributors, etc).\n\nIf you're humble, open-minded, you connect with the team, and you learn from them: all good. As long as you have enough understanding of the fundamentals (intuitive understanding, not leetcode), we can teach you the rest.\n\nIf, instead, you feel bad about being considered a Junior at first, you feel a constant need to talk about having been Lead Solution Eng. in the past, and it's distracting you from learning the job -> won't last.\n\nPay/salary would be Junior while you grow to Medior. If you have more experience than I would have guessed, or you learn faster, I could see someone get that raise within 3 months. If you have a normal trajectory instead, it would usually happen after 3+ years.\n\n----\n\ntl;dr: Seems like a lot of info, it boils down to:\n\n- Is going from Lead Solution Engineer to Data Engineering your genuine passion/interest? If it is, enjoy it, enjoy learning, let go of expectations. If it isn't, reconsider. It seems more sideways than upwards, which means reskilling.\n- Impostor syndrome can come from your expectations for yourself. You've never worked in this field, it's not appropriate to have expectations. Become a student again. Focus on learning the needs of the role, not on yourself / your self-doubt / your perception of yourself.",

Nothing else matters, and can be seen as a negative/distraction. You could learn >99% of technologies in the world and still not get a job if you didn't learn the 1 technology the company needed.\n\nFind yourself a company that can use your background beneficially (instead of seeing it as a negative), and that's willing to give you support to fill in the gaps while you're learning.\n\nI would say \"that's it\", but to be honest whether or not you find a company like that depends 100% on the individual hiring managers you will meet/interview, and you do need to get lucky.\n\nBut the good news is that no impostor syndrome is ever needed on this path.",

I would ask a candidate 1) what is the software engineering concept not being followed that is causing this mess (my answer: lack of DRY models and not having one purpose per model) 2) How would you go about fixing this? (my answer: start with a model used for BI consumption, understand its source tables and columns, check column level lineage for each column, come up with a plan to consolidate intermediate models after understanding each column calculation) 3) How do you prevent this in the future? (My answer: create a strong culture of preplanning and peer review, alerting based on some measure of DAG messiness in the CI pipeline)\n\nGoing from “I just know general dbt concepts and execute them” to “I can make your data ecosystem stronger with my dbt skills and promote of a culture of engineering excellence” will take you way further.",

The shift toward treating data infrastructure more like software has been one of the biggest changes I've seen over the past few years.\n\nI think the \"data is too messy\" argument is kinda missing the point though. Like yeah, data is messy and unpredictable in ways that traditional software isn't, but that's exactly why you need better tooling and processes around it. The messiness doesn't go away just because you're cowboy coding your way through it.\n\nThe schema as code thing is huge. We believe very strongly in general \"data as code\" principles at Tinybird (all resources defined as code and managed with version control). Seen a lot of people get burned because their production schema drifted from what they thought it was, or they made an upstream change that broke downstream consumers without realizing it. Having that versioned and trackable is just basic hygiene at this point.\n\nThe local dev environment piece is important too. One thing that I love about webdev, specifically Next.js, is just spinning up that local next server and getting instant feedback on front end changes. We've focused on that a lot at Tinybird, making it easier for people to not only spin up ClickHouse locally, but actually test the whole pipeline end-to-end including ingestion and API layer. It's a huge shift in the right direction imo.\n\nI guess the key is not just blindly copying SE practices but adapting them for data's unique challenges. Like CI/CD for data pipelines needs to handle things like data quality checks, schema validation, backfill strategies etc that traditional software CI/CD doesn't really deal with.",

Log-based CDC solves that but yeah, the tooling is mostly built for full-on streaming pipelines, not lightweight batch.\n\nThere's a couple open-source options like `mysqlbinlog` or libraries like `go-mysql` and `maxwell`, but they’re super low-level. You end up writing a lot of glue code just to get something usable. Some folks hack together scripts that tail binlogs, write them to disk, and then batch-load into analytics systems, but that’s pretty fragile long-term.\n\nAre you pushing this into a warehouse? How often do you need fresh data? And how complex are your schemas (lots of deletes/updates or mostly inserts)?\n\nFor what it’s worth, I work at Estuary, and we actually do log-based CDC (including MySQL binlogs) but abstract all the hard parts away. It’s more like “click to connect” and you get real-time or batched syncs with very little to manage. Kind of like Fivetran but way more flexible and with a transparent pricing.",

Keeping all that infra running just to read binlogs in a small team setting didn’t feel worth it.\n\nOne project I recently came across that sits right in this middle ground is OLake. Instead of going full streaming, it can just read from MySQL/Postgres logs in a more batch or micro batch oriented way - like you schedule a sync job with Airflow or cron or they even have temporal integrated in their UI offering, and it picks up exactly what changed. No \"updated\\_at\" hacks, no Kafka clusters.\n\nCouple of things I liked about it:\n\n* It talks to the binlogs directly, so correctness is better than column-based filtering.\n* You can still run it in “batch or micro-batch” mode, so you don’t have to keep another service always-on.\n* It writes data straight to open formats like Iceberg or simple parquets in object store, so downstream analytics feels natural.\n\nIt’s open source and lightweight (basically a Docker container you can run anywhere), so might be worth a peek if you’re looking for that sweet spot between *timestamp columns* and *full streaming infra*.\n\nRepo here if you want to poke around → [https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake)",

Matching the players will be non-trivial, because different sources aren't consistent about use of nicknames, suffixes like Jr., or exactly how to write names (Ja'Marr vs Jamaar).\n\nThen it's reasonable to build a medallion architecture. Bronze layer is raw html snapshots (or maybe jsons from an api). Then have an ETL process to turn those into tabular data with a consistent format and names (and/or an arbitrary player id) and store in the silver layer. If you want to get fancy that could be a sql database with a few tables (rankings, sites, players). It could also be a csv. Then another process to aggregate by player across sites and store in the gold layer (if you want you could automate collecting daily snapshots and analyze the change over time). That might be something like another sql table that exists to serve a dashboard.\n\nSports is just one example, there are lots of domains where you could scrape (or otherwise obtain) multiple sources of data then (fuzzy) join and aggregate them. If you don't want to do fuzzy matching and multiple scrapers/interfaces, you could do daily snapshots of something like pokmeon card prices or the weather and aggregate across time. This sort of thing is a common use case for a simple but non-trivial data pipeline.",

        "body": "TL;DR: gather requirements and build something that works for YOUR use case. Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that wasn’t built to meet the functionality you need from your system.\n\nI personally like the medallion architecture in principle, but this is the classic issue with it: shoehorning your specific use case into a framework that doesn’t work for you. \n\nThe medallion works well for what it’s meant to because it encompasses separation of concerns, e.g. land raw, untouched data in ‘raw’, cast, parse, and make data workable in ‘stg’, then join and aggregate data into usable datasets in ‘gold’/‘marts’. This makes trouble shooting easier and pipeline creation systematic. \n\nYou architecture says to hell with that but let’s call it “medallion”. It’s not, when you modify data in “raw” it’s no longer actually… raw… the medallion architecture also wasn’t built with data catalogs (thinking catalogs in the observability sense, I.e a data dictionary, you may have a different meaning. Too many new buzzwords) or semantic layer in mind. It was built as a framework for what are now data/analytics engineers to systematically build pipelines. \n\nWith that being said, forget the idea of using medallion architecture for your use case. Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that isn’t meant support your functional requirements. I don’t like the idea of joining tables or building incremental models in “bronze”, but if it makes sense for your use case then great. Is it because you need that data for backfills/full refreshes of your catalog layer? Maybe use s3 to store that in partitioned files instead. Have a team super familiar with sql/dbt but not familiar with how to integrate with s3 and would be a hassle to train? Then that solution is out of the picture. \n\nOne last thing: report specific layers are dumb imo. Don’t do that. That’s how you get one report that says revenue was X and another that says revenue was Y because analyst B was working with VP C who doesn’t believe GAAP needs to be followed precisely and wanted his dashboard to make him feel good. Or you’ll just get duplicate queries/tables. We have an “analytics”/metrics/semantic layer organized by what fact table it stems from. That’s what works for us, it may not work for you, but we designed it to work for our use case and tech stack",

        "body": "I'm not sure where the confusion is. We are exactly making sure not to shoehorn our requirements to fit into a framework that isn't built to meet the functionality needed for our system.\n\nThat's the entire point of the post and my comments here. Whenever there is a use case that comes in front of us that doesn't fit into the way we've structured our DBT project, we figure out how to fit it in, we don't change the requirements to fit how we're doing things.\n\nMaybe someone can actually expand on the downvotes to my comment instead of pointing out other things instead? I could be completely wrong with what I said, but I can't learn anything if we're not actually responding to anything specific in my downvoted reply. Only thing I can think of is that maybe DBT's recommendations have evolved since they've added semantic layers, since you would generally want to build semantic layers on top of your silver layer, so it should definitely fit somewhere into the DBT project.\n\nAs far as how the medallion architecture works, I've seen what I've said recommended here and elsewhere before. It's like you said, just do what fits your use case. When you say raw, you mean something more raw than I might. When people at my company say raw, they mean something that you can use to rebuild anything that's raw. That might be renaming fields back to their original names, reconstructing an original field, or casting numeric columns back to varchars.\n\nThat being said, I agree with you that once you starting doing more complex stuff like incrementals, joins, etc., it stops being a view into the original raw data and starts to become something more.\n\nHowever, if you asked me if these models more closely represented raw data in a bronze layer or business entities in a silver layer, I would tell you that these models more closely represented raw data. This is because the entire intention of these models are to surface a more curated view into the raw layer. They answer questions like \"I see that X from this data source is being mapped to Y in this other data source, why are these data sources related this way?\" Then you can go into the models for each data source and see how they've been transformed so that those models can be related together.\n\nFor example, maybe there's some fuzzy search logic that builds an incremental mapping for related columns shared by the 2 data sources which then gets joined into each model. Does this change the raw data in any way other than adding new fields to these datasets? No, but is this logic that we think is simple enough that we would justify doing it on top of our source data? No. And does the result represent a business entity? Still no, because the business entity would probably be these 2 datasets joined or unioned together.\n\nHaving said that, if your problem with my original post and not my comment is that I classified that layer as \"bronze\" and don't want me to call it that, that's fine. That's not my intention and frankly I don't care what it's called, I just chose to call it (in parentheses) something I thought others would understand. Maybe I didn't explain it very clearly in my original post, feel free to let me know.\n\nFor your last note, thanks for the suggestion. I agree, we try to shy away from report-specific stuff as much as we can unless we have a really specific use case that really doesn't fit with what everyone else is doing (some nasty period-over-period metrics for example). I like your idea of an \"analytics\" layer instead, makes perfect sense.",

You’ll probably want to also tie datasets back to specific reports depending on the analysts capabilities in your organization. You should also structure this better with a historical table and what not - just explaining an example approach and not a perfect ERD. \n\nIf analysts are viewing reports (and not building) then it might make sense to have a warning label on each report that appears when the dataset is considered stale. This will depend on your analysts tooling though and if they’re viewing raw data, using bi tools, etc. \n\nYou could also use something as simple as an email group with email notifications when pipelines fail.

If the former, you probably want to consider a meaningful partitioning strategy based on query patterns to help with predicate push down/partition pruning. If you’re going to move it to another system (like synapse) or file (parquet based file store) then id recommend using an ingestion time partition strategy.\n\nI usually like to do something like: source_name/object_name/ingestion_date=<iso_date>/<file_name>.json\n\nAlso, bronze is usually synonymous with raw, but at the end of the day these terms are just trying to bucket specific concepts into language so nothing is perfect.",

Also pulsehook is much easier to setup compared to cloudwatch. \n\nI got perplexity to do some research on it comparing the two. Here is the short excerpt from it:\n\nIf you just need to know whether your cron jobs or data scripts ran and succeeded (plus error details for debugging), PulseHook is way simpler and cloud-agnostic. It’s built for developers who want fast setup and easy alerts. AWS CloudWatch is much more powerful but focused on deep infrastructure/app monitoring for everything in AWS—great for big teams, but overkill if you just want lightweight job status alerts. PulseHook works anywhere; CloudWatch is best if you’re already all-in on AWS.",

Along with that we'll remove our Power BI web service scheduled refreshes for our models and instead have Power Automate jobs that start at maybe 5:30am and wait for their related rows to exist in that status table, then kick off the model refreshes. The Power Automate jobs would time out by maybe 6:30am. This way if the ETL didn't finish in time for automated analytics emails etc, then those emails will just send with the day-old data and models will wait until the next day (or manually refreshes when I check on it).",

That doesn't mean you have to instantly address it, but it does tell you when there's potential work to be done.\nLooking at it from a \"pull\" perspective is totally valid from a mathematical perspective too, but I think looking at it in terms of what downstream tables aren't up to date may be a bit easier to think through.",

If you happen to experience bugs or anything weird please report as a Github issue or in the #dbt-fusion-engine community slack channel\n2. you're right to call out that the Fusion CLI and VS Code extension are different things, but overlap slightly.\n3. Forgive me if I get long-winded, I'm a former teacher, so always love a good lecture / teaching opportunity. Please let me know what of my explanation clicks (and what doesn't!)\n\nOn launch three months ago, we published the blog: [The Components of the dbt Fusion engine and how they fit together](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components). It's worth a full read, but I wanted to paraphrase the section about [the VS Code extension and Language Server](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components#the-dbt-vs-code-extension-and-language-server).\n\nThere's actually 3 components worth calling out:\n\n1. The Fusion CLI binary (basically the equivalent of dbt Core but in Rust)\n2. The Fusion Language Server binary (a.k.a LSP)\n3. The VS Code extension\n\nA language server share a great deal of code with the Fusion CLI but it's intended user is not a human in a terminal, but rather an IDE who can talk to it on behalf of the user. When you download or update the VS Code extension you might notice that in the bottom status bar it will say: \"Downloading file\" that's the extension grabbing the latest version of the Language Server from our CDN.\n\nIn it there's a pretty diagram (made by yours truly) that shows that the VS Code extension has two buckets of features broken out by the binary that powers them\n\n1. **by the CLI**: running commands, previewing models\n2. **by the LSP**: intellisense, lineage, go to reference\n\n  \nIn a comment \n\n>So can I access the enhanced features in fusion without using the extension in another IDE?\n\nTheoretically, the Fusion LSP could be made to work with and distributed such that it could work with other IDEs like you say. However, the reality is today that it only works with VS Code and VS Codium-based IDES (i.e. Cursor & Windsurf). If we hear of enough demand for other IDEs (emacs, JetBrains), we'll certainly make it happen there as well.",

If you have access to python and pandas, use it. Doing this entirely in VBA macros would be challenging. If your team has access to their own database server, that might be an option as well. The question will be where that script will live and run on a daily basis. \n\nThe other challenge you are facing sounds like understanding how to join your data sources to get the desired output, and it sounds like even the final output structure might not be fully defined yet. You need to know exactly what level of detail your final output should be and work backwards on how to get there. My understanding as you described it, you need a current view of commercial customers based on the previous business day, at the customer level, their CCID (commercial customer ID), some data related to that at the company/business level, delivered daily to a brand new Excel file which will live in a shared folder where another team can access it. Where it's not clear, is what level of data you are looking for. If it's at the company/business level, you mentioned you only need one id per company, then what is unique about customers that you need? Dates? Their commercial  status? If at customer level, should it be customer, account level? I see two levels you are looking at that you need to resolve, commercial customer (id), and individuals associated with that id. Look for maybe a relationship code in the source that has individuals, there may be a single individual with a primary relationship you can filter on, without knowing more, it would be difficult for anyone to help you with your join issues. It will be way easier to figure it out if you can import all that data into some kind of structured database environment, and pandas can emulate that.",

Perhaps different to where you are in the world, although realistically speaking you better be pretty fucking good and experienced if you're going to demand contracting rates which are typically quite high for an engineer.  For example, I have a friend who contracts for a big pharma company in a Senior position managing clinical trials.  I have looked at day rates for a standard DE role here in the UK.  Our rates are not a million miles off each other given the gulf in responsibility and impact.\n\nAside from that, this requires a mindset shift.  As somebody who was self taught, I had the same problem of trying to measure myself and going down the very dark hole of asking, \"what jobs am I good enough for?\" which eventually devolved to \"will I ever be good enough?\".\n\nThe cycle is this - you apply for jobs.  You get nothing back - you go away and improve your existing code, take another look at your CV/resume, you continue learning.  You get something back, your profile and the job market conditions are in the right place.  You keep repeating until you get something back.\n\nThere are no secrets, hacks, or shortcuts.  It's just a case of staying in the race long enough until you get your chance.",

So I’d say most important is what you bring to the role, good attitude, energy and an openness to learning and developing skills. \n\nLike mentioned before, be proactive in understanding how the product or application (s) you are working on really works. Sketch the data pipelines, the tech stack and how they fit in together. Talk to seniors when you have questions. Identify areas that are bottlenecks, have legacy systems and that can be improved. Try not to change large blocks, but find small things you can improve. This will give you confidence to do bigger things. \n\nReading books and doing courses are okay, but you learn most by solving real problems. So always focus on finding problems and solving them. \n\nWish you the best!",

Cloud based OCR APIs from Azure, AWS, Google.  All can be set up securely and are 10-100x cheaper than LLMs.\n3. Find the right tool.  Look into successors of LayoutLM specifically built for charts.

This way, Glue handles ETL, and Athena is used for querying, avoiding the unsupported pattern of executing Athena queries from Glue.",

This is actually a recommended approach when you need to split data from a single collection into multiple destination tables.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. First, you need to define logical partitions in your collection by specifying one or more fields as partition keys:\n\n```\ncollections:\n  acmeCo/user-sessions:\n    schema: session.schema.yaml\n    key: [/user/id, /timestamp]\n    projections:\n      country:\n        location: /country\n        partition: true\n      device:\n        location: /agent/type\n        partition: true\n      network:\n        location: /agent/network\n        partition: true\n```\n\n2. Then, in your materialization, you can use partition selectors to direct specific partitions to different tables:\n\n```\nmaterializations:\n  acmeCo/example/database-views:\n    endpoint: ...\n    bindings:\n      - source:\n          name: acmeCo/anvil/orders\n          partitions:\n            include:\n              customer: [Coyote]\n        resource: { table: coyote_orders }\n```",

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery.  I'd recommend looking up some videos which will explain this much better than I can.  Take a look at some blog post etc. just generally get a few viewpoints and explanations as to what it is.\n\nGenerally, you develop code for your application locally and then it runs somewhere else on a schedule.  So, you have to get your code over to the location where it runs.  The process for most workflows is develop on your machine -> push to a branch/repo -> submit pull request to main -> deploy to where it runs.  This is a CI/CD process.\n\nTo avoid it getting too complicated, your CI/CD process is likely going to be as simple as branching off main -> making changes -> pushing to your remote branch -> pull to main -> auto publishing main -> schedule application via Github actions.\n\nThis is assuming you're familiar with git and source control.  If not, this is a great opportunity to learn.",

I'm not sure what exactly *the* small files problem is or what *your* problem is in particular, but if you're looking to, say, keep only the latest values based on some key across multiple files, you have a few options.\n\nOne option is as I described: compaction. Go across your files and grab only the most recent data you want/need, merge into a new file, discard the old ones. Whether you want to implement this and how kinda depends on your exact data needs, so it's hard to say. At the very latest, I'd do this before archiving any data.\n\nThe other is to just track all changes in the data in your silver layer and grab the latest value. It's not really solving the small files problem though. Worst case scenario is just appending the files into a large file and keeping track of the file from which it came (or timestamp, whichever is more important).",

It is not uncommon for people in the WP ecosystem to think that the basic (and often horrible) things they do in their plugin development amount to all there is to programming, or that they don't need to learn more \"because it works\". I applaud you for recognizing that there is much more to learn. If you keep it up, you will go far! What I am referring to is:\n\n> My skills in programming tripled in size, but of course I gained no experience in testing, reviewing and stuff.\n\n> The big change is that I discovered AI. Whenever I get stuck I use it, but over time I have become too dependent on it. My skills became worse than ever. I still pass my exams, where AI is not allowed, but I can feel my knowledge fading. It feels like I have lost years of experience and become a beginner again.\n\n> There is a guy in my class who never uses AI and I am jealous.\n\nSo. All great insight. The good news: You can quickly get your \"lost\" experience back up, once you force yourself to think more for yourself, or change the way you use AI tooling. If you are going to use it, don't let it write code for you in your source code. Rather ask it questions and analyze the approaches it comes up with. Then carefully consider, whether the approach fits your project.",

        "body": "I think it might be a little bit of a misunderstanding to hear different programmers experiences about their work hours and relate that to their efficiency as a programmer. Some of us are working on legacy systems that are so vast and full of engineering debt that we could never hope to make more than small changes at a time, lest we cripple an entire business model in some catastrophic way. And sometimes the expectations of the work environment dramatically shift leaving programmers with much more to do. Environment has everything to do with it. Programmers who are first in line at a start-up building brand new products from scratch are going to go blazing fast, while those working in enterprises with bureaucracy and existing customers will need to move much more purposefully. Finally, you have to consider that different programmers will target different career velocity.\n\nWith that out of the way I also have an answer to the specific question about productivity.\n\n**Become a master of your debugging tools**\n\nKnowing how to use breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, logging services and query languages for interpreting your logs is critical. If you're operating live services you probably also want to start picking up the ability to analyze and understand crash dumps and memory dumps. The difference in velocity between a developer who can do these things, and one who can't is immense.\n\n**Find the true requirements**\n\nDon't trust your managers, PM's, or customers to be able to convey what needs to be done. Communication is the hardest part of the whole job and it's everyone's responsibility to be engaged and active in the conversation. That means you are speaking up, asking questions, understanding the why and how. When appropriate, suggest alternate solutions that make more sense than what comes out of the requirements machine. You'll save yourself a huge headache and a lot of time over massaging semi-correct requirements to be a functional product.\n\n**Code isn't always the answer**\n\nTo a hammer every problem is a nail, and to a programmer every solution is code. But what makes a really great developer is getting out of the IDE every once in a while and getting a birds-eye view on the whole operation. There are mountains of tools available to us that aren't code for solving problems. It's all programming at the end of the day, just with different primitives. But if you can meet a business requirement with a $20 off the shelf solution that already exists... define a process that eliminates your requirement at no cost, or hook up some existing set of systems in such a way that you solve what would otherwise have been a large problem with little to no code that's a big win.\n\nRemember, every line of code you write needs to be tested. Kept up to date with changing requirements and compliance demands. Maintained for the lifetime of the product. Code is expensive.\n\n**Cut out the distractions**\n\nYeah, I know, you work better while listening to youtube and passively grinding your firemaking cape isn't really that much of an attention suck. You're still getting work done. But... how about just doing those things later because regardless about how you *feel* about your distractions impact, they are slowing you down. Humans aren't particularly good at multi-tasking. And while you might be moving forward, you won't know what things you wouldn't have missed without the distraction. I listen to music without lyrics while I code, that's my personal compromise. Over the long term of many years examining myself it's evident that I'll be less productive with anything more engaging than that in front of me.\n\n**Collaborate**\n\nI wish I saw more of this. Especially in a world where many of us are working remotely, or in isolated cubical/office spaces. All of the things I've described above are easier to do when you don't do them alone. Get a teammate who's on the same page as you in terms of increasing velocity by taking your work seriously and then do it together. Sit side by side and engage in coding 'sprints' where you push for continuous progress for 20 minute periods at a time. Then rest, then repeat. Have pair programming blocks, where you work together on the same problem for an hour. Give space for 'state of the code' discussions where you just talk about what engineering problems you're encountering, and what choices or projects might change things to improve the engineering environment.\n\n**Take breaks**\n\nAfter so many hours of cranking out solutions, you'll get fatigued and slow. I remember grinding in school, getting stuck and getting frustrated near the deadline for a project. I'd spend 4 hours making meaningful progress, and then 8 just being confused, tired, and frustrated. Only to get 6 hours of sleep, wake up in the morning and look at my project and suddenly it was all clear. Take your breaks. Eat regular meals. Get exercise. Be well. When you're in a healthy state your brain will function better.",

        "body": "It looks like most answers here are talking about programming-specific reasons, but here are examples where even non-programmers, and you too, 'naturally' start with zero:\n\nWhen someone is born, they are 0 years old. Their \"first\" year of life all takes place while they are '0' years old. Interestingly, there are some cultures that start *this* indexing from 1, e.g. in traditional chinese age counting, a baby is 1 when they are born. Even then though, you can generalize this to other time periods. A person's first 'decade' of life all takes place while they are 0 decades old. This is the same reason why we are living in the \"21st\" century even though the year begins with \"20\" and not \"21\". (Although note there's some annoying aspects of the definition of this type of 'century').\n\nIn many buildings throughout the world, the \"1\" floor of the building is the one above the ground floor. More rarely, although I've seen it, the ground floor may even be labelled the '0' floor. I suspect this probably has other reasoning behind it, but it's at least tangentially related. Here's some simple reasoning for why counting floors like this works and might even help you to see what's \"nice\" about zero indexing in the first place. The ground floor is \"0\" floors above the ground. The second floor (labelled 1) is 1 floor above the ground. And so on, the nth floor is labelled n-1 and it is n-1 floors above the ground.\n\n(Side note: This \"number of floors offset from the ground\" idea is how arrays are implemented in C and many other programming languages. The first element has offset 0 to the 'start' of the array, the second has offset 1, and so on. So the reasoning and math lines up exactly with this floor offset stuff).\n\nHere is some mathematical reasoning for why such indexing is nice. Let's say you have 100 people and you want to split them into groups of 10 each. You could label them 1 to 100 and then split up the groups so that people labelled 1 through 10 are in the first group, 11 through 20 in the second, and so on. However, there is a nice property that you are *almost* able to exploit here... What if everyone in the first group has a \"0\" as their tens digit, everyone in the second has a \"1\" in their tens digit, and so on? We can't do this because the first group has the person labelled 10, the second has the person labelled 20, and so on. You *could* get this nice labelling if you instead labelled everyone from 0 to 99, so the first group is people labelled 0 through 9, second is 10 through 19, and so on.\n\nIt might seem like the example above is contrived (and it does work 'extra nicely' cuz I chose 100 and we use a base 10 numbering system), but you can generalize it as follows. Say you have n people (and n is divisible by p) and you want to split them into p groups. Say that n = p \\* q, so that each group has q people in it. Then, if you label these people from 0 to n-1, you could ask each person labelled i to find the result of i / q (truncated), and that gives them the \"group index\" they are in. So group 0 would be for people that are labelled 0 through q-1, group 1 would be for people labelled q through 2\\*q -1, and so on. We wouldn't get this nice scheme if we labelled our people from 1 to n (in fact, we would then have use the equation (i-1) / q, which is effectively re-labelling our people with zero indexing!) Another interesting thing to note here is that not only does this setup work nicely with zero indexing, but it also naturally *results* in a zero-indexed group numbering system.\n\nThe above example is related to why, when working in modular arithmetic, let's say the integers mod N, the 'canonical' form of the elements is usually considered to be from 0 through N-1. When you start to learn more algorithms, you'll see that many algorithms will work nicer or the algebra may be neater if we use zero indexing. (Note that there definitely are algorithms which work nicer with 1-indexing too, so this is more anecdotal than anything, but I think it'll still give you a feeling for why zero indexing is nice). The last example also relates to why using half open intervals i.e. \\[0, N), is such a common paradigm in programming (for example, a python range includes the 'start' but excludes the 'stop'). The 'niceness' of using half-open intervals (which may also seem strange at first) is somewhat related to the 'niceness' of using zero indexing.\n\nI'm sure there's more such examples, but hopefully this answers your question in a more broad sense, and you see that 'indexing by zero' is not just limited to programming, and, perhaps unintuitively, feels more 'natural' when you think about it.",

Way back, programmers were trying to make use of every bit they could because so little memory was available. This is the reason for two year dates and the Y2K problem. Back at the time, programmers thought \"Hey, that's two whole bytes I could use somewhere else that could actually be useful.\" I think starting from the first available byte value, instead of skipping it, appeals to that tradition as much as it's just natural to do.",

What actually keeps you moving is discipline and consistency. Make a schedule, stick to it, and just keep showing up.\n\nHere’s the thing: once you stop, it’s surprisingly hard to come back — even if you used to love coding or learning before. That’s why it’s so important to stay connected, even on low-energy days. Watch a CS video, read an article, or just mess with some code. The longer you’re away, the bigger the gap gets, and the harder it is to return, so you need to do something no matter however small that might be. For God sake even just opening vs code & browsing through the code for couple of min also counts.\nAlso,  a little arrogance is actually useful. Not just belief in yourself, but that competitive arrogance of “I want to be better than others.” When everything else feels low, that pride can keep you grinding. And don’t underestimate daydreaming. Imagine what you’ll be once you finish this project or learn that new concept. Sure, it’s mental masturbation, but it feeds your feedback loop and keeps the fire alive.\n\nAll these factors — discipline, arrogance, dreaming, consistency — they don’t always burn equally strong. Sometimes one carries you, sometimes another. But they only start working for you once you actually start and keep going. You might feel like some of these things don't apply to you but they will in their due time when you are at it.",

You don't need to collect languages. They come and go (from your mind) easily. What does \"finished C\" and \"doing C++\" mean to you? You learn the syntax and semantics of a language to *use* it. If you've put effort into learning some C, you should write some software in it. You'll retain very little unless you do. It doesn't make much sense to memorise a bunch of things about a language that you then abandon, just to repeat that with the next one, and so on...\n\nAs for C++, what are you planning on doing with it and why can't you do it in C to cement your existing knowledge? If you wanted to learn C++ you could have learned the modern flavour without C first, though it won't do you any harm and there's plenty of transfer between the two (as much as some don't like to admit it).\n\nIn summary, forget your rule, slow down, choose what you learn in a targeted manner, and commit to using it for a while to test your understanding and make it stick.",

C has a variety of uses, one of which is that a few of the textbooks I'm interested in working through use C.  Another important reason for learning C is that it forces a programmer to think more \"lower level\" than other programming languages, and learning how a program interacts with an operating system to use hardware is a useful thing for programmers to learn.  Not essential, I believe, but useful.  I intend to learn C++ after, because I like that C++ is object oriented, and I'm also interested in competitive programming.\n\nAs far as you 80/20 rule, I think the way you described it sounds fishy.  Just like there is no royal road to geometry, there is no royal road to learning a computer programming language.  With that being said, I've heard people claim something along the lines of 80 percent of the total work done by a system is done by 20 percent of that system.  But the validity and applicability of a particular philosophy is not the point of this post.  I think a good, small(ish) collection of problems for either C or C++ can be found in the first chapter of Kernighan and Ritchie's book The C Programming Language.  The first chapter is a whirlwind tour of C, and there are about 25 exercises in it that covers enough of the language that the authors claim, and I'm paraphrasing, to get a programmer up and running in C.  Sounds like what you're interested in.  C++ is not C, but I suspect that you might be able to use C++ for those problems as well and get some similar out of it.  \n\nHope that helps.",

You might even find you enjoy tinkering.\n\nAlways try and do MORE than what the Labs ask. Lab might say do \"X\" and maybe you are finished with a week or so left? Spend that time refining it. Play around, get creative. Goldplate it (which means do extra). This happens in the real world, we refine our code (or iteration).\n\nDo PROJECTS. Focus on your Git skills. Learn topics not studied in classes. You have no idea how many new grads we get who don't even now how to merge or what rebase means which leads us to declining them.\n\nWork with friends on silly projects. Silly little projects lead to exponential gains as you learn from each other. Do code reviews of each others Labs. Maybe Dave knows something Bob doesn't, so Dave can let Bob know of this and now Bob knows this and he can pass that knowledge onto others. This way you learn of branching, merging, rebasing and the rest to keep your branches up to date with others.\n\nYou can make friends with your teachers, because guess what? They were just like you. You never know what kind of insight they can give you.\n\nAlways ask questions. Something doesn't make sense? Who cares if its a silly question, you are PAYING to be there.\n\nFor reference:\n\nWhen I was in school, I took 7 classes a semester and still practice coding 2-3hrs a night. It seems like a lot, 2-3hrs? \"are you kidding?!\" No. 2-3hrs is so small, you might not even get any code written while you are learning how to, for example: API REST points for a silly CRUD app.\n\nMy friend group which was roughly \\~7 of us, all code reviewed each other, would hang out in Skype (oh god I'm old) and just do silly little things. We would all work on projects (not all 7 at the same time) and we would knit pick each other, say \"man this is stupid, do it this way\".\n\nNot only will you make friends, you are all uplifting each other, and you will all succeed because that group work is more beneficial in skill than working on a Lab in your class.\n\nBUT MOST OF ALL?\n\nHave fun.

You have class time, homework, and that's pretty much it. If you have questions, you ask in class.\n\nUniversities are different. Professors and TAs offer office hours, and you really, really should take advantage of them. Do the homework, go discuss it in office hours to just see what they say. Most of the time, the person having office hours will be completely alone and you won't be interrupting anyone else's time, because *no one seems to do this*. \n\nI took a graduate level Computability and Complexity class in my senior year. Another student and I learned the professor liked latte's. We'd buy him one and go to every single office hour he offered. We'd talk to him about the class, get extra help and insight into the material, and it was absolutely critical. Without that I would've failed the class, but I ended up getting an A.\n\nAnyway, that's just general college advice. For CS specifically, I'd say find the things you're interested in, whatever you're passionate about, and pursue those in classes if they're offered, and if not, find professors who can point you in the right direction (again, office hours!) to help you pursue them as side projects. \n\nI wouldn't worry about trying to learn as many languages as you can. Pick like two or three and learn them really well. Something systems level like C/C++/Rust, something very high level like Python, and something like Java/Go/C#/some other garbage collected but very productive language.  \n\nOne of the best things I did was to become a grader. It was sort of like a TA position, but we just graded projects and held office hours, we didn't teach classes. If something like that is available, I'd highly encourage doing it. It's one thing to learn how to debug your own code. Learning how to work through 30 other people's code? That's an irreplaceable experience. I mean I was paid to learn how to read and evaluate other people's code, and that is such an important skill. It's something they don't really tell you will be important, but when you're working in an existing codebase and with other people who are also contributing to it, you'll need to not only be able to write your own new code, but also to read other code that someone else wrote (and also your own 2 to 5 to 10 years later when you're a completely different person).",

Martin.** Strengths: an excellent guide to writing code that is readable, maintainable, changeable, and testable; includes tons of examples, so instead of getting just a list of \"rules\" to follow, you get to see how to iteratively improve code, step by step. Weaknesses: has taken a lot of flak recently for some of the recommendations (e.g., very short functions), or perhaps due to hate for the author (who admittedly can be off putting), but I still think it's well-worth reading for all programmers; focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming.\n\n* **_A Philosophy of Software Design_ by John Ousterhout.** Strengths: does a good job of defining complexity in software and the key causes of it; good discussions of information hiding, error handling, and conventions; contains some interesting counter-arguments to the practices in _Clean Code_, so it's good to read the books side-by-side. Weaknesses: focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming; the discussions of strategy vs tactics and trends felt a bit weak.\n\n* **_Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests_ by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.** Strengths: the best book I've seen on teaching you how to write automated tests; makes a compelling argument for how tests lead to better software design; includes many examples, and shows you how to use tests to iteratively produce better code. Weaknesses: the book focuses entirely on Java and OO, so yet again, functional programming is ignored; the book can get boring at times when it gets deep into the weeds of the Java Swing threading model.\n\n* **_Seven Languages in Seven Weeks_ by Bruce A. Tate.** Strengths: a fantastic way to get exposure to not only multiple different programming languages (Ruby, Haskell, Prolog, Io, Erlang, Clojure, Scala), but also multiple different programming paradigms (OO, functional programming, logic programming, meta programming, concurrency constructs, type systems), which is a terrific way to become a better programmer; lots of great exercises in the book that give you a taste of what makes each language and paradigm unique. Weaknesses: it's hard to be an expert in so many different languages, so some of the chapters are stronger than others.",

You end up picking a few things and trying those out first, then slowly add other ideas. \n\nYour priority should be readability first, then maybe make it efficient. Why? Some beginners (more true 30-40 years ago) believe the most efficient code is the best code. Maybe when computers were slow, this was important, but today, it's far less important.\n\nAlso, unless it's an algorithmic improvement, most programmers don't know what is causing their code to be inefficient. They make a guess, and hope that it works, but often, they can't tell a difference. The code runs fast to begin with and whatever fraction faster it runs is not even noticeable.\n\nSo, readability first. You may think coding is for computers, but it's also for humans. When you opt to make things run fast or use less memory, then you write code that's harder to read. Others will find your code confusing.\n\nMy advice is to learn how to write good function and variable names. This is not at all easy. But good names act as documentation. Many developers are lazy when it comes to documentation. They find it a waste of time. At the very least, getting good function/variable names does improve readability.\n\nYou can see beginners opting to pick variable names like `x, y, z` because they struggle to come up with good names.\n\nThere's this idea that functions are meant to reuse code. That's true, but it can also be used as a kind of documentation.\n\nFor example, I encountered something similar to the following:\n\n    code == 10 || code == 12 || code == 30\n\nLet's say these codes indicate someone is tax-exempt internally in the database. They serve as a classification of the person's status, and numbers are used to be precise.\n\nIt would read better as\n\n       boolean hasTaxExemptStatus(int taxCode) {\n          return taxCode == 10 || taxCode == 12 \n                   || taxCode == 30;\n      }\n\nEven if you only call that function once, it makes it clearer. I was originally going to call this `isTaxExempt`, but I renamed it to `hasTaxExemptStatus` because that felt more accurate to me.\n\nThe other common tip is: DRY. Don't Repeat Yourself.\n\nIf you see yourself copying-pasting the same code over and over, then make it into a function and refactor all of that code.\n\nThere are other more sophisticated tips, but I'd say start with those two.",

The difference is just what you need it for. The biggest thing you need to get comfortable doing is breaking things down into smaller steps. Say you've got a project in mind, something simple like making a little calculator app with HTML and JavaScript. Maybe you don't know how to do this at all. Well, how do you break that down? You need a webpage with buttons and display, and you need some JaveScript to do some work for you. So, how do you make a webpage? You can look that up. See what HTML is and how to use it. Then you can design a really simple looking calculator. How do you get javascript running on a web page? Look it up. It's simple, but you won't know without looking it up first. Then, how do you get javascript to know when you press something? How do you get javascript to change the display somewhere? You can look these up, and suddenly you know what you need to make the app. Now it's just a matter of making some simple functions to do your calculator's math and you've got something you can be proud of.\n\n  \nThe trick is, look up how to do the concept, not the specifics. So, don't look up \"JS how to add 3 + 5\", look up \"JS how to add two numbers.\" Then apply it to your situation. You get a little thinking involved, and you get a little better. Keep at it and it won't be too long before that kind of stuff is easy and you're struggling with harder things. And APIs? You'll always have to look those up. Not because you won't understand them, but because the specifics are always unique to whatever you're doing.",

Most projects require (or are made significantly easier) by using libraries. I start by looking up what is available, because that gives me an idea both about the problem, and about how people normally go about solving it. \n\n2. Documentation. When I have decided for a library to start with, I go over it's documentation. I specifically look for setup and \"first steps\", but everything that seems remotely interesting I will take a quick glance at. \n\n3. Forums, Blog Posts, Stackoverflow. At this stage I will probably have some questions, so I look for people who have either had the same questions and found answers, or I will look for blog posts trying to explain it. This is the only stage where I sometimes use AI, but very very rarely. I have gotten pretty good at getting to the answers with classical search engines, and getting the answers that way is normally better, since I stumble upon a lot of other information that might prove useful later.   \nAnother important skill is to find good blog posts. I blocked [medium.com](http://medium.com) completely in my browser, since it's just 95% time wasting blogs that copy and paste directly from the documentation in order to farm clicks. Self hosted blogs, especially those with a long history of similar topics, are the best. Reddit ranks somewhere in the middle. \n\nAnd the most interesting links get bookmarked and downloaded for offline viewing, especially all documentation I need. There will never be a stage where you know all of this by heart, the best thing you can do is make sure you keep access to it, even without the internet, and you should know where the information you need is located.",

I work for a company with a hundred employees and I handle all of their software whereas half of it is custom. \n\nThis is my process. \nAfter interviewing employees who would be the end user of my program, I draw up a rough draft of what the program would look like and how the program flow would go. I used to draw up screens right in visuals studio but I found it to be much quicker and easier to do screen layouts in Draw.IO\n\nI would go back to the end users with the screen layouts and talk about the flow of the program just to be sure that we were all even mildly on the same page. \n\nAfter revisions I would then start seriously thinking about the program. I would always start with the parts of the program that I think would give me the most trouble and I would create proofs of concept. I could spend days on Google on this alone depending on the complexity of what I want to do. I think that I overthink the right way to do certain tasks where I could just settle on one way but I want to know what really is the best way.\n\nAt this point, most of the OOB visual studio libraries should be easy to handle and I consider myself somewhat of an SQL expert so those things are no big problem for me and I have a pretty strong code library from stuff I've done in the past. \n\nDuring this proof of concept phase, I end up writing wrappers for APIs or drivers or libraries that I've never used before. I don't just write the wrappers for the specific application that I'm writing, I write them as if I would be using them in other applications because I probably will. \n\nI have a whole repository of these little c sharp proofs of concepts and a lot of them were never used. I use Google, I use AI, whatever it takes to get me there. When I use AI I don't just copy paste and move on, I play with it until I fully understand it. \n\nOnce I get all my proofs of concepts together and a better understanding of how all these parts will come together, I write up a spec and I get somebody to sign off on it. The spec is boring as hell so they won't actually read it but they will sign off on it. I always do a teams with them so it's not like I didn't explain it to them. \n\nAt this point I put together some sample data that will work with the app without any issues and I begin writing the application. \n\nOnce the application can run through sample data without errors, I will go over it again with the person who signed off on it. I take notes on their critique and make adjustments to the spec and continue coding. During this final phase, I add more data. I also introduced bad data and I intentionally try to break the program with bad data or steps out of order. I try to handle as many known errors as possible and try to graciously exit out of unhandled errors so as not to end up with corrupt records or files.\n\nMost of the time I go right to production but a lot of times I only release to a few testers and I dedicate a day to just doing minor updates.\n\nSo, I usually use Google or AI just to get through the proof of concept phase, but I'm not going to lie, I do use it to write code that would just be otherwise tedious to do by hand. Like I said, I do a lot of SQL and for tables with a lot of columns it's just tedious to write a datagridview in c sharp. With chat GPT I could take a spreadsheet of sample data and ask chat to write a script that creates a SQL table and import the data of the sheet and then write a datagridview to hold that data. Chat figures out the data types based on the field names and I only have to make minor corrections or ask chat to correct them for me.",

Use AI, start liking it, it is future and the sooner you hop on, the easier it gets.  \n3. Try , try , try ,try ,try ,try ,try and after that repeat. All you have to do is try , problem is that people will be burn out easly. You can do some interactive youtube videos where you work more than listen.  \n4. Give yourself some goal, some smaller on for begining and find what you need, for example you mentioned games:  \nIdea - rock paper scissors game  \nPlan - some simple 2d models of hands showing rock paper and scissors  \nStart - Find some good language for that. You can do it by youserlf, or type it to google or even better to AI, after you winth a language for that (or some tool like unity) You will need menu, again do what you can and if you are missing some crucial steps (like you dont know how to border text or etc) just use google. \n\nI mean using AI is simple way, but googling everything by yourself will teach you more.",

Programming has certainly become a frontier extremely difficult to navigate these days— especially with the advent of AI.   \nThe only sure way to learn programming— and take my advice —is to try out open-source programs.   \nWhen I mean trying out, I don’t mean only to use it, but also to download the source code and compile it yourself. Study the code in a Sensible manner, and augment it, or see how far can possibly augment the code without breaking.   \nDocumentation Is very important, but let me tell you an Industrial-secret: \\[nobody, not even the guys who created Assembly-language itself know entirely what they are doing— nobody has the perfect idea atleast\\].   \nWhat does this mean? Trial and Error. And only by using this method, can you fully accomplish learning Industrial methods of engineering software.   \nYou may have noticed a sinister pattern. There is a broad Inequality in the spectrum of projects covered in courses and tutorials offered on the internet. Even then, they are often too basic and fall behind industrial specifications.   \nEven then, open-source softwares lag somewhat in certain areas, compared to the truly Industrial softwares produced by og Software-devs at the beginning of the Digital Age. This is because— and undeniably so — the best software is hidden behind  a pay-wall, and rightly so. \n\nSo, while dabbling with open-source is an excellent way of updating your learning, it also isn’t enough. But I wouldn’t recommend the ‘Grass-roots’ approach to programing— it’s just impossible. You need vast amount of people-hours to construct even most basic programs. Libraries develop, sure. But they are often by-products of designs intended for specific projects. This, in the end adds up to the inefficiency of the entire system. That is why, companies at-times resort to constructing their projects from as further back as possible— ie. CPU architectures. This is perhaps the best way to increase efficiency.   \nWhat does this mean for you? It means, that using Libraries aren’t as good as making libraries.   \nTo sum up everything I said in a way beneficial to you: begin by using and testing open-source software; don’t become Frustrated knowing that you can’t make a software like ‘TempleOS’. Making an excellent and efficient software is as difficult as building the pyramids. You need large man-hours. \n\nSpeaking of TempleOS. I am sure even Terry, the creator of TempleOS, understands how he was limited by the hardware— which was obviously impossible even for him.   \nI say that, because people pretend as if it is the most efficient software ever written— it isn’t.",

(I joke, I like Rust overall).\n\nOnce you get into writing things the Rust way (TM?) you get to worry less (but not forget about completely) memory bugs that can cause crashes or be exploited. The benefits are many and varied. Rust also has a nice type system if you're into that, and nice language-level support for tagged/discriminated unions, and matching. If you're into function style/idioms, you'll feel at home, but if you're used to OOP there's plenty to recognise too, e.g. struct/impl/traits. I've often said my ideal general purpose HLL would be a cross between C and Rust (yes, I know about Zig and Odin), because I like both but find Rust annoying to write (especially when code involves lots of explicit lifetime annotation) and visually quite information-dense (IMO).\n\nI much prefer C, me/my teams rarely have most of the issues that the Rust compiler guards against, but nobody who likes Rust believes you when you say that :) I like to configure debug and release builds from the get go, and use the sanitisers (address etc.) in debug always. I have a big list of flags I use for compilation config built up over the years. LSPs and a parser (e.g. treesitter) catch some typos (e.g. . instead of -> or missing a \\*/& etc.) too.\n\nRust has no bearing on your Azure cert AFAIK, and to be honest it hasn't seen massive uptake commercially (yet?). I know lots of businesses (previous employers or places friends work) that are still using C and/or C++ with no interest even in committing to writing new software in Rust, let alone rewriting anything existing, anecdotally. I say this to say that the Rust job market isn't what it is for other languages (e.g. your C#, Java, others like JS and Python) which are seeing lots of use in recent years.\n\nThere are also better languages if you want to learn how to manage memory freely, as Rust enforces it's particular model.\n\nTLDR; Learn Rust because you want to. Don't if you don't. You aren't disadvantaging yourself by not learning it, and it's fairly easily picked up if need be once you've been programming a while. It can be used to write fast, robust native software. I use ripgrep, fd, every day.",

        "body": "general rule of thumb is older languages are harder to learn, because they abstract less away from you. you can start with BASIC, or assembly, or python, or C or basically any language. And eventually, you will have to learn most concepts anyway (you will find along the way that languages all have a lot in common). If your end goal is making games for a console, it's not going to be an issue at all to start in those languages. To directly answer your question, i would advise picking an ergonomic language to let you focus on learning the fundamentals instead of fighting the quirks of the language. Relative to BASIC or assembly, C will feel much easier",

You can look into libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or even simple transformers for beginner chatbots. Robotics also leans on Python (with frameworks like ROS).\n\nMy advice: Pick one area to focus on first (web or AI/robotics) so you don’t get overwhelmed. For videos:\n• FreeCodeCamp’s full-stack web tutorials (React + Node)\n• Sentdex’s Python/AI tutorials on YouTube\n• Corey Schafer for Python deep dives.\n\nYou don’t have to “choose perfectly” right now — just follow what excites you most and you’ll naturally pick up skills that transfer across areas.",

The first is to write a test harness that, once it passes, then you know the task is done.\n\nLike today I was stuck trying to build this new user story and ended up just making a really long cypress test that setup the environment to where the feature was relevant and walked through all the necessary steps. It failed (of course) but it failed quickly and showed the exact spot where it was failing so I could keep changing something, run the test, change something, run the test until it could run all the way through.\n\nI think that solves one cause of this which is constantly trying to remember how to get to the spot where the thing you’re working on pops up.\n\nAnother cause is when I have to make something that involves several layers of abstraction. For that I like starting on one end and just sprinkling assert statements with detailed messages as I go. That way I don’t end up with a spaghetti mess of code that I’m trying to fix across several files.\n\nHope that helps :)",

You contribute to open source because you've got expertise worth contributing. You don't have to be an expert, but a beginner is unlikely to be able to even understand the codebase and the outstanding issues well enough to make useful contributions.\n\nPeople will sometimes highlight \"this would be a good issue to work on for a beginner\" but they don't mean a beginner programmer - they mean an experienced programmer who is new to that open source project or even new to open source in general.

Here's my suggestions for what's been helping me.\n\n\nFirst start your own open source project. Work on a project you want to build, but look up the work flow and follow a basic structure large repos might use and make a CONTRIBUTING file based on some real ones from other projects. You can use it to learn forking, how do write an issue, how to write a PR, how to merge commits. When you're doing it make sure you write everything like you're writing it for someone else and tag any really easy things with good first issue. These will often get picked up by others. Then you'll get a chance to see the basics of what maintainers are looking for in other people's code, and you'll get experience with light collaboration with others. \n\n\n\n\nAfter doing this for a while you'll feel way more confident in how to contribute. Then you just have to find issues that are within your scope. That's easier said than done, but I'd look for medium sized projects that aren't as well know. At that point you'll have some experience and you can look to helping out in larger and larger projects.\n\n\n\n\nIt's not a fast process, but I've found it rewarding so far.",

Not quite as widely available as php. \n\nSneering at languages is something that amuses “sophomore” (wise fool) developers. It’s silly.",

And in this space, PHP is still a powerhouse. From WordPress, Magento, Drupal, Laravel, Symfony, and countless premium solutions, PHP continues to fuel a massive chunk of the internet.\n\nThat said, the current tech landscape is evolving. The spotlight today is on scalable, secure frontends, and that’s where JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Knockout dominate. Add to that the industry’s move toward headless architecture and microservices, and you’ll see why frontend innovation is driving a lot of excitement.\n\nMeanwhile, Python has carved its own path. Thanks to the AI/ML revolution, it’s become the go-to language for data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The beauty? If you know Python, you’re not limited—you can work on AI/ML and build web applications too.\n\nIn short: PHP isn’t going anywhere, but the battlefield has expanded. The future belongs to those who can adapt across ecosystems—whether that’s PHP, JS frameworks, or Python.",

I think you can build a lot, not actually knowing the language; just good at googling / LLMs. Data structures and algos really cement the language into memory (for me)\n\nThat said, there are set and queue problems in the easy section and I don't think anyone thinks those aren't important to know.\n\nThe algo questions abstract the product so when you can see a problem in a product and know -- \"oh its crashing cause I'm firing off 10,000 requests at one time\" lets use an **async queue** to guarantee the app is only firing ... 100? at a time, waiting for that to finish the firing off the next 100 (async queue)\n\nOnce you have a really large user base where everyone is sharing resources and theres a webhook telling me to make a request every-time someone updates something --- you want to prepare for the worst case scenario where everyone updates the thing at once, and it ends up being like 10 lines of code.\n\nIMO practicing data structures and algos gives me a major leg up when interviewing, or solving a problems and working or not, I always keep a problem going on in the back of my head.",

Good times!\n\nIt depends what interests you. I started with C++, which was good because it's one of the most popular and well-supported languages there is, but it's relatively hard to get into. That was ok for me though, because I liked the challenge and learn how things worked under the hood, like how computers manage memory with pointers and all that.\n\nToday I program mostly C# and it's a fantastic language that's quite easy to pick up and very powerful. You can also use it for Unity or Godot game engine.\n\nYou can pick Java too which is very similar to C#, but I like it slightly less for some reason.\n\nPython I usually advise against as a first language, because of its dynamic typing and you might learn some things you may have to unlearn later on. On the plus side, Python is very good to know for prototyping and automation and it's very popular and you should definitely learn it at some point. I think it will be the most similar one to Lua, so if you want to try something a little more challenging and new, maybe pick something else.\n\nDefinitely dm me if you would like to chat or would like a code review or something.",

Most companies will have designers who create mockups/wireframes for you to implement. You won't usually be designing from scratch unless you're at a tiny startup where everyone wears 10 hats. Your job would be taking those designs and turning them into actual working code.\n\nThe fact that you've got CSS, HTML and most of JS down is solid. Frontend is way more forgiving when you're learning because you can actually see what you're building instead of staring at terminal outputs all day.\n\nAt Metana we see students make this exact transition all the time. Backend concepts like databases, server architecture, APIs etc can be overwhelming at first but frontend lets you build confidence with visual feedback. Plus the job market for frontend is pretty decent right now.\n\nMy advice would be to pick one path and stick with it for now instead of jumping around. If styling feels more natural than wrestling with Express, go frontend. You can always learn backend later once you're comfortable with one side of things. The whole \"full stack\" thing sounds cool but honestly most people end up specializing anyway.\n\nAlso stop using Mimo and start building actual projects.

Some math maybe, but how deep do you really go?  \n  I had to take a lot of math, as an electrical engineering student.  I was slow to catch on, but I loved computer science.  Computer science is more than coding.  Trying to pull trig and algebra patterns out of your head to solve a calculus riddle is math I don't like.  But doing reductions of digital logic circuits using math algorithms was fun for me, and I did better some some people good a traditional math.    \n  Solving computer science homework/exam problems was hard for everybody, and I had my moments, but you have to picture in your head where you want to go, write it down in pictures, then you can conjure up the code to get there.   Well, at least for me.  Sometimes my code was called \"brute force\", but I didn't care, it worked and computers are large and fast these days.  \n\n  Sometimes  you have to take \"poetic license\" with the requirements of the problem to solve it.   I once had a class problem involving recursion.  It said each iteration had to spawn the next using the previous values.  The entire class literally had the method spin off another thread, until the computer cried out for mercy.   I just sent the values of the output back home to the main, made junk collection destroyed the method and recovered the resources, and created a new one, with the saved values.  Yeah, sound obvious to you now.  :)   The rest of the class thought I cheated.  The professor gave me a strange look, and said it was OK, probably because I had the only working solution.    Just solve the problem.  That means first map out how to get from here to there.  The coding actually becomes a bit relaxing until you reach compile time, and moment of truth.",

In this way, it is its own documentation; whenever you're unsure how your system would behave for a given set of inputs, your unit tests should clue you in, either through static analysis or by failing/succeeding.\n\nAs you point out, having tests gives you a level of security knowing that new changes don't introduce unexpected behaviors.\n\nWhat you say with regards to losing your \"feel\" for the code, that can happen and arguably is a \"feature\" of having excellent test coverage and architecture. If you're soloing a project by yourself, you might not see the immediate benefit. But if you work on an incredibly complex code base with multiple contributors, it's actually a great thing for you not to just rely on your feel. In the \"real world\", imagine you're pulled off a project and someone else takes your place. This person will have no \"feel\" and will rely on test coverage to ensure they're not breaking anything.\n\nAnd finally, from my experience, relying on tests hasn't necessarily diminished my feel for the code. I still know what it does and where it does it, but I have the extra validation that I have the test coverage needed to make changes.",

To a lot of us, the \"everyone else knows more and are better than me, how can I hope to keep up\" is just something our brain does that feels real but isn't, just like visual illusions and lots of other mistakes brains make. The feeling might even be mutual!\n1. My impression is that there seems to be something for programming that's similar to dyslexia or dyscalculia, as in, there seems to be some people who just don't get it, for reasons that appear incomprehensible to people who don't have the dysfunction. Having been an assistant in some courses, my impression is that it's very rare, but that there are some people who seem to get an experience that's a combination of [it goes in the square hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUbIkNUFs-4) (as the piece-tosser, and don't understand why the girl is upset) and [computer says no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0YGZPycMEU). I think it's unlikely that you'd last several years if that applied to you.\n1. There are several different types of programming environments, and what clicks for someone might not for another. As in, I have small experience with [LabView](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW) and don't want any more, but I have a friend who loves that and detests \"ordinary\" programming. Similarly, I find some languages like JS very hard to reason about because they're so … sloppy, and prefer rather strict languages; but there are plenty of people with the exact opposite preference. Finding out what _your_ preference is is also a key to feeling like you get it.",

So it would be the best language for a beginner to learn would be something like python. It introduces you to all of the basic programming concepts like loops control flow variables while obscuring away explicit memory management or data types. It is also quite good  at a lot of data processing work because of the intuitive way it handles lists so there is a big market for python devs. Once you get a decent understanding of programming concepts, then moving onto something like c or c++ may be a better idea because you won’t be fighting to develop a mental model of both high level and low level cs topics at the same time.",

        "body": "This sounds like an AI prompt, but whatever.\n\nFirst of all, I think there is a hidden contradiction in your question:\n\n>In your opinion, what would be the best programming language for someone to start learning as early as possible, and why?\n\n>“What matters more for a beginner: ease of entry, or long-term benefit?”\n\nIn the first question you asked what \"someone\" should do. In the second one you ask what a \"beginner\" should do. The term beginner suggests to me a person who is learning to play the piano. Learning programming is nothing like this. It is more like learning calculus. If you are trying to learn programming this way, I cannot advise you, because I don't believe you will succeed no matter which language you learn. So let's assume you are not a beginner.\n\nIf you are a scholar, I recommend that you learn LISP. Every language that is considered a \"scripting\" language owes everything in its feature set to LISP. If you complete all of the exercises in ANSI Common LISP by Paul Graham, you will understand most programming languages better than 90% of all programmers. It is kind of like learning Latin. After this, every language will be easy.\n\nIf you are an engineer, I recommend that you learn C. Every language that is considered a \"scripting\" language (and even most that are not) directly or indirectly calls the C standard library, and thus C. In fact, C has practically a one-to-one correspondence with assembly language, which means if you learn C, you can learn assembly and understand computer hardware quite easily. By extension, you will understand everything running on your system, even if you don't know all of the details of that particular language.\n\nIf you are neither an engineer nor a scholar, I recommend that you learn Python. It is the simplest, most logical, most approachable, and one of the most popular languages. Anything that is worth doing can be done in Python, and if you cannot learn Python, you cannot learn to program in any language. However, if this is what appeals to you, I think you will be better off in another field, like data science.\n\nIf you are only interested in computer science for the money, I recommend that you learn Java. You will have no trouble finding work, and you will never truly understand anything about programming or computers. Since that wasn't your goal anyway, everything will work out fine.",

Still, there are jobs that prefer or demand Typescript knowledge, which is just strictly typed Javascript. That means learning about interfaces, generics and type literals, which is nowhere near as hard because I know most of that from Java. \n\nThe idea I'm getting at is that knowledge of the concepts I learned in Java are helping me now, even though I never use Java. Now change the scenario and let's say I built projects with Java, but had to switch to C or C++. Then I'd be blindsided with memory management and pointers which take a long time to master, and time isn't on your side  with so many bills to pay.\n\nLanguages like Ocaml or Haskell are difficult to learn and I don't see many jobs for them. They are functional programming languages and most languages are OOP or procedural, so I think that these may be best saved for last or skipped entirely.",

Bear in mind that if you do things like wildcard queries, you will end up scanning the entire \"users\" table on every search.\n\nIf you care about scaling to large numbers of users, then you'll want to use a full-text search engine that can use an index for efficient searching.\n\nI'm not familiar with Prisma, but it seems to be a wrapper around Postgres, and Postgres supports full-text search using the `tsvector` and `tsquery` types. This allows you to create an index on a *tokenized* field, so that searches can efficiently find only the rows containing those tokens. You can customize the tokenizer to do things like approximate searches, where the tokens are partial words instead of complete words. All of this is relatively straightforward in Postgres, but I'm not sure whether/how Prisma exposes it.\n\nIf you need even larger scale, and you don't want your database to become a bottleneck for searching, then you'll want to use a search engine that's separate from your DB, such as Elasticsearch or Solr. This adds a lot of complexity because whenever the data in your DB changes, you have to synchronize those changes to your search index.",

And even if you had the audio, automatically determining the chord progression isn't simple or straightforward at all. There may be some advanced AI audio algorithms that try to do it, but I'd expect them to have errors.\n\nHonestly the most likely approach would be to fetch the playlist from Spotify, then search for online libraries of lyrics and chords, then try to analyze the chord progression from there. That would be complex but at least plausibly doable. I'm not aware of a centralized database with chord progressions for most songs, but there are plenty of places online that have them in nonstandard formats (often text). Then you'd have to parse various ways to write chords, transpose into the same key to normalize, and count how many are the \"same\".\n\nEven determining which is the \"same\" isn't easy. Do you count I, V, vi, IV the same as vi, IV, I, V? What about I, V7, vi, IV? There are lots of chord progressions that are very similar but not identical.",

You learn by making mistakes and figuring out how to recover from your mistakes (one of my own falls into the pit and climb out is journaled [here](https://steppingback269.blogspot.com/2025/08/crash-burn-rinse-and-repeat-your-slow.html))\n\nAs part my journaling blog where I log my progress in learning Python as a newbie, I am curating a page called \"Links for Python Noobs\" ([here](https://steppingback269.blogspot.com/2025/07/links-for-python-noobs.html)). It contains links to all sorts of resources that noobs can use. I don't pretend to be an expert. But take a look and maybe you'll find a beginner's resource that works for you. (I myself started cutting my Py teeth in Nana's Zero to Hero course --it's listed in the given link with many others. I also found Indently and Bro Code very helpful. Those are just a few.)\n\nGood luck with your own journey into the Python universe.",

Tiny wins build momentum. Making it practical also helps — build small projects like a calculator or tic-tac-toe so you actually see your code doing something.\n\nDon’t compare yourself to peers; everyone learns at a different pace.

Speaking from experience, coding just for assignment and stuff will drain the life out of you and you'll come to hate it.

This was 15 years ago so it's not all applicable (IMO the bar is so unreasonably high now) but maybe it'll help.\n\nI graduated in 2010 with a business degree. We were still coming out of the Great Recession and I had no idea what was going to happen. I only managed to land a job because I played World of Warcraft with someone who lived in the same city and he offered to refer me.\n\nIt was a back office position, mostly trade support and compliance. Not riveting or lucrative stuff. At this point, I probably had two things going for me: I'd been working with computers in some capacity since I was 5, and I had recently done an internship where I was exposed to VBA and general scripting.\n\nAfter about 6 months on the job, I started playing around with VBA to automate parts of my daily tasks away. My manager was very supportive and so were my IT folks. After that, I snowballed because as I wrote scripts to automate my work away, I had more time to experiment. As I experimented, I collaborated with other teams to automate parts of their work.\n\nAfter a year, I got poached by a hedge fund. I learned a few more things, but it was a bad environment for me and I got fired inside of 3 months. Luckily, I had built my VBA skills enough that I got contracted to work on a year-long project at a large financial institution.\n\nAfter that project, I joined a consulting firm where I used my VBA knowledge to make Excel and PowerPoint do some incredibly complex things. After two years, I realized I needed more; I didn't want to stay in this niche and I saw the writing on the wall that this might all go away in the medium term. A friend from college I kept in touch with referred me to his company.\n\nThat was my first opportunity in a tech company. But I wasn't a software engineer, more of a \"solutions\" engineer. But I applied everything I learned into this new role. Except instead of VBA and Excel, it was Python scripts, PHP, SQL, and a bit of Bash. I also made sure to understand the ins and outs of our entire tech stack.\n\nTwo more years, I made my way into FAANG and haven't looked back since (I'm no longer in FAANG, but I'm still in tech, making more money than I ever thought I would).\n\nA few takeaways would be that networking is important, but it can take on many forms that are conducive to introverts (I'm one myself). How many people can say they got jobs through World of Warcraft? Another thing is, everyone runs their own race. I'd say the first 5 years of my career had little direction, and it wasn't until 7 years in that I thought to consider myself a software engineer at all, but each step I took was a calculated risk to incrementally get me there. I was always adjacent to the tech, to the code, and demonstrated value to the point where the developers started listening to me.\n\nIf you have an opportunity to now, I would encourage you to take whatever computer science courses you can to set yourself up. You can always teach yourself (as I did) but sometimes learning in a formal, structured setting has its benefits.",

The point of software is to build something that works for a business or market problem, all these other languages sacrifice that correctness for being \"easy to learn\" while not admitting that most who learned that language stay stuck as a junior for a long time. \n\nSo if you want to learn fast, you need fast feedback on what you are doing wrong, and so you want a language like Haskell thats gonna give you that fast feedback.

See, websites are done with HTML, with the help of CSS to add aesthetics and JavaScript for making them dynamic. But there are frameworks done in Python that has to do with it.\n\nAn example is Django. It enables you to easily make a web app with python. You make some HTML templates, and install some Database program. Django then runs a web server, which takes the templates you make and fills it with data from the database. It also reads user input and makes it into data that gets stored on the database. How all of that is done is what you do with Python on Django.\n\nBut as the good ol' saying says: \"Jack of all trades, master of none\". Python **can** do pretty much anything, but that does not mean it is the best for everything. For example, if you want to do raw number crunching and high performance computing, Python is really slow, so languages like C or Fortran are more used in there.",

I believe you need to know how a program runs before you start coding. Also, I believe beginners don't know how to pick an appropriate size project, and that if they start projects right away, they fail to learn the basics, in particular, control flow. \n\nThat is, imagine you're a debugger (a program that lets you go step by step through a program). Could you do that without using a computer, that is, if I gave you a simple program, can you determine what it does?\n\n**Alternate approach**\n\nMany others find the standard method I've described boring and therefore hard to motivate themselves. So, they do the following\n\n* Pick a project\n* Google a lot to find enough relevant information to code it\n* Learn enough about coding while doing the project\n\nWhat they like about this approach is they are building something which is something they *enjoy*. Does everyone enjoy this? No, they don't. But for those that do, this kind of thing is super rewarding.\n\nHowever, there are problems with this approach. The first is it works for only a small number of people. They're able to find answers to what they're looking for. They are able to learn enough about programming to accomplish the task.\n\nTo me, this is the equivalent of going to a foreign country and trying to pick up the language on the fly. You read a few common phrases, and trust the people know enough English and can decipher your accent enough that you get by. Some find that approach better than an academic approach where you learn how to conjugate verbs and learn grammatical structure.\n\nWhen someone opts to do projects, they want to find something interesting and cool, but even the most boring programs you can think of (Hangman, Tic-tac-toe) are quite difficult for most beginners, and they want to write 3D first person shooters or have some AI or do some image or video processing. There are things they think are pretty easy, and it's incredibly difficult.\n\nHowever, you'll see more people posting \"do projects\" than the more academic approach.",

I followed the [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) program for a month and it showed me how to really solve small problems. You don't have to pay for something to learn problem solving. Good alternatives are: Excercism, The advent of code and Codewars. Another possibility is following The Odin Project, which focusses on the frontend first. It later introduces the backend in JavaScript or Ruby.\n\nIt is often hard as a self taught developer to know what you are doing. However, this might also be your advantage over CS students. Just start with something small, read documentation and a ton of articles on how to do it. It might feel like your are going slow in the beginning but it will pay off in being able to solve problems as a whole independently.\n\nTake the smallest idea, for example I build a full-stack application to play music in. The project itself was not very impressive but it gave me a ton of confidence in my abilities. Choose something small you are exited about and try to have fun doing it.\n\nGood luck! I believe in you!",

They may have \"skills\" that make them better suited for managerial or leadership roles. My manager says he has development experience, but he can't parse simple emails coming from Vendors informing us that they are changing their API tokens etc, and needs a dev to explain what is needed.\n\nPeople who are good at the technical stuff generally do not want the additional responsibilities, stress and the need to deal with other people that comes with being a manager. As an IC, my only interaction is with my team and with my manager, so around 6-7 people in total, and maybe 3 on an average day. My manager on the other hand, on average meets with 10 different people a day and maybe 25-30 people in total over a month. I never see myself as having the bandwidth to be able to tolerate that.\n\nIn short, tech leadership requires a Goldilocks person who is both reasonably adept at the technical side of what they are managing, and has the managerial and leadership skills that are needed for the role. These people are likely rare and are already at highly compensated roles, and they enjoy what they are doing. That means the rest of the market has to make do with the average and below average candidates, many of whom are the aforementioned people who convert from technical roles to leadership.",

[Here’s another Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) where someone shared that exact strategy and actually landed multiple remote offers from it.\n\nIf someone’s already inflating their resume and then stacking keyword optimization *and* mass distribution on top of it, the whole system becomes unfair. It makes things way harder for the people who are genuinely talented and putting in the effort to apply honestly.",

Whereas guys listing the jobs, set the parameters of how rigged it will be, then have to do a little \"extra work\" sorting through bullshit resumes then act surprised and pack a sad. I get it, job listers have leverage at the moment so they get to set the rules, but you can't be mad when you set bullshit standards and wonder why you're attracting bullshit candidates. \n\nIn short, the reason why resumes are inflated is because job listings and expectations are inflated. \"YOU MUST BE A ROCKSTAR CANDIDATE WHO BREATHES PYTHON\" and then you get the actual job and have to beg your manager for a permit to even get a log in.",

The lower the better. Do this multiple times a day, since postings get updated all the time. Don't even bother with anything over 100 applicants. 0-10 is the sweet spot. \n\n2. If you really see a position you like, tailor your resume to fit it. Use keywords directly from the job description and remove things that aren't relevant. I kept separate resumes emphasizing separate skill sets I have (e.g. a resume for AI skills and experience, a resume for web dev skills and experience, etc.). I found it worked much better than having a single resume with a combination of different skillsets. \n\n3. Mention things you did the past directly, and use numbers to support them (e.g. \"Delivered a system that reduced customer errors by 50%\"). One of the big things you want your resume to emphasize isn't just that you have experience in coding/data science/whatever, but how your experience was able to make an impact and deliver value. Don't be afraid to stretch out your experience to make that point, just be able to actually talk about what you did and how it delivered value.\n\n4. If a job requires a cover letter, it usually has less candidates. It sucks, but it's usually worth it. Don't use AI, just write about how your skills that are relevant to the position helped you deliver results.",

You need to be able to do the work, and you need to be able to get along with people.\n\nLook at what you wrote:\n\n>I think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.\n\nThis is a classic engineer/programmer mindset. You're assuming you're smarter than everyone else, and that's the reason you're having a hard time at work. I worked with someone whose first reaction to everything was seethe and talk behind people's backs. He complained once our manager didn't understand something and was just making things harder. I told him, \"why don't you just talk to him?\" Our manager had been technical in the past and was generally pretty easy-going. He went to talk to him, and they switched how they were going to do things. Some people get busy or can't spend the focused time to think through every detail. That's why they're assigning the work to you. While there are extremes, as in the case of the MBAs, there are a lot of senior technical people who are less hands-on-keyboard than they used to be who do understand all the work you're doing, but their time is better spent elsewhere.\n\nYou will run into people who argue the technical work is the easy part. In a lot of cases, you're working on something that is a known thing/solution/pattern. Think about all the people looking for jobs right now? A good portion of them are nearly interchangeable skill-wise. So other things have to help differentiate them, along with a little luck.\n\nYou should work on building relationships with people. This can be done in parallel with hard, technical work.\n\nSo many devs like to trivialize the work of others. Try working in an environment with great management compared to bad management, you'll see a world of difference. Try leading a team and not being allowed to be heads-down working on code day after day. You'll be doing very different types of work, and a lot of people struggle with the transition.\n\nThe dev work you're describing for building a website or an API is easy. Others have done it before, you can follow examples/instructions, etc. Yes, there start to be complications if there are some specific requirements, etc, but you're trying to either overstate how difficult it is, or you're not experienced with it.",

Part of our job is to help stakeholders understand what they’re asking for. On a good day, you get to drive them towards a particular decision and make them think it was their idea.\n\nIt sounds like you’re hoping that we, as a discipline, get recognized purely for performance on tasks that are hard to understand, and I’m not sure how that’s supposed to work. Communicating well about complexity is part of the skill set. \n\nAnd sometimes building a rickety MVP is critical for time-to-market, which can make or break the entire product.",

And yes, the customer doesn't always know what it is they really want. They might think they want something but they really want something else. It is also the job of a software dev (at more senior levels) to guide those customers towards something better suited to what they are trying to accomplish.\n\nIn short, coding is only part of the job. The higher up you go as a software dev, the less of it you do. As a lead dev, I mostly do requirements gathering, overall solution architecture, give status updates to directors and up and do code reviews for more  junior developers. I also do mentoring and training of course. Any coding projects I have are those that I assigned to myself cause I either don't trust someone else to do or because I have some spare time to fill.",

It's more about the stress of being put in impossible positions with limited autonomy.\n\nOne of the more common recent impossible positions is the expectation of living up to the expectations of somebody who has given you what they believe to be a magic box and being told that if you can't get the magic box to sing then you are a fucking failure.\n\nIt isn't just AI, of course, you could be given a horribly broken API and told to make it work. You might be given vague specifications (\"do thing that make profit!\") alongside very precise and bullshit instructions as to how you should implement something (\"using latest AI models!\"). You might have a coworker or boss whose approval you rely upon who is toxic. There are countless examples where your autonomy is stripped and you are put in an impossible position and you are pointedly told to deal and STFU.\n\nBurnout isn't limited to just tech, but I think it's more common in tech than most professions to have a few decisions made above you to render pointless the entirety of your work output while the expectations to \"perform\" remain.",

As a developer, spending less than 10% of my time actually developing (and instead wearing mostly Ops and BA hats because the employer doesn't want to actually have Ops engineers or BAs).\n\n6. The bureaucracy - Agile in name only, sprawling meetings, seemingly random change moratoriums, sudden drastic changes in policies, etc.\n\n7.

        "body": "I was laid off back in May. As the sole provider for my wife and two kids, i completely understand where your head is at right now. I was completely in panic mode and had a ton of anxiety around it. I’ll tell you what i did that helped me the most. \n\nI immediately got my resume updated and reformatted it. I used the pragmatic engineer’s template. Some here may frown on this, but asking ChatGPT for help writing bullet points was helpful for me. Not your entire resume, but just help summarizing things you want on your resume. \n\nApply for unemployment. It’s there for things like this, use it. \n\nReach out to your network. Nothing panned out for me within my network but reconnecting and chatting with colleagues was massively beneficial to my mental health. If you’re anything like me, it’s easy to think “im not a good developer, I’ll never convince another company to hire me”. Meeting with former colleagues and friends and hearing from them what I was good at and that I’m a good developer helped a ton. \n\nStart applying. I used LinkedIn (avoid easy apply. I’m convinced those are ghost jobs and scams) and Indeed. I kept a spreadsheet of places i applied. Mostly for my personal use but it does come in handy when filing your weekly UE certification. In my state, they require 5 weekly job search activities. Having this info handy makes it easier to file. \n\nWhile applying, spend time learning or working on interview prep. Have your story prepared and ready. Recruiter screens will usually be a general history of you and a high level overview of your experience. Be prepared to explain anything that might raise questions in your resume, good and bad. \n\nI used ChatGPT for technical prep. It was a massive help. Once you land technical interviews (and you will soon with your experience), use ChatGPT to help you prep. I pasted the job description into chatGPT and asked it to give me technical interview questions based on it. \n\nYou’ll also want to read Glassdoor reviews for the company you’re interviewing with. I wouldn’t have gotten the job i have now if i hadn’t done that. I learned they place a very high value on your “why join (company)” and going back to the prep, having that answer practiced and ready was massively helpful. \n\nI was laid off early May and started my new job, that is better in every way, at the end of June. While it’s true the job market is tough right now, it’s still pretty good for mid+ level devs. I got a decent amount of interest and actually landed a job I never thought I could get. \n\nYou also might look into contracting with your local/state government. There were a bunch of those in my area that would be perfect as an in between while you find something more permanent. \n\nLastly, just know that your worth as a person isn’t based on your job or title. I learned that I placed way too high of value on my job and being a provider for my family financially. Being able to step back and be that parent who’s there for the family and provides value in other ways helped me be a better dad and husband. You got this!",

People are really yelling about the job market and stuff, and I imagine that because I have 4 years till I graduate maybe the market will get better.

A lot of those listings aren’t even real, and many of the “applications” are just auto-apply clicks. That’s basically spam, and these platforms aren’t great at filtering it. Even when a post is legit, most applicants aren’t actually qualified for that specific role. I’m not saying the job market is healthy; it’s tough. I’m saying a lot of candidates are taking the wrong steps.\n\nInstead of relying on LinkedIn or Indeed, follow sites that pull openings directly from company career pages and look for roles that truly match your skills. Create a resume and cover letter tailored to each posting. Optimize for ATS and naturally include the right keywords from the job description, both the job title and the required skills, then apply.\n\nIf you’re focused on remote roles around the world, check out a creative method in this Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).\n\nMass-applying to thousands of jobs is just noise. In a pile of 1,000-plus applications in a couple of hours like the one here, I’d bet barely one or two actually meet the stated requirements. Be one of those.",

Sure, few interviews let me *literally* Google (some have, I just have to let them know I'm doing it), but every other interview has always made it very clear that I'm welcome and encouraged to ask syntax questions to the interviewer.\n\nNo interviewer I've worked with has ever been caught up on if I remember `.length` vs `.length()` (which I still get caught up on because of my heavy Java experience and my kinda recent transition to Node/Typescript). Nobody cares if I've memorized any of the syntax of the language I'm programming in. They care that I can program. That's why they're willing to answer syntax questions, which I've asked many times, and gotten offers from.\n\nI also don't recall a company that *forced* me to use a specific language. Hell, back in the pre-covid days we all whiteboarded in pseudocode anyways. But since I've been doing remote interviews, companies have always made it clear I was allowed to program in the language I was most comfortable in. Again, nobody's paying attention to syntax memorization, they want to see me solve a problem via logic. Not rattle off something memorized that the worst programmer in the world could memorize.\n\nSame for BE vs FE.... My current company is an example. I knocked the BE interview portion out of the park. I killed it. Then I got to the FE portion in React.... and I didn't do too well. I had to ask *a lot* of syntax questions, needed some nudging, some hand holding, and I didn't even finish the whole interview before time ran out.\n\nAnd yet, they gave me an offer. My resume made it very clear I'm mostly a BE developer, I made that very clear in the HR interview, I made that very clear in the HM interview. They knew what to expect, they just asked the FE questions as a formality. It may very well be the case that you're not doing as well as you think you are in the Java interview. That, or you're not making it clear that your strength is BE/Java, and not FE/React.\n\nI'm just surprised your experiences interviewing are literally polar opposites of mine. Literally everything you brought up, I've experienced the opposite of. I have 12 YOE, so I've been around the block.",

You're probably underselling the skills you gained herding cats at your old place and also learning what not to do by seeing the consequences.\n\n\nBe a little cagey about the old place, don't say it was a shitshow, say it was a small startup and the projects had unusual requirements for domain reasons but you still rolled with whatever they needed. \n\n\nOne of the important skills for someone more senior is not just to rubber stamp jira tickets but to instead understand work at a higher level and weirdly working at a dumpster fire company kinda bootstraps this!\n\n\nPlus you get to be known as a ray of sunshine to everyone when your circumstances result in you being over the moon happy to just work at a functioning company. And at a certain point a lot of advancement is soft skills and gaining allies so this really does help!\n\n\nSource: your story is very similar to mine and this worked for me.",

We haven't used it for years. But in documentation and informal conversation \"what's your LDAP?\" became synonymous with \"what is your username in our network?\" This persisted even after LDAP was deprecated. It's now been picked up on by people who have joined the company long after that deprecation.

Agile practices help inform frontend devs what works best by having a tight iteration process with customers. Though I’ve never seen that practically work out well. The best is to have dedicated UX people, who work with product, customers, and engineers to come up with a solution. Then hand that off to engineering to actually build it.

My experience is that most Juniors don’t know much coming out of college and that is ok.  \n\nBut, if they are passionate and approach things with the attitude of “I don’t know this but I can learn it” then they generally do pretty well.  So, in the interview if you are interviewing with someone like me you get extra points for admitting you don’t know something and taking a stab at it if you have an idea or saying you can ramp up on it.  If you follow up after the interview with a well researched answer as well as your thoughts it will make you a top candidate in my eval.  Just don’t copy/paste someone else’s, this includes AI, answer.  I need to see that you taught yourself something.\n\nAlso on my teams I want people to be willing to ask the “dumb questions” they think everyone already knows.

Your question, taken at face value, makes no sense. Why would an employer willingly choose a candidate with less demonstrated experience? The answer to this question is \"get more experienced\".\n\nI say this as someone who entered the industry in my 40s, with no CS background, no college, no bootcamps, no professional contacts in the field. \"How do I get hiring managers to consider me?\" was a question I asked myself, fruitlessly, for years. But as a hiring manager now, I get it. Why would I have considered me? And even if I have a disposition to consider more oddball candidates, given my background, there's still an ATS and a literal army of recruiter between me and our candidate pipeline, so I really never even get to see candidates who are oddball. Those are filtered out long before the candidate is talking to me.\n\nI'm interested to hear what other people here will say. I'm sure there are other ways to skin this cat. But the solution I settled on was to change my approach and expectations. I stopped applying for SWE and started applying to roles that were adjacent to, or had some plausible path to, where I wanted to be. I had zero impressive experience you could put on a resume, so I had to start far away, in (non-technical) customer support in my dream company. If you have some impressive experience but not impressive enough for a SWE role, you might consider something like Solutions Architect if you're more into operations, or some kind of Data Analyst role if you spike on the SQL/mathematical/statistical side.\n\nFind companies you think would be good to work for, and start looking through their open roles. Don't limit yourself to only the specific role you think you want next (and for which 100% of employers are ghosting you on).\n\n\\*Sure maybe once in a blue moon this happens for mostly unique or at least impractical reasons (\"candidate has 200k followers on Twitter and a strong social media brand as a SWE influencer\", \"candidate is a maintainer on some piece of OSS that is important to us\", etc), but by and large it's not a thing.\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Also my answer is calibrated specifically for your situation: breaking into the industry. If this question is coming from someone farther along in their career, the answer is different.",

I built several teams from scratch and was a founder at a AAA-scale startup. I left leadership at the start of 2025 for a multitude of reasons, none of which were performance based.\n\nThe first and by far most limiting factor for low or no experience candidate is opportunity. A well run engineering organization will have the fewest entry-level or low-experience positions vs other experience levels. And of those openings, you're competing against not just the other public applicants, but all the interns already at the company, and sadly, in many cases all the nepo babies with a close relation in the c-suite at the company. To maintain the appearance of complying with EEOC regs companies will usually post openings publicly even if they've already effectively decided who they want to fill the spot. So you have limited positions, and for many of those, the public posting isn't even real.\n\nThe next most limiting thing is that you just haven't had time to show on paper a good answer to the question: \"Why you?\". It's easy for me as an HM to stack rank resumes of mid to senior candidates because they've had a chance to show what they can do by having done it. The more experience a candidate has, the easier it is to evaluate them for skill and fit on paper. It's hard to rank entry level resumes with any confidence. So you're going to get noise here and be subject to a lot of arbitrary sorting and filtering mechanisms that are often arcane, arbitrary, archaic, and nonsensical.\n\n(continued)\n\ntldr for the follow-ups:\n\nOverall, for an entry level position, you're not trying to wow them your resume, skills, education etc; those are just filtering mechanisms. You need to show upside, curiosity, drive, self motivation, willingness and ability to develop. You are not going to be a net financial benefit to the team on day one. The point of hiring entry-level engineers is that we hope you'll become a productive mid-level and maybe senior level eventually (and hopefully on our team). You're a project. Show them that you're a project worth taking on.",

It doesn't sound like it is, it sounds like it's literally just you not letting yourself believe that you can take the time off without everything falling apart.\n\nThere are things you can do to help - like, you can put together a plan for when you're out, you can talk to your boss and tell them you have this irrational concern so that she can let you know that's not the case and you can totally go.\n\nBut it might be trickier than that.",

Not to disparage you or anything, but i view it as such a waste. Making millions for a company while you make pennies, the constant stress, this pressure of always having to make more money, this societal idea that a persons worth is based on their career, and to a lesser extent, money. In the end, we all die, in a random spot, at a random time. In that moment, all we will have are our memories, which will either be of fulfillment or regret, no money, none of ypur coworkers or bosses to comfort you, none of your worldy possessions. If working genuinely makes you happy, and if that is how you wish to spend your life, then good. However, if this thought gives you anxiety, maybe you should rethink not taking PTO.",

If you genuinely feel like no one can do your job while you're away, that's a huge weakness for your team - no single dev should be load-bearing on a project. It also isn't great for your ability to be promoted if you're seen as the only person who can do your particular job. \n\nThis would be a GREAT thing to talk to your supervisor about in your next one-on-one. \"I've found that I feel guilty taking PTO because I worry that things will break down while I'm gone. What can we do to make our team more flexible, so that our ability to function well doesn't depend on me specifically sitting in that chair?\" \n\nMaybe have some suggestions - more comprehensive documentation, perhaps some cross-training with others on your team so have more of a grasp of each other's particular roles? This could even be a great look for you if you can lead the charge in getting your team to a point where you're relying on process and not personnel.",

A school like WGU or other online schools are under 5k a semester, which is pretty easy to swing if you don't have other obligations. Get in the habit of keeping your expenses low now while you have your first big job, and it'll make life a lot easier.\n\n\nIf you intend to get it, try to get your degree before getting married and having a kid. 😂 It gets a lot harder otherwise.\n\n\nIf you want to chat and have another self taught contact, feel free to DM me.",

But they can be used as protection by the company to demonstrate that there were performance issues with the employee. The goal being to convince others that the company didn't wrongfully terminate for illegal reasons. In case the terminated employee decides to pursue legal action against the company.\n\nBy placing someone on a PIP they create a paper trail (no matter how flimsy it is) that the person wasn't performing their job well. I suspect it's also to cause doubt in the employee's mind about the likelyhood of prevailing in court. By having a formalized process where they told you, that you weren't performing maybe that can convince you to just accept it and quietly go away.\n\nAs for your second question there's only a few paths. One, do whatever they ask to get off the PIP if possible. Though to be honest it sounds like you wouldn't be happy in your current role (QA Automation/ not dev and poorly maintained code base). Two, resign. Three collect pay checks while looking for the next job until they fire you. Option three will yield unemployment.\n\nEach one has tradeoffs. E.g. if you get fired while on the PIP you probably won't want to use your boss at the job as a reference. If you have a long employment history and can use someone else as a reference that may not be a problem.\n\nI can't comment on disability so I'll leave that to someone else to comment on.\n\nI'm sorry you are going through this. Hopefully you find yourself in a better job soon.\n\nETA spelling out for the inexperienced that the boss from the job wouldn't be one to use as a reference if you waited out the PIP and got fired.",

He can do his work autonomously, but he doesn’t actually think about the business and what we can do to improve, he is technically strong. He takes something from the roadmap and kind of drives the execution, but he puts no effort into understanding why we are trying to do something or how something can be improved. He has to ask us for basic business context, which shows he is only focussed on a solution, he doesn’t actually care about the teams goals.

        "body": "I’ll try my best but in general the definition is fuzzy. When I interview with a senior engineer I tend to look for:\n\n1. Experience. Not in terms of years but in terms of lessons learned. I tend ask what project stays with them and what lessons they learned. How does it inform how they review designs and code. I’m mostly looking for people who have learned from their failures and can debug their code and designs and do the same for others. Do they have a story where they may have changed their mind after new information was gained or is it a constant stream of “my way or the highway.” This also means as a senior they do have a bit of a network and will have stories of how they talk to and manage people.\n\n2. Technical communication. As a senior, I expect them to be able to communicate not just for themselves but for the team and to be an advocate for reasonable designs while keeping the schedule in mind. I need them to tell me why things will take x days, not just that things will take x days. I want to know why they came to a specific decision and what other decisions did they consider. For people who have had a ton of experience doing this they will have a good signal to noise ratio.\n\n3. Team advocacy. Ultimately trust-worthiness and energizing a team are part of being a leader. Are they going to be a net gain of energy across the team under tight deadlines or are they going to be toxic? It’s hard to determine this within an interview, but as you work with them it gets easier to see. If they are motivated to work as an engineer usually that passion will come out in an interview and is actually hard to fake across multiple interviews. How do they interact with their maybe peers in the team/peer interview?\n\n4. It’s really corny but leadership. What I mean by this is that senior engineers shouldn’t argue from a stance of authority. Authority is given to someone because of who they are not because of the title they wield. How do they make their case? Is it with evidence and data or because they fall back on “experience?” This falls into the communication pillar too. If you have the experience you can tell stories and don’t need to say “because I’m senior.”\n\n5. Understanding of the scientific method. What I mean by this is I see engineering as the practice of making the same behavior repeatable. This means similar to science everything is a hypothesis to be continuously tested. SLIs, KPIs, etc need to ensure that we continue to be good. A senior engineer advocating for manual testing is fine as long as they have a plan for how we maintain that process and why we need to. Do they question our accepted reality or do they accept it without thought?\n\n6. Hard skills are a given and they should be fairly proficient in at least one language. This means they should be able to tell me how the language works and what it’s good for and not good for. They should have tried and tested ways to debug problems in said language and have a reasonably good understanding of how the language runs on a computer. Ie if I get a resume where the guy tells me he is a C++ expert of 10 years I expect him to be able to explain things like how vector or shared_ptr work or how exceptions work and how memory works for C++. They should have stories of how their language of choice is annoying or incomprehensible at times because with enough projects and lines of code all projects become annoying to manage in some way.",

Most of them have PhDs, and the ones with a masters came from a top Ivy then straight into FAANG. No opinion on the matter, just providing some perspective. My team is also not Canadian, so unsure how different that is in Canada. \n\nThere are benefits of staying in Canada. Not being an immigrant on a work visa is eliminating a source of mental strain. Canada is generally speaking more politically stable, and I find the Canadian cities I've lived in (I've lived for extended periods in the top 4 cities) to be much more chill than any cities i've been to in America. There is definitely a cultural shift. Safety is another one, if you compare a city the size of Toronto to any similar sized cities in America, it looks insanely safe. Violent crime rate is almost incomparable. We also have better labour laws, and great unemployment. If I get laid off here, I am entitled to like 45 weeks of unemployment pay of like 700 a week or something like that. All in all, personally as a Canadian I just cannot bring myself to want to grow roots in a tech hub in America like SF or Seattle due to the cultural and safety concerns. It might be irrational, but I genuinely like being in Canada, so I am willing to tank the downsides of it. \n\nDownside is obviously the pay. I worked in an Amazon subsidiary for multiple years and my American colleagues of the same level were being paid almost double what I make after you convert USD to CAD. That being said, that is not a good way to measure pay as our COL is high, but not as high as some would think. We also obviously have less companies to choose from, and the middle tier companies pay significantly less than the top tier ones, so you are going to need to bust your head and rely on luck to get into the top tier companies. \n\nThat being said, its completely reasonable to get a good career and life working in tech in Canada. I have worked completely remotely for my entire career, going from a known Canadian tech company, to Amazon, then to a big tech company offering more pay. I was able to relocate to a MCOL city due to the remote job and I'm almost mortgage free before turning 29. All this is to say that its going to be hard to break in, but its definitely still a good way of life. \n\nIf you got any more questions I can answer for you just go ahead and shoot!",

But from my experience, CS at UBC is pretty solid, and the program is renowned in Canada.\n\nI personally did a data science minor in addition to my CS degree, but you can also minor in statistics or math if you prefer to get some theory under your belt.\n\nTLDR: UBC isn't known for its ML curriculum, but the CS program is top-notch.",

If the work is satisfying to you and tickles your brain don't switch career paths to do something you don't enjoy, there's value in doing something you like. It's also difficult to find a career with this type of opportunity (even if you might struggle to find a job initially), you can work for a FAANG or F500 company without necessarily having to know the right people or live in the right place. Regarding your concern about actually finding a job, here's what I'll say:\n\n**You'll find a job**. If you're passionate and put in the work, you'll find a job.\n\n**Don't rely solely on your degree(s)**. Do what you can to stand out from the competition. Don't wait until you get your bachelors degree, don't wait until you get your master's, start *now*. Everyone applying for the same job as you has a degree (mostly). Build something and put it somewhere hirers can see, prove that you can do the job that you want. UBC is a good school, but honestly most company's don't care where you graduated from. Having a strong resume is 100x more valuable than the school you graduated from.\n\n**Apply for CO-OP's/Internships**. Realistically this is the best way to get a job when you graduate. Get an internship and do a good job. Not only does this gain you real world experience that can go on your resume, but you pretty much get a 4-8 month interview where you can prove to the company that you would be useful as a permanent employee and hopefully you have a job when or before you grad. \n\n**Finding a job is a numbers game**. Apply everywhere, you won't hear back from 90% of companies, it's just how it goes. Just apply everywhere and familiarize yourself with the hiring process, it will help in the long run even if you don't get the job.\n\n**Take what you can get.** It's mostly only difficult to find a Junior position right now so don't be picky when you start your career. Work somewhere for 2-3 years then search for the job you always wanted. Right now you aren't *that* valuable to a company (no offense). Maybe take a job at a small unknown company for a few years and view it as an opportunity to learn. \n\nIf you're passionate about CS all of this won't feel like work and it will get you a job.",

Everyone I graduated with ended up fine. This includes people who did stuff like polisci.\n\nRecessions and slow job markets come and go, the entry level job market sucks right now everywhere and its not good in any field.\n\nThe last thing is I would have a healthy degree of skepticism towards what people say in tech about their own job market. The field is very prone to coming up with stories and drinking their own koolaid. You will read everywhere about AI, but reality is you have several compounding factors that makes the job market suck right now. This includes high interest rates, which effects tech more than other industries as that means there is less startup money and financign out there, over hiring during the pandemic, general economic uncertainty due to tariffs and current immigration system in the u.s.  All of these things in the short term, but will go away at some point in the medium term.\n\nThe last thing is that I live in New York and regularly attend UBC alumni events. The recent graduates I've met have it so much better than 10 or 12 years ago. The one thing is UBC is a lot more recognized in the states as a university today, especially among tier a corporate companies. It used to be the case that the main way UBC students succeeded in U.S market wasa via american grad school, because professors knew of UBC students. Now a  days your seeing UBC students get jobs directly from undergraduate in Quant Firms, FAAANG and financial firms. THe one thing I will say is that almost everyone successful from UBC, leaves Vancouver.\n\nThe other thing to get is tech is never going away as a field even if all the doom and gloom is correct. You are going to one of the best universities in the world and its academic brand is extremely strong. As long as you can keep your grades up, pretty much every graduate school is fair game for masters and paths to any university exist for Ph.D. (this is not always true). The reality of the world is there are MANY paths to success for someone who is determined, has some luck and siezes an oppurtunity. UBC is a place that you definitely can find a path.",

Hiring managers often care more about how you think than whether you explain every technical term perfectly. Mock interviews, even with a friend or through platforms like Pramp, can also help you get more comfortable.\n\nBlanking out happens when your brain is overloaded. Try breaking things into simple, clear steps in your answers, and don’t be afraid to pause for a second to collect your thoughts. Interviewers usually don’t mind a short pause if it leads to a clearer answer. Over time, with practice, that blanking moment will happen less and less. Also, [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) shares a lot of tips like this. Breaking into tech, career advice, and handling interviews.

If you frame it as “hey I can pick up this task but I’m currently working on X, is this higher priority?” He isn’t just offloading work, he’s now thinking about how this task is going to fit into the sprint.\n\n\nAnother thing I started doing was to add “unplanned” tags to any task that was given to me mid sprint, so at the end when I’m questioned on why I didn’t finish everything I could point to the 5 unplanned tasks I got. Also it’s just good as a team to know how much unplanned tasks people are doing. \n\n\nThese suggestions assume your manager is a somewhat reasonable person. If they aren’t then they unfortunately might be expecting you to work extra to get this stuff done.",

And apply to roles where there is a coding round so those skills can shine through\n\n>I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber instead\n\nYes, that's called opportunity cost. It's same the logic with going to college instead of working somewhere right out of high school\n\n>So, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.\n\nThe way people on this sub bemoan coding interviews ad nauseam, I thought this was a desirable format for interviews\n\nI don't think you're being a negativity spreader. The fact that you're asking that question makes me think that way\n\n>You're still not the ideal candidate unless you have a lot more.\n\nIt depends on the role, always",

News at eleven!\n\n>No amount of thinking \"My ideas are worth a million dollars\" is going to change peoples minds if in reality they are not million dollar ideas, so it is just stupid and delusional to think like that.\n\nYou forgot \"pointless\", because the vast, vast majority f developers is not getting hired for their million dollar ideas. and I honestly have no idea what could possibly make you think otherwise. If that was even remotely true, the majority of developers would not be employed, or seeking employment - we would all be independently wealthy with out own products.",

Learn React, HTML, CSS. Fire are you getting data? Learn hire to build an API in the language and framework of your choice. The more popular and standard you are, the better your chances of finding a job. \n\nWhenever I see a resume that focuses on what was built vs what tools were used, I get sad. Making a monopoly clone isn’t the important part. But knowing how to build the different parts is. \n\nWorking on game mods is great and can be supplemental information, but unless you’re trying to work for a gaming company or work with that tech, it’s not that helpful. Oh, you made node for World of Warcraft using Lua. That’s great, but we’re need someone who knows Python and has used Pandas. \n\nIf you’re building “the next great thing,” you shouldn’t be working for some random company. But most of us won’t be building that next great thing. If you want a “normal” job, show some familiarity with the tools and concepts. It’ll make you a better candidate than the one building abstract school projects. \n\nPS - you can continue working in the next best thing in your spare time. \n\nThere’s still a numbers game going on right now, but you want to get the numbers aligned with you as much as possible. ",

(It's either that or making up lies about my experience which also seems like a bad idea). You agree that hiring people don't look at resumes charitably which leaves the uncharitable perspective as the more accurate one (So it isn't \"my resume is good and the hiring people are wrong\" instead it is \"my resume is bad and I need something to make it good\")\n\nThere's not much else I can do than make assumptions about why I'm not getting anything. If sending my resume out to places gets nowhere then the rational conclusion to draw is that the resume is not impressive to employers in any way. If hiring people aren't impressed by my projects than the only logical assumption to make is that the people being hired have significantly better projects in every way (more users, more profits, more relevance to each company).

When you say using C# for endpoints, do you mean building out API endpoints? Sounds like you may have missed out on a position because you didn't know how to do that. Have you gone back and tried to learn, in case it comes up again? You might see certain patterns come up in interviews. What are companies looking for? \n\nPortfolios feel like they are from another time, although you might be able to get an interviewer to take a look during your interview. But the problem is they can't be sure if you actually built the thing yourself unless they ask you questions about it. If you're looking for an entry-level position, no one is expecting you to have created a big project on your own. They want to see what you know. But building a project is one way to learn these things. \n\nLook at your own reply. You got rejected because you didn't know how to use C# for endpoints (possibly just one factor). You say you know C#. What have you built with it? Is it something relevant and useful for a position, or is it something that would make sense for some other type of job? For your meal planner, what was the backend? How are you storing data? Those seem like logical questions I'd ask to get a better idea of someone's background during an interview. \n\nI interviewed someone coming out of school once. She didn't have a ton on her resume. She listed school projects. Once I started asking questions about the projects, she couldn't answer anything. Was it too long and she forgot? They were group projects, did someone else do all the work? She couldn't answer, so I wasn't really left with much. She started looking like someone that may have misrepresented stuff on their resume.",

I can talk about how I organized meetings and organized the documents for the group project but that isn't very good, like I feel like the answer they want is something more like \"I was the project manager for a project I did at XYZ company and I organized all the tasks into a trello and assigned all the tasks to people myself...\"",

Not just design documents, but proof of quality such as all code reviews are documented with minutes and so forth.\n\nFor many medical devices, it's not if but when will somebody die on the device.  At that point there will be an investigation to make sure the dialysis machine didn't kill the person, but their failing kidney.",

At Metana we've seen people make this exact transition without dropping 50k on a degree. The trick is building a portfolio that shows you can actually do the work, not just pass exams.\n\nYour research internship is clutch, lean into that hard. Start contributing to open source ML projects, build some models that solve real problems, document everything on github. Companies care way more about seeing you ship ML products than seeing another piece of paper.\n\nAlso lol at \"computational biology being a one off\", that lab probably just follows the funding, which is how academia works. Don't take it personally.\n\nIf you're dead set on the masters route, consider part time programs or even bootcamp-style intensive programs that focus specifically on ML/data science. Way cheaper, way more practical, and you keep earning while learning.\n\nBut honestly? With your big tech experience, I'd bet you could transition internally at a different company before needing any additional schooling. The key is positioning your SWE skills as \"I understand production systems AND ML theory\" rather than \"I'm just another SWE who wants to do ML.\"\n\nThe market sucks right now but ML roles are still out there, especially if you can show you understand both sides of the equation.",

So my advice would be to pick something and simply stick with it.

People mocked me at the time for not “following my passion,” but 20 years later, my fruitful career has given me ample opportunity to pursue my passions in my own time. My friends who got “passion” degrees like art, music, history are all doing odd jobs and barely surviving now. Except for one friend who became a sommelier and makes crazy money.",

I think the best advice I can give you is to consider all the practical life factors of your careers ahead of your current interests. Of course it is important to enjoy and have interest in your work, but when you have the tendencies you describe (which for me are related to adhd) there are basically no jobs that will hold your interests in the way a hyperfixation will. You can be in the field you’ve always dreamed of and your job will still be boring (especially early career) and require you to have focus on boring mundane tasks that are necessary. \n\nGiven that I would suggest you think about things like job availability, locations that are hiring, starting pay, career growth, working environment/culture, ability to gain transferable skills, and generally how you want your life to look. You should make choices now that will enable you the greatest flexibility/options. I highly recommend narrowing your choices to a couple things, choose the degree that wins out of those, and aim for 2-3 internships between those couple fields. Depending on your internship experience you can pivot, change degrees or whatever. Personally I chose CS/SWE due the flexibility of types of roles, the pay, possibility for remote work in the future etc.",

Large tech companies especially love throwing CAP theorem, load balancing, and scaling questions at frontend candidates to see if you think beyond just the UI layer. That said, plenty of companies still focus purely on frontend-specific system design like state management, component architecture, performance optimization, and API integration patterns.\n\nYour experience with mostly frontend-focused interviews isn't unusual, but as you level up in your career, expect more full-stack system design questions to creep in. The good news is you don't need to be a backend expert - you just need to demonstrate you understand how frontend applications fit into larger distributed systems and can make informed decisions about caching strategies, data flow, and performance bottlenecks. The key is showing you can think holistically about user experience from both a technical and architectural perspective. I'm on the team that built [AI for interview practice](http://interviews.chat), and we've seen this trend where frontend roles increasingly include broader system design discussions, so having a tool to work on these trickier cross-domain questions can really help you stand out when these curveballs come up.",

The reasoning is that even if the immediate role is largely frontend, we're not hiring \"react devs\", we're hiring software engineers who may need to pivot and pick up other stuff at some point.\n\nYou don't need to name drop every concept under the sun, but given a set of requirements, you do need to choose the system components in a sensible and defensible way. What happens a lot is people name drop something somewhere that sounds like it might fit at a glance, but doesn't quite make sense in conjunction w/ everything else they added around it, I ask them a question about it, and they admit not knowing much about it, or worse they wing it, poking more and more holes into the design as they go.\n\nFor example, we might be talking about performance, and then they add redis somewhere in the diagram, but it's in a suboptimal place, or they didn't think about cache invalidation or whatever, and then they start adding bandaid arrows and it just goes downhill from there.\n\nAnother thing that a lot of candidates are surprisingly bad at is schema normalization, and that comes up quite a bit because data modeling is a sort of a \"checkbox\" topic.",

You go home that night and start furiously sending applications. Only you realize that nobody else uses Coldfusion and whatever other ancient database software that you used at this job.

Unless you are an exceptional self-taught dev who has notable contributions to large open source projects, you can’t.\n\nIf I was given two equal resumes for juniors but one had a CS (or related) degree and the other didn’t, I would choose the CS guy 9/10 times. I would just assume they have a better grasp on the fundamentals of how an OS works, networking, algorithms, etc.\n\nIf this is a life or death thing for you, I’d say your best bet would be going back to school and trying to get a degree, but even that doesn’t guarantee you a job right now.",
