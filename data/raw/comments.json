        "body": "Well, its important to remember that the Kimball and Inmon standards were developed in the 80s.  I think there‚Äôs three key trends that have happened in ensuing decades that explain the mess we‚Äôre in today:\n\nFirst and most obviously, computing has gotten exponentially more powerful. A big part of the reason people cared so much was because they literally had to. Nowadays, no one gives a crap, and if you‚Äôre a conspiracy theorist, you could even argue that medallion architecture is being perpetuated by cloud providers as a way to extract more money from their clients. \n\n**Quick edit based on some responses:** I‚Äôm definitely not saying there aren‚Äôt any positive aspects to medallion architecture and ELT supplanting ETL. But whether it‚Äôs *necessary* is a different question and one that, IMO, businesses should really think long and hard about rather than just defaulting to whatever the FAANG companies are doing or whatever the vendor‚Äôs recommendation is. Maybe I‚Äôm just old, but I can recall a time when the bronze layer lived in an FTP site (lol) and the Gold layer didn‚Äôt exist, and yet companies were still able to answer business questions and turn a profit. \n\nSecond, and somewhat related, technology just moves so fast that you‚Äôre migrating platforms every couple years, in some cases. There‚Äôs a sense that tech debt is unavoidable, and the Agile/MVP approach exacerbates this as well. So no one really cares as much about getting things right the first time, because you know you‚Äôll have to rebuild it anyway. \n\nThird, while the concept of ‚Äúdata‚Äù has been democratized and de-mystified quite a bit in the ensuing four decades, the actual database part of it still has somewhat of a barrier to entry. So I think part of the issue is that ‚ÄúCan I get this in Excel to do my own analysis?‚Äù has become such a ubiquitous question that you can‚Äôt really say no to it, leading to a bunch of bespoke OBTs that aren‚Äôt documented particularly well, if at all. \n\nIMO modeling is still important, but it‚Äôs largely because of BI/Data Viz software adoption and not database constraints themselves anymore.",

Im being serious this is a \"pub\" kinda question that sadly I dont have collegues that share the same spark to discuss with.\n\nThis industry has evolved so fast that terms have been highly convoluted and become some what meaningless. \n\nWhen I began my career Kimball was king and the data mart with at least star schemas were the expected minimum. Largely because of the limits of what we had (relational databases with indexes). To get things to work you had to thoroughly understand the requirements, plan and model accordingly.\n\nCompute and Storage are cheaper than beer (sadly), with that has come with the more lazy approach in favour of quick (although unstable) returns. We follow agile, we don't like long winded projects and if your query doesn't work then just add more compute.\n\nWith this a generation has been bombarded with buzzword bingo. We have data lakes, lake houses, and other infrastructure terms. We also have data mesh, fabric and other strategic ideas that i always feel are more idealised than realistic. A person can only retain so much and indeed the core ideas of warehousing have disappeared. I asked someone if they would consider implementing surrogate keys, he asked me if I had made that up.\n\nIt does feel like we are re learning alot of the problems that we had in the 80s just in different guises. I feel that maybe were just old enough to notice the turn of the wheel. What was learned will be forgotten and re learned again.\n\nModelling will always be important, but modelling relies of having some key information.... like what do you actually want to achieve? What are you measuring.... I think most of this sub will admit.... actual requirements are always few and far between. Keeps us busy rebuilding stuff though lol.\n\nId love to see what the modern equivalent of erwin is?\n\nAnyway... your not alone...\n\nDo you know what would be cool.... a podcast going through the datewarehouse tool kit and data modelling!",

They don't want to talk about it because they don't have a solution to make it more productive.  So, instead of admitting that it's a hard problem and they mostly work on the easy problems, they instead just try not to talk about it.\n\nThey *should* talk about it - since it impacts performance, data quality, query functionality, usability, and operational and development complexity.   And practitioners should also talk about it for the same reason.  But this field has always been marketing-driven, and data modeling is difficult.  So, they don't talk about it like we did 25 years ago.\n\nBut that doesn't mean nobody is.  It definitely still matters when operating at scale, whether that's data volumes, performance and query response time or its the number of fields, feeds, and models.",

When I started my professional career in data, a 2-year Datawarehouse build-out project was the norm. We used to do rigorous requirements gathering (for months!), hire a multitude of skilled people to document the business processes, track down data sources and cover every inch of the enterprise reporting needs on paper. Then the laborious phase of ETL, physical data modeling, test runs, and QA will ensue. Finally some BI team would develop the static reports and before you know it, it‚Äôs already 2 years gone!\n\nNowadays, every single business comes pre-wired to collect and move streams of raw data all over the place. Costs of data storage have significantly dropped so dumping it all in into a cheap cloud storage is a no-brainer and it‚Äôs an acceptable approach. Storage and compute are now segregated so no upfront unutilized servers anymore. \n\nI guess the fundamental idea behind serving data analytics has switched from building robust, audited and reliable DW architectures to just-in-time data modeling for a quick turnaround to answer a certain business question ASAP. It also allows for incremental question-answering with the same just-in-time analytics approach instead of asking business stakeholders exactly what questions they‚Äôd need answered for next 10 years and expecting them to have an answer for you. \n\nI‚Äôd say it‚Äôs just a paradigm shift that has acceptable flaws with upside advantages that outweigh the said flaws (i.e. lack of emphasis on the traditional DW approaches we built our careers around in the past).\n\nEdit: also wanted to mention how the term ‚Äúdatawarehouse‚Äù has now been usurped by the vendors to mean ‚Äúsnowflake, redshift or GCP‚Äù. Not the Kimball or Innmon style datawarehouses we used to build. In fact, Bill Innmon (he‚Äôs in my LinkedIn network) wrote a very expressive LI post about this a year ago. Now I see even him kind of coming to terms with the fact that the old school DW as a industry and a domain is dead.",

With the advent of 'off the shelf' solutions like JDE, Peoplesoft, SAP...etc the need to design your own models fell off a cliff.  While a BI/DW model is designed differently, it was generally the people with existing OLTP model knowledge that went down this path as well.\n\n\\- As others have stated in this thread, 3NF or better modelling was a means to help squeeze the best performance out of hardware solutions.  This is not as much a concern now.\n\n  \n\\- The 'need for speed' (AGILE) has caused our industry to get lazy and not worry about design.

But it‚Äôs more integrated within the Snowflake platform and uses semantic definitions to give results. Also, there‚Äôs no option to train on a local LLM.",

You need experience as the end consumer of a data stack (or lack thereof), have some comfort with software engineering as opposed to simply \"knowing how to code\", and put in the work to learn how to build and maintain the plumbing that enables data to make its journey from source to business value. This last part takes years of work.\n\nThe most common story I see (and mine is more or less the same): STEM major works as DS/DA/BI analytics/similar position. Slowly starts contributing to the data stack, at first with small contributions and incident reporting/response, then with more substantial contributions. They either make the switch in-house or move jobs and suddenly find themselves in a position of autonomy to build. From this point you become a DE in a few months, by definition.\n\nI suggest you *don't* look for DE positions. Look for any other job as a data practitioner, and try to slowly move upstream on the data stack from there. It really does take years.",

You are given much more autonomy than working in house because your client assumes you know what you're doing based on your price tag and the fact your sales team probably sold you to them as an \"expert\".

I've been doing some similar things in our journey to optimize context for vizualisation tools we use that produce dashboards and graphs based on SQL. \n\nMy observation so far has been that SQL in itself is so well ingrained into the standard LLMs that you have to build something quite sofisticated to compete with the LLM running schema + sample queries (for exploration), and then producing queries on that.

I am not a big graphdb person so I don't know, but have built semantic models the other way and had mixed results with AI.\n\nIn the end though the challenge for me was more about semantics and synonyms than anything else.  In a business people say the same thing 10 different ways and it's often hard for the LLM to interpret what they mean, especially in the context of your business.  I found we needed synonyms not only for tables and columns but for values as well and sometimes the context that was relevant to the answer was who asked the question.  I could make it work if you ask it things in exactly the right way, but that's not the point of a conversational tool like an LLM.",

It simplifies a lot of the tediousness of using DBT with Airflow (v2.9). It is easy to generate your DBT assets and those can be linked with your other dagster assets.\n\nThe main difference is the paradigm. Dagster does not have jobs/tasks at the forefront. Jobs are a process to group functional assets together i.e. you have 1 ingestion process and 3 DBT models to generate your analytics table and you can ran all of them at once, on schedule.   \n\n\nDagster uses data assets at the forefront, which are what the name suggests, your data as an asset. You do not think of the process of creating the data as you think of the final data product. \n\nI ike the lineage feature, which allows you to see how all your assets are interconnected. You can define a job with a schedule for any cut of your lineage graph.\n\nDagster is also more pythonic than Airflow. You use python's best practices when writing your processes.\n\nTesting is much simpler with the integrated 'dagster dev' command which quickly spins up a local instance for you to test your pipelines. \n\nCan write a lot more about the difference but I am at work now :-D.\n\nTo conclude, both are good tools (haven't tried Airflow v3+) but for different needs. Dagster is better for companies where data lineage is vital, whereas Airflow is better for automation of tasks.   \nData pipelines are good in both (however, in dagster it gets tedious to integrate a random pipeline with the rest of your asset lineage)",

One task that extracts, one that loads and one that transforms. Of course this is highly dependent and it helps to be pragmatic. In some instances you'll need to break these patterns. For example when we need seperate retries, resources or parallelism.\n\nFor example:\n- Task one: triggers a lambda to extracts data from an API & stores in S3\n- Task two: lambda that fetches the file from S3 & loads it into a Snowflake table.\n- Task Three: Python operator within Airflow that triggers dbt run (could also have this in a lambda).\n\nThen on the topic of passing data between tasks. Using the above example, passing the s3 uri from task one to task two would be a great use of xcom. Here, we're mainly passing metadata (row counts, S3 keys, schema versions, URLs, run decisions).\n\nWe'll typically want to use object storage for larger payloads (CSVs, json, etc).",

And there are tools like Alembic which someone‚Äôs already mentioned to help you version, test and deploy these sorts of changes easily and reliably.\n\nSo ‚Äúmy Data is going to change and evolve‚Äù is really not a good reason to use a document store like mongo.\n\nThe use case for a document store is really when your data is literally arbitrary. By this I mean that it will be completely different from one document to the next. And there‚Äôs no particular reason to expect any record to overlap with any other.\n\nEven if there is a subset of your data which really does fit this description, you can still allow for it in Postgres with the use of the jsonb column type which others have mentioned.\n\nBut from what you‚Äôve described, your data probably is very similar and predictable from one record to the next. All the personnel are presumably going to have names and IDs and other common properties. In this context, you are giving up a lot by using a document store, such as the ability to reliably query the data, to enforce rules that maintain quality and integrity, and to optimise for certain use cases.

You need to figure out what the value is for someone, and then cut all the explanations that are not useful in, well, explaining it. That's a tough one for me because it also meant having to let go of my ego - as in: having to drop some information and explanations that I really found good / useful when they don't help in making the messageseven clearer.\nMaybe \"Storytelling with data\" is helpful for some situations?\n\n- I'm not saying that's the case for you but for me one big learning was that I'm probably not the most important person, and that what makes my job interesting to me is not relevant at all. It also doesn't matter whether my solution is picked - not whether it's implemented in the way that I envisioned it. What matters is that the team as a whole benefits from an idea - I had to shift to a broader view of things rather than just of me and my work. This takes self-reflection and it also takes experience. \n\n- Also, what I do is a service to others. Have a look at leaders who have a service-mentality to their leadership style and try to emulate them.\n\nGenerally, what helped was direct feedback and interacting with colleagues. What worked less is trying to figure things out by reading and thinking it through - that useful sometimes but it doesn't cut through my echo chamber. What's still missing for me, some people need an explanation that's not an explanation but a story that they can digest on their level of understanding - I sometimes struggle if I have to simplify it so much that the story stops being meaningful to me.",

When you are ready, you will know you are.  \n\nData Engineering is like getting a Ph.D in random intertwined data problem solving.  It's not entry level, and it's certainly not something you can do with a class or two.  \n\nStart with analytics, dashboards, learn where the pipelines go, and then start moving up.  Once you understand the processes going on, find the next process in line.  Keep doing this until you can look at data and understand the whole business use case and story behind the data you're looking at.  \n\nThis takes a long time.",

        "body": "Firstly, you are asking a good question. You're trying to get a benchmark and basically a decent KPI. \n\nSecondly, the answer to your question hardly exists. I've seen people called a Sr DE with 2 years of experience as a DE, Ive seen someone called a Lead DE because they moved from a Lead DBA role to their first DE role. I know a person in consulting who is just a DE and has been a DE or SWE for 15 years. He is far better at coding that I am, and makes more money, but doesn't have the same level of title as others with far less skills. \n\nMyself, I spent my first year writing code, building pipelines, fixing bugs and closing tickets. Then everything changed and I am now running teams of implementation partners to build out enterprise projects. Nowadays, the only coding I do is to review PRs. I draw up architecture, work cross functionally with other teams to solution things, and tell my teams what all needs to be done with some guidance on how to do it. Someone else at a different company would need to work 10 years before being trusted to do what I do now. My job title will change to Sr DE next year per my manager. And I'll have 2 years of DE experience at that point, and a year of that is barely technical. \n\nFor a standard 3rd year DE, if one even exists, I would start to expect a little more autonomy. Learn to make decisions. Start figuring out and proposing architecture. Start mentoring younger DEs and try to lead some small projects if you aren't already. By this point, you shouldn't need to be told what to do on a project, you should be able to identify what needs to be done, and work to implement it. A big thing is that you should probably at least start working with other teams on cross functional projects. Begin thinking about business value of various projects. \n\nI learned, albeit slowly, that maintaining collaborative relationships with other teams is vastly more valuable than transactional relationships. They are more complicated to manage, but it is the only approach I've seen work to actually get things done. Churning out tickets and bug fixes is a good way to inflate your performance numbers, but it rarely amounts to career growth or any of the stuff you work on actually being used by the business as a whole.",

For example the NFL starts next week, you could scrape fantasy football rankings from multiple sites and calculate each player's average rank (or some other analysis). Matching the players will be non-trivial, because different sources aren't consistent about use of nicknames, suffixes like Jr., or exactly how to write names (Ja'Marr vs Jamaar).\n\nThen it's reasonable to build a medallion architecture. Bronze layer is raw html snapshots (or maybe jsons from an api). Then have an ETL process to turn those into tabular data with a consistent format and names (and/or an arbitrary player id) and store in the silver layer. If you want to get fancy that could be a sql database with a few tables (rankings, sites, players). It could also be a csv. Then another process to aggregate by player across sites and store in the gold layer (if you want you could automate collecting daily snapshots and analyze the change over time). That might be something like another sql table that exists to serve a dashboard.\n\nSports is just one example, there are lots of domains where you could scrape (or otherwise obtain) multiple sources of data then (fuzzy) join and aggregate them. If you don't want to do fuzzy matching and multiple scrapers/interfaces, you could do daily snapshots of something like pokmeon card prices or the weather and aggregate across time. This sort of thing is a common use case for a simple but non-trivial data pipeline.",

My guess is spark looked at the code submitted and calculated that it's more efficient to run it with a smaller number of workers rather than scaling out (maybe because the data isnt huge so it's faster to do it all on one node?). Spark may be wrong about this since you're using gzip files so maybe try converting/saving to parquet first and then running your data processing on the parquet files and see what happens. Gzip typically takes more time to decompress so breaking the job into two parts (decompressing in part 1 and transforming data in part 2) could help triage the issue better. Do you see performance gains when using more nodes? \n\nUDFs typically aren't great for performance, what does the UDF do specifically? I've found the built in functions are pretty good at doing what you want if you're a little creative, plus they're going to be faster. Also if you're using >30 withColumn statements that could be slowing down performance a bit since i believe each one makes spark recalculate the logical plan, so you could try using withColumns instead.",

The caveat is that scala/python UDFs are opaque to catalyst/photon, so you should basically try your hardest to never use them, as they are a blocking step between optimizations before and after the calling of the UDF.

Sit down with key business people and find the most important questions they want answering.\n\nThen, find what data sources you'll need to answer those questions. In the beginning, this is typically financial reporting / sales related. How much money are we making, etc.\n\n2. Focus on delivering these core information sets at first, before doing ANYTHING more fancy. Give the business the ability to answer their super basic, but essential questions.\n\n3. Data stack:\n\nAzure is fine, but i'd personally reccomend AWS or GCP.\n\nSimilar with Databricks - it's fine and will work, but they specialise in data science, you're probably better off with BigQuery or Snowflake if the focus is analytics.\n\nI'd avoid PowerBI and use Tableau. Or, if you can afford it, Looker.\n\nOpen source tooling is great. I'd highly reccomend dbt for the data transformation layer. And airflow for orchestration.\n\nData ingestion, as you've mentioned, as a one person  team. managed pipelines are a good place to start: airbyte, fivetran or stitch. Just be conscious of costs here as they can rack up, versus custom implementations (using lambdas, ECS etc).\n\nFeel free to dm me any questions!",

It‚Äôs built for developers who want fast setup and easy alerts. AWS CloudWatch is much more powerful but focused on deep infrastructure/app monitoring for everything in AWS‚Äîgreat for big teams, but overkill if you just want lightweight job status alerts.

If a specific data model is being refreshed then recursively traverse through the depends_on field until each path ends, then sort them. You can also group data models together by a tag and filter to that tag.\nI‚Äôve used this in other contexts, but never actually for managing data models, so you should consider the maintenance considerations and whether it would work within your context.",

Synthea produces pretty clean data, at least in the sense that I believe it places data in the fields where they need to go, the fields are used as intended, and the data is relatively predictable. \n\nDo you have any recommendations on how I could implement the types of issues that require mapping the data to expected outputs?",

We also took part in **MWC Barcelona in both 2023 and 2024,** and while it is a massive event, it offered solid technical content around AI, IoT and digital transformation with live demos and case studies.\n\nFor developer-focused tracks, **Berlin Buzzwords** is a good choice if you‚Äôre into data engineering and search technologies, and the **Data Innovation Summit in Stockholm** usually brings very practical case studies. Since you mentioned **apidays in London**, that one is definitely worth checking out too because it covers APIs and AI with a good balance of technical content and ecosystem discussions.",

Or can I just, lets say, write a json to represent the order and send it directly to the pipeline, keeping the production schema only with `customers` and `products` tables? Would that be too far from what actually happens in real scenarios? I'm afraid I may be oversimplifying things.\n\nI'm guessing that, in the \"real world\", an e-commerce needs to write the customer orders first in its production database to keep track of stuff similar to what I described in the last paragraph of my post. Should I take that into account for my project? If yes, for how long the data is kept in production? After an order is considered *closed*, can it be instantly deleted from the database to live only in the warehouse?",

The native AWS path (Kinesis > S3/Redshift or DMS > Redshift) is solid but you‚Äôll quickly bump into issues with schema drift and retries, plus the operational overhead is not trivial\n\nTools like Estuary or Artie can definitely help, since they focus on change streamss and schema evolution out of the box. For datastore, if you want the most flexible analytical layer, Snowflake or BigQuery are still the safer bets Redshift is convenient inside AWS, but less forgiving long term.\n\nOn the consistency side: some teams solve this by using platforms that sync DynamoDB into relational stores in near real-time while handling conflicts automatically. Stacksync, for instance, is used in that pattern to avoid the ‚Äúbatch ETL lag‚Äù problem you get continuous sync and your dashboards are always up to date without hand-rolled jobs",

Then, in your materialization, you can use partition selectors to direct specific partitions to different tables:\n\n```\nmaterializations:\n ¬†acmeCo/example/database-views:\n ¬† ¬†endpoint: ...\n ¬† ¬†bindings:\n ¬† ¬† ¬†- source:\n ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†name: acmeCo/anvil/orders\n ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†partitions:\n ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†include:\n ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†customer: [Coyote]\n ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†resource: { table: coyote_orders }\n```",

For some like Salesforce it's easy as they publish their model and your CRM team get to add custom fields. You can then pull a source entity such as Customer or Case into your data platform. Other tools like Siebel will have 5,000 tables of which 100 will contain domain data, each of those tables will have 100 of columns so the task here is the identify which tables and columns are relevant - depending on how the system is configured. The final example is Success Factors, here they expose data through reports and APIs. The internal schema is their IP and not shared, but you can find out from the API spec or report engine what you can extract. \n\nMy last 2 projects has kept data for ingestion close to the source with an initial seed load and then the delta loads.  After that we current have a raw data vault which is essentially facts and type 2 history tables. Then we have the business consumption layer which applies any business logic that allows the BI team to create their dashboard. \n\nIf I had asked you to do this then I would not want a generic schema for source but details of what I can get from the source system as raw maintaining their schema. Then its the best way to manage a staging environment that manages the history. \n\nIf you have a number of the source schema ready then it's best to clarify what your manager's expectations are. \n\nWhat is your environment ?",

If you know 100% you are going to be using Airflow in the future then sure use Airflow.\n\nSpark pools will do this for you. I'd avoid data flow where possible and use native spark because data flows are quite literally double the cost of straight spark.

I'm not sure what exactly *the* small files problem is or what *your* problem is in particular, but if you're looking to, say, keep only the latest values based on some key across multiple files, you have a few options.\n\nOne option is as I described: compaction. Go across your files and grab only the most recent data you want/need, merge into a new file, discard the old ones. Whether you want to implement this and how kinda depends on your exact data needs, so it's hard to say. At the very latest, I'd do this before archiving any data.\n\nThe other is to just track all changes in the data in your silver layer and grab the latest value. It's not really solving the small files problem though. Worst case scenario is just appending the files into a large file and keeping track of the file from which it came (or timestamp, whichever is more important).",

Ship fast where the blast radius is small, slow down where correctness matters.\n* Invest in tooling mastery. Know your editor, shell, OS, browser devtools, and typing. The compounding payback is huge.\n* If you cannot explain why something is hard, it is probably incidental complexity. Remove that first.\n* Fix bugs by establishing invariants one layer deeper instead of sprinkling checks in leaf code.\n* Use history to debug. Read the commits, narrow the regression window, and run git bisect when the shape fits.\n* Bias toward shipping to get real feedback. Use pragmatic shortcuts like asserts on invariants, deferring DTOs, and skipping trivial tests when risk is low.\n* Make debugging cheap. Seed data easily, add local tracing, keep a scratch REPL file, enable frontend debug toggles, dump full state with diffs, and add helpers to jump the UI into target states.\n* On a team, ask questions early. Do the five minute search first, then get unblocked fast.\n* Protect shipping cadence. Aim for quick deploys, low bug rates, fast cross-team handoffs, reusable patterns, and lean process. Cut the 10 percent of a feature that eats 50 percent of the time. \n* Treat slow shipping as a problem to root cause.\n* Learn to code review. a code review is an invitation for feedback and to get another pair of eyes on your work. To catch issues before it goes to QA.",

You're learning the conventions and rules and architecture of your new project. That's useful! You're learning best practices. You're learning good style. You're developing a little voice in the back of your head that will whisper \"the reviewers won't like this\" to you, and that's a useful voice to have in your head.\n\nMy main advice here is that being corrected in a code review is never a problem, but being corrected in the same way in many code reviews is a problem. Internalize their critiques, and make sure you don't do things wrong in the same way the next time and the time after that.

With a human language, if you know it well, then you can really express ANY IDEA AT ALL with finesse and comprehensibility. But with programming languages it's not really that way at all. Although formally programming languages that are \"Turing complete\" can be used to express any program, in actual practice, some tasks/types of programs are definitely way easier in some languages than others. \n\nProgramming languages are tools, more like a hammer and a saw. You need to know how to use both of those, based on what task you are going to do. Also there are many types of hammer, many times of saw, just like there are many flavors of some programming languages that resemble each other. When you're first learning, you should learn to use an easy-to-use one, a safe one, etc. Later on, you can learn to use more powerful tools, more specialized tools.\n\nIt is the same in programming, except the tools change frequently and depend a lot on in what domain you are working.\n\nIn Web development for example you're likely to use a lot of JavaScript. In other domains JS is making headway with Node.js but to me it's still not used as much. The other languages you mentioned (PHP, SQL) are that way as well. Most people don't consider HTML a programming language because you can't write a loop, there's no real control flow, etc. It is possible to \"modularize\" HTML though, so there's that. Nowadays though it seems like most people prefer to generate HTML rather than to code it by hand.\n\nAlso SQL is a very specialized language used to query a database. For example, what would \"hello world\" look like in SQL? Can you make a command-line app in SQL? Maybe it's technically possible, but I would not want to maintain such code if you gave it to me. I would much rather maintain the Python version of such a tool.",

That‚Äôs where the real learning kicks in.\n\nRead code, look at open-source projects on GitHub and try to understand how other people structure and write their code.\n\nWrite code every day, even if it‚Äôs 30 minutes as Momentum beats motivation.\n\nAccept that discomfort is normal, feeling lost is part of the process, every dev has gone through this.\n\nAnd no, you‚Äôre not useless because you used GPT, you‚Äôre resourceful! The goal isn‚Äôt to memorize everything, it‚Äôs to solve problems, and you did that... that‚Äôs being a developer!\n\nStick with it, you‚Äôve already come this far, this is just the next step in the journey.\n\nYou can absolutely improve with effort, just keep showing up, you‚Äôve definitely got this!",

Yes, it's cumbersome and annoying, but it pays off.\n\nMost importantly: Code. No matter what. If you ain't got nothing else write a hello world program. Change the code, experiment with it. Yes, I read that you're a CSE grad, but you need the experience and especially the feeling and confidence that comes with it.\n\nAnd then learn to read documentation and references instead of googling. Your code looks like Python. So go ahead and read through the whole Python reference. You don't need to memorize it, and you can skip through stuff, but make sure you read all the function names and at least a little bit of what they do, and it will help you a lot to get some confidence and a starting point if you're looking for something. After that, pick some \"most used libraries\" (feel free to google it) and read a few examples for each, or the reference docs if you can afford to.\n\nThere's no easy way, you have to go ahead and invest the time and brain cells. Again, it's not about memorizing everything, but having read stuff at least once will give you a better feeling for a language, what to find where, where to start, and some confidence.\n\nGood luck, I think the thing you're most lacking right now is confidence, and there ain't no better way to establish that than knowing that you worked hard.",

It's unproductive, disruptive and will likely cause you to make strange learning decisions instead of rightly pursuing what is relevant or interesting to you. It is a journey and you should celebrate your milestones, even the little ones, rather than wasting energy by lamenting the fact that you haven't magically become a programming savant overnight.\n\nIt's a marathon, not a sprint, do not burn yourself out trying to 'catch up', but do be diligent as there's more than enough to distract us all these days. Anything you learn, even if not immediately applicable, is very rarely a waste of learning.\n\nLastly and probably most challengingly, really reflect on that hatred for maths. Maths is a lot like programming in that, for the most part, it's dozens if not hundreds of fairly straightforward concepts all stacked on top of each other and its the concepts you misunderstand / misapply that trip you up. If you dislike maths I'd have a good think about whether you dislike actually puzzling over it or whether your education system has constantly thrown you challenges beyond your comfort level and never given you the chance and support to address your weaker spots.\n\nSome actual learning advice / resources:\n\nOn the maths front, Engineering Mathematics by K.A. Stroud is my top pick for a zero to hero maths book if it's of interest as it really starts from the fundamentals.\n\nIf you like Python, automate the boring stuff with python is a fantastic resource, available as a website, courses on Udemy, a book, whatever floats your boat.\n\nOutside of that, honestly just do some coding puzzles online. Codingbat, codingames, codewars and loads more. Leetcode is there too but is probably best left for later once you're feeling up to it.\n\n3 months to do some well directed self study is gold.

Something down the line needs to be written in machine code so that the computer can understand everything else that we write in human code, right?\n\nThe OS is not **written** in binary code. But because it is **compiled** to binary code, which the CPU directly understands, there doesn't need to be any other layer \"underneath\" it.\n\nThe compiler, too, can be written in a high-level language which is compiled to machine code.\n\n> Or are these fundamental softwares written in high-level languages on an already functioning computer and then compiled down to machine code which gets installed on a new computer? \n\nYes, this is basically it. You can compile an OS, and you can also compile a compiler, but you have to have an existing compiler to do this. So there's a *historical* question of where these compilers came from. And the basic answer is that if you were starting from absolutely nothing, you would have to work your way up from very simple compilers/assemblers, and use those to compile more complex ones.\n\nFor instance, you start out with a system that has no assembler at all. It only understands raw binary machine code, fed to it using some input method. This might be a paper tape reader, or a punched card reader, or toggle switches that let you manually enter data one bit/byte at a time.\n\nThen you write an assembler in machine code, and feed it to the computer. Now you can write programs in assembly code instead of machine code. Then you can write a C compiler in assembly language. And so on.\n\nOnce you have a C compiler, you can rewrite that compiler in C instead of assembly, so that it's easier to maintain. And then it can compile new versions of itself. This is called [\"self-hosting\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_%28compilers%29).\n\nBut remember, this is a *historical* account of how programming languages were \"bootstrapped\" over the last 70 years or so. Once you have a self-hosting compiler, you no longer need all of the previous layers of bootstrapping.",

It's what the CPU understands, by definition.\n\nGenerally the process goes something like this:\n\n1. You write source code: C, C++, Rust, Java, C#, Python, whatever.\n2. The frontend translates it into some machine oriented but still cross platform instruction set. It's usually called bytecode or intermediate representation or pcode or something like that.\n3. The backend eats the intermediate code and gives actual CPU instructions for your hardware.\n\nIntroductory programming classes love to obsess over whether a language is \"compiled\" or \"interpreted\" but there hasn't been a difference for decades, if there ever was. People just say it's \"interpreted\" if the whole 3 step process normally happens at runtime. It's all going to machine language through some intermediate regardless.\n\nA lot of code expects to be executed in the presence of an operating system which is kind of hard to depend on if you're writing the OS in the first place. So we may have to talk about \"free-standing\" versus \"hosted\" environments if we want to make our operating system, and yes, we're more likely to talk about that in the context of a language like C that's widely used both ways and even enshrines the difference in its specification.\n\nBut the real reason C and C++ (and increasingly Rust) are used for OS development is that they give you tight control over how you use memory, and there's a well established tradition of actually using that control to do things people don't typically expect to lean on other languages for. You can grab at arbitrary bytes of memory through pointers and do things that might be \"undefined\" i.e. specific to your hardware and your compiler. A lot of other languages expect that some kind of runtime environment is running under the hood, maybe including a garbage collector that cleans up memory for you, so it's more like the language tries to bring along all this infrastructure that you might want to implement yourself or do without.\n\nAlso you've got to keep in mind that there are many different levels of writing an OS. There's the kernel which can be complicated in its own right. Then there can be lots of drivers, utilities, shells, and built-in apps. A lot of the \"OS\" might be more or less just normal application code running in a hosted environment. That stuff can be written in anything, so a whole OS is not necessarily written in just one language. For example, Google did a huge project to try to start writing more of Android in Java, Kotlin, and Rust a while back, though there is still a lot of C and C++ in it. IIRC Android 13 was the first version to be less than 50% C and C++. (Edit: They were less than 50% in [new code](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/memory-safe-languages-in-android-13.html?m=1) that version.)\n\nThe point is it's all machine code in the end. The only question is if the language is accustomed to letting you do practically everything the machine code will allow, or whether you would be fighting the language's built-in assumptions to implement the OS's most basic functionality for yourself.",

Computer hardware and software is largely designed as a big old stack of layers, and understanding roughly what they are will help you understand things tremendously.\n\nIn this case, the bit you are missing is that a computer program, once compiled, is already machine code. You write a program as a text file, the format of which is the C programming language. A special program, a C compiler, takes in this text file as input and outputs a file that contains the machine code that is equivalent to what you wrote.\n\nWhen you tell the operating system to run the program, it reads the file and puts the machine code section of it somewhere in memory, then points the CPU to that spot in memory and says \"run the machine code at this address.\" The computer hardware, which knows how to run machine code, takes it from there.\n\nThe operating system itself works the same way. You write the operating system as a C program. A C compiler compiles the operating system into machine code. That machine code gets shoved into the spot where the hardware expects the operating system to be (let's ignore how that works for the moment), and so when the computer starts, it finds some machine code and runs it.\n\nEven the C compiler works the same way! You write the compiler in C, then you turn it into machine code by running it through an existing C compiler, and now you have a nice new C compiler. You may ask \"well, where did the first C compiler come from, then?\" and that would be a great question.

Eventually, it became self hosting such that a C compiler written in B could produce a C compiler which could compile itself, producing a C compiler written in C.\n\nThe first B compiler was written in TMG, and the first TMG compiler was hand assembled using the TMG compiler specification. In other words, that compiler was written in assembly, but it was written in such a way as if it had compiled itself.\n\n>Is there something beneath that? The BIOS?

That's a different beast all to itself that programmers rarely ever need to worry about.\n\nBIOS is just a name for the startup routine and machine interface used by IBM PCs. It's usually specific to a particular motherboard and has the ultimate objective of finding and loading an operating system bootloader. BIOS has been depreciated in favor of UEFI. All modern operating systems generally shutdown firmware services and make little use of them, preferring their own drivers instead.\n\n>Or are these fundamental softwares written in high-level languages on an already functioning computer and then compiled down to machine code which gets installed on a new computer?\n\nC code that is compiled as a part of an operating system kernel and C code that is compiled as a part of a userspace application are no different. instructions are instructions.",

They exist to manage hardware and memory resources and provide them to running programs that they organize into processes and threads. A system call is when a hosted program asks the OS for something the OS has sole control over like access to the file system, a network peripheral, or the display. If you want to write an OS, part of what you‚Äôre doing is creating that management layer and providing entry points to ask for access.\n\nOn machine code. If you want to know what that really is, it‚Äôs a combination of an operation code and operands. The operation code is a number representing an operation like add or and or left shift or in complex instruction sets like x86 things like moving memory around. The operands can be the numbers of temp storage registers, a memory address, or a literal number. These enter a circular buffer of registers in the cpu and feed physical mux (input selector) components that route the operation to the appropriate physical hardware and open the correct operand supplier gates so it processes the right data. It‚Äôs more complicated than that. Look up stuff like branch predictors and the Tomasulo algorithm for examples of doing multiple things at the same time and simulating in order execution. But, machine code contains the literal control switch positions to run the cpu hardware for a given clock cycle or two. It‚Äôs the only thing the cpu actually understands.\n\nAlso, if you would like to viscerally experience self hosting compilers without much effort, there‚Äôs a Linux distribution called Gentoo which is irrationally interested in building everything from source. Setting it up takes days though a lot of that is waiting. You take a bootstrap configuration, build a customizable OS kernel for your exact hardware, and then experience using the supplied copy of the GCC c compiler to compile well everything in all its open source source file glory. Often you end up using the out of date copy of GCC to compile an updated version of GCC and GCLIB (and holy hell that takes all night sometimes). Now any rational person will tell you that there is absolutely no reason to build all this stuff from source yourself when the build command you‚Äôre using is the standard ‚Äúgcc -o2 [whatever]‚Äù that built the compiled binary distributions, but if you‚Äôd like to see it, you can. Btw, I know this because I had a friend who told me that if I really wanted to learn Linux I‚Äôd do this. He was wrong about that.",

The difference is just what you need it for. The biggest thing you need to get comfortable doing is breaking things down into smaller steps. Say you've got a project in mind, something simple like making a little calculator app with HTML and JavaScript. Maybe you don't know how to do this at all. Well, how do you break that down? You need a webpage with buttons and display, and you need some JaveScript to do some work for you. So, how do you make a webpage? You can look that up. See what HTML is and how to use it. Then you can design a really simple looking calculator. How do you get javascript running on a web page? Look it up. It's simple, but you won't know without looking it up first. Then, how do you get javascript to know when you press something? How do you get javascript to change the display somewhere? You can look these up, and suddenly you know what you need to make the app. Now it's just a matter of making some simple functions to do your calculator's math and you've got something you can be proud of.\n\n  \nThe trick is, look up how to do the concept, not the specifics. So, don't look up \"JS how to add 3 + 5\", look up \"JS how to add two numbers.\" Then apply it to your situation. You get a little thinking involved, and you get a little better. Keep at it and it won't be too long before that kind of stuff is easy and you're struggling with harder things. And APIs? You'll always have to look those up. Not because you won't understand them, but because the specifics are always unique to whatever you're doing.",

They are really not that helpful at the stage I am at. Normally I go through the following, roughly in order: \n\n1. Libraries. Most projects require (or are made significantly easier) by using libraries. I start by looking up what is available, because that gives me an idea both about the problem, and about how people normally go about solving it. \n\n2. Documentation. When I have decided for a library to start with, I go over it's documentation. I specifically look for setup and \"first steps\", but everything that seems remotely interesting I will take a quick glance at. \n\n3. Forums, Blog Posts, Stackoverflow. At this stage I will probably have some questions, so I look for people who have either had the same questions and found answers, or I will look for blog posts trying to explain it. This is the only stage where I sometimes use AI, but very very rarely. I have gotten pretty good at getting to the answers with classical search engines, and getting the answers that way is normally better, since I stumble upon a lot of other information that might prove useful later.   \nAnother important skill is to find good blog posts. I blocked [medium.com](http://medium.com) completely in my browser, since it's just 95% time wasting blogs that copy and paste directly from the documentation in order to farm clicks. Self hosted blogs, especially those with a long history of similar topics, are the best. Reddit ranks somewhere in the middle. \n\nAnd the most interesting links get bookmarked and downloaded for offline viewing, especially all documentation I need. There will never be a stage where you know all of this by heart, the best thing you can do is make sure you keep access to it, even without the internet, and you should know where the information you need is located.",

That makes the mapping (or function, in the mathematical sense) from inputs to outputs much easier to formally describe and specify.

If you want to prove that a component will always behave a certain way, then you have to prove it for all possible orderings of operations. This tends to give you a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. It's not impossible to prove these sorts of properties, but it's something that you don't have to worry about if the component is stateless.\n\nUsually, an application *needs* to have state, in order to do what you want it to do. But by confining the state to the smallest possible \"region\" of the program, you make the both the stateful parts and the stateless parts easier to reason about, compared to how it would be if mutable state was woven throughout the program.\n\nJust as one specific example of this, programs that make heavy use of mutable global variables tend to be much harder to understand and maintain than those that pass parameters and return values around wherever they're needed.",

If it's possible to just substitute values into a computation to get an answer, it's very easy (in theory) to see where something is wrong. Once you introduce the idea that time matters, e.g. a value can be different at different points in time depending on what point a machine (of some description) is at in the computation, it starts to get much harder to debug things. Now imagine a large program/system with millions of bits of state, changing frequently. If the code doesn't produce the desired behaviour for some combination of those states, you have a bug, and it can be very hard to track down.\n2. Following on from the above, in the context of OOP vs Functional paradigms, OOP is (most agree) about associating behaviour with data. Grouping state with the code that changes it, usually modelled after some real-world thing (but not necessarily). In this way it encourages statefulness and mutation of state. It attempts to balance this with encapsulation (usually enforced at compile time), so that only certain code can access certain state. But that code is called by other code, so the positive effect of this can be limited. Contrasted with functional, where we try to write as much of the program without depending on state, meaning functions become \"pure\" (no reliance on state, no side effects, etc.). We need side effects and state changes, it's what we sell to customers, but we can push them to the very edges of the program, and wall off code that handles the messy stuff, hopefully making the rest easier to reason about and less prone to bugs. Just like OOP there is a spectrum. You can dip your toes in, or go full on.\n\nEdit, just seen you added 3. Think I basically covered it though so I'll leave it there for now. Also, interestingly, some languages are now turning off statefulness by default and having you opt into it, e.g. Rust with mut to enable assignment (distinct from initialising the value)",

But that doesn't hold for the text editor - when you load a text to edit, you don't set the state of the entire application, only the \"data-model\" that it manipulates. All the rules, all the behaviour of the program would be the same as if any other text had been loaded, and thus not directly affecting the state. The state would be like if part of the text was selected, or a dialog window was opened, or a context-menu was active.\n\nStatefulness isn't necessarily considered bad - but the more states you have, the higher complexity you are dealing with, and the higher the risk for unexpected behaviour. If you have 32 variables that can all impact the operation of the application in different ways, you have 4 billion variations, and you can't possibly test every single one of them. So the less statefulness the better.\n\nOOP can encourage statefulness because it encourages objects to be able to manipulate themselves, and store their data, i.e. their state internally. An object \"remembers\" what happened to it the last time you called some method, and behaves differently the next time, depending on previous method-calls. Pure functions do not alter their behaviour depending on state - they always behave the exact same.\n\nStatelessness is preferred because that means that the application always behaves the exact same, and always in a predictable way, thus errors can't suddenly happen when a previous un-encountered state occurs. If new errors are found, they happen because of specific input, and it can be replicated and fixed. Whereas when errors happen in stateful applications, you might not be able to replicate the exact circumstances that caused the error.\n\nAt least that is what we hope and wish for - but of course states can't be completely eliminated, and errors and bugs still show up from time to time in any kind of application.",

        "body": "2 first:  Objects are *data and their operations*.  State is the definition of an object in the OOP sense.\n\n1 and 3:  Stateless operations are trivially parallelizable and for practical purposes obviate the memory bus part of the architecture to focus on control flow and data transformation.\n\nLet us back up a little:  Fundamentally every program is a transformation of data.  At all scales, this is what a program is.  From the macro to the function level, a program / routine / subroutine/ function, has input, performs a transformation, and provides output.  The \"provides transformation and provides output\" is the key part.  This is true even in places where it's somewhat unexpected:  Gluing APIs together is largely taking the data from one API, performing a transformation, and then outputting it to a second API.\n\nThis is the underlying premise for microservices, for instance.  They perform a single small transformation on data and output it for the next consumer.\n\nNow, let's consider a matrix consisting of all stateful branches.  This is a little opaque to think about at first, so I'll give a concrete example:  In NetHack you can mix potions, or pour potions on items, drink them, etc, and essentially do any X to any item and any potion that you can do with *any other item*.  If you have a matrix where all items are represented as rows, and the behavior of an item interacting with another item is defined by a function entry in that matrix, then you can see that the number of interactions and state transformations of the data grows exponentially with each item (for n-items it's n\\^2 possible state transformations).\n\nIt is possible to show that all stateful operations in a program can be represented this way, and so the complexity of a program grows exponentially as the number of possible distinct state-branches it can take on a given stateful object grows.\n\nSome programs, and some styles of programming (especially game programming) typically lend themselves to managing and processing large amounts of state.  With a resulting large amount of bugs.  It is difficult and takes a lot of engineering work to parallelize that in a consistent and meaningful way, and there are multiple approaches to doing so (the most ubiquitous in my experience has literally been writing your own IPC layer... jfc I hate game devs).\n\nThe graphics pipeline can nominally be viewed as a (mostly) stateless series of programs.  Ignoring some advanced counterexamples, vertex and pixel shaders inherently take input, provide output, and never operate on state at all.  But this isn't quite completely stateless, because the graphics card / driver has a set of states that you have to set for those programs to operate the intended way.  It has *minimal* state, but is not entirely stateless.\n\nThat minimal state affecting control and inputs though minimizes the difficulty in parallelizing shader operations, and once configured globally the programs are trivially parallelizable.\n\nSo, statefulness is \"bad\" from a philosophy of programming perspective where an increase in state and the number of transformations on that state increases the complexity of a program quadratically and decreases the composability and functional-ness of the program.  OOP is by definition state and operations.\n\nBUT, the truth is that some programs require state, and/or are easier to reason about statefully.  And where the rubber meets the road, you do what you need to do to get the data tranformed correctly and within acceptable external tolerances.\n\nEd: I forgot to address the side-effects problem.  State implies functions have side effects to transform persistent state.  That's the entire point of functions on persistent state.  Side-effects can sometimes be very hard to see or understand, making it harder to reason about complex programs (duh) and breaking data/transformation locality.",

Code that tries too hard to separate every little thing into a function is often much more taxing to read. It depends what you're writing. Long functions aren't intrinsically bad. Minor idealism.\n\nIn 7, avoiding unnecessary assignment is fine and can be very beneficial, but this is getting into the functional realm a bit. In other styles/paradigms, and in practice, assignments are often done for readability where there wouldn't otherwise be a need to create a local to hold temporary state for the computation. Again, depends how general you're looking to be with these rules. Same with 8. Lots of useful functions will never be deterministic. E.g. a function that timestamps something couldn't be considered good here. This works fine for canned computation but can break down in real software.\n\n9 also has lots of exceptions. There are many reasons you may want an infinite loop and you rely on them often without realising. Yes, you probably don't want to write one very often in general application dev. It's more important that infinite loops don't block event loops, UI threads, don't spin-lock (unless you intend) a core, and that when errors occur in code that runs as part of the loop, they're handled properly (e.g. recovery if possible/desired) or the process exits, or device is reset etc. Sometimes there is no useful work to do outside of a loop, the whole program is a big loop, etc.\n\nI'd add:\n\n\\- Function is necessary and worth the extra code. Compilers are pretty good at inlining but that doesn't help me reading the code. E.g. You rarely need to pull a single operation into a function (e.g. n << 1) or something. Just write it in place.\n\n\\- Function interface is fully documented. This includes types of inputs/outputs, and full details of any possible exceptions (and their types), behaviour on error, error codes etc., what behaviour is defined/undefined for given states. Reentrancy (if it isn't, e.g. stores state elsewhere!), thread safety (if it isn't). Locks it will take on resources etc...\n\n\\- Function output params are reasonably obvious too (not just input params).\n\n\\- Function code is all roughly the same level of abstraction. E.g. a syscall (or C library call for a syscall) in the middle of some UI object method that handles a button click would likely be unexpected...",

Although the main way to control for maintainability and correctness should actually be the testsuite.\n\nSure we can observe various attributes that functions tend to have in a maintainable and largely correct codebase. And I think you hit some good points, but for many of these points I would actually say there is a 80%/20% or 90%/10% rule, etc.  \nFor example, X% of functions should be deterministic and Y% should be non-deterministic. And X% of functions should always terminate and Y% should loop forever.\n\nFor example, when using the actor model, it is expected and useful to have exactly one forever-looping function (with exception of its shutdown mechanism) per actor. It would make sense to have all the other functions guaranteed to terminate. For other paradigms, the rules should be different.  \nIn async based projects for example, it makes sense to have rules when a function is allowed to be async. Many projects make all (or most) of their functions async by default, but that actually tends to introduce unneeded complexity. Limiting stuff like this requires a bit more thought when creating the system, but saves a lot of time on maintaining, debugging, and refactoring later.",

Learning takes time, so you must also learn to become process-oriented by finding ways to make that time rewarding as opposed to being goal-oriented and only caring about the final outcome, because the latter gives you very little in terms of experience which is what you should be taking out of your learning journey. Yes, researching how to build everything from scratch takes a very long time in the beginning, but as you gain experience, the need to do that will diminish, you will gain intuition, and over time you will build a strong knowledge foundation that will serve you much better in the long run than the brittle thing that you will build if you keep approaching learning with your current mindset. You don't need to go any deeper than the public instruction set native to your computer as below that one can hardly call it programming, but in the beginning you should really aim at forming a strong notion of how things really work all the way down there.\n\n> My question is: How do you usually learn about the tools, libraries, or techniques that already exist, so you don‚Äôt waste time building everything from scratch? Is there a strategy or habit for this, or is it just experience over time?\n\nI don't. In personal projects I just learn everything from scratch, and enjoy the whole process, because the point is to learn, not to finish the project, and the time spent learning isn't really wasted time. As a beginner to some technology there's also a very high chance that my first approach to solving the problem will likely be a mess so it won't be of much use, so that's never my goal. Lastly it's also very likely that, in the research process required to actually learn how things work, I will come across existing projects that already do it right, but instead of cheating my way by just taking advantage of the existing solution I go down the rabbit hole and try to wrap my head around the rationale of that solution, and don't consider the problem solved until I successfully tackle it myself.\n\nMy advice to you is to stop coming up with excuses to avoid learning when that's exactly what you should be doing. High-level development might feel rewarding to you because it gives you the impression that you are accomplishing a lot with very little, but in the end you are also only gaining a superficial experience, and without a solid foundation it's very easy for abstractions to create unexpected complex problems that you lack the intuition to solve on your own, so don't cheat your way out of the learning process. With large language machine learning models you have free access to teachers that can easily break down complex concepts for you and never get tired of answering your requests to explain things from different perspectives, which is a commodity that I didn't get to enjoy during most of my career, so definitely take advantage of that, not to write your code ant cheat your way out of problems, but to truly help you wrap your head around the solutions.",

Martin.** Strengths: an excellent guide to writing code that is readable, maintainable, changeable, and testable; includes tons of examples, so instead of getting just a list of \"rules\" to follow, you get to see how to iteratively improve code, step by step. Weaknesses: has taken a lot of flak recently for some of the recommendations (e.g., very short functions), or perhaps due to hate for the author (who admittedly can be off putting), but I still think it's well-worth reading for all programmers; focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming.\n\n* **_A Philosophy of Software Design_ by John Ousterhout.** Strengths: does a good job of defining complexity in software and the key causes of it; good discussions of information hiding, error handling, and conventions; contains some interesting counter-arguments to the practices in _Clean Code_, so it's good to read the books side-by-side. Weaknesses: focuses mostly on OO languages (C++, Java), with little mention of functional programming; the discussions of strategy vs tactics and trends felt a bit weak.\n\n* **_Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests_ by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.** Strengths: the best book I've seen on teaching you how to write automated tests; makes a compelling argument for how tests lead to better software design; includes many examples, and shows you how to use tests to iteratively produce better code. Weaknesses: the book focuses entirely on Java and OO, so yet again, functional programming is ignored; the book can get boring at times when it gets deep into the weeds of the Java Swing threading model.\n\n* **_Seven Languages in Seven Weeks_ by Bruce A. Tate.** Strengths: a fantastic way to get exposure to not only multiple different programming languages (Ruby, Haskell, Prolog, Io, Erlang, Clojure, Scala), but also multiple different programming paradigms (OO, functional programming, logic programming, meta programming, concurrency constructs, type systems), which is a terrific way to become a better programmer; lots of great exercises in the book that give you a taste of what makes each language and paradigm unique. Weaknesses: it's hard to be an expert in so many different languages, so some of the chapters are stronger than others.",

You end up picking a few things and trying those out first, then slowly add other ideas. \n\nYour priority should be readability first, then maybe make it efficient. Why? Some beginners (more true 30-40 years ago) believe the most efficient code is the best code. Maybe when computers were slow, this was important, but today, it's far less important.\n\nAlso, unless it's an algorithmic improvement, most programmers don't know what is causing their code to be inefficient. They make a guess, and hope that it works, but often, they can't tell a difference. The code runs fast to begin with and whatever fraction faster it runs is not even noticeable.\n\nSo, readability first. You may think coding is for computers, but it's also for humans. When you opt to make things run fast or use less memory, then you write code that's harder to read. Others will find your code confusing.\n\nMy advice is to learn how to write good function and variable names. This is not at all easy. But good names act as documentation. Many developers are lazy when it comes to documentation. They find it a waste of time. At the very least, getting good function/variable names does improve readability.\n\nYou can see beginners opting to pick variable names like `x, y, z` because they struggle to come up with good names.\n\nThere's this idea that functions are meant to reuse code. That's true, but it can also be used as a kind of documentation.\n\nFor example, I encountered something similar to the following:\n\n    code == 10 || code == 12 || code == 30\n\nLet's say these codes indicate someone is tax-exempt internally in the database. They serve as a classification of the person's status, and numbers are used to be precise.\n\nIt would read better as\n\n       boolean hasTaxExemptStatus(int taxCode) {\n          return taxCode == 10 || taxCode == 12 \n                   || taxCode == 30;\n      }\n\nEven if you only call that function once, it makes it clearer. I was originally going to call this `isTaxExempt`, but I renamed it to `hasTaxExemptStatus` because that felt more accurate to me.\n\nThe other common tip is: DRY. Don't Repeat Yourself.\n\nIf you see yourself copying-pasting the same code over and over, then make it into a function and refactor all of that code.\n\nThere are other more sophisticated tips, but I'd say start with those two.",

Check if the letter has already been used. Pick a word from a dictionary. Check if the letter is in the word etc...\n\n  \nIt took me far too long to learn that the assignment wasn't about a hangman game, it was a lesson showing how to split big problems in to small ones. Every step was laughably easy and suddenly I had a silly little game to show for it.  If you ask me to build almost anything, I'll be at a loss. But I have got a bit better at biting off small chunks and doing those.\n\n  \nAs another poster said, pseudo code is good.

I have *no idea* how to do that. But I know I need to start with reading my music library. And I don't want to do that every time I run, so I want to store that somewhere and rerun periodically (either to a file or database). So I need to think about whether I want to write data to file or database, and figure out how to do that. And I want to take in some parameters for the playlist, but I can do that from  a config file of some sort for now. And I'll want to pick a set of tracks which match my params - can't be that hard. Then I need to randomly pick some, and maybe randomise the order. Hmm, maybe I should try and limit the number of tracks from any one artist, or maximise it - that may be a nice parameter. I'll need to know the standard playlist format. Etc etc.\n\nSuddenly the whole project seems like something you could do in a weekend. Which makes me wonder why I haven't gotten around to it in the past year... although in that time I have written some code that gives me some nice data on my music library, and lets me do some housekeeping and cleanup on it.",

That one skill, the ability to read and write code is a big chunk of what makes a good programmer.\n\nNow why students tend to struggle with this is because, firstly this is actually hard to do, so they tend to cheat and just do lots of copy and paste, telling themselves they are learning.\n\nBut there are no shortcuts. To get good at programming requires being good at reading and writing code and that can only be learned by typing in all the code by hand and then trying to understand what was typed. And this requires weeks if not months of repetition (i.e. write lots and lots of code).\n\nAnd you don't need to go looking for some magic project to code. Stick to the basics and learn to write for loops, if statements, control statements, functions and procedures, read user input, echo that input, read for file, write to a file, access a database, read from a socket, write to a socket, spawn a process, capture its output etc. etc.\n\nAnd even using AI should not be an issue, but if all you are doing is using the AI code directly you will not be learning anything. If you use AI take the code it writes and type all of that code in by hand, then study the code to understand what it is doing. No copy and paste, no shortcuts.\n\nUsing that process you will be learning to write code and learning to read code. Add to that reading a good book on your programming language and you'll be well on your way to becoming a good programmer.",

I did allot of errors while learning and one of them is to rely on toturials they trick ur brain to think u know stuff but in reality u don't, u have to build stuff on ur own after studying .\nSorry for the long paragraph , good luck\nEdit: I forgot to mention, search for the Odin project, it is very good",

Like literally block a few hours and do the reading. It's work just like typing code is work. \n\nClose your AI tabs. Writing code, especially code that you know the structure of, is a restful activity that lets your mind go through the project. letting something generate your code makes it harder to know what is going on in the project and it pushes you into constant \"debug someone elses mess\" territory. ownership of code starts with having written it.

Research on your own and start somewhere. For your level and usecase it should be something cheap/free without the possibility of draining your life savings if you make a mistake. Look into a VPS and docker  \n\\- Scaling? A lot of the things in the cloud these days autoscale in their own ways. But don't worry about this at all atm. You won't build anything that needs serious scaling for a long time probably.  \n\\- Security? This one is kinda the odd one out. Security is a CORE part of any app, not just an afterthought. Another reason why you are not \"fairly proficient\". This needs to be understood and studied on a core level.  \n\\- Architecture? This can mean anything  \n\\- How to choose a tech stack?

So for example you build a simple application, then host it, extend it to use authentication and integrate with something like google.  Add something like accessing a database and learn how to deploy the database.  This is just an example of how to build out what started as a simple application.\n\nThe first time you do something, it may not be the best, but you will learn.  The next time you can try changing things to compare until you find a method that works for you.

A great way to write programs is to solve problems you run into.\n\nFor instance, I work at a printer dealership. The software we use for tracking service tickets is 26 years old, takes several minutes to boot up, is insanely expensive, and is unintuitive and generally clunky. Maybe I'm audacious, but I became convinced I could do better. So now I'm writing a tool that does it better. It's been months and I'm nowhere near done, because I keep learning and refactoring and learning and refactoring... which is how I hit my stride.

It drives, your code is along for the ride.\n\nGame engine - Basically a framework for making games. It drives. It allows you to provide code that uses or conforms to certain interfaces to customise its behaviour to make your game. Types, events, utilities, all the hard physics math, all the hard graphics math, all the finicky parsing code for data formats, the platform layer that takes input and interfaces with the OS, etc... all done for you.\n\nSDL describes itself as a library, and I agree having used it extensively. You bring the game/sim loop, and basically everything else. You call it to get input, or ask about events, or render something (if you're using it to render). It's basically a cross-platform platform layer that you can build a game engine (or whatever you like) on top of. It doesn't ask you to write your whole app in various callbacks in a very opinionated way etc.",

        "body": "Let's first define what inversion of control (IoC) is so people can understand why this is a good definition for frameworks (if you ever used one).  \n\nThe best analogy I have ever read for IoC is a breadboard that one uses in an electronics project.  The easiest example of a breadboard is one with a single input of DC current and a ground, aka a simple circuit.  Along the path of the current you can add devices to split it, devices to merge it, devices to redirect or terminate it, or devices to do something like making a beep sound.  We can think of the point where we apply the current as input and the ground as output but it doesn't matter because you can think of the ground just another device that kills the current while doing something else.  The key is the input.  \n\nWhat a framework is someone giving you a breadboard with all the wiring done for you and telling you that you have device A, B, C, etc. that can do X, Y, Z respectively and the final result is G (ground).  \n\nThis is how many JS web frameworks work, the circuit is designed for you with a few switches here and there but your primary job is to insert your devices at various spots (aka put in hour data and code).   The point is all the logic is worked out for you so you can just ***plug and play***.  \n\nA library is more like an auto-mechanic's toolbox.  It is a set of tools (or APIs) that are related for accomplishing a set of related tasks.  A good example of this in JS is JQuery.  They are typically very specific uses and very tiny.  You have to know each tool in the box well to really make it shine.  SDL is a library because it mainly provides a thin layer allowing you to manipulate the hardware through an abstraction layer.  \n\nA game engine is a very complicated IoC with a bunch of tools in a library that allows you to manipulate the breadboard so to speak so that you can write your own breadboard logic.  Of course it also has something like SDL for controlling the hardware.  \n\nIn general, unless you are paid to do something using either a framework or an engine, you should avoid wasting time on them.  They are hard to generalize and hard to learn because you have to learn the underlying rules and logic.  Learning them is like learning how the internal of Window works just so you can use a browser on your computer.  You should aim to learn through libraries and the smaller the better because then you can figure out how to write and modify them if you ever need to.",

You might only use a subset of it's functionality, and you might change libraries if one isn't working for you etc. (provided you've achieved loose coupling)\n\nFrameworks are more fundamental to your app. You won't change framework, you'll rewrite the app if you do. Think of the browser and its DOM and JS API. It handles the JS event loop, and fires events. The interface it presents you is that it will read and run your code on page load, and if you happen to attach any listeners to targets it will run your custom code when events happen on those targets. Frameworks are like this. When your problem is the problem they're built to solve everything is great, and when you need to do something bespoke, it can be very difficult unless the framework provides some escape hatch. E.g. When Angular 1 was popular it had two-way binding, and you very much had to write your front end \"the angular way\" to keep everything in it's digest cycle (or whatever, it's been 10 years) or it wouldn't know state had changed etc. Digging into the same page with jquery often backfired.",

Pick the language of your choice\n3. Finish all exercises. At least try to make 75% progress.

Go to [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)\n2. Pick an interesting stuff to build (e.g. Emulator > C > \"Writing a game boy emulator\")\n3. Follow and complete the introductory tutorial and try to expand with more features\n\nThe paid way:\n\n1. Create an account on [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io)\n2. Pick a challenge (e.g. \"Build an interpreter from scratch\")\n3. Pick a language (e.g. C)\n4. Follow the instructions\n\nIt's 30$ per month though, so you gotta be committed asf and make the most of it: don't just blindly complete the challenges or worse: slack off. Read docs, engage in the community, get your project reviewed by someone, make sure you thoroughly understand the tool you just built (beyond the source code that you write).\n\nThird step: personal projects\n\nSurely there are plenty of things you want to do... If nothing comes to your mind right now, then hopefully the 3-6 months you just spent on Exercism+codecrafters gave you lots of ideas. But either way, try to do something without guidance.\n\nAfter all that, try to maybe contribute your own bugfixes or features on a GitHub repo that you love. Maybe during your learning journey, you spotted a nice game engine project and you want to participate in its development. The entire world is yours to discover at this point!",

Think about what you can do to move you closer to the solution. Doing this for complex problems requires experience, so start with simple problems that you can solve with your experience. Do it for years and it becomes a natural way to approach problems.\n\nThis is what you do every morning when you plan out your day. If you have a meeting at 10:00, and it takes you 20 minutes to get there, you need to leave at 9:40.

But, it also changes the time calculation since you need to go to post office, spend five minutes there, then go to meeting.\n\nSo, IF you go to the post office THEN add time for travel to it, time at it, and travel from post office to meeting. ELSE you don‚Äôt go to post office and simply add the travel time to meeting.\n\nHave other errands to run in addition to, or instead of, the post office? Similar logic, but applied to the trip to post office instead of the meeting. This introduces looping as you work back from your 10:00 and loop through your errands leading up to it. Get to the point where you would need to have left half an hour ago? Some errand needs to be removed‚Ä¶then you need an algorithm to decide which one to do later, or to reschedule the meeting. That can similarly be broken down.\n\nIt may seem very tedious, but this is how complex decisions are made. You take all the variables and conditions into account, at whatever level of detail is required to give an adequate solution. Maybe you are just meeting a friend for a walk in the park, and it‚Äôs ok to be a few minutes late, whereas for a job interview you must be on time, and add a few minutes buffer in case traffic delays you.\n\nIt is tedious. Very tedious. Encapsulation helps with this by focusing on the smallest set of details for the immediate problem at hand.\n\nDecompose problems into manageable encapsulations and build up from there.

The users were happy, the people who wrote that trash were not. I was never able to achieve 100x RTIs, which was disappointing. One needs to develop a design and methods instinct. The computer is a machine and you need to consider what you are making it do.\n\nAt the time, the technical computing group was charging served departments for machine cycles, there was complete reorg because that model was blown up. I was challenged by my boss/idiot that the users were not using my software suite, the cpu use was so little. I took him to my desk and beat up one of the memory resident apps and did a bunch of scrolling, sorting, editing etc and pointed to a little bug in the corner of the screen showing session use of a few milliseconds. The data was in permanent swap space, memory resident in permanent disk swap space. The screen apps were actually an interface to edit and manipulate data in address space. There were no database calls which are all subroutine calls. When a app was launched the app instantly had data in its address space. All supported by an optimized library of reentrant code. Many people running several apps were supported by a single instance of the code in memory. RAM was very expensive at that point in time. There were table driven applications generators with terminal screen forms and fields. When doing some complex products built on top of this, the full screen app could be used to examine the address space of the product being developed, an optimal debugging tool. Things like optimizing pen plotters and manufacturing numerically controlled devices, minimizing pen changes and tool transit paths. In the pen plotters, overlapping line vectors were collapsed to one. Vectors were grouped into several regions which reduced pen-up excursions. The problem is that during CAD design, a component would be given a bill of material number and the bill of material in the corner would be completed. During plotting, the plotter would retrace those motions in the order of the drawing development. A hole in a part would have two or more overlapping circles, from each surface that the hole went through. So there were such challenges. The software did such operations in the background, the users did not need to run anything. My background was MechEng.\n\nI examined each code component's compiler machine code output, optimizing register use in each subroutine, especially anything data intensive. Without using files for data, I had to produce my own data sorting, printing,  select etc. My equal key stable sorting was vastly faster than the OS sorting or SyncSort. The code included terminal drivers and supported a number of different models and brands of terminals within the one code base. Everything was coded in Fortran, however I was coding in other platforms and languages as needed.",

Whatever you do, find a leader you trust to talk to.\n\nThen you can add in some sort of counseling or vent-based release protocol for handling the *feeling of not feeling worthy or competent* because that is a whole different introspective beast.\n\nIf and when you do have this talk, compartmentalize. Minimize the ‚ÄúI feel‚Äù statements. Focus on objective problems that you are having.\n\n\nI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware of most of this, but take it from someone who has struggled immensely at multiple levels and has had substantial technical and research success in spite of that.\n\nTalk to your people. And when you‚Äôre done, make changes, and talk again.\n\nCheers",

It sounds like the course you're doing focuses on giving you solid fundamentals(although it is a bit weird that git/version control isn't a part of that), and you're supposed to build upon those fundamentals yourself. \nRealistically, just following a course and not doing any extra curricular learning yourself isn't good enough nowadays, if you want to get hired.\nThe good news is that you can change this. Ask yourself why you do programming? Is there a particular field you're drawn to? A passion you want to cultivate? Then prove it to yourself by actually studying and creating projects in that area in your spare time.\nIf you're not sure what you're passionate about, then at least try something and see what sticks.\nAs a personal example I never thought I would be interested in learning the really low level stuff until I came across a certain resource and then I just fell down a rabbit hole and allowed it to consume me.\nGood luck",

        "body": "Current CS major here who is still learning and finding cool resources outside of school:\n\nLooks like your programming skills are not a problem just a lack of familiarity with common tools. That is okay but you just need to play catch up. I suggest watching videos or following tutorials and actually practice using these tools like Git, Git Hub, Docker, etc as you mentioned but with a guide so you do not get lost. These seem hard but once you use them for a bit it gets easier. Even I struggle to understand new topics and tools but you got to push through and enjoy the grind.\n\nResources:\n\n1. After reading your post I feel this is the best resource as per the gaps in knowledge you state you want to fill. It looks like you want to get familiar with command line interfaces(CLI), Git and Git Hub(which are different things), and how node.js and Java Script programs work. I **highly recommend** [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) course(free/asynchronous) to get familiar with all these tools(Git, Git Hub, Java Script, node.js, HTML, CSS, not docker though). It is centered on web dev but since you want to get familiar with those tools and programing languages it is a great place to start. They break it down into sections with step by step on how to set up, what it is for, how to use with personal project based learning, you can ask for help on their Discord, and they provide links to additional readings.\n   1. I was also confused about Git and Git Hub less than a year ago but using The Odin Project made me understand it a lot better and why it is so useful. BTW heres an extra resource to practice Git commands after you get familiar with using it: [https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en\\_US](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US)\n2. You can also look into [CS50 on edx](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home) to practice general programming skills. It is also free and asynchronous but it has less focus on tools and more on thinking and problem solving which will only help you. They are lecture style with additional shorter videos and problem sets to solve.\n3. I see you also are a bit interested in game dev, if so follow tutorials for games on the Godot engine or even Unity or Game Maker. Anything really and do not feel bad about doing so especially if you have never used it. Of course do not just copy and paste from the video and try to take make it your own. Brackey's could be a good start but there are other great You Tube videos for game dev.\n\nI am not an expert but I would say you do not have to know everything but you have to get familiar with general tools. Of course when you get put into a project or land a job you may have to learn a new tool but if you get a sense of the generally popular tools needed for a specific project that will help you adapt.\n\nAll in all do no give up just keep going, acknowledge your lack of experience but build upon what you know and do not know.",

What steps did you do? Can you write it down step by step like you would do in algebra class? Now do it for \"MADAM\", etc. Now do it for a non-palindrome like \"MADMAN\". At what step in your process did you realize MADMAN was not a palindrome?\n\nNow can you write a general procedure for doing this? Luckily you have some test-cases already for palindromes and non-palindromes, so you can test your procedure and probably fix many bugs already.\n\nIf you want to get really \"serious\" about testing, then you can even take a break and write a separate program (not required, of course), that generates long palindromes and long non palindromes, and can use that as input to \"stress test\" your final procedure. For such a problem this is probably overkill, but for building an \"industrial strength\" library or program where there are strict performance requirements this kind of thing is often done.\n\nIn any case don't forget to test edge cases, for example is the empty string a palindrome? Maybe it's not defined anywhere, but as a programmer you have to handle that possibility appropriately, either by defining a safe default (e.g. \"\" IS or IS NOT a palindrome by arbitrary fiat) or else return an error, saying you need at least one character to determine palindromeness/palindromitivity.",

Most beginner programming problems are like this, I mean really everything is like this.\n\nSo like, the way you would check if ‚Äúracecar‚Äù is a palindrome (it is) would basically be to look at the first letter and see if it matches the last letter.  And then see if the 2nd letter matches the 2nd to last letter (and of course when I say ‚Äúletter‚Äù‚Ä¶ I guess I should be saying character, if it should be able to handle anything that is technically a palindrome I guess), and then check the 3rd letter matches the 3rd to last letter and so on.\n\nIf EVERY comparison returns true, then the result is true (it is a palindrome).  If the you ever get a false at any point, you immediately return false, because that proves it isn‚Äôt a palindrome.\n\nYou could of course have to handle all the little details, and make sure invalid things never happen.  So like you have to set up the loops correctly to not get any out of bounds error on the string you‚Äôre working with.  And also you could notice things like how you only have to check half of the word, because you‚Äôre checking the first half against the back half.  So setting a loop to go through the entire word would needlessly double check everything.  But you have to make sure not to mess up and only check just under half the word, so you should do half the word plus one character (just to be safe).\n\nEtc.  But yea the part you need to practice the most is the first part.  Figuring out how to actually solve the problem (forgetting about programming completely.  Like literally just figure out how to determine if a word is a palindrome by yourself, or whatever the problem is), this is generally the hardest part.  And then figuring out how to translate this solution into code (this is generally the easiest part).  And then you have to deal with making sure you‚Äôve handled all the edge cases and whatnot correctly (probably 2nd hardest part).",

But they don't actually know how understanding works.  It's the interplay among human internals and system internals.  It's why they know something but they won't help you know that.\n\nAnother huge factor that prevents your understanding is that any piece of tech is designed to its users be less worried about the internals, so the internals are hidden.

There is ALWAYS more to learn. If you spent 100 years learning one thing, you'd die before you learned \"everything about it\".

Now you have a dog class and a cat class both of which extend animal and dog implements sound to return woof and cat implements sound to return meow.\n\nNow you can have another method that takes animal which means it can take both cat and dog and access sound.\n\nAlso say cat and dog have their own specific methods say climb for cat and chase for dog that are implemented in their class and not defined in animal, then your method that takes animal would not have access to those specific methods.\n\nSo main takeaway \n\nAbstract model generic interfaces\nNon abstract specific classes.",

To keep knocking out frameworks, courses, whatever, without ever getting the confidence to dive in and start building. You probably have the requisite knowledge, training, and ability to go off-piste and stop just checking boxes to check them. \n\nI‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt learn React or whatever thoroughly if it is applicable, but I am saying you are at the point where you may have more success if you start deciding for yourself what is applicable and what isn‚Äôt.

But if you work on an incredibly complex code base with multiple contributors, it's actually a great thing for you not to just rely on your feel. In the \"real world\", imagine you're pulled off a project and someone else takes your place. This person will have no \"feel\" and will rely on test coverage to ensure they're not breaking anything.\n\nAnd finally, from my experience, relying on tests hasn't necessarily diminished my feel for the code.

It's all nice, but I feel like I've become too lazy and \"allowed\" myself to forget details because there are always tests to find everything from a typo to a logical problem.",

I need to do this > I don‚Äôt know > read docs > feel lost. That‚Äôs actually part of the process. The key is breaking projects into smaller steps. Instead of saying I need to build an app, say I‚Äôll just connect to a database or I‚Äôll write one small query. Finishing those small steps builds confidence, and over time, you‚Äôll realize you‚Äôre moving forward more than you think.\n\n33 is not old at all in tech. When you go for internships, focus less on being perfect technically, and more on how you‚Äôve dealt with problems, figured things out, and helped people in your past roles. That‚Äôs what managers like to see in interns. Internships are designed for people who are still learning. Companies don‚Äôt expect you to come in as an expert.\n\nSo I'd say apply anyway even if you feel underqualified. Build small projects that show your database skills. Keep practicing, but don‚Äôt get stuck waiting until you feel ready because you‚Äôll never feel 100% ready. The confidence comes once you‚Äôre in the role and learning by doing.

I don't know of a tool that will actively fix them for you though. Some of these scanners have code duplication detection as well, that might be a good indicator of where you can combine things or reorganize.\n\nEDIT: after some quick googling, Ndepend and DGML apparently are good tools for scanning.\n\n\\>Some way to reduce redundancy where two variables do ALMOST the same thing\n\nNot sure I know what you mean here without an example.

Having the path and following it are two completely different things.\n\nAlso, being around computers is something most people do now. Playing video games is being around a compute a lot, but just loving video games doesn't mean you'll be good at programming. To be fair, being afraid of a computer isn't great news.\n\nWhat's difficult to assess, and you won't know until you start, is how well you'll figure things out. Some people have a knack for programming even if you wouldn't expect it. Maybe they've seemed very artistic, but they also have the kind of mind to program.\n\nSo, you have three resources. The question is what do you expect from each resource?\n\nI'd probably suggest (and you'll get others, so you have to decide)\n\n* MOOC with Python (https://programming-25.mooc.fi/). Free (it's also a college course, but you won't be a student earning credits).\n* cs50p (CS50 is a set of courses offered from Harvard via edX, a consortium of universities offering college-level courses for free)\n\nYou could do those two at the same time. The goal is to get good with Python (or good enough).\n\nThen, CS50w, which gets you into web programming with Python and Flask. It's the same guys that made CS50x (which is Scratch, C, and a few other topics) and CS50p (the Python course just mentioned).\n\nCS50w covers some backend stuff.\n\nYou could use FreeCodeCamp to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript to learn some basic front-end technology. They do also have Python, but I don't think it's quite set up in a course format.\n\nOf course, someone will suggest you dive into projects, but I think it helps to know some basics before you do that. The belief is that a good project will keep your interest because you'll be interested in what you build. But that's kind of a big \"if\" (to find a project you'll be interested in that isn't impossibly difficult).\n\nAnyway, good luck. You'll have to sift through a lot of advice and decide what to do.",

Freelancing and entrepreneurial efforts are, I believe, the best route for new developers in 2025. \n\nIt's a slightly different path than the old Node and React route. Those are good tools, but they're better for teams than solo developers. \n\nI recommend using The Odin Project, especially if your interest is primarily in back end development. Try their Ruby on Rails path. Rails has been in decline for several years, but it's still a viable platform for solo development, and, more importantly, it will teach you how the back end works. Routing, models, controllers, services, ORMs,.etc. \n\nThat should serve as a solid foundation for you going forward. Python and Django, for example, will make a lot more sense if you have a Rails background. So will many opinionated frameworks. \n\nBut you're going to hear a lot of opinions based on your question. Regardless of which you choose to listen to, find your path and stick to it. Go deep before you go wide. \n\nGood luck to you.",

That's not as clear cut.\n\nJust store for each lesson the time it was completed at, and then for the \"next\" lesson you can just get the most recently completed with a single query and suggest the next one as long as it's still within the limits of how many there are.  If the queries are taking a while, you can consider denormalizing and having a table that is literally just the most recent completion (or the next lession to suggest) so that you can fetch it more quickly.\n\nYou may also want to consider event sourcing, it's probably more complex to learn/setup the first time, but you can then retroactively apply different display logic after the fact since the events are all available to reconstruct how the currrent state was reached.  HOWEVER, if it's your first app I would just go the standard CRUD way first and maybe consider trying to do event sourcing after to compare/contrast the strengths and weaknesses yourself.",

Our abstractions steadily climb higher and higher, moving further and further from the \"world just as it is\" with it's particles and whatnot.\n\nIn programming we talk machine code, binary patterns, on the lowest level, but again we ignore the details and use higher level languages, where creating a variable hides everything that really goes on.

But you guys have no formal school system so you only know how to count but no writing and no ***higher math***.  \n\nSo one day you discovered that it seems like each T-Rex has about 32 teeth.  He realized this because you have been keeping them in holes near the camp ground with each hole teeth from one T-Rex.  And since you do not write and do not add, every time you go out to trade with other tribes you simply dig up one whole put everything in your dino purse and go.  You know it is enough but not how many.  But now you know ***through repeating the same thing over and over*** that it is about 32 teeth.  \n\nSo a hole is 32 teeth and you reasoned a dino purse from a hole is 32 teeth, so you decided to count purses in the future and stop worrying about the teeth and the holes.  \n\nThat is abstraction:  teeth -> purses.",

You **can** do machine learning in any language, **but** Python is a really common interface language, **but** the actual computation behind the scenes is normally written in something like C.\n\nThe real answer is: Python is a good choice of language for beginners and it has a lot of machine learning support. After that, if your future employer wants you to use something else or your future projects require you to use something else, then be open to it. Most programming languages have similarish fundamentals anyway, so it's not time wasted - it's just adding tools to your toolkit, and once you've learnt how to use one, others will come more easily. Machine learning will also take time to learn in its own right, and learning it via a relatively easy language like Python isn't a bad choice.",

You are a beginner so its good to get experience with different tools or programing languages(obviously in the future you can specialize). Its good you have these interests and you should stick with them since that makes learning fun.\n\n1. Seeing as you like Python and want a good structured course, I would say start [CS50p on EDx](https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python). It is free, asynchronous, and you get to practice Python by solving problem sets at your own pace. The class is run by Harvard(no need to apply) with a great professor and its basically the online version of the actual class. Its beginner friendly and I highly recommend this if you want to learn more about Python. I did this course before going to college and felt it aligned well with what I learned in my Python class(make sense since CS50 is also a college level class).\n\n2. Harvard has other course under \"CS50\" like one for AI, web dev, cyber security, etc that you can do after you get more familiar with coding. These are also free and you can check them out here: [https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan](https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan)\n\n3. You also say your like web dev so I definitely suggest checking out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)(also free). This one more self learning you need to read about each topic on your own, but the content is curated(I am doing this and like the resources they provide so far). As for content the course goes over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and in the advanced course more web dev tools like node.js or ruby(there are 2 advanced courses, choose a path you like).\n\n4. You can stick with the FreeCodeCamp¬†course as well, that is a good course and you should keep doing it. As you said \"like it better as there is more involvement and actual coding\" this is great that you get to do more hands on stuff.\n\n5. W3 schools is alright, you are definitely right to think the problem is you are just reading but are not applying any of the things you learn. As many people have said you learn by doing aka projects even if they are small or simple. The important part is you thought about what to type out and learned something during the process.",

To explain, CS50p will cover these topics week by week for 10 weeks aka 10 online lectures:\n\n1. functions,\n2. variables,\n3. conditionals,\n4. loops,\n5. exceptions cases,\n6. using libraries,\n7. unit tests file I/O,\n8. regular expression,\n9. Object-Oriented Programming & classes,\n10. recursion.\n\nThis is more about applying little programming technique week by week. Each week has a few problems to solve using and expanding on the skills you learned up to that point. These of course are not full projects, but still very good practice to learn skills in a controlled and friendly environment. They test problem solving skills as well which never hurts.\n\n# The Odin Project:\n\nThis has excellent projects and to clarify The Odin Project is for front end and back end. It has an introduction course teaching HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Then you can choose to learn ruby or node.js or both and these advanced course are at least 5-8x longer than the introduction course so plenty to learn.\n\nThe structure is:\n\n* You basically read a few curated lessons and external resources\n* Make a project which is a website such as:\n   * Basic HTML page\n   * Landing page with styling\n   * Making web page games or interactive pages after learning Java Script\n   * Even more advanced pages after learning more tools\n* This cycle of reading and making projects repeats itself. They have a discord to help you if you get stuck, but the course is pretty detailed/clear. Essentially there are many chances to make projects and if you feel comfortable you can make your own outside of the course.\n\nThis is heavily project based as you are given a general goal when you reach a project assignment. Other than that you just make your own website following the general theme or requirements. This is also self graded but with web dev its pretty easy to see how well you did by viewing your website based on content, design, and functionality. You also get to learn about version control through Git and Git Hub. This is great since now you projects will be on a repository that you can make public or private as you wish. Furthermore you can actually see your website live and deploy it. For the beginner course they just make these websites hosted on Git Hub, but in the advanced course they show others ways of hosting and using more advanced tools.\n\nIf you have more questions feel free to ask!",

Spotify doesn't make it easy at all to download the audio, it's against their terms of service. And even if you had the audio, automatically determining the chord progression isn't simple or straightforward at all. There may be some advanced AI audio algorithms that try to do it, but I'd expect them to have errors.\n\nHonestly the most likely approach would be to fetch the playlist from Spotify, then search for online libraries of lyrics and chords, then try to analyze the chord progression from there. That would be complex but at least plausibly doable. I'm not aware of a centralized database with chord progressions for most songs, but there are plenty of places online that have them in nonstandard formats (often text). Then you'd have to parse various ways to write chords, transpose into the same key to normalize, and count how many are the \"same\".\n\nEven determining which is the \"same\" isn't easy. Do you count I, V, vi, IV the same as vi, IV, I, V? What about I, V7, vi, IV? There are lots of chord progressions that are very similar but not identical.",

Your variables give you the location of the \\*start\\* of the data structure, but you have to be aware of how big they are, or where the \\*end\\* of the data structures are.\n\nThis is particularly important when dealing with arrays.  The line:  \n\n\n    char buffer[MAXSIZE];\n\nis telling the compiler, \"reserve a chunk of memory as big as sizeof(char) \\* MAXSIZE in the stack frame of this function\".  There is NO PROTECTION to make sure you stay inside your MAXSIZE-sized buffer; if you ask the compiler to do this:\n\n    buffer[MAXSIZE + 5] = 'x';\n\nit will happily do that.  which will, of course, go stomping on some other variable in your function's stack, or off into unallocated memory, or who knows what.  You are responsible for always being aware of where the end of your fixed size buffers are, and always checking your offsets (or pointers, if you go that way) to make sure you are still in bounds.  This is, of course, a pain, and much of the discipline of working with C is about finding easy to manage and easy to maintain ways of dealing with such data structures.\n\nI compiled your program and fed it a 5000-byte input, and it segfaulted immediately.  Do you see why?",

Even without AI, the job was getting easier due to better tooling and specialization of SaaSes. Ie a newer architecture takes significantly less manpower to maintain even at high scale compared to old architectures. \n\nI was a VP at a startup founded around 2013. Their first product took a team of 60 engineers to maintain. Our second product, built on a more modern stack, took 6 engineers and made as much revenue and processed more scale. This led to a limited refactor of the first product which removed the hardest to maintain parts, freeing up engineers to work on new things. \n\nI'm talking simple stuff - like using SQS, lambda functions, etc. \n\nAnyways I think companies are dialling in a new cost -> revenue ratio wrt to engineering resourcing. \n\nTwitter is one extreme (but not recommended) example of this, ie everything thought it would crash and burn and yeah, there were a few pains, but overall the service stayed up with a third of the engineers. \n\nGoogle/Meta have also done a ton of reorgs, and while some of those are layoffs, a lot of them is reshuffling people to new team and new bets because less people needed to work on each products. \n\nAnyways it's all first hand thoughts and super anecdotal. I just don't see why people would go back to hiring as much as they did with the salaries as they were. It was kind of silly and frankly most people I know in FAANG were coasting pretty hard.",

They may have \"skills\" that make them better suited for managerial or leadership roles. My manager says he has development experience, but he can't parse simple emails coming from Vendors informing us that they are changing their API tokens etc, and needs a dev to explain what is needed.\n\nPeople who are good at the technical stuff generally do not want the additional responsibilities, stress and the need to deal with other people that comes with being a manager. As an IC, my only interaction is with my team and with my manager, so around 6-7 people in total, and maybe 3 on an average day. My manager on the other hand, on average meets with 10 different people a day and maybe 25-30 people in total over a month. I never see myself as having the bandwidth to be able to tolerate that.\n\nIn short, tech leadership requires a Goldilocks person who is both reasonably adept at the technical side of what they are managing, and has the managerial and leadership skills that are needed for the role. These people are likely rare and are already at highly compensated roles, and they enjoy what they are doing. That means the rest of the market has to make do with the average and below average candidates, many of whom are the aforementioned people who convert from technical roles to leadership.",

You need to be able to do the work, and you need to be able to get along with people.\n\nLook at what you wrote:\n\n>I think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.\n\nThis is a classic engineer/programmer mindset. You're assuming you're smarter than everyone else, and that's the reason you're having a hard time at work. I worked with someone whose first reaction to everything was seethe and talk behind people's backs. He complained once our manager didn't understand something and was just making things harder. I told him, \"why don't you just talk to him?\" Our manager had been technical in the past and was generally pretty easy-going. He went to talk to him, and they switched how they were going to do things. Some people get busy or can't spend the focused time to think through every detail. That's why they're assigning the work to you. While there are extremes, as in the case of the MBAs, there are a lot of senior technical people who are less hands-on-keyboard than they used to be who do understand all the work you're doing, but their time is better spent elsewhere.\n\nYou will run into people who argue the technical work is the easy part. In a lot of cases, you're working on something that is a known thing/solution/pattern. Think about all the people looking for jobs right now? A good portion of them are nearly interchangeable skill-wise. So other things have to help differentiate them, along with a little luck.\n\nYou should work on building relationships with people. This can be done in parallel with hard, technical work.\n\nSo many devs like to trivialize the work of others. Try working in an environment with great management compared to bad management, you'll see a world of difference. Try leading a team and not being allowed to be heads-down working on code day after day. You'll be doing very different types of work, and a lot of people struggle with the transition.\n\nThe dev work you're describing for building a website or an API is easy. Others have done it before, you can follow examples/instructions, etc. Yes, there start to be complications if there are some specific requirements, etc, but you're trying to either overstate how difficult it is, or you're not experienced with it.",

Document how you solved them, and have a good answer for this kind of question.

If so, then no wonder he's struggling badly in mid level interviews in this current job market. Thus this is an aspect he needs to urgently address, but we can't even get to the point of discussing how to do this, if he won't even discuss it as a possibility.\n\nEdit 2, to reply to u/Azureflames20:\n\n> I feel like if you‚Äôre someone who takes this much offense to a valid possible criticism, there‚Äôs some bigger ego issues to work on and squish.\n\nYeah I'd bet money on the fact he doesn't just have technical skills he needs to work on, but is lacking in soft skills areas as well, that are likely coming through during the interviews.\n\nEdit 3, a reply to u/mariogario123:\n\n> So why is someone who stuck around for 6 years going to be knowing more than someone who jumped every, let‚Äôs say, 1.5 years. \n\nAm certainly not saying 6yrs is the optimal time to stay at a company! (from the employee perspective... )\n\nBut if you're jumping every year or two, then do you truly get to see the full entire SDLC? And thus truly feel the ramifications of the decisions that are made way back at the start. Or are you jumping too early every time to learn the lessons? \n\nDon't think we can say there is one magic \"optimal number\", depends so much on: the person, the company, market conditions, and more.\n\nEdit 4, a reply to u/evanescent-despair:\n\n> So what should someone who‚Äôs jobless even do if they have a 6x 1YOE situation?\n\nWell, first of all they need to recognize it, as then it is easier to come up with a plan to fix it. \n\nThey might even find this realization freeing. As if you're 6YOE deep into a career, you might feel yourself \"stuck\" in it with \"golden handcuffs\" (or at least silver plated handcuffs). And you can't just give this up and take a big drop / step back into a new career instead. \n\nHowever, if you're just at 1YOE into it reality, then it's much easier to decide upon a career pivot?\n\nWhile if they *do* decide to stick with it, they need to figure out their strengths and weaknesses, so they can play to their strengths and patch up their weaknesses to at least competent mid level. \n\nBecause they need to quickly be able to \"fake\" being mid/senior level and even better in the long run *actually become* mid/senior level ability. \n\nAs likely they're coming across in interviews and their CV as someone who is *not* mid/senior and interviewers are smelling this from a mile away. And nobody wants a 6YOE Junior!",

Probably there is something like \"verify the results of regression testing.\" Then in your stand up you say you ran the regression tests and logged the results and verified the fix was successful. In SCRUM meetings you're just supposed to say you did so-and-so or a single task and today you will be doing another task - so you state what that task will be. Probably if I was the manager I might wonder what are you going to be doing today? You kind of need someone in the team you are on to be a mentor to you so reach out to some of the other team members and try to become friends with them. Then explain to them your feelings and ask for help identifying what you should be doing each day.

They take the easy way out. I had an interview just like this a month ago, it was interesting.\n\nI'm too late to the party, but here are my few comments. I am tipsy.\n\nI have been an occasional hiring manager/tech interviewer for last 15 years in companies of various sizes. From nough startups to couple of billions in current account. Disclaimer - I mostly mostly work in highly regulated backend area (gambling/fintech) as a senior/staff/principal.\n\n* In organisation of any size hiring manager has way less input into how we evaluate candidates than you would think. From the company perspective your CV requires at least a screening meeting (internal), chat with HR (yes, candidate looks promising!) and time slots from at least 2 seniors for at least 2 different meetings + EM meeting (position fit) + executive meeting (culture/ambitions fit).\n\n* * We cannot spend time on every single candidate. You really are asked to stand out to proceed, cost of hiring you approaches $100k in time commitment from everyone involved + another $100k for your onboarding. I must apologise, but that is what our in-house recruiters are responsible for.\n\n* Good companies do domain specific take home assignment with known gotchas (e.g. rounding issues, how to handle various dimensions depending on domain, performance considerations, ability to join two tables to start with, not even talking about various consistency scenarios). Yes, it sounds like unpaid work, but it is a fantastic filter between those that have a clue and those that copy paste from stack overflow. We are about to invest 12 months in you getting up to speed, we ask for 4-8 hours of you showing off your skills.\n\n* * These assignments usually are crafted with great care by rather highly paid engineers in the org. There can only be so many of them prepared, check glassdoor, it usually will spell out what you need to succeed.\n\n* LC is a good screener for 99% of candidates that couldn't code their way out of looking up data from users table. Anyone who displays awareness of constraints, different naming nomenclatures, jeez (here comes the dragons) - time zones ... or even utf8mb4 v utf8mb3... automatically a plus.\n\n* Always remember that we WANT TO HIRE YOU! Seriously! We wouldn't be hiring otherwise! What seems to be a field of obstacles is not meant to discourage you, but to make sure you get a face time with your peers whose opinion will really count. Please accept that if my week is 40 hours and every day i have 2 hours blocked for hiring (with 15 minutes before each meeting to research candidate background, 15 minutes afterwards to summarize my notes and provide feedback all while actually moving business forward...) Executive or EM discussion fail can very easily be overriden if 2 actual team members says \"5 stars, he/she/they will fit GREAT\".\n\n* Candidates should and will be treated equally. Ignoring cases where candidate had a nervous breakdown during interview (has happened, more than once. it's not a showstopper, it's a stop-the-interview and reschedule to start from tabula rasa. One of the few things big tech gets right is to dismiss outlier incidents), we do need to show that we care about results, not about gender, race, etc. And we are pretty objective about it. Except positive bias.\n\n---\n\nAs for your specific comment that most managers are bad. I used to think the same until I became an engineering manager. There's so fucking much politics and shoulder playing between teams and horse trading to just move ahead with the project that is our job to shield you from.\n\nYes, you think your ticket with specification and acceptance criteria is done and easy and you can just proceed. 50% of the time that feature is actually under a chopping axe because someone else in the company wants to take eventual credit for it / is unable to formulate where their API points are expected to be / knows that you are doing null work that will be discarded because corporate strategy has separate team working on replacement. Sucks, but not due to you and not due to your EM.",

I conducted over a dozen last month.\n\nFor the record, our interviews include some discussion with the candidate on their experience, a leetcode type question, and some system design. The leetcode question is not meant to be difficult, and we use something that is classified as easy or homegrown stuff that is similarly quite easy. One question we often use, for example, has a very trivial n^2 solution (literally try every pair of values and make sure the index of j is after i).\n\nWhen I am conducting interviews everything matters. It's not just a black and white do you solve the question and I check off the box. Here's a list of some things that I am looking at to make a decision that aren't just \n\n* How quickly do you start solving and how quickly do you solve it? Does it look like you've seen the question before? Does it look like someone else or AI is solving the question for you?\n* How well can you articulate what your solution is and how it works? Do you articulate what your approach to the question is before you write code or after?\n* If you run into problems, what do you do for debugging? Are you reading the error logs? Are you printing things to see?\n* If you are struggling with the question, do you ask questions? What kind of questions do you ask? How long does it take for you to ask a question when you're stuck?\n* Our question has one common pitfall (which is honestly quite obvious). Do you fall for this? If you do, when I explain what is happening, can you pick up on where you fell into that pitfall? Do I have to explain it very explicitly or can you pick it up?\n* Can you even code? Do you run into basic syntax problems? Do you know what help to ask me for on the syntax issues? Does it look like you barely even know how to code?\n* Are you cognizant of the time we have and what our expectations are?\n* I specifically ask the candidate two follow up questions every time the answer is solved: what is the runtime complexity and is your solution optimal. This helps me figure out what kind of more formal education the person has (because all of us remember studying big O notation, right?). This also helps me figure out if they're capable of scrutinizing their own code. It also helps me see how they tackle a problem that may not have an obvious answer (or even one at all).\n\nDon't conduct an interview with a question that doesn't have a purpose. In fact, don't do things that don't have at least half a dozen purposes. Everything I do has a purpose and helps me evaluate it. I have absolutely no problem letting you sit in silence for 10 minutes as you mumble to yourself about your solution, it will help me see how you think. Heck, if you want to sit there in silence and write no code and ask zero questions it will show me how collaborative you want to be (and I explicitly mention they're welcome to ask me questions, even to ask for help). I very intentionally do not use difficult questions because I very intentionally want to measure other things. I could care less if you remember how to invert a binary tree or the difference between Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms or any of that mumbo jumbo that, as you point out, will never be useful on the job. I do care if you can reason your way through something new and present a working solution, even if it means asking someone for help.",

When is AI gonna make money?\". Meta is paying several millions of dollars for individual AI researchers. Warren Buffet liquidated over a billion in shares and is holding cash. *Nvidia alone accounts for 7.3% of the entire S&P 500*, which is insane.\n\n\nThere are a dozen signs from employment to inflation that were already in a recession. The current administration's desperation to lower interest rates shows they know somethin bad is about to happen, and they're firing anyone who threatens to break the dam by being honest about the numbers (e.g. the Labor Bureau head).\n\n\nSo it's gonna get worse.

I think we're really going to struggle to spend our way out of this one, because foreign interests aren't buying our debt.\n\n\nSo my advice is pay down debt. Save aggressively if you can.

CS is kind of in a perfect storm environment. I think we are in the early stages of a recession, combined with us having high interest rates and over hiring in pandemic has made the job market really tough for entry level talent. I don't think tis going to get better in 1 to 2 years.  \n\n\nHowever, what I do think is that tech and CS is not going way. My personal educated guess is that there will be new types of roles emerging that will be more like product person + roles. Essentially where you would be expected to do project managing plus software development with AI tools. \n\nI don't think software engineering that requires extensive OOP experience  are going anywhere.  I think AI is going to make certain areas of tech explode that people aren't thinking about enough today. The biggest one is I think cyber security, fraud detection etc.  The thing is the tools that tech has pushed the last ten years (AI, Crypto,  Payment servies like cash apps) are eco systems that have encouraged sophisticated criminal activity and thats only going to grow. That also means the opposite is true jobs meaning to minimize fraud risks, protect data are probably going to grow.\n\nPeople talk about AI automating jobs, but most of the people doing the talking have never even sat in a labor economics or macroeconomics course. AI is the type of technical innovtion that compliments the skills of some workers and replaces the skills of others. USually what these type of technologies replace are repetitive tasks. So the more your job is doing the same repetive task (i.e. generating the same reports/analyitcs over and over again) the more likely that job is replaced by AI. This is why I think the future is being more in the product type roles (which are the ones getting laid off the most). However, these jobs will evolve into something like product + software, instead of just product,\n\nI also think the industries in general are going to reward people who think outside fo the box and push creative boundaries. AI is very good at creating simple designs. I think any company that is relying on AI to be the drive for their innovation will probably fall behind in the long term.",

People who are thinking that we will see a return to the mid-2010s tech scene are kidding themselves. AI, outsourcing, and a glut of talent mean that people who went to decent schools for a CS degree, which would have been a sure bet ten years ago, will now flounder in the job market.\n\nThe days of being an average, generalist CRUD app or devops developer and pulling good money are gone. Only established people and the 10x devs will survive, and they will earn bigger paychecks than ever. \n\nTech as a field will continue to grow, and there will be ways to profit immensely from it. However, simply being a decent developer in a certain tech stack is no longer sufficient to stand out. Sure, some people will get lucky and land good roles, but that's what it is: luck (but they will still delude themselves when they come on this sub and call it hard work).\n\nI like to compare it to the DBAs of the first dotcom bubble. Tons of companies had large in-house IT teams and DBAs who made good money. The rise of cloud services and MSPs made them less relevant. Obviously there are still jobs in that industry, but it is more competitive and less lucrative today. Only the best survived and the mediocre people moved on with their lives and found other fields.",

I was nearly down-leveled over a Karot interview which happened in the first week of studying LC in a new language, Java. With a slow interview process, I was able to get up to speed on all the other parts, and by the time I got to a a hiring manager I felt pretty good. Now I'm a team lead at that job, lol.\n\nThe biggest difference, is that to be successful today, versus in 2020, is that companies are being a bit more picky. Whether that's judging pedigree/experience with more scrutiny, or making the interview process longer and involving more steps with higher bars.\n\nEither way, making a step up is very much possible, but you'll likely have to learn the interview process and invest time into the various skills: pitching yourself, LC (or whatever knowledge base is required for ML), systems design (esp. LLM serving, ML systems), and finally behavioral.\n\nPersonally, I'll jump in about 18 months if I don't make Staff and can't switch orgs, and I'm planning about a 6 month period of interview prep, some LC, lots of sys design, and really focus on behavioral. I'm definitely a corporate-type, neoliberal and process-based thinker, and if you can lean into that it really helps.",

We haven't used it for years. But in documentation and informal conversation \"what's your LDAP?\" became synonymous with \"what is your username in our network?\" This persisted even after LDAP was deprecated. It's now been picked up on by people who have joined the company long after that deprecation. So you have non-technical people who have no clue what LDAP even is asking \"what's your LDAP\" when we haven't even used LDAP for like a decade and they joined a year ago.",

Your question, taken at face value, makes no sense. Why would an employer willingly choose a candidate with less demonstrated experience? The answer to this question is \"get more experienced\".\n\nI say this as someone who entered the industry in my 40s, with no CS background, no college, no bootcamps, no professional contacts in the field. \"How do I get hiring managers to consider me?\" was a question I asked myself, fruitlessly, for years. But as a hiring manager now, I get it. Why would I have considered me? And even if I have a disposition to consider more oddball candidates, given my background, there's still an ATS and a literal army of recruiter between me and our candidate pipeline, so I really never even get to see candidates who are oddball. Those are filtered out long before the candidate is talking to me.\n\nI'm interested to hear what other people here will say. I'm sure there are other ways to skin this cat. But the solution I settled on was to change my approach and expectations. I stopped applying for SWE and started applying to roles that were adjacent to, or had some plausible path to, where I wanted to be. I had zero impressive experience you could put on a resume, so I had to start far away, in (non-technical) customer support in my dream company. If you have some impressive experience but not impressive enough for a SWE role, you might consider something like Solutions Architect if you're more into operations, or some kind of Data Analyst role if you spike on the SQL/mathematical/statistical side.\n\nFind companies you think would be good to work for, and start looking through their open roles. Don't limit yourself to only the specific role you think you want next (and for which 100% of employers are ghosting you on).\n\n\\*Sure maybe once in a blue moon this happens for mostly unique or at least impractical reasons (\"candidate has 200k followers on Twitter and a strong social media brand as a SWE influencer\", \"candidate is a maintainer on some piece of OSS that is important to us\", etc), but by and large it's not a thing.\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Also my answer is calibrated specifically for your situation: breaking into the industry.

Normally, hiring folks out of university is seen as an OK investment. The hiring pipeline assumes that for every university hire, maybe 80% of them leave (voluntarily or otherwise) before 5 years. Those 80% give you workhorses that aren't exactly cash cows, but keep the business running. The folks who stay on long term tend to be high performers who carry onward business knowledge.\n\nIt's no longer acceptable to just have an \"OK\" investment from the budgeting process. I've been involved in presenting proposed bodies of work all the way up to the CFO of a F500. Effectively, the view from executive management is that every project needs to be a home run out of the park in order to get approval in the current environment. That means you need to staff it with experienced people who already know the business domain, and can execute quickly without any hand holding - because the promised timelines  to executives are aggressive. I've directly been told by middle management to \"accelerate\" certain projects because other initiatives got approved, and that meant ripping our existing juniors off and re-staffing them on other work.\n\nThat means as an engineering manager, that you no longer want to hire juniors. There is really nothing you can do - because the roles don't exist in certain companies now. The only thing that will fix that are lowered interest rates, or you try to apply for companies which aren't cash strapped. That inherently means AI or crypto companies at the moment, which in themselves will have stability issues.",

To me it's dumbassery and not some vague idea of a market.\n\n\nThe thing with playing leadership Russian roulette is that it creates chaos, and company culture ends up in flux, and you simply don't know what company you're really joining. The company may not resemble the one you heard about in interviews simply because they cleaned out the leadership either during your application process or early in your job there. It's frustrating and it can practically nullify your \"reverse interview\" efforts.\n\n\nI would say this is a red flag for the company and you should think long and hard about working there.

We had one junior (there were six of us) that had this \"don't worry it's just java web development, it's easy.\" Some of us were struggling hard and hearing this actually made one of the devs switch to a QA position.

That said, there's things you can do that will help.\n\nBreak your team's responsibilities down into pillars or silos of knowledge (your manager can help with what your team specifically works on). Usually, it's these:\n\n* Infrastructure/Networking\n* Application Orchestration\n* Observability\n* Internal Tools\n\nTo start, pick one to go deep into, and develop a passable understanding of the rest. You will accumulate a deeper understanding of everything over time, and gain an instinct for what you should understand (principles) and what you can discard (bitrotting technical details). Work with your manager to get projects in the specific pillar you want to gain expertise in if possible. If that's not possible, pick something else for now and come back to it.\n\nWhen you're working on stuff, take notes on things that you learn that could be helpful in the future. Do personal retros on particular projects/tasks that you struggled with and try to internalize the knowledge that you gained. This takes a lot of effort, and some of it may come after hours. That's why DevOps/SRE tends to get paid more though, so...swings and roundabouts.\n\nTotal honesty here: people will tell you that you don't need to be a hardcore techie to be successful, but if we define \"hardcore techie\" as \"someone who is really into understanding why systems behave the way that they do and is not content with just a surface-level understanding\", then not being one is absolutely career limiting in DevOps/SRE. Because of how fast the tech moves in the infrastructure space (while simultaneously breaking in ways that require an understanding of the underlying primitives - like Linux Networking), hunger and curiosity is a requirement. If I had to add another thing, it would be a deep appreciation for rigorous and disciplined engineering.\n\nAll that is to say - the amount of stuff to learn should bring you joy, not stress. If all it does is stress you out, it might be best to find a regular SWE job.",

That's why asking directly about it doesn't work.\n\nA company that demands everyone work for *only* 60 hours a week instead of 80 hours week could truthfully claim that they have a good work life balance. And they do, relative to that other company.\n\nThat, and if you're asking questions that have an objectively right answer, of course they can just lie. They know the answer you're looking for. \"Do you have a good WLB?\" --> \"Yep!\". Easy peezy.\n\nInstead, you have to ask questions about the things that in your opinion make up a good work life balance. Questions that don't have objectively correct answers.\n\nFor example, a favorite one of mine is to ask them to tell me about a time when the team was missing a deadline, and what was done in reaction. There is no \"right\" answer to that question. It's also asking about a *specific anecdote*, so people are much less likely to lie about that, and if they try it's much harder to come up with a good story-lie on the spot.\n\nIf an interviewer said something like \"The team really came together and rallied to hit the deadline despite all odds\" for example would be a good answer to some people. To me? Red flag. That means when the team gets bad deadlines, they do crunch time to make up for it. The answer *I'm* looking for is something about dialing back scope, extending the deadline, or allocating more resources. Those are green flags. That indicates management knows how to do project management 101, and developers aren't asked to work long hours to make up for unrealistic deadlines.\n\nAnother example, I like to ask about how frequent after-hours production support calls are. This gives me insight into product stability, and in turn what the on call rotation will look like.\n\nAgain, there isn't really an objectively correct answer to this question. Everyone might be looking for different answers. I remember one time I asked this question to the hiring manager, and he got this big grin on his face and said they only get called after hours 1-2 times a month. He genuinely thought that was a good thing. Maybe it is compared to a place like AWS, but what *I* was looking for was a stable product that only gets after hour calls 1-2 times ***a year***. Not a month. I politely rejected that company.\n\nThink about what makes up a good WLB *to you*. Then develop questions asking about those things.",

Without the security of the paid version there is always a chance of what you use an AI program for gets leaked to your competitors or worse- your clients competitors.  They are learning programs, so with each task they are given they try to learn so  it can be used for future tasks.  You can see where this is a security risk if the program is allowed to learn from your work and your competition uses the same program for a similar task.  For that alone your company should be paying for any AI tools they expect you to use.",

But I don't know how many years we are removed from that and how many layers of depth and innovation on top of that are needed to meet the bar.\n\n\nI have a couple of full stack applications that, in my opinion, are relatively complex. So far my interviews have been few and far between, so I don't know how much they're helping. One interviewer seemed interested in them but I failed hard as it was my first serious interview and I wasn't prepared to explain how I made them well.

News at eleven!\n\n>No amount of thinking \"My ideas are worth a million dollars\" is going to change peoples minds if in reality they are not million dollar ideas, so it is just stupid and delusional to think like that.\n\nYou forgot \"pointless\", because the vast, vast majority f developers is not getting hired for their million dollar ideas. and I honestly have no idea what could possibly make you think otherwise. If that was even remotely true, the majority of developers would not be employed, or seeking employment - we would all be independently wealthy with out own products.",

If sending my resume out to places gets nowhere then the rational conclusion to draw is that the resume is not impressive to employers in any way. If hiring people aren't impressed by my projects than the only logical assumption to make is that the people being hired have significantly better projects in every way (more users, more profits, more relevance to each company).

The reason being that your current employer might resent you for forcing their hand and look for a way to get rid of you later. I wouldn't necessarily agree with that, and have taken the counter-offer in the past without negative repercussions. I did leave that employer 6 months after taking the counter-offer when I got an even better offer, so it didn't really work out for them, but it was good for me.\n* Your compensation is on the low end for the senior SWE in a super expensive city, especially given the RTO requirement. The fact that you secured another offer, and your current employer wants to keep you, means you could likely do better.\n* Outside of compensation, there might be other benefits to working at the current company. E.g. You might get good leadership experience in the new lead role. Think about whether it might be possible to move within your current company to work under a different manager.\n* If you aren't able to switch teams while staying at your current employer, I'd probably recommend taking the other offer, based solely on the fact that you described the current team as \"quite toxic\". Hopefully the new role will be pretty chill, and you'll have time to upskill on your own, then seek out an even better offer.",

However, if you‚Äôre working alongside other Seniors and they‚Äôre not doing the level of team management you‚Äôre doing, then it might be beyond what a Senior does at your org. Similarly, are there other Leads around that you can compare with? If your org doesn‚Äôt have Leads, that‚Äôs a very different situation.\n\nThere are a lot of different implementations of this. At some places, a Lead is a line manager. Other places, you have a Tech Lead, who is essentially a particular archetype of Staff, but people stuff is handled by someone else. At some places, there‚Äôs what‚Äôs called a ‚ÄúTech Lead Manager‚Äù, which is sort of in between the two ‚Äì¬†usually they have project-level accountability and input into performance discussions, but maybe they don‚Äôt do salary review, etc.\n\nOne useful way to frame this is, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm enjoying the work I‚Äôm doing to lead (or ‚Äòhelp lead‚Äô) the team, and I‚Äôd like to talk about my growth path. How close would you say I am to being a Lead Software Engineer, and what are the areas I need to put in work to get there? Can we plan out that journey so that I‚Äôm doing the highest impact things?‚Äù\n\nBasically, it gets you a lot more information while looking really good and not coming off as a squeaky wheel. A lot of the other ways to approach this can come off as whiny / demanding, which can be totally fine, but is sometimes not fine‚Ä¶ and is often not fine for reasons that you don‚Äôt have visibility on. Framing it as about your growth gets your leadership thinking about ways to grow you lest they lose you, but in a non-confrontational way. Also, if there‚Äôs something fundamental that you‚Äôre missing, you‚Äôre better off knowing before you spend a year wondering why you‚Äôre not being promoted.\n\nDepending on your relationship with your boss / skip-level boss, that might be a good conversation to have with both of them.",

The warehouses are made for humans, so there's a lot of \"wasted\" space and energy put into lighting, climate control, space for humans to walk around, safety, human-readable labels, etc. If a robot has to dodge humans, keep them safe, and read plain-text labels, it's going to be less efficient and a lot harder to program than a dense structure that \\_only\\_ accomodates bots and works by perfectly orchestrating them from some central computer. \n\nCoding languages and our entire tech stack are built for humans in the same way. They try to bridge the gap between natural language and machine language so humans can guide the machines. That's why most devs use higher level languages even though assembly is way more efficient (if you know how to work with it). This is a huge bottleneck for LLMs, because they have to use their computer-language brain to translate your natural langauge into a programminmg language only for it to end up back as a computer language, and that's only for coding itself. IMO, \"beyond human\" programming would cut out the middleman (programming langauges) entirely and work purely on CPU instructions. Data would be densely packed and would not be human-readable, \"code\" would be pure binary, there wouldn't really be a distinction between API, Database, Frontend, etc. \n\nBasically it would look a lot like how ML \"brains\" look to us now: we can't really look at the data they're made of and trace exactly how input A leads to output B, because it's all just inscrutable math to us. We just have to give it in the input and tell it if it got the output we expect. A beyond human program would work the same way, a black box that we just test until it does what we want it to do.",

That all goes towards how affordable and scalable a codebase may be. And \"stability\" strictly from a codebase perspective (ignoring infra) is again mostly a human concept. How bug free is it, how easy is it to catch *human mistakes* that create bugs before they get released. And it ties back to extensibility, how easily can features be added without accidentally introducing regressions that slip into prod.\n\nUnit, integration, and regression testing are *all* concepts built to catch *human mistakes*. It's so when I make a change, I can click a button and see if my change broke anything, and we can enforce passing tests before PR's get merged to prevent mistakes. Remove the human element, and none of those concepts serve a purpose anymore.\n\n\"better than human\" programming, is programming without bugs, or need for simplicity/readability, or need for extensibility, or need for maintainability.\n\nOne example of what that might look like would be a codebase with 0 testing, and that's extremely abstract and difficult to read, to the point it might even be non-sensical to a human reader. I'd know it was either written by a \"better than human\" AI that has no need for the fundamentals of human programming, or by a bad SWE that isn't aware of the fundamentals of human programming.\n\nBetter than human programming is when AI has reached a point where 99% of the issues/concepts that this industry have literally evolved around simply no longer exist. \"Difficult to extend\" is strictly a human problem. If AI coded itself into a corner, it'd just rewrite everything from scratch. It doesn't *need* an elegant solution that doesn't need to be re-written with every little change.\n\nYour chess analogy isn't really that great here. All the elements of chess are inherent to the existence of chess. An AI is just learning to play the game. But a significant amount of the elements that make up *human* programming are not inherent to *programming*.",

Technical writing, product management, business analysis, project management, and sales engineering all leverage your tech background while moving away from pure development work.\n\nData analysis roles in non-tech industries like healthcare, finance, or logistics often need people who understand both technology and domain-specific problems. Your programming background makes you valuable for automating processes or building internal tools.\n\nTeaching or training - bootcamps, corporate training programs, or educational content creation - let you use your technical knowledge to help others learn. Many former developers transition into developer relations, technical recruiting, or consulting roles.\n\nThe current tech job market difficulties don't necessarily mean the entire industry is collapsing. Many experienced developers are finding opportunities, just with longer search times and more competition than previous years.\n\nBefore pivoting completely, consider whether you're dealing with temporary market conditions or genuine disinterest in technical work. The job search frustration might be influencing your desire to leave the field entirely.\n\nNon-tech pivots often require starting over salary-wise and building new professional networks. The grass isn't necessarily greener in other industries, many of which have their own challenges with job security and advancement.\n\nIf you do pivot, choose something that genuinely interests you rather than just escaping current difficulties. Career changes work better when driven by positive attraction to new opportunities rather than just running away from current problems.",

We tried hiring for data science/engineering positions a year or two ago, and we decided to put that on ice because we got too many applications and the quality was too low. You'll have a very hard time getting noticed unless you really stand out in some way.\n\nThe other problem is that a lot of basic data science/engineering type tasks are something a good developer can knock out in their sleep, and it also doesn't take much before the task needs some custom software written and you basically need to be a developer anyway. We deal with massive amounts of data in all kinds of weird formats with weird encodings and inconsistencies, so we need people that can engineer solid solutions and not get stumped when their program blows up because the file has a BOM.",

That can include meetings, mandatory training, reading status update emails from others on your team, reading companywide emails, installing security updates, and so on.\n\nThat leaves you with 32 hours of productive work (e.g. coding).\n\nIf you switch to half-time, that overhead doesn't noticeably decrease. So now you end up with only 12 hours of productive work, which is a lot less than half.\n\nIn my experience, the most junior employees are the ones who have the least overhead - so they'd probably be the least affected - but then again, they're also the least productive so I wouldn't want them to be even less productive.\n\nThe most senior employees tend to have the most overhead - they're in more meetings, they email with many more groups within the company.\n\nHonestly, there are many weeks where if I only worked 20 hours, I wouldn't have time to finish a single productive task.",

Try to figure out how to make changes, test, and receive feedback on those changes without bricking the system. For example, make custom endpoints/functions/whatever in the relevant backend that only you know of and use those to test logic before pasting it into the actual production code. It may even be good to inform your manager and seniors what error handling/logging currently looks like, and see if you can improve it. If making whatever fix is made impossibly difficult before this, let your manager/seniors know you need to be able to properly debug or you can‚Äôt make the fix. \n\n\nThis may seem sucky, but it was honestly an excellent learning experience for me. Although frankly, your situation seems worse than mine haha. \n\nYou have to be bluntly honest about how screwed you are for whatever deadline they‚Äôre trying to push for that fix. You‚Äôre an intern lol. Making fixes in an unknown, undocumented nightmare with shit logging and shit error handling would take anybody a lot of time. What‚Äôs the worst that happens, they get rid of you? You were planning on quitting anyway.",

Worked a few months in a freelance kind of gig, but that stopped early this year.\n\nI suggest focusing on getting a local job if you don't have one, primarily. Part-time ideally. So that you can cover your own bills and have time to invest in yourself. I am talking basic stuff like food, phone bill, some socialising, but not rent. If you have just graduated then trust me, the difference between NO income and ANY income is massive. You don't want to rely on your parents too much, at least I did not. Then you can start thinking about how to invest in yourself with that income (so certs if you think that is wise) to get into a sort of specialised labour with higher income potential. This is the route that I am going, after being a try hard for quite a while.\n\nI am essentially following this video: https://youtu.be/r\\_58zPgArb4?si=nmHVEWPGYKFpSVjm. It is under 10 minutes. It made sense to me. If it makes sense to you, then figure out where you are and focus on the next level.\n\nBut don't just blindly follow this comment, as I am not where you want to be. Consult with a friend or relation who is where you want to be and confirm if it makes sense. It makes sense for MY particular circumstance, but maybe YOURS is different.\n\nHave fun!",

Keep your skills sharp through consistent practice and stay updated on relevant technologies in your field, but don't chase every new trend. Having a solid emergency fund reduces desperation and gives you negotiating power during job searches.\n\nFor quick job placement after layoffs, preparation matters more than speed. Maintain an updated resume, active LinkedIn presence, and professional network even while employed. Document your achievements with specific metrics and keep a portfolio of recent work ready. Many developers wait until they're unemployed to start networking, which puts them at a disadvantage.\n\nThe harsh reality is that \"quickly\" landing new jobs isn't realistic in the current market for most people. Even experienced developers are facing longer search periods than in previous years. Setting expectations of 3-6 months for job searches prevents the anxiety that comes from unrealistic timelines.\n\nFocus on financial preparation over trying to become \"layoff-proof\" since job security has decreased across the industry. Having 6-12 months of expenses saved provides genuine confidence because you can be selective about opportunities rather than accepting the first offer out of desperation.\n\nConsider contract or consulting work as bridge income rather than holding out exclusively for permanent positions. This keeps money coming in and often leads to full-time opportunities while maintaining your professional network.\n\nThe confidence issue often stems from comparing your situation to the boom years of tech hiring. The market has normalized into something more similar to other professional fields, which means standard job search strategies and realistic timelines matter more than they used to.",

That's not going to change.\n\nGiven that constant, we get a 2nd constant. You can't work with her. That's not going to change either.\n\nGiven those 2 constants, come up with your paths forward. There's not many, and they all rely on your skip.\n\nOne path that solves everything is your skip decides your manager is not performing well, and they fire them. You have no idea if they'll do this, and they're certainly not gonna talk about it with you, and even if they are going to do it this could easily take 6+ months. Maybe more.\n\nIf they don't do that, or you don't want to wait for something that may never happen, the next option is to tell your skip to transfer teams. *Tell*. You don't even need to explain yourself, they know whats up.\n\nIf they don't let you transfer teams, then your final option is to start looking for jobs elsewhere.\n\nThis won't be the last bad manager you encounter in your career. You won't be able to change this person. There's a reason it's a LinkedIN cliche to say \"employees don't leave companies, they leave managers\".",

They also usually do mock interviews, resume review etc., and it's good to have a solid handle on interviewing by the time you actually start doing it for internships.\n\nMy biggest suggestion would be to make a lot of friends in the your major. It's crazy how much of an edge knowing people gets you in the interview process. Make friends, friends graduate / have internships, gives you a leg in. This is so overlooked in CS in my opinion. Idk if it's just not generally understood, or if people willfully ignore it because they are super introverted and/or socially anxious, but seriously - make lots of friends. And have fun along the way, because life is short and uni is a really unique time of newly realized autonomy and freedom in our budding adult lives",

At that point, you can take the offer to your manager and decide what you want to do.\n\nIn the first 5 years of my career, I did this every year and either got a raise or switched jobs. I dont regret it. Also, one of those early managers who kept me on with a 20% raise is still a friend who I have worked with at 2 other companies since. I dont think any good manager will take it personally. And if they do, you dont want to work there anyway.",

Companies create BS policies so they can say in negotiations ‚Äúno, that goes against the policy we made‚Äù. Be prepared to hear that.\n\nPresent some labour force averages. Explain in your counter your current value (and recent big wins you‚Äôve given the company).\n\nAsking for 15-20% seems reasonable. Although, even if you get away with that, say a 15% raise, that probably means next pay adjustment period instead of getting a ~3% adjustment they‚Äôll just skip the raise and say ‚Äúwell you just got promoted and we gave you the extra little bit in negotiations‚Äù. In other words, it may just all wash out to not much in the end.\n\nAgain, I‚Äôm shellshocked. You describe a company with policies in place to let them be obstinate and slow in pay raises. Since they control and purse strings and the policies, they can always point at the policies they made and say their hands are tied. That‚Äôs my experience.",
