While that’s certainly true at many large companies like Meta or Amazon where you’re basically slinging SQL and little else, it’s most certainly not true at companies like Capital One or Airbnb or Netflix; there, your job is practically 1:1 with software engineering. That being said, a great percentage of DE’s need to study DSA, time/memory complexity, and CS fundamentals, instead of memorizing frameworks and assuming everything’s Gucci. It’s the fundamentals that evidently are the “hard stuff”.\n\nTo provide an actual metric that illustrates what I mean: at a company I will not name, I encountered a legacy process that took 55 hours but was reduced to 6.5 seconds, as well as ~5x less memory allocation, simply by using Aho-Corasick instead of regex, parallelization instead of serialization, and basic optimizations using concepts like “tidy data” and sets. That’s the difference between throwing SQL at everything and knowing when certain tools and techniques apply best or worst.",

You often need to ensure your pipelines will work (or at least fail gracefully) with bad data and not hang with huge amounts of data.\n\nYou also have to deal with external APIs or flat file transfers where your assumptions will be based on the documentation the external party provides. You quickly come to realise this documentation is often old or just plain incorrect so building a test suite on it is a lesson on futility.\n\nThis is obviously much harder to do than writing unit tests of your own code and when the pressures mount of delivering integrations and new data products to the business mount, testing can often fall by the wayside with data engineers falling back on \"we'll test it in live!\".\n\nThis, compounded by the fact that setting up a testing environment that truly represents your production database/data warehouse can be expensive and time consuming all combine to mean tests are a much less rigourously followed discipline in data engineering.\n\nDoes that mean you should skip them altogether? Absolutely not, but ensuring you have 100% unit test code coverage is not nearly as valuable as ensuring a complex pipeline has a decent set of integration and stress tests for, say, 75% of its functionality.\n\nThe reality is that most data engineers will be lucky to get anywhere near that, which is almost certainly why they were impressed you wrote tests at all. It should mean that you approach the challenges above with the right mindset, rather than just avoiding them because testing is hard on data engineering.",

Ideally you also have tests that can be run before you deploy into a test/integration environment, and more tests that you can run before you merge your code to the main branch.\n\nTests should be done as early as is reasonably possible, to detect errors and issues as soon as possible, so that people waste as little time as possible creating and then hunting down and fixing defects.\n\nThese tests are built on certain assumptions, positive or negative, then 'Given [x] When [y] Then [z]'. DQ checks are there to catch when your assumptions on 'given' and 'when' don't hold -- something gave you nulls when it shouldn't, or some new code value came in for a column that didn't exist before, or some formatted number had a format change. You can't check the output for various features to detect if something went horribly wrong, and you can halt the process or quarantine some data so that it doesn't corrupt everything.\n\nBut those DQ processes should themselves be tested. Do they correctly identify certain scenarios and actually halt the process (or do whatever other mitigating action you specify). Otherwise, where's the confidence that they actually work?",

        "body": "I feel like I’m being called to respond here. I remember you commenting something similar under one of my posts. I was planning to write a separate post to address it, but since you brought it up here first, here I am :)\n\nWe really should make a clear distinction between testing **imperative code** (like Python, Java, etc.) and **declarative code** (like SQL). There are some similarities, sure, but the overall intuition is quite different.\n\nProcedural code is much more detailed — it’s built to operate on small units of data or small transactions. You can stop execution at any point, inspect variables, and debug step by step. You have full control over dependencies, can inject mocks, and create true unit tests (It is all very well described by many books and authors).\n\nThat’s basically impossible in SQL-driven projects (which is what I’m talking about in my posts). Here tests are essentially black-box tests you're testing the outcome of a whole query or pipeline as it runs through the SQL engine. There’s no pausing mid-query or stepping through line by line.\n\nHere’s how I see the distinction in SQL-driven projects:\n\n* **Data tests** — I treat these as part of the models itself. Like you said, they run at runtime. I think of them as *assertions* that validate whether the model can handle certain inputs.\n\nIn imperative code, it would look something like this:\n\n    def foo(request):\n        if request is None:\n            raise Exception(\"Request cannot be null\")\n        if not is_request_valid_from_business_perspective(request):\n            raise Exception(\"Request is not valid in this context because of X, Y, Z\")\n    \n        do_actual_processing(request)\n\nThe actual processing code is only meant to work with data that’s already been validated. If the data doesn’t meet the criteria, we terminate early and skip that specific request.\n\nIn SQL-based projects, I see data tests playing the same role. The simple, built-in tests are kind of like basic assertions like `request is None`. More specific, custom tests are closer to the business logic checks, like `is_request_valid_from_business_perspective(request)`.\n\nThe difference is that we place the test on a previous model in relation to the one we're currently building, and we run it against the entire dataset — not just a single piece of data. Unfortunately, if it fails, it can bring down the whole build, unlike in transactional systems where only one transaction would fail.\n\n* **Unit tests** \\- These focus on verifying logic rather than the data itself. The goal is to ensure that a specific block of logic behaves as expected. Support for writing this kind of test is limited (it’s available in dbt, but I don’t find it particularly easy to use). Still, it can be useful for checking that complex conditional logic works correctly or that your regex patterns aren’t doing anything weird.\n* **Diff tests** – These run the whole pipeline with your new changes and compare how the exposures or main models differ between the old and new versions of the code. It’s kind of like an integration test. It’s especially useful for explaining to data consumers what changed and why those changes happened.\n\nThese are all the automated tests I use in analytical projects, and so far, this testing setup has been sufficient for all my needs.\n\nSo, in summary, I agree with the distinction you made. I think about data test in specific way, I am aware that this is a run time concept and use it there.",

My team tech lead comes from traditional ETL background and has done lot of modeling in his past. I still spend lot of time on the model naming conventions and establishing proper standards.

In my experience (mostly feeding business/analytics reports) having good tests for business logic is more useful than technical testing (like is this column nullable or unique, etc) because I'm trying to minimize scenarios where the data pipelines succeed but the numbers make no sense to business people and then the business complains or stops trusting the numbers. And I find a decent amount of issues with technical data quality will be noticeable immediately, like if you try to upsert with a duplicate PK, the pipeline will fail and you'll get a notification. \n\nIt seems like you have the perspective of a DE working in a tech minded company where tech/software is the product, so it makes sense to have the highest possible software quality. This is not the case for all non software companies, where having old and shitty software is the norm and asking for budget increases gets you laughed out of the room. This culture filters down into who gets hired and what tools get used, so the business ends up with worse quality engineering talent all else equal. Sometimes that blows up in the business's face, other times nothing bad happens for years. Those DEs probably aren't going to write tests because they don't see the benefits, are too lazy, are overworked, or don't have the budget (or some other excuse). idk if that answers your question but i think it describes reality a bit better than the strawman arguments the earlier commenters provided",

        "body": "I've been working on (and failing at, honestly) getting data engineers to adopt proper testing practices for ten years. Here's what I've observed:\n\n1.     **Legacy Systems and Technical Debt** Many organizations are stuck with legacy data architectures - monolithic data warehouses, batch ETL processes built years ago - that are incredibly difficult to modernize. The technical debt from years of ad hoc development makes implementing proper testing and observability feel like trying to retrofit a Formula 1 engine into a horse-drawn carriage. Migrating to modern cloud-native stacks requires significant investment that many companies aren't willing to make.\n\n2.     **Lack of Data Engineering Maturity** This is the big one. Most companies still treat data engineering as a back-office function rather than a core engineering discipline. You end up with a mess of one-off scripts, undocumented workflows, and manual interventions everywhere. Very few data teams practice basic software engineering principles like CI/CD, proper testing, or version control for their pipelines.\n\n3.     **Resistance to Cultural Change** Data teams have historically worked in silos - engineers, analysts, scientists, and business teams all doing their own thing. DataOps requires breaking down these silos and adopting agile methodologies, which is genuinely disruptive to existing workflows. Leadership has to drive this cultural shift, but most executives don't understand data engineering well enough to know what needs to change.  You need to test at every point on the data joureny\n\n4.     **Tooling Complexity & Vendor Overload** The data tooling landscape is overwhelming. Every vendor promises to solve all your problems, but integrating everything into a coherent, testable system is a nightmare.\n\n5.     **Lack of Automated Testing & Observability** This is where we really fail compared to software engineering. Data teams still rely on manual SQL checks instead of automated data quality pipelines. We have open source tools now - Great Expectations, , dbt tests, and my company's DataOps Data Quality TestGen - but adoption is still painfully slow.\n\n6.     **The Meaning of \"Testing\" is Confusing** This one drives me crazy. When software engineers talk about testing, they mean unit tests, integration tests, etc. that run during development and deployment. But in data engineering, \"testing\" could mean: Testing your code logic during development (like software engineers do), Testing data quality when new data arrives in production, Testing data at various points in the produict process.\n\n7.     **Do you test in development when code changes, or in production when data changes? The answer is YES to both**, but most teams don't distinguish between these different types of testing. This confusion leads to either over-engineering development tests or completely ignoring runtime data quality checks. We need both static code testing AND dynamic data testing, but the industry hasn't standardized the terminology or tooling around this distinction.\n\n8.     **Regulatory & Compliance Challenges** Compliance requirements often prioritize audit trails over engineering best practices, creating friction around automation.\n\n9.     **Lack of Executive Buy-In & ROI Justification** It's hard to quantify the ROI of \"preventing data disasters that haven't happened yet.\" Executives see testing as overhead rather than insurance.\n\nThe frustrating part is that we know how to solve these problems - the tools and methodologies exist. But changing organizational culture and overcoming years of technical debt is incredibly difficult. It's like trying to rebuild a plane while it's flying.",

It’s a great game and I would say very educational while still being very fun.\n\n I would say if you like gaming and you are an engineer, you are very likely to enjoy this game. Anedotally, I have yet to meet somebody who meets those criteria who doesn’t like factorio (or satisfactory for that matter). Note, if you don’t like gaming already then I am not sure.\n\nWhy is this the case? At its core its about automating things!\n\nYou basically have to create logistics pipelines that take raw materials, put them through various stages of processing to make things that can then be used to make other things. You have particular objectives that grow in complexity as the game goes on. \n\nIn the beginning you can get away with a spaghetti pipeline, but as the game goes on and complexity ramps up, it essentially forces you how to think modularly and in terms of abstractions and interfaces. So instead of working at the level of single processing units, you will eventually need to think at the level of many different processing units. Then you have to think through input rate, output rate etc etc. Other challenges you have to account for is being able to take input resources from different places as they run out! And it also has a bit of pragmatism in that in the core game mode you also have to defend yourself against aliens (product / manager analogy) so you can’t just put everything into building the perfect factory, also needs to be able to defend itself quickly.\n\nHope that gives you some idea!",

Once you're set up, proceed as follows:\n\n1. Open the **https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/**. For each problem, copy the sample data in a pandas-like format.\n2. Use an AI to convert the pandas data into PySpark DataFrame syntax.\n3. Solve each exercise using PySpark.\n\nAt the same time you can also move on to the **Northwind Database Exercises** [**https://github.com/eirkostop/SQL-Northwind-exercises**](https://github.com/eirkostop/SQL-Northwind-exercises), a repository containing a series of SQL problems with increasing difficulty. Load the database as  CSV files available here [https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/northwind-neo4j/tree/master/data](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/northwind-neo4j/tree/master/data), then tackle the problems one by one, solving each using PySpark.\n\nIf you manage to complete all of these exercises, you'll be well-prepared to handle a wide range of real-world  problems using PySpark.\n\n# Theoretical:\n\nIf you're less interested in programming details at this moment, feel free to skip implementation sections and focus solely on the conceptual and architectural aspects in the following books:\n\n1. *Learning Spark* (2nd Edition)\n2. *Spark: The Definitive Guide*\n3. *(Optional)* *Hadoop: The Definitive Guide.* Although Hadoop is largely legacy, Spark can be seen as its spiritual successor. Understanding Hadoop's core ideas will provide useful historical and architectural context.\n\nGet into the habit of inspecting your Spark jobs and ask AI to help you understand them. Use the **Spark UI** to analyze execution details, and call `df.explain()` to understand your transformations.\n\nFinally, explore articles, and videos specifically focused on **Spark’s distributed architecture** and execution model. A deep understanding of how Spark handles computation across a cluster is crucial to writing efficient and scalable applications.\n\nIf you need anything, send me a private message and I can help you.",

A simple one in relative terms, but simple is good so long as it meets your needs. Some orgs need a much more complex data warehouse.\n\nApache Spark is probably what you're thinking of for Apache: it's a software system for using multiple computers to do a computational task, instead of being restricted to the hardware of just one computer. Many lower-spec computers can outperform and outprice one big one, for some workloads.\n\nBigQuery is one of Google's data tools - I think roughly like spark but I'm not super familiar with it.\n\nData Factory probably refers to Microsoft's data tools: Azure Data Factory and its spiritual successor, Fabric Data Factory. These are components of wider data architecture in the Microsoft/Azure/Fabric ecosystem, for creating 'pipelines', which are just conceptual sequences of different tasks depending on one another. Pipelines typically have a code representation but are often also able to be visualised and edited via a GUI.\n\nETA: I don't think you are at all new to data engineering, you just didn't realise you were doing it 🙂",

Fail fast, if you will. \n\nThis means understanding your source data fields and testing them. This is especially true for json blobs where nested keys are expected to hold json data, only to find that the API actually returns null values or different nested values or keys based on other keys in the blob - yay. \n\nBut achieving this is not easy. You need to get in contact with the business owner / data owner to understand the fields and the business rules (and what they mean). And you need to ensure you've got signoff prior to deploying the pipeline, so that any failures can be reviewed with them before you make your pipeline constraints more lenient. Trust me. \n\nBut, the myth of \"we will fix it in post\" is real, and never actually happens once the next pipeline comes your way. Post-fixing methodologies are essentially like adding a second etl to your pipeline - which you will also need to maintain, and it's totally abstracted away from the source data pipeline now. \n\nMost analytics is quite removed from production systems, and business/ stakeholders want their data NOW. But part of any data pipeline is the \"people pipeline\", connecting people from the relevant domains into a single conversation so that parties can understand the risks and uncertainties and the business rules. \n\nBut, if you only build pipelines and you don't care about what happens after you give the data to people, or you don't care about the teams who need to use the data, then just build tests against your destination schema constraints. Bonus shortcut, just exclude all records that fail the test and magically your pipeline never fails. Business will think you're a rockstar! \n\nI strongly encourage KYD.",

Then, half a year later, after adding new logic, it failed right away pointing that something went wrong.   \n\n\n**Regression testing** could be the most rewarding.

In most dataset this won’t be an issue at all and you guarantee that your pipeline or the source didn’t generate duplicates data which happens a lot because of a lot of reason or just because of reprocess of the ingestion.\n\nYou can test for expected values but I only have bad luck with those because the data we play with change a lot. Unless  your datasets are very deterministic or doesn’t change a lot I wouldn’t go there. Unless there’s an action do to on your end if you receive a new value.\n\nYou can test for data continuity (try to find holes). That help a lot. Most systems aren’t fully sequential because you need that all part of the pipeline support sequential task to deliver you data sequentially which is not the most common. For example at the moment you rely on s3 events, you’ve just lost your ordering. Can be interesting to build things in order but also to find missing data.\n\nAnd like you said, build test right (closer to your business domain tables), then shift left (closer to the source of data) anytime it’s possible. It’s usually easier to build a test that apply to a specific domain use case because you know what you want and expect. And it’s always better to test closer to the source.",

For one, and before AI generating code, they were mainly implemented to solve scalability problems that not every company will have. Why put everything in code? Why version control? Why CI/CD? Why SSoT for metrics / semantic layer? Etc etc. These are super hard to explain until you can demonstrate the consequences of not doing them. So naturally, people will lump them into the same boat as shiny new features designed to churn profit. Good thing is, with AI everyone is suddenly open to change if it helps them implement AI. Bad news is, there is a lot of smoke and mirrors (like reselling chatgpt or throwing AI at bad data) that will make it harder to convince people of change if/when it crashes.",

However, even with lots of optimization, this isn't what Snowflake excels at.\n\nRegarding pricing: As you pay mainly for storage and warehouse uptime, there are no specific caveats. Regarding scaling, it would possibly make more sense to scale-out (more XS warehouses to serve requests in parallel). \n\nWhat we did is performing the transformations in Snowflake and export a denormalized table, and imported it into a Postgres. Which achieves <100 ms response times for 50+ attributes per record paginated with 100 records out of 1.5b records even on a very small configuration. \n\nHowever, within the last 12 months, a couple of things changed:\n1. Introduction of hybrid tables allowing Snowflake to perform better on OLTP tasks - we haven't tried this out yet as we are on Azure, and hybrid tables are on GA only on AWS\n2.

You don't always see the effort others put in, and people who go down the road of attacking their superiors are almost always wrong, and usually get blacklisted or fired, so keep your head down and focus on your own work. Again, not sure if this is your tone, but the advice stands in case it's ever relevant.\n2. Get the idea of \"X hours worked\" out of your head now while you're hourly (Even though that is your whole world as an intern). You are all there to perform a service -- if that service is performed in 30 hours per week, then 10 hours is spent doing useless busywork to appear productive. But you'll have plenty of times when there's an emergency deadline and you're pulling 60 hours, that's what \"exempt\" (salary) means. You say you see them leave early, but did you see them crash on the couch in the lobby during the audit last year?\n3. There are no gold stars, rewards, raises, or bonuses for working harder/longer than contractually obligated. Especially at a company of 3,700 employees. And even more especially as a DE, your contributions will go with little more than a \"Thanks!\" if not completely unnoticed. The only time you will be \"seen\" is when something goes *wrong*, like a plumber or electrician.\n\nTLDR: Keep your head down, do your job, and hope that your future in DE is as \"relaxed\" as you seem to think it might be.",

When we shift to corporate, there will be politics involved or there will be some culture that you have to adopt. \n\nIn this case, sounds like the culture is not that good. You might not be culture fit. But it doesn’t mean that your bad or you underperform. It’s just that the company’s culture don’t fit your values. \n\nWorking outside shift hours is bad. There has to be some level of respect there. Not unless the role requires an on-call responsibility. \n\nDon’t be too hard on yourself, brother. \n\nOn the other hand, there are also some factors that might contribute to your situation. \n\nIt might be possible that your communication style ia different from the the comm style of your boss or your peers. \n\nFor example, there are some people who don’t respond via email. They respond via chat. You mentioned that you tagged your boss on a doc and he seemed to miss that. So, that might be an issue. Adjust to your boss’ comm style. If he wants a chat, then do so. His email might be swamp with a lot of emails so your email might be burried in his inbox. \n\nAnother thing is, in start ups autonomy is the usual culture. In corporate, it’s not always the case. There will be a lot of times that you have to have buyins from certain stakeholders. Even your boss. You need to push for approvals and sell the idea to them. Culture is really different. \n\nOn the issue of passive-aggressiveness. I might be wrong on this one but have you spoken to your boss lately? Have you communicated your concerns? One possible reason that it looks like passive-agressiveness is that you don’t speak enough with your boss.\n\nIn startups, speed is usually name of the game. In corporate, you can only do so much until your boss approves it. \n\nLastly, communicate always your work. It’s important that you become visible to your boss and he’s aware about what you do. \n\nIf everything still fails, even if have communicated everything, then it might be the time to loom for another company, specially if it affects your mental health.",

A good observability tool can help establish a baseline and notify you if something changes.  \n\\- Some data sources have fairly irregular schedules, with frequent ingest during work hours, batch updates during the night, and no updates during weekends and holidays. You often end up with very loose freshness tests because you can't combine freshness with a cron.\n\nThe setup can be as simple or as difficult as you want. In the simple case, just create a service user for the SaaS and watch the dashboard populate. In the advanced case, you can spend months writing custom yaml tests in MonteCarlo, integrating Airflow webhooks, etc.\n\nThe crux with the more advanced tools that actually use ML is that they notify you of anomalies over slack, and they then expect you to tell them if this is an actual anomaly. When you set it up it just observes for a week or two, assuming that whatever you see during this period is normal. After this, you will probably start receiving a lot of notifications of possible anomalies. If your team is able to check with some domain expert, you can give the underlying ML model good input and over a few weeks there will be way fewer false positives.\n\nIf you don't have access to someone who can tell you if an anomaly is an error or not, these tools will be very annoying. If you do, you probably also have a good shot at writing meaningful dbt tests.\n\nThe more simple tools are more annoying. The anomaly detection is often a simple Z-statistic, so there is little chance of reducing false positives (other than accumulating more history). On the plus side, the simple tools are often open source or open core.\n\nLastly, a few questions to keep in mind:  \n\\- What types of failures are you looking for? Is it silent failures in the data ingest pipeline you created? Is it upstream changes to data structures, odd content etc that might stem from an error in a different system?  \n\\- What do you want from it? Is it for the DE team to check possible errors in their own system? Is it to notify users of possible issues?  \n\\- What is your tolerance level for false positives?  \n\\- How much effort is it to check out a possible anomaly?\n\nNone of these projects ended up seeing the observability tool as an indispensable tool. From what I can remember, there was one or two cases where the tool caught an issue before anyone else. But they are expensive, and there are mostly false positives.",

Nothing of immediate concern, but something you may want to keep in mind.\n\nA while ago I had similar requirements but used Dagster on a VM for orchestration and hosting dbt (also storing data in blob storage), so I avoided Azure Data Factory and Azure Functions.

        "body": "Your architecture has a solid foundation, leveraging Azure's capabilities effectively. Using Azure Functions to handle different API endpoints is beneficial for scalability, while Azure Blob Storage serves as a flexible intermediary. However, consider integrating Azure Data Lake for more efficient data storage and retrieval, especially if data volume grows. Using dbt to manage transformations is great, as it provides modularity and enhanced version control, but ensure proper testing and documentation of SQL procedures to avoid potential pitfalls. Automating more aspects of your pipeline, like error handling and monitoring through Azure Monitor, could also improve robustness.\n\nYour pipeline design appears efficient, but here are some areas for improvement. Directly loading JSON into staging tables is fine, but you might want to explore the use of [Delta Lake](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/how-to-create-delta-live-tables-in-azure-databricks?utm_source=pawan&utm_medium=reddit) for its ACID transactional integrity and improved efficiency in handling large datasets. Additionally, you can enhance the scalability of your Azure Functions by moving them to Azure Kubernetes Service if your function apps face heavy workloads. Incorporating better data validation mechanisms before data transformation can save time troubleshooting downstream inaccuracies. Finally, enhancing your logging and monitoring setup, possibly integrating [Azure Log Analytics](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/building-data-pipelines-with-azure-synapse-analytics?utm_source=pawan&utm_medium=reddit), will provide better insights and faster response times to issues that may arise.",

When a schema change for column addition is needed, we make sure they're ok for us to add columns without changes on their end, and do so. Once that data is ready, they can make changes on their end to bring in the new column(s). Avoiding coordinated change windows is the key, because it causes immense difficulty when working across teams.\n\nIf a column is being removed, we essentially do the reverse. Downstream removes their dependency on it, then we remove it. If this ever has to be inverted, then the new first-moving team needs to set up a view or some other 'dummy' mechanism to spoof the presence of the data, so that they can make their change now and let the other team catch up later.\n\nFor ingestion we make use of lake storage -- we capture raw data and raw files, exactly as upstream provides them. We read the data as long as it is compatible, it does not have to be identical, but we do flag for changes in schema as they will need to be addressed. After read, we write to conformed tables that use a schema we set, so we can add in dummy data or drop columns as needed. Ideally upstream works with us and provides two copies when a change is happening, one in the old schema and another in the new, then we can switch over at any point (ie they are first mover in this scenario).",

You have to come up with a business case that makes changing the format worth it. BTW, cost savings are a terrible way to start a discussion to get money. Figure out how to make more money by changing the file format and you may have something.\n2. We have heard all about the coming of semi-structured or unstructured data for years. Like cold fusion, it is just 20 years away. PDFs are a horrible way to move data. They are designed for how the information looks, not how it is held. You wouldn't believe the number of escape sequences are used to make PDFs look good. Those are very hard to get the data out of. Ask your local data scientist how much they love pulling data out of PDFs. They'll tell you it sucks. The first step to using them is to get the info out of the PDF into text and then try to make it work.\n3. Not even close. 90% of what you hear about these \"coming technologies\" is marketing BS.

You can pick optimization and DB internals along the road -- you don't get to read the source code of modern DWH plus you probably won't be able to read them anyway, and most of the optimization guides are just a few web pages so you only need to memorize and understand those. And since you are just ingesting data into DWH, most likely you don't need to write raw ingestion code -- and even if you do, it is going to be way smaller scale than Netflix.\n\nBasically the task falls into two parts:\n\n\\- Gathering requirements from stakeholders and make sure you clarify every question before moving into implementation stage. It's difficult and sometimes impossible, depending on the quality of the stakeholders, most of whom don't know what they want anyway.\n\n\\- Put up tests, alerts and monitoring into each pipeline.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Apparently the people part is way more important and difficult than the technical part. It's essentially sort of BI analyst job.\n\nOh and good luck on Fabric.",

SQL Server DBA here so I know exactly what you’re talking about 😏 Well, not the DuckLake parts but the rest of it 😏  Like where’s the equivalent of an SSDT project here?!\n\nTake a look at SQLMesh. It supports and/or replaces dbt. It has column type tracking / lineage between all of those databases and a few more!\n\nTo summarise, you define a SQL model in SQLMesh (just a file with a select statement… model (name xxx); select blah from y), it works out what the source tables are by querying the source database, and caches them in a yaml file (it’s also a one command line to regenerate this at any time, so it’s no big deal at all, you can also easily parse it by hand or script because it’s so basic, literally just the table name column name and data type). \n\nNow for any more references to those tables or that model or other models and nested models etc it tracks the lineage downwards. If you have it materialize the views it calculates all the data types of the tables to create, or you can also manually define and override them, or keep the whole thing as just views.\n\nIt has a VS Code extension that shows you all of the column types in your models while you’re coding, too. It has an API (of sorts) you can call to scrape it into other applications as well (but that part is a bit funny; because you need to run it in UI mode which opens a local 8080 port, and you query that… easier than it sounds).\n\nAnyway have a look just to see if it does what you want. \n\nOne last thing though. F MAX column types in SQL Server 😅 Those are LOB types so every single row query will cause an additional lookup for every LOB column in it. That quickly *kills* performance even in a data warehouse 😅 Oh it’s okay for CSV files and stuff where you can’t be sure what the limits are… I get that part… but in general it’s a big no 😅",

The inability in dbt contracts of being able to do varchar(n) max length type checks - I come from a MS SQL server backgorund and am used to defining max field lengths for most text columns. This one is interesting though - I'm going to be using postgres for the database for the first time and I have just realised the strict varchar(n) types I'm useed to aren't really needed for the majority of columns because text / varchar data types will suffice - so it's less of a concern now. \n\n2. I saw it as likely being a better debugging experience to pick up schema errors by tests (rather than using contracts which prevent the models from creating - although I get it that's what you'd want to happen). I'll also be creating other tests for expected values etc, so having all tests implemented the same way I saw as a cleaner apprach\n\n3. I just don't like the amount of yaml that gets created to implement schema checks via contracts (I think this is actually my biggest gripe). My first ingest pipeline has 30 files and some of them have 60+ columns - that is a lot of yaml needed not to mention dbt best practsies suggest putting it all in a single schema.yml file! That sounds a PITA for developers to maintain. Diffing metadata .schema changes in a small seed file is easy.",

Only attend meetings that are directly relevant to your work and drop after your piece is done. Time box your schedule. I am talking about going through the acceptance criteria in the tickets and only doing that in the simplest way possible with no creativity. If you're getting all of your work done well and on time your manager shouldn't have an issue. It's obvious you are burnt out.",

That’s how I made the transition work pretty seamlessly. Obviously I spent lots of time outside of work learning on the side but here was the career path I took:\n\nManufacturing engineer: I had a few roles before this that were more design focused and even though I hated manufacturing it was vital experience to get my foot in the door for the next step.\n\nAutomation Engineer: worked and learned alongside controls engineers and IT networking experts to bring data from machines to databases for various use cases. Learned some PLC programming (don’t really use it now), a lot about networking and various data transfer protocols, and a lot of data modeling/reporting. I also got the chance to use some of my own data that I collected to mess around and try to build machine learning predictive maintenance models. The models didn’t perform well (for reasons outside my own control), but I learned a lot. I got much better at both SQL and Python and general problem solving.\n\nData/Analytics Engineer: with all the experience I gained from my previous role I was able to make my way into a junior data role by taking a pay cut and just speaking really passionately about data (which I genuinely am). Since then I’ve learned a shit ton about good programming principles/procedures, working in a platform like Databricks, and how to communicate with business partners about data projects.\n\nI’ve since been promoted in this role and absolutely love the work that I do. I find it engaging and I continue to learn every day. If you have additional questions let me know but I hope this helps a bit.",

However, there are so many details or problems you need to consider when you are working a real-life project, and some of them are extremely critical for interviews. The lack of depth in their course design (because it's only three months) means you need to take the initiatives to explore way more than they provide to you within the curriculum, which also stands if you enrolled an expensive bootcamp. I was asked a system design question during an interview to design a real-time pipeline, so get prepared for a decent resume, different problems or challenges you might encounter during a project, lots of SQL questions, Python  programming questions (maybe not Leetcode style), and system design questions.\n\n  \nP.S, in my opinion, sometimes I tend to ignore some people's advice like getting a CS degree or get a job in the data field first. I am not saying they're wrong, but their suggestions are based on their background and experience. It stands 10 years or 5 years ago, but nowadays even CS new grads are also struggling to get a job, some people became a DE because there were so many opportunities.

When something goes wrong, it's challenging right now to even answer what this table looked like yesterday. \n\nI'm thinking right now of an observer service and an anomaly service at least and have it extensible for different source types (Snowflake, S3) and table types (raw source, transformed source, transformed model). Checks happen on a cron-friendly cadence but at least once a day. Maybe even configurable indepdently by source, path, table or check type. Is it opt-in or opt-out?\n\nWould love to hear more about how you are thinking about it! I'm just starting to formulate my thoughts about it. And before any vendors come at me, don't bother, you're barking up the wrong tree :).\n\nEdit: I should amend this to say that we have a LOT of dbt tests and we are very good about defining a unique key and testing on it (not null and unique) so we generally know about fan-out problems but I'm more thinking the silent failures. Something is null all of sudden or data volume drops off a cliff or there is a significant skew in the most frequent values in recent data, amounts skyrocketing due to math errors, etc. Logic has changed somewhere so how can you be very certain that the downstreams aren't silently negatively affected.",

IP bans and CAPTCHA hell can kill productivity fast.\n\nFor managed services vs building your own, it really depends on your budget and control needs. We use a hybrid approach - managed services like what you mentioned for the heavy lifting (proxy rotation, CAPTCHA solving) but we build our own orchestration layer on top.                                                                                                   Few things that have saved us headaches: Data format standardization is huge. We preprocess everything into a common schema before it hits our main pipeline. Saves tons of downstream issues.                                                      For retries, exponential backoff with jitter works well, but also build in circuit breakers for sites that go completely down. No point hammering a dead endpoint.                                                                                                        Cost wise, managed services can get expensive fast if you're not careful about request volumes. We monitor spend daily and have hard limits set.\n\nOne thing to watch with webhook delivery make sure you have proper queuing on your end. We learned that the hard way when a client's scraping job flooded our ingestion endpoints.\n\nAlso consider the legal side. Some sites are getting more aggressive about scraping ToS enforcement. Worth having clear data usage agreements with your stakeholders.\n\nWhat kind of volumes are you looking at? That usually determines if managed makes sense vs rolling your own infrastructure.",

It helped because what would otherwise have been an individual topic only had a small trickle of records with occasional bursts -- not enough to justify running a separate streaming ingestion job for each, nor to handle the overhead of parquet+deltalake over individual row writes.\n\nSo we bundled everything into one big stream with a wrapper around each event to indicate which type it was, which just helped with later processing.\n\nThe advantage for us is we could run each downstream job on any schedule we wanted, all the data was there in the big ingestion table. Technically there is overhead with reading all the other data, but compared to reading directly off of kafka (or similar) it was still much faster to pull off lake storage.\n\nAnother advantage was the sharing of overhead on the streaming size. Basically all the topics combined shared the same overhead or cluster oversizing, so while an individual 'topic' might burst to 10x traffic, since it only makes up 10% of the overall bandwidth, it would not shift performance demands too much. It kept usage reasonably predictable.\n\nLow latency use cases still ran off the original topics. The combined one was just for long term storage and batch processes.",

        "body": "I think there are two data \"engineering\" worlds that are completely separate from each other.\n\nThe first world is the one that leans  towards software engineering (well, it is software engineering, just with a focus on moving large amounts of data). This is the Kafka, Spark, Hadoop, Flink, Druid, NoSQL world. You would use these tools to complete projects such as real time data streaming, distributed computing, and moving petabytes of data around.\n\nCompanies with a need to move massive amounts of data have use for this kind of data engineering: FAANG, Airbnb, Uber, and other companies that have serious needs to move petabytes of real time data and shit like that.\n\nThe other side is BI and Analytics. This kind of data engineering can feature some code through use of APIs but nothing like the distributed computing Spark jobs and Kafka. Getting data for analytics is a lot more chill. Data doesn't have to be real time, maybe once a day or a week suffices. Stored procedures can reliably move large sets of data around. The skill set here is about analytics and SQL. No python, no system design, no fancy algorithm. It becomes more so a practice in how good you are at understanding the business, using that knowledge to analyze the data, and finally reporting on those connected dots with services like SSRS, Tableua, and Sigma, etc.\n\nNow, the HTML/CSS and Flask stuff is more like a back-end/full-stack Python engineering skill set. Throw in ReactJS for that front end your working and that's pretty much full-stack software development. I would try and figure out what you want to do first. \n\nJust remember: BI and Analytics data engineering is way different from the software engineering-esque data jobs.",

A webpage stored locally that can only display information isn’t useful, so technologies were developed to solve these issues, which increased complexity. Honestly, an interesting simile to your observation would be, why do we need C/C++ if we could do everything in Assembly, which is the simplest language.

The reason why complexity exists, is because we have more complex problems.\n\nThe tools and frameworks developers use that are “complex” actually have streamlined a lot of issues for us.

Because you're not starting from scratch, you're hooking into a long-living, already existing framework and ecosystem for creating applications, with well-defined and delineated structures to organize your program to ensure it works within the framework.\n\nYou would see similar levels of triviality if you tried to make a \"bare metal\" web application with native javascript and HTML, as well, the complexity comes in when you pick up a framework, because you're CHOOSING that complexity in exchange for the power the framework offers you. Same with servers, you can write your own bare-bones HTTP server in C++ and simply use that as a REST-API handler, but that's a lot of tedious work... why would you do that when ready-made frameworks exist that, yes, take a bit more work to get started with, but over time drops your workload by a hundred times?\n\nMobile platforms are different because they REQUIRE you to use their platform to be able to run your applications and ensure they don't do \"bad things\", you cannot do \"bare metal\" development. These platforms are hardware limited, run fundamentally different \"operating systems\", and have a much higher level of integration and centralized control than a PC. This requires you to break up your applications into event-driven models, state-based triggers, setting structures and sign up for all the functionality you want to hook into so that the OS can integrate these things, ensure you get your fair share of background time, and run your app in the correct situations. You *can* do close to native app development if you jailbreak Android, and skip all the framework stuff if you really want to, but you won't be able to run on a locked down, consumer platform.\n\nYou will see that over time as you get more experienced with development and the applications you write get more substantial, you will either gravitate towards the same level of complexity, or you will be stuck doing so much manual work and trying to ensure it all works with each other that you drop it entirely because you get sick of it. Raw SDL is fine if what you're doing is fairly simple, a few UI elements there, a sprite there, but once you get beyond a certain level of complexity you'll either be wrapping it in your own engine, starting to use a framework yourself, or you \"muscle through\" it and create an unholy abomination that's a mess to work with.",

In the old days demonstrated by the console programs that you’ve been playing with you have ASSCII printable characters (the letters you see for instance like a, b, c, etc.) and the non-printable characters like carriage return (CR) that return the cursor to the beginning of the line, new line (NL) that advance the cursor to the next line below, etc. All very easy to control with basic system calls.\n\nEnter GUIs where it’s not that simple. With a GUI you have to define what is called a draw or layout surface that allows you to place elements like text boxes, buttons, etc at various positions within that draw surface. That overall draw surface is stored in the form of a series of buffers or layers to present to the user visually and a further layer to track finger touches or mouse cursor movements so the system can track what the user want to interact with. Now, with SDKs they need to handle a lot of the overall setup for you and you utilize objects that represent text or buttons or other widgets that place on that surface.\n\nNow as you can see we have gone from simple system calls to print text to screen for your console apps to presenting a presentation layer for GUI elements that cannot only rely on system calls alone to display.\n\nThis is why a simple hello world program on Android is so difficult because:\n\n1. You need to set up a display buffer with the resolution and how it will be displayed to the user\n2. You need to create a text box element in that buffer to display the text\n3. You need to set up what text is displayed in that text element\n\nI hope this gives you a good idea in answer to your question.",

        "body": "Despite the emphasis on computer code as something that does something in a computer, what it also fundamentally is an expression of human thought. (That's not as pretentious as it sounds. Pretty much any thing else expressive is, especially if it involves language, like a song or even this post.)\n\nWhen you look at someone else's code, you're looking at how they expressed their ideas in a form that can be executed on a computer. Different people will have different takes on that, even for the same problem. (That's one reason why one person's code may make immediate sense and someone else's doesn't - it can very much depend on whether you're thinking about the problem the same way they are or not.) So a key part of being able to read someone else's code is to approach it from a \"what were they thinking when they wrote this\" point of view. One of the first things you can do to help understand the code is identify what concepts they're expressing in the code - what the various players are, so to speak. The sooner you can grasp the bigger picture and what ideas are involved, the easier it will be once you get down into the details.\n\nOne thing that will help you over time is having more and more exposure to different ideas. If you're looking at an HTTP server implementation, for example, it will make a lot more sense if you've seen one before, so you know what things are and how they interact. So a big part of being able to more readily understand code is having already been exposed to the concepts its trying to express, even if later it's expressed in a way you haven't seen before. You can know what the underlying ideas are.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where a lot of documentation comes up short. The individual calls makes sense once you have a broader view - the big picture - but the documentation often seems to start from the (unspoken) point of view that you already know all that. So you end up having to try to work out it's an elephant and not a tree or a snake.\n\nWhat will make reading code easier over time is:\n\n\\- Seeing (and understanding) enough code that can know the various idioms and, more importantly, what they *mean*. That is, what the developer was most likely trying to say when they wrote the code.\n\n\\- Gaining knowledge in the domains the code is a solution for, so you can know what things mean more readily and can more quickly get the lay of the land once you dive in.\n\n\\- Writing more code yourself. Discovering how *you* express ideas will give you critical insight into how *others* express ideas in code. Eventually, you'll get to a point where you'll be able to see code and go \"I know what that means\" because you've not only seen it before but written it yourself before.\n\nHope that helps!\n\n\\[Note: Not all code is going to be so easily digested, even with experience. Some code is poorly written. Some software developers are insane. You can only work with what you're given. :) )",

Not only that, RAM cache is also very critical for performance, and hash tables are nearly always inferior to simple arrays when it comes to hitting cache. For performance there is also the idea of branching - in simple terms: whether or not the CPU can guess correctly if an if-statement will be true or false. Due to that you want as little if-statements as possible in performance critical areas, and i think all practical implementations of hash-tables have if-statements.\n2. Hash tables usually dont have order. If i want sorted data and often return the smallest/biggest member or a rank related to size, Hash tables are useless. Even simple strings have meaning to their order. EDIT: i dont think you can actually achieve order in hash-tables without a complementary list/array.\n3. You may need/want to use stack memory instead of heap memory and hash tables are hard and inefficient to implement using only stack memory.\n4. hash-tables pre-allocate chunks of memory before its ever used. if you want to save on memory you may want a different ADT.\n\nWith that being said, when you mostly care about average case big O notations, hash-tables are pretty amazing. This is why they are often used in leet-code questions.",

Honestly you can get by for a very long time without knowing anything about trees or graphs, or Big-O notation - and I have yet to meet the person who actually *had* to implement quicksort or any other sorting algorithm from memory (and didn't just do it because it was a fun exercise).\n\nI think DSA is fun, and like everything else in programming it gives you a whole new perspective on how to think about data, and it helps you understand and implement well-known algorithms - but the idea that you MUST know how and why quicksort or red black trees work, that's just ridiculous.\n\nLike a carpenter doesn't have to be a wood scientist, a programmer doesn't have to be a computer scientist, because Computer Science isn't programming - it is the study of how computers can be programmed to perform computations. And vice versa - just because you can provide a mathematical proof that your sorting algorithm will perform in O(n log n) it doesn't mean that you can implement the feature that the customer asks for.",

Many important data structures are defined recursively. For example, linked list is either null or a structure that contains some data and a pointer to a linked list. And when you have recursive data structures, recursive functions are often the best way to work with them.\n\n3. Recursion isn’t just some academic exercise. Consider a GUI framework. Typically, anything that’s drawn on the screen is drawn in a *view*. Controls, labels, text fields, menus, etc. are all specialized views. If a user clicks the mouse button, the framework figures out which view was clicked by asking the root view which view contained the click location. That view then asks each of its sub views which view contained the click, and so on. Or, if part of the screen needs to be redrawn, the framework goes through a similar process.\n\n4. Any problem that can be solved recursively *can* be solved iteratively, but recursion is often the easier, cleaner solution. Recursion uses the stack to keep track of intermediate results; things can get messy fast with iteration because you have to manage that state explicitly.\n\n5. There are some languages in which recursion is the only way to loop.\n\n6. If you’re working on a computer science degree, you probably have courses in theory of computation, compilers, and operating systems in your future. Recursion looms large in each of those. As a small example, read about the `fork()` function in Unix-like operating systems.\n\n7. Your question reminds me of high school math classes when students would ask “why do we need to know trig identities?” or “when are we ever going to factor polynomials in the real world?” It’s easy to understand that feeling, but it’s hard to provide a satisfying answer because someone asking a question like that just hasn’t seen enough to appreciate the importance of the topic. I think the best thing you can do is write your question down now and come back to it in a few years, after you’ve taken more advanced courses. That goes back to item #1 on this list: trust your professors, they know a lot more than you do.",

You need to learn and practice it (even if it initially feels awkward and even if some examples feel alien or niche). Then, when you face real world problems, sometimes you'll realise that, hey, it kind of feels like if I split this problem up into pieces the algorithm will be simpler or the code cleaner...and maybe I can do that again in the same way...hey, this is recursion! I'm recursing! And when your problems don't nest that way, go back to ordinary imperative code.\n\nKinds of data where recursion comes up naturally are common.

SDL is a pretty good choice for a cross-platform sound playing library even though it's intended for games.\n4. Lay out the project directory as well as bolt together all of the libraries I need, and for a windowed application, make some kind of \"Hello, world!\" window.\n5. Do the rest of the work. I would likely consider that I'm going to need a SongPlayer class and a Playlist class and code those things up accordingly, then from there's it's wiring up button callbacks and updating the state of the window.",

Conforming to industry standards just makes everything easier. For example, many JS network libs (like Axios) understand that a HTTP status code of 400 is an error response and will throw an error on the client.

        "body": "I am of the camp that outside the most common status codes, no, you should not use most of the status codes that exist, because most of them have niche semantics that won't be applicable to you or are used in specific subprotocols that ride on top of HTTP like WebDAV, or HTTP extensions. Perhaps a 200 for an error is not OK, but I would prefer an API with consistent error responses to one that abuses 20 different HTTP statuses all slightly incorrectly. Same thing with HTTP verbs.\n\nMost HTTP status codes are designed to describe outcomes related to the transport itself rather than the business logic that is behind it, and as such, HTTP status codes should be used to describe issues that occur prior to any form of processing or side effect and past that you should fall back to a very small subset of statuses to describe the outcome. That is what a body is for.. \n\nThe problem with this tends to be when people have to shoehorn complex behaviour into a single endpoint due to reasons outside their control, and they start abusing other HTTP status codes (especially WebDAV codes) to try and communicate their intent for things like partial success, or precondition failure, or side effects. They then do not realise half the HTTP status codes have strict and specific semantics about things like headers that should be included with them, and they break the rules of the spec by using them, which is far worse than just not using them at all. HTTP was not originally designed for requesting that Amazon sends you a new bag of cat food, it was designed for asking Amazon to show you a webpage about cat food.\n\nThere is then confusion on what describes a client versus a server error. Does a 400 purely specify that a request looks okay, or does it imply that the actual data it represents is meaningful in terms of the current system state and data that is stored? Do you expect a server to start processing your request prior to giving a 400 back? Does bad request purely describe the request itself or the implication of that request? Do you consider a 500 to mean something went wrong during processing or just that your server is fucked? \n\nOnce you get into the rabbithole of trying to work out exactly when each code is valid, you realise the system you are integrating with made a totally different decision on how to organise this and interpret it differently.\n\nThe other issue is that some HTTP libraries made the somewhat braindead decision to throw exceptions when you get certain status codes, and this then makes integration more difficult. Really what you are often communicating is semantically tied to your own system, and if that is the case, using the body to communicate that rather than the status code can be more sensible.\n\nEven from a monitoring perspective, anything significant will be relying on application metrics rather than metrics from load balancers to determine system health. Load balancer metrics for status codes just give a rough idea of how much stuff is working versus not working.\n\nTLDR: 400, 401, 403, 404, 2xx, 500, 503 are OK. Use those as you will. Anything more complicated that is related to business logic should just be in a 200 or 500 and detail the issue in the body. Abusing other codes like 422, 423, 507 just because they \"sound like\" what you want is far worse than just using vague codes. If you are giving me a 479 Shits Fucked Yo designed to be used with WebFTP v2.718281828459045 from 1943, or a 486 Its Tuesday that Twitter used once, then I have a problem. Using 200 for errors might be controversial but if it is easier to do that and provide consistent responses in the body across your systems, then go for it. Whether you are checking a status code inside or outside a body, most programming languages use the same constructs to inspect it. If using a 3 digit number at the start of a response is what people think defines usability, then they are just gatekeeping unless there is an actual technical requirement for it.",

I’ve been in a similar boat, where the hands-on stuff takes priority, but then you start hitting roadblocks in interviews or realizing there are gaps in your understanding of core concepts.\n\nFirst off, don’t beat yourself up too much. You’ve already got a solid understanding of how to get things done in real-world scenarios, which is a huge plus. The next step is just filling in those gaps in theory and fundamentals.\n\nOne option could be looking into free or low-cost online resources. There are a ton of high-quality materials out there. Sites like Coursera, edX, or freeCodeCamp offer courses that dive into algorithms, data structures, and other core topics. If you're feeling motivated enough to try something more structured, CS50 from Harvard is an amazing free intro to computer science.\n\nAnother suggestion is tackling coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal. They’ll help you get comfortable with algorithmic thinking and test your understanding of fundamental concepts like recursion, dynamic programming, and graph theory. It can be tough at first, but it’s a great way to get that theory-practice balance.\n\nAs for motivation, maybe set up a study routine that combines theory with practical application—like, for example, learn a concept in theory, then solve problems related to it. It’ll help you connect the dots and see the real-world value of what you're learning.\n\nIn terms of classes, I’d say if you're going to invest in them, a well-structured, affordable course from places like Udemy or Pluralsight might give you more value for your money. They offer structured paths that are more flexible than community college but still provide that sense of accountability.",

To be fair, I've never applied to a job that was for, say, a React developer.\n\nThe ones I've been that did coding were on paper or on a whiteboard. I believe the reason they did this was because using a computer with a specific IDE would favor someone that used that IDE or someone that uses an IDE over someone that just uses Notepad++ to code that only does syntax highlighting.\n\nIt would be unfair to have interview someone where Netbeans was the IDE (since it's not that popular) or maybe IntelliJ (popular, but it costs money so some companies won't pay for it). And nowadays, there's AIs helping out.\n\nIt is a mistake to think great coders code everything from scratch. If you use, say, Flutter, you're already not coding \"from scratch\". Someone built a web framework so you wouldn't have to code things from scratch. Also, frameworks have a lot of moving parts, so it's hard to recall it all.\n\nThis is why you see leetcode problems because they require minimal knowledge of libraries and frameworks and mostly rely on DSA knowledge.\n\nIt will depend on the interview. When I had one and asked if I could just use pseudocode, they kind of implied no. The problem with pseudocode is you could hand-wave many parts away saying surely there's an API to do X (when there isn't) and you avoid doing the real thinking.",

It just means that you just discovered one more way to do the same stuff.\n\nBe proud to say \"I don't know\". Don't try to hide it. If you get into a place where people shame you for that phrase - they are stupid and cowards. Not knowing something is just a first step into knowing it. Without this step - you will never learn anything.\n\nI worked at some companies where the code base is so terrible that even with my bad experience I was shocked by its quality. And the people there were so proud of themselves.\n\nAfter that I started to realize that perfect code exists only in examples. If the project is live and constantly changing - the chances that it will become a monster are almost 99%.\n\nIt doesn't mean that you should not care about your code.

I’m not saying that’s fair, it’s just how it is. But, over time the degree matters less than the experience so if there are ways you can get yourself into the tech field even if it isn’t programming, that will get you started. Also note (and you can read this in the news) programmers are a bit at risk these days with AI. So it would be good to find a space in the AI world with programming. There will be more open doors this way, at least for the short term.",

Learn how to use the terminal. Learn everything you can about installing and maintaining a Linux system. RHCSA is good, but not needed. Learn Docker and Kubernetes. Learn a cloud service like AWS or Azure. \n\nMost importantly, always be ready to learn. \n\nI did all that and applied to a DevOps/Sys Admin role. The company I applied to also needed intern product developer role. I volunteered for that. Did a 6 month internship. Pretty weird to be an intern as a 34 year old, but I’d like to think I killed it there. They made me a permanent employee on June 1st and I’m loving it. \n\nI suppose being a bit older than a regular intern motivated me to put my best foot forward.

Being good at this will make you successful in all parts of SWE.\n\nIf you want a decent-paying job as a software developer, here is your roadmap:\n\n1. Go to school for a CS degree\n2. Get an internship during your studies\n3. Between school, work, etc, practice building large, complex, full-stack projects to showcase on your resume\n4. By the time you graduate, you will probably spend several months to a year competing for entry-level jobs\n\nJumping in to SWE expecting your life to quickly improve is a mistake.

Nursing is absolutely recession proof. People always get sick, and there's a massive shortage of nurses. Plus at 48, you'd have a solid 20+ year career ahead of you.\n\nBut since you asked about tech longevity... AI/ML, cybersecurity, and mobile development aren't going anywhere. Web development is evolving but still fundamental. The thing is, tech moves fast and you gotta keep learning constantly. At Metana we see people in their 40s and 50s successfully transition into development, but it takes real commitment to stay current.\n\nHere's what I'd consider in your shoes. What actually interests you more? Do you want to help people directly through healthcare, or do you get excited about building things digitally? Both can be financially rewarding but they're completely different day to day experiences.\n\nAlso, have you thought about healthcare tech? There's tons of opportunity there, especially for people who understand both sides. But honestly, if you're leaning toward nursing for the stability and recession-proofing, that's totally valid reasoning.\n\nThe rental income gives you flexibility to take either path without desperation, which is huge. Most people don't have that luxury when making career pivots.",

There is no \"if this then that then that\" that works all the time everywhere. Each program is different.\n\nAIs just calculate a statistical probabilistic model of what could potentially follow. They don't have any understanding of programming at all.\n\nIf you want to be a good programmer, you have to learn programming - without AI first.

If it's about \"need,\" the answer is \"not much,\" because there's such a wide range of specializations needing different things. Moreover, you're right that nowadays it's very easy to look up things, but it's a matter of proficiency that eventually you should be looking up less things.\n\n\nFor example, the first time I ever got a NullPointerException I remember it was a really difficult bug, I didn't know what pointers *or* null were, and I had to frontload learning all that. Once you've seen them enough though, you just know what it is, how it happens, and how to debug it, and usually (for NPEs caught early) it's a ~2 minute ordeal. I see stories online about people spending hours debugging missing semicolons: once you reach a certain level of familiarity with syntax, that just stops being an issue.\n\n\nAs you start to get more proficient, people generally expect you to \"just know\" more. Seniors *are* very adept at learning new things in tech, and very good at finding information to fill their gaps. But they also know a lot, and can more or less jump into a moderate-complexity codebase and get to work without much ramp-up. It's not that they \"need\" to memorize the information, but that they need a certain critical mass of experience to be able to do their job effectively. (Try asking foreign language learners about the difference between being able to look up a grammar table vs having the table memorized vs being able to speak correctly.) This is all ignoring the logistics of how one even knows what to google for unclear issues.\n\n\nThis especially applies with specialization: I wouldn't expect most programmers to know low-level details of memory layout, paging, CPU caching, etc, but since I write database internals, it's sort of critical to being able to do my job. OTOH I've met other devs at the same company that don't know the difference between RAM and disk, and they're doing fine in their expertise: it's just not a thing that's very relevant if you're working in some areas.\n\n\nSo, overall, I think the answer is \"learn *some* things well.\" You see people often reference T-shaped skillsets, where there's a large set of shallow skills (the top of the T) and a few deep ones (the vertical line). Syntax / basics are pretty much must-have, as well as some library/framework experience. But beyond that, be willing to dive into the details of tools you work with, practice learning as a skill, and start building that internal library. Looking things up on the job is fine, but learn from those resources, don't just drop them and move on as soon as you've found an answer.",

This is a process.\n\nWriting the code itself (ignoring AI writing the code for you or just vibe coding) is a bit of that process and a bit of actual knowledge of the methods, properties and syntax required. This just comes with time. At first you will be constantly looking things up, but eventually it will start to sink in. Im personally glad I learned most of what I know before AI because now it is hard to do anything without it since it is just so much faster to get a quick answer.

You still have to actually learn how to program and you should learn it on SOMETHING, once you understand the concepts and get a flow for making things it becomes easier to pick up another language. \n\nI wouldn't leave yourself not understanding async for example, it is used almost everywhere, even if you aren't writing it, it will be built into the libraries you are using. The best way to learn is to do, so pick a language and try to write something with a thread or two just to see how it is done and run the thought exercise for managing the sync and flow of everything. \n\nI think the advice is true, when you get your job you will be working in the tech stack the company has and most of the difficulty will be figuring out the companies code base, so while you might be an expert in one language they may be using another. \n\nHowever, this does not mean that it doesn't make your life easier to know one language and just learn the ins and outs of the other language vs trying to figure out say async concepts while figuring out he language, it is much better to pick up a language and read what kind of async stuff is in the language while understanding the concepts and challenges ahead of time.  It is much better to help you evaluate the code base as well if you have a good understanding of what 'good' can look like. \n\nAnother interpretation of it might really be that you can't learn everything a computer can do now a days, it is essentially infinite as it continuously expands day bay day. But again, do not take this as don't bother mastering what you are working on, or, i don't get this topic and am free to  moving on.  If you move on make it for a good reason, you won't ever use it perhaps or hate it so much you would refuse a job working with it etc.",

You already understand user problems and how systems break, which is half the battle.\n\nBetween JavaScript and C#, honestly both are solid choices but I'd lean toward JavaScript for someone in your position becuase JavaScript is everywhere. Frontend, backend (Node.js), mobile apps, even desktop apps. More versatility means more job opportunities. The learning curve can be a bit weird at first but once it clicks, you're golden. C# is great too, especially if you're thinking enterprise development or want something more structured. Microsoft ecosystem is huge and pays well.\n\nAt Metana we see a lot of career changers and the ones who succeed fastest are usually those with some kind of customer facing or problem solving background. They just \"get\" what users need in a way that pure CS grads sometimes dont.\n\nMy advice? Pick JavaScript, build a few projects that solve real problems you've seen in help desk work, and apply for roles that value that crossover like developer advocate positions, technical support engineering, or even full stack roles at smaller companies.\n\nEither way you choose though, you're already ahead of most beginners because you understand the business side of tech.

I would say Python is a very great one to start - it's syntax is quite readable, it's easier to use than many other languages, and yet it will certainly get you into the \"flow\" with how to think about how to solve programming type problems.\n\nI would 100% recommend coding along to a YouTube channel, namely BroCode (his videos and teaching style are amazing). There are also some great sites like CodeCademy that have guided practice / learning sessions - these would probably be more than enough to teach you the fundamental terms you'll want to familiiarize yourself with.\n\nMore than anything, it is \\*totally\\* normal to feel lost. Just remember that you do not need to understand all of a certain language or anything (nobody does!), and that you can go quite far with the fundamental building blocks of most programming (like variables, functions, loops, and conditionals). Although there tends to be \"better\" ways to do things and \"worse\" ways to do things, there are TONS of solutions to the same problem in programming, perhaps more so than many other fields.\n\n  \nJust to clarify - GitHub is basically a platform for storing and sharing code projects, especially when multiple people are working together. It's more of a tool for managing and collaborating on code rather than a place to learn programming itself. That's probably why you felt so lost there!\n\nIn any case, try to have fun as you learn!",

If you make a change where you later find out something broke, you can always revert back to the commit where you know everything worked.\n\nOf course there is still lots of room for improvement here with proper branching strategies. But to start off, this is better than nothing.\n\n**Tests:**\n\nIn your case, I would really suggest writing integration or end to end tests. Ignore unit tests completely.\n\nAll you want to know is that broadly speaking, your feature set works as intended. Caring about every single unit of code is not where you're at.\n\n[Test bahavior, not implementation details](https://codeling.dev/blog/testing-behavior-or-implementation/) which will tell you immediately if any of your features break and makes refactoring code much less risky and certainly less of a pain in the a$$.\n\n**Where to start:**\n\nSince you're really concerned about existing working features breaking when you change something, I would really suggest writing a few tests for the most important features.\n\nMaybe start working in version control when you feel you're up to it,...but at least start with a few end to end or integration tests which focus on behavior. It's easier than you think,....and actually quite fun,...and makes you feel safe making changes or new features.",

But being *good* meaning writing clean, scalable, professional code that actually works in real applications.

In just a couple months, you can:\n\n• Learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  \n• Understand how to structure and style a webpage  \n• Add interactivity with JavaScript  \n• Build simple websites, landing pages, and portfolios  \n• Clone real websites like blogs or product pages to sharpen your skills\n\nThat gives you momentum, and it’s enough to get noticed. But the real growth happens after those first few months. Buuuuuut, that’s also when things start to feel much harder, and where most people drop off. They get stuck and lose motivation, or don’t know what to learn next.\n\nIf you’re serious about learning web development and actually becoming a real developer, my community on Skool can guide you every step of the way. You’ll get support, answers when you’re stuck, and a clear path to follow without wasting time guessing.\n\nYou can check it out here: [Coding With Joseph Community](https://www.skool.com/cwj/about)",

That's actually not old at all in tech, and honestly some of the sharpest people I know didn't really hit their stride until their 40s or later.\n\nYour IT support background is actually gold. Most college grads and junior devs have zero real world troubleshooting experience, but you've got 4 years of it. That's huge when things break in production.\n\nAbout the ADHD thing, look, it can be challenging but it can also be a superpower once you find your groove. The hyperfocus aspect is incredible for debugging or diving deep into problems that would frustrate other people.\n\nRegarding web dev vs cloud/cyber? honestly with your AZ-900 already done, you've got momentum there. Don't underestimate that achievement. The fact that you passed shows you can learn new tech. \n\nAt Metana we've had plenty of career changers in their 40s and 50s. What I notice is they often outperform younger students because they have better work discipline and actually know what they want from their career.\n\nMy take? Pick one path and commit for 6 months. Based on what you've shared, cloud seems like the natural next step. Go for AZ-104 next, build some projects, document everything you do. The networking and scripting stuff will come as you practice.\n\nYou're not behind. You're just getting started on the next chapter :)",

I remember feeling exactly like this when I was starting out and honestly, even now running Metana and helping train developers, I still see this pattern with almost every single student who transitions into their first dev role.\n\nHere's the thing that might help reframe this. You upgraded Node containers, used new JS features, AND you sought help when you hit a roadblock. That's actually really solid problem-solving. Yeah, you could have done the cloud builder upgrade yourself, but how were you supposed to know that without... well, being told exactly what happened?\n\nYour tech lead isn't frustrated with you, they're teaching you. There's a huge difference. If they thought you were doing poorly, trust me, you'd know it. The fact that they're giving you your own features to plan means they see potential.\n\nAt Metana, I always tell our bootcamp grads that the first 6-12 months are basically extended learning with a paycheck. You're not supposed to know everything yet. The goal is to learn fast and not make the same mistake twice.\n\nOne thing that really helped me early on was keeping a \"learning log\". Just a simple doc where I'd write down these exact situations. What I did, what I learned, how I'd handle it next time. Looking back at it after a few months was eye-opening because I could see how much I'd actually grown.\n\nAlso, 5 months in and you're already handling complex features and supporting QA? That's actually ahead of the curve. Most devs I know were still figuring out the codebase at that point.\n\nThe imposter syndrome is real but it gets better as you build up more of these learning experiences. Just don't let it paralyze you from taking on those new features they want you to plan.",

Making mods is actually a solid intro to programming, and Java is a widely used language, even in jobs.\n\nDon’t worry about learning “the perfect language” right now. Start with Java through Minecraft modding, and as you get comfortable, you can branch into others like Python or JavaScript. You *can* learn multiple languages over time, but focus on one first.\n\nCheck out some beginner-friendly Java tutorials or modding guides, and try building small things.",

Gaming is a huge industry and there are loads of jobs in it so you shouldn't think of making mods for Minecraft as something that diverts from becoming a programmer in the future. In fact I'd argue that it is a really good place to start because you are interested in the game, so you will be very invested in learning. \n\nI learned HTML at around your age because I wanted to make fan sites for bands I was into.

If you’re just starting out, I’d recommend following his YouTube playlists in the order he’s arranged them - he usually builds up from basics to advanced topics, so it’s a good flow for learning concepts step by step.\n\nOnce you’re comfortable with the basics, you can use his TUF website to focus on specific topics or practice questions. The site is great for targeted revision and for brushing up on theory before tackling coding problems. Some people like to watch the theory video for a topic, then immediately try related questions from the site—that’s a solid approach too.\n\nSo, in short:  \n- If you want a structured path, follow the YouTube playlist order\n- If you want to focus on certain topics or practice, use the TUF website to pick and choose. Good luck!",

More practically: imagine that these questions aren't created in code as part of an exercise/test but are simply read from a database. and another tool is used to insert the questions into the database. So as a programmer you have no idea how many questions there are or how to name them.\n\nIt makes a lot more sense to simply throw them into a list (the list of questions). \n\nIn your case because you run into exercises and example code, often people want to show you things you'll encounter in later life but run into the problem that doing the setup for these sorts of systems would distract you from the thing they are trying to teach. So they compromise.\n\nPersonally I would find it better to use a function that returns the questions (in your case). the function will return a list of questions and you can add in comments / naming of the function that it represents a lookup from file or database. that way you can practice working with abstractions / accepting data comes from another location (without needing to know exactly how it is put together)",

Don't, like many of the haters, neglect the message in chapter one where the author states something like \"This is a book written like there's only one way, but there are other views and here are some of them.\" That is, after chapter 1 they write as if what they say is dogma, it *is* true and there are no alternatives. Which is a fine way to write because writing the 100 variations and counterpoints would result in a tome, and you'd be better served by reading what others believe than whatever Bob & Co. interpreted of what others believe.",

Many of the types of people who write textbooks are really passionate about teaching, and have put in a lot of work to put their own spin on these concepts. There's a lot of recs online that you can try reviewing.\n\nI personally really liked making my own versions of others' abstractions. E.g. at some point I wrote a program (mini search engine) that used my own version of the \\`List\\` interface with my own implementations of \\`LinkedList\\` and \\`ArrayList\\`.

I almost never set out with an idea how how many or what types of modules will need, I just come to points in the process where I'm like, damn that's ugly, or I realize that I'm re-using stuff, or this function is huge, let's throw it in a new file.\n\nOf course if you find yourself creating something where it's extremely obvious that you'll be using it all over, then sure, go ahead and proactively write it as a module from the get go and build it up as you go.",

Just endless pain and headaches and frustration. But until you experience some of that pain, none of the strategies to solve it really make that much sense. And when you're starting out working on smaller projects, often a lot of code organization is kind of optional anyways because you're not dealing with enough complexity for it to really matter.\n\nSo, like, sure, read about it. Think about it. But understand that what will make it click is getting your hands dirty in the guts of big, complex codebases.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that, although there are principles that can be applied, really needs experience and developing some *intuition* for the problem in order to be able to do well at it.

A function is a set of code that performs a specific task, and can be reused repeatedly. \n\nFor example, thinking of a simple calculator application that we want to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. When we think about specific tasks that can be made into functions, it sounds like we will need a function for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, as those are all specific tasks that we want to perform repeatedly. \n\nOf course, identifying functions gets more complicated for larger projects, but you don't need to know all the functions you could possibly need ahead of time. Modularization isn't something that happens completely up-front before you program anything, it's something that you will do throughout the programming process. For me what works is outlining functions I know I need at the beginning, then starting to write my program and looking out for sections of code that are reused multiple times. When I realize it is something that is going to be reused, I move it to a function. \n\nBasically, keep an eye out for things that your program will be doing a lot of. Any time you are seeing the same logic repeated, or have something that performs a specific task, those are good things to consider putting into functions. \n\nDon't worry if you can't identify everything in advance or feel like it's a struggle at first. That's part of the learning process and I promise, it gets easier the more you do it!",

In my opinion it’s similar in this way to object oriented design. I use a limited version of both in my personal projects and when I’m working on small teams.\n\nFor modularizing, you generally start with one file, and then at some point you break it into multiple files just as a basic organizing step. And yes you often make classes to encapsulate natural units, like a matrix class, a networking class, a class for the application overall.\n\nBut once you start going crazy with lots and lots of classes, and complex class hierarchies, you make it harder to make those fundamental pivots.\n\nAs a simple concrete example, an oop book might tell you a personnel management app should have an Employee class and from that derive classes for various types of employees, probably using intermediate classes, like a Manager class, from which you derive UnitManager and SeniorExec, all with their own classes. This might work out well in certain cases, if you’re lucky. But in my experience, just make the one Employee class and give it a “type” member. See how far that gets you before making a tree of classes, each probably in their own code file. And the same idea goes for overall modularization.\n\nI have a saying: Don’t divide and conquer yourself.",

We don't know what is going to change, but we know that change is inevitable. Maybe an API you depend on gets a breaking change, maybe you want to drastically change the way you display stuff to users, maybe you discover a major security flaw with how you're handling data etc etc...\n\nThe way we prepare for that is not by thinking about every possible scenario and making preparations, but instead by building systems that are flexible to change. One way you could achieve that is by following the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID).\n\n1. Limit your modules to only one responsibility. ([example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON))\n2. Write your modules to be open to extension, but closed to modification. ([example](https://alexnault.dev/open-closed-principle-in-functional-typescript))\n3. Any substitute modules you write should not break the program. ([example: a square data object is not a valid substitute for a rectangle data object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle#Violation))\n4. Keep code decoupled from other code it does not need. The math module does not need to know about drawing boxes on the DOM.\n5. Depend on interfaces rather than specific implementations.

Stop trying to memorize syntax. Seriouslyy. Even experienced devs look stuff up constantly.

Use it to check balanced parentheses, then use it for undo functionality etcc.

All developers forget the little bits from time to time, and it sucks because the code won't run without them, but it's just how it works. Our brains are not computers, so speaking computer languages, especially like Java, doesn't come naturally. When you were learning English, you didn't say everything correctly all the time either, and you still don't, but obviously you know English, and you can communicate your point well enough that everyone here, native English speaker or not, understands you. It's the same for Java, or any other coding language. You'll always be looking up this syntax or that function. Eventually, the things you're learning now will become second nature when you've used them in 50 different programs or functions. But by then, you'll be looking up other things you just can't remember the exact way to do. Don't stress about this part.\n\nBut if, even after looking it up and getting the code to compile and do what you want it to do, you're not proud of yourself, then you might want to consider whether this is the right career for you. Because honestly, I will spend 60+ hours on a bug sometimes, and I have literally thrown a party (a happy hour with coworkers) when I got to a different error message I hadn't seen before.

If you don't want to party when the code works right (or at least more right), then you are either taking it all too seriously, or you might not have the right temperament for Software Engineering.\n\nGood luck!!",

        "body": "There are people who like the unknown and there are people who like the known. Those who like the known are those who prefer to live in a town where they are close to relatives and friends. The idea of going some place new where you have to make new friends is scary. Others will hop on a plane and decide to wander the Earth with no particular plan except to explore. They believe they will manage somehow. One is driven more by fear, and the other is driven by lack of fear.\n\nAnyway, it sounds like you want reassurances to make sure you know every step of the way where others would just jump in and do. You're probably concerned \"what if I get stuck and don't know what to do next\". You want someone to help you out. People may help, and that's great, but realizing that, ultimately, you have to look out for yourself is an important life skill. I myself fall into the category of wanting to know how I will do things ahead of time.\n\nBut, let's just go through some of your questions.\n\n**What should be my ideal roadmap or study plan to cover CS50 efficiently in this time frame?**\n\nTry not to worry about the time frame. The course is set up for ten weeks, but this is a Harvard course and as a college course, it's pretty aggressive to finish so quickly. I would budget twice the time, maybe twenty weeks which is about 5 months, but take all the time you need. You don't have to race to the answer. You may feel like you have to be efficient, but expect to be slow, and don't pressure yourself to move faster because you'll likely skip information you need by trying to \"keep up\".\n\n**How many hours should I ideally dedicate each day, considering I want to complete as much as possible before July ends?**\n\nYou've only given yourself 5 weeks. You are unlikely to finish unless you are either smart or cheat (you may think using ChatGPT is not cheating, but it is). The class already takes ten weeks for Harvard students, and you want to do it in half the time. \n\nSpending lots of hours, esp. on academic topics, is not always productive. There's this joke that goes \"if it takes 9 months for a woman to have a baby, then it should take 9 women 1 month each to have a baby\" which means that you can't speed up certain things. I mean, if you can spend that time and not go brain dead, then good for you. Give it a try. But most people find it hard to focus for more than about 3 hours a day. If you try for more, you'll need a break, and you'll have to be making some progress during that time.\n\nYou might get through the C coding part if you happen to be quick (so 5 weeks).\n\n**How does submission of problem sets and projects work?**\n\nI think you need to read this and figure it out. It is a bit elaborate involving using Github and setting that up. Harvard doesn't want to be in business of managing user accounts. There are instructions on how to do this. I would say, outside of the actual programming itself, it's this part that's kind of annoying. You just have to follow the steps carefully, that's all. I would probably suggest using their version of Visual Studio Code (assuming they still use it).\n\n**Are there any specific tools or software I need to install beforehand?**\n\nYou'll be instructed how to do this. This is the kind of question that suggest apprehension on your part. Read it, dig in, and figure it out. It's a useful skill to be able to work through problems.\n\n**Any extra advice, personal experiences, or tips you’d like to share would be greatly appreciated!**\n\nThe problem sets (which are the programming assignments) are challenging. I've taught intro programming and I would likely not give that level of difficulty to a class. In particular, CS50x uses more math than the projects I used to assign. Also, some projects are considered notoriously challenging. One is called Tideman. Usually, they have an easier version of the project and a harder one. You might opt to do the easier one.\n\nOne reason Tideman is challenging is the length of the description of what to do. Beyond that, it's hard to visualize the arrays to place the data. If C were object-oriented, it might be easier to understand (though still not easy).\n\nExpect it to be challenging. Don't worry if you don't complete the course in a month. You're expecting a lot, maybe too much. Any progress would be considered good. Try not to be disappointed if you only get through, say, 3 weeks of the course in the time allotted. You're setting yourself up to be disappointed.\n\nAnyway, good luck. Hope you get done as much as you plan, but even if you don't you took some initiative which is a positive attitude.",

As a almost beginner you are not going to cover CS50 in a month and complete all of the problem sets.\n\n\nThe CS50 website is well-designed, provides an outlay of the curriculum, and has additional resources which I would advise you to utilise.\n\n\nDon't go in with the aim to get everything done in x amount of time. Focus on making sure that what you cover in x time, you fully understand and can demonstrably use (the problem sets will test this).\n\n\nI would take notes through using comments in your code. When you come back some time later to your code, comments really get you up to speed quickly. \n\n\nI would advise a good ol' fashioned notepad and pencil to help you with the problem sets. It really helps when you design potential solutions that you can draw / write out steps in psuedocode.\n\n\nTL;DR as another poster said, just do!",

Being too careless sucks, being too careful sucks. Really good advice, specially because it might pass as \"obvious\" for some people.\n\nOther than that, a good guiding comment on how to tackle CS50. I did most of the course's problems (Didn't make the final one, so no certificate to show) and even though I already had some experience with C(just as a student, I don't have any professional experience), Tideman gave me a few hours of thinking and stressing over. The course is indeed challenging and it brushes over some of topics that will require more studying if you want a better understanding, such as data structures and algorithms, how memory works and so on.\n\nNot OP, but thank you for the comment and willingness to share your experience in depth.",

When you call `super().__init__(side, side)`, it’s essentially telling Python to look up the inheritance chain and call the `__init__` method of the parent class (which in this case is `Rectangle`). This allows the `Square` class to inherit and use the initialization logic of the `Rectangle` class without explicitly referencing `Rectangle` by name. When `super().__init__(side, side)` is called, it sets the `height` and `width` attributes of the `Square` instance (which is `s`), because `super()` is calling `Rectangle.__init__` internally and passing the values to it.\n\nNow, in the second example, `Rectangle.__init__(self, side, side)` does something similar but directly. You’re calling the `__init__` method of the `Rectangle` class explicitly. Here, `Rectangle.__init__` sets the `height` and `width` attributes on the `Square` instance (`s`) in the same way, but this time, you’re directly referencing the parent class.\n\nIn both cases, the key point is that calling `__init__` on a class (whether via `super()` or directly) will set up the attributes of the instance. When you do `Rectangle.__init__(self, side, side)`, it sets `self.height` and `self.width` on the `Square` instance, just as if the `Square` class was directly calling `Rectangle`'s `__init__` method.\n\nThe reason this works, even though `Rectangle` is a class, is because `Rectangle.__init__` is a method that belongs to the class and can be called just like any other method. The instance (`self` in `Square`) is passed along, so it has access to the attributes defined within the method.",

When any method is called on them, they search the [method-resolution-order (MRO)](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method-resolution-order) for this combination, and call that instead.\nThe actual call signature of `super`:\n\n```\nsuper(type, object_or_type)\n```\n\nTakes these 2 arguments. Usually, `type` is a class, `object_or_type` is an instance of that class. When called without argument but directly followed by a method call, these arguments default to the enclosing class and the calling instance.\n\nTherefore, let's break down what happens in the case you described:\n\n> super is a class therefore super().__init__(side, side) should create instance of the class super\n\n1. `super()` returns a proxy object, bound to the type `<class Square>` and the current instance of that class\n2. `.__init__` tells the proxy object: \"Search the MRO for this instance of this class 'upwards' for a method called `__init__`\"\n3. The search determines that the method to call is `Rectangle.__init__`\n4. `(side, side)` now calls `Rectangle.__init__` with `side` as the value for both arguments",

It also signals clearly what each method is doing, which is autodocumenting. \n\nin the second case you have to look a little closer. And while it can be convenient to use \"field\" as a variable that means people could call it like:\n\n    GetEntry(someVariable, someValue);\n\nleaving you with no idea what is going on. (or whether someVariable actually exists). now imagine this call is being done in code outside of your reach. (a client library for instance). you wouldn't know what variables they are using. so if you ever change the database you won't have an automatic warning that the field they are selecting on exists. Except at runtime which is not ideal. \n\nIf you make the same changes in the first example, (remove a findBy..... because the field is no longer offered), the client will get a compilation error when a developer updates to the latest version of your library. which they will be much happier about than an error in the rare situation a user sorts a table by pressing a UI element the developers never touch.\n\nI know what I write is slightly charged / exaggerated but I tried to sketch the use cases where you would know the difference.\n\nI think you are falling into a beginner trap where more code looks inefficient. And creating a godly one-liner that handles everything / runs the whole program looks good. But more verbose self-documenting code generally is code that will have less bugs later on. because you won't be the only programmer working on your code. You may not even be at the employer when someone tries to work on a function / replaces something. \n\nfor instance in your case: it is easy to replace findById with findByIdOrSecondaryId  because it'll be clear where you use it and you'll get a compiler error if you forget one since the original doesn't exist. But it is entirely possible you overlook GetObject( \"id\") (possibly because of whitespace differences and such.\n\nThink about cleanness of code in the sense that it should be straightforward to read. Don't shy away from extra functions. However what you can do is have findByName and findByEmail and findById all internally call GetEntry(string field, string value) if you wish. (to share error handling/recovery/etc). that way you present stable methods to the outside world and you can have more generic reusable functions for internal use.\n\nnone of this is absolute truth of course, just advice",

Some aspects of game programming are much harder than the usual fields of programming.\n\nI would say it's only good if they're already interested in programming and it focuses on the hard parts of game programming.\n\nIf the course focuses on how to make a game, then they'll learn how to make a game, not programming. Almost no game design courses teach any amount of programming.\n\nIf it's writing their own game engine or something, then it teaches a lot more.\n\nAlso you can't say \"learn to program\" and \"JavaScript\" with a straight face. It's sad to see the focus entirely on WebDev. What is the goal: do you want them to learn programming or WebDev? GameDev is not a good way to learn WebDev.\n\nIf you look at the CS50 course, you can see the order they go in:  \n[https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/)\n\nThey actually begin by having people make a game. But they basically learn no programming from it because it's using Scratch. I actually think that week could have been replaced with something better. Notice how they go all the way through an intro course and through Data Structures before they even start WebDev.\n\nI spent many years making games on Atari XE and graphing calculators. I went to a community college after that and learned basic programming. But a single Data Structures course was more impactful on my ability to program than all those years of experience combined.\n\nAlso when I tutored math, people always said the same thing. They hated math until they learned it properly, then they loved it. They were so happy doing it. Teachers focus too much on making things \"fun\" instead of making things understandable. The fun comes naturally when they're learning.",

        "body": "I have tried making some introductory programming curricula based on making games, as well as an advanced DSA course - not as \"game design courses\", but simply using games as the applications that the students had to build.\n\nI still think it is an excellent idea, and it works really well, especially because when writing a game, you naturally run the code over and over, and it is never exactly the same, so you constantly discover new issues, more things to learn. Whereas if you build a program to display a list of items from a database, the moment you got a list, you are done, and leave that part of the code. Also, when you make a game you feel like you've built something - and you are proud to show it to others, and let them play it. Whereas when you've made a form for entry into a database, well ... :)\n\nAnd I believe that you can learn any programming topic from writing games - there's almost no single algorithm, pattern or data structure that doesn't fit into some game or other.\n\nHowever, I've had some issues - mostly with students and especially other teachers not understanding what they actually learned, so I'll give you some of them as \"warnings\" - not warnings against doing it, but warnings about how it might be received.\n\n* Students have a really hard time transferring skills between writing different kinds of software - when they learned how to write games, they didn't understand how it could be used in database-applications, when they learned frontend coding, they didnt' understand how it could be used in backend, then they learned terminal-applications they didn't understand how it could be applied to web-applications, and so on. It is important to add other kinds of applications using the same patterns as they learned in the games - so they don't think that it is a \"games course\", but see how learning to code with games, is just learning to code.\n* Students are extremely scared of math - not just matrix-calculations, or trigonometry, but something as simple as ratios, converting a number between 0 and 1 to a number between 50 and 300 is almost impossible for them to grasp. And in games there's a lot of math. Don't be discouraged by it, just be prepared to spend A LOT of time explaining even the simplest calculations.\n* Some students actively dislike having to create or even obtain graphics and other assets. But on the other hand they don't like just being given assets and \"forced\" to use them - expect to spend quite a bit of time explaining how to prepare those as well :)\n* As games get a bit more complex, there is a lot of prep-work in building the level or setting up the code for input. I recommend re-using code throughout the course, and copying in earlier \"blocks\" from some games to re-use later, so the students don't feel like they spend all their time typing in \"platform code\".\n* A lot of programming students nowadays actually don't know that many \"simple\" games, so it might be necessary with a bit of games history as well, to teach them about top-down, platforms, scrollers, shooters, and so on. I was surprised at how few of my references my students actually recognized - even when it got to board games!\n\nBut otherwise, I think that it is a really, really good idea - and don't listen to the \"haters\" talking about how games programming and JavaScript isn't \"real\" programming! Every kind of programming is programming, and if something can inspire students to build more on their own, it is even better!",

        "body": ">I haven't really built anything worth noting\n\nNobody's first projects are anything worth noting! You're still in the learning stage. That's fine - we all start at the same place.\n\n>I made a calculator that you can use your terminal but that's pretty much it.\n\nHow does it work? Can I type in 5 \\* 6 + (3 - 4) / 8, and it will give me the right answer, or is it more restricted than that? Can it handle fractions? Can it handle exponentiation? Factorials? Basic polynomial algebra? If I give it an unusual expression like 3 - (-(-2)), does it handle it as expected? If I give it a syntactically illegal expression like \"5 + \\* 5\", or a mathematically illegal expression like \"3 / 0\", does it handle it gracefully without crashing?\n\nThere's a **lot** that goes into building a calculator, and this kind of thing might be an interesting project.  If you're not interested in calculators, don't think of it as a calculator: think of it as \"teaching the computer to understand commands\". This is a whole field in its own right - tokenising, lexing, parsing, building syntax trees, Backus-Naur, and all that - and this is a (small but significant) step towards building something like a compiler. (As a side benefit, it will also make you better at understanding and reading certain kinds of documentation.)\n\nAlso: when you do this, you'll probably want to reuse your old calculator code, but you might find that extending your code to accept these new features is more trouble than it's worth, and you have to rewrite it from scratch. Don't be afraid of doing this, even multiple times if you have to - in fact, I think it's a really good thing in the learning stage. Implementing individual features is one thing, but learning how to structure large projects in a clean and modular way - so that you can swap out features, upgrade them, rewrite them without changing all the rest of your code - is a skill in its own right.\n\n>I saw a guy build a snake game that was cool.\n\nWhy not try building that yourself? Or Pac-Man, or Tetris. It can be in the terminal if you want - just redraw the board as a grid of characters every second - it'll look ugly, but that's fine.\n\nThat said, if you're feeling up to something a bit more of a challenge, then why not learn to use a library like [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)? That's a simple way of getting graphics onto the screen. Fair warning: once you start using external libraries, the difficulty **does** spike a little, because you're suddenly having to learn a whole new feature set that you know nothing about, with all of the syntactic difficulties that come along with it. In practice, what that means is you will spend a lot of time learning how to read documentation efficiently, which is also a crucial skill for a programmer.\n\n>I don't exactly know the full capabilities of c++ so I'm open to suggestions.\n\nLiterally anything a computer can do, you can do it in C++. Most operating systems are written in C, which you can think of as a very bare-bones version of C++. Most modern programming languages have compilers / interpreters written in C/C++. Most browsers and web servers are written in C/C++. \n\nThe main barrier here is not the capability of C++: it's the fact that even very \"simple\" software can be tens of thousands of lines of code, and you need to work towards that. So don't be afraid to rewrite things that people have already written before: they will be very valuable learning tools.",

Yes, the way your program is currently implemented may need only one instance of a Configuration. But software changes over time and I've seen it plenty of times that something was introduced as a singleton when only one instance of the thing was required and later it turned out that (under certain conditions) you need multiples of that thing. Something as simple as a test that runs the code that depends on the singleton twice can become impossible to implement properly. And refactoring a singleton away can be a lot of work.\n\nAnother general issues with singletons is that you can access them from anywhere (as there often is a global Singleton::GetInstance() function or similar). This means that (as opposed to using dependency injection) it is hard to tell what code depends on the existence of that singleton, making it hard to reason about the code. And then there are other issues like initialization/deinitialization and dependencies between multiple singletons, etc. That's the reason why the singleton pattern is considered an anti-pattern.\n\nThat being said there are common cases where I see singletons used frequently (e.g. for a clock or a logger object) where it can be justified but even for those I've seen it cause problems that they are implemented as singletons.\n\nFor your specific case, I would not implement a Configuration as a singleton. The example you provide (multiple instances of calculations using their own copy of a Configuration object) is reason enough to not make it a singleton.",

Depends on the login it can get harder or just *EZ* as fuck.  \nThen you can do it with an ***async***/***await*** function with a ***Promise.All***.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n`const page = await browser.newPage();`\n\n`await page.goto('https://yourwebtoscrap.com/login', { waitUntil: '`networkidle2' `});`\n\n`await page.type('#username', 'yourUsername');`\n\n`await page.type('#password', 'yourPassword');`\n\n`await Promise.all([`\n\n`page.click('#loginButton') ...)]`\n\n1- First problem -> If there is a ***Captcha*** \\-> You can solve with AntiCaptcha or other techs.  \n2- If you want to fully \"*automate*\" it, you can use a ***CRON***, with this you can schedule when to do something. With ***NODEJS*** you can use **node-cron**, and it looks like this:\n\n`cron.schedule('0 8 * * *', () => {`\n\n`console.log('Running scraping task at 8:00 AM every day');`\n\nBy the way, if you are using *Ubuntu*, you can check *Crontab* and take a look at it, cos it's pretty similar. Is the way *Ubuntu* schedule tasks for the *OS* (and you can schedule some scripts in Ubuntu's crontab, I did one for example to always commit something to Github once a day).\n\nIt's been a long time since I \"scrap\" a website, but I still think I can give it a try again. If you need some examples with *Node*, just tell me and I'll link the ones on my *Github*.\n\nHope it helps.",

For example, I have this issue where sometimes I want to send a link to someone or use it in a document but it's a little bit too long and ugly for my liking, but I'm also too lazy to open a new tab to bitly or tinyurl just to shorten and copy the link. So, a good solution would be a chrome extension that grabs the current tab's link that you want to send to someone and it automatically shortens it using the bitly API or however you want and you can save it or copy it or create a QR code with it, whatever. You can create this project with the technologies you have, it is very easy.\n\nSolving your own problems with code is one of the most rewarding and motivating things you can do.",

However, to get Windows to load an unsigned driver, you have to use the boot menu to disable driver signature enforcement.\n\nThe driver will expose an API (accessed through IOCTL calls) that will allow a user mode program to pass it a process ID.  You will then write a user mode program that will find or get the process ID of the target application and pass it up to the driver.\n\nThe driver can then use functions like MmProbeAndLockPages, and MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache to build MDLs for the virtual memory regions that you are interested in in the target application, lock them into physical RAM, then map them back down into the virtual address space of your user mode program.\n\nOnce you have done that, the user mode program will have a \"live view\" into the memory of the target application, and can write whatever values it wants to disk.\n\nThat is assuming you have solved the problem of figuring out which virtual address you are interested in in the target application.\n\nNote that this is all quite difficult, and not something for a novice programmer to take on.  I used to do this kind of stuff for work, when I was working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week on it.  It was infinitely easier for me because I wrote the code for both applications and the driver, plus my driver was signed.

That's normal. The important thing is to apply it while learning. For instance if you wanna learn web dev, it's good to watch tutorials, read documentation, etc. while also working on a project thats feasible. I made a Pomodoro timer that was very customizable and it gave me a solid foundation in frontend and backend. Admittely it took some time, but it was well worth it. Hopefully that answers your first question.\n\n\nFor the second question, it depends. Typically, least with my experience, we use diagrams and pseudocode to plan stuff out. For instance, if we're making a database, we might make a diagram to see what links to what, what represents what, etc. Mostly trying to break a problem, feature, or idea into smaller pieces so that there are clear \"objectives\" that are manageabke.\n\n\nIf I'm debugging also I tend to keep track of the problem, what I've done to try and solve or find the issue, the result of each thing I've done, and ideas of possible places to look, which can help me stay organized with complex bugs that might take a couple hours. ",

When they start, there’s nothing to see. They add a little of this and a bit of that here and there, but none of it makes any sense — it’s just blobs of color. You could ask “wait, why did you put white there, what is that going to be?” But the answer wouldn’t be satisfying — they’d say “that’s a happy little light source” or “I wanted that area to be a bit lighter” or “when you blend it in you get all these nice colors,” and you wouldn’t feel any closer to knowing what the painting will look like. But it’s entertaining, so you keep watching, and slowly a picture starts to emerge from the blobs. Maybe there are a few new lines that suddenly give the blobs definition, or maybe you can’t quite say exactly when it became a picture — just that earlier it was blobs, and now there are recognizable forms. Maybe it’s not even that the painting changed that much, but that *you* changed — you looked at it long enough that it started to make sense.\n\nLearning about programming (and other things) can be like that: what you learn in the beginning lacks detail and context that aren’t available to you. You have to accept not fully understanding for a while. But the more you learn, the clearer the picture becomes, with each new thing adding to your understanding. You might have an “Aha!” moment where it feels like it all suddenly makes sense, or you might shift from confusion to understanding without knowing quite when it happened.\n\n\n> is there a general process or template to structuring the code?\n\nGenerally yes, but what the structure is depends on the language. Every language has rules of syntax that tell you how you can put words and symbols together to make valid expressions in the language, so that’s one level of structure. In some languages any valid expression can be a program; in others, there’s higher level structure that’s required. Either way, nontrivial programs generally have higher level structure: they’re not just a stream of statements, they’re broken down into modules and functions to organize the code and make it easier to understand and work on.\n\nDon’t worry if you feel like you’re not understanding what you’re learning yet. It’ll make sense in time.",

The 2008 Financial Crisis caused a 2nd \"bubble burst\".\n\nGo into CS because you enjoy it, but don't forget that the reason we get paid well is because not too many of us enrolled in Computer Science because so many people thought the bubble was bursting.\n\nComputation isn't going anywhere.  The need for programmers will continue to increase for decades.  AI will not replace programmers any time soon (in fact, it's becoming clear that it enables more modalities for computation and we'll need more).\n\nIt's silly to me that we jump right to the notion of AI replacing programmers and don't discuss all of the types of jobs that use a subset of the total skills required to be a good software engineer.\n\nLogically, before you see a programmer wholesale replaced you'd have to see Translators/Court Stenographers/Draftsmen/Accountants replaced.  They do a subset of work that programmers do with deterministic rules and regulations (which we don't have).\n\nThere are so many canaries that need to die before we should be concerned.\n\nIt stands to reason, how can a human hope to control a tool when they can't understand the output?  You need LLMs to produce code that works 99%+ of the time, out of the gate, to hope to replace us, and/or have an extremely robust system of feedback loops plumbed back into the LLM with 0% hallucination.  We're nowhere near that.\n\nI love LLMs in my own workflows, but it takes my experience to get the LLM on the right track even on small workflows.  Even with specificity, I'd estimate that the LLM gets it right way less than 30% of the time, and it's my ability to debug and suggest fixes is what gets me to working solution.",

Because the way this society is going, you're going to need a financial safety net larger than you're thinking right now. The societal safety nets are disappearing.\n\nIf anything happens to you and your capacity to bring in money, you're going to wish you had enough money such that your *money* generates money -- i.e., investments so large that you can live off the interest alone. And you're not going to have the leftover funds to invest with an average salary if you're ever laid off, get sick, get into a car accident, etc.\n\nMost of those people whose jobs you're eying won't be able to financially recover from a bad diagnosis, let alone retire.\n\nThink back to when you were in college and money was tight. That's going to be your life without a good income. You just forgot what that's like.\n\nIf you don't hear anything else I'm saying, just remember that you can always find ways to socialize and engage with your interests with a high salary. But a low salary is a limiting factor that puts hard a ceiling on every other aspect of your life. And I truly believe a person's earning power is the single hardest thing to change in life. So hard, in fact, that most people never do it.\n\nOnly quit your current line of work at your current company if you just can't stand to do it anymore and it makes you absolutely miserable.

You have the salary to do that and do it comfortably. But your friends with low salaries would have to live like literal paupers to do even half of that.

In order to do that, they paid out all the accrued PTO we had all gained. It actually worked in my benefit, I still was able to take the same amount of vacation I otherwise would've, but I had already accrued a bunch which they had to buy out, so I got a nice fat bonus.\n\nEven if your husband's in a State that doesn't require a company to do that, they *might* still do it anyways to keep people happy.

It's true that Meta is overall more \"intense\" but what this really means is that people don't coast. Getting high ratings and raises is very doable, which is why everyone is trying to do it, and I wouldn't say that's a bad thing. The E4 -> E5 promotion is probably easier to get at Meta.\n\nThe biggest differences in my mind are:\n\n1. Meta is more customer metrics driven; a good project is a project that made the numbers go up. Whereas Google is more focused on alignment: if the senior engineers agreed your design was good, and your leadership thought it was a good idea, and you executed it well, then it was a good project regardless of what happens after. On the positive side, this means that at Google you can spend more of your time on risky, speculative things; at Meta you have to think about your time more like an investment portfolio, with some things you're pretty sure will pay off to \"fund\" your riskier ideas. On the negative side, as you advance in your career at Google you have to spend more of your time sucking up to leadership, because there is no objective way to determine whether your projects were good so it is more of a popularity contest.\n\n2. Google has better engineering practices, infrastructure, and documentation. This follows from Meta being an entertainment company; Instagram users will come back even if the app crashes sometimes, but Google Cloud customers wouldn't tolerate this. Things break pretty often at Meta. The downside of this is that you spend more time firefighting during oncall. The upside is that it's much easier to ship things. Code and design reviews are less nitpicky and there are fewer barriers to just doing things. It does mean that more knowledge at Meta is in people's heads rather than written down, so you have to build out a network of experts. There is more chatter and context switching as a result, although overall there are fewer meetings which is nice.\n\nIf you were someone who disliked the bureaucracy  at Google, Meta will be a good change of pace. They are both good companies to work at, it's all about what you value.",

At least that's the workflow I've seen from people working in Data Engineering and Data Science.\n\n>\\[...\\] but I still think SWEs will still need to serve as an \"architect\" for the AI while the AI takes the role of the \"construction worker\" or \"builder\". \n\nThis all depends on if the whole \"trust in the trend\" holds out or not. Today's AI models just scaled up and made cheaper won't replace software engineers.",

AI takes on large amounts of technical debt, but (hopefully) makes it much easier to pay off this debt.\n\nMy manager handed me off a project that started as a vibe coding session. Basically they have no clue why everything is falling apart, so they created a dashboard to gain observability into service outages.\n\nThis dashboard is an Azure workbook with heavy UI elements that was created in the portal (browser GUI) and they decided they want this converted into code and deployed via CI/CD. Let's have Chad Jebity do it!\n\nThe result was this very large codebase that essentially creates deployment stages for every workbook that gets added into the pipeline and it iterates through a list to populate the data. It literally takes 20-30 minutes for me to run the pipeline and validate a change that usually takes 1 click in the browser.\n\nI've been trying to explain to them that this won't scale and will eventually have to get replaced, but trying to get them to understand Big O notation was like drawing blood from a stone. I've realized life is much easier if I just go with the flow and use those 30 minute pipeline runs as a break to focus on sharpening my own axe.",

And therefore the investment wasn't paying off.  CEO figures to cut the recurring maintenance cost of the third party product and your boss has said they can build an in-house tool that will be just as effective. \n\n  \nOn point 1 you should be aware that regulators regularly share findings with each other.   So if company A gets a 'noted deficiency' the other auditors look for that in other companies. \n\n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIt's also possible that your SVP is being defensive.

S/He's setting this up so s/he has evidence if the feces hits the oscillating wind generator. \n\nAnother way your SVP could be protecting themself is if they know there is some regulation or law that requires email retention or email monitoring.    They are proactively avoiding a whole series of audit comments and/or regulatory comments.  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIt would be interesting to know the dynamic between the Board of Directors and CEO.   The Board should have a Board Member responsible for Compliance / Audit.     If you can identify that person you could send an anonymous email cc'ing the Board Chair as well asking whether they were aware that email monitoring was being discontinued.

        "body": "Before you entirely abandon this field, here are some things that might help.\n\n1,000 applications is intense. But applying online is also a saturated channel and an increasingly inefficient one. In the past 3 years, a bunch of recruiters got laid off, and according to our data, there are about 3X fewer recruiters working now than there were in the first half of 2022.\n\nAt the same time, the number of (non-spam) applicants for eng jobs has 3X'ed since the first half of 2022. I don't have numbers for how many spam applications companies are getting, but if I had to guess, I'd say that it's probably another 3-5X increase.\n\nSo, recruiters are maybe 30-50X less productive than they were a couple of years ago. Which, for you, means that applying online isn't the best approach.\n\nBefore you completely give up and switch to a field that takes over 10 years to start making money, try doing outreach instead. You can give yourself a deadline. Something like, \"If I can't get some responses by January 2026, I'm going to med school.\" And until then, I'd focus on trying to get in the door.\n\nSo, what to do? I'm one of the authors of Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. We have a whole chapter on how to do outreach that includes some templates, and it's free: [https://bctci.co/free-chapters](https://bctci.co/free-chapters) It's the first document, and just go to Chapter 7: Getting in the Door.\n\nWhen you do your outreach, in the part of the template where you should mention something unique about you, try writing about how you were able to automate your job. I bet it's a good story.\n\nFinally, if you post a link to your resume/LinkedIn in a response to this comment, I'd be happy to review and share some notes. That said, you (and others in your shoes) probably don't need to spend lots of time on your resumes because recruiters typically scan them for brands, and either you have them or you don't. Anyone who tells you to spend a lot of time polishing your resume is probably selling snake oil.",

There's a lot of talk about tech being a boom-and-bust industry, but even to an experienced tech exec nowadays they've seen three busts:\n\n1. Dot com\n\n2. Great Recession\n\n3. Today\n\nThe difference with the first two is that tech (and especially web-based software + SaaS) has grown its talent pool significantly since 2008. One man's trash is another man's treasure. Once companies set in these Three Horsemen of the (Tech) Apocalypse (RTO, Offshoring, and Stack Ranking), those companies in the past would be seen as \"failing\" culturewise. However, in 2023-2025 the normal cycle of job changing was disrupted, so you have a lot of built-up dissatisfaction from people who want to change jobs, but can't find new opportunities. When opportunities arise at these companies with those qualities, the new folks may be arriving from something that was an even worse dumpster fire. A good example is GEICO. They fired swaths of their IT/SWE and have a 2.6 on Glassdoor. They are pretty much bottom of the barrel as far as large companies. However, if someone was working at Geico and transitioned into something like Amazon, they might find it a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe real problem at the end of the day is an oversupply of engineers.

It was pretty bad, I took it to my skip, my skip was on my side but there wasn't anything they could do besides try to mediate which my manager clearly wasn't open to.\n\nSo I kept my job, I kept a smile on my face and played good employee, I still let my manager/skip know I was unhappy with the situation, but I also reassured them I'm a professional and this won't impact my ability to do my job.\n\nI job searched, and left the minute I had something else lined up. Not a soul on the team was surprised when it was announced I was leaving. That's what I would do in your situation. I wouldn't try to play games with FMLA or anything.\n\nWith the opportunity to transfer to a sister team, you even have it better than me. I'd *absolutely* do that if it were presented to me. But only because that means I get a solid 6+ months to job search on the side, because that's generally how long it takes for someone to become productive on a new team.",

It’s good to see your skip is aligned on this, but you took all the risk for no reason. What I’ve found when dealing with micro managers is that you’ll be labelled defensive if you don’t agree with their views. It’s some sort of manipulative technique they use to gaslight you, fk that. I get called defensive every year but I still don’t see a PIP (exceeds last performance review).",

Is it possible there are actually growth areas for you that they've identified and you're being defensive and combative? This is really common with junior engineers - they start making progress and gain a little independence, think they're much more self sufficient than they actually are because they have no perspective on things, and then can't accept feedback because it means reassessing their view of their work as maybe not quite as perfect as they'd imagined. If you can learn to accept feedback and address the good stuff and let the incorrect stuff slide off your back without a strong reaction you'll be much better off.",

Side projects are very important and it shows that you enjoy / are interested in CS. \n\nSpeaking of, make sure before you go to school for CS I highly recommend doing some self learning and make something small. I know a lot of people who go to school for CS, spend the money and realize they don't like it mid-degree and switch OR even worse get their whole degree and not like to code. \n\nMake sure when selecting your major you aren't just picking something that \"makes a lot of money\" but also consider what you think is interesting. Then consider how you get there, and in many many cases you don't need a degree depending on what you decide. \n\nThe last advice I'll give is that college is always there. I get the impression you're younger, and from experience I think going to college right after high-school is one of the worst things about society. In the past going to college and \"figuring things out\" wasn't a big deal because it was priced very very differently. Now due to the cost of most colleges I'd rather recommend a new high school grad to spend time working and looking into career fields they find interesting. Then reach out and find people doing those things and see if you can find someone who will help answer any questions about what its actually like doing those things and the day-to-day.",

Firms tend to dabble in an effort to think they cs save money and that staff are fungible.  What’s not fungible is learning and understanding of vestigial projects. Where outsourcing works is when the team is seen as another dev group and can solve projects entirely on their own without constant supervision from home office because staff have relocated there and the firm is invested for the indefinite future. Otherwise it’s executives dabbling with consulting groups that fail because they need to call in more staff to do what is being asked or write better requirements. \n\nRe - AI \n\nJust another set of tools that really depend on where they are sourcing more than anything else. \n\nThink of moving from paper to a computer in the 70s to do bookkeeping.  The general ledger was a legit book where inflows and outflows were recorded. I worked on wall street where funds would calculate their values and holdings at the end of day by hand. \n\n\nThink of a circular saw , if you don’t know how to cut 4x8 sheet of plywood well your just going to do it faster than a handsaw. Same deal with a car - it’s great you can drive it but if you don’t have a general clue of where you’re going you are going to go somewhere quickly. \n\nIt helps you expedite but you need the expertise to understand holistically what you want to accomplish.",

Issue was that managers would open it and walk away, causing others to be unable to make edits because the workbook was locked. I was asked if I could force it to close after a period of inactivity.  Sure - after ten minutes of inactivity it would save changes and close.  But, one of the managers totally screwed up their edits and those changes were saved.\n\nSo I was asked if I could prompt user to see if they wanted changes saved or not, before auto-closing due to inactivity. I pointed out that that would defeat the entire purpose of automatically closing it because, you know, *they’d walked away from it*. So I was told to auto close it *without* saving - except next I was told that on the first business day of the month, some of the managers entered data and would sometimes have it opened but inactive for more than ten minutes while they were working on it, and one had just lost their desired changes.  So could I have it auto-close after ten minutes of inactivity, without saving, unless it was the first business day of the month, in which case I should auto-close but save it first?\n\nAn. Excel.

I did it - I also got told I was being “difficult” when I asked if the managers could just be told to *close the damned workbook when they were done using it*.",

You say he is emphasizing your “poor work”, is your work actually poor? Did you get comments from senior engineers before you started coding? It sucks that you are getting singled out, but you might be working on particularly sensitive or critical stuff and that might justify a much stricter review process.\n2. If you think it’s unjustified then you could try and have a 1:1 chat with the person in private and try to figure out what the problem is. You should not assume malice, they might be very busy. If you made an RFC previously, you should be ready to say you solicited feedback early and these concerns never came up, and that you’re finding it difficult to make progress at the moment because this late feedback is asking for major overhauls. You’re hopefully looking for them to back down, or for compromise, and to figure out how to avoid this problem in future. I would also think carefully about what this person is likely to respond positively to if you want a positive outcome, much depends on the individual here.\n3. If they are being really obnoxious and unhelpful, you could always just tell your manager, and possibly start disregarding the more persnickety comments. You should be very sure though that you’re delivering good quality work and management have your back. This is difficult if you don’t have rank though.\n\nOther than that, there’s not much else you can do.",

But he also was the AH engineer who cut people off, wanted to get in arguments over any little disagreements and would go on rants for over an hour if someone dared to disagree. People def walked on eggshells for him. The thing was, I think he basically knew there was very little they could do to fire him. This was in FAANG for a product that had many big time customers. Even with his AH behavior, he produced results even in his sleep. In my opinion he was like what teammates say about michael jordan, he wanted it so bad he didnt care if he was an asshole about it. It sounds great in sports but in an office job, it doesnt sound as great. He would tell my manager how to do his job. I could tell my manager hated the guy too but just was complacent with him.\n\nOne time I worked with him on something major. I could tell he hated my work ethic. Im not saying I was perfect but I felt like I was getting a hand on the work at that point. When I was done, my manager decides to have a 1:1 to discuss my work with him and I basically get a list of what I could've done better. I accepted it and tried to improve on it. But guess what was in my next review session when I got underperforming, all the shit that the higher level engineer had said about me. I accepted some that I felt I could've done better but tried fighting the ones I felt were unfair. One that I remember the most was that there was a merge I did that had too many commits. I admit that it did have more commits but it was because the change we worked on had like 20 different iterations because everytime I wrote one change in, it broke something unexpected so it was a lot of trial and error. That one merge was an outlier from all my other work but it was used against me for the following year. I got Pipd shortly after.\n\nI saw the writing on the wall but I gave the company 110% and then I got fired early this year, a year after I worked with that guy. It definetley was the beginning of the end when that one higher level engineer. I dont regret it I tried respecting my work life balance and I knew early on the job wasnt for me.",

I know lots of teams that have much \"harder\" interviews but then the actual role turns into just doing dull, bite-sized tickets assigned by somebody else.\n\nSo my only conclusion is that a team's hiring practices are, at most, a relatively weak signal about the team culture and the nature of the work.\n\nI would not try to draw any strong conclusions from your hiring experience. Instead, I'd try talking to the hiring manager, talking to somebody on the team and asking questions to understand the day-to-day experience as well as the broader context around the team and the work. This isn't full-proof—I just left a miserable role at a company despite talking to multiple past coworkers who seemed happy there—but, with social questions, *nothing* is fool-proof.

Some people took advantage of me, but I also made good friends who realized I would be a lot more useful over time if they treated me maps,\n\nSome percentage of those people will suck and some percentage will be great, and different ways you can swtup that funnel have different proportions. Eventually, you end up with a network of good people.\n\nThe more you have to offer, and the more unique it is, the better your conversion rate will be if you just cold message interesting people offering to work together. Probably the absolute peak for you would be on projects that are both tech products and can use your aviation background.",

People can be really full of it, and that's not fun.  My recommendation is to find an open source project that aligns with your interest and try to make ANY contribution and become part of it. It can be super small contributions, as long as you're addressing a problem, work well with others, document cleanly, etc. \n\nAs you do that you're going to meet people just by working. And you'll earn trust and build a role in a community from a really meaningful angle.\n\nYou don't need anyone's permission to *build* the type of community engagement you crave. I believe in you!",

After recognizing that, it's basic unwanted emotion management: Acknowledge the feeling and what it's telling you (this job is important to you), then let it go.  I find once I'm in flow, I'm fine, so it's just getting over that initial hump that takes effort.  You may have to try a few times to get past the feeling.  It's ok if this is difficult at first.  This is an important soft skill, and like all skills, it takes practice.\n\nIn my experience, it's actually really rare to be fired for performance unless you do like, literally nothing for months.  Usually it's some political game happening 3 levels above you that you have no control over, and performance is just the excuse they use to justify someone sacrificing their pawn to take a rook.  I have seen so many amazing engineers get fired for \"performance\" who were certainly out performing me.\n\nThe best way to protect yourself is to just be reliable, and get your work done.  You can't hit your target if you're watching everyone else draw their bow.\n\n~ Sincerely, a FAANG worker that has survived 3 layoffs (and probably a fourth, soon 😬)\n\nP.S.: there are two books that may help, though I've never read them.

I’ve long said that I think tech lead is the absolute worst job you can have and I think that that often falls right in line with this.\n\nThe problem is that you’re still expected to contribute code like any other engineer, but you start taking on more project management responsibilities that require heavy context switching. You end up doing 70% of two jobs that require very different skill sets and I think the only way most people manage is to put in extra hours.\n\nOnce you’re beyond that level, I think your WLB actually starts to get easier because you’re no longer expected to write as much code. The problems you focus on are harder, but you have the ability to make more time to think on and you’re able to step away from the day to day work more.\n\nSo yeah, I guess my point is that I think to get to any level above senior, you likely have to push through a few years of shit WLB, but beyond the senior level it actually starts to get better and not worse.",

And I did get a lot done. But the key thing is that my day-to-day was flexible, so I could adjust what I was doing and how hard I was working based on circumstances or even just based on how I was feeling. I got a lot done by doing high-leverage work and figuring out more effective ways to achieve my high-level aims rather than working long hours.\n\nBut that only worked because my manager was willing to trust me to make real decisions not just about how I was working day-to-day but also about what I was doing. I could go out, talk to people, understand their actual constraints and the interaction points between my system and other teams, then scope my work based on that rather than aiming for arbitrary deadlines or roadmaps. When you have the ability to just solve real problems rather than chasing output for the sake of output—and when nobody is trying to optimize your \"capacity\"—you can get a lot done without working crazy hours or burning out.\n\nOn the other hand, there are lots of teams and managers that do not operate like that. I've seen company planning processes that were clearly designed to put lots of artificial pressure on people and in those situations, yeah, a higher level role might be more stressful than a lower-level role. But even at those companies, at some point, you'll only be able to perform at a given level by doing high-leverage work rather than just working harder, so, if you don't burn out along the way, you'll learn how to have a large impact with reasonable(ish) effort.",

Is working a LITTLE MORE than 40 \"killing yourself?\"\n\nI'm not software but I am a senior engineer of a different discipline in a different industry (chemical engineer, at EPC), and if someone was only ever \"working\" 9 to 5, we'd be suspicious that they were working sub 40 hours a week, 35-40 ish.  Given we \"bill\" every hour because we have to invoice and get paid for our designs by clients who want them, 40 hours on your time sheet means 40 hours of work.  Not... 35 + paid lunch.  You can and will get fired for that.  You're free to report 35 + 5 hours OH, but people would ask why this is the case.  I am positive I will be techsplained how software is different (yes I am aware, this isn't the point here).\n\nNot to get all Office Space Stan on people, but doing the bare minimum with respect to anything generally does not get you ahead.  9 to 5 and anything more being \"killing myself\" really sounds like 15 pieces of flare and no more.  This isn't going to be rewarded, and it can be difficult to make a lasting impact if the bare minimum is all you're willing to do.\n\nIt might be different in software, but senior around my parts implies a willingness to put in the work / time / hours when it is necessary.  Projects succeed or fail on the willingness of the senior leadership corps to do what is necessary.  Seniors are the critical force that holds the project together, that is their impact.  After that, whether or not you experienced WLB during this time frame will be by how well a project is run, project schedule, how well defined a project is... all of which conspire to define how crazy a project is.\n\nFor your case, it REALLY sounds like if you want that high TC, senior title, with ability to make impact, you're GOING to need to make peace with high pressure and hectic environments, and then critically, be willing to put in the time when it is necessary.  So if your current work DOESN'T require this extra time and extra availability, then you're likely golden.  Keep on going on.  However, are your coworkers experiencing stress, working early, working late, to get things done while you're over here working 9 to 5?  Are you complaining openly any time work requires deviation from this (don't do this if you are)?  If you're working 9 to 5 while everyone else is working 7 - 6 and drowning... then you're NOT going to get senior there.  You're NOT in the trenches with your team.  You'll have to quit and get hired as senior somewhere else (good luck with that in this environment).\n\nFor reference here... \"Projects\" I work on are 1.5 to 2 year affairs, the larger of which can easily be 1000-1250 FTE for factories/sites that can run 20-25 billion once tools are put in, with base infrastructure being between ~5-8 billion.  Error bars on these projects exceed the total cost of other megaprojects.  So these are huge... long affairs, involving many people.  My point is, that for the longer durations on this, they look and feel a lot more like traditional work.  People will remember if you put the bare minimum in or not and if the project suffered because people didn't go above and beyond.\n\nFor context, I am currently on a mega project, we can't add anymore staff because we don't have any, and the project would benefit GREATLY from 45-50 hour weeks out of our junior engineering core for a month or three to get caught up.  A few are doing this, and their scope situation is improving, but several others are not, and they're behind.  Whether or not this is recoverable, is an interesting question.  I'm not lead here... thankfully.  So we have this weird situation where everyone is drowning short term, and the group is splitting into people who make an effort, and people who do the bare minimum.  The career consequences of which won't be felt for years.  For what it is worth, engineering staff gets straight time OT on billed work, so 60 hours means a 50% increase.  It's our bonus structure to reward additional work.",

This means that they want interviews that take them zero time to prep and “objective” evaluation criteria. \n\nTwenty years ago Google made headlines by asking brain teasers in interviews like “how many ping pong balls would fit in a jumbo jet?” This led to the rise of cargo-cult interview processes where you just grab two leetcode medium questions to ask in a 60 minute interview. If we run seven rounds like that then we can claim that we only hire the smartest 0.1% of all engineers. (Approximately none of that is true, btw.)\n\nIn other words, it’s popular because interviewers are lazy and there’s a huge population seeking jobs.\n\nHere’s my advice: give yourself a time limit to practice this stuff, but take s many real interviews as you can—even just for practice (and even if you fail). If you find a role that *doesn’t* do these kind of lazy interviews *go there* — the culture you see in the interview process is the culture you will see at the company.",

Not as much fun to do nothing all day when it's onsite. Sorry homie.\n\nIt sounds like you're doing the best you can. I'd ping your manager again just to check in and see where things are at, but not in a *needy* way. Just ask if there's anything you should be doing while you wait on the onboarding stuff, but I'd try to write the message in such a way that you are not concerned/bothered by it. Not a great move to annoy your manager on your first week, but it is still their job to...do something.

Was it *actually* 3 minutes? Not even 10? That's an alarmingly short intro call. If that's the case, I'd be prepared for him to be a very dont-give-a-fuck sort of manager. Ideally, that means your work life is chill, and not that everything is a scramble and you look bad because your manager doesn't do their side and throws you under the bus after the fact.\n\nI wouldn't sweat it yet, but there are a ton of managers out there who...need to be managed.",

        "body": "Quick caveat that if you're in India, I have no idea if this applies to you.\n\nIn my experience, which admittedly is only about 6 years so maybe a grey beard can correct me, is that the biggest mistake you can make is thinking that a technical interview is like a test at school. Most of the time they are not, and if you come across a company that does treat interviews that way, you don't want to work there anyway.\n\nA technical interview that's administered well and evaluated fairly is an evaluation of your problem solving process and your understanding of the technology you're working with. \n\nHere are my tips, many of which I've gotten from FAANG recruiters so I assume they're good for most of the industry:\n\n- Do not start coding right away. Collecting requirements is a good thing, and something that good interviewers will appreciate.\n\n- Always think out loud. You're better off talking through a problem than keeping your entire process internal. It allows the interviewer to hear how you arrive at a solution, what you're taking into consideration, and even allows them to interject if they have a suggestion or you've misunderstood the problem.\n\n- As you're outlining and then coding your solution, talk through what you're doing and mention trade offs. Stuff like \"I'm going to use DFS here instead of BFS because....\" will demonstrate to the interviewer that you're not just reciting a memorized solution and you understand the options before you.\n\n- Do not get nervous if you get stuck. I'm naturally a bit nervous, and my first reaction is to get very sweaty if I'm not sure what to do next and it's cost me positions before. When you get stuck, just stay calm and talk it through with the interviewer. Most of the time they're happy to provide a hint or two, and as long as you don't come across as entirely clueless, it won't count against you. I would even go so far as to say it might help you a little, since someone who gets stuck isn't using an AI cheat tool. At least they know they're not being lied to. \n\nIn summary, the technical interview isn't a test of whether or not you can invert a binary tree from memory. It's an opportunity to see how you solve problems, and the more junior the position, the more important coachability becomes, so taking hints and implementing them is not only ok, it's a good thing. \n\nBest of luck in your interviews. Just relax and work your way through the problem and you'll be fine.",

That said, a good interviewer should be nudging with \"You can probably start coding now\" or similar, when you've caught all the cases they expect you to.\n\nAlso; I give a strong hint that I'm really only interested in the core algorithm, not the data classes, or really even method signatures. Some candidates try to do these anyway, but if you can focus on the problem and not the boilerplate, that may help.",

Get something going, and then ask clarifying questions as new things pop up while you're implementing. You don't need to spend 15 minutes asking questions before you're able to at least *start* coding, right? The questions aren't *that* vague. You don't need to be \"fast\", I think they're expecting you to be \"agile\" and take an incremental approach. Just like they don't expect you to arrive at the optimal solution the first time, they expect you to arrive at the brute force solution which you then iterate on to improve.\n\nI'm just hypothesizing here, maybe I'm way off base. I'm not the greatest interviewer, but my interviews are very much agile. I'm extremely communicative throughout, but I jump into running through examples ASAP, and get what code I can written ASAP. I can work out ambiguities and questions as I go.\n\nAll that said, in the current job market, you don't need to be \"perfect\". I job hopped in 2024, which was also a very bad market, and for my current job I completely flopped one of the interviews. I did great at the backend oriented question, handled all the system design questions with ease, and then they hit me with some frontend stuff which is not my forte. I struggled, I needed hand holding, I didn't even get through the entire problem. And yet, I still got the offer.",

All too often LinkedIn has recommended me jobs that were terrible fits for me, but after going to the company's page, I found postings that were a perfect fit that LinkedIn's shitty algorithm hid from me. Or a post that is still open on LinkedIn, might be closed on the company's careers page because they just neglected to update LinkedIn.

I regularly reach out to people, even people I have never met in person.

But that’s kinda rad that you’re doing all that as a junior dev - it’s how you move up. A lot of places expect devs to be PMs themselves in many ways, and I do think it pays for devs to have good grasp of PM and solid technical communication skills. Sounds like a good challenge that could be a positive for the career!",

Make sure you communicate how you're spending your time, and if you see any risks of deliverables being late. Deadlines are estimates, do NOT work at nights and weekends to meet a made-up deadline. For instance when we plan capacity, we treat team leads like a part time developer as he has other responsibilities and don't expect him to be as productive as a regular dev.\n\nI'm currenty working in a large corp, and I miss having full overview and influence on the product, further enquiry customers regarding their needs, iterate over with their engineers etc. All I get now is the pipeline of jira tickets, small changes here and there on already existing design and framework, and all the bullshit of scrum ceremonies. \n\nLike, yes, someone can treat you like an assembly line worker and feed you little bite sized tasks but is it really what you want?

That's insane!!\n\nThe fact that you're handling client communications and requirements gathering alone is a huge red flag. Most companies wouldn't even let a junior dev talk to clients without supervision, let alone own the entire relationship.\n\nI've seen this pattern before. Companies dump everything on whoever's willing to take it, especially if you came from QA and they think you \"understand the business better.\" But just because you CAN do all this doesn't mean you should.\n\nYou're not crazy. This is definitely too much for a junior role. Either push back and ask for support, or start looking elsewhere. Don't let them kill your passion for development because they can't properly scope work.\n\nThe good news is you're getting exposure to a lot of different aspects of the business. Just make sure you're not sacrificing your mental health for it :')",

And what your manager writes and rates will be a reflection of the result they already know about. \nI've never seen a circumstance where the employees self assessment feeds into the result at all. \n\n\nYour results are formed in your regular one on one meetings with your manager months before. ",

Wasn't even a half hour after I walked out the door, they fully knew they weren't considering me short of their main candidate changing their mind. \n\nIf you want a positive, the place that did eventually hire me a few weeks later was way better and compensated me far more, with far better working conditions.

Have you escalated to your manager about the lack of access needed to do your job? Have you escalated about the unacceptable behavior that your lead did when they got back along with the failure of you potentially not have full access to dashboards and other information you should have access too?\n\nthis is not a hard-skill issue it is a workplace management issue that needs to be addressed by your management.\n\nIn terms of skills there are too many to list, I will also note many of the things that are classic DevOps are being automated or will be mostly automated so you will need to upgrade your skillsets to take advantage of the technology evolution that is occurring so you will be most marketable.\n\nThe enhancement of your hands-on skills are great, but mainly only useful if you are still physically hands on with servers, switches, etc. if you like doing that do not let your hands on skills degrade due to non-use.  For your virtual/physical setups be sure you still have a good foundation on Linux, Windows, and MacOS to be most marketable globally.\n\nLearn of all the different cloud providers capabilities pros/cons for AWS, Azure, GCP and start building in the cloud to include dashboards, building metrics, building automated workflows, etc. and see if you can upgrade your skills to the point to where you can move on to a new job.\n\n  \nMake sure you are also continuing to train using official and non-official high quality sources to keep your hard skills sharp.  If you are not networking outside of people you know at work you are doing a disservice, get out there and expand your network.  That way you can reach out to people you actually know to land opportunities.",

Knowledge tends to be closely guarded rather than shared, and that limits opportunities for others to grow. I’ve tried to stay respectful and focus on what I can control. When I escalated, I was promised more structured handovers and collaboration, but so far that hasn’t materialized. I continue to show up, do my part, and document everything when needed. The meeting is scheduled on my calendar and nobody shows up. My predecessor told me that this guy is the nephew of ceo and hard to work with. OTOH my project manager and Dev Lead are helpful. I’m grateful for that. \n\nI’ve been learning independently and had only a 10-day KT session with my predecessor. Since then, I’ve been handling responsibilities without ongoing guidance. While it’s not ideal, I’ve accepted the reality and adjusted my expectations. I’m committed to growth, and that’s where I’m placing my energy.\n\nRight now, my first priority is delivering on my current job responsibilities. After that, I’m preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. I’ve also started work on a side project that combines AWS with SageMaker, with a focus on practical applications of agentic AI. Progress has been slower than I’d like, partly because I’m doing it solo and don’t have a mentor to bounce ideas off. Still, it’s helping me apply what I’m learning in a more real-world context.\n\nAs for networking, I’ve been reaching out on LinkedIn and other platforms, but I’ve found that 9 out of 10 people simply don’t respond. I’ve also been trying to attend virtual and local seminars via Meetup.com. Unfortunately, events are quite limited in my country, but I don’t see that as a blocker. I’m not giving up. I know someone out there is looking for someone with drive and a willingness to learn. I just need to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nYour advice on staying sharp with hands-on skills, understanding cloud deeply, and constantly training through official and high-quality sources is spot-on. I’m applying it as best as I can and will continue pushing forward.\n\nThanks again for your guidance. If you have any suggestions on communities that are actually responsive or mentorship opportunities worth exploring, I’d be grateful to hear them.",

My guess is your use of the online tools let you squeek by without understanding the material, which has done you a massive disservice.\n\nThis degree isn't for everyone.

It doesn't mean that if you force yourself to present, one day all your anxiety and stage fright magically goes away and suddenly you're a pro presenter.\n\nIt means that the more you do it, the easier that anxiety becomes to manage, and the less it impacts your ability to present. The anxiety's still there. It'll probably *always* be there. You're not going to \"get over\" it. But you will absolutely become better at managing it.\n\nI also hate presenting. I've always been uncomfortable with it. In college, and early in my career, the anxiety would really get to me. The anxiety would hit me so hard I can feel my voice straight up changing, dry mouth, stuttering, stumbling over my words, rushing, I start sweating, if it's bad enough I'll be shaking like a leaf.\n\nWith years and years of on-the-job practice in the *professional* world, that anxiety slowly became more and more manageable. I think maybe 4 or 5 years into my career is when it became so manageable I started considering myself a *good* presenter.\n\nFor example, not long after I started at my current job, I got the chance to present a demo of a new feature to all of our stakeholders. It was a very not-casual call with 50+ people on it. I crushed it, I spoke slowly and clearly, I communicated my points well, it went great. I got multiple comments, and even a formal email to my manager, mentioning how great of a demo was, specifically calling out how well I presented it.\n\nThe anxiety was absolutely still there. Tons of it. Leading up to, during, and afterwards. But, at this point in my career, I can manage it to a point where it doesn't impact my ability to do an amazing presentation, it's not showing through my voice, or stuttering, or shaking anymore. I'm able to keep it mostly internal. Everything that goes into presentations today are very much leaned behaviors that come from practice.\n\nPresenting is going to be a very important part of your career. It gets even more important as you gain seniority, you're not going to be able to pawn that responsibility off for your whole career. Do the presentation. Keep doing them. It will get better. I'm living proof.",

Mid-demo the box froze. Without missing a beat, the demo guy, a 5.5 ft tall Indian version of Tom Cruise with similar steel nerves, pulls out the USB drive, inserts to the box debug port as the unit is rebooting, reprograms the unit in front of the CEO all while explaining that the unit is field upgradeable via USB. Unit reboots as expected and demo is great. The guy is now VP engineering for a major tech firm. \n\nYou don't need to be able to do that but an internal demo should be easy enough to start.",

As you become more experienced, senior+, your role does become inherently political and more about people. Would you consider maybe sticking with a salaried role but cutting your teeth on team lead or lower-level management roles?

Limiting your job search to a single area, especially in a bad market, makes the search significantly more difficult and time consuming.\n\nWhat's your plan if you can't line anything up for several months, or even a year? What if the only jobs you can find are ones that would require you to relocate a 2nd time to somewhere like Austin, or Detroit?\n\nIf I were you, and I wanted to relocate to the Bay Area, I'd line up a job there *first*, and then move once I have one lined up. That's exactly what I did in my current city actually. My new grad job was in the Midwest, which was fine, but I always wanted to move back to the east coast. So once I had a few years experience under my belt, I started job searching in the city I wanted to move in, and then when I had something lined up, I relocated. I can't imagine quitting my job and moving to a very expensive city unemployed. In fact I probably wouldn't have even been approved for my apartment if I didn't have a job, they asked for my offer letter as proof of income.\n\nThat said, what's your goal behind relocating? Do you *want* to live in the Bay Area? Or are you just looking for a hybrid/on-site job? If the latter, you can find those all over the US, there's a lot more places than just the Bay Area. You should be searching country-wide if that's the case, your job search will be way easier if you can lift the geographic restriction.",

In recruiting this is often referred to as a \"pipeline\" posting or approach. \n\nI've shared some thoughts below regarding the information that you brought up in your post. \n\n\\----\n\n**Timeline & Cooling Off Periods:**  \n  \nRegarding your viability, six months is a relatively short 'cooling off' period and most companies prefer to revisit after 12 months. This is generally a better timeline for a candidate building meaningful skills/experience/knowledge. \n\n**Interview Process:**  \n  \nHaving an initial 1-2 part technical screening and 4-5 part onsite (six total) is standard, and your seventh interview round being a repeat round indicates that you did show some potential but likely failed in one key element (coding, design, or modeling). Sometimes this can result in a down-level, but that might have been the reason for the follow-up, to confirm if they should reject or down-level. \n\n**Recommended Approach:**\n\nRather than trying to frame things as \"this position has been open for very long and you should reconsider me\" I would simply check in and see if they have any new opportunities that you can be considered for, and perhaps share some of the interesting work that you have been doing over the past six months that might make you more qualified. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with a periodic check-in, and hiring volume can often change things (more hiring is better for candidates, less hiring often leads to a more challenging 'bar' for talent). I would still expect that it could be another 4-6 months before they reconsider you, though.",

But even after improving and putting in more hours management would only grill me further. \n\nI knew it was a matter of time before a PIP. I had already started looking for a job. In between review cycles my manager pinged me 3 min before a 1:1 that someone would be joining the call. I knew it would be HR. They gave me the most generic of PIP’s in the world. I asked for specific benchmarks so I knew I was making progress and they refused. In the beginning I did put some effort into it because the job market was terrible but whenever I hit all the things listed on the PIP they would say there are other areas I wasn’t hitting and that even if I hit everything on the PIP I still need to hit all job requirements. Essentially I would get fired no matter what. Okay whatever. \n\nHalfway (PIP was 5 weeks) they said I wasn’t meeting expectations of the PIP. I stopped trying and instead focused on interviewing elsewhere. By the end of the PIP I still haven’t found a job but was in later stages of interviews with a few places. I got offered a severence package of 2 months salary and took it to “gracefully” leave the company. I also filed for unemployment. \n\nFound a job 2 weeks into unemployment and now make more money, have a higher job title, and aren’t treated like shit. And in addition to severence I got a decent unemployment check since the start date of my new job was delayed.",

The PIP requirements are generally unreasonable and it serves as an easy way to get rid of an employee with a HR approved paper trail.\n\nThe second is poor employee performance. Managers will use this sometimes to give a struggling employee a second chance. Terms are usually reasonable although this could limit future opportunities with the company.\n\nThe third is a way to implement a quiet layoff or a stacked ranking system. This is often arbitrary and unreasonable as well but one's direct manager has limited or no flexibility in the implementation.",

The person was about to receive a very low review after pretty much getting mediocre to low reviews their entire career at the company. They would get strong feedback and then do a little better for a little while. They were flagged by hr as a candidate for pip and I couldn't really disagree with that so we put together a pretty fair pip and the employee took the offered severance instead. The other one was all stack ranking driven at a different company. At that time the bottom X% were put on pip or straight fired. My group had a guy we liked but his impact had clearly been less than others at his level. He went on pip, succeeded and eventually became a respected EM at the company. I've never worked a place where someone would use a pip to get rid of someone they \"didnt like\". Im not saying those places dont exist but I've never worked at one.",

That's not junior dev stuff, that's some architecture level thinking. Your team lead probably just wants you to build confidence before throwing you into the deep end, not because you suck.\n\nThe competition anxiety is real tho. When I was building startups, I'd see people constantly worried about being replaced by someone cheaper/smarter/faster. But something Ive learned is that average devs who can communicate well and understand business problems are actually gold.\n\nAbout the PM pivot tho, honestly, it could work. You already have dev background which most PMs lack. You understand technical constraints, can talk to engineers without sounding clueless, and you've got that project leadership experience.\n\nBut before you jump ship completely, maybe try focusing on becoming a technically aware PM rather than abandoning code entirely. At Metana, we see tons of people who started as \"average\" developers but found their niche by combining technical skills with other strengths\n\nAlso don't let imposter syndrome make you quit something you might actually be decent at. Maybe you're not the next senior engineer, but you could be a damn good technical PM who actually gets how software works.\n\nGive yourself more time to figure out what clicks for you before making the full pivot :)",

One of the interviewers is going to ask about your experience and that's your chance to show off things you've built. If they can follow a link from your resume directly to your GitHub or to a demo website, that would be ideal. But it's also fine to just offer to share your screen and demo what you built for a few minutes.\n\nIf you have actual work experience, you don't need GitHub. Talk about what company you worked for and what you accomplished.",

Amazon, for example (at least when I was still there four years ago) only hired developers who were able to show subject matter expertise in anything, the rationale being that if you have mastered something, you can be expected to master something else that they wanted you to be an expert in so you were a safer bet than somebody who hasn't (because its an open question if they even can).",

Many of the layoffs we've seen over the last years are better explained as a correction for pandemic-era overhiring and as adjustment to turbulent markets – but saying you're doubling down on AI productivity sounds better for investors. I see strong parallels to ideas like offshoring.\n\n\nWhatever happens, human problem solving skills will remain valuable. Human software engineering skills will remain valuable, though the bar of what is hireable might become higher (and note that these skills cannot be acquired via vibe-coding). If AI coding agents turn out to be useful in the long-term, then security, QA, code review, and refactoring skills will become increasingly important.",

W\n\nSo, I really like Haskell, I really like compilers, I really like Databases, but I've decided to go for impact in my career and use the tech as merely a tool, and that's taken me to some interesting (and well rewarded) positions. I might be able to get a job doing any of those things, but those jobs don't put me on pace to retire early.\n\nAnyway, you'll be fine if you switch, as you've done very difficult programming in a team environment, and that experience will never leave you.

There's little growth in it in terms of products, no direct impact on revenue, a super long time from work being done to it's impact being seen. Most of the work gets anonymised. Whenever you get stuck with a bug , you need crap ton of people working to fix and there's a big downtime when they are not needed. So these roles are moving to places like China, India, Poland, Ireland etc.\n\n\nAlso, the stuff you are doing is not strictly at complier level and there's a lot of neural net design itself. The roles you are targeting, ...any company would simply prefer someone from PhD to fill that role.\n\n\nYour best bet is to use personal connections, expand the scope of your work to computer architecture and look for roles where intrinsics needs to developed.\n\n\nIt's not going to be easy to get a job simply because of nature of it but if you do find a good spot there's a huge payout.\n\nwhat companies are you applying for?",

That said, the military is no jobs program, when in you exist to serve, and that service is a sacrifice. If you want to fight, if you want to serve, do it, otherwise, you could easily end up worse off where you are today, in ways that will be difficult for you to imagine right now.\n\nTherefore, you need to try harder to make what you have now work. Expand your job search, hit pavement, look for roles outside of CS, be willing to move. You gotta hustle, and one way or another that's going to require a bunch more work that you are currently doing. Good luck!",

The fact that they already have customers lined up with 300-500k contracts is actually a really good sign.\n\nYour current situation sounds kinda stagnant tbh. Limited learning, backto back layoffs, product that isn't viable... even with job security till Q1/Q2 2026, that's not exactly inspiring. Plus being siloed into just applied AI work when you could be learning MLOps and data engineering, that's valuable stuff.\n\nThe founding ML engineer role sounds legit too. CEO with previous founder experience, both him and CTO are seasoned with relevant background. That matters way more than people think.\n\nAlso can you negotiate the equity up to 1% ? At pre seed that's not unreasonable for a founding engineer\n\nHonestly the fact that you're even considering it tells me you're probably already leaning towards the startup. Your gut is usually right about these things.\n\nOne thing tho. Make sure you understand the vesting schedule and what happens to your equity if they don't raise that seed round. But overall this sounds like a solid bet if the team checks out :)",

In that case then becoming founding engineer and having experience in MLops would open more doors for you long term.\n\nWould your answer change if I did mean traditional big tech like Google/Meta? Honestly, I have no preference. I'm just looking to get any big name on my resume to open doors and compensate for my no-name college. A big AI lab makes sense for my experience, but they're so competitive right now. I at least got an OA from Amazon (didn't advance, will retry in 6 months).\n\n>Learning wise do you want to go deeper into applied AI work or MLops work.

I wouldn’t think of it as being siloed but given opportunity to develop deeper expertise in that.\n\nYou're right that being siloed isn't necessarily bad. I frame it negatively because the current work isn't particularly deep - I'm not learning much. The challenging applied AI work is supposedly a few months away, but I worry there'll be another layoff before we get there.\n\n>Also are you excited about this new role?\n\nI'm not particularly excited about this role, but I'm also not a particularly excitable person 😅\n\nOn interviewing longer, wouldn't that mean turning down this offer? I can't leave them hanging for 2 months while I explore other options, right? (Genuine question- my job searches have always been quick)",

The difference is honestly it’s less competitive than joining the top AI labs (still hard), so you shouldn’t need more experience.\n\nWith your YOE and with ML background, I’d be surprised if you are still getting resume screened out. Have you tried real hard into applying to FANG adjecent companies? Where are you getting stuck there.\n\nYeah it would mean turning down the offer though, if you were to look elsewhere now and starting from scratch.",
