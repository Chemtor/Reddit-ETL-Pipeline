Why is a question only you can answer.\n\nNever EVER drop a table unless you have complete human sign-off.  This is pretty basic engineering principles: if you do it wrong, dropping is obviously the highest cost database operation. Not just financial cost but mental, as you learned. That means timing and communication matter a lot more than for general querying. Thinking through that ahead of time is one of the major differences between analysts and engineers.\n\nIn conclusion, you should feel badly enough to never do anything remotely similar.

I am in same situation and the simple answer to this is \"It's time for a new adventure, either accept the status quo and continue doing what you're doing, or pursue what you believe you're worth.\"\n\nFurther Details of my past couple of weeks- \n\nI'm an 8-year experienced Data Engineer who has been working at the same organization for the past three years. I was quite satisfied until I was asked to conduct technical interviews for few of new future team members with 4-5 years of experience each. The interviews went well, and I shortlisted several candidates for further rounds.\n\nLast week, I was pulled into a call with HR, the Team Director, and PM, where I learned that they had shortlisted two candidates, both with around 5 years of experience. However, both candidates turned down the offers, requesting better compensation. The salary they rejected was approximately $11,750 more than what I currently earn annually. I would like an extra 800$ every month, Who wouldn't?\n\nThis revelation devastated me. When I discussed it with friends, everyone told me there's no point trying to negotiate a raise with my current organization. They advised me to either start interviewing elsewhere and leave, or only discuss a raise when I have a competing offer in hand. According to them, there's no easier alternative - either accept the status quo and continue doing what you're doing, or pursue what you believe you're worth.\n\nMost companies show no empathy toward their employees and view them merely as workhorses. They constantly test boundaries, seeking maximum returns for minimum investment.",

I wanted to type up a pretty detailed summary of what I've learned about all of these tools and formats recently, when looking at what stack to use for my app's pipeline but, unfortunately, my hands are fucked... arthritis is definitely coming for me.\n\nMy super short summary, then, is that traditional databases use a proprietary file format to store data \"inside\" of the database (meaning it's not a file you can find in your file explorer and open); modern tools like DuckDB provide a query engine and enable SQL queries to be run on open-source file formats like parquet. Importantly, for my understanding, you can run DuckDB queries over many parquet files as if they were a single table.\n\nFor me, this has shifted the way I view what a \"database\" really is. I used to think of it as the thing that stored data and let me query it. Now, I view the query engine and the stored data as two separate things, with \"database\" still referring to the engine. Then, tools like Iceberg exist to define how multiple parquet files are organised together into a table, as well as dealing with things like snapshots, partitions, schema evolution, and metadata files... at the moment I view Iceberg like a notepad I would keep on my desk that says \"to query sales, read files A, B, and C into DuckDB\" or \"Added Row X, Deleted Row Y\" so it can track how the table evolves over time without taking entire copies of the table (it actually creates a new file called a \"delete file\", to my knowledge, that works kind of like a subtraction X - Y). That means there are now three parts: data storage, the query engine, and metadata management.\n\nMy understanding of the blogpost is that DuckLake replicates the kind of functionality that Iceberg provides but does so in a format that is compatible with any SQL database. This gives the management of datalakes database-like transactional guarantees, allows easier cross-table transactions, better concurrency, better snapshotting by referencing parts of files, and allows for things like views (which I guess Iceberg and other tools didn't?)\n\nMoreover, metadata is currently managed through file writing, and when performing many small updates or changes, this can be slow, and prone to conflict errors. Tools like BigQuery can be even worse, as they re-write entire blocks that have been affected by operations. DuckLake claims to solve for this by storing the metadata in a database, because they're typically good at handling high concurrency and sorting out conflicts. Correct me if I'm wrong there - that's definitely the limit of my technical knowledge.\n\n... if I ever get to work with these tools, I'm sure it'll be good knowledge to have!",

But then they put a catalog on top, which is a regular relational database that says \"the latest version of table X is defined by metadata file X.N\". If we're going to have a database in the picture, why don't we just put all the metadata there?\n\nThe problem I see is, I don't see how this gets adopted. Adoption of Iceberg was a multi-year process. Adoption of Delta was basically vendor-driven by Databricks and Microsoft. Right now I can't see a path by which DuckLake gets adopted by Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, MS Fabric, and AWS Glue. You need those readers in order to get to the users.",

Instead of having to think through how to handle things like incremental loads, materialization, and workflow, you can just focus on the model definition. It shifts the focus to creating and maintaining the business logic instead of the mechanics of getting data from a to b. You write your model to show you the output you want, and it takes care of the rest. We use dbt in our databricks pipelines currently, and it makes management of 100s of models MUCH easier. \n\nAlso, you can create tests using dbt to verify that the results you want match certain criteria - things like uniqueness, completeness, etc. it also has pretty good methods for tracking lineage and adding documentation, and you can create reusable macros across projects. Ultimately, dbt is a great framework for maintaining all the business logic that goes into semantic models.  \n\nAll that said, when it comes to raw ingestion, python notebooks or dlt pipelines are still the way to go. \n\nI don‚Äôt have any experience with snowflake, so can‚Äôt help you there!",

If you want to 1000 lines of raw SQL (no Jinja templating), you absolutely can. dbt will submit the query to the configured warehouse. If you really need every ounce of performance, write the giant query, but you can generally make pipelines much easier to read and maintain while getting acceptable performance.\n\nMy bigger issue with dbt is the invocation / scheduling overhead that can be difficult to see and extremely impactful on performance. My team uses Airflow and k8s, and we've had to refine guidelines on building DAGs a lot. Originally, we just used DbtTaskGroup() from [astronomer-cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos), but this approach introduces a lot of overhead for large pipelines with many small models. Essentially, it executes 1 dbt invocation per model. When you have dozens or hundreds of models, and you're waiting both for Airflow to schedule tasks and then for the tasks themselves to spin up k8s jobs, this can propagate delays through your pipeline. We ended up consolidating models into a small handful of tasks, which reduced runtime by 25%.",

Keep in mind that if a production process fails on the last step, and if you can't restart from the last step then an 8-hour process might now take 16 hours.  What if it then fails *again*?  And what if this is going on during a holiday, or the middle of the night when it's hard to get expertise to help?

You're assigning a huge importance to something one person - likely a non-technical manager - told you, ignoring the fact this person's job is to increase the ROI of hiring you.\nIs being full-stack really an advantage? I readily accept most new responsibilities, and my career has tremendously benefited from it. You do you, some people just want a clear, stable scope and don't mind not climbing the ladder, or have already done so.\n\nI'm skeptical of this whole idea that there are \"growing expectations\" on DEs. Who's expecting? Are these people in the room right now? This is such a one-sided, uncreative way of framing the behavior of interested parties.\n\nManagement and biz are obliged to wish for everything they can wish for, it's their job. If you could work for 10 people and substitute a huge, costly team, they'd love that. You're supposed to know this is what the incentives in place lead people to daydream about, and don't give it much thought. I'm sure you and most DEs have professional wet dreams of our own, that you know are not in any CEO's best interest and that they're also not supposed to worry about it.\n\nThe only relevant question is: is there a Nash equilibrium in the DE job market in which most companies have overworked DEs wearing 5 hats at a time?

Yeah, if you make it more complex than a super simple app, you should design it carefully. That's not a unique concept to Streamlit but people still write blog posts acting shocked when packing 2k lines of code in a single file without a thought for state management doesn't scale the way they want it to.\n\nThe argument in this article that custom components are a mess is BS. Go look at the code for most of the custom components that exist. Most of them are the simplest react wrappers you could imagine, plus a normal developer using streamlit doesn't even have to worry about any of that. Not once have I ever had to get into debugging anything besides python when working with streamlit (even when using custom components, which is absolutely not required) so why would the fact of how they are built even matter to the average joe using streamlit?\n\nCompare what you can do in a single file with a few lines of code in Streamlit vs what the equivalent would be in asp.net or react.

Have you seen the [dbt Core roadmap we published yesterday](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/docs/roadmap/2025-05-new-engine-same-language.md)? It talks about our plans to continue supporting and adding functionality to dbt Core.  \n  \n2. Totally understand having some questions about the ELv2 License. [You can read more here](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/new-code-new-license-understanding-the-new-license-for-the-dbt-fusion-engine), but the gist of it is as you can adopt it, use it, share it, modify it, all without talking to us or registering at all. The only restrictions are around building competitive managed services or circumventing the license keys. If you use dbt core at your org for your data pipelines today, you can use the dbt Fusion engine for that same work in the future. You can check out [this post for more details](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components), but I'd be really curious to hear what's on your mind!",

Iceberg should be able to accomodate a heavy write load and most OLAP necessities, granted that you have a good query engine on top like Dremio, Trino, Starburst, etc. You can segregate and organize tables in separate schemas/databases and use a data catalog to keep everything in check.\n\nOnly if you need near real time freshness and low latency reads you should consider a separate datastore.\n\nAs with everything YMMV",

It's easy and any DE team should be able to do it without much hassle.\n* In my previous job (small shop, leading a small team), I considered implementing dbt for a couple of years before actually doing it and absolutely regret the wait. It's night and day, really. Recently changed jobs to a very early stage unit within a large org, and it's one of the first things I set up.\n\nHonestly, just do it. Can't recommend it enough.",

The biggest benefits I‚Äôve seen are that I can easily test changes throughout the entire pipeline. Before I could only test one script/query at a time. Additionally, we have implemented data quality testing throughout. Mainly to ensure that primary keys are unique and not null. We are also defining foreign keys. This makes it easier for data consumers to use the tables and for us developers to understand to ensure that they are what we intend them to be. \n\nThe docs site is nice, but I find that few data consumers actually use it. \n\nWe use GCP. I love using dbt, but if I was to start over today I would probably use Dataform as it is fully integrated in GCP. The thing that makes me nervous with dbt is that they are very profit-driven and continue to try to balance their open source offering vs their paid services.

Anything non - software really.\n\nIn all of these situations the firm doesn't want or doesn't care to build the expertise you need to manage an on premise data center. Not only do they not have the budget allocated to hire full time permanent IT staff, they usually don't have managers skilled in building or maintaining technology infrastructure teams. They also usually don't have the culture required to do site reliability properly. \n\nImagine at Bank XYZ you ask for a new server. You have to call the IT team, they have to call their manager, get approval, the guy who buys server racks is on parental leave, sorry you'll have to wait for 3 more months. Not to mention, the manager of that team decides to de-prioritize your request because guess what, when Bob Servers came back from leave he got a better offer from Google and left. Or in hardware companies you often have tons of people who can CAD, but a handful who can code. \n\nYou're only thinking from the perspective of the TECHNOLOGY. It's not about the TECH. It's about the ORGANIZATION. They don't WANT to be TECH companies. They can't recruit developers, they can't retain developers, they can't manage developers, they don't have code quality standards, the limited devs they have are swamped with managing legacy infrastructure that sucks because it was built on top of technical debt and needs to be refreshed.\n\nNow, if AWS or Google or Azure come along and say, \"hey you can store 300Gb in object storage for $30/month and we handle patching/security etc.\" do you think anyone in these companies would say no? If you're the only data engineer in company ABC that makes widgets for robots, do you think you'd say \"actually let me configure an on premise data center all by myself, configure all the users, and install Ni-Fi and also let me patch it and renew certs and everything else all by myself, and when my boss yells at me to take shortcuts to please people that don't understand software I'll tell them no\" \n\nDo you really think that will fly? Who do you think wins the political battle here? Experienced data engineers aren't thinking about just the tech. They're thinking about the CONTEXT they are working with. Bank operations are about securing lending and loans, personal data, etc., managing risk; IT just facilitates that. So naturally, a cloud vendor flush with cash offering to take some of that risk is a nice feature. \n\nHardware companies want to make quality parts and components at lower prices. If someone says \"hey you can set up your robot telemetry log using AWS IoT offerings..\" what would you do?",

System design - you'll get asked to design a batch/streaming pipeline for some scenario. Know your Kafka vs Kinesis, star schema vs snowflake, batch vs micro-batch trade-offs.\n\n3. Take-home - these suck but common. Usually building a small ETL pipeline with test data. I had one where I had to build a pipeline that transformed reddit comments into a star schema and ran some basic analyses.\n\n4. Behavioral - standard stuff but focus on data quality, testing, and how you've handled data issues.\n\nBest advice: brush up on SQL window functions and Python data structures. Also be ready to talk about data quality - every company is obsessed with this right now.

I use it for our NLP pipelines where we extract entities from news articles, transform with Python, then load to Postgres. You can build the lineage visually and it handles versioning through git.

So yeah, I think DE is more future proof. \n\nAlso, AI and LLMs might still just be a big bubble that could pop anytime. DE feeds finance, BI, ecom, AND data science functions. And if one of those collapses, there is still plenty of data demand from the others.",

Are you talking about like adding columns or adding new fact and dimension tables? Any data warehouse will require maintenance, add new features, etc. but if you are doing a regular major rework, that is either a business issue or you may need to consider evaluating a skill gap on your team around data modeling.\n\nLastly, this would be a poor KPI. Like some other folks of said, it would be similar to counting lines of code. If you are looking for some good KPIs, general ones that I‚Äôm a fan of are:\n\n1. Data Quality time to resolution. How long does it take from when a data quality bug is reported to it being fixed.\n2. How many Data Quality issues get through to end users. If you do not have a good data quality test suite in place, you will end up with a lot of bad data getting presented to end users which loses trust and can potentially be costly to the business.\n3. Data Platform uptime. The percentage of time the data platform is available and appropriately supplying data. An example would be is if you have a pipeline fail and new reports can‚Äôt be generated, that would be counted as downtime.\n\nHope this helps. Evaluating the success of a Data Engineering team can be tricky because there is a lot out of our control so whether it is fair or not, we have to play what I call ‚Äúa lot of defensive‚Äù to ensure we are in a good state. But once you get the above 3 down, you can then maybe target something like how fast you can ‚Äúonboard a new feature‚Äù.",

As others have said:\n\n\\* adds valuable cred to your resume  \n\\* you may have the opportunity to work with some really great engineers (don't waste that)  \n\\* bigger money early on to put into investments has outsized impact later on due to market growth.  You can never catch up by investing later in life to what you will have if you invest now.  \n\\* in-company raises are almost always % based.  A 3% raise on $160k vs $120k, and potentially yearly going forward, adds up over time  \n\\* negotiation leverage at your next job for a higher starting salary if you are switching from making, say $165k vs $124k or whatnot. \n\nI love the advice someone else gave about taking feedback well and doing your best to learn from it.  I think humility, curiosity, and willingness to learn are some of the very best traits you can have.   (the humility to graciously admit when you don't know something, or when you are wrong, will pay off in spades over time as you grow)",

This happens all the time.\n\nAnd there's a number of significant issues with this approach:\n\n   * Data pipeline duration: processing 50 TB of data is probably not happening in 10 minutes, whereas a single day's worth of data might.  And that means that when it breaks it may be down for a *long* time.  It may require engineers sit babysit it all night long, and multiple shifts of engineers to work together to get the broken data pipelines back online.  That translates to engineer burnout, bad availability metrics and business outcomes.   Painful fix processes also push teams to deploy new features less frequently rather than more - which is another bad outcome.  \n   * Data pipeline latency & update frequency: they're only processing daily because presumably their volume, and usually because they pushed back against more frequent runs throughout the day.  It's rare in 2025 to find teams that really don't want the data more often - say every 5-60 minutes to reflect some data they just added to a spreadsheet, etc.  Also, if they ran their pipeline every 5 minutes then it it would be far easier to deploy features daily instead of monthly or quarterly, and  they could see when there's problem - in the middle of the day when all the engineers are available to fix them.\n   * Restating history: there's no single simple answer to what to do when you want to \"change dimensions\".  Because if your changes, possibly to fix an error, restate history now your data won't match what you've already published and have the business, and maybe customers using.  It's great to fix errors, but it's not great to change history without letting people know.\n   * Cost: it can be expensive to reprocess 50 TB of data on a daily basis.  Say you're using snowflake and dbt, one could spend $500k - $1m/year on such a task, depending on number of models/complexity/etc,  as opposed to a tiny fraction of that for incremental processing.  And while some companies are rolling in the cash, it's always just a matter of time before belt-tightening happens and people need to fix that.\n   * Why not do both?  While I'm not a fan of DBT in general, in the past I've supported data pipelines that ran incrementally unless you ran them with a refresh option and then some also always ran a full refresh periodically.  So, there's room for nuance here.",

This will let ClickHouse run your queries in literally milliseconds.\n\ne.g. suppose you have logs that have the columns: id (unique), timestamp, app, machine, country, message. Where each app runs on many machines and each machine is in a country.\n\nHere you want to set the ORDER BY such that the lowest cardinality items come first. Since you have few distinct countries, more distinct machines, many distinct apps and very many distinct timestamps it should be:\n\nORDER BY (country, machine, app, timestamp)\n\nThis will store the data sorted on disk in a way that will make GROUP BYs very efficient. You can expect queries of under 1 second on an 8 core machine.\n\nHowever also note that ClickHouse is very fast. Even if you don‚Äôt set the group by optimally it will likely still execute your queries in under 1min.\n\nWhilst it‚Äôs hard to give exact numbers I‚Äôve given ballparks for what you can expect for illustration to help you decide whether you want to do it or not.\n\nEdit: another thing to note is that ClickHouse will compress your data to speed it up and use less disk. With the correct schema you can likely store 1tb in a few hundred gbs. If you post your schema I can help.",

There's other views after that but the point is to store unstructured, then structure on read. You can do stuff like materialised views if you need more performant reads. The benefit of this approach is your ETL doesn't break if the object contents change, and you can always just change the views to reflect evolving schema. It's also very easy to build, and I'm big on simple, managed solutions because engineer time is expensive and niche solutions are a headache to reverse engineer.",

It's super Python-friendly, easy to set up, and perfect for building dashboards with charts, filters, file uploads, and even inline data editing using plugins like streamlit-aggrid. Since you‚Äôre already using SQLAlchemy, integrating CRUD operations on the backend is easy. If you ever need more customization down the road, Plotly Dash is a great next step.",

Streamlit is pretty good for prototypes and small projects.

A bigger risk point is if the delete+merge strategy fails during the run you could see data loss, but that's fairly unlikely and also why we have a redundant backup.",

Reward : You will always find someone who shows more interest and passion towards DE than the others, reward them, meaning, additional responsibilities like leading a group of interns to build end-to-end pipelines, let them figure out.\n\n3.

At my company we have different internship programs for undergrad and grad students, I work only with the undergrad program. \nWe don‚Äôt have a specific rotation plan. Since we‚Äôre a consulting firm people tend to naturally rotate projects, and interns follow that once they convert into full time employees (usually happens after around 1 year of internship ‚Äî in my country internship contracts can last up to 2 years, and at my company we aim to convert interns into FTEs, we don‚Äôt hire juniors, they come exclusively from the internship program). The way our program is structured is around 6 months for the learning plan (since they are undergrad students we don‚Äôt expect/require previous experience or extensive knowledge) and the remaining internship period (this can change from intern to intern based on their needs/progress) is spent allocated on project (usually the same one).\nWe don‚Äôt have any official rewards system, but as a team our approach it to give the interns opportunities to explore according to their development and interests. Things like interns joining POCs, internal projects, etc. \nWe have a dedicated budget for the internship programs, so any courses/certifications they take are covered by that and we provide access to the O‚ÄôReily learning portal. These are not rewards though, they are part of the internship program.",

This is actually a project I've completed recently - moving processes from legacy to Fabric PaaS. \n\n\nYes! \nA lakehouse definitely can be the origin for a dataset and be the only 'source' for this data.  \n\nThe important aspects to consider before choosing to use the lakehouse as the origin location for the data will involve your governance and auditing practices, how robust your lakehouse setup is, how reliable your processes are to ensure proper testing / auditing. Etc.  \n\nIts the same concern you'd have keeping a data set in any location. In reality, depending on your use case and how your data sources store the data once its extracted, once your lakehouse ingests the data from the external sources, the external source may not always maintain a copy of that data, leaving it only in the lake of the lakehouse. \nSame sort of idea as using the lake & lakehouse as the data origin for a 'new' dataset that isn't derived from a raw external data set. \n\nIf you're performing transformations on the raw 'bronze' or even 'silver' data, you are creating new datasets likely being held ONLY in the lake or lakehouse, unless you then moved those datasets into a different warehouse or system.\nThese new transformed datasets may be derived from the raw external data, but they are new datasets in tables in the lakehouse. \n\nI think you'll find lakehouses to be powerful and friendly for rule-based processing. \n\nIf the lakehouse is ONLY being used as a glorified ETL platform, it's kind of a silly misuse of the power. \n\n(If you have a strong data governance program requiring you to maintain storage / system of record elsewhere, then obviously the lakehouse is not the long term storage place. But this has not been the case in my experience, outside of heavily regulated industries... which generally have so many redundancies in place the data ends up living in multiple places )\n\n\n\n\n\nFor clarity in how this is possible: constraints being business setting the rules and editing the data set.\n\nim not sure exactly what platform you're working with or what type of lakehouse you have, but an example way to do this for microsoft fabric:  \n1. Create a rules table that lives in the Fabric Lakehouse (Delta format).\n2. Let business users edit those rules (via Power BI, powerapps, excel ).\n3. Build a processing logic (in Notebook or Dataflow) that applies the rules to a dataset. \n4. Trigger the Fabric pipeline when rules change or on a schedule.\n5. Store the final result back in the Fabric Lakehouse. \nBecause the users can change the rules themselves, be mindful to keep a table with every recorded change if you're concerned about data loss or potentially having a need to review the intermediary changes that occurred on the datasets.\n\n[Big ND energy over here - hope the details help]",

If you let business users run SQL you are significantly increasing the risk.\n\nIf you are determined to go down this route then I would ensure that the data model presented to users is as simple as possible with limited opportunities for users to make things up for themselves - so this probably means creating views that pre-join your tables and where all calculations are pre-defined, and then only giving users to these views, not the underlying data.\n\nI would still limit them to running simple SELECT... WHERE...GROUP BY statements.\n\nOut of interest, have you asked your business users whether they want to be able to run their own SQL rather than, for example, using a graphical report builder (BI tool) where they can drag and drop fields onto a report?",

I use upsert sort of loosely here because if you have append only, then you can simply create a temp table in bigquery with all the staged data, query your existing warehouse for any matches, if there are any matches then you can delete all the matches from your temp table, and then insert whatever is left into the warehouse.",

Another upside is the efficiency boost from removing those joins from the downstream query processing.\n\nI'd also recommend exploring materialized views which would join and construct the nested records from the changing historical data.",

Like a Data Analyst would work well with dbt docs, but perhaps someone like in Product, Finance, etc. who are heavy data users but are less data-stack technical may struggle with it.\n\nThat is where Data Catalogs (which they themselves aren‚Äôt perfect) can help but in my experience, I‚Äôve always ended up figuring out the best way to communicate data products to internal/external customers and just write some basic tooling to kick out documentation that can then be updated in Confluence or notion.so\n\nI can appreciate the frustration but it is important maintain empathy towards less technical users and finding a way to both manage docs that works for you and your team, dbt docs, and then figure out how to you reduce double work by packaging it up that other teams can engage with it.\n\nDocumentation is a tricky thing because so many people don‚Äôt take the time to do it well. Just like anything in the Data Engineering (or even Software Engineering world), you need to take a step back, evaluate the need, and then figure out how to address that need at different levels:\n\n1.

Data Analysts: Your ‚Äúpower data users‚Äù typically are served fairly well by the same above docs because they are wanting to understand lineage, data freshness, etc. for when they are building dashboards/reports\n3. Product/non technical business users: This is where it gets tricky, need to assess their specific needs and tailor solutions to them. This is key because if you don‚Äôt do this, your teams value may be missed.\n4.

For example, if you had a DataFrame with the tablename, api, and offset cached, then when you chain a proper spark filter off of that it can avoid making API calls for the other tables in the first place, because it can apply the filter earlier in the sequence (as the value never changes). It can't figure that out when you're using rdds and lambdas.\n\nAlso, it has to serialise every row to python, so python can deserialise it, just so that python can execute a basic equality check.

        "body": "> how about check pointing?\n\nRDD checkpointing should give you a similar effect, but only within a session and only if you specifically pull that RDD by id. If you rerun the pyspark code you'll generate a new RDD definition. Even though *you* know you'll get the same result, spark can't tell, so it is a new RDD.\n\n> I start from RDD but you start with UDF\n\nThat's not really the distinction. Both versions are running a python function on the executors with input args being sent over from the spark data. The only distinction with a UDF is that the `udf()` call is a wrapper so that you can call the function as if it were a spark function and send it column definitions, whereas in an `rdd.map()` you pass the function reference (rather than call it), and it takes the whole row as its arg.\n\nThe main difference is to process everything once and just save the json output as text as you go with no further processing. That will complete the data retrieval step, without mixing in possible issues or errors from anything else that could unnecessarily cause you to have to hit the API again. It is a lot like making a 'bronze layer' for your overall process. There's likely little overhead in writing then reading back the data, since it can likely write the data while it is still processing requests, and also because spark is going to have to go over the data multiple times to infer the json schema anyway.\n\n> What is the benefit of using UDF over RDD in first place?\n\nAgain, it isn't a UDF over an RDD. A UDF is just a way to wrap a python call so you can use it as if it is a spark function that takes columns as input, rather than passing a function reference and that function having to take a whole row.\n\nFor one thing, it is a bit faster because spark only has to serialise (and python deserialise) the specific columns that go into the function, which can help performance when the row is very wide. It also means that spark can potentially skip execute the UDF entirely, if its output isn't required for anything.\n\nA benefit with using DataFrames is that spark can optimise things by cutting out steps that aren't necessary. Here as an example you can run locally -- just do a `pip install pyspark` and make sure you have openjdk17 with JAVA_HOME set.\n\n    import json\n\n    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n    from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, lit\n    from pyspark.sql.types import StringType\n\n    spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\n\n    data = [\n        (\"A\", 0),\n        (\"A\", 100),\n        (\"B\", 0),\n        (\"B\", 100),\n    ]\n    input_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=\"category STRING, offset INT\")\n\n    input_df.show()\n\n\n    def python_func(category: str, offset: int) -> str:\n        with open(\"side_effect.txt\", \"a\") as filewriter:\n            filewriter.write(f\"{category}:{str(offset)}\\n\")\n        return \"--\"\n\n\n    python_func_udf = udf(python_func, StringType())\n\n    (\n        input_df.filter(col(\"category\") == lit(\"A\")).withColumn(\n            \"python_func_call\", python_func_udf(col(\"category\"), col(\"offset\"))\n        )\n    ).write.format(\"noop\").mode(\"overwrite\").save()\n\nIf you run this once and open `side_effect.txt` you'll see that it *only* has rows where the input data `category` column is equal to `\"A\"`. Spark *completely skipped* processing the other rows, and the python function was never called for them.\n\nIn your original example spark *cannot* know what the result of the filter is going to be, because it is being done in Python code. Therefore it must execute the entire source RDD and push every row in its entirety through the filter function in order to get the correct results. This is what causes the execution of the 'invoices' json rdd to also hit the api for the purchase_orders endpoint, even though that data won't go into that RDD.\n\nIf you use DataFrames from the beginning, and use a DataFrame filter to pick the table you are processing, spark will *only* hit the API for the rows that match your filter, even though you specified the filter in a later step. You could avoid this double-processing without even trying.\n\n---\n\nThe actual suggestion is to stick with DataFrames and just save the data immediately. Then after pulling down the data from the API -- which is *highly* likely to be the slow part -- and saving it, you can just read it back to do everything you need. You *have* the data, you just need to process it. You can take the response json strings and write them out to 'text' files, then read them back in 'json' format and spark will do all the schema inference for you. You can even automatically split up the writes by table in a single pass by setting a partition on the tablename, then read back just the files for a specific table.\n\n    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n    from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, explode_outer\n    from pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, StringType\n\n    spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\n\n    # set up API calls\n    data = [\n        (\"Invoices\", \"https://api.example.com/invoices\", 0),\n        (\"Invoices\", \"https://api.example.com/invoices\", 100),\n        (\"Invoices\", \"https://api.example.com/invoices\", 200),\n        (\"PurchaseOrders\", \"https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders\", 0),\n        (\"PurchaseOrders\", \"https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders\", 150),\n        (\"PurchaseOrders\", \"https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders\", 300),\n    ]\n    input_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=\"tablename STRING, endpoint STRING, offset INT\")\n\n\n    def fetch_responses(endpoint: str, offset: int) -> list[str]:\n        response_body = YOUR_REQUEST_RESPONSE\n        return response_body\n\n\n    fetch_responses_udf = udf(fetch_responses, ArrayType(StringType()))\n\n    # define the process to fetch the data and save it as-is to avoid reprocessing due to errors\n    responses_col = fetch_responses_udf(col(\"endpoint\"), col(\"offset\")).alias(\"response_array\")\n    get_everything_df = input_df.select(\"*\", responses_col)\n    get_everything_df.write.format(\"parquet\").save(SOME_SCRATCH_SPACE_PATH)\n\n    # use the saved data to generate the per element data and save to separate folders per table\n    fetch_each_col = explode_outer(responses_col).alias(\"response\")\n    per_element_df = get_everything_df.select(\"tablename\", fetch_each_col)\n    per_element_df.write.format(\"text\").partitionBy(\"tablename\").save(SOME_PATH_FOR_YOUR_JSONL_TABLEDATA)\n\n    # now read back for your desired tablename - this uses the hive style partitioning to pick just one table\n    invoices_df = spark.read.format(\"json\").load(SOME_PATH_FOR_YOUR_JSONL + \"/tablename=invoices\")",

For a pure notebook feel with SQL superpowers, try DataStation or Querybook (from Pinterest). Dealt with this recently when setting up a data analysis workflow across teams - DBeaver ended up being the most reliable for heavy postgres work, while DataStation was better for mixing SQL+Python for quick viz work. preswald is also worth looking at if you need interactive dashboards/sharing beyond just sql notebooks - lets you write sql/python in the same space and outputs to interactive apps.",

So that you can do the solution in a naive way and still get a passing, because is what I actually care about as a dev. You are able to understand and solve the issue, not that you can do in the most efficient way, that you only need to do it as a refractoring after it has been assessed that we need performance for that specific task.\n\nClassic example is to be able to do what they ask for string 10\\^12 carachter long in less than 200ms.\n\nAnd that's bad for two reasons:\n\n1. A requirement like that in a professional setting would have probably been stopped at the source:  why do you have a string this long, and do we really need a string this long ?\n2. A lot of times, the DP solution is worse than the native solution for smaller sets. Something simply because it's harder to understand and as a general rule of thumb you want to make your code easy to understand, and also because sometimes is just less efficient for small sets because it requires some overhead work that the naive solutiomn won't need and while the naive solution is 0(n\\^2) instead of O(log(n)) for strings less than 200 carachter the naive solution can be faster.",

Every book that offers at least one advice or reminds you of something (may it be simple and obvious) that you just lost track of, is a good book :D\n\n  \n\\-> Certain courses and other material is important too, since nowadays there are other ways to learn also, for example via. AI / Audio books / podcasts / streams / videos / meet-up's / lectures.....\n\n\\-> Books are not and will never be fully replaced, due to their availability and independency\n\n\n\nIf anyone is interested in specific books that have to do with game development, contact me in a DM or on this post, then i may give some recommendations and some \"not worth it\" mentions hehe.\n\nKind regards, \n\nMr. Prototype and the Broken Pony Studios team :)",

Like your python program might pull in a networking library and do some basic stuff like scrape a website. But then if you have to implement your own networking library because of some weird requirement you're in a world of hurt because you don't know how anything actually works and/or you don't really understand how to write an algorithm or architect larger software. So this owl might actually be three: understanding the technical details of various parts of the stack, how to write an algorithm that's correct and performant in the right way, and how to structure larger pieces of software for things like maintainability, clarity, testability, etc.  \n  \nSecond owl, I think, is \"productionalizing.\" There's an old meme or joke about \"works on my computer\" which is a groaner for professional programmers who have had to deal with the kind of amateur cowboys who write code that only sorta kinda works, like they ran it once on their computer, and pushed it out to production, breaking everything. Making a program work at all is like the prototype phase, then like 90% of the work is making it correct, robust, reliable across different machines, etc. That's a whole discipline.",

In that case, it's not only that the client cannot see the response, but the browser also won't send the POST request in the first place unless the server first allows it via CORS headers in response to an OPTIONS preflight request.\n\nThat's not true for all POST requests though. Form POSTs specifically predate CORS and developers have always been allowed to submit a form to another domain by simply creating `<form action=\"bank.com/...` HTML and either tricking the user into clicking the submit button or submitting automatically with JS. This wouldn't allow an attacker to see the response to a cross-domain form post, but it would allow you to make the cross-domain form post. Browsers retained this capability because they didn't want to break all the legitimate websites that rely on this behavior to this day.\n\nThis is why you need anti-csrf tokens to hand form POSTs. I think https://smagin.fyi/posts/cross-site-requests/ is a great summary on why we have both CSRF protections and CORS. It's mostly history. We wouldn't have done it this way from scratch. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43231411 also has some comments on the blog post.",

Do this at least 6 months to a year, and then start prepping for \"real interviews\" learn your algorithms, do leetcode, etc. You'll never be ready but as long as you have ok understanding of data structures and most common algorithms on those structures you'll be good.

Don't believe the promises startup will make and if you're either bored or tired of a low pay then jump ship to a bigger company, this time \"the bigger the better\" you want this second company to be crazy big, avoid big companies whose main focus isn't technology, i.e. prefer Uber instead of Lenovo, streaming at Disney rather than IT at Boeing. There you'll learn about big scale and other engineering practices, this is where you go from midlevel engineer to senior. Again be proactive, don't limit yourself to be a developer, you should also do the deployments, monitoring, become a generalist that goes deep. At least 3 years in a company like this will do. Don't fall in to the politics governing this big companies, you're there to learn, let them play their little games.\n\nAfter that the world is your oyster, you should be looking for companies that are surfing a generational wave, for example nowadays looking at Anthropic or OpenAI would be good, every ~10 years or so there's a big trend you should follow, personally I've found my sweetspot is remote companies of around 100 people, maybe 50 engineers, not everything depends on you but you still have impact on the future direction, no politics and no drama. \n\nAim to at least double the pay every-time you switch companies, and during interviews never reveal what did you get paid at the previous job, at some point it would be almost impossible but if you're good you might get lucky.\n\nGood luck!\n\n...or enroll in a bootcamp.",

Stick with one, and whenever you‚Äôre curious about something, dive into the documentation or use GPT for deeper understanding.  \n\nYou‚Äôll learn the most by building projects, it‚Äôs fun, gives you real-world experience, and helps you start building a portfolio.  Check out the FreeCodeCamp website it offers a great roadmap and exercises to learn full-stack development.  \n\nYou don‚Äôt need six months. If you‚Äôre really driven, you can build strong foundations in just one month.",

Within a program and interacting from program to program was very much not that easy. Even now, having understood and used more abstract concepts like multiple inheritance, the diamond problem, writing with and without OOP, and functional programming. \n\nBreaking down a task and putting it into code is still not easy for me. It really just takes time for the specific use case, it'll take a few iterations of design, or a completely new design in the end. It'll never be perfect, there is no perfect, but there's good enough, and good enough works until there's another good enough to compare it to. \n\nThis is especially true when writing a one-off program, you don't know how much time invested into each component is worth, so those programming design patterns are now weighed with your desire to get something to work. Deadlines make everything a mess. \n\nThe thing that helps is practice. Practice a lot. Practice is the best way to learn once you know how to write. There's always something new to learn so that can also feel depressing, you'll get to a point though like where I'm at that not knowing something won't bother you, because you know you can learn how to use it quickly, or you can also invest a couple hours understanding it completely. Most problems can be understood completely, don't try to look at the LZMA2 source code or code that is all sprawled out and think it'll be understood fast or completely.\n\nI've been doing this for a decade or so but my projects still seem amateur or chaotic, this is actually quite normal outside of a serious investment of time. Embrace chaos for the most part. I'm not going to report you to the FBI for having everything in a single file or reimplementing functionality, as long as you could do the opposite when you need to.",

Start with FCC and do the html/css/JS content until you finish it, get painfully bored, or feel like you're spinning your wheels. When you're ready to apply the js skills from FCC, start odin project for web development -- it'll show you how to use all of the syntax you've learned to build real things. Odin is particularly good because it's project-based and doesn't hold your hand, but for these reasons, it's good to have some syntax knowledge before getting too deep into it, IMO. It also teaches you common non-code skills that are necessary for building software in web context: version control (git/github), IDE/code editor setup, linux env setup (esp important if you're not on mac), basic terminal usage etc.\n\nThat's the path I took, and I don't think I'd be where I am today if I hadn't had FCC and Odin. I stayed 100% focused on js, and if you're going for web, I'd suggest you do the same -- it will speed things up if you focus on one language. And with node, you can write backend in js as well. The earlier you get used to typescript, as well, the better.\n\nBy the time I got semi-competent w/ React through Odin, I actually did a bootcamp. It sounds like the market is pretty bad for bootcampers these days, so dunno if I'd recommend it in 2025. In my case, I did the bootcamp after coding off and on for like 2 years though. So YMMV.

That is because anything outside the very narrowly set curriculum will be outside of their depth.",

The idea was that you could write that in any text-editor you like, and then \"compile\" the source code to a binary program that could be run on its own.\n\nI use the past tense, because nowadays the differences are a lot more blurred - you can write programs in languages like Python and JavaScript inside spreadsheets (Google Sheets and Excel supports both, as far as I'm aware), or inside the browser, or custom applications, or you can write code on its own, but then execute it with a runtime. And often this runtime contains a virtual machine, and it is all very complicated, but you usually don't need to know - you just write your program in an IDE and then run it directly in the IDE while working on it, until you are done, and can run it from anywhere on the computer.\n\nI recommend getting started with Python - follow a tutorial to help you set everything up, and get something working. Then later on you can always experiment further with writing and running the program in different ways!",

Private tool servers, private agents, refactoring and tightening up RBAC on APIs to accommodate more dynamic access patterns... those are things that there won't be one vendor for. Those are the things that take you from chat app party trick to wildly better UI and capabilities for business systems.\n\nAlso I'll note that just like the pre AI tech scene, the vast vast amount of positions will be not in innovation and R&D but in application development. Every shop will be building AI apps and especially extending and refactoring their existing systems to leverage AI, and the primary skill set will be building, not working at the bleeding edge of technology, but developing applications for it. UX is about to go through a bigger revolution than the smart phone. This change is going to make backends be designed differently. And platforms. There's about to be a ton of dev work, even with our shiny new tools that let us build feature X much faster than we could build it 5 years ago. We'll find ways to leverage lower experienced contributors, it just won't be endless frontend feature factories; demand for said features will go down with AI powered UX (not bolted on chat bot bs), and where they are needed, AI slop can handle that. I'm thinking they get pulled in for the middle 50% of a (feature flagged) project to get things back on track for the last AI slop push before a senior contributor takes over review and final tweaks.",

I work in web dev.\n\nIf I was starting out again, I‚Äôd do the bare minimum to understand how to debug on my own and learning how to Google and find things on Stack overflow.\n\nAfter becoming barely proficient enough to generally get through difficult tasks that approach, when needed, then I‚Äôd stop utilizing that approach for learning. I‚Äôd then open up several AI models with free chat samples of their higher-end models (usually in the form of free credits that reset daily), and then I‚Äôd start building tons of projects.\n\nThe AI assistance I‚Äôd use to help me understand things and identify unknown unknowns. You can‚Äôt just use it to build everything for you. Then you‚Äôre not a programmer, just a prompter. The goal is to use it faster than you‚Äôd have used Stack Overflow or Google to learn the same things.\n\nAfter building tons of projects, I‚Äôd get the experience taking a few live, such as web hosting, figuring out DNS, live database, live authentication, etc.\n\nAfter doing this, I‚Äôd research best security practices and go back through projects implementing them, and also trying to break them, to get a real-world understanding of how many insecure things you just built with AI‚Äôs help. AI isn‚Äôt thinking of security. You need to be. I‚Äôd download Burp suite, and learn the basics of using it. This is great for learning how to compromise your system and find vulnerabilities. You will find vulnerabilities. If you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs not because you don‚Äôt have any. It‚Äôs because you can‚Äôt find them.\n\nI myself am still getting better at the security aspect of things, so I can‚Äôt give you much more advice there, but that‚Äôs a starting point!\n\nThe thing is, I‚Äôm providing the value that many coworkers pre-AI were providing with much more years of experience than me. You need to use it to your advantage and speed up your learning to catch up and overtake many of them.\n\nYou also need to acknowledge that you are in a competitive field, and you are competing with many smart people. You need to acknowledge that if you want to grow faster than others, you need to do what 99% won‚Äôt. For me, that was working longer hours for experience. It was jumping into hard tasks for experience. It was pushing for more work and opportunity and legacy code work and bigger features and more bugs. I was willing to do the dirty work when it came up, and I was also always willing to listen to my coworkers whenever they had constructive feedback.\n\nSome of my coworkers have described me as ‚Äústarving‚Äù and ‚Äúhungry‚Äù to learn. I think there are a few who it scares, because of how fast I caught up to them.\n\nThe thing is, they‚Äôre working 9-5. I was willing to work 9-5, or 9-9, or 9-5 then midnight to 4, or over the weekend. It isn‚Äôt about the money. It‚Äôs about the experience. I don‚Äôt get paid more as a salaried individual. You need to acknowledge that it‚Äôs about the short-term suffering for the long-term investment.\n\nFinally, place yourself in positions where you‚Äôre not the smartest in the room, or the highest on the totem pole. If you‚Äôre the top of the food chain in an area, leave. It‚Äôs a waste of your time unless you‚Äôre building up experience by sharing to those with less experience. You need a bit of both. Sharing to others, and learning from others. Look for engineering meet-ups in your area. I was lucky to go to one with all staff and principal engineers, as the sole junior. Just being around them causes you to learn immensely. If you go to a meet up, and it‚Äôs primarily people in your own skill level, then leave.\n\nIn code, don‚Äôt get caught up in the little picture. Remember the big picture. Sometimes, things should really be left a little less perfect, or maybe not as clean, if they‚Äôre very leaf-node-like. Focus deeper on the root areas of the code base, that affect many things.\n\nIn the end, it also depends on your goals. My goal was (and is) to move up as quickly as possible, to make as much money as I can, as quickly as possible. My goal is to get higher quicker so that I can r/FIRE when I want to, where I want to, if I want to. I‚Äôm already in a position to coast FIRE. I am doing this for my freedom, and as a passion to program. You need to know why you‚Äôre doing this. Find your why. Remember your why. Be the ‚Äúhow‚Äù for your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù.",

Not to mention that maintaining a large Python codebase is quite hard, and poses many underlying challenges. It‚Äôs not all bad of course. You have Django, which is a powerhouse of a framework, making development of any backends very secure and reliable.\n\nGolang is very nice to use. Static typing makes it a lot easier to work with. Also, the performance is almost comparable to language like Rust and C++, especially considering how much easier it is to write good code in it. I personally quite like the community behind it. They seem to not like using too many dependencies, which alines with my personal preferences. Building a solid, thoroughly tested API in Go can be done exclusively using the standard library. It‚Äôs also very efficient. Small scale APIs and apps can run containerised on a few dozen megabytes of memory, which I imagine could be very good for freelancing, as it will lower  cloud bills for clients. Unfortunately there is no Django-styled batteries included framework in Go, which can make development of smaller projects harder.\n\nI‚Äôm also going to add one more suggestion - Java. Java and Spring Boot power huge systems worldwide reliably. Java has extremely rich tooling (I‚Äôd even say more so than Python). Also, it has been running literally on billions of devices for decades, making it pass the test of time with flying colours. Spring Boot is probably the best web framework to have ever used personally and is comparable and even more feature-full than Django. On top of that the language itself is quite easy and nice to work with.",

Same for index\\_of, also O(n) time.\n\nSo, completely disregarding the correctness, you have three calls to O(n) functions in your simpler approach, making the overall runtime far worse for large inputs. (EDIT for clarity: The inside of the loop changes from O(1) to O(n), so the entire algorithm changes from O(n) to O(n¬≤), because of the outer loop)\n\nIf you want to see it for yourself, choose a large integer (like 10\\_000\\_000) as your target, and only fill the array with random integers of less than half it's size. This way, your condition will never trigger, and you will need to go through the entire array. Now make the array of length 100 million, and watch the runtime difference.\n\n(This strongly depends on a good hash map / hash function for the values. This depends on your language. Make sure that the hash map works correctly, because if it doesn't it might also have O(n) runtime and you will not see a big difference XD)",

To be more specific, you have to completely iterate through the array in the time it takes the hashing to complete. That said, I've played around with a problem that fit this scenario, and the performance difference was negligible on an array with a max size of 20 elements in Rust. Unless you're aiming for sub-ms optimizations, and have a problem that is uniquely suited, hashmaps are pretty much always going to be faster.",

How many projects?\n\nThat's kind of a self-answering question. If you need to know what types projects, how complex, and how many, then your portfolio isn't strong enough to negate a degree. Building real things, that actually work, that people can use (might use, and are using) is what's important. Whether it be a frontend template, or a full application that helps you find shoes for the cheapest price, across every popular sales marketplace (let's say). And you don't feature a \"certain number of projects\", you feature \"your best work to date\", whatever it might be, usually 4 to 8 things (and then maybe show off the rest of your stuff outside of your \"featured projects\"). And, what's featured will depend on what you do, what you're building, and what types of roles you're applying for.\n\n>Does language matter?\n\nYes. You want to have a handle on whatever language(s) are being emphasized, for whatever you're applying for.",

The group interactions, project planning, running a meeting and actually have something come out of it.

What kind of job or project do you want to do?\n2. What skills or technologies are commonly used in that field?\n\nI'm not too confident when it comes to frameworks, so I won't go into that. But based on my personal experience, here are a few examples of different paths you could take. Still, I highly encourage you to do your own research and explore further:\n\n1. If you want to make video games, it's useful to learn C++ and C#, along with engines like Unreal Engine (C++) or Unity (C#). C++ is a lower-level language, which gives you more control over performance, but it's harder to learn. C# is widely used in Unity and also good for building desktop GUIs.\n2. If you'd like to make websites, you'll need HTML and CSS to structure and style web pages, and JavaScript to make them interactive.\n3. Lastly, if you want to work as a data scientist or in the AI field, Python is the go-to language. Learn libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and so on. SQL is also important for managing and querying databases.\n\nPython is considered a high-level language, meaning it's easier to write and read, but it's further from the hardware compared to languages like C or C++. This means you have less control over performance, and in some cases, Python can be slower when executing certain types of code. If you want to learn JavaScript know that there's a lot of memes because it works in a.. strange way üòÇ\n\nApart from this, you're surely making an excellent choice wanting to understand programming, I'm too \"at the beginning\", so this is everything I can give to you, hope I helped you brother!",

I absolutely don't want to make light of bullying but the fact that this is not the other way around is certainly a thing... \n\nTo be entirely honest the best advice I can really give you is, \"just allow yourself to get into it\". If you are just discovering it, the journey will take you somewhere. Lua is often used for modding games as I understand it, so you could maybe play around with some of that. There are frameworks for building web applications in Lua. You don't have to worry about it being \"basic\" for now, you are picking up the essential skills. \n\nMy personal 'prime directive' advice is simply, \"just pick something you would like to try to make and start trying to make it!\". When somebody crosses fields like this I always suggest mining their knowledge of their other field to see if there are any ideas you can think of that might be useful. It doesn't have to make you a billionaire, it doesn't have to even ever get used, it just needs to give you an idea to focus on, so you can use programming as a means to an end.... that's what you'll be expected to do if you work in the field and strangely it is also where you learn the most. It all happens while you are trying to figure out how to do something.",

If you work in an environment with actual windows, take the time to look away outside from time to time.  Probably at least once every 30 minutes to an hour try to just look out, as far across the horizon as you can, for 30-seconds or so. Helps refresh and refocus your eyes.\n\nAlso, definitely take breaks often. Even if it's just getting up to refill your water  or use the restroom. Getting. Up and walking for 1-2 minutes every so often does a lot to extend your stamina. On lunch breaks, try walking around  outside (if you have a park or walking path nearby then that's a great place, but even just around the block can do wonders). If you can walk somewhere for lunch instead of driven then try that as well.  Any excuse to move is a good excuse imo.\n\nBeyond that, You can try a standing desk (if you have the ability to change desks, that is). Or an under-desk bike/elliptical just to keep your legs moving.",

Websites like Squarespace offering building kits in which you can make the global layout without coding and then refine things via. added scripts and libraries.  \n2. WordPress  \n3. HTML + CSS, the default option for simple sites  \n4. JavaScript for interactivity  \n5. Python/PHP (or other languages) for server implementations\n\nThe \"correct\" choice really depends on what you plan to make and what you plan to use it for.\n\nThe long answer:  \n  \nHTML is technically not a full-fledged programming language, but more a tool to build the skeleton of the website. Basics you can mostly learn in a day/week. CSS is for everything style (fonts, colors, layouts, ...) and works as addition to HTML.  \n  \nFor real-time interactivity, you need JavaScript. There are variations, but JS is the only language supported by basically all browser, which is why it is the go-to programming language for this.\n\nIf you want your page to have the ability to save/access data, through a database or multi-user interactivity or such.. Then you generally need to have a programming language on the web server. PHP was most common for a long time, but nowadays you see a lot of people use Python instead.  \nYou can generally use any programming language you want on the server, it will effectively read data coming in from web pages, and produce web pages as output. It also deals with a file systems or databases.\n\nUnlike HTML and CSS, any programming language will take a lot of effort to master. So if you really want to build a web page that sits there and shows information, you'll be fine with HTML and CSS.\n\nEasy-Mode: HTML + CSS  \nMedium-Mode: add JavaScript  \nHard-Mode: add PHP or Python (or other...) for server based interactions and databases\n\nKind regards,  \nMr. Prototype and the Broken Pony Studios team  \n(I am just an indie game developer who made his companies website :D)",

But doing this in my early career has allowed me to learn so much more, and develop more intuition for these kind of things. Now I can think of broad problems that touch many systems and much more easily consider the broad impact of changes in one system. This sets me up nicely to do high level design spanning many systems, makes me helpful in XFN collaboration with other teams, and helps me a lot with debugging/incident response. So I'm slower to code but I'm building the skills to become a senior+ engineer. Whereas in most companies just being fast and good at coding takes you to mid level tops.\n\n\nNone of this matters if your company doesn't realize the value in that though.¬†",

Take a break, switch to different job if possible, who knows you could be a more valuable asset in your next company.",

My suggestion is always to find a **complete** tutorial on something like udemy for $10-$20 and use it. Make sure it's a Beginner to expert tutorial that covers all aspects of the technology. If it's something big like JavaScript as a whole or React as a whole or all of Python, it should be at least 20-30 hours long. Go through the tutorial with the teacher, WRITE everything in your own IDE, do not just watch or listen, write it out yourself, the more senses you use in learning, the more likely your brain will consider it important. Watching a video is alright. Watching a video and taking notes is better. Watching a video, taking notes and building the same functionality along side them (and getting it to work) is far better. Watching a video, taking notes and building the same functionality along side them and then teaching it to someone else is even better. If you have no one to teach it to, teach it to the wall, or a chair, or a rubber duck, or whatever. The key is you need to be able to explain what is happening, or you don't really know what is happening.\n\nOnce you're done doing the entire tutorial with the lecturer, if you feel up to it, start working on your own project. First create the repo with the technology boiler plate, don't know how? How did they do it in the tutorial? Then add some hardcoded text and things to the page. How? Check the tutorial. Then make the data dynamic and add a list of objects using a for loop, how? Check the tutorial. Then call an API, how? Check the tutorial. You get the picture.",

Helps a lot to visualize change. Just make a basic html with some containers and lorem text in them, get them all centered, and throw them around the page. Make yourself do weird stuff with it, container in container in container anything you can think of, will help with cards later on and understanding parent and children. The random transform stuff you will use when needed and just google, hover the same thing, and you'll just remember it from then on. Display switches and other stuff just come with projects, but you won't use long-term, dark mode you'll use later on. It's a lot, but look at a page and ask yourself how that is there or why does it looks like that and recreates it. A great site would be apple to clone with html and css. Also, when structuring, I always give each container a random ass background color, which visually helps understanding what's going on. Good luck, and you got this!",

You've mentioned you're doing free code camp which is good, but their editor is very barebones. I think learning \"the hard way\" like this is quite good but autocomplete/suggestions make getting the syntax right a lot easier.\n\nA few tips/useful sites:\n\n*  [MDM ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)\\- this should be the first place you look things up, its THE reference and is well written, easy to understand and has good examples \n* [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) \\- I've linked to the guides section, whilst there's some advanced stuff here their guides/cheat sheets for flexbox and, lengths and media queries are always useful\n* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/elements) \\- Firefox has similar, use the one you like. I've linked to the \"element\" section which helps answer the question \"why doesn't this thing do the thing I thought it should\". On free code camp when doing the test projects you can click the button at the top right to open the preview in a new window, this will mean the dev tools for that window don't show the code editors which can be confusing.\n* [BEM](https://getbem.com/naming/) \\- At some point you'll start building more complex things and have a convention for how to give things names consistently helps keep your CSS readable and reusable. There are other conventions but I like this one.\n* [CSS Variables/Why frameworks are good](https://coreframework.com/) \\- Free code camp introduces variables super late which can build bad habits. As a general rule you never want hard coded values in any code, anywhere. It makes code hard to read and hard to modify in the future. Defining things like font sizes, colour palettes, spacing and border radiuses upfront makes everything a lot easier down the line. I've linked the framework I use, it will generate you CSS variables for free but there are plenty of other options available. Avoid tailwind until you actually understand CSS, once you've got a good handle on it give it a spin.",

        "body": "Well, no, but also yes.\n\nCSS isn't confusing at all, it is, especially with changes made the last three-five years, a very well structured language to express how you'd like the design and layout of your HTML-document to look.\n\nHowever, most programmers suck at visual design, at understanding what looks good, what the rules are, what things are called, and how to plan or even talk about the design of a document. They often prefer some pre-baked incantations that they can just throw at the page, so it will look like every other page out there. Which is probably why Bootstrap became so popular in the first place, and why Tailwind is so popular now.\n\nCSS is very, very, very different from HTML and JavaScript - HTML is a structure, it is easy to see if one element is before, after, inside or outside another. And JavaScript mostly is a list of lines, all being executed one after another, so that's also pretty easy to understand.  \nBut in CSS there isn't really any structure, just a bunch of rules that more or less all apply at the same time.\n\nSome parts of CSS has to do the the individual elements, how they look, how much space they take up, or where they are in relation to other elements. Other parts of CSS has to do with the layout, how an element layouts other elements inside of it. Yet other parts of CSS has to do with how an element is layouted by the parent. And you don't really write the rules, you just set some values on some properties that is used by some algorithms. So it is a bit like programming where you can only change the values of variables - difficult.\n\nI think that this recent video from Kevin Powell: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ) gives a good introduction to understanding how to understand CSS :)",

But also, plenty of people write awful documentation. They've spent too much time thinking too deeply about the problem they're solving and they neglect to simplify it for the reader, and the documentation is at least as much about bragging about their accomplishments or geeking or about their model train as it is helping people.

        "body": "\"Documentation\" is a pretty general term and typically falls into a number of sub-categories with different use cases:\n\n* API documentation: what classes/methods/functions exist, what arguments they take and what they return. This is useful a reference for people who *already know* how to use the library in question and need a reminder. Also a nice way, once you know how to use the library generally, to fully explore all the things it can do. e.g. what methods exist on \\`class Router\\`\n* Guides: Explore a single topic in *depth* \"How to route incoming requests in Framework X\". Good for seeing how classes/methods/functions can be used to solve real world problems in a single focused domain. E.g. [https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)\n* Tutorials: Explore a set of related topics in a library (perhaps in combination with other libraries that commonly go together) in *breadth* to accomplish some real world task. This is what most blog articles and video how-tos are going to be. E.g. [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjItgYqIzJ9WGy9WMf-44DXHB\\_7aWwJMc](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjItgYqIzJ9WGy9WMf-44DXHB_7aWwJMc)\n* Books: Explore a set of related topics in a library (perhaps in combination with other libraries that commonly go together) in *breadth and depth* to accomplish some real world tasks. [https://pragprog.com/titles/rails7/agile-web-development-with-rails-7/](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails7/agile-web-development-with-rails-7/)\n\n  \nKnowing which type of documentation best matches your current question and skill level is important!\n\nAs tempting as it is to accelerate towards a single answer using AI for a work task, I would encourage any beginner in a topic to avoid doing this. Learning, and indeed authoring, code is considerably more than answering a question or completing a task. As you read API docs for one method, you stumble upon another that might better solve your problem. When researching \"how do I route with an optional parameter\" you also learn a bit about how the library processes routes in order; a month later a \"weird routing bug\" has an obvious and simple solution to you (\"this route just needs to be higher precedence\").\n\nTo write new code you need to read existing code, sometimes code right where you're working, sometimes code many hops away in a callstack. The more you read, the more you slowly build up valuable context about the code in totality, the better your future code comes.\n\nThe acceptance criteria for AI tools in their current form is the same as an incredibly eager intern or early career professional: \"Well, *it works\".* A large application that is an accumulation of tasks completed to a \"well, it works\" level becomes increasingly difficult to understand and change. This can happen *incredibly* quickly.",

Buy Claude and vibe code your way through the project ensuring you understand everything. Your project should  have at least 6 technologies going on with concurrency.

Competitions create a small number of winners and a large number of losers. Read this sub for a week and you‚Äôll come to understand that lots of beginning programmers already feel that they‚Äôre not smart enough to ever really succeed.\n\nCompetition pits people against each other. I get that some people enjoy testing themselves that way, and that‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs not for everyone. What particular skills do you think competition will teach or sharpen? Time management? Planning and decision making? Task prioritization? Whatever they are, why can‚Äôt you teach those skills some other way?\n\nIn the real world, programming is much more about collaboration and teamwork than competition. The best programmers teach and inspire the people around them, and that helps them improve too. People spend time answering questions on sites like StackOverflow because helping others solve problems is a great way to learn. Is there a way that you can use collaboration to help your students improve? Maybe have the stronger students coach the weaker ones?",

You can't download as a PDF/epub from the site, but you can download the books to read within the O'Reilly app on Android and iOS. There are supposedly some chrome extensions and tools which allow you to download the books as PDFs to bypass the rights restrictions, but to be honest if you're going to do that anyway, you might just consider downloading the books from illegitimate sources, as pretty much all the books are available from the usual pirated ebook places. That's a moral decision on your part - subscribing to O'Reilly means at least the authors are getting, I assume, a cut of the subscription fee if the books are accessed.",

You could start here: [https://programming-25.mooc.fi/part-1](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/part-1) \\- then in a few weeks when you're comfortable with basics, follow a pygame tutorial.\n\nEither way, I think a reasonable expectation might be that if you start to learn programming today, it might be a month or two of learning before you'd be ready to try building something like this.

The issue arises when I have to build join statements in Python using SQL Alchemy since a single table doesn't have all the data it needs to be pulled from multiple tables. But due to three naming conventions I have to go through each and every one of them just to figure out what is the name here. To further add headache the relationship are many to many. I am not even sure if this helps but there are many columns that come from API but even there the naming conventions are different. Here's an example country_id is the column name in table1 and I need table2 to join at country_id because that's where the weather report comes from but the column is called weather_ids_country I thought this was a mistake so I asked the team they are like no this is correct. It means the same thing. I am like fine. Now everything is in integer so I need the values which comes from API on that it is called currency_code_id it means the same thing. Now if this was present in one column I would have brute force this connection but it is present everywhere.",

That is, I'd extract the knowledge from the LLM in a programmatically useful way instead of trying to extract an algorithm from the LLM that can scrape the data successfully from so many different sources.\n\nYou're probably better off attempting to get a common format out of the LLM directly but in the off-chance you're interested, I've actually written something that can do this sort of thing, though I don't know if it would work well in your case or not or if you'd be able to leverage it. If you want to try it together I would be happy to hop on a call and see if I can help you integrate it into your solution. Always nice to have a shot at adoption for one of my projects! It's here if you're curious: [https://github.com/foobara/llm-backed-command](https://github.com/foobara/llm-backed-command) and I've also built a no-code solution for creating these types of commands.

I've been in the industry for a little over ten years. I'm not the best software developer. I mess with scripts and things go VROOOM! Don't ask me how it works.\n\nPlease note, I'm not telling you to bypass college. A formal education is a good thing. I definitely would have benefited from a formal CS education.\n\nHowever you may want to consider a few things.\n\nProgramming is so incredibly saturated. We have people coming from all points on the globe and they get hired even when they don't speak English.\n\nProgramming by itself will get you doing repetitive grunt work. If you're like me, you envision yourself breathing life into creative projects. This is not what the majority of consumers use their hardware for. Banks will have you programming in nothing but PySpark. You'll be doing PySpark for years. Is it stable? Yes. Is it boring and repetitive? Absolutely.\n\nIf you are able to pair your ability to program with another discipline/skill then you can have valuable insights that others without your knowledge won't have.\n\nDon't shy away from personal projects. They're a better learning experience than tutorials.",

In other words, if you represent their interactions as sets (of IDs), you want the intersection of those sets.\n\nI don't know of any fancy general-purpose algorithm that can do this better than the simple, brute-force approach of just computing the intersection on the fly. Precomputing the intersections is not a good idea because if you have N users, there are O(N^(2)) possible pairs, and most of those pairs will never be queried.\n\nBeyond that, you just have to estimate/benchmark the performance and optimize for your particular situation. Here's a very hand-wavy and totally hypothetical estimate:\n\n* Let's say that for future-proofing, each \"interaction\" (the ID of a post or whatever) can be represented as a 64-bit integer, occupying 8 bytes of space.\n* Assume that a typical user does 1000 interactions per day, and has a 10-year activity history on the site (if your site is very successful). So you can store a user's entire history in 1000 x 365 x 10 x 8 bytes, or about 30MB. Maybe this compresses down to 10MB or so.\n* With an SSD that has a sequential read throughput of maybe  500MB/sec, you can read 10MB in 20 milliseconds. Double that for two users.\n* Actually finding the intersection between two sorted lists of integers can be done easily in linear time. So the CPU is unlikely to be a bottleneck.\n* If one request fully utilizes the SSD for 40ms, then you can handle 25 \"common interaction\" queries per second. If you need to do more than that, you can add more read-only replicas of the same data.\n* Don't forget to account for the disk utilization associated with updating the user histories when new interactions happen. This depends on your requirements, e.g. do the query results need to be perfectly up to date with the latest interactions, or is it OK to perform batch updates once an hour, or once a day?\n* Maybe you want to find the top 10 most *recent* interactions in common. In that case, choose your 64-bit IDs so that they are (exactly or approximately) increasing in timestamp order. Then if the intersection has a million IDs in common, you don't have to fetch a million rows from the DB. You just sort the integer IDs themselves (very cheap since they're already in memory) and then only fetch the largest 10.",

It's not gonna happen everywhere, but a lot of places are trashing your resume and moving on- it's not worth their time to look in detail at every candidate who claims to be good with no degree. 4 years of self study with projects is not more valuable than 4 years of formal study with projects, which is what a degree indicates you have.

I always got decent review scores when I questioned the system and my superiors (because bad reviews are usually scrutinized by HR and the higher ups to avoid liability, and your boss doesn't want them to read a review where you pointed out what a moron (s)he is)",

People in more junior roles do not get treated this way, generally. I'm able to do this because I can effectively delegate my work. People in junior to mid roles aren't delegating shit. \n\nAnd senior roles are being treated as the new mid, with companies hoping to hire two or three cooks in the kitchen. Honestly, it's not a bad strategy. It's a hell of a lot better than trying to throw more engineers at an issue to solve it faster. That was only ever annoying. \n\nThe field is oversaturated because a bunch of universities for some reason think they can promise people jobs after they graduate. As if knowing what you're doing has anything to do with who's hiring. \n\nWhy would you want to enter this industry from academia? There's no security. There are no pensions. Sometimes there is equity, but only with extreme risk. This industry favors the risk taking autodidact, and those very high salaries are punctuated with sometimes months long breaks in employment.\n\nThis is not a traditional field, and people are in for a rude ass awakening. If you want more stability, go to industrial control systems, defense, or embedded. All of those people need very qualified and stable people.",

A few months at a company isn't worth anything, and can only look bad or neutral. More often it's the latter, but in your case it was unfortunately the former.\n\nBeing unemployed also doesn't look great, obviously, but in this market it's easier to explain away as there's a lot of unemployed people currently, which makes it a more typical conversation to be having.\n\nI don't think you need to remove your current company from your resume, but you should not state salary as a reason for leaving. Say it's a culture fit problem, or the team process doesn't work for you, or something else that you couldn't have known when you signed the offer. You knew the salary going in, and you don't like it. That's a red flag for an early stage startup where retention is important. You look like a job hopper who leaves when a new shiny toy shows up.\n\nYou used to work at FAANG, so they're already worried they can't keep up with your salary needs.

The recruiters job is to present candidates that have responded and they think would be good fits to the hiring manager. Once presented, the hiring manager made the decision to not interview you.\n\nHappens all the time, for lots of reasons. It's just not always a good fit from the hiring manager's perspective, even if the recruiter thinks it would be. I've experienced it plenty of times.\n\n>What do they expect me to do, respectfully decline the phone call because I just started a new role?\n\nHonestly, from the hiring manager's perspective.... yes. Exactly that. You're fielding calls for new jobs, when you've *just* started a job a few months ago. While the recruiter might've thought that was fine, the hiring manager obviously did not. Usually when you start a new job, you at least give it a fair shot. I'm not taking recruiter calls, or looking at job boards, when I've just started a new job.\n\nI take longer to decide if I actually like a new shirt I bought or not than you've given your current job.\n\n>What‚Äôs the alternative? Don‚Äôt mention I just started a new role and what, claim I‚Äôm still at my old company? Or claim that I‚Äôm unemployed?\n\nSure, you can do that. If you ever find yourself in a position where you're job searching when you've only been at your current company for a couple months... leaving that off your resume and never mentioning it would save you a lot of trouble. Don't lie about being at your old company, otherwise the dates on the background check won't line up, but you can totally say you left your other company because it wasn't a good fit and have been job searching since.

        "body": "I think it's important to have a diversified interview prep.\n\nLeetcode is a *part* of it, but you also need to be prepared for more general questions. Honestly leetcode is only maybe 20% of the prep I do when I decide to job hop. Most of my time goes towards behavioral prep and STAR scenarios, but a decent chunk of time goes towards very general technical prep. Language-specific terms/concepts, differences between versions if it's relevant (Java 6 vs Java 8 for example), re-reviewing data structures, SOLID, the 4 fundamental OOP concepts, design patterns, etc.\n\nBasically a review of all the fundamentals that are things we don't consciously think of during our day to day, but we're doing subconsciously. The exact kinda stuff pop-quiz style interviews tend to poke at.\n\nFor example, if I asked you what the L stands for in SOLID, and explain it, could you do that right now? I know I couldn't. But when I'm looking for a job, you bet your ass I could rattle off any of those letters from memory and explain them. I *have* absolutely been asked about SOLID/OOP before. I remember one interviewer off-handedly asked me \"What's your favorite design pattern?\". I'm not a theory guy really, so I'm not really thinking about the textbook names and definitions of design patterns day to day.... but I had prepped on design patterns, so I was able to give a great answer that cultivated a good discussion. My answer wasn't \"Builder... because it's the only one I remember\". I got that job.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff in between a pure leetcode interview and a 2 hour pop-quiz session, most interviews may settle at a natural blend of the 2 types of questions. But you should absolutely still expect to be asked questions about the basics and fundamentals. Even an hour of prep should make those kinds of questions trivial for you to answer.",

Some companies will give you homework before even speaking to anyone (don't do those you shouldn't have to work for free), pass a minimum of 4 interview rounds, and so on and so forth. \n\nIf it is honestly something you think is worth putting up with and is passionate about then yah continue with this field. Otherwise maybe it's time to pivot. There are jobs out there that require any type of degree to get started. Definitely not going to pay as much as a dev job, but those salaries are also decreasing.\n\nSoftware development is in a strange category, it's treated as a STEM job but also something similar to art. It is now expected to be working on personal projects outside of work like how art is, but also is insanely technical and time consuming. I don't think many other STEM fields are like this. I don't think chemists are expected to be mixing chemicals in their basement over the weekend, but we are expected to be constantly working on some sort of side project all the time. It's honestly exhausting to keep up with.",

They're not a fit for the role, they probably know this, but getting as many intros as you can is the name of the game. I totally get it, no beef here.\n\nFor you this means: if you see a role where your skills line up, GOOD RESUMES STAND OUT, so invest time in your resume and then invest more time in it.\n\n2. Instant resume killers\n\nYour resume doesn't tell me what you've been doing the last few years! I know it sounds silly but I've seen some resumes that talk really in detail about tools and languages, and don't talk about... what projects you worked on and how they mattered in the big picture, who used your work, who you collaborated with to make things happen, what defects you saw and what you improved and how you did that.\n\nIf all you talk about is having taken tickets and turn them to code with lots of languages and tools, I can only assume you're best suited for a role that needs someone to specialise in taking tickets and turning them into code.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is, someone who's interested in joining a team, who wants to learn and help others learn, who wants to improve things, and to build stuff that works which they're proud of. So.... Write your resumes to show me these: make each bullet show some mix of how you've worked with lots of types of people, learned from and mentored them, made small improvements, worked on projects, all while you did the bigger items you want to highlight.\n\nIllustrating these will impress me more than a contextless \"Shipped project megazorb in java 21, made a billion\"\n\n3. Interview stuff\n\nI'm always rooting for the candidate. I am also always thinking of my team and thinking, \"how will this person improve us\". Keep that in mind when I'm forced to ask HR question \"tell me a time contrived event happened\".  Beyond that, biggest pointers I'd give are\n\n\\- I pass plenty of people who struggle in technical qualifiers\n\nIf you're struggling, don't panic, but don't try to hide it either. The aim of the interview is: get to know what we'll both be like to work with. If you feel like a question or task is about to sink you, this is now a chance to show me how you deal with what seems like a really big problem. We'll have plenty in the role, I'm certain you've seen plenty before, so show me what you can do.\n\n\\- Never criticise past employers/colleagues. Just don't go there. Even if you've heard that rule and still think \"well this is close to criticism  but I'm phrasing it objectively so its ok\", still don't. I don't know why, but people do it a lot. I don't know you or those people and I have know way of knowing if what you're saying is fair or not. Just flip everything to \"I'm looking for $goodthing\" and don't say \"past employer had $badthing\". We can lament bad jobs when you're hired\n\n\\- Don't lie. I'm not always going to catch it, but when I do, it's just a straight decline. If you don't have a great example of \"tell me a time X happened\", don't make one up, just say: \"I've never had to deal with that exactly, as stated, but I have had to do Y or Z\". These questions are almost always about, how did you learn from bad thing, how did you get around obstacle. If you just make something up there's nothing real and human there and it does show through. I'd much rather you told me a sort of similar thing you did have to deal with rather than make something up\n\nBit of a stream of consciousness there sorry about that.

Most of the applicants were filtered out by our corporate recruiter for not having the required experience on their resume, but one was rejected at the recruiter level for being too arrogant. I have no idea what the applicant did to annoy the recruiter, since I wasn't a part of that interview. Another was rejected by the recruiter because they weren't good at communicating back to the recruiter within a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThere were a lot of good applicants, and many of them would have no doubt been great hires. We.sent out a programming project to our applicants which had a \"Bonus points for...\" section. A few applicants did the bare minimum,. but the person I hired did well on the test and also completed the \"bonus points\" section. The person was also honest with their weaknesses, which was a plus for us.\n\nThere is definitely an advantage in being one of the first applicants.  Our company has a policy of not having any more than three candidates in the interview process at any given time, so we might have a fantastic candidate who won't be given a chance until we've got less than three people in the interview process.",

        "body": ">I'll do junior stuff and take low end salaries\n\nAnd companies won't believe you.\n\nOne of the most important parts of recruiting is retention. If a company doesn't think they can retain you, they're not going to hire you.\n\nLots of things can make a company think they can't retain you. For example, if you blurt out your salary expectation are $200k, but the company is only able to offer $80k, they're not going to even bother extending the offer. Even if you say \"Oh, actually, I'm totally willing to accept $80k!\", they're not going to bother. You already showed your hand. They know you want $200k, and they know even though you'll accept their offer of $80k, because $200k was your expectation you're going to continue job searching and leave them the moment you get an offer that's more aligned with your expectations.\n\nAnother example, if you've gotten a PhD and are highly specialized in a niche area of the industry, and the company you're talking to is just hiring for a basic CRUD role... they know you'll be impossible to retain. You got a PhD, you're highly specialized. Even if you say to the company \"I'll be totally happy in your role\", they know it's BS. They know you'll be out the door the second you get an offer that's relevant to your PhD.\n\nThat same idea applies to you. You have 10 YOE. You can claim you'll be happy with junior roles, and low end salaries, but companies know that's total BS and you'll quit the moment you get a Senior role with a Senior salary lined up. Even if it's the truth, from the company's perspective, they're not going to believe it for a second, and you'll fall into the \"impossible to retain\" category. No company will hire someone they don't think they can retain.\n\nAll of that said, you can absolutely be a 10+ YOE dev and be part of the team, and code regularly. Most of us do. A Senior SWE is still an IC. A Staff SWE, and a Principal SWE, are still IC's. They still code every day, they're still an active contributing member of the engineering team, their responsibilities just get zoomed out a bit. Instead of looking at things at the single-Jira-ticket level, they might be thinking at the epic-level, or the quarterly-deliverables-level, or the company-wide-architecture-level. You're still extremely technical, you're not a manager. Plenty of people stay an IC their entire career, and you can too.\n\nBut your problem is you're trying to stay on the IC-route, but aren't actually evolving beyond a junior/mid-level in terms of skills/contribution. So that makes you a very, very, very expensive developer that doesn't deliver on their price tag. And because of the aforementioned issue, companies aren't just going to continue paying you junior level salaries when you're carrying with you 10+ YOE.\n\nYou need to dive into the deep end, and apply for Senior+ level roles. If you can convince a company you're ready for that role, even if you don't feel like you are, that's how you'll set yourself up for the next 20 years of your career. If you don't do that, you'll find yourself struggling a lot, and you'll claim \"age-ism\", but it's very much about your career path, not about your age.",

One is that mapping tools to conceptual components is generally more flexible than the other way around (and at a number of places will look better, but know your audience); knowing the reasonable scope of what tools can do is often more useful than detailed specifics, role requirements not withstanding. The other is that at some of these levels, you do have to build bespoke tooling.\n\nOf course, it's also the case that when you usually only have \"a bunch of Linux machines, an SSH session, and some certs\" (as the joke in the interview went, I think), you spend less time on keeping up with general tooling that you can't use anyway.\n\n>I'm curious why he's calling this out when pointing out a need for availability, given that CRDB's [FAQ](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/frequently-asked-questions#how-is-cockroachdb-both-highly-available-and-strongly-consistent) points out that they're explicitly strongly consistent. \n\nI don't think the post is quite summarizing right here.

It was written by a lot of people who have vested interest in AI hype staying as high as possible. This paper just happens to come out when we are seeing chatgpt fail to release 5.0 and revising what it's supposed to accomplish down harder than the old 5g definitions. It is becoming more apparent that AI is being used as a marketing tactic to do layoffs and still raise stock prices. AI hype is almost single handedly floating the stock market. The AI 2027 paper was also spread ad nauseam by other people who have even More vested interest in the hype train staying rolling than the authors themselves. Not that I really care what Bill Gates says in a press release. It's not like he is transparently sharing insight or anything, it is also PR and marketing.\n\nI'm sure I'll catch plenty of downvotes over it, but you asked where we saw this going ourselves. Personally, I'm of the mind that AI is already showing fundamental issues that more compute won't solve, and there will be a breaking point that VC money stops fueling AI research companies. The public gets compute time on a supercomputer for a Google search summary now. That is not a reasonable business plan, they make no money doing that for you. Why do it? Stock. Google can't be the only giant left behind. Once investment money isn't forcing the business plan to work it'd probably enshitify. Think about how good and revolutionary Uber/DoorDash/AirBnB were when they first came out, and how those disruptor business evolved over time into nickel and dime hell holes. For all of those, we went from the old inconvenient model that had full time employees, to now the gig economy with no benefits and lower wages. We disrupted those markets so good. \n\nI'm well aware that I would be considered an AI pessimist, but it boggles my mind at how uncritically everyone is accepting a home brew board game research paper saying we hit singularity in 18 months. It feels like there is no space for caution or reasoning now that every tech illiterate middle manager thinks it's a freaking panacea for unlimited profit margin",

So that's where we're seeing most of the hype and movement right now. It's not really what the market needs but since we can't trust AI for much else, code generation becomes the focus. It doesn't hurt that good developers are expensive and there is potentially trillions in value if they can figure out a fully capable AI developer.",

        "body": "tl:dr: I'm a full stack dev who is about to get laid off. I've worked at one company for 7 years, and that's the extent of my industry experience. Assuming work is going to be scarce, what other options are out there that i could look into with minimal or no need for additional training? Does that even exist? Trying to be realistic and proactive.¬†\n\n\nSummary: I work on a team of developers for an enterprise company with a suite of proprietary web apps. All .NET/angular & nosql cloud architecture. I was promoted out of QA into development, but have not been given opportunity to progress, or mentorship, so I've had to learn everything on my own through hard won experience and the help of online coding communities. I only recently started using AI tools since I felt early on that it would limit my learning rather than improve it (honestly they only became strong enough to really help significantly in the last two years, anyway. I don't tend to work on stuff that an AI agent from 2022 could reproduce without errors or structural issues).¬†\n\nI believe I may be about to be laid off, so I'm looking for advice on how to continue pursuing a career as a developer (aide from just trying to apply everywhere i can, obviously) - or, what adjacent options i could pivot into given I only have an Associates degree.\n\n\nThe whole bloody story: I've been a junior web developer for 3 years. Before that I did two years as a QA Analyst and one year of help desk before that. All at this same company.¬†\n\n\nThe first year I spent as a developer, I spent a lot of time online doing courses like Pluralsite, MS Learn, OSSU, etc, so I was learning, but in my day-to-day I wasn't being allowed to work on modern infrastructure the rest of the team was working on. Instead, I was made responsible for maintaining a 20 year old piece of software primarily operating on old mvc and web forms. This was mainly to free up the other developers (who are all seniors) to work on the \"important\" projects. So I was spending 8 hours a day on bad examples and barely-functional software, while on my own time trying to learn javascript, .net, c#, angular, react, my sql, rxjs, etc. I have pretty severe ADHD that I'm on medication for... that didn't go well. They knew.¬†\n\n\nI made a lot of mistakes, because it was difficult to apply what I was learning to what I was working on at work. When asked to create a proof of concept in modern architecture or refactor some complex logic, I would constantly be getting confused by outdated coding patterns and structural flaws vs newer stuff like onion and so on. I brought up multiple times that this was a problem and that it was impossible for me to learn anything this way with my disability, and was ignored. It was truly a \"sink or swim\" mentality.¬†\n\n\nEventually, I was taken off of development because they weren't seeing the improvement they wanted, and given qa tasks. For an entire year, I was not allowed to work on code and was entirely support. My title did not change.¬†\n\n\nThey moved me back into dev in 2024 as a \"last chance.\" At first this went really well. People were shocked to see how much progress I'd made, because I WAS NOT IDLE during the intervening time. I'd still been studying and coding in my spare time while I was working on QA.¬†\n\n\nI work for a company that has a suite of proprietary web apps used to track their assets, and most development is done in-house. I just helped them release a modern replacement for that 20 y/o flagship product, and being that it was just released, it has a lot of user stories coming in. As you might expect.¬†\n\n\nSeveral other devs recently left, and all of their defects and user stories were reassigned to me. Because I'm taking the heat for all of these story points, and my performance is being called into question, I've been told-without-words that if I don't improve I'm going to be terminated. The company is young and scrappy, and they \"aren't interested in being a school\". I'm completely overloaded, sometimes literally working 80hrs a week just to keep up with the pace of seniors who have 20+ years of experience, and to be honest it's really starting to affect my health. Based on the way my coworkers are talking about and around me, I feel like it's going to happen soon (possibly this week).\n\n\nThis company is hugely toxic (its one of those \"corporate family\" environments), and during this entire process I have never received a significant raise, so my compensation is still on par with a tester. I need to leave. I've needed to leave. But the job market is in the toilet due to the seemingly endless layoffs in our sector over the last years. With recent news from Microsoft, that doesn't seem likely to change.¬†\n\n\nFor what is worth: i do really enjoy the work. And my coworkers. But I'm absolutely killing myself over it. I routinely have anxiety attacks.¬†\n\n\nThe area i live in is expensive, and I'm not making it to payday as it is. In this economy, I'm looking for any advice on either how to continue pursuing a career in development... or how to pivot into something adjacent. I'm happy to move literally anywhere as we don't particularly like the northeast anyway.¬†\n\n\nTo be clear: I'm quite proud of where I'm at now, as far as my capability compared to where I started. I routinely work on tasks that would be out of question for a green junior and these days my code is much more structured and predictable. I have done a huge amount of skill acquisition in the last 3 years and I'm very confident in my abilities (with or without AI). My biggest detractor is my education status which stopped at Associates degree due to health and family issues.¬†\n\n\nThanks for reading. Any advice is appreciated. Good luck out there.",

Most of the time the code does feel trivial to me.\n\nI've been programming so long that I can't even help new programmers all that much. I can mentor an eager junior or mid level, but my friend who wants to pick up programming and career switch I'm just so far removed from how I had to learn when I was 12 that I can't really empathize and my explanations would probably do more harm than good because I operate at a much higher level by default.",

Don't think you should only work for pure tech companies. All sorts of companies hire developers. \n\nYou have a gap since your graduation. It may make sense to take your graduation date off your resume. It's your call. \n\nBesides applying, studying a mix of LeetCode and practical skills. What do I mean by practical skills? Things you'd be doing on the job.\n\n* Do you understand how databases work? How familiar are you with SQL?\n* NoSQL?\n* Any cloud experience?\n* How good are your front-end vs back-end skills? Do you only know a language like PHP, or do you know languages that are more widely in use in corporate settings like Java, Python, JavaScript, React? \n* Can you build a basic CRUD app that uses REST API endpoints?\n* Are you familiar with Git? CI/CD pipelines?\n\nThose are a few things to get you started. I worked as a contractor at a large financial institution for a while. They were trying to fill some roles with people who graduated from a boot camp. 5/6 candidates could not answer extremely basic questions. I know everyone needs to live, but one guy said he had been driving Uber for a few months, and he seemed to have forgotten everything. The one person who was stronger ended up getting another offer elsewhere. \n\nWhile LeetCode has gotten more popular, there are still companies that don't use it. A challenge is finding a balance of what to study, etc. Some recruiters will tell you what their interview process is like, and others will not. A lot of people on this sub think that applying with what is effectively the same resume over and over will yield different results. Some people get lucky, but you should be trying to improve while you're looking. Otherwise, you're just someone who graduated and couldn't find a job. There are people with plenty of work experience who still don't know anything about cloud or NoSQL for example. There are tools and resources out there to become a stronger developer. It's been years since I graduated, but there's a lot of stuff that school doesn't teach you. \n\nOne other thing, take any comments from the internet with a grain of salt. Looking through these comments, there's almost nothing of value in there. Remember the joke about most of this sub being unemployed students. Terrible advice gets shared here all the time.\n\nThe last thing is try not to get too discouraged. The market is rough, and finding a job when you don't have one is always harder.",

(Not that you mentioned doing this just preemptively mentioning). \n\nKeep your head up 2 months is nothing even during good times.

Once you're working there, they may throw you on a project where you don't have experience with the stack, but you're already being paid by that point. Someone I know who worked in the FAANG space said that language-specific experience seemed really bizarre to him. We can argue about what's fair and what makes sense, but it's ultimately the company's decision of how they want to evaluate candidates.\n\nPart of being more selective is because of the market. They can afford to be. A few years ago, the bar dropped quite a bit. There's also some argument for practical experience. Yes, you can have great fundamentals, but what about someone with great fundamentals and relevant experience? There's a strong chance that there are plenty of people who can pick things up and be successful, but they're just trying to have more of a \"sure thing.\"\n\nHere's another question. If you don't have Java on your resume, and it was a requirement, why would they even set up a call with you? \n\nIt's a very flawed system.",

Writing may be a good stepping stone to practice output without the time pressure of speaking. r/WriteStreakEN will give you daily corrections. You could even note in your posts that you want corrections that elevate your vocabulary.\n\nAlso, if you have flash cards, work them in the ‚ÄúI need to produce English‚Äù direction. If you don‚Äôt have flash cards, maybe get started with some. I had 5000 words in my Spanish study list back when I was studying.\n\nAlso: read. A LOT. Reading is huge for increasing a person‚Äôs vocabulary. Since English pronunciation and orthography are only loosely related, and we‚Äôre talking about learning new words, reading along to an audiobook may be wise to ensure you pick up the correct pronunciations.\n\nFor specifically-tech stuff, watching conference talks might not be a bad idea; you can learn a lot of domain-specific vocabulary that way, and there are a ton on YouTube.\n\nRegarding filler words: spend at least one hour a week with a tutor doing conversation practice. If you can do an hour twice a week, even better. This is to get you practicing with the time pressure. \n\nAs your vocabulary and production under time pressure improve, you‚Äôll spend less time searching for words and trying to hide it with filler words. But also: are you using English filler words/sounds/phrases or ones from your first language? If first language, switch to English fillers. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a really interesting question because well, you know, the thing is, when you consider all aspects of that topic‚Ä¶‚Äù is a nice long string of words that give you time to actually think of your answer without it just being ‚Äúuhhhhh‚Äù or worse, a non-English filler like ‚Äúeeehmmmmmm.‚Äù\n\nRegarding pronunciation: record yourself repeating after something you‚Äôve just heard. Maybe you watch a technical video and pause and repeat back a sentence. Then play back the original and yourself and compare. You can do a fair bit of accent training this way. You can also hire tutors who specifically do accent coaching. \n\nIf your native language has far fewer vowels than English (for example, Spanish has 5, and Italian has 7), then you will want to learn some new ones. The two Italian has that Spanish doesn‚Äôt (open o and open e) are common in English, but English also has an open i, where the tongue is placed midway between Spanish‚Äôs i and e, and the sound in ‚Äúput‚Äù which is midway between o and u.",

And this is one class without much complexity. They are a long way from being let loose on our 10 million line codebase of bespoke classes. \n\nI was looking at one of my kids homework assignments the other day as she could not figure it out. I started with LLMs but they could not do C allocation and deallocation. Only because the assignment used an int\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* for an array of ints, instead o int\\*. It was off by one on every function, because it does not understand anything and is just predicting the next token which breaks down when something goofy is asked for like in the assignment. \n\nI only find AI useful for small well defined pieces of code. What would have taken an hour to find on the web and then tweak for my use case, can now be done in a few minutes. It is great for that sort of thing. But you better understand the code it gives you and be able to debug/refactor/modify it.  \n\nIn the future there could be breakthroughs that get us AGI and then it is game over.

The key is talking through your thought process out loud: start with requirements gathering, estimate scale, design the basic components, then discuss how you'd handle bottlenecks.\n\nYou can get interview-ready in about 2-3 weeks if you dedicate 2-3 hours daily. Watch YouTube videos from channels like Gaurav Sen or System Design Interview, but spend most of your time actually practicing mock interviews out loud. The biggest mistake people make is studying passively - you need to practice articulating your designs and defending your choices. Don't aim for perfection; aim for clear communication and logical reasoning. Interviewers care more about how you think through problems than whether you know the exact details of how Netflix's CDN works.\n\nI'm on the team that built Interviews Chat, and our prep module can help you practice system design questions with AI feedback based on real job descriptions, which might be useful for getting comfortable with the format and improving your explanations.",

Learn foundational stuff like how the request response cycle works, how web frameworks are structured, etc. Maybe find an online course that walks you through learning/implementing stuff/projects/frameworks.\n\nEdit: and learn to debug properly!

Early on, I also felt that I didn't get much mentorship and was just thrown into the deep end, asked to implement feature X, enhancement Y, or bugfix Z, in a huge codebase, with little guidance. Though, now I feel quite fortunate because I ended up learning a lot from those early experiences, a lot more than I think most devs early in their careers would.\n\nI also have felt the same way with AI, especially when it's crunch time and I need to really accelerate my output. Something that has helped me is treating it more like a search engine to find information I need, but I write the almost all the code myself. I really try to understand what it's telling me and will cross reference with other resources as well. This makes it so I really understand and know that I can backup the code I have written if i'm questioned during a PR. I also maintain a large personal document of just general CS concepts and fundementals; whenever I learn something new from AI (and confirmed it's correct), i'll add it to this document. So I kind of force myself to constantly learn and understand what i'm doing, while still reaping the benefit of AI.\n\nIf you have been doing alright so far and it sounds like you spend a lot of time trying to improve outside of work, I feel like your feeling of being totally lost may largely be imposter syndrome. Sure AI can generate a lot of code, but you would still be reading and understanding it to ensure it is applicable for your situation and actually works. So I think you probably know more than you think. I also believe that completely cutting AI out would not be beneficial in the long term, because using it is a skill in itself, and is likely to just continue to get more important.\n\n  \nOtherwise, it sounds like you're doing all the right things. Keep working on personal projects, use and learn technologies that interest you and that are in demand, and continue to challenge yourself with Leetcodes. You're still a grad (i'm assuming), you're not going to know everything straightaway and there will always be plenty more for you to learn. If you are serious about wanting to become a better engineer and focus on that, in time you will.",

Try reading the documentation or looking at other code in the repo that does something similar and figure out why and how it works. After you write it, then ask chat gpt what it thinks or how it works but keep in mind it‚Äôs a probabilistic model so it could be wrong. Always double check with the documentation or look up articles by vetted sources that have written about the same piece of technology. It‚Äôll give you way more insight.\n\nTechnology is a huge field and there are so many layers as well as tools. I remember being a fresh new grad and even though I learned about the different components in computer systems and how memory is evicted out of ram and how different networking protocols  handled communication. Getting my first internship all of that was so abstracted from me by the tools we were using that I felt like I had no idea why things were written the way they were or why we used certain tools.\n\nTake time to ask questions and learn the answers to those questions. Take notes and study them. Slowly it all starts coming together and years later you know exactly how the service or app you‚Äôre working on is leveraging the framework and language you‚Äôre using and working together with the os on the server or computer it runs on to do the things that it is doing. \n\nI will say this. I was overwhelmed at the beginning. I think most people are. I really enjoyed being able to build something by just writing some code. But it was extremely frustrating at times and sometimes I wondered if I was in the wrong profession. It took me finding out it was really rewarding knowing so much of how things worked to find passion in my career and stick with it.",

The key is making sure your projects stand out - instead of building generic todo apps, try to create something that solves a real problem or demonstrates genuine technical curiosity. Focus on one language really well rather than jumping around, and make sure you can explain every line of code in your projects because interviewers will dig deep. When you do start interviewing, [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) can help you navigate those tricky technical questions and coding challenges that often trip up newer developers - I'm on the team that built it specifically to help people handle the pressure of real-time problem solving during interviews.",

The reality is that most people don't have perfect alignment between their experience and job requirements - companies post wish lists, not hard requirements. You have 4 years of experience touching multiple areas of the data stack, which means you have transferable skills and the ability to learn quickly. The key is reframing your experience to highlight what you do know rather than focusing on what you don't.\n\nStop trying to become an expert in everything and pick one path to focus on. If you want data engineering, lean into your Databricks and PySpark experience even if it was 2 years ago - refresh yourself with some quick projects and be honest about the timeline when asked. For the business analyst roles, emphasize your analytical thinking and problem-solving approach even without direct client interaction. The 60-day notice period is definitely a challenge, but some companies will wait for the right candidate, especially if you're upfront about it early in the process.

Since you enjoyed complex SQL queries and system design, lean into that - start building projects that let you implement interesting database architectures or solve actual scaling problems. Think about creating something like a URL shortener with custom analytics, a chat application that handles real concurrency issues, or even contributing to open source projects where you can work on meaningful backend challenges. The key is picking projects where you'll naturally encounter and solve the problems that backend engineers face daily, rather than building yet another CRUD API. When it comes to interviews, having deep knowledge about fewer technologies and being able to discuss real problems you've solved will always beat surface-level familiarity with everything on a job posting.\n\nI'm on the team that built [interview AI assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we created it specifically to help people navigate those tricky technical interview questions where you need to demonstrate your problem-solving approach, not just recite memorized answers.",

Nine years of development work has given you problem-solving skills, debugging expertise, and the ability to work with legacy systems that many companies desperately need. The fact that you've built end-to-end applications shows you understand the full development lifecycle, which is valuable even if you haven't dealt with massive scale. Desktop applications often involve complex business logic and performance considerations that translate well to other domains.\n\nThe key is reframing your story during interviews. Focus on the technical challenges you've solved, the business impact of your work, and your ability to learn new technologies quickly. When system design questions come up, be upfront about your experience level but walk through your thought process methodically. Companies often care more about how you think through problems than whether you've personally managed a million-user system. For tricky technical questions like these, use [interview helper AI](http://interviews.chat) to practice different scenarios and get real-time guidance on how to structure your responses - I'm on the team that built it and it's been helpful for navigating those challenging system design discussions that can make or break senior-level interviews.",

If anything you should want to transfer to computer engineering.\n\nYou should note that certificates are not certifications. Certificates are what you get when you finish random online tutorials. Certifications are from (paid) accredited institutions that (thanks to marketing) signal to employers you have a baseline knowledge of what you're applying for. As a college student, your best chance is through an internship. Cybersecurity jobs, at least the fun ones, are harder and much more scarce than SWE roles. Most companies do not need in-house cybersecurity roles, let alone of the offensive kind.  It's definitely not something you'd do instead of SWE if you just want money. The ROI is much less.\n\nAlso, for a lot of certifications,  they are priced with the intention that people's employers will pay for them. I've done an internship in a company that would spend >$2500 per course, per person, not even counting travel to workshops/conferences and in-person exams. Definitely not something a student should be trying to fund themselves.\n\nTry CMU's free website:\n\n[pwn.college](http://pwn.college)",

Polymorphism and SOLID principles fall under object-oriented programming fundamentals, language features are just the specific syntax and capabilities of your chosen programming languages, and the \"unknown unknowns\" you mention are likely design patterns, software architecture concepts, and best practices that come up frequently in technical interviews.\n\nThe good news is that these concepts are well-documented and there are tons of resources out there. Search for \"OOP fundamentals,\" \"SOLID principles explained,\" \"JavaScript/Python/Java interview questions,\" and \"software design patterns\" on YouTube and you'll find plenty of content. Focus on understanding the why behind these concepts rather than just memorizing definitions, because interviewers love to ask follow-up questions that test your actual comprehension. I'm on the team that built [interview helper](http://interviews.chat), and we've found that practicing these concepts in a conversational format really helps people internalize them better than just watching videos alone.",

If you‚Äôre at all interested in Data Science I would strongly consider that offer. If not then I would generally just focus elsewhere - Data Science doesn‚Äôt really work as a fallback plan or a 2nd option without a lot of school or a lot of experience. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt consider internships unless they build significant skills or significant inroads at a company you want connections with. You‚Äôre trying to establish your career at this point so an internship is just a lower paid lower commitment job - it needs to offer enough to balance that out. \n\nThat leaves the 2 backend offers and the SRE job in consideration if you discard the Data Science role. SRE is a bit more specialized - you won‚Äôt build those skills incidentally, it needs to be intentional. It pays well and is in demand, so if you enjoy it it‚Äôs not a bad place to focus your efforts. Backend Engineering roles are good general roles and hard to fault, but they don‚Äôt build a specific specialty either. Nothing wrong with just building general experience to start though. \n\nId consider the SRE or DS roles if those fields specifically interest you. If a specific niche or field doesn‚Äôt feel right then just take a backend role and take the XP for a pivot later. I wouldn‚Äôt take the internship unless there‚Äôs a serious upside on the other side of it. Don‚Äôt take the opportunity for SRE or DS experience for granted though - it‚Äôs easier to get it early in your career. Later on you might have to contemplate a salary cut if you‚Äôre weighing mid / senior level vs having to step backwards to DS I. It‚Äôs hard to apply for DS II / Sr roles without experience in those roles, especially on a Bachelors, so the opportunity to get that experience is valuable if you have it (same for SRE).",

It's a tough hiring market so you might as well collect a paycheck while job searching at the very least.",
