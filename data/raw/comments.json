Open the reports/dashboards the next day, and it was basically DOA. \n\nSo I go to the digital marketing manager guy doing the project and said \"hey man, there's like nothing happening here wtf?\" And he said \"Oh sorry the marketing launch got pushed by two weeks, but we forgot to tell you\".

Every cloud has always had a model of 'cheap to put stuff into it and expensive to take it out' it only makes sense that they would look at Fivetran and say 'we could offer this for way cheaper by only supporting our own cloud and making up the profit on extra usage/storage in our cloud after the data is there.

We thought SQLMesh might be that thing, but now I'm leaning towards something like [Kedro+Ibis](https://kedro.org/blog/building-scalable-data-pipelines-with-kedro-and-ibis)\\+[BSL](https://juhache.substack.com/p/the-boring-semantic-layer), and/or higher level abstraction that can be AI-native, with built-in best practices.\n\nI'm confident in the future of open source data transformations because of two things:\n\n1. **Existing users are fine.** If and when Fivetran tries to monetize dbt to the detriment of its users, the community will almost certainly **fork** dbt-core to maintain its openness (gratis+libre) for the longterm. However, the investments from the dbtLabs folks will almost certainly slow down or stop. Which means dbt may be staleware in a few years.\n2. **Necessity is the mother of invention.** The acquisition alone is reason to inspire others to build higher-level abstractions that don't inherit dbt's innate weaknesses. *(Does anyone really think dbt+Jinja was the ideal solution?)* The next generation of transformation solutions should accomplish more with less code, and with semantic metadata baked in.\n\nI've built three dbt clones in my career, two of which were *before* dbt itself launched, and one of which was successfully [patented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10846284B1/en) during my time at Amazon AWS. I am eternally thankful to dbt because it was the first CI/CD-friendly transformation tool to reach critical market share. The dbt team proved to the world that \"transformations as code\" is viable and that data pipelines are not incompatible with SDLC best practices.\n\nThe future has been changed for the better because dbt exists, but dbt is neither the only solution nor the best solution for the problems data engineers face today and tomorrow.\n\nThere will be more and better solutions on the horizon. 😎",

Photon, catalyst, etc. won’t do it for you. There is an enormous amount of electricity and money burning out there in unoptimized Spark jobs, where a traditionals RDBMS SQL shop was convinced they can unlock 20% performance by just migrating to Databricks, whereas with a little investment they could achive 10x+ faster and more efficient jobs. (Little investment on top of the fairly costly retooling.)\n\nSo no, if you are a SQL shop, don’t just move to DBX blindly.

I find that in general I can develop faster in Coalesce.   \n  \nLineage is easy to track. The testing is alright. I prefer the scheduling and deployment process over dbts. I find It is harder to break things in Coalesce. Coalesce has improved this a lot since they started.    \n  \nThere is still times where I end up writing complex sql by hand and shoving it into to Coalesce, but I never have to do basic grunt work by hand, so I appreciate that. That is all handled by the templates.  \n\nPerformance wise they are pretty similar both dbt and coalesce are in general SQL driven.  \n\nI haven't used dataform so I can't say anything about that.",

Reduces redundancy: Redundancy is when the same information is stored multiple times, and a good way of avoiding this is by splitting data into smaller tables.\n>  1. Improves query performance: You can perform faster query execution on smaller tables that have undergone normalization.\n>  1. Minimizes **update anomalies**: With normalized tables, you can easily update data without affecting other records.\n>  1. Enhances data integrity: It ensures that data remains consistent and accurate.\n\nAnyway, I'll encourage you to skim their section about \"update anomalies\" and focus on the examples.",

This does have some tradeoffs with regards to keeping a long running transaction open if your processing is slow, but if you can't query data in a streaming fashion it's very limiting for memory efficiency ",

I have regular flare-ups of imposter syndrome, but have come to realize this usually happens under high negative pressure from unrealistic deadlines, poisonous office politics, or when I’m simply ill or haven’t been sleeping enough. The good days by far offset the bad ones, and I’ll realize that there are plenty of essential skills and experience that I bring to the table that typical CS profiles bring less of: e.g. engineers tend to ‘tunnel’ into technical problem solving and often struggle to zoom out and grasp the broader domain context. I have experience in multiple business process domains and in financial management, which in turn drives (executive) decision making. If you don’t grasp that, you can design fantastic technical solutions, but won’t ever get top down support to fund and execute against them.\n\nSo, we can all learn from each other and together we create success. In my spare time I dig into my team’s code and do engineering training/certifications to learn more about that space and better lead my teams by asking better questions. \n\nI cannot judge whether you’re too far out of your depth in your current role, or whether you’re simply suffering the discomfort that actually indicates that you’re in the ‘learning zone’. That’s up to you to figure out. Just don’t be afraid to fail and don’t walk away out of fear. And take care of your physical and mental health while you’re working on your professional growth.

You'll learn by shipping stuff.\n1b - Yes learn DBT\n1c - Don't think about it just ship.\n\n2a - Get a solid, easy to expand ETL/ELT service going. Adding more data to your DW should be *easy*. When non-data people come to you with \"oh I wanted to see X data that's not on the DW\", you should be like \"oh I'll get it there for you\" and within a few bizdays it's there. Have an ELT/ETL layer that's simple and easy to expand, and this sort of interaction will happen.\n\n2b - You should be chilling in your spare time, you'll learn all you need by working on building the stuff that's just beyond what you can comfortably deliver right now. Progressive overload. Don't settle, but don't try to reach for the moon right away. Build yourself a ladder first.\n\n2c - Just build stuff, and when the subject come up you say you're learning data engineering on the fly, out of necessity.\n\n\nIf you're doing any sort of data-related study in your spare time, I recommend the more theoretical, foundational stuff. Kimball's data modelling, Klepmann's Data Intensive Applications, SICP. This sort of mind-expanding work that makes you stop thinking about code (trees) and start thinking about systems, data transport, semantics, read/write patterns (the forest).",

Revive dbt for staging, marts, incremental models on large tables, tests (unique/not null, referential), and source freshness; publish dbt docs so Metabase fields have descriptions. Start scheduling with GitHub Actions or a simple EC2 cron, then move to Step Functions or MWAA; add alerts via SNS. Point Metabase at marts only, use segments/metrics, row-level security for client views, and pre-aggregated tables with indexes to speed dashboards. Call out bad practices: reporting off OLTP, manual Excel copies, shared creds, no environments, laptop crons, no backfill plan, inconsistent IDs, and sloppy PII access. Learn IAM, S3, RDS, Lambda, Step Functions, Terraform basics, CDC with DMS/Debezium, and Kimball + SQL tuning.

If you don't consider how you want to manage Infrastructure in this new world you get to great my advice would be look at a reference architecture for a lake house on AWS. Ask your company to send you to re:Invent in December take hands onlabs for building data lakes (avoid any sales sessions just do hands on labs) you will come out with a better idea of what to do. Also take a BASIC terraform course. It will make everything better. It will be confusing at first but ChatGPT/Claude will get you most of the way there. AWS + Python gives you A LOT of options. IMO DBT is kinda shitty. SQL ETL's are ass, because you cannot really unit test these things effectively. Focus more on python (it will get you 90% of what you need for most use cases) look at serverless event driven architectures, less work less thinking long term but you need to monitor that shit and make sure the SPICE FLOWS! Postgres is fine. Your use cases determine your data persistence. If you don't have a lot of data don't over complicate shit use and RDBMS + Python, geter done.\n2. look back at 1. I personally don't think much of DEs that focused on DBT or Databricks they usually don't know much....sorry to say that but it's the truth. I want coders. I want people who understand distributed systems. I don't care if people know Redshift of Snowflake as long as they understand what those systems are...MPPs. That's abstracted from most DEs. It means Sr folks have to learn ya some shit about an MPP like redshift and snowflake both great infra but they cost and abstract aspects of what's going on under the hood. They are not a golden hammer. Look at the use cases. Postgres on aurora can bang out A LOT of DE use cases. Don't buy a destroyer class ship to manage bass fishing :D\n\nb. pyspark is a good thing to pick up. Understand when you want a python script v a pyspark script to run a job. Understand shit like Airflow and how you split compute from your orchestration layer. Airflow is not an ETL it's orchestration. ELT work and computer is done on other infra like an AWS lambda. As you go further focus on microservices, apis, event driven architectures stuff like that. \n\nc. AWS tools are legit DE tools you just gotta look at the right shit. Get a cursory understanding  these AWS servies (timebox yourself to a few hours  total here) EventBridge, Kinesis, Manage Ariflow, managed kafka, lambdas, glue, redshift. aurora(postgresql). Athena.  You can solve pretty much all problems with these with out really managing much infra. I can count on one hand the number of times my serverless systems have died in production....AWS went down  each time :D.....that was a long one DM me I am an old hand. Happy to answer questions.\n\nPS avoid Pandas unless you are working on small scale stuff it's a fucking huge package with way more stuff than you need in most cases. That said it's super convenient to bang out small tasks on small contianers.",

Ideally, this should be an exact replica of production in order to address the exact challenge you raise.\n\nTo ensure that your code changes aren't breaking things, you should have some sort of data unit testing framework as well. The way I typically tackle this is to have a tiny, but representative, csv of data for each source table. Key tables (marts, facts, entities etc.) throughout my DAG also have csv files of expected outputs. When making code changes, run the sample source data through your pipeline and verify that the output table still matches the contents of your csv of expected results. Or that the updates you've made to your csv of expected results are indeed what emerges from your DAG.\n\nA big part of my dbt evangelism arises from the fact that implementing the above is quite handy when using dbt. But it's also doable regardless of your stack if you take the time to build the framework for it.",

From your BI tool's perspective this'll be as if there are denormalized tables, but when the tool queries these tables the view will be executed.\n   * This works if your data is small, but it gets harder to maintain, debug, and scale for larger datasets.\n* The more maintainable alternative here is to build a \"data pipeline\":\n   * The pipeline would get the raw data from the production systems, as well as any other external systems you need data from.\n   * Builds data models using SQL and Python and persists them into the database.\n   * Your BI tools then connects to the modeled tables instead.\n   * This allows the queries to be more efficient and faster, since the data is pre-calculated.\n   * This also makes analyzing this data easier in BI usecases.\n   * The added benefit of this is that if you want to use a different BI tool tomorrow, or if you need to use this data in some other way than a BI tool, such as jupyter notebooks and python scripts, then the data is also usable for that.\n\nThere are a bazillion different tools that allow you to build data pipelines. In your case, it could be as simple as starting with a few views on your Postgres database, and see how it works. Once you run into performance issues or any other trouble, you can consider persisting the data with a proper data pipeline.",

There are three options in the market today - (1) dynamic tables in snowflake, (2) delta live tables in databricks, and (3) tabsdata that also does ingestion.\n\nGiven that you are just starting out and may not be in one of the big data platforms, try tabsdata.

Add basic tests (not null, unique, accepted values) and indexes on join keys and dates. Orchestrate with Airflow or Dagster; Airbyte or Fivetran can help pull from sources.

The way you have rewritten it causes two extra full table scans & aggregations rather than the specified exists / not exists. [Working from the docs PDF page 64](https://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-h_v2.17.2.pdf):\n\n    AND EXISTS (\n        SELECT *\n        FROM lineitem l2\n        WHERE l2.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey\n        AND   l2.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey\n    )\n    AND NOT EXISTS (\n        SELECT *\n        FROM lineitem l3\n        WHERE l3.l_orderkey    = l1.l_orderkey\n        AND   l3.l_suppkey    <> l1.l_suppkey\n        AND   l3.l_receiptdate > l3.l_commitdate\n    )\n\nYou use an approach which scans and aggregates all orders then conducts a set comparison:\n\n    AND l1.l_orderkey IN (\n        SELECT l_orderkey\n        FROM lineitem\n        GROUP BY l_orderkey\n        HAVING COUNT(l_suppkey) > 1\n    )\n    AND l1.l_orderkey NOT IN (\n        SELECT l_orderkey\n        FROM lineitem\n        WHERE l_receiptdate > l_commitdate\n        GROUP BY l_orderkey\n        HAVING COUNT(l_suppkey) > 1\n    )\n\nThe second is that there exists no other supplier who delayed the order.  In CH you can't refer to parts outside the subquery, but you can achieve the same result by re-ordering the logic slightly without a full table scan & aggregation:\n\n    WITH base AS (\n        SELECT\n            li1.l_orderkey AS \"o_key\",\n            sup.s_name     AS \"s_name\",\n            COUNT(1)       AS \"line_count\"\n        FROM supplier AS sup\n        JOIN lineitem AS li1 ON li1.l_suppkey   = sup.s_suppkey\n        JOIN orders   AS odr ON odr.o_orderkey  = li1.l_orderkey\n        JOIN nation   AS nat ON nat.n_nationkey = sup.s_nationkey\n        ANY JOIN lineitem AS li2 -- Other suppliers were present\n            ON  li2.l_orderkey = li1.l_orderkey\n            AND li2.l_suppkey != li1.l_suppkey\n        WHERE odr.o_orderstatus = 'F'\n        AND   li1.l_receiptdate > li1.l_commitdate -- The supplier delivered late\n        AND   nat.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA' -- Specified by benchmark\n        GROUP BY li1.l_orderkey, sup.s_name\n    )\n    , sole AS (\n        SELECT o_key\n        FROM base\n        GROUP BY o_key\n        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT s_name) = 1\n    )\n    SELECT\n        base.s_name,\n        SUM(base.line_count) AS \"numwait\" -- Appears to be what the original benchmark is after\n    FROM base\n    JOIN sole ON sole.o_key = base.o_key -- Assert only this supplier caused delays\n    GROUP BY base.s_name\n    ORDER BY SUM(base.line_count) DESC, sup.s_name\n\nIn general, explore the range of different joins such as [any join](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-fully-supports-joins-part1#left--right--inner-any-join) and [anti join](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-fully-supports-joins-part1#left--right-anti-join) which Clickhouse has and be careful translating exists / not exists from the benchmark spec.

For speed, use Extract Data in Looker Studio on top of your fact tables. \n\n\n\nFor handoff/sell: include a cost dashboard, a runbook (schemas, schedules, service account permissions), version-controlled SQL in a client-owned repo, and a light maintenance retainer.

On the build, do CDC from Postgres with Debezium into Kafka, land in S3/Delta, model with dbt, orchestrate in Airflow or Prefect, enforce tests with Great Expectations, track lineage with OpenLineage or Unity Catalog, and expose curated tables via simple APIs. I’ve run this with Snowflake and dbt plus Airflow, and used DreamFactory to spin up REST APIs from legacy SQL Server so ingestion and prototyping didn’t stall. Document medallion zones, data contracts, RBAC, CI/CD (Terraform + GitHub Actions), cost guardrails, and observability; add a small RAG demo on curated data to bridge your LLM work.

It has an SQL query engine (optionally serverless) based on a proprietary, massively parallel processing columnar database engine and an old fork of PostgreSQL 8. It has its own specific table storage optimizations such as distribution styles and sort keys. It is designed for data warehousing and BI.\n\nAthena is newer (2016), and solely a query engine (based on open-source Trino by default, or Spark), so you need to manage the data storage in another tool, such as S3. It's designed for interactive querying on data lakes, while Glue is designed for ETL. Although it doesn't mean you can't use Athena for transformations, I just would not bet that it will be cheaper than Glue (serverless Spark) for production ETLs. The design of interactive query tools is usually made to be faster in exchange for more resources consumption, which may not be the best trade-off for production ETLs.\n\nRunning Spark on EMR may be a cheaper way to run distributed SQL transformations on AWS, but then you have to deal with EMR cluster management.",

Put escape hatches in contracts (export everything, 90-day license change notice, no feature-only lock-in) and keep a self-hosted path warm with IaC and a quarterly failover drill. Standardize on portable interfaces to reduce switching pain (Kafka API, Parquet on S3, Trino/ANSI SQL). Watch vendor risk signals: neutral governance, license history, bus factor, cadence, and how many third-party integrations exist. Airbyte handles ingestion and Trino covers federated queries; DreamFactory auto-generates secure REST APIs over our databases so product teams can ship without bespoke ETL.

Edit: I see that you say the MI has Admin permission in the Fabric workspace, so you should be covered there already. If the notebook and warehouse are in different workspaces, the MI will probably need at least Contributor in both workspaces. It doesn't need to have any permissions on the capacity.\n\nPerhaps the .synapsesql() just doesn't work when triggered by MI. This seems to be a related case: https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Warehouse/Service-Principal-Getting-quot-HTTP-request-forbidden-quot-When/m-p/4832636\n\nAs a workaround, you can write to a Lakehouse table (and, if you insist on using a Warehouse, you can use API to do a metadata sync of the Lakehouse SQL Analytics Endpoint and then load the data from the Lakehouse SQL Analytics Endpoint into the Warehouse using a T-SQL script/stored procedure).\n\nRe: Storage blob contributor. No, it should not be relevant here. Storage blob roles are Azure roles. In Fabric, the Workspace Contributor (or Member/Admin) is what matters.",

Marquez will be your lineage system of record.  \nFull blown catalogs (DataHub, OpenMetadata, Amundsen) are powerful but often carry multiple services and background workers; they’re worth it long term but may feel heavy for your constraints (OpenMetadata does offer a SQLite connector though).",

I had just actually pivoted into Product Management and my new contract was cancelled after 3 weeks. So I had to completely start over. I ended up doing 4 rounds of panel interviews with this marketing company in 4 days. All of this has happened in the last week. So I’m looking at a 2 week hiring process when my last job took 3 months from first interview to onboarding. Life is crazy. Oh and I’ll be going from $62.50 an hour as a contractor as a Product Manager to 135k per year as an FTE with way better bonus and benefits and PTO. Also the DE job is 4 days a week WFH versus maybe 1 with the PM job.",

It also saves time.\n   * You can expand the list of sources that you cover. You can take a look at ready-made platforms or open-source tools to ingest data from all these different sources you need.\n   * At this stage, the data would land in a place you control in a certain layout and structure at least.\n* In terms of formats, the answer would depend very heavily on the types of formats:\n   * If you have machine-readable formats like JSON, CSV, Excel files, Parquet files, and whatnot, this just becomes an orchestration problem, throw a data pipeline tool on it and you are golden.\n   * I presume that's not the only thing, since you give the PDF example. Parsing PDFs with varying schemas over time is a hell I don't wish my worst enemies to go through, so that's not easy.\n   * I have recently played around with Mistral's OCR model to extract a bunch of invoice data and it worked flawlessly, tackled \\~95% of our incoming invoices.\n   * This would still require you to build a data pipeline solution around this, where the underlying work would be done by an AI model that would extract the structured data.\n   * Once you have the structured data out, you would store this data in a data warehouse or a data lake with a clear schema and structure.\n\nFrom this point onwards, you would have a:\n\n* Central lake where you store the raw files\n* A data warehouse / data lake where you store the extracted and structured data\n\nThis would theoretically get you to a better place. Obviously, what I wrote above contains a huge list of assumptions, but hopefully it helps with the general idea.",

I also started logging structure patterns and using them as templates to detect format changes early. It’s still not perfect, but it reduced the constant rewriting.\n\nOut of curiosity, are your PDFs more like structured tables or messy text-based reports?

That way you end up with more clarity on which column goes to what.  And optionally, you can prefix each column name with the role play if that works best for your reporting tool.

Track docid, sourceurl, lastseenetag, dochash, embedmodel, embedversion, chunkid, chunkhash, qdrantid, status, and pagination watermarks. DynamoDB works well (GSIs on status/source + TTL for old versions), though Postgres is fine if you want richer queries. In Temporal, run per-document workflows with chunking/embedding as children; batch Qdrant upserts and use idempotency keys like hash(docid|chunkidx|embedversion). Keep S3 versioning and a manifest so you can replay safely. In Qdrant, index payload fields (docid, version), and retire old vectors by version when a doc changes.

It sucks because you could be a perfectly competent data engineer who builds solid pipelines without knowing every detail of the DAG scheduler or executor memory management, but some companies use these deep theory questions as a filtering mechanism. The frustrating part is there's no universal standard - one company wants you to explain catalyst optimizer stages, another just wants to see you write a working transformation. Your best bet is to have a baseline understanding of the theory (what happens when you call an action vs transformation, basic execution model, why shuffles are expensive) but don't kill yourself memorizing every architectural detail unless you're targeting companies known for this style of interviewing.\n\nThe shift in how you prepare should really depend on the signals you're getting from your interviews. If you're consistently hitting walls on theory questions, then yeah, dedicate more time to understanding the \"why\" and \"how\" beneath the surface. But if you're getting through technical rounds and failing elsewhere, your time might be better spent on system design, communication skills, or just doing more practice problems. The truth is most associate-level work doesn't require you to debug Spark's physical plan daily, but being able to speak intelligently about it shows depth of knowledge that some interviewers value highly.\n\nIf you want help for these unpredictable theory questions when they come up, I built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of curveball interview scenarios.",

The special thing about a system call is that it allows *user* code (running with low privileges) to call *kernel* code (running with high privileges) in a controlled way.\n\nThe kernel can \"receive\" syscalls from user code, but within the kernel itself, plain old function calls are used. If you read the source code for Linux, which is written in C, you'll mostly just see a lot of functions calling other functions.\n\nIn terms of what those function calls within the kernel actually *do*: sometimes they just manipulate data, like any other function you might write yourself. For instance, the \"list of running processes\" is a kernel data structure, so when you start a new process running with the `fork` and `exec` syscalls, you're just calling kernel code that adds a new entry to that list.\n\nSimilarly, when you use a syscall like `write` to \"print\" text from your program, normally what you're really doing is writing characters to a queue (a.k.a. a pipe or FIFO). Some other part of the system (e.g. a terminal emulator) is going to read those characters and figure out how to display them on the screen. The queue itself belongs to the kernel, so programs use syscalls to ask the kernel to read and write it.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the kernel code has to manipulate hardware. It usually does this by accessing special memory addresses ([memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O)) which read or write the corresponding registers in a hardware device. The kernel's higher privilege level allows it to do this directly. User code is normally forbidden from doing this by the CPU's memory protection hardware.",

(Giving up trying to get Reddit to render a spoiler block, sorry!)\n\n    const R = 1, P = 2, S = 3;\n    \n    const LUT = {0: 0}; // Draw.\n    LUT[R-S] = LUT[P-R] = LUT[S-P] = 1; // P1 win.\n    LUT[R-P] = LUT[P-S] = LUT[S-R] = 2; // P2 win.\n    \n    const winner = (p1, p2) => LUT[p1-p2];\n    \n    let p1_score = 0, p2_score = 0, p1_in, p2_in, result;\n    \n    while (1) {\n      p1_in = prompt('Player 1 (R=1 P=2 S=3): ');\n      if (p1_in === null) break;\n      p2_in = prompt('Player 2 (R=1 P=2 S=3): ');\n      if (p2_in === null) break;\n    \n      result = winner(p1_in, p2_in)\n    \n      switch (result) {\n        case 1: ++p1_score; break;\n        case 2: ++p2_score; break;\n        default: alert('Draw.'); continue;\n      }\n    \n      alert(`Winner: Player ${result}`);\n    }\n    \n    alert(`Final score (P1-P2): ${p1_score}-${p2_score}`);",

Here's how you should think about it: **The snake is a queue**!\n\nEverytime it moves, a new position is added to one end of the queue (that is the head) and the last position in the queue is removed from the queue (that is the end of the tail). Except when eating something, the tail is not removed. So you don't change the position of the head, you \"add\" a new head in front of the snake, depending on the direction it is moving.\n\nUse an actual Queue data structure if you can - that makes everything easier. And if not, then at least abstract the queue for the snake-body, so you don't have to worry about the array-index of head and or tail when building the game.\n\nHope that helps - good luck with coding it now!",

Yet, the for loop is shorter, clearer to understand, and in the end easier to read.\n\nIn practical use, it is a bit different:\n\n+ use `while` when the amount of iterations depends on a certain condition that must be met (the loop runs as long as the condition is true)\n+ use `for` when you know the amount of iterations beforehand, like the size of an array, collection, a certain amount of repetitions to do something, etc.",

All of the benefits can be realized elsewhere, though it may take more effort on your part to get them. \n\nYour professor may just be competitive by nature and find competitions motivating, but that doesn't mean you have to also.",

The best outcome is one where you're able to do stuff like make your own implementation just by reasoning about it years later.

This forces your brain to recall actively rather than just re-reading.\n\nAlso, focus on understanding the logic and pattern behind a problem rather than the exact code. If you can explain the approach in words or pseudocode, you’ll remember it better and can reconstruct the code when needed.\n\nThen, reimplement problems from scratch without looking at your old code. Even 10–15 minutes to redo a problem is more effective than reading it again. Over time, the patterns stick, and you don’t need to memorize every solution line by line.",

Rarely can you get all three at once.\n\nObject-oriented programming and functional programming are approaches for managing system complexity. With OOP, you're defining components as \"objects\" with specific functionalities so that you have a system-wide vocabulary for what things do. Furthermore, by making things modular, you limit how much you have to fit in your head at any one time in order to change the system.\n\nWith functional programming, you're trying to isolate state to as few places as possible and keep all your functions throughout your system simple and deterministic, so when you're writing a function you have a finite number of ways that function can behave and it's simple to create, write, and test.\n\nI have met very few engineers who understand why OOP and FP are desirable. They just follow them dogmatically because they were taught them in college and don't know how to do things another way. Furthermore, they often do them wrong. They think simply using functions is FP or just defining boilerplate objects is OOP without actually writing coherent modules to reduce system complexity.\n\nIf you'd like a more robust discussion on this, my favorite book on the topic is \"A Philosophy of Software Design\" by John Ousterhout. Hope you found this comment helpful.",

There's no reason for OOP other than to make it easier for humans to work with code.\n\nIn my opinion, the most useful purpose of OOP is to let you establish rules, so that somebody working with your code can't accidentally use it wrong.\n\nThat's why it's so popular at large companies. Someone can design a class and give it a very simple public interface. They can then trust that junior engineers can safely call the public interface and it will work correctly.\n\nSimilarly, it can enable someone to extend an existing well-written class and customize its behavior while ensuring the core functionality still works.\n\nWithout OOP, it'd be much easier for lots of people all working on the same project to do something wrong or break something.\n\nSometimes the goal is to enforce rules for yourself! Even if you're the only one working on a program, OOP provides a way to organize it and help keep you from accidentally using your own code the wrong way.",

Like, people are still arguing over what this term means to this day, and they refuse to agree on a concrete definition.\n\nTypically though, OOP is, unsurprisingly centered around the idea of \"objects\"; encapsulated bundles of data, and methods that can interact with a given instance of said data. Under an OOP framework, a program is simply various interactions between different component objects.\n\nIn a Tamagotchi, you have a 'pet', that gets fed 'food' that you buy from the 'store', and keep in your 'inventory' until needed. The 'pet' can have different 'states' that effect its behaviour - states like \"hungry\", \"happy\" or \"dead\". All of these are displayed to the user of the game by a 'game window', and specific information can be managed by a 'settings manager'. You get the gist.\n\nMany people argue that OOP has proverbial 'pillars'; \"encapsulation\" (keeping related fields and methods bundled together in classes), \"inheritance\" (objects can inherit behaviour of other objects), and \"polymorphism\" (use an interface, dummy), but that's another question, and whether some of them matter enough is again, in contention.",

An example of this would be creating an instance of a class called HTTPServer and using it will cause it to start an http server without exposing you to the underlying sockets or network protocols to make it work - you don’t need to know all of the variables used by HTTPServer.",

For example, some compilers courses will have you write a compiler and others will just teach the theory and test you in it. Check the course before signing up to make sure it is not too theory heavy.\n\nThis is how you learn programming fundamentals, by learning how other people solved hard problems and then reimplementing the solutions yourself. For example, instead of learning about software design in an abstract sense, just learn about operating systems. You'll learn all the OOP principles. Separation of concerns, modularization, polymorphism. And what's even cooler is you'll learn it all in a language that isn't even OOP and then you will have an aha moment when you realize OOP is not the foundation.\n\nIf you have extra time to study, spend it doing the optional challenge exercises or questions on your homeworks/labs or join a team building a project.

The CPU saves its current instruction location (as memory address somewhere in a CPU register), and this increases after each executed instruction.\n\nThe compiler initially arranges that each function is a separate block of consecutive instructions.\n\nTo \"call\" a function, there's be basically instruction that says \"now jump elsewhere, to this specific address\" in the \"parent\" function. The target address is the start of the function that should be called.\n\nAnd still before that, the parent function saves it's current instruction position somewhere on the stack (in a specific defined location, not just anywhere). This is necessary to that when the called function ends, it can jump back to the position the parent function stopped. For this reason, most usual functions have such a jump at the end added by the compiler.",

In this case, it's nice to be able to pull in just the external data definitions, and not the rest of the class.\n\n\nIt's been a while, so I can't remember off the top of my head how this shows up when you hit a circular include, but keep it in mind as you start to add more features.",

If you have to switch to language \"Z\" you have to start at zero again.\n\nFar more important than tutorials once one is past the fundamentals is to work on your own, without tutorials. This is how to *really* learn programming.\n\nThe repo you listed is not too bad, yet, you should probably use it in a different way than intended: use it as inspiration, as guideline and then develop *your own* implementation.

Most of the tutorials you find online are articles on blogs or YouTube videos, and they tend to cover some specific topic. In order to get the big picture that you need when you're learning a new language or large framework, you'd need to read/watch dozens of those types of tutorials, often from multiple authors, and try to synthesize general knowledge from that hodgepodge of specifics. I'd avoid any book with the word \"cookbook\" in the title for the same reason.\n\nWhat you want when you're learning a big topic is a big, comprehensive source that was built to teach that larger topic from soup to nuts, so you take a well-planned path through all the material you need and get a single, coherent perspective. To me, that mostly means getting a good book and working your way through it, but courses like the ones offered online by Stanford, Harvard, etc. would also work well.",

It’s very far away from web-dev, but the other day I had to throw together a simple dashboard for some telemetry we are collecting. \n\nLearning programming is a long journey, with many different paths to take. My opinion is that any kind of programming experience is good, even things that might seem unrelated on the surface.\n\nHowever, all the companies I’ve worked at (both small startups and large corporations, in Germany or the US) are only looking for candidates that have a masters or PhD in a relevant field.

Well no one is going to hire a backend dev for example with 0 years of experience and handle them critical data. So usually frontend is how you start or full stack in a large team and then you pivot to whatever you like more. \n\n Having said that no matter the role you apply, Being fullstack early in your career can separate you from the competition.

It sadly happens, but not too often. \n\nThe thing that does put me off quite often is when I get resumes from new graduates who decide to rate themselves out of 5 for each of their skills and put 5/5 for most of them. That's funny to me. I've been writing Java code professionally since 1999 and if I was feeling particularly confident I \\*might\\* give myself a 4. There are certainly people better than I am. \n\nDon't do that. The interviewer, if they know what is good for them, and also good for you, will be thinking not, \"can this person already do the job?\", but rather, \"is this somebody I think I could train?\". This means trying to be as solid as you can in the basics, admit the stuff you don't know, and ask them questions that make it clear that you understand that they know more than you, and you are interested in learning from them. If they are the kind of place that will expect somebody in your position to already be an experienced professional developer, they wont hire you.... and you will have dodged a bullet.",

You need to understand how to build your own project, so by watching beginning videos, you can see how arrays, loops, and functions come together.  As you go along, think of ideas for your own projects, like maybe build a calculator with HTML/CSS, then work the functionality, and with a calculator, you can make it more complex as you learn more.  Figure out how to make things functional.  I mean, you can build a webpage that looks like a blog with HTML and CSS, but how do you get comments to post for everyone to see, then allow replies?  Do you know how to do that?  That could be a project, to give things action, to make them work.  Add functionality.\n\nFurthermore, I would look into intermediate courses.   O'Reilly has a couple intermediate python courses and one of them has a live instructor.  I've been thinking of signing up for that, but haven't looked into costs.  I used to be a member and it was like 600/yr.  I just don't know if you can take 1 class for free or if you have to pay for a month or a few months.... but it may be worth looking into for you.\n\nI saw you're interning, can I ask where?  I really want that kind of hands on, real life experience myself.",

Find a beginner friendly book or course about basic consepts of programming and go through it. Know what? If you are aiming to master C++, your initial learning doesn’t even need to be in C++. Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, didn’t start out with C++, of course. He also says in interviews that every programmer would benefit from learning a handful of languages. Find some pods with Bjarne Stroustrup!\n\nMister C++ himself perhaps wouldn’t agree with this, but much of the best books on programming basics use Lisps as a vehicle. This way, they can focus on the programming itself, rather than forcing complex syntax on the reader.\n\nOne good example is “The Little Schemer” by Friedman & Felleisen. If you choose that one, I’ll spoil one thing: The “rules” and ”commandments” presented in the book are just rules within the book, meant to be applied when solving the exercises; they are generally not rules of the Scheme lang. This could be a bit confusing, if you haven’t understood it. Another thing: if you don’t solve a problem now, you maybe solve it next time. This is a simple, little book, that kind of escalates sneakily. You can read it over and over again till you get everything.",

This way you can learn how build systems work under the hood and get into makefiles and also expose yourself to valgrind (this is essential if you want to learn and do your due diligence in the craft.)\n\nAlso, it would be helpful to learn some C if you haven't already. I recommend c99 for simplicity unless you want to see what threading is all about, then go with c11 or newer. Furthermore, have a very in-depth understanding of how compiled languages differ from interpreted languages (static vs. dynamic languages, respectively)\n\nI could go at length, and for some context, I typically point to prerequisites before the actual topic one wants to study.

Sure you could read books and do your own projects but will you?  Most people will not go nearly as in depth because we tend to be lazy and disorganized.  Our bootcamp enforced attendance and had weekly challenges which were difficult enough to require several hours of time outside the class activities.\n\nSecond our challenges and course material was carefully selected to reflect current industry demands.  If you are watching YouTube videos you will likely get sucked into a small niche of data analytics rather than learning the general concepts.  This paired with instructional staff who gave feedback, showed issues and helped refine your knowledge, lead to a good base.\n\nBut aside from this the students who did well and actually got positions, which were more than I expected, were ones who continued polishing and building a portfolio.  We got them running but the finish line often requires continued education.  But you do build momentum and result in several potential portfolio projects so it is better.\n\nTLDR:  Bootcamps provide structure and accountability that self learning rarely provides unless you are very organized and driven - but students often still needed to continue working on and polishing their portfolio to get their foot in the door.",

        "body": ">However, isn't most data in computers stored as binary anyway?\n\nNot most. All. Computers are not capable of storing anything but integer values, which is why we devise so many various encoding schemes for things that aren't integers.\n\nAnd the answer it is more useful not to when treating them as string/character values, and not really all that useful when parsing a string into a numeric type. First, the idea only properly works for integers. Second, it only really works in a useful way for single digits. You need a minimum of 4 bits to count to 9 (`b1001`) and then quite a bit more for letters and punctuation. Even if we eliminate all of the control characters and limit ourselves to printable characters included in ASCII encoding, you still need at least 7 bits to cover those 95 characters with values from 0 (`b0000000`) to 94 (`b1011110`). We haven't even saved a single bit eliminating those (generally) unnecessary codes, but there aren't a lot of machines using 7-bit addressing these days, so let's assume the smallest numeric type you could use for encoding is probably 8 bits anyway. So to store the value 255 you would need 3 bytes. What's the super easy conversion to go from `b00000010-b00000101-b00000101` to `b11111111`? There isn't one really. You could argue that the conversion is still slightly simpler, but it isn't really significantly so, and it's hardly worth losing the benefits such as simpler and more performant sorting for characters.",

It took me the introductory course (with an extra course I took, because I was struggling) and a practical course with a group project in my 2. semester. After that course, I felt like I can built stuff that's really helpful for me. And that's what I did. Been programming for 13 years now. \n\nIt's definitely not about being smart. Programming is really one of the easier concepts in a CS curriculum. And Python is especially easy. I was taught Java at first (which I'm glad about). But I think you also need to either be wired to think like a programmer or you need to learn it. You will learn to think more analytically and you will learn how to solve problems. Or you will find out that that kind of thinking is just not for you.\n\nMy advice is: Just stick with it. If you can find any joy or interest in programming, then stick with it. It will click some day. If the whole experience is just a drag to you, even after trying for months, that might mean that it's not for you. Also: Don't do it for the money. If you don't enjoy it, you'll be miserable.\n\nBTW: I barely passed my introductory programming course. But once I finished the practical course in the second semester, I was an A-B student when I came to practical programming courses. They were always interesting and I always got some sort of satisfaction out of it learning new things and solving problems. Most of the time, I was the one pulling the group. So, don't worry if it's hard at first. Because it is. It might click some day, but it takes a lot of practice! You have to sit down and write code. A LOT! Don't skip any homework. Write and practice as much code as possible.\n\nBut I also have to ask: What kind of CS MASTERS needs to give an intro to PYTHON? That's nuts! How did you even get into the masters without a CS bachelor?",

Flask lets you make a simple website to view and edit data, and SQLite can store everything in a single file. You will need a backup plan for the database, but it's simple and doesn't require a server.\n\nIf multiple people need access at the same time, you will need a server and a proper database. Node.js lets you run JavaScript on the server to handle multiple users. A NoSQL database like MongoDB is easier than SQL for beginners because you don't have to plan tables and relationships in advance. You can just add new fields as you go (Useful if they later need to add random stuff they forgot to mention). An online database just means the database lives on a server everyone can access, but it requires hosting, security, and backups. There are generous free tiers but it adds complexity.\n\nFor now, start small with Flask and SQLite on your own computer as a demo. Focus on the key features, tracking animals, medications, and volunteer logs. Once it works, you can think about scaling it with Node.js and MongoDB if more people need access or using something like Pymongo to keep using your Flask app instead of redoing it in Node.js.\n\nWhat you are building is a basic CRUD app with a form to add new animals and a table to view them. It's simple enough that an AI could probably build it for you. If you want to learn, use AI as a tutor or guide so you don't get lost. Keep it simple. Adding too many features will make it take longer to finish and harder to maintain later.",

A country suffices. \n\nFrom a central EU and USA perspective: \n\nA degree is not 100% necessary, but makes the entire process of finding and keeping (good) jobs a lot easier. If you want to go this route, taking all general STEM classes you can get before will help. \n\nA computer science degree will generally give you good basics, but you will be expected to \"self learn\" programming along the way. You will probably get taught the basics for programming as well, but everything beyond that is incidental. Programming is to computer science as masonry to an architect. This is the slowest route, but you will be the most well rounded, and able to go into basically any field (inside of IT) you want to specialize in. \n\nA software engineering degree locks you out of very few things: Theoretical CS research is the only thing that comes to mind, but I am sure there is a little more. It mostly has the same basics as a general computer science degree, but you specialize in how software works, is made and programming a lot more. Theoretical CS and other possible specializations, like Bio/medicine and programming, physics or IT-security will be ignored more. If you know that you want to be a programmer, this is always solid. \n\nIn some countries you also have vocational training as a programmer, you can treat this like a Software Engineering degree, but shorter and with less prestige. \n\nThen you can go the self taught route. Here it's even more about a good portfolio, to prove oyu are able to work, and good networking. You need connections to get anywhere, because you need to give people a reason to even consider you an option. Normally the degree does that for you (to an extend, networking is also important if you have one) \n\nCertificates are motly completely useless in my experience. This will vary greatly throughout different regions and specific fields, but when we did technical evaluations of new candidates, we just ignored any certificates. The only thing we looked at was education and prior experience, like a portfolio or earlier jobs they've had. I know now, that in some countries they hold quite a bit more value, and that's why it's important to say where (approximately) you will be looking for work, once your education is done. \n\nIf you want to know where to start for self learning, there is a quite well written FAQ section in this subreddit (right hand side of your screen on PC, you will find it on mobile as well) with a list of places to start, very well laid out and explained",

One of the best ways to keep motivation in my opinion is building something that solves a problem you have, because the drive to solve a problem is what makes programming so insanely addictive and fun. Solving a problem you have is the most rewarding and motivational thing I've ever experienced programming. So, try it out, don't wait for motivation just think of something that annoys you and build a solution. For example, I didn't like having to go to so many different sites to compress and convert different file formats so I made my own website that converts and compresses audios, videos and images in one simple place and that is one of my favorite projects because it really showed me that motivation doesn't come from waiting around or watching courses, but from solving problems, coming up with something to make and making it.\n\nStay consistent by practicing and by making mistakes, keep yourself in that loop of frustrated about why your code isn't running but then you figure it out and you're really happy, that loop of dopamine will make learning fun and addictive for you. And when learning and problem solving becomes addictive that's when you start building the software you dream of building, because you start to realize that nothing is too difficult you just have to put in more work.",

A template engine can allow one HTML fragment to include others, and it can also allow more dynamic substitutions. Many beginners use Python along with the lightweight Flask web framework, which uses the Jinja template engine.\n\nIf you're dedicated to using Java, you can use servlets and JSP pages (kind of old school) or you can go with a more modern framework like Spring, which supports a variety of template engines.\n\nIf you want to use client-side rendering with JavaScript, you once again have lots of options: React, Angular, Svelte, Vue, ...",

That way, the code actually does something visible, which keeps it engaging.   \n  \nFor resources, Codecademy’s C++ track has short, interactive lessons and mini projects, not free, but the interactive style is easy to follow.   \n  \nYouTube also has tons of free mini-game tutorials where you can follow along and build small projects.   \n  \nCS50’s Introduction to Computer Science isn’t C++ only, but its problem sets include games and are very project-based, plus it’s hands-on and video-driven. Building your own small projects every week or two also helps you learn syntax, loops, conditionals, OOP, and more in a way that text-heavy tutorials never do.   \n  \nThe key is to alternate between learning a concept and immediately applying it in a tiny project, so you get a progressive experience without drowning in text.",

Every single failure teaches you something. It teaches you how not to do things, which is equally important to knowing how to do things. Also, it improves your experience.\n+ *Is it fear of inadequacy?* - Well, we all were there at some point in our learning.\n\nJust think about some small project and build it. If it doesn't work, figure out why and how to fix it. This is the best way to learn.\n\nDon't look at others' scripts/skills - they have way, way more experience than you have. Once you get the amount of experience, you'll also be there.\n\nYou need to gradually level up your skills through projects where you start small and simple and ramp up complexity and scope. There is no other way. \n\nNot a single programmer was *born competent, or even decent*. They all worked hard to learn.\n\nThere is no reason for fear. This is completely irrational.\n\n----\n\nYou already have a project in mind:\n\n> generating a list of pin names for input and output of a design once i feed it through an excel file for example....\n\nOkay, let's take a look at this:\n\n+ You need an Excel file - so, you need something that can *read* excel - for Python, this would be something like OpenPyXL - check it and check the documentation\n+ You need to do something with the file - that means loops conditionals, variable assignments, maybe string manipulation, etc. All things that you know already - you just need to combine them\n+ You need to output the generated new data - in what format? Text file? CSV? JSON? Excel? - depending on that, you need different tools - research them.\n\nThe whole thing starts by formulating your requirements. The more detailed you formulate them, the better.\n\nThen, break the large idea down into small units - open the file, read a line - process a line - write the output - repeat until there are no more lines\n\nThat's way too coarse - further breakdown is necessary - open and read are okay(ish) - processing needs much deeper drilling into - since you haven't told what you need to do with the data and in what format the original data is, this is up to you to figure out - last writing to file is also okay(ish).\n\nGo deeper and deeper - break things down, rinse and repeat.\n\nOnly if you do that, you will get a deep understanding of what you even want/have to do.\n\nThen, start working on implementing your parts - one after the other.\n\n---\n\nGood luck!",

So we do countless design reviews and iterations making sure all of the components are connected properly and you have pull ups and pull downs on all the right lines, and your capacitors on your voltage lines are the right size and all that and that mentality translates to coding for me a bit at first.\n\nThrow all that out the window when you’re writing scripts. Figure out what you need to build at a component level, just the logical flow of things and then build those out and test them as quickly as possible. If it runs awesome, if not,  Google is your friend. Then plug those pieces in together. You really have to get into the rapid prototyping mindset. Think of coding like building the circuit with a bread board. If you plug it in wrong, you can rip it all out and do it different.

Than this other game they didn't develop where they didn't have that loading screen constraint? How can you compare the two? How can anyone not in bad faith be affirmative that the current game is better than this other game they didn't develop without constraints?   \nI know you didn't come up with these examples, that they come from people looking for stuff to analyze and make content out of. But they are just bad generalizations.  \n\nIn any projects, you have constraints, and your goal is do the best thing possible despoite those constraints. And sometimes, being creative with those constraints helps a lot in doing that. but people don't intentionally self-inflict contraints when they want to do a product.  \n\nIt can however be a nice way to spark creativity or to develop one's skill by forcing oneself to do something differnetly than how they were doing it. I'm thinking of game jams (to stay in the realm of video games examples), where the goal is specifically to add two massive constraints (time and a custom directive) in order to force developers to be creative. The goal of these games is not to be products, even though some of them end up being great base ideas that later get expanded into full games.",

This is a static table of function pointers - each abstract class and derived class has it's own table. Your instance points to its table.\n\nSo then, if you have a `B` instance, but through type erasure you only have an `A` pointer, then calling a method will undergo a lookup so the correct implementation is called.\n\nMaybe.\n\nThe vtable only contains entries for `virtual` methods. In your example, the only entry in the vtable of both `A` and `B` will be for `print`. You didn't make `~A` virtual, so when you `delete a`, the compiler doesn't know `a` is pointing to a `B`. The compiler only knows the non-virtual interface presented to it through the `A` type.\n\n---\n\nIf you google OOP in C, you can find tutorials for building objects in C, including modeling inheritance, and polymorphism. The object code generated by this exercise typically matches the C++ equivalent exactly. The first C++ compiler - CFront, was originally a transpiler to C.\n\nSo why not just use C? Because the two languages have different type systems. C++ grants you much more type safety - and type safety is more than just catching errors; compilers are theorem provers, and they use type information in order to optimize more aggressively. C and C++ are both high level abstract languages, they're not high level assembly languages. It's not about what machine code they generate.",

If you know that you will never extend the class or you know that it will never be destroyed via a base class pointer, then maybe not.

Why are you even studying computer sciences?\n\nPerhaps try to (re)define your goals and decide based on that if you should keep going or if you should give up.\n\nYou were born too late to deal with programming? So, the progress has stopped and no updates, no new libraries, no new technologies will come any more? Who do you think is making all these updates to your apps, improving the AI that you are so much worried about, creating new systems and maintaining the existing ones? How come exactly you were born too late?\n\nIn terms of something being useless or not, have you tried to assess the current market, if it is being used or if it is useless? It takes exactly few seconds to write \"DSA use in 2025\" or \"Python jobs in 2025\". You are not proving/disproving these worries and claims and remaining in your own darkness.\n\nIn terms of competitive programming, it is not as important. Better care about hackathons. And for both, what will realistically happen when you start doing these NOW? Right now when you start doing competitive programming, what will happen? You'll be last in the rankings? But will you gain absolutely nothing from it? No new experience, no new knowledge, no new skills? What will happen when you join the next upcoming hackathon? Realistically, what will happen? You won't get anything done? You'll place last? Your stuff does not work? Your stuff will be basic? But even that will be a position to gain new information from. You'll learn where are you and you'll learn what else you can improve in yourself. And at best, you get something done and do not land last in the ranking.\n\nAnd about memorizing stuff then computer sciences is not just about memorizing stuff but about that information into a practice. You sit in lectures -> try to do something practical after that and use that new knowledge. You learn a new technology -> start using that new technology. It is all about practicing what you are learning.\n\nYou are worried about the AI. Who stops you from hopping on the AI train? Learn to use it (not learn to rely on it blindly). Free AI tools are there. It takes just few Youtube videos to see how to use one or another tool. You can allocate one weekend on learning to use an AI and already you'll know more and you'll be more experienced than prior to that weekend.\n\nHopelessness will not change anything. Start taking real actions. Stop worrying about \"what if\"-s. Either you do things or you do not.",

I'm also using MacOS adn relying on CI jobs running on Linux, even for cross-platform stuff.\n\n  \nAs for versioning, I've gone from CVS, to SVN, to Perforce, to Git, trying Hg along the way.

        "body": "Yes, it is overwhelming. C++ is more complex for multiple reasons:\n\n* It's relatively old as far as programming languages go, it dates back to the 1990s. It predates all modern build tools and package managers.\n* One of the primary reasons people pick C++ is to build platform-specific code. Not the only reason! But it means that a standard cross-platform solution for writing C++ just doesn't make a lot of sense for many people is because the whole reason C++ is being used is to build code that's tightly tied to a particular operating system a lot of the time.\n* There are multiple widely used C++ compilers: GCC/G++, LLVM/Clang++, and MSVC are all extremely widely used and relevant. They're quite compatible but not perfectly compatible. Some important projects can't be compiled with all of them. They don't support the same set of platforms.\n* Due to the lack of strong cross-platform IDEs, many C++ projects support command-line builds as their primary solution. IDEs can still be used, but they're not primary.\n\nAs far as advice: first, I'm assuming that you want to learn C++ as a pure language and that none of the stuff you want to learn is platform-specific. In other words, I'm assuming that your goal is NOT to, e.g. write a Windows GUI application. If so, then you need to specify what types of platform-specific code you want to write, because the advice might be different.\n\nSo if you just want to learn C++ as a pure language, you've got a lot of options. Which one you prefer is really a matter of personal preference.\n\nIf you use Windows as your primary system now and you want to keep doing that, Microsoft's Visual Studio (e.g. Community edition) is an excellent choice. It's full-featured and \"batteries included\". Not the same as VS Code, which is a totally different product.\n\nAnother good option on Windows is to install WSL2 and use a fully open-source toolchain: use your text editor of choice, install gcc, cmake, and a bunch of command-line tools used on Linux.\n\nOf course, if you're interested in Linux, that's a great choice too. I don't think it really matters which distro you pick. On Linux, every developer tool you could possibly imagine can be installed with one or two clicks or a single command. You can go from a fresh install to a working developer environment in literally minutes, compared to hours on Windows.\n\nThe downside of Linux is that you might be much less familiar with the GUI, and it might not support all of the games, apps, and hardware that Windows does.\n\nIf you have a Mac, macOS is fantastic - it gives you nearly all of the developer tools you'll find on Linux, plus all of the other sorts of apps you need for everything else in your life like on Windows (and unlike Linux). As a foundation you can use gcc or clang, plus cmake, and then optionally use various code editors combined with command-line for building and running. Yet another option is Xcode, Apple's IDE. While Xcode is primarily used for Apple's languages and to build apps for Apple platforms, it does have C++ support.\n\nOne option is VS Code, which works on all of those platforms. However, I wouldn't recommend it as a good starting point for C++. VS Code is NOT a \"batteries included\" solution, it's a blank slate and you have to install plug-ins and configure everything to support any language you want. Some languages are easy. C++ is not, if you're new to it. You basically need to already have a compiler and build system installed and working, AND you need to understand how to configure and troubleshoot it, to get it working with VS Code.\n\nHope that helps.",

You still need a compiler, linker, debugger, build system, and standard libraries, AND you'd have to configure them...\n\nSo in VS, you'd use the wizard to configure a new, blank Win32 Console Application. In the Solution Explorer window, you'd right-click and add a source file, and you're off to the races...\n\nIf you're on Linux, that'll likely be some `dev-tools` package - and it's PROBABLY NAMED `dev-tools`, and then that'll get you `GCC` and `make` and all the basics you need. Then you can pick whatever editor you want. I agree it's a little bit too much freedom to begin with. I like Vim + You Complete Me, but you would probably find that modal terminal editor to be archaic with a near vertical learning curve, but it's often preferred by advanced developers. Your editor is NOT C++, so don't get bogged down in it. Learn some programming first, and then at some point, once you work through your programming book, then you might consider working on your workflow, which means experimenting with tools. Vim is scriptable, and that includes the host command shell directly - so you can extend your local editing to span not just the local system, but the whole of the internet and all it has to offer you, if it made sense to do so.",

A 90 minute take home, a virtual technical, and a virtual behavioral. Only their final rounds are in-person.\n\nThat said, I definitely expected this. Just like companies work arrangements are mostly going back to how they were pre-covid with hybrid being the most common, followed by 100% onsite, followed by remote being the most rare. Interviews are the same way. In-person worked. Not only is it a way to prevent cheating, but it's significantly easier to read body language, and to get a better vibe of a person (in *both* directions, this benefits the candidate to judge the interviewers) when you're in-person.\n\nIt's also not that expensive for the company. The final round can be expensive-ish to fly people in, like Google's doing here. But pre-covid something that was common before the final rounds was to have candidates early in the process drive out to a proctored test site to do their \"interview\" there. There's thousands upon thousands of test centers *globally*, you just drive out ot one near you. I've done it before, it was pretty easy. Local proctored testing is very cheap.\n\nI think this was inevitable. The rise of AI just sped things along a bit.\n\nAnd to those who haven't done in-person interviews before, it's ***way*** easier to whiteboard out a problem in pseudocode and another person in the room, versus doing it in a real IDE via typing where all your syntax needs to be right with people staring at you on camera.",

The same people now with AI think that they can make everything and are probably totally obsessed with that, and they think that they will \"catch the train\" and replace \"old-school\" software developers who don't \"utilize all AI potentials\". \n\nBoth of these factors lead to a situation where you jave toxic environment both in companies and in industry as well, and that's the reason why I'm also thinking about changing the company or career at all.",

There’s a huge gap between the skills companies actually need and the number of people already trained and looking for work. So you end up with fewer openings and way too many applicants, and let’s not even talk about how low the salaries companies are offering these days. It’s not just tech either, people are getting degrees in fields like anthropology or psychology, and unless they go all the way to a PhD, they’re stuck in an endless loop of not having enough experience. The good thing is your degree is still super relevant to today’s needs.\n\nI think you should get your resume in front of as many people as possible. Find companies in your area where you’d actually like to work and reach out to people in the departments you’re interested in. Tell them your situation, ask if they know of any openings, and see if they’re willing to help or give some guidance. It’s not a guaranteed solution, but it really does increase your chances. If you’re open to remote work, check out [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/); it shares a simple but effective way to send your resume to hundreds of companies.\n\nAnd don’t forget, all the jobs you’ve done to get by still matter. Every bit of work experience teaches discipline, problem-solving, and perseverance. Those things count more than you think. Keep moving forward and use everything you’ve learned so far to your advantage.",

It's not worth it to suffer through a semester where you're not learning anything.\n\n\nThe good news is that there's no end of supplemental resources you can find for whatever topic you're studying. If you can't understand your professor, it's definitely an unfortunate waste of time to be in lecture, but as long as you know what skills you're supposed to be developing you can get there on your own.\n\n\nAlso, some of those professors are better in office hours. I can zone out to the lecture of someone who's hard to understand, but if it's 1:1, they have to go at your pace, so you can have them repeat or rephrase until you're satisfied.",

All jobs were \"desirable\" jobs and companies. Sorry for being a bit vague, I keep the personal details vague on reddit.\n\nI learned two lessons from the search. First of all, make sure to keep in touch with your network, especially the people you did great work with in the past. Not all stretches of your career will have you working with people you click with and on projects that succeed, but the stretches that do are where your real network comes from.\n\nSecond, make sure to study system design interviews. They've become performance theater at this point like LeetCode and you're expected to \"know the moves\" at some places. Most staff+ interviews also had a project presentation and Q&A part which paradoxically is the opposite where you're cooked if you never had the scope and scars but you don't need to study for. Also expect newer companies to ask more non-memorizable-from-internet coding and system design questions, which IMO is a great thing because that'll probably trickle to the rest of the industry eventually.\n\nThe above is for ICs who are still hands on. The market seems to be rough for pure engineering management roles unless your previous team was a strong match for the role.",

So, in all, not that bad, but very frustrating and time consuming. Back then Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft had all just laid off 10K employees that week each, so it was impossible for anyone to get a new FAANG offer.\n\nIt’s difficult, but keep trying and work hard - I have faith good things will come :)",

We're happy with the amount we're being paid to do engineering work. There's a very, very, very long IC track that goes very high up the \"strategic\" chain that pays extremely well. Senior, Staff, Principal SWE's, Architects, etc are all making very technical decisions at the team/company level. They are very strategic. They help the business achieve their goals through *technical strategy*.\n\nMost of us don't want to \"run the country\", or go into management, or go into any sort of non-technical role.\n\nWe're doing what we love, and we're being paid very well for it. I've been asked if moving down the management track was something I was interested in several times, my management could've made it happen overnight. I declined. Pretty sure every SWE I personally know that has dipped their toes in the management-waters has reverted back to being a SWE because they hated it.\n\nThe SWE's that don't fit into the stereotype of rigid, socially awkward nerds lacking critical thinking skills have an extremely easy path into management over here in the West. They, again, just don't want to.\n\nSo let me spin your own question back at you. Why do so many engineers and scientists in the east pivot *out* of their technical career track and go into political/management roles where they stop doing the work they supposedly loved doing?\n\nThat's very strange to me as someone in the West.

So when something breaks you just ask your boss how to fix it. Repeat that every day for a few years and pretty soon the newer people will be asking you how to fix it. You can try to write docs but they usually go out of date and are hard to find stuff in. Also some people intentionally avoid writing docs to give themselves job security. \n\nIn the end you’ll become a “Meta engineer”, ie an expert in whatever custom tooling Meta has built. The highest performers will simply be the people who have been there the longest and absorbed all of the internal knowledge. A new joiner, even if they’re really smart, will not be able to do anything except ask their boss how to fix stuff for many months.",

I learned a whole, whole lot, though mostly on my own in terms of technical stuff, but a lot on the business side from being in such a small and early company.\n\n\nIt's not for everyone, but contrary to most other comments, I see it as a great opportunity because instead of sitting down and trying to figure out a project to work on to practice, learn, and solve problems, which is hard, you actually have that part taken care of. You're also basically on the weeds immediately of figuring out things like cross-functional communication and collaboration, prioritization of value generation vs maintainability based on expected impact and necessity, autonomy and ownership etc...\n\n\nHence, why its the \"senior junior\" situation. You speed run learning some senior skills while potentially missing out on some of the more mid-level things like adhering to team styling, some knowledge gaps that come from needing to ship and not having the time or team for learning more about developing in a mature project, learning about choosing when to apply design patterns etc...\n\n\nThose things tend to come about from a bit slower of a pace where engineers can be deeper on engineering rather than making sure market fit has been established, runway is secured, and good enough is more important than scaling and maintaining due to the rapid nature of changing demands.\n\n\nBut, as I said, that isn't for everyone which is okay. It also qualifies you much more towards startups/early/growth since the dynamics and environment, as well as associated skills and knowledge, aren't the same as more matured process and product. So it can be a little harder when trying to transition to something else, but I think its excellent experience to have.\n\n\nI feel like it may be easier to go from startup to mid+ than the other way around. Just my thoughts.",

What I would do in that situation instead of waiting is, reach out to that team you are waiting on, ask if they can at least agree on the structure of the JSON. Then vibe code a fake API so you can build out your front end. \n\nBasically find any way you can to move forward without “waiting”. Even if you have to make changes later, you will be better off and look more proactive.\n\nThat’s my advice",

If you want to be valuable to the team, you have to show growth in ways that the team values, not just what you deem valuable. \n\nOn the other hand, if you can't do that, and feel strongly that you know what is valuable better than anyone else, that's the spirit that drives entrepreneurs. Your path to a good boss might be becoming your own, but you better be able to sell your authority as the guy who knows to clients, and understand what they find valuable.",

Raw technical skill is like maybe 50% of it. At the end of the day in business a huge portion of success is being able to convince people that your opinions are correct and being able to drive new projects, architecture changes, etc. \n\nYou can be the best programmer in the world but if you suck at communicating your leverage is basically limited to what you can produce with your own 2 hands. When you can communicate goals and influence the direction of projects / the company your leverage is much higher. The people who are great at communicating and getting their voices heard are often not the same people with the best technical skills. \n\nThis means that success is a noisy process where\nsometimes really talented people are limited because they can’t leverage they talent, and sometimes people succeed with faulty ideas based on a lack of technical knowledge and talent. \n\nDon’t forget that luck and personal connections also play a major role. \n\nWhat this means for engineers practically:\nThe attitude that a lot of engineers adopt that “PMs and managers are all just overpaid idiots who don’t deserve their paychecks” is cute and cathartic and everything. But it’s ultimately self defeating. At the end of the day, you’re going to trade a significant portion of the hours of your life for money to succeed. I have things outside of work (family, etc.) that I care about, so if I’m going to trade my time for money that equation better damn well be stacked in my favor. \n\nIf that means that I have to play stupid corporate games sometimes, then fine. Spinning myself over the unfairness of it all is just a waste of my time and energy. \n\nNot to mention that I’ve also reached a point in my career where I’ve realized that good PMs and managers can also play a role where they produce a ton of legitimate value that is difficult for engineers with their heads down on implementation to realize.",

My growth to senior was a bit slower, but that's often more a result of what projects and mentoring you get. Unfortunately, a lot of teams will have one, singular FEE.

I have never had a problem getting interviews.\n\n2. Not all recognizable brands are good. Accenture's reputation is that they select for conformity, not skill.\n\n3. AI will have a massive shift soon. Pretty much everyone noticed by now that there have been several trillion dollars invested into AI by now, so there will now have to be a few trillion dollars in revenue, soon, or investors will pull the plug. It won't be entirely dead, but completely different.\n\n4. Employment laws and expectations in Japan and Europe are different. My expectation is that when the bottom drops out from the current AI boom, Accenture will focus on retraining you, and you may end up doing something completely different, but you will still have a job, while a mid-sized company may lay off people more quickly, but on the upside, you then already have a visa.\n\nSo basically, if your plan is to leave Japan, and your main skillset is AI related, the \"leave now\" option is likely better. Amsterdam is also a good place to start, the next opportunity might be in Berlin, which is also a nice city but much more of a culture shock, and more depressing in winter.",

I think in most cases management does not even know what \"quality code\" looks like and just relies on SWEs to do their job.  Now SWE \"talent\" comes in to play and most companies are not hiring big tech company level SWEs since they cannot compete with total compensation.\n\nI've worked on safety critical medical devices at private non-tech companies in non-tech cities, think dialysis machines, for my 15+ year career.   These companies have mature processes as they have been around for 30+ years. The devices we created were safe and had FDA approval, but the codebase was real spaghetti in many areas.\n\nMost of the time it came down to SWEs just working within the existing code base.  They don't really care about pushing for refactors unless it was absolutely necessary.  SWEs were not intentionally sabotaging the project.  They did the best they could with the skills they had.  Management doesn't complain about code quality so there is no issue from these SWEs perspective.\n\nThe SWEs at the majority of companies are not grinding DS&A or design patterns trying to get in to top tech companies.  They can code up features that do what they need to do and that's about it.  These companies are not trying to compete with big tech companies as they cannot come close to matching total compensation.\n\nThey try to sell themselves to SWEs in different ways, but it just attracts SWEs that:  (off the top of my head)\n\n* don't know the value of their talent\n* meet the companies bar, but would not be talented enough to get in to big tech companies for big pay\n* late in their career where they are financially secure to coast in a job\n\nSo this is a long way of saying, yes it's pretty common in the industry to have production ready code that is poorly designed.  I would even wager that is the expectation and not the expectation when you look at the industry at large and not a small slice like only big tech companies. \n\nI'd bet even if you went to look at some codebase at google there would be SWEs that say this is poorly designed we need to refactor.  Most of the time the refactor is now worth it and as a SWE you take it as a lesson learned for the next time you do the same or similar thing.",

Pay is meh but still good.\n\nThe low stress gives me time to focus on projects outside of work.\n\nEdit: I went to a no name school and have a BA for computer science so I’m fairly happy with where I’m at. Hope to get a masters in the coming years from a better school and we’ll see where that brings me.",

Maybe a few thousand if you compare it to eating out / doordashing. When you're already looking at $200k+ TC, a few thousand dollars in free food shouldn't even be a blip on your radar. That, and I prefer bringing my own meals in to the office, even when there's free food. You'll get sick of the free food eventually.\n\nThat said, all we can really answer is based on our own personal priorities.... For me, WLB is my #1 priority in my career. Significantly above everything else, including salary.\n\nSo on that alone, #1 isn't even an option for me.\n\nI'm not sure #2 sounds all that appealing to me either... cause I agree with you, being at a hybrid/onsite place as a new grad is really valuable.

If you keep discouraging yourself like this then you will end up like one of those adults who only talk about their glory days back in hs. \n\n\nThose people saying better opportunities happen are correct. It can happen and far more frequently. Getting married to an old and obviously shit ideology will never help. Keep your head high and senses alert to find your opportunities. \n\n\nAlthough anecdotal, I always thought working at Google would be my dream job and the last place I work before retiring.

Instead I found a new opportunity that is far better in every aspect quite literally and I just stumbled on it by accident. \n\n\nIt is one of the harder industries to break into and I found the easy way in by luck.

In concept if you keep a well maintained and organized code base that is organized and indexed properly your agents will work well on them for good. Once they get bloated and difficult to read the agents use will slow down. They’re just like real people in that sense. If you let them deploy constant sprawl they’ll trip themselves up in the context and lose utility. \n\nAsking them to touch external services from a main pipeline is incredibly simple and as long as the code is organized they shouldn’t have any issues doing that. If you’re talking 10s of thousands of lines of inconsistent cross references across services and projects that’s a whole other story.",

May seem like a lot but it’s better than pretending to know. \n\nI’d recommend making a documentation of some kind on the codebase and being diligent in recording each step taken when doing a task. Then you can refer back to your notes and eventually it starts to paint an overall picture of the code base you are working on. \n\nFor example start by creating notes on the files in the code base you are most familiar with and then move on from there. Can even be 2-3 sentences if you don’t fully know - Auth.ts “This code deals with the security of client.” \n\nEventually with good documentation will help clear things up, good luck!",

This confidence comes from several sources depending on your environment and your team/org structure:\n\n1. Knowing who knows what. At large companies with lots of knowledge silos, this is probably the most important bit. Most likely, the unfamiliar bits of the codebase is also owned by them, so if you need to make changes there, you'd have to get their buy-in anyways\n2. Knowing how to find what you're looking for - both in terms of the codebase tooling (e.g. if you guys have a bespoke code search or repo management layer) as well as a high-level idea of how things are generally organized (and this usually goes back to #1) and how to trace through the difference packages, as well as relevant documents or memos that have documented relevant design discussions and decisions\n3. Having the (un)earned confidence that things will go well - I actually think this is the most important aspect. Most of the time, it's easier to just assume that you'll find what you're looking for and not fret too much about the task. This comes with time, and I find that not stressing out about unknowns is just as important as being competent in the domains you do know.",

Others have everyone fending for themselves. You need to try to figure out which one the company you're talking to is. Another problem is if they're a smaller company, they might have fewer clients. Find out how many clients they have and the nature of their contracts. I worked at a contracting company that tried to present themselves as a consulting company. They had two clients when I interviewed, but then lost one between when I accepted the offer and started. They eventually lost their last client and had some layoffs along with a bunch of people leaving to join the company that took over the contract. \n\nAnother challenge, like with any company, is how much the interviewers actually lie to you or not. For example, I was told during my interviews the contract was for three years. It was actually three 1-year options, so they had to be renewed each year. \n\nTry to get an idea if they're really doing consulting work or they are more staffing/contracting. Especially with less experience, you'll probably be doing more development work. Normally, the higher you are in a company, the more they want you to be doing sales. You also want to get an idea of how they get new projects, and what their project pipeline looks like.",

They're not stupid. They know someone with a masters degree is just going to use that \"normal\" position as a stepping stone, and leave the moment they have a job lined up that has work utilizing their degree, and more importantly, pay reflecting the advanced degree.\n\nYou can claim that this is the job you want, and you're in it for the long term all you want.... but no sane company is going to believe you.\n\nNone of this is a problem if you're getting a masters/PhD in order to chase jobs that require a masters/PhD. It becomes a problem when you're using those degrees just to delay your entry into the market.\n\nStick it out with applying. Getting an internship sophomore year is pretty difficult. You'll likely have better luck after your Junior year. And even if you don't.... in my opinion your time is better spent in the market, applying until you get something lined up.

Many people build careers through certifications, strong portfolios, internships, and practical experience. What matters most is demonstrating that you can solve problems, learn quickly, and contribute.\n\nIf you enjoy programming, it’s worth thinking about ways to keep doing it without burning out. That could mean continuing your degree at a slower pace, taking a break, or focusing on building projects and internships that align with your goals. Leadership and managerial roles come later, and they often care more about results and experience than the exact degree.\n\nHonestly, there’s no perfect answer. Try weighing what will keep you motivated and learning while protecting your well-being. Even switching to a more flexible path can get you where you want without feeling trapped or behind.\n\nYou’re not “less than” anyone without a degree, what matters is what you DO with your skills and opportunities.",

If you talk to stakeholders about what's on their mind, or just ask them cool questions. You need to be friendly enough, but you're probably coming across as aloof. You don't need to be best friends by any stretch. \n\nRe: leaving a lot of comments on code reviews\n\nMaybe you're coming across as dick in them. If formatting is a mess, push for auto-formatting (bog standard). There's various friendly and supportive ways you can frame the questions, I frankly doubt you're coming across well.\n\nRe: Being judgemental or rude. \n\nIt sounds like you really feel like you can't escalate problems while not being a dick about it?",

You arent expected to know much your first 6-12 months but at a certain point you wont be the youngest or newest person in the room so make sure you grow by then. You never know when they will start asking you questions and expect you know the answer to. \n\n\\- Ive started to use AI in my work and honestly it's really nie to understand the codebase. Use it as a pair programming tool. But dont rely on it too heavily. Make sure you understand what it's trying to convey. I have founda. few errors or things that the AI overlooks. I.e. I was trying to create a new print statement andasked the AI to go through it as it was a new field and needed to touch like 10 files. When i tested it, it wasnt working and i realized that at no point did the AI ever make sure that all the cases were covered because there was one case that would never hit because we never set that variable.\n\n\\- Ask questions and try to befriend older engineers. This is key. It's scary but you gotta play the game. The game isnt always getting as much out there, it's how your coworkers speak of you. Many jr engineers will twiddle their thumbs, SWEs hate that. Dont twiddle your thumbs, if you are stuck ask anybody. In stand up say, I am stuck. It goes a long way when you can say that openly.\n\n\\- when you complete something, show proof of it. Ask for 15 minutes post stand up to display in front of team. The team will lvoe that. \n\n\\-if you have a mentor, use that person but also try to cut the cord as quickly as you can. Ive seen jr engineers kind of cling to the mentor andwhenver they get stuck they just wait for the mentor to come back rom their 3 hour meeting even when they know where to go to but are too afraid of going themselves.",

        "body": "I started out as a FE dev and became a BE dev. Now I don't even want to touch anything FE, although I'm technically full-stack I'd only write BE on my resume. Backend code is always much cleaner, simpler, and easier to debug - but it requires knowledge of certain things you don't often think about as a FE dev.\n\nHere are my 2-cents of everything you need to know to be a GOOD BE dev.\n\nFirst of all, you need a general understanding of the internet itself. How it works, and why it is the way it is. You need to know what HTTP requests are and how they work. A BE dev is not a network engineer, but you still want to know what ports are, what UDP and TCP is. All BE development establishes connections to someone or something (most often databases, but depending on the product it could be establishing connections peer to peer or in any other way)\n\nAfter that, you need to understand that backend code is not like FE code. The same design and architectural patterns don't make sense. It helps to think of BE code as a series of completely isolated scripts that a computer will be processing. It doesn't run on a client, it's not available to a client, users have no idea what that code is and they will never see it or directly interact with it. In the simplest context, think of a simple user registration form. The frontend has some inputs it captures, and then it sends it to the backend for processing. The backend then does all of the work to make that registration actually happen with those inputs - which is most often inserting rows to the database.\n\nYou need to understand and be able to work with databases, you need to be able to read and write SQL. I can't think of any BE position where the code is not interacting with a database. In many instances, that's ALL the code is doing - interacting with a database.\n\nYou need to understand and be able to manage remote servers and web servers. Familiarity with unix.\n\nSecurity is a concern in BE development for sure, but generally common sense will go a long way and people often think some kind of over-engineering is required to have something secure. Have a properly secured server, with correctly set-up file permissions, whitelists, and firewalls. Don't set anything public that shouldn't be public. Don't store files or sensitive data in weird places. Don't store sensitive data like passwords in plain text. Don't install random packages and libraries that you're not 100% confident in and have a genuine use-case for. Don't work out of a system or computer that's potentially compromised. All validation must be properly handled in the backend, what the FE does is irrelevant in terms of security. Don't have any method someone could exploit to fire off code or SQL on your system. Use services like Cloudflare to help with spam reduction and bot detection. Keep all software/packages regularly updated (including the OS the server is on), and finally keep logs of everything including errors, accesses, requests, etc. Regardless of the scale of a product or application, if all of the above are met, the product will be completely secure from a BE perspective.\n\nOverall, I'd say there is a lot more power with backend development than there is with FE. There are more job opportunities for it, and there are just more things you can do in general. The code you write is not just something to be used exclusively for a client's UI - it can be used for quite literally anything, from the world's most complex sorting and filtering algorithms to data analytics to machine learning to whatever else. Lastly, I'd say the beauty of backend code is once it's written, it's made to last forever as long as the computer running it is still on. It's not subject to the change of forever-changing things like clients, npm packages, and designs. In other words, if someone wrote the backend script for a user registration form in 1990, it would be just as valid code as one made today.",

I joke to my coworkers that we’re all just data plumbers.\n\n\nHave you done system design interviews? That will honestly cover 80% of what you need to know for BE stuff, and every cloud host has their own version of the sys design components that you’ll study. The rest is LLD (which you likely already have experience with), dev ops if needed, and testing.",

If you want to specialize in the creative side of things you'll need to work on developing more advanced technical skills such as graphics/shader programming, webGPU/webGL, Three.js, and etc. to distinguish yourself. \n\nI believe the general industry title for such roles is \"creative developer\" - basically a developer with a focus on the areas I mentioned alongside all the existing requirements of a frontend developer. Demand for this skill set is infrequent - most projects that involve this kind of work are usually advertising/marketing related and are typically contracted to web design agencies or freelancers in the field. On rare occasions larger companies may selectively recruit a few of these roles but career-wise I don't think it's very viable long term unless you have the right connections and can distinguish yourself with a strong portfolio.\n\nI personally think working as a regular frontend developer is a much more preferable position to be in in terms of career progression and compensation. That being said however if you're passionate about this then you should continue to pursue it inside and outside of work whenever you can - often times in your career you'll stumble upon opportune moments, so having the right skill set at the right time can definitely lead you down a desirable path!",

High level knowledge of any SSR framework will be utilized more and is generally in greater demand.  Most front end devs are making client apps with enterprise applications where the UX insights to be mindful of are about making it intuitive to sort through complicated workflows with lots of data.  If you know how to target those more creative roles, great, but I have had to use far less of my graphic design skills even while working on e commerce and retail platforms.  Learn what you love and interests you, but you need to balance your learning towards in demand, marketable skills earlier in your career.
