        "body": "Ways I would tackle it:\n\n1. Denormalized counters in your post record (small scale)\n\nYou add integer columns like `comments_count`, `likes_count` directly on your posts table.\n\nWhenever someone adds or removes a comment (or like), you increment/decrement that column instead of re‑scanning all comments.\n\nMost relational databases (Postgres, MySQL) can do an atomic `UPDATE posts SET comments_count = comments_count + 1 WHERE id = ?` cheaply, especially when that column is in memory.\n\nThis would be my first pick given you can ship this in minutes with zero infrastructure beyond your main database.\n\n2. Sharded or distributed counters (mid scale)\n\nFor “hot” posts with millions of comments/likes - think celebrities, viral content etc., a single counter can become a write hotspot.\n\nYou break it into N shards:\n\n    UPDATE comment_counter_shards\n       SET shard_count = shard_count + 1\n     WHERE post_id = ? AND shard_id = rand_between(1, N)\n\nTo read the total, you sum over those N shards. N is tuned (often 4–16) so no single row fights over locks.\n\nThis solution pays off only when your single‑row updates actually become a bottleneck (once you hit sustained write contention). Until then its probably an overkill.\n\n3. In‑memory caching (Redis, Memcached, etc.)\n\nMaintain the “current” counts in a fast key‑value store. On each write you atomically INCR or DECR the Redis key (e.g. post:123:comments).\n\nFeed readers pull from cache, falling back to the database only if the cache miss occurs.\n\nEach 1 & 2 solutions could be combined with this method for low-latency reads.\n\nI am about to drive - lemme think of other ways, I will edit and add to this post if something else comes up.\n\nUPDATE: Some more thoughts:\n\nTo keep write latency low, counters could update asynchronously (e.g. via a message queue).\n\nYou accept sub‑second lag in the displayed count in exchange for high throughput (which for non-YMYL stuff like like/comment count is acceptable).\n\nAlso worth noting, there are specialized data stores with native counters like Cassandra and Bigtable from Google. They support atomic counter columns across distributed nodes, so you offload the complexity of sharding and locking.\n\nBut if you are at that stage and its your own service, you probably made it and I want your job :)\n\nAnyways, its weekend. Going for some mountain touge with my Miata :D Peace out ✌️\n\nP.S. I run [AI/software studio](https://famouslabs.org) and I am open for work - whether its data, MVPs or custom software. DMs open!",

You just need to define a function and output a Polars Dataframe, and Dagster does the rest. This what you built is an asset (important to understand why Dagster is different to other orchestrators).\n\nThat asset can have dependencies with other Dagster assets. And what can be an asset? dbt models, Airbyte-generated tables, etc. (anything that can materialize data in a \\[table, file, memory, etc\\] is an asset) so when you need build N-asset and its parents (because Dagster respects the order) is awesome.

        "body": "I'd say that an Inmon approach (at least originally, the man keeps evolving his ideas and publishing new books) compares better as a data architecture, much like a data mesh, more than Kimball (at least when he started, that guy kept on expanding his concepts as well).\n\nInmon's DW design favored more or less 3 data layers:\n- A raw layer, that started as a landing zone and eventually evolved to an \"operational data store\". Originally is way quite simple, but an ODS was supposed to provide operational level reporting capabilities, with even near real-time if possible (it was quite visionary when proposed in the 90s);\n- A Data Warehouse layer, which was supposed to have a fully integrated view of the business for analytical purposes. This matched mostly his definition: \"subject-oriented, non-volatile, integrated, time-variant collection of data\". The DW layer is rarely, if ever, accessed by BI tools or end users. It is the single source of truth that feeds the specific databases (next bullet) supporting analytic and decision nerds. As such, it tends to be more normalized (not really full 3NF, but in that direction), as this would make it more reusable for different sets of requirements - including future ones.\n- Data marts: these are tightly scoped to the needs of specific use cases. For reporting and BI, it's common to model those as Kimball star schemas; for data science, other formats, even files, are possible. For specific reports, it could be a very custom thing.\n\nThis actually is the source for a medallion architecture, and also became a full data architecture before Kimball came up with the concept of a DW using \"conformed dimensions\". I built quite a few DWs using Inmon's approach, and I can tell you they evolve well and survive a lot. The main challenges are:\n- Figuring out a good priority for which domains/subjects to build first. It's no use trying to model the whole DW layer before delivering something, but people still try that.\n- Knowing how to capture a business in its entirety in a data model. Eventually, as you iterate, you'll find inconsistencies, redundancies, things no one thought about, politics, etc. Solving those to one common model is hard; letting them pass reduces the value of the DW layer over time, putting g the entire architecture in check;\n- Compound effort of having data go through 3 layers (or more) before delivering value. Again, this is people just assuming they have to adopt and build it all before any value is delivered. My approach was to first do a high level business mapping in domains to identify opportunities and prioritize. The first 2-3 deliveries usually had very light landing and a straightforward middle layer model, generating stars was straightforward, fast and cheap. As the platform grew, complexity would be added but not as a burden - it is a way to actually represent the business and deliver higher-level analytics. The kind that needs cross domain analysis, decision and optimization. Doing that on top of starts is incredibly harder (been there, done that).\n\nInmon kept evolving his design, addressing data quality, unstructured data, real-time and others, but he lost importance as the world moved to cloud and Hadoop - even though he published about those and his designs were perfectly applicable there. It's more that everything pre-cloud and pre-agile was sort of left behind by a new generation.\n\nEdit:typos",

        "body": "> orbits/predictions that would require going through the entire database more than once to establish relationships between planets/stars and calculate distances based on multiple columns and making sub queries based on the results\n\nThis aspect sounds like you want to step out of SQL for some steps, or at least generate intermediate tables. Generating a subquery based on the results of another query isn't really how CTEs work - a CTE just creates a view or 'virtual table' that you can query from. The 'going through the entire database more than once' sounds like you want to do some kind of iterative work, where you want to save the results at each step and move on.\n\nThis doesn't necessitate using a particular DB, but you might want to think about how you would approach some of these things in another language. Using Python, for instance, lets you make use of many different tools that work well together, it will let you take an imperative approach to calculating things, and you'll be able to easily write output data to files and review them using csv/jsonl/parquet formats.\n\nYou would also be able to set up long running processes to be done incrementally. Say you create a list of all systems 'A' to calculate the distance to all other systems 'B' - if this would take a long time, you can store a table with which 'A' systems have been done. Then your imperative program can just find the next 'A' system to calculate, and do the calculations for that. This sort of chunking might make processing more resilient to timeouts or memory issues.\n\n> if making multiple smaller tables with a few columns (5-10) or a single one with all columns (30-40) would be best\n\nIf you land on columnar storage like parquet, or duckdb's internal storage, then it doesn't matter how many columns you have. Their data layout means that all the data for a column is stored together, so it can completely skip over columns you don't need. The general tradeoff with columnar systems is they often make it a bit slower to pick out individual values. So if your main way of using the data is to grab out the data for a specific system, this isn't as efficient.\n\nIf you have a row-based store then you might be better served with multiple tables if you can organise columns into groups that are often used together. For example if coordinates aren't often used in conjuction with other columns, but you want to do a lot of work comparing coordinates, then you could split that off to its own table. If all the tables share the same primary key, and you make sure they are all indexed the same, it should be fine to perform joins between these tables. This is likely a relatively small optimisation, since it really just makes disk reads a bit more efficient.\n\n> The best database option that would basically be read only...\n\nThis mostly means that something based on columnar-storage will be fine. You aren't updating rows, so you don't need anything transactional. It doesn't preclude row-based systems either, so essentially everything is open to you.\n\nIf postgres is working for you, just keep it in there. That's fine.\n\nSQLite probably won't work - it doesn't have a compressed format, and you'll likely run into issues with the large data volume relative to disk size.\n\nIf most of what you are doing is running through lots of data at once, then you could convert the tables to parquet files and query with something like DuckDB, Polars, or Daft. Each of those also make it easier to script with python and exchange data from an sql processing model to an imperative one in python. Daft may have a benefit that it has a built-in method to spread execution to multiple processes on your machine, so if something goes oom it can recover and retry, and can spill intermediate steps to disk.\n\nOr, as others have mentioned, you could add an extension for duckdb to get data via postgres.\n\n---\n\nIn general, I'd leave things in postgres for now and see if you can point things like DuckDB at it, and see how their processing model works for you. Polars [can connect to a database](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.read_database.html) and [so can Daft](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/integrations/sql/). If you're going to hit OOM issues it will happen in this processing step regardless of how the data is stored, so if you try out a few different processing engines working off of the existing postgres data, you might find what works for you.\n\nIf any of these tools work for you, then you might consider shifting the data to parquet format as it may be smaller to store and more efficient to read. Every one of these can write data out to parquet ([duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/file_formats/parquet_export.html), [polars](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.LazyFrame.sink_parquet.html), [daft](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/api/dataframe/#daft.DataFrame.write_parquet).",

Postgres for sure is one of those, but for your use case you'd want an Analytic (OLAP) Database so you could use Clickhouse.\n\nDoing rankings is a typical analytic task with a window function. Establishing relationships, the full table scan part is just part and parcel of what a traditional database does but you going in and actually mapping the relationships you could use a CTE. Better yet would be something like dbt (data build tool).\n\nNow I'm not saying you'll be accessing all 225G's at once in which case *maybe*  you won't hit your 32G of system memory limit. I'm not sure queries you do plan on running. But to be on the safe side just use a traditional analytic server like Clickhouse and if it turns out that the queries you end up running don't have huge joins or aren't working with tables that are 60gigs at a time in size then you can just use DuckDB.\n\nEdit: How you end up modeling this data and what queries you run against it might be a separate issue. I think the baseline technical aspect is to get you up and running. \n\nActually one thing I hadn't considered is you can just keep running everything in Postgres since it's already in it, and then use DuckDB with the postgres extension known as pg\\_duck\n\n[https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html)",

But can pyiceberg handle two writers at the same time? \"Iceberg uses Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) which requires failed writers to retry.\", I wouldn't call that concurrent, as the writers are fighting for the resource. And if there are enough writers, will they deadlock?\n\nMoreover, when the table becomes huge, with hundreds of terabytes, will a lambda and pyiceberg be able to vacuum and compact the table? If you compact the table every day, you now have a third writer you need to organize: The scheduled ingestion, the backfill and the compactor might all start committing at the same time.",

This was my first analyst gig too, so don’t expect anything too cool—it was 100% locally ran Python that generated an Excel file daily.\n\nIt was an Excel workbook with a summary sheet and another sheet for every country’s detail page. It used Excel formulas like HYPERLINK() to let users conveniently jump around the thing. Using Python allowed me to move a lot of the calculation backward into the Python step though, so I could basically bootstrap every cell with hardcoded values in its functions—no dynamic lookup stuff needed. It made the excel unmaintainable, sure, but it was quick as hell despite being big as hell. The python was maintainable, and I think that was the point. Excel was just the interface, getting generated every day from scratch.\n\nThe Python script would connect to like 8 different APIs (a corporate db, several Google APIs, Reddit, Meta, and two porn networks) and generate a fresh report every morning. It was actually easier to regenerate the whole thing every day, than to try updating any single copy. The sources maintained their own history, and I just pulled it in every single day. Worked like a charm. I don’t work there anymore, but I often think about how I hope they’ve upgraded that thing by now (assuming it’s still around).",

Both at home and on the job, I had a few different titles between then and now and Data Engineer seems to have all but replaced ETL Developer in the job market from what I have seen. I was a bit uncertain when I first started applying for DE roles and most of them were no joke, job requirements I couldn't have handled 6 or 7 years ago.

Then we even added methods that would make the object prune rows that were not present in some related tbl. such was business need. and the surface code was much less verbose than without the oop. easier to read.\n\nsimilar with FP: e.g. you need to applt some transfornation to all column names in a df, write a function that takes another funcion and applies it tobthe names. now you can focus on the transformation logic without worrying about mechanics. you can also unit test both without actually querying for the data frames (make substitute objects that present column names similarly ad df do).\n\nedit: sorry for typos. my phone kbd too small for my fat fingers",

And the project has been actively maintained since then with bi-weekly kubeflow calls and even a release 2 months ago. \n\n> In May 2025, the Apache Spark Kubernetes Operator launched as an official subproject \n\nKind of. The first formal release just happened, but it was launch as an official subproject in 2023 ([voting thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/wdy7jfhf7m8jy74p6s0npjfd15ym5rxz)) and the first commits happened [a few months later](https://github.com/apache/spark-kubernetes-operator/commit/eddc7e6bef0c270f5d3f3bbe0aef83e77cb2d5ba). \n\n> Core maintainers say they might converge APIs eventually\nThey do? \n\nOne other huge difference this article doesn’t mention is the kubeflow operator is Go (like most operators) and the Apache one is Java. This has the benefit making the Apache one more performant as it’s not shelling out to `spark-submit` and starting a new JVM for every job submission. But the Apache one is missing some good metrics, the Prometheus output doesn’t support tagging, and the SparkApplication resources have to be manually deleted (causing problems at scale if you don’t).",

        "body": "Wait, am I understanding correctly: did you set up Airflow such that it is pulling DAG code from multiple repos? That's what the \"git submodules\" thing makes me believe is going on.\n\nMy advice: do not do that. Unless you have literally thousands of engineers, **just do a monorepo for Airflow DAGs**. There are few reasons to make it more complicated than that and there are a lot of upsides to the monorepo in terms of how real world projects develop, in addition to just relieving yourself of the deployment headache (which is the #1 reason). Those other reasons are:\n\n- a single commit can touch multiple DAGs across multiple projects\n\n- projects can share Airflow-level utils\n\n- sync dependencies in Airflow runtime\n\n- external DAG dependencies\n\n- easier to run a local version of the whole instance if your Airflow isn't dependent on CI-specific things to glue things together\n\n- less magic\n\nSo save yourself the headache and just do the monorepo.\n\nFrom there, deployment is very simple. Every major Airflow deployment method, including the Helm Chart but also MWAA and Astronomer, just mounts the `dags/` folder as a volume, and so deployments that do not introduce new dependencies are as simple as updating the folder.\n\nExternal systems that get called by Airflow can be in their own separate repos, but know where the dividing line is between those systems and Airflow as an orcestrator: KubernetesOperator, CloudRunCreateJobOperator, EcsTaskRunOperator. Yes modifying the `argv` of a container's command requires two commits across two separate repos, but that's not a big deal (cross-DAG commits are way more annoying when they're cross-repo; within-DAG commits being cross-repo is really not that annoying. The monorepo really wants to optimize for that case to be easier).\n\nAlso, never ever use git submodules. You can either take my advice right here right now, or you can waste your time and learn the hard way.",

This is fairly common though, so the thought of cloning a prod table to dev environment  could get you in trouble. Generally speaking though, any transformative logic that needs to be worked out can be done via specially curated files containing essential data points and scenarios within the data. Or you can simply write up a script against prod data so you can ensure your features make sense and then plug that in. Though in my experience the latter is less common.\n\nAnd yes during deployment phase you would ensure that these parameters that point to specific environments would be replaced with the relevant environment that the code has been merged to. Dev -> Test, Test -> Stage, etc… keep in mind though that there are times where dev, test, stg, prod are not simply different schemas in a larger database but are entirely different databases/workspaces themselves and have maintained the same naming convention so sometimes nothing needs to change. An example of this would be databricks workspaces with exact same naming for database objects for each individual environment and when you deploy to other environments you just ensure the target workspace is where the code is being deployed. \n\nHope this helps!",

This ends up being a win-win because I don’t have to deal with “fuzzy matching” and potentially having false positive matches leading to an incorrect results.

Do these issues impact the wider business to warrant resolving this, or does the pain of a couple data engineers suffice (learn to pick and choose your battles).\n\nAssuming it's worth solving, you need to follow the chain of events that go from data entry, to ingestion, to landing in your database of interest. Then determine which parts of the chain you control and don't.\n\nThe areas you don't control are going to be where the real change needs to happen. You need to get out of the safety of code and databases and start talking to the teams to understand their processes and how to incentivize them to change. Not doing this means you will be constantly putting a technical bandaid over garbage data that changes constantly.\n\nHow have I done this before?\n\nIn a previous role I was combining sales, product, and customer success time tracking data. Being in B2B SaaS means expansions were a big deal and were managed by CS. I quickly found the time tracking data was awful, and looking at the time stamps of \"tracked time\" and \"time it was entered\" showed that everyone was dumping data at the end of the quarter.\n\nHow do I get them to improve time tracking (despite doing such is awful)?\n\nWell I analyzed the data and saw that some employees were overworked while others didn't have enough hours (imbalanced account assignments). In addition, some accounts were time intensive but low contract size (ie problematic customers). This got the attention of leadership, who gave me two CS staff to work on this project of improving time tracking data.\n\nI empowered those two CS staff with data and building a business case, and let them present to the CS org and take all the credit (I don't care that people know its me, I just want good data to make my life easier). Coming from their peers instead of me or leadership was way more powerful too!\n\nThe driver? If you consistently submit time tracking data, we will ensure you don't waste time on problematic accounts, you will be overworked less, and or have more opportunities for meaningful work as leadership will know how to allocate better.\n\nNot a single line of data quality code written... just getting in the weeds of the business and incentivizing people to change their behaviors that help them create better data.",

In addition to that fun, the rules that constituted a \"good\" address changed from country to country. The acid test for the US was the addresses in Atlanta, GA. There are dozens of valid variations of Peachtree. Some countries, such as Switzerland, had the individual/company as part of a valid address. This didn't even begin to address misspellings and incorrect abbreviations.\n\nIt is solvable and straightforward but not easy. You have to use different techniques for different problems in the data set. Sometimes a lookup against existing data is needed. Sometimes it is a correction table. \n\nIn this case, it required brut force data cleansing using SQL (so I could treat things as sets and get some performance). I was able to run through the entire set in about 25 minutes. Once the bulk of the data was cleansed, I started using the Google mapping API on the front end to validate addresses.

If they're large enough, you save them as s3 objects in their own right. If they're small, you send them to something like Kinesis Firehose, which will automatically buffer objects up to 15mins/300MB and then save them out to s3.\n\nIf you want to track where you are up to, and you are running all this in a single process, you can just have a json object in s3 that you overwrite with the currently active data, so that if something stops or crashes you can pick up from the last request. If you have multiple concurrent processes or it is updating very fast, you can store it all in a tiny DynamoDB against a particular key.\n\n---\n\nMicrobatching ingestion into a single duckdb database sounds off. You replace objects in s3, so every write will be a full rewrite of the file. If you wanted to make data like this available to duckdb for processing, you would be writing append-only to some other file format that duckdb could read.\n\nFor remote data instances with updates like this, you might use duckdb as the processing engine, but you would be using an open table format like deltalake or iceberg to allow you to do write transactions on the data in a way that is more amenable to the way object storage works.",

Learning from other people is a crutch and always will be.  I always thought in my previous career \"well, I'll just learn from this person until I can stand on my own two feet, and everything will be fine\".  It never happened.  I never improved and ended up hating my job because I became more experienced on paper, but in reality, my knowledge didn't correlate with my experience.  And it showed.\n\nWhen it came to DE, I taught myself and found it liberating not feeling like I was stuck, waiting for somebody else to hold my hand all the time.  I could just look at a piece of work, play around, get a feel for it and then continue from there.  Every time I learnt something new, it stuck much harder because I discovered it myself rather than somebody saying, \"Make sure you sort out XYZ\" before I had time to think about it.\n\nOn top of that, it's another incentive to go ahead and start building instead of another excuse to sit on social media all day, pushing you into the greatest trap - the illusion of learning.\n\nMy recommendation is to stop chasing the ideas of other people and develop your own.  Knowing what's good and what's bad comes with time. It's really common with beginners that they want to be perfect from the get go, so go out of their way to try and seek knowledge from people who claim to know more.  Making mistakes and being imperfect is part of learning.  I'm a firm believer you don't need a mentor and most people who say you need a mentor are, ironically, mentors.\n\n> Have any of you found value in attending data engineering or analytics conferences?\n\nMostly surface level.  I went to a large one in Europe and my manager joked at the time \"Remember: you are all happily employed\" because it was a running joke that the conferences are just for companies to poach from other companies.  I enjoyed the community aspect, learnt a few things.  Won some competitions.  Getting paid to have fun in a new city is fun.\n\n> Any learning paths or courses that helped you understand more than just what works but also why?\n\nHonestly? Teach yourself, be willing to learn (as in, be wrong and improve rather than be wrong and convinced you'll be right the next time with exactly the same approach).

Your proposed Title fact table contains fields which do not depend on time of observation (e.g. runtime - that should be a numeric attribute of the title dimension).\n\nStar should ideally model something different.

Its hard, when you are starting, to change the thinking of relational database modelling to dimensional, but -\n\nDo a simple report with sum of sales by some dimension - customer, product... with a filter on date and you will see the idea and build on that.

If your descriptive concept has a 1:many relationship to a fact table (meaning only one description is related to a single record) then you directly join that dimension to the fact.  Title would be an example of that as a movie only has one title.  A many to many relationship would use a bridge table, in this case people.  There are many actors in each movie.  Generally you want to avoid many to many, but it's useful  for some cases like that.  I usually put a fact, or column to aggregate, in my factless fact tables as it's often easier to deal with in BI tools, but it's optional.  Y\n\nou also want to consolidate your dimensions so that related information is not in a separate table.  Title, title type and title season are all related, or do not differ across the rows of the fact.  A movie will always have been produced in the same season, have the same category, director or whatever.  If you wanted to represent movie revenue in your fact by region, then you would have a separate dimension for region as the same title would have several records in the fact with different regions and different revenue amounts.  \n\nHigh level looking at this I think you have a fact table, date dimension, title dimension and actor dimension with a bridge.  Might be a bit more complex if I thought through it, but looks pretty simple.",

It depends, if you’re a legitimate DE then it would be more technical unless you’re a pipeline monkey. You typically have to have advanced knowledge of SQL and some programming language. Tableau would not be a very convincing Transform skill as a DE like it would be for a DA. You’d be better off learning dbt, Python, or Spark.\n\n4.

I suppose you could catch the data passed to the API, write it to a source table for the model, invoke the model with some flavor of \\`dbt run\\` and then gather the data from the output table and send it back. Even if you could inject the source data in a more clean way either via a seed or passing in data like a test would, the output is still going to go to a table which you'd have to retrieve.

First up you wouldn’t make this synchronous…so we will need a queue like SQS.\n1. Rest endpoint in whatever framework deployed with API gateway and lambda\n2. When the request comes in the lambda writes a request to our SQS queue\n3. Fargate listens to the SQS event and executes a dbt run where each variable specified gets passed as args into Jinja e.g \n```\ndbt run --vars '{\"key\": \"value\"}\n```\nWhere the vars here are those that were POSTed to your api endpoint. I wouldn’t use the cli runner but instead the newer added programmatic dbt runner (https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/programmatic-invocations)\n4. When the job is complete it sends some kinda signal of its completion back to SQS.\n\nVery alternatively… again terrible experience synchronously\n\n0. Same SQS and lambda\n1. instead make the api create a new Jinja file with all the variables dumped in statically \n2.  After writing the file it then commits to git.\n3. You have a GitHub action or whatever listening which deploys the model via CI.\n\nMaybe if you can explain more of the problem there might be a better solution…I’m guessing the view is less important and what your users actually care about  is the resulting data?\n\nTa",

You create a dag that compiles and run your model and exposes the orchestrator api.\n\nBut it might be to complex.\n\nI would probably create a fast api app and expose its api ( secure it and so on).\nCalling your api would create a background task that compiles the dbt project and run it. Not using the background task could make the request timeout coz it take some time.\n\nAnd this could be your biggest problem: this would take a lot of time.\nIs it possible to compile your model in different variations and then use correct version based on the columns in the request? \n\nIf not the case- try catching the queries so if an user calls with columns a and b. You compile the models and save the compiled model in a map. Colums as a key. When next time the same user calls the api with the same columns they do not go trough the pain of compiling it. \n\nAnd as one suggest previously wrap the dbt in a service with the queue. So it work on one request at a time.\n\nLots of additional questions could be asked but it seems like nice interesting task.",

They both allow you to create visualizations and provide some API functionality to execute SQL queries. For instance, Superset lets you connect directly to your database and has APIs you can tap into for querying data.\n\nAnother option would be to use DreamFactory to generate REST APIs from your dbt models with minimal hassle. It automates some of the heavy lifting and has great built-in features like security and database schema mapping. Plus, it works nicely with a range of databases if you ever need to switch things up. Between Superset, Metabase, and DreamFactory, you should find a fit that makes this process a breeze.",

One thing that really helped me was focusing on real-world problem-solving rather than just theoretical concepts. Try to frame your ML and GenAI projects around actual business challenges – it'll make your skills way more relevant in interviews.\n\nFor metrics, I'd suggest tracking your progress on coding challenges and your ability to explain complex ideas simply. That last bit is huge in interviews. \n\nBTW, I actually created a resource called Experimentation Career by Atticus that dives deep into prepping for data roles. It's helped a bunch of folks land jobs at top tech companies. Might be worth checking out if you want a structured approach. Good luck with your prep – you've got this!",

Keeping adapters pluggable while managing schema evolution can be tricky. I've seen Protobuf and Avro co-exist by employing a versioned API and maintaining translation layers for different formats. As the source schemas evolve, design your adapters to convert attributes by using version tags that can read old and new formats.   For handling backward compatibility, I’ve found success in employing a gradual deprecation strategy, where deprecated fields are flagged and eventually phased out after ensuring historical data doesn't rely on them. This requires robust logging and version tracking to maintain access to past sessions without breaking existing conversations. I've tried tools like HashiCorp's Consul for real-time schema sync, but DreamFactory is noteworthy for schema management when integrating multiple data sources into one cohesive setup. It's worth exploring how it can simplify your process for managing schema changes across SQL, NoSQL, and more.",

You do a lot of obligatory null checking or similar exception avoidance where you would need an if statement normally. And you need to do this a couple dozen times for different properties. Using a ternary lets you keep a block of all your property assignments that’s likely to fit on your screen and be easier to read and check off against a mapping spec. \n\nIn normal coding, I prefer if statements. The style should make the pattern obvious while skimming a thousand lines of unfamiliar code base. My eyes are going to naturally see the loop and conditional blocks first and I may not read every assignment until I find the section I’m looking for. If a critical condition is camouflaged to look like part of an assignment block, that’s annoying.",

It keeps the entire thing on one line just so that things don't look as messy and cluttered, and the presence of the operator itself tells you that we have a 1-liner going on here.\n\nIn other languages that don't have them, I still tend to prefer the 1-liner for the same reasons, but I also just feel weird about it because it's not as immediately apparently what's going on. I'll use some Free Pascal as an example, because that is unfortunately my favorite language to work with.\n\n  \nIn C/C++\n\n    // no ternary\n    if (X > Y) {\n      return X;\n    } else {\n      return Y;\n    }\n    \n    // ternary\n    return (X > Y) ?

In FPC and other language that don't have one, it's only very slightly more effort to figure out what's going on, but it still kinda rubs me the wrong way and I might want to just use the whole if..else block to make the intention more clear.\n\nAll that being said, it's basically all inconsequential and up to personal preference. I can't see getting upset over seeing multiple blocks of conditionals vs. multiple 1-liners.",

The only thing happening \"under the hood\" is a shift in who's responsible for certain aspects of your data systems' infrastructure. Think renting in multiple tiers, starting with a simple VM /VPN (Infrastructure as a Service) up until you being responsible only for remembering your password to your webspace account (Software as a Service). \n\nNow imagine a boardmember in big-corpo. One of their main tasks is  increasing **shareholder-value**. And IMHO the possibility to stretch such a huge costcenter over time by paying for usage was the main driver cloud became so popular. Big companies are suddenly much more flexible, scaling ressources as the user-load required.\n\nSo the main decision variable is expected server-load and variance thereof, as well as the geographic distribution of your audience. \n\nFor example I'm running my own server with Neo4j Spring Boot (Java) backend and Angular (Typescript) frontend. My 5 users are happy.\n\n\nCheers!",

Without four layers of over-complex libraries, multiple API calls during page load, etc.\n\nPHP is still there, classic ASP is not. PHP gets a lot of hate online nowadays, but mostly of people that have no idea - ignore them. In general there are much more options now, both on backend and frontend.

Clouds (Amazaon AWS, Google, Cloudflare, ...) are world-wide networks that offer various services that can (but don't have to) differ significantly. The upsides is that you can get some advanced features relatively easy and possibly cheaper than DIY, eg. redundancy and failover (if one server fails, no data loss and almost zero downtime, no human fixing needed), scaling (depending on how much your thing is used currently, it can use more or less servers automatically, and you only pay for what you use), ... Downsites include that sometimes the structure of the software needs to be adapted to the cloud environment, possibly security and data protection concerns, ...\n\nYes, JS can run on the server too.\n\nAside from programming languages, many web-related things were developed in your time frame. HTTP3, Wasm, Serviceworkers, ... (and many more things) ... and of course, lets not forget HTML 5 and CSS 3.\n\nAlso, some law topics - eg.

Then I did it again using only functional programming. Then I asked chatgpt to make the most efficient version that IT could and got a version using vectorization and running at least 100x faster than my implementation. \n\nThat led to reading about what vectorization is and how to utilize it effectively, it wasn't even a tool in my toolbox until then but now that will stick with me. Learned about SIMD (same instruction multiple data) and how python as an interpreted language works with compilation to byte-code and finally being ran by the cpython virtual machine, as well as how using numpy and vectorization drastically reduced the compilation step as numpy uses precompiled C/Fortran subroutines. All because I just heard something not useful, but interesting and wanted to give it a shot because why not.",

To completely hand over software development to AI means you are just automating automation, which gives you less control and specificity.\n\nThat said, for writing difficult algorithms or complex systems, AI may be used for most of that work in the future, the same way that chess engines can outplay humans.\n\nThe problem with AI coding right now is that it is simply based on large language models, not a formal system such as coding verification. for example, you can task large language models to play chess, but they constantly suggest illegal moves and while they can make some very clever moves, they also make incredibly stupid ones at times as well.\n\nAI coding will take off once the machine learning systems are based on rigorous formal descriptions of programming languages, not just general large language models.\n\nRight now I would argue the best uses of AI for coding is translating large code bases from one language to another, prototyping of very simple ideas, or embedding an AI system to allow users to prompt the text.\n\nThe problem is LLMs are very easy to apply to a wide variety of tasks, but LLMs aren't specifically tailored for programming, so just like LLMs are much worse than a chess engine, specifically designed for chess, there will likely be innovations for ai programming that aren't just \"feed this LLM a bunch of code and see what it can do.\"\n\nLLMs will continue to get better, but even before LLMs people created logical proof systems and formal verification tools that are much more specific to programming.\n\nI imagine a scenario where you just write the test cases and then the ai system generates the code and algorithms that can pass those test cases.",

This allows you to use an existing passion to help fuel a growing passion— or, more literally, you will be less bored and more curious and driven to experiment and learn, because you have the ability to apply your learnings to something you already enjoy.\n\nIn my case, I believe this to be true because I picked up JS to write some user scripts that helped me automate some tasks as a customer support worker. This experimentation of using programming to help me make my life easier lead to me learning other languages for other things, but in general having that user script to work on while I was doing customer support allowed me to actively identify and experiment with new features that could make the job easier for me. That experimentation is what made me keep going with coding, because of the instant gratification provided by my new feature making my job easier.\n\nUltimately, if you can think of an every day thing that you do that you deposit a significant amount of time into, if you can find a language that will allow you to effectively “hook into” and augment that interest of yours, you will find it a lot more rewarding and satisfying to write code.\n\nPractically speaking, with Java or Python as your two presumptive options, if you’re interested in AI you will have to use Python. On the other hand, I know so many people who have tried python and just given up on coding, while I know so many people who have gotten into Java development because they wanted to write mods for Minecraft— this Java development then blossomed into a career in software development.\n\nIf you play Minecraft, learn Java. You’ll be able to write mods for the game and play with them and this will help you keep your curiosity and enthusiasm.",

        "body": "Reading a book and writing a book require different neural pathways (in a sense). While not reading books makes it extra difficult to write books.\n\nThe same roughly goes for code. You have to get used to writing smallish projects (and mediumish projects and then eventually largish projects). The act of writing and debugging (thinking your way out of the maze you are in, tacking bits on an existing solution, rewriting / refactoring code) is how you learn to get better at writing code. \n\nStart with something basic. text based calculator for instance. The thing I like to work on with people is a dungeon crawler. a text based game where you walk through a dungeon. it teaches you all sorts of abstractions (whether you prefer OO or not) and it's a good way to write a solution first, then later on realise there is a better way and to have to rip the guts out of your code and write it again but better.\n\nlook up gameloop (it looks a little like:)\n\n    public void game() {\n        while (true) {\n            // for keyboard (and non-realtime):\n            Command c = getUserCommand();\n            c.perform(player, world); // do stuff like \"go north\" or \"pull lever\"\n            world.update(); // have other game objects do their thing.\n            String map = world.render(player); // draw an ascii image of the local map, player gives player position\n            // this isn't a very good game loop per se but it is a rough start.\n            System.out.print(map);\n        }\n    }\n\nwith something like the above you can practically do anything. for realtime rendering there are changes you need to make, but for a roguelike the above is sufficient. Build just a single room you can walk around in. (a room is for instance a 2d array with wall or non-wall . player position dictates where the player is. have the player move around. write that as code and you can then move on to player colliding with walls, items being located in places. write other mobs, have mobs move around. create doors, pitfalls, have mobs attack or have them calculate field of view (and if they see player they move toward them). all sorts of things.\n\nthen when you've build a number of these things you'll find it's inefficient. and then you start learning when you rewrite parts to be better/work better for what you want of them.\n\nI would stay away from leetcode problems and the like. try to work on something actual.\n\nif the above isn't it for you, try doing something that parses an excel sheet or does stuff with sound. or create a small paint program that lets you set pixels. just pick something you actually are interested in because that helps you with thinking of what next to add.",

It's common in programming because the field attracts a lot of egotistical know-it-alls, and YouTube videos amplify this because it gets clicked. To ensure I'm not being hypocritical, please also treat this comment with some skepticism.",

Different languages and tools are gonna be better suited for different ways of thinking.\n\nMy personal hypothesis is that many of those loud smart men are indeed very smart. A lot of their confidence comes from their own intelligence. They are in an industry that validates that intelligence, and celebrates sharing that intelligence. This can lead to many thinking that if they’re really smart, and their way of thinking is really efficient, and it works, and they can see how other people agree that it works, then therefore it must be the ONLY or at least the BEST way. \n\nAnd that’s where they lose me. It’s like an ER doctor and an anesthesiologist fighting over who performs the best intubations. They both have enough overlap so that they know what the other is talking about. And both will have merits on how one specific aspect might be better or worse. But reality is that they’re both similar enough but with specific tailoring adapted for different environments, needs, pressures, etc. ",

        "body": "Two points:\n\n1. Most of the top software engineers make a ton of money at work and then spend their free time with their families and friends—they don't hang around on Reddit all day typing comments about OOP. Typically it's the jobless, the students, or the juniors with low responsibility at work who have extra time and motivation to hang around on programming forums all day. Exceptions apply of course, but that's the general gist of it.\n2. Most of the best software out there is written with OOP, Java, C++... Basically with everything that you don't see as being fancy or recommended on Reddit.\n\nCan you find a connection between these two points?\n\nCould it be that the real seniors who are working on real projects and being paid top money are still using OOP, Java, C++, etc.? Or to be more accurate, they use whatever works the best for the task at hand, whether that's OOP or FP or something else entirely?\n\nMeanwhile the \"seniors\" who either 1. haven't quite grasped OOP *yet*, or 2. gave up after they failed once instead of thriving to improve —are the very people who are most active on these forums, trying to justify their opinions to others, religiously hating the most successful and widespread paradigm of all time instead of learning the ups and downs of each approach.\n\nSo why do these people hate OOP in the first place? Because it's easy to get wrong. It's an insanely potent tool when used right, but it takes years of experience, active studying, experimenting, and trial and error to get right. They've seen horrible inheritance trees based on the \"is-a\" vs \"has-a\" rule, which completely fails if you use it with the English language rather than the physical constructs. Some examples of this going with English are:\n\n- Wrong: A football player *is-a* human -> `FootballPlayer extends Human`\n  - Correct: A human *has-a* job or a hobby -> `player.hobby = football`\n- Wrong: An invisible video-game enemy *is-a* video-game enemy -> `InvisEnemy extends Enemy`\n  - Correct: An enemy character *has-a* opacity -> `enemy.opacity = 0.0`\n- Wrong: An android phone *is-a* phone -> `Android extends Phone`\n  - Correct: A phone *has-a* operating system -> `phone.os = android`\n\nThese are just some of the examples where following the English language fails you, and where you should rely on the [Composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) principle instead. Of course people have taken this too far to the other extereme as well, going as far as erasing all of language support for inheritance and forcing inheritance through composition... which sucks as well. Android very much *is-a* operating system, and Firefox very much *is-a* browser.",

Programming isn't all that much math unless you go into game dev, finance, and a couple other domains.\n\nYou'll most likely need longer, need more practice, but that's about it.\n\nDon't know for how long you've been programming, but if you made that assessment when you do it for less than 6 months, it is meaningless because it is premature. Learning anything takes time, effort, persistence, discipline, and hard work along with ample practice.",

The sheer amount of people who just give up is astonishing.  And they're not giving up because they're having a problem with objects and classes.  Most give up and say things like \"I didn't remember which order to put the words 'world' and 'hello' in and I had already spent a few days watching videos without typing anything.\"  \n\nAnd so now I've amended it to: \"Anyone can learn programming if they are willing to put the time and effort in.  You have to be willing to accept that you may not see any results at first and feel frustrated, and that it might take 2 to 4 years to really feel comfortable, especially if you're brand new and have never done this before.\"",

Also LeetCode and that type of programming doesn't really translate to real world projects. The best way to get better is by doing simple projects at first, and add complexity over time. For instance, I used to be a trainer for cyber developers in the C programming language. We used to start them off by having them build a simple calculator. What they didn't know is that we weren't really grading how well they could add and subtract numbers, but rather how secure their code was. Can I break it, or exploit it in some way? Are they checking for underflow and overflow? After a couple failed submissions they would finally catch on and understand what they needed to do to pass the tests. Next would be FileCalc, which is okay do the same thing, but all the equations are stored in files, and I want you to give me a file of all the solutions. Again we'd test them by giving them bad files to see if they were doing proper error handling and such. Then there was ThreadCalc, which was okay now do everything using a thread pool. And NetCalc, okay now do ThreadCalc but over a network.\n\nIf they could do all of that we figured they had learned enough to be on the team and contribute. But it takes time. You do most of your learning through failing, not succeeding. So take everything you're doing right now and understand that it's hard and that's okay. Nobody should expect you to be able to contribute immediately unless you're experienced.\n\nAlso, we have quite a few west point grads, and they struggle as much as anyone would. So don't feel like you're going through it alone. It takes time to get good. A lot of it is about pattern recognition. Over time you'll start to see what are called \"code smells\" and you'll immediately see things that look weird and out of place, which means you're improving. If you can look at code you did 6 months ago and your immediate reaction is: \"this is garbage\", then that's a tell-tale sign you're improving. Good luck and don't sweat the small stuff.",

The number of projects I or friends of mine have started and never finished massively outweighs the ones completed, that's the nature of things. Even the ones that got done were a struggle, you have to decide when something is truly worth pushing through for and make yourself do it (sometimes because you really believe in it, sometimes just because you're being paid). Otherwise chalk it up to learning and move on.  \n\nI think the main thing is for you to release some of the pressure you're putting on yourself. Your family wants you to do well, and you want to do well for their sake, but pushing yourself into a corner won't help with that. Focus on what you're doing, not anyone else. Finish your masters. Put effort into looking for a job, but understand there's no guarantee so don't punish yourself if you're having trouble. If getting a job was easy, or guaranteed, everyone would be following the same path. That path doesn't exist. Just do your best, play your cards as well as you can, and hope like the rest of us.  \n\nYou are not special, or in other words, you're as special as any of us. Everyone fails sometimes, even the best in the world, everyone can compare to another and think \"damn I wish I had that\". As long as you keep going, maybe some day you can make something amazing and be someone special for that moment - but that moment always fades, glory never lasts forever. Nobel prize winners will wake up one morning and dread plugging away at the next thing, wondering if they've lost their touch... point I'm making is you carry on going regardless, sprinting or crawling, that's the only way it all happens. No-one stops \"feeling like a failure\", not permanently. Don't stress the low points, and try to keep your mind clear so you can recognise when you've got the chance for brilliance and take it when it happens.  \n\nPersonally, and this is where the sub might disagree, my excitement and curiosity is all around the crazy progress being made in AI tech. Big changes are on the horizon, if you ask me, so try to stay flexible and see if you can take advantage of that in some way. The job market is bad for non-seniors right now, but we have no idea how it's going to shake out over the coming year or so. Stay alert, learn whatever you can, and hold on for the ride. Anyone telling you they *know* what's about to happen is lying, or foolish.  \n  \n\nTL;DR  \n - Finish your masters.  \n - If you can get a job, any job, great. Working for money is an experience just like learning a new tech.  \n - If you can't, try to survive. Everything is about to be turned upside down anyway (IMO).  \n - Nothing is forever. Falling behind and pulling back ahead again are natural in the rat race of life.  \n - Relax. As much as is possible. You're 22, you have many, many high points and low points ahead of you.  \n - Do your best and hope. This is also advice to literally every other person who reads this, and myself.",

The engineering world is in a bit of a strange place right now. With the rise of AI and a shaky global economy, tech jobs have become harder to find. But I do believe this will shift in time.\n\nOne big challenge is that many people involved in hiring aren’t developers themselves. They're often finance-driven decision-makers who don’t fully understand the nuances of engineering work. That can make things frustrating — especially when the hiring process includes unrealistic coding challenges that don't reflect real-world development.\n\nThese days, there’s a dangerous expectation that every dev needs to be \"elite.\" The truth is, tech moves fast, and everyone has different strengths. Some are more technical, others better at architecture or communication. The role of a developer is evolving — communication, collaboration, and adaptability are becoming just as important as coding skills. The era of working in isolation, coding for hours without interruption, is mostly gone.\n\nStill, there *will* be jobs. The industry is in transition, and once it stabilizes, opportunities will open up again. Try not to stress about being “mediocre” — imposter syndrome is incredibly common, even among experienced developers. I’ve been doing this for years and still feel it at times, but I’ve learned that most people do.\n\nAt the end of the day, software development is about solving problems and moving data — it doesn’t have to be overcomplicated. Many tools and frameworks have added unnecessary layers, but the core principles remain the same.\n\nSo hang in there. Keep learning, stay curious, and don’t compare yourself to others. Just focus on getting a little better each day — that’s how long, fulfilling careers are built.    \n\n  \nYes i chucked this into chat gpt to fix my terrible grammar.

As a beginner programmer, you probably don't care about any of that unless your explicit goal is to use the language as a means to learn about what's going on at the hardware level. It sounds like you just want to build something cool. Languages like C# or python or javascript are much better suited to that purpose. Moreover, there is really no rule that you need to \"stick to a language\". Sure, if you're a professional with 10 YoE it makes sense to stick to your area of expertise, but besides that, you should feel free to oscillate between lots of languages whenever you want. Even single projects can combine multiple languages. You should think first about what you want to learn or build, and then work from there to what's a good language for that.

Build an app that tracks stats for your favorite sport, or a color palette manager for your digital art hobby, or turn your resume into an interactive website. Most importantly though, don’t wait until you’ve learned everything to try one of these projects. Try to push your skills as far as you can after every lesson.

Before we evaluate, we must be able to analyze.\n3. Before we analyze, we must be able to apply knowledge/skills.\n4. Before we apply, we must understand what we do and why we do it.\n5. Before understanding, we must be able to recall accurately.\n\nThings slipping through your mind is a signal that the foundations aren’t strong enough, and frankly this is an iterating process of discovery whenever you try new things.\n\nBe patient and start slow.\n\nStart by mirroring the stupid simple stuff until you are able to recall facts and the basics.\n\nThen practice explaining the ideas or concepts behind what you are doing. Also, predict and test experiments to facilitate assimilation; e.g. what would happen if I DO or DONT DO something? What if it’s slightly different?\n\nProgress into applying your knowledge into solving simple and complex problems. A simple problem is one where you directly apply some knowledge. A complex one is where you first need to decompose into smaller problems, then build up to the bigger more general solution.\n\nWhen you are comfortable with those, the next cognitive level is analysis. Draw connections among ideas, compare them against others.\n\nAfter that you’ll be able to confidently evaluate options and alternatives and justify your decisions (and if proven wrong, then you’re still learning more).\n\nFinally, after all that, you’ll become able to synthesize all that knowledge and skills with fluency so that most of your efforts are focused on designing and creating solutions.\n\nPracticing the basics, over and over, will naturally put you in a position to apply what you learned and eventually reach mastery.\n\nThis framework can help you charter your learning journey—yet the key remains being patient and consistent.",

You can't whittle it down yet; it will whittle itself down as you get more experienced. Start anyway. Be prepared to forget a lot the first few times you do it: memory builds up gradually and incrementally, not all at once.\n\nSooner or later, you'll have used for loops (or whatever) so much that you can throw away your old notes on them entirely, or refine those notes into just the tricky little corners you keep getting stuck on or some cool new feature you heard about recently. That's okay. Your notes can evolve with you.\n\nTry working through a tutorial on whatever language you're learning, and every week or three, pause to design yourself a \"cheat sheet\" of what you've learnt so far. (Look up other cheat sheets on Google Images for inspiration of how to lay them out. Try to make it maximally useful for **you**, not just to cram it full of as much information as you can get on the page. Don't be afraid to go through lots of rough drafts and lots of scrap paper.

I had issues with fine motor control, basically it hurts to write.  The biggest issues with this is that my penmanship sucks, and I trained myself to get to the point quickly.  I would write just enough to get the point across.  This didn't help my English grade when I need to write a three page paper.  So I had to constantly go back and be more descriptive.  My family got a home PC and this helped, but I still needed to write out all my answers for tests.\n\n2. My short term memory was found to be lacking.  This frustrated my parents because if I wasn't actively listening to them when they told me to do something I would literally not remember what they said, or often not even remember we had a conversation.  Of course the way around this was they had to make sure they had my full attention before telling me to do something.\n\n3. There might have been other stuff, but I don't remember. \n\nLooking back on school, I did well in Math and Science where I would understand the concepts and apply them.  I did poorly in History and English where there is a lot of memorization.\n\nI am now the lead programming architect at my company.  If people have bugs they can't solve, they come to me.  If people don't know how to write something, they come to me.  If there is a bug anywhere in our code base, I can fix it, not because I remember exactly what that code does, but I understand how that code should work.\n\nWhen programming people start off learning the language, which is needed.  The only way you are going to remember the language is by using it, by writing programs. I \"know\" many many languages, I will learn a new one for fun to see if I like it better than whatever is currently my favorite, but if I don't program in a language for a month, I have to use google to refresh my memory.\n\nTruthfully, anyone can learn a programming language, but to really program you need to be able to think logically, you need to be able to break big problems down into smaller tasks, then break those smaller tasks into even smaller tasks.  You keep doing that until those tasks are small enough that you can logically perform them in a programming language....any programming language.  The language is just a way to tell the computer what it needs to do and there are many ways to do that.  Again the only way to get good at that, is to program.",

Programming is the one discipline where it’s actually encouraged to rely on the internet as much as you want since it would be impractical for us to remember every little detail about every language and library we use, and most programming languages and libraries have extensive documentation online.\n\nOnce you are past learning the fundamental structures of code (data types, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.) everything you want to do with code is just a few well-constructed google searches away. Learning to code is as much about learning how to do efficient research as it is about learning actual coding.\n\nI will say, having short term memory just emphasizes the need for good coding practices even more, which many beginners tend to neglect. Good coding is all about foresight, and sacrificing time in the present to save you work in the future. Make sure you take the time to write yourself clear and helpful comments at every step of the way while coding and whenever you see multiple ways of writing some code, choose the way that is easiest to read; this will save you so much mental strain down the road. You should be able to tell generally what a piece of code does just by looking at it for a few seconds, even if it’s like you’ve never seen it before.\n\nYou’ll also learn there are ways of structuring your code such that you don’t have to remember how the whole system works all at once in order to understand one piece of it.

The better you learn to follow these design principles the easier of a time you will have coding bigger and bigger projects.",

You need all that as a basis for advanced learning.\n\nHowever, where it differs is in how programming is used. I come from the angle of a computer engineering and robotics/mechatronics dropout.\n\nIn CS you have a lot of focus on how to think about computation and the nature of the algorithm. Stuff like Big O / algorithmic efficiency, memory efficiency, information theory, a lot of Claude Shannon's foundational works, also cryptography. And of course, in the 4th year, operating systems, compilers, databases, consensus algorithms, network programming (which is a totally different kind of beast).\n\nIn contrast, in Engineering, you will not need any of those things I mentioned in the CS paragraph.\n\nComputation in engineering, from a mechanical engineering perspective, is more about modeling, simulating physical properties/materials, extremely large scale numerical simulations (I think only the theoretical and experimental physicists deal with larger numbers) (aside: IEEE floating point is a mind bender!). Almost all of mechanical engineering programming challenges are safety related, as in if the program crashes or miscalculates, people die and processes explode or buildings come down or bridges collapse. So there is a lot of focus on \"tried-and-true\" methods of programming - no \"seat of the pants\" stuff there.\n\nThe best C programming teacher I ever had was a mechanical engineer, and almost all of his programming experience comes from programming the feedback loop that controls a large scale blast furnace at smelters - the program uses measurements from various sensors, and then controls the smelting process. He drilled safety issues (error check, bounds check, input sanitisation, improper casting, huge possibility of improper pointer usage, saturation vs wraparound on overflow, pair programming, code review, using static analysis tools, etc) into every single lecture, because if the program crashes or miscalculates, thousands of litres of molten metal would spill and destroy the plant.\n\nSome of our homework assignments in C contain a magnitude more error checking and recovery code than actual executable code - of course this is not realistic for programming in the workforce, but his point of view is that no one else will teach defensive programming after we get out of his class, so might as well make us do it over and over again as homework until it's drilled into our brains. The evaluation criteria for this kind of assignment is him and the TA trying to hack/crash/exploit the program (for example, one easy trick is for them to give some unexpected inputs and seeing how your program deals with that, which is a basic form of fuzzing). They write up their report for you, and if you fix the issues they give the mark back.\n\n\nMechatronics folks usually deal with real-time circuitry and need to complete evaluation loops within a pre-determined amount of time. Think bipedal robots that need to respond when it is about to fall - how does a robot recover from that situation? Things like aerospace engineering also fall into this category: how does a programmer create a \"fly-by-wire\" airplane program so it can correct and adjust pitch/yaw/roll, etc. within time and physical limits.\n\n\nIn these use cases, recursion and dynamic memory allocation, both mainstays of CS oriented programming, is forbidden.\n\nSome Electrical Engineers programming to do DSP (digital signal processing) - where you take in a massive amount of data and you filter stuff out - DSP programming is kind of like creating filters and sieves out of computer programs - it sounds glamorous but it's actually quite a bit of grunt work. I think one of the exercises is like - take this huge sample of RF random noise and filter it until you can hear the satellite transmission downlink. It's like using programming to find needle in a haystack.\n\nI don't know what the chemical engineers need from their programmers, but I'd assume it's also about simulation, chaotic/stochastic processes.\n\nAs you can tell, Computer science is primarily concerned with the nature of computing, and engineers use programming to work with the real world.\n\nThe real world is incredibly messy and our math doesn't always work. That, added to the incredibly strict safety tolerances makes engineering programming a really niche job - I personally don't think you can be a great aeronautics real-time programmer and a good database programmer at the same time.\n\nAs for your last question: are you into physical processes (blowing things up, making lights turn on and off, melting aluminum and using a mold to cast wheels, etc) or are you into computing, calculating, storing and searching information?\n\nIt's perfectly ok to be into both - just keep in mind that there are these 2 \"ways of thinking\" when it comes to programming.\n\nThe last bit of info is that in the real workforce, we work in teams: everyone brings a bit of their own \"special sauce\" to the team and that's how everything in the world is built/done.\n\nEven though the \"lone programmer\" is a trope in TV/media, that almost never happens in real life.\n\nIf you become a programmer, you *will be working within a team* - so one of the most vital skills over everything else, is learning how to work with people who are different from you: they have different skillsets, different communication methods, may speak different languages, etc. That's probably the most critical skill out of everything: learning to work with other people.\n\nHope this little overview helps and good luck!",

These don't have to be really impressive, but some story about how you figured out a multi-threaded program for a senior design project or optimized report queries at an internship show that you can. Same if you can speak to topics like memory management, compilation, good code structure, data structures and efficient iteration, etc. Shows you know what's going on under the hood and will make good decisions without undue handholding. If you can talk to working as a team through a SDLC with source control, testing, and promotion, it further goes to showing ordinary competence.",

You are usually expected to work in your preferred programming language. You should ask questions to clarify the problem scope and any other unclear details. It is essential that you talk through your problem-solving steps, be very verbal, and don't stop talking while you are working. It is OK to start with a simple brute-force or partial solution, and then iterate to improve it. \n* Expect a mix of technical and behavioral questions. For example, 'talk about a time when you found yourself running out of time to complete a project'. Each behavior question should be treated as an opportunity to send a signal about yourself - You are smart, work well with others, take ownership, think deeply when solving problems, etc. Review the Amazon Leadership principles (there are 14 of them), and try to include at least one in every single behavior answer. \n* Technical interviews are a learned skill. You only get better by doing more interviews. The skills you need to pass the interview are completely different from what you will do on the job or what you learned in school.",

Vim is an imperative editor: you have to tell the computer how to manipulate text by gluing together small commands. Vim modes in other editors usually contain about 10% of Vim’s functionality. So if you like them, you don’t know enough Vim, and you should go learn the other 90%.

You could probably run it smoothly on a laptop from 2010.\n\n2) It's 100% in terminal. You don't even technically need a DE or WM to run it (lightweight)\n\n3) EVERYTHING works with keyboard only. (Yes, that's technically possible with the other IDEs, but they are not built for that and you can tell. Even if you have hotkeys for everything, switching focus to another panel can be a pain in the ass alone, when compared to neovim) Not just the code editing, but the file searching, project managing, git controls, probably even database access. I am pretty good with my IDE, but I must admit, switching to a different part of the project is more clunky than it would be in neovim with a correct setup)\n\n4) It's just fun to configure.

I am unfamiliar with the word \"placement\", but it would probably help others if you mentioned you're from India so you get replies from those in India, otherwise, you tend to get an American or European perspective.\n\nI think it all depends on how well you know a programming language and DSA. There are two kinds of people (more than that, of course). There are those who want to learn a few key skills and be done with it, with a guarantee they won't have to learn anything more. I call this the \"barista\" type. You can't learn to make lattes and cappuccinos right away, but once you do, you're set. There's not a whole lot more to learn.\n\nThen, there are those that like to learn new things. It's this type that tends to do better as a programmer. \n\nI'm sure there are some jobs that don't require you to get past a certain point, e.g., there are still Cobol jobs and Cobol programmers, and that isn't changing so rapidly.  But for the most part, you'll likely have to learn something new. For example, I was programming in Java a lot, but if I were to do AI programming, I'd likely have to switch to Python.\n\nSorry there aren't any clear cut answers. If you ask \"If I do X, will Y happen\", the answer is, it depends on how you do X. That is, it depends on how much you master a programming language.\n\nTo delve into this just a bit deeper, there are two aspects to mastering a programming language.\n\nThe first has to do with learning the language, which means syntax/semantics of stuff like assignment statements, arrays, functions, classes, etc. It also means getting familiar with popular libraries. You may also have to learn a build tool. More recent languages tend to assume you're building a bigger program with multiple files.\n\nThe other part--and some would argue the more important part is to learn to think algorithmically. That is, how do you solve a problem. That part can depend on skills outside of programming. For example, if you are trying to trying to simulate gravity for a physics engine to be used in a video game, then you need to know some physics. You have to express the physics as code.\n\nJust because you program, you may lack the expertise in what the program is about. \n\nThen, there is a kind of vague goal of trying to organize your code well. I've been using Claude to help organize some of my personal projects and it does a pretty good job.",

To be comfortable in that language, start using it to solve DSA questions.\n\nAlso, be comfortable in one OOP language and another multi-paradigm language. So for your case, C++ and Python will do.\n\nFor DSAs, my advice is to pick Python because it's the easiest way to learn DSAs without worrying about the complexity of the language. When it comes to interviews, they will allow you to pick the language you are comfortable with. And Python will always be there as an option.\n\nIt's possible you just didn't like the web dev course by Harry. So try out another learning material. Or if nothing works, then it just means you don't like web dev.\n\nIn regards to the question in the post, if you can solve DSA questions, then you are halfway there. So many ask DSA questions in the interviews. So def get good at that. You should also get comfortable with OOP/OOD/design principles/SOLID patterns and other basic patterns. And work on some project that you are interested in. Use Git/GitHub to manage your project. Also, work on your behavioural interviews, use the STAR method: [https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR\\_Method\\_Interviews.pdf](https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf)",

Yes, they can't handle load, but you'll only have one client.) You'd use the localhost loopback to put the client and server on the same device. If it's OK to do everything in-browser, you could write everything in Brython and use standard HTML forms and JavaScript APIs. Making the client and server communicate is not that much harder. You'd do custom handlers. GUIs usually have at least two threads anyway, so you'll have to do something like this regardless. It might be slightly easier to install Bottle at that point, but the standard library can do it.\n\nThere's Gooey which automatically converts command-line applications into GUIs. It's pretty easy to use. That still has to be the workflow you want though.\n\nSince you're doing you a budget tracker, you could customize [PySpread](https://pyspread.gitlab.io/).

        "body": "I was in 9th grade in 1988 and loved programming, I wanted to be a programmer, but everyone talked about that in a few years, programmers wouldn't be necessary due to something called CASE-tools, where business-types could simply draw networks of rules in some fancy program, and that would then create the code needed. Programming jobs would only be for the handful of people making these CASE-tools.\n\nSo I went into hardware instead. And then the web happened, and all the CASE-tools for making mainframe business-programs were shoved to one side, because now everyone had to build something new. \n\nIn the late 90s everyone talked about programming being replaced by drawing UML-diagrams and then emailing them to India or other countries with cheaper labour, and they would then do the actual programming.\n\nThen languages like Python began to become popular, and everyone talked about programming not being just for programmers anymore, because now everyone could learn to program, and there would be no more need for dedicated programmers.\n\nThen a lot of low-code and no-code tools became popular, and everyone talked about that soon there wouldn't be more need for programmers.\n\nIn the late 2010s everyone began talking about how everything was already built, and in the future there wouldn't be more need for programmers, since most of the jobs would be simple adjustments to existing frameworks.\n\nAnd now, in the mid 2020s, everyone is talking about how in the future there won't be need for programmers, because some tool will handle everything for us.\n\n  \nThe problem with those tools, as amazing as they all are, is that they can only solve \"yesterdays problems\". As soon as some new technology, or a new business-problem, or a new oppertunity comes along, they aren't up to the job, and programmers have to step in.\n\nSo go ahead and focus on your interests - if you enjoy learning, programming, robotics, AI or whatever, you'll become good at it, and it will help you learn more stuff! Programming is always a good thing to learn - most of us won't work with the technologies we began learning on, but getting into the mindset of solving problems and building software, will always be a good thing! Even when the tech changes - only specific tech-knowledge becomes obsolete, but usually you use it to make learning the next thing easier!",

Practice coding problems regularly to improve your problem-solving skills.\n4. Take notes on what you learn and update your resume to include new skills and projects.\n5. Connect with peers or mentors who can guide you or share their internship experiences.\n\nConsistency is key—putting in steady effort every day will pay off.

It also opened up embedded systems more which goes along with the robotics, which now in my final year of college ive been making an autonomous drone for detecting and spraying pesticides on different types of plants.\n\nOf course you can do this in python as well, but C and C++ add some layers of challenge and fun because you can actually do everything by register level programming which gets fun and writing drivers.\n\nAnyways, not to say my path is the one you should follow but I think really sinking your teeth into one or two fields will give you a different perspective and don’t hold back, go full throttle into it.

Change things in the code, make it fail on purpose, trying to predict how it will fail, make it work again, create more files, move the files, delete the files, create them somewhere that's not the cwd, create them both in absolute path and relative...\n\nAnd after that, make three mini-projects about the new things you learned. It's not important to make too much sense with the mini projects, as loNg as they are relatively quick and make iou exercise that new knowledge.\n\nI've been doing it this way and... well, while I'm not 'there' yet, I am improving.",

If you keep programming, this will be a very useful skill, for all kinds of things that you will do.\n\nNowadays, you don't write CSS the way you did a few years ago. Nowadays, you have tools like TailwindCSS or frameworks like Bulma CSS. Also, JavaScript frameworks change the way you use CSS. E.g. Angular encapsulates CSS into components. That said, it is still perfectly fine to use \"vanilla CSS\".\n\nThere were opinions on how to structure CSS, but none has been really pervasive. There were also build steps like SASS or SCSS.\n\nI think your approach is perfectly fine. The only disadvantage I see is that your browser has to fetch each of those files individually, which is not the most efficient way.

        "body": "Hey, just wanted to say your approach to splitting CSS files is totally valid and actually mirrors how many developers manage their stylesheets. Organizing your CSS into separate files like header.css, utilities.css, and modals.css can make your codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate, especially as your project grows. This modular approach is a common practice in web development.\nWhile it's true that having multiple CSS files can lead to additional HTTP requests, which might slightly affect load times, the trade-off is often worth it for the improved organization and maintainability. Many developers use build tools to combine and minify CSS files for production, mitigating performance concerns.\nYour project, “Obscuria Terminal,” sounds intriguing, and it's commendable that you're learning from your dad's notes. Keep experimenting and refining your workflow; you're on a solid path.",

I made a deck shuffler and a character creator for a generic text based RPG, and then dropped it. I never programmed again until 2017 when I actually saw programming potential in an artistic/design context I was studying at that time. And then it clicked. I devoured every online lesson or book I could find. And went deep.\n\nIt is so important to frame a goal or problem you wanna solve. Makes the journey more motivating.\n\nWanna get into AI, Cybersecurity or Automating stuff: Python\nWanna get into Web: JavaScript\nWanna get into Games: C# or C++\n\nIt really doesn't matter.

Any files modified at one end was replicated at the other, maintaining dates and group ownership. As each file was moved, its CRC was noted, the files was tar compressed, uncompressed at the other end and CRC verified and result logged. This went on for years and there was never a file integrity error. A side benefit is that the Unigraphics modeling team lead had a privileged process to retrieve a file from the other end of someone messed up a model. That eliminated nuisance backup/restore requests.",

        "body": "Some people have suggested a compressed file system. That’s an option, but I think your approach is still better due to portability and forwards compatibility given your use case and the business intent I’m assuming from your post. \n\nA compressed file system is typically linked to its OS family and soft linked to its specific filesystem version. Every OS maintainer starts out with the intent to honor the contract of every feature of every filesystem they ever made, but they typically get sketchier and sketchier as the specific filesystem gets older and older. \n\nMeanwhile, zip and a few of its brethren have been portable across all operating systems for years and you can simply move a file from one machine on one os to another generally without any functionality issue. Zip also contains built in CRC protection in the file which although not the most modern has been sufficient since its creation. \n\nThe standard open source ‘zip/unzip’ available on Linux and macOS have long contained the same ‘test’ command that pkzip first introduced. Ie - unzip -t file.zip verifies all the CRCs of the files and the redundant copies of the metadata. \n\nIn actuality it’s probably just checking the metadata, decompressing all the files in memory and comparing them with the CRCs. That verifies the files without taking any additional file storage. \n\nSee if you can figure out how to directly trigger the ‘-t’ functionality via your library. Or alternatively just decompress them into the null device which accomplishes about the same. \n\nThere are still some theoretical gaps in the integrity of this system though. If the original zip run received bad data or the data was corrupted while in memory than the files in the zip will be corrupt even though they verify. You should definitely be doing this if you care enough on a machine with ECC ram. Disk errors at just the wrong time could also cause problems in the chain that go unnoticed. \n\nIn the ideal case you would have your own verifiable CRC produced at the very start of the chain where the source files were. Then you have something to check against anywhere in the chain without needing to go back and compare against the original files. \n\nFor example if you produced a sha256 hash of each file at the source machine you could then check against that hash anywhere in the chain.",

        "body": "For your first question, just create a checksum before compressing the folder. Then decompress it and check the decompressed file against the checksum. If it's good, you can be sure the file compressed correctly.\n\n\nYou should also create a checksum for the compressed file as well. That way you can verify the integrity of the compressed file whenever it's transferred somewhere.\n\n\nIdeally your system works like this.\n\n\n1. System identifies project file to be archived on the working server\n2. System generates checksum for project file/folder\n4. System verifies the checksum against the project file (redundant check, just to be sure)\n5. System compresses project file into archive file\n6. System decompresses archive file into decompressed file\n7. System checks the decompressed file against the checksum to verify compression worked properly. (This checksum can be discarded now, since most compression algorithms have internal checksums. You could keep it if you want, just don't confuse it with the checksum for the archive file.)\n8. System generates checksum for the archive file\n9. System verifies the checksum against the archive file (again, redundant check)\n10. System transfers the archive file to the archive server along with the checksum\n11. System verifies the transferred archive file against the checksum\n12. System deletes project file and archive file on the working server\n\n\nIf a verification check fails at any point, you just repeat the steps after the previous successful verification.\n\n\nAs for other compression tools, gzip and bzip have better compression ratios that zip. They're standard tools that are widely supported, so you shouldn't have any issues working with them.\n\n\nThere are other compression tools that offer minor improvements to compression ratio or speed, but are less popular, so unless you really *need* that extra file space they're probably not worth using.\n\n\nFinally, I see that you mention the archive is on a raid disk which is good, but I just want to encourage following the 3-2-1 rule for backups if you aren't already. If these files are critical enough to warrant all this work, the least you can do is pay a bit extra for offsite storage to ensure you can recover if the archive server blows up. Cold storage on AWS is extremely affordable.",

Classes, modules, folders, packages, microservices, clusters are just different ways of organizing functions. The bad architect (let's call them John) looks towards options higher up in that list, when putting a bunch of files into a well-named folder would be just as clean.\n2. Functions with side-effects need special attention: A pure function will rarely cause scalability issues, a function that upserts into a database will. Learning to segregate side effects is a skill that takes a lifetime to learn, but it really helps if you don't have to use @Transcational 8 times during a HTTP request's execution. The other day I sped up a messy procedure by 500% just by moving all db lookups to one place and parallelizing them, John would have held architecture meetings for the next half year to make the service with 20 monthly users \"multi-instance ready\" instead of identifying the bottleneck.\n3. Bounded-everything. To know how much scale you need, know how many resources you need. That's easy when you write code that needs a fixed amount of RAM, or that runs in a fixed amount of time. John does `database.readAll()` until one day the server crashes, and he gets pat on the back when he fixes the issue after a two-day outage. (Turns out the service was not multi-instance ready and they all crashed)\n4. Distributed systems are HARD. People love to add microservices willy nilly because it looks cool in the diagrams, but just really try to avoid it. I usually play devils advocate for just making a big monolith. Stick to conway's law, that's fine, but NO JOHN WE DO NOT NEED 11 FUNCTION APPS WITH 300LOC EACH JUST BECAUSE YOU READ ABOUT THE ADAPTER PATTERN AND KAFKA IN SOME BOOK.

You will get stuck and need help. If you don't have access to anyone who can help you in person, please plan on posting here on r/learnprogramming or other forums.\n\nIt's not that this will never happen with other languages, but in comparison if you wanted to try learning Python or web dev first, you could probably get a lot further without getting stuck.",

Are they primarily interested in learning concepts?\n* Inform them what you're willing to do for them\n* Inform them what you're not willing to do for them\n\nI can imagine two kinds of students that would want tutoring. First, there's those that are being forced to get a tutor because they are struggling. Maybe parents are pushing them. This can also work the other way where parents are trying to get their kids ahead. Second would be an older learner who just wants to get started. They are likely more motivated.\n\nThe difficulty in tutoring is whether students want you to do their homework for them, or do their projects for them. This is cheating. If you don't want to facilitate that, you should indicate that ahead of time.\n\nFor example, you can explain a scenario to the student where you say \"If you say to me 'I have to turn in this programming assignment by tomorrow, or I'll get a zero, and I've barely started!', I'm going to tell you, no, I don't do that. You should plan ahead on your assignments and not rely on me to do them for you.\"\n\nSetting expectations is something you should do.\n\nYou learn to teach as you go along, so what works for one student might not work for another.",

When should you save Classes to separate files, and why?

The first thing I'd suggest is zooming in with Ctrl+Plus - get it large enough that you don't have to sit as close to your computer screen.\n\nActually maybe consider changing the resolution of your monitor. You'll be better off with a low resolution - fewer pixels on the screen, but larger. That will make everything on the UI larger.\n\nIf you're using a laptop, I highly recommend getting an external monitor. It will be life-changing. And they're not expensive - a 10-year-old used monitor will work just fine. You don't need fancy, just physically large.\n\nNext, Jupyter Notebook has themes, here's a tutorial. A dark theme might work better for you, or just otherwise adjust the colors to your taste.\n\n[https://saturncloud.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-dark-mode-a-step-by-step-guide/](https://saturncloud.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-dark-mode-a-step-by-step-guide/)\n\nIf you're not doing mostly machine learning and working with numerical data and plots, you'll be better off with a tool like Visual Studio Code, which has amazing accessibility themes and features. It works great with both Python and Java.\n\nAlso check out the accessibility settings on your operating system, whether Windows or Mac - there are tons of features intended for people just like you. Get a large, brightly-colored mouse cursor, keyboard shortcuts to zoom in on anything, and much more.",

And the big tech firms are all kings of this. Google has a handful of products that make stupid amounts of money, and everything else is just for vanity or politics. If you're in one of those core teams, then there will be pressure to perform and also likely lots of scrutiny. And if you're far away from the money-makers your job is to make the pencil pushers who justify your pay cheque happy.\n\nBig companies I've worked at and have had colleagues work at also seem to prefer a lot more paperwork and documentation so that they can waterfall all the most cost sensitive parts of their business to offshore teams in countries with lower costs of living. This seems to make it more cost effective to build software, but also to protect all the IP.\n\nSome advice I was given is that as an individual at one of these organizations. You can barely see the tip of the iceberg. The culture, history, and trajectory of the part of the business you're in are all potentially decided by people far away. You're literally a cog in the wheel, and whether you fight it or go with it the business is doing exactly what it has planned to do.",

Internally there's very little travel and expenses budgets, morale events are gone and often paid by managers, no free food or snacks, the equipment is cheap, internal IT is garbage tier, we had to fight to get replacement computers. Also, those bonuses were structured in a way to be weaponized. You NEVER hit max bonus and more often hit midpoint or less if the manager just disliked you.\n\n\nPeople like to joke about Amazon's \"frugality\" leadership principle. But there's a difference between the definition of frugal (pay for just enough) and Microsoft's cheapness.\n\nEdit: Let me add one more cheap thing. Microsoft just had their 50th Anniversary. I would say that's quite a milestone for a big company, right? Let's just say when Windows 11 came out, we all got to pick out pretty fantastic goodies (sweaters, premium jackets, memorabilia's, etc.). For the 50th...I got to pick out a Teams background.

There's always been a bottleneck at juniors as juniors don't make money for companies, they cost money. Companies train juniors so that they can become seniors later and the number of seniors wont go down (causing senior salaries to spike), but now lots of companies are betting on AI becoming the new Seniors of the future so many have stopped investing in creating seniors out of juniors.

But I may be naive on that.\n\n>Will this subside, and is a CS degree becoming less worth it?\n\nDepends what happens with AI. Either it will wipe out most development jobs and we'll all be screwed, or it wont and we'll all keep working. There's no way to know because there's no way to know what the AI will be capable of next year, let alone five years down the road.\n\nIf I had to bet, I'd bet on it taking 5-10 years and then AI will be wiping out most jobs, and either societies will have some form of UBI, or societies will be devolving into violence and anger at the rich.\n\nCS degrees are already becoming worth less (not worthless) as our salaries are dropping over the past 3 years, but that doesn't mean people shouldn't learn CS, it's still a good job and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Plus if you like programming, it's a great hobby that you can use to build things you want/like, or create entrepreneurial ventures with. If AI takes over, there wont be money in it, but there wont be money in almost  anything at that point, so you're best off still learning what you enjoy and hoping those in positions of power are smart enough to see the violence coming and giving people a basic living wage paid for by the AI and the rich, then we can spend our free time coding whatever we want for fun.",

It is currently at the lowest point in those 24 months, too.\n\nSoftware is sitting at 62.9% job postings compared to pre-COVID.\n\nIT Operations and Helpdesk also plummeted, though not as bad... until inauguration day. Then it tanked from 84.6% on Jan. 21st, 2025--to 69% (nice) today.\n\nOn top of this, Science and R&D jobs dropped from inauguration day, as well. Going from 88.5% to 73.9%, in just 5 short months.\n\nIn that timeframe, there have been more graduates than ever before for these sectors.\n\nSo, I would say, yes. Software engineering is probably dead for now. And it probably will be for another 3 years and 7 months. Give or take.\n\nWe currently live in a world where a huge dumbass can take a profitable company (hell, an *industry*) and turn it into a bankrupt one... by simply signing some papers.

Nor that software is a totally unreasonable thing to invest time in.

Every ten or so people you add to an organization, the dynamic will change rapidly and you'll need to retune the operations.

Just like with software engineering, this really depends on your company, team, and role. Furthermore, work hours are consistently brutal across the entire industry during tax season; expect 80-100 hours a week in the first quarter and 60+ during the extension period. My WLB as a SWE is significantly better than all the accountants I know.\n\nLastly, accounting is just as vulnerable to being replaced by AI as our own, which you probably don’t realize because you don’t spend time in those circles and/or they don’t complain about it as much as we do. Just do a quick Google search for AI accounting tools and look at how many results pop up.\n\nThe only thing accounting has on software engineering right now is stability, but if you want more stability for generally shittier pay there’s way better jobs for that.",

        "body": "Investors want profit, which is revenue minus costs. Software needs developers, which are expensive. The big promise of AI is to drastically slash software development costs. There are a couple of ways for doing that:\n\n* By allowing less skilled folks to create good-enough software without having to pay experienced developers. Here, AI tools compete with the low-code/no-code industry. Nothing new.\n* By making good developers more productive. This is where AI-based code completion comes in.\n* By having the AI system independently solve high-level tasks. This is the dream of “agentic AI”.\n\nIt doesn't matter for AI companies if there will be fewer mid-skilled developers buying their subscriptions. A client company wants to get some amount of software development done. In theory, it can achieve this by some mix of humans and AI tools. Choosing some amount of AI is an economic win-win situation if AI-productivity is more cost-effective than human-productivity. But this means the price cap of an AI tool subscription isn't hundreds of dollars per month, but whatever it would cost to hire another human developer. And good developers are quite expensive.\n\nNow the neat thing for AI companies is that they don't have to realize these productivity gains themselves. They just have to convince other businesses that there *could* be productivity gains using these tools, that everyone else is doing it, and that your investors will start asking questions if you don't also jump on the hype train.\n\nIn a gold rush, sell shovels.\n\nThe problem here is that AI tools aren't cost-effective (yet). They are generally not cost-effective for users due to quite uneven quality, and they're not sold at-cost by the tool providers, because GPUs are so dang expensive. Currently, the field is propelled by the belief that the economics will work out soon™.\n\nPersonally, I'm fairly relaxed about this. AI-written code is generally well below my skill-level (especially when taking architecture and design concerns into account), and I don't see a plausible path for AI to catch up. Ever-bigger models with ever-larger context windows cost exponentially more, which could mean that the productivity:cost break-even point for high-skill activities like software development is never reached before the tool providers go bankrupt. There are also systematic problems, like software projects having a lot of implicit and oral context that is not available to an LLM.\n\nAI is probably here to stay, but software developers are some of the last folks who have to worry about this.",

One thing he continuously emphasized is that it's a *copilot*. We are still the pilots. He himself said that the most dangerous thing about Copilot, and the biggest disasters he's seen, are people that trust it. Copilot is a tool that can help us quickly get through mundane tasks. It is not a resource that can be used to blindly generate code we ship to production. *The creators* are telling us that it should not be used for blind code generation. That's telling.\n\nA funny thing about those trainings that I noticed is that the instructor himself struggled a lot during all his demos because the AI wouldn't co-operate, and he had to live debug why things weren't working the way he wanted. It's very telling when a *live demo to a major customer* goes haywire.\n\nI use AI the exact same way I use StackOverflow. It's a tool to get me information, or get quick answers to mundane tasks. It's *not* something I just copy/paste. It *augments* my abilities, it doesn't generate my code. It's just a faster Google, and Google/StackOverflow results also need to be taken with a big ass grain of salt.",

Now apply the exemplar pattern to feature B,\"\n\n\nAnd it would do a good job of correctly implementing the pattern and saved a substantial amount of time. It'd get things wrong here and there and always needed a clean up, but overall it did about as well as a decent intern.\n\n\nAnd then I started giving a little more latitude. I wrote out a requirements document for a new feature, got it to analyze the code base again, feed it the requirements document and worked through it with it.\n\n\nIt did a reasonable job of putting together code that met the requirements. I did catch it trying to cheat on the unit tests, very badly. Something it definitely learnt from the unit tests in its training data. It did hallucinate a few things and left some half implemented code it had started and then deserted lying around. The worst thing I caught it doing was going of and off and making changes to completely unrelated code that would've broken things.\nBut overall, it's output was mediocre AF. It was messy, convoluted, had nonsensical functions it had added and forgotten about, barely conformed to the patterns required.\n\n\nSo next session, I loaded it up and ask it to review the code base, it does so and comes back with \"Areas of the code are well designed and implemented, with clean code and adheres to best practices, but feature XYZ contains numerous errors, technical debt and fails to meet the same stand as the rest of the code\". Feature XYZ was the feature I'd asked it to implement. So at least it was able to identify that it's output was garbage. I did let it have a go at clean up it's mess, but it just made it worse to the point I had to roll back all the changes fir the session and then went and cleaned it up myself. So no time was saved that day.\n\n\nSo lesson here is, just like with juniors, if you give it a well crafted exemplar to learn from, it'll do an acceptable job of implementing code  based on that. But, just like with juniors, if you give it a requirements document and turn it loose on a new feature, it'll get the job mostly done, but it'll be ugly as all hell and need a fair bit of work to get it over the line.\n\n\nBut where the junior wins out is in when you send the work back, show them the exemplar and get them to rework things, the junior won't usually make things worse.",

They produce code no where near JR levels and most mid to sr employees spend more time fighting the AI to do basic shit that it takes away from business goals. \n\nOk now why are companies claiming they are getting gains?? Well it's simple. Money. Managers and execs make more money by laying off employees and squeezing the existing labor for all it's worth. And also they know the products are going to be absolutely garbage but they do not give a fuck as long as they have that multi year contract linked.\n\nThey set up deals like a house if cards, demand massive bonuses, pay PR firms to fluff their profiles, then bounce before it all comes down. It's a game of musical chairs and hot potato all at once. That's it.\n\nOh and the final bonus to all this behavior is it brings wages down.

Sounds like you did your best, so you should be proud, even if it's hard.\n\nAnother thing – you are not your work. Maybe it's worth taking some time to consider how much of your personal identity is entangled with producing shareholder value.

If a company needs to cut corners or decides to move positions offshore, there isn't much you can do about it.  You could have been picked due to performance, salary, age, likability.

Do all of the things you hear about such as formatting your resume and cover letters for each application.  ChatGPT and Grok make it easy.  It's a stupid game that we all have to play now.  I've had recruiters admit that they only look at the top 3-5 resumes that some AI spits out to them after receiving hundreds.\n\nKeep a log of who you apply to so you have the info handy when a company contacts you 6 weeks later saying your resume impressed them and you have no idea who they are or the position you applied to.  OneNote is great for this.  It also makes it easy and organized to fill out unemployment claims.\n\nStart being frugal with your money now.  Life is expensive and your savings will go fast.\n\nBiggest thing is stay positive.  Looking for a job when you are unemployed is a grueling process and it's easy to get depressed.

Your company has an information/support problem. Because there's no documentation, or proper support, or any sort of information distribution to the rest of the company, you're getting pinged constantly. You're being pulled into meetings that don't actually need you, just because ***you're*** the documentation. They want you there just in case. Going into a meeting without you would be like trying to code without Google. When people run into issues they ping you because ***you're Google***.\n\nYou can fix that. Just setting up a random Teams channel and telling them to send their questions there is a start, but it's not enough. Also, it's useless if you keep answering direct-pings. If you get direct pings, politely redirect them to the dev channel. You don't need to come off as if you're avoiding helping them, you can hide it under the guise of \"visibility\" to others.\n\nBut the \"Go-To Person\" at a company that *doesn't* suffer from that is the person management comes to when they need to *get shit done*. They aren't going to waste your talents asnwering stupid questions in a support channel. When there's some really hard task that *needs* to be done fast, and right the first time, they point immediately at the \"Go-To Person\", they don't want to risk giving that ticket to anyone else in the team. You're the tool they use when they don't have any margin for error, because they know you don't need any.\n\n*That's* my experience as the \"Go-To Person\". I always naturally fall into that role, and its great. I've done some awesome things, I've pulled some miracles, I get interesting work, I have the trust of my management.

A Bachelor of Science vs a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, so maybe that explains it?\n\nComputer Science degrees can fall under either. My CS degree is a BSE for example, but you could get either at my school. If you got your CS degree through the liberal arts school, you'd get a BS. If you got it through the engineering school, you'd get a BSE. But the core program requirements were identical, there was just some minor differences in electives.\n\nIf that's the case, maybe you could consider pursuing an MSE?

Make it known internally you want some growth on that side. If you’re currently unemployed, it’ll be an uphill battle for sure.

But to optimize an application for high throughput, low latency, and fault tolerance at large scale? That typically requires years of experience to understand the tradeoffs and foresee bottlenecks before they throttle you.\n\nDepending on your subfield, handling traffic at scale may also require not simply writing performant code but also using specialized tooling that you’d have no reason to learn at lower scale.\n\nSo yes, developing at scale requires significant skills beyond what your run-of-the-mill dev will bring to the table.",

Because the former parent company never invested much in the operation, all of the databases, for all of the applications sat on a single cluster of servers. They did not remotely have the ability to scale those applications. Having to think about servicing 10,000 times more clients was an exercise nobody in that organization ever had to experience. We were able to get away with throwing a slightly larger EC2 instance at the problem.\n\nIn short, I think it is a skill set and experience that not as many developers have. We were allowed to bring down the applications for four hours each month for maintenance. Lots of companies can't do that.",

The fact that you are getting on-sites makes me think it's going better for you than you may feel. A lot of people aren't getting call backs or past a first interview. \n\nI imagine the big issues is that you are probably going to be in a junior, or at best, a mid level development position and those are already rare nowadays. I can imagine it would be hard to land a senior position when you don't have proper dev experience. Is there a reason why you haven't tried to pivot to a team lead/management role already? I know that doesn't get you into development, but it could potentially be a smart career move for someone at your level of expertise. \n\nFrom the development side, I do work with someone who switched from sales to dev later in life ( like maybe mid 40s ). He did a bootcamp, but the thing that helped him start getting interviews was contributing to open source projects. They helped him have a commit history he could point to in github and show he was able to work with other developers and follow a bit of a process on a large scale project. He's great and brings a lot to our team and also has a lot of work experience that most of the team doesn't, which is a plus. \n\nI think the biggest issue is finding a team that matches your skillset.Starting out the best position is the one you can get, but you might be at a place in life where you can't take on just any job. You are probably making bigger considerations around time commitments, location, pay, ect.. which might be limiting you a bit. If you have flexibility on any of those, you might be able to expand your search and find something. \n\nAnother option could be to lean harder into your support experience. I'm in the process of transitioning a more support heavy development position. We will have a dedicated support team that will be fully focused on development support. I don't have any hiring capacity for this year unfortunately since it's a very new thing, but I'd be interested in candidates with a heavier support background. Most developers are not interested in doing support, especially when it's something they have to do with some frequency. They want to build and refine features. So, being the person who is both good and support and happy to do it could set you apart if you find the right position/company. \n\nWish I had even better advise. I think it's universally agreed on that getting the first development job is the hardest. One you land that, it'll still be hard, but maybe not as hard as the first time.",

Probably not (unless you're trying to break into game dev).\n\nWill it hurt you? Probably not.\n\nIt *could* tangentially help you by way of building skills you might otherwise not use and strengthening fundamentals like DS&A. Self learning is always a skill to keep as strong as possible, too.\n\nBut everything has an opportunity cost. What field do you want to work in? What stacks (if any)? I know you previously mentioned Java/Kotlin and Android dev. Something to consider is whether you want to work in that field, or if you are applying only because you feel strongest in it.\n\nGame dev is an entirely different beast. Personally, I'm into game dev myself because I learn almost exclusively from doing. I don't work in game dev. I don't publish games. I build them (and plenty of other things) to scratch that curiosity itch to learn while keeping it interesting (for example, I couldn't care less about yet another fucking library that's going viral that everyone is raving about in X language for Y framework--I'm not on the bleeding edge and it is not my niche).\n\nTL;DR: do it, if you're interested. The only downside is opportunity cost. Honestly ask yourself: what else would you be doing if not learning some game dev? Everything has an opportunity cost. Grinding leetcode has it. Learning tons of frameworks have it. But it doesn't hurt to spend a month on something to figure out if you're genuinely interested in it.\n\n  \nEdit: and you'll probably get lots of conflicting answers here. Were I interviewing you, I'd be **very** interested in your hypothetical game dev journey because of my own interest. Win some, lose some. It's a shitty market no matter what so find something to just keep you learning but not burned out.",

While here, I've worked on a wide array of different projects, even though I started in an embedded systems role. Through multiple management decisions, my team and I have worked on many projects outside of our domain, to the point where it looks like I'm completely lying on my resume. When I began, I was working primarily in Android development where I would work in Java and some additional Python scripts for automation. Then I worked on another project where I was mainly doing Python and some PowerShell and Bash scripting. After that, I did Python for a while but got exposed to microservice architecture, and found myself working a whole lot with Docker, RabbitMQ, and various other technologies.\n\nAfterwards I pivoted again to a new project which was more web-centric, and found myself developing using Java Spring Boot for the backend, and React for our frontend.\n\nAnother pivot, and I spent quite some time doing Data Science/Analytics for numerous stakeholders; during this time I found myself writing numerous SQL queries, working a lot in Jupyter Notebook in Python, and also dabbling in Machine Learning.\n\nMy most recent pivot I've been working with Django to build a web service, and again working with microservice architecture, and doing a whole lot of database work again.\n\nMy transitions have been quite extreme over the last several years, going from embedded systems, to data science/ML, to web development, and so on. I feel the same way in the sense that I don't know if I have much of a specialization either, but it's nice to be able to learn so much!",

They’ll integrate AI as much as they can, it might even go full circle as the AI is not upto it, so they get developers back in.\n\nYour degree will always be a great thing to have and use even if not in tech.\n\nJust my two cents. I think you have to look at it realistically and I think a lot of people across industries are in denial, until their (freelance) work dries up or layoffs occur.\n\nI’ll be downvoted because people won’t like to hear it.\n\nEdit: Just do your course, stay away from subs like these to keep yourself motivated.",

Get involved in your own personal projects that might make other peoples jobs or lives easier, take inspiration from your past work, hobbies or those of people you know. Research and apply to every internship you can find; I've noticed there isn't a huge internship grind among comp sci students. Building those connections and gaining experience is huge to finding a job. Also, have a wider view of your career expectations. There is a lot of work that doesn't fit the typical mold like service desk or support analyst jobs but can really help you connect with stakeholders and build management experience. In line with that and as general advice, make yourself flexible and don't feel like you can only focus on one aspect of the field. Try things or apply to jobs you may not feel comfortable with or not have the experience for.",

An unhappy person could really ruin this for people trying to help or people trying to get their foot in the door.\n\nWould love to see this fleshed out more, I would love to volunteer my time in a more lead/manager position since that is something I'd be interested in exploring as a full time IC as well, especially since I have experience with mentorship.",

My department has 3 and then the number of devs we have is like 40. AI will trim the number of SWEs for many organizations, if it hasn’t already, NOT as dramatically as Infra was by virtualization and IaC, but there’s no lower level devs anymore in my org. Just mid to senior. Who knows, my org may be able to do the work of the 40 SWEs with 25-30 in a few years, there will still be 3 Infra guys though.\n\nTo add, most companies are not full on automation either. There are still many several traditional companies that don’t have a need for IaC like larger companies. This will also be downvoted, but a lot of SWEs really can’t do Infra work…..

The audience is a faceless, silent crowd that's intensely judging us. It's not a bunch of normal people just sitting in seats. The \"higher up\" is some intense figure looking for any reason to fire us. They're not a normal person who's just doing their job, no different from us.\n\nOur brains don't see these people as people. Even in your title, you're not referring to a person, you very intentionally used the word \"higher up\". That's what makes us nervous, what our imagined view of these people is.\n\nStart reminding yourself that these people are people.

It doesn't matter what some online collective decides. \n\nIt might also just be case that another candidate came off looking better for whatever reason. From a human perspective, it's great that you have balance, etc. But from a work perspective, there are likely people who will prefer someone who may bring more work value. I cringe a bit as I type that, but hopefully you get my point. A person's personality and values can certainly improve and add value to a company, but I was recently in some crunch mode on a project, and a few new devs decided they wanted work-life balance. It's good for them to set boundaries, but it can also make things more difficult. I'm trying to balance doing what's right vs what is sometimes practical.",

Most of it was as a developer at a boutique consulting firm, and I stuck with the same client for about 3 years, a large at home healthcare company. Then bounced around other clients for a little over a year before we had a bad quarter and a headcount reduction. I got another job within the month building business software at a major auto manufacturer. \n\nAll that said, here's something I wish I knew 5 years ago. \n\nThe technical stuff, coding, architecture, deployments, are NOT the toughest part of the job. There's a good chance that coding is the easiest part of your work. It's working with and meeting the often inconsistent expectations of clients, product managers, stakeholders, and business analysts that will make your job hard. But, the good thing about that, is the better you learn to understand these people's perspectives and speak their language instead of nerd gibberish, you will be so much more valuable to your team. It's one thing to be a good coder, but when you're a good coder who can get the non-technical decision makers on your side, you become the person who GETS THINGS DONE. \n\nI inherited my current position from someone who was a good developer, but a really poor communicator. He didn't set expectations and just said whatever he needed to so people would stop asking him to explain. He developed a notorious reputation in the other departments as someone who didn't make sense and couldn't deliver. The tough part was he actually was a good developer, but people who didn't trust him tried to get in his way. \n\nLong story short, even though you're a developer, educate yourself in the business as a whole. Ask people from other departments about what they do and what their pain points are. Take their perspectives into account when it's appropriate and let them know that you're doing that (in a humble way, of course). You'll be an asset to the company as a whole and unique opportunities may open up.",

        "body": "I worked as a dev intern for a year and so the following could help you out as well:\n\n\\- It's ok to not know things. If you don't know something, anything that you don't know how to do/don't get/understand, ask for help. Do a bit of research first but do not spend more than an hour. If you are clueless on something even after an hour, just ask for help\n\n\\- When you have learned something new, take notes on it\n\n\\- Work on challenging tickets. It's the best way to learn things quickly\n\n\\- If you are working with a tech stack/tools you are not familiar with/you are new to it, work on a project that uses the tech stack/tools\n\n\\- Before you do something like make a PR for instance, ask what the company's convention/process is. Sometimes they may want you to write a PR in a certain way as an example. This goes for documentation, git commits, code as well. Pretty much anything where you need to do something for the company\n\n\\- Don't focus so much on documenting things when you are working on a ticket. Document for you, not for the company. But if the senior dev asks you to document something, then document. E.g., say you are working on something new, don't spend so much time neatly documenting an activity diagram or a sequence diagram. Focus on the dev work. If the company wants you to create a documentation, then document it. Not all documentation are useful for the company\n\n\\- Don't share anything personal/personal life issues. Colleagues may form negative opinions about you. This is like fitting into the company politics, if you don't fit, then you may be seen undesirable from a social point of view. Just keep it positive and professional\n\n\\- Company may have certain events or even activities like weekly soccer or board games. They may even have an internal committee where they are responsible for holding team related events/activities. Join them to maintain and improve relationships with the people in your company\n\n\\- At least when I did my internship, they valued efficiency. If you can complete work quickly and if you are able to take on work quickly, you will be seen as a highly valuable employee, you will get promoted easily\n\nThat's all I can think of right now, I may add more if I can think of anything else.",

You have that half in spades, you definitely are working hard and maybe a bit too hard (5000 applications in 8 months is nuts, thats close to 160 applications daily without any breaks). The other half is working smart. When you are looking for a job, you are selling your particular skillset to the company. Do you reflect on the applications that you do send in or do you just mass apply? How are you proving to the companies that you are sending these applications that you are indeed the best candidate?\n\nI am not saying that all of this is your fault either, the job market is fucked, but you don't control the market and neither do I, I am simply saying the things that are in your control which should be the primary focus.\n\nFor the masters question, do you think it will lower your chances, raise your chances, or keep them the same? That is how I would make my decision. If you answer that you don't know then you should be asking yourself questions to find out. For example, if you are looking to hire a software engineer and you see 2 resumes that are identical except for the education section where one has a masters degree in computer science listed and one that has a boot camp degree that is listed, which one would you personally choose? Imo the answer is pretty clear there.\n\nYou have to remember I don't know you though, don't take what I am saying personally. I could go the route of telling you how unfair everything is and how I feel bad for you but that doesn't solve anything in relation to you having a job so I tried my best to instead challenge your process since its the only thing you control.",

If so, I would consider reaching out to company B but be ready for the answer that they may have already filled the position",

Or they need several hints for what boils down to basic string manipulation (check if a string is alphanumeric), not even DS&A assessment. \n\nWe can’t honestly recommend someone to our manager who can’t problem solve or code through a short problem without AI assistance/google. \n\nAnd then there’s a good chunk of candidates that are just obviously cheating and even some not obvious but our tools picked up so those are instant no call backs.

The question is that if you never used these, you have no clue on how it works.\n\nIf at your job you use AWS, then try to solve these problems (or realize the shortcomings) with some tools that AWS provides (DynamoDb, SQS, etc). Then you can learn why Dynamodb might be a better option over Redis or something, even if you've never used Redis.\n\nIf you are not currently employed and are still a new grad looking for an entry position - usually system design isn't a part of the interview process because it's hard without on-field experience.",

They cover a lot of the same ground as LeetCode problems but in a more theoretical sense. As for actual practice, start by trying to design a simple system like a blog comment section or a user authentication system - it'll help you get your feet wet with thinking through scalability and performance.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper, I've used an AI tool that listens to system design interview questions and suggests responses in real time. If you're interested, I can share it with you. Keep at it, and don't worry if it takes a few weeks or even months to get the hang of it - the more you practice, the better you'll understand these concepts!",

After all the big comapnies got rid of wfh, I've never had a friend struggle for a tech job in Seattle, atlanta, or the bay in the past year even with the recession or they were new grads.  \n\n##what does that mean for you?\nQA, Dev ops, web dev ( just be a freelancer at first to build your portfolio ) all of these can be found at entry level. The issue people don't wanna accept is that entry level **requires past experience** the same way an junior level doctor or lawyer requries past experience. \n\n##Examples\nLike for web dev, just do freelance contracts or programs like Dev for good. Not that hard to make a portfolio if you really liked it. \n\nFor ML, just work in a univeresity research lab; many of them are paid for every student they take on and your work gets published and used in industry. A lot will even take non-students (helping Columbia with their research actually landed me at Microsoft without an application)\n\nWanna do QA? Go to utest.com, get a few tests done and get paid for it and after 2 years you'd be overqualified for Jr roles. Don't even gotta apply just start and get paid like uber. \n\n##Bottom line\nIt's very doable, it's just not as \"easy\" as it was before. And believe it or not, most people for most well paid industries have to do this exact same thing.\n\nEdit: assuming you are willing to move to a tech hub... or at least apply to jobs with a address / PO box in a tech hub",

That'd be the better of the two options.\n\nHonestly, if you just want to maximize your chances of getting a job:\n\n1. Pick one major and do it really well. CS is ideal, but Data Science is totally fine.\n\n2. Do projects, go beyond what's required in class. Be curious. Try to really understand things.\n\n3. Apply for internships every summer. Do everything you can to get an internship. Use your career center, reach out to alums who graduated from your school recently, make friends with pros via open-source projects.\n\nUltimately those things matter more than a double-major or master's.\n\nDo the master's if you really want to learn some of the material that goes beyond undergraduate CS or DS, and you really want to learn it in an academic environment. Don't do it expecting an easier time finding a job or a higher salary, it won't help. However, it might be worth it if the subfield you want to go into is really advanced.",

Which data structures should you use and what algorithm will you use to process your data? Think of the space and time complexity and consider if you can improve that. It helps to write little notes. Only start coding *after* you have your entire solution mapped out. This process can help you identify any utility functions that you can stub out which will help prevent getting confused in a deeply nested loop. \n\nThis is how I practiced with LC, and I was able to finish all of my technicals with time to spare. I even had time to walk through the solution while writing down and updating the values for my variables and catch some bugs. This part is important for FAANG interviews and will likely get you a hire/strong hire decision. \n\nYou can get there with some good practice. You need to practice the correct way though.",

However, as I have been an interviewer myself, I know how unproductive this is and the impression this gives. I will therefore tell the interviewer directly: \"I prefer thinking in silence, but I will still do my best to give you an insight into my thought process\". \n\nThis helps me because I can now take a silence break whenever I feel like it without feeling bad about it. It helps the interviewer know what's going on because I have explicitly communicated it. \n\nOther than that, I believe a mindset shift is due here. Let me offer it: interviewer usually wants you to succeed. We want to get a new colleague and stop the interviews and just get back to our day to day job. Very rarely people will use the interview process to bully you and nitpick. And if they do, this is not a place I want to work at. I mean this. I have experienced this, laughed back at the interviewer and hung up the conversation after saying \"thanks, this was enough information for me\". \n\nSo, the more you communicate with the interviewer (who wants you to succeed), the more they will be able to help you out, throw you a bone here and there if you're struggling or outright tell you \"this is not what I am looking for\". When you start believing this person wants to help you, you'll naturally want to use this leverage. Definitely use it. \n\nA final piece of advice would be to ask a lot of questions yourself. Intelligent, directional, intentional questions. This gives you a lot more information to work with, which makes you more confident in what you're doing, which makes you calm down and be able to communicate. It additionally allows you to showcase your maturity while being on the \"offense\", so even if you have some hiccups during the coding, you give yourself better chances. \n\nHope this helps!\n\nFeel free to DM me as well, if you wanna chat more about it",

But if you do enjoy problem-solving and are interested in software development, QE/SDET can be a great career path.\n\nThat being said, the tech industry is always changing, and QE/SDET roles at FAANG companies can be super competitive. It's possible that some people had bad experiences during the mass hiring era, but it sounds like your interview with this team was really positive. I would say that if you're genuinely interested in the role and think you'd be a good fit, it might be worth exploring further.\n\nOne thing that helped me when I was in a similar spot was using this AI tool that listens to interview questions and provides suggested responses in real time - it's not a magic solution, but it can help you feel more prepared.

Not sure on the cost of Spain, but you should come out of Amazon with a good bit of money saved if you budget well. I love travel so Spain is tempting, but if I had to choose, I think Amazon is better career wise. But seriously with Amazon's pay you should be able to do both ( as long as you are getting paid in Spain).",
