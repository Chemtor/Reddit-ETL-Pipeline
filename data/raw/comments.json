Then, when the call started, the guy had a super common Brazilian name, so my husband greeted him in Portuguese — but the candidate replied saying he preferred English because his Portuguese wasn’t great, and actually, he wasn’t from Brazil. That was a bit of a red flag, especially since his resume said he graduated from a public university in Brazil (where it’s rare to have classes in anything other than Portuguese).\n\nHe turned his camera on for a second, then quickly turned it off saying his internet was unstable. My husband mentioned he seemed to be of Asian descent, but it was hard to say for sure. Weirdly enough, the guy still managed to answer some pretty tough Java questions and even spotted issues in code with no problem.\n\nA few days later, we randomly saw a video showing AI tech that can fake someone’s face during a video call — the example showed a low-res, vaguely Asian-looking face... and it looked a lot like the guy from the interview. 🫠",

Some of our jobs run for a very long time in spark due to the hive partition not being ideal. These will run very quickly in redshift because our distkey is much better for the type of pulls we need.

But there are a few points I don't entirely agree with.\n\nI also work for a company that is relatively reasonable in its tech stack. We only have a few TB of data for more than 10 years of operations and most of it runs on an on-prem setup using mostly open source tools. No cloud bloat or any of that.\n\n> There’s a tool for ingestion. A tool for orchestration. A tool for transformation, reverse ETL, governance, monitoring and if you’re lucky, a tool for remembering why you started this project in the first place.\n\nI'm a big ELT proponent. Part of the ELT philosophy is that each part of your pipeline performs as few tasks as logically necessary.\n\nMy ingest/outgest scripts run in python and they *only* do ingest/outgest. They don't perform a single transformation unless they absolutely have to.\n\nI run my transformations with dbt.\n\nI schedule my jobs with Airflow. I don't really see how I would orchestrate my pipeline unless with an orchestrator (CRON would also do fine). Or does the author imply we should have an alarms set somewhere so we can manually run these singular scripts he seems to such a big fan of?\n\n> But here’s the secret the consultants won’t tell you:\n> Fewer moving parts means fewer bugs. Faster answers. A fighting chance that someone on your team actually understands what the hell is going on.\nOne script. One machine. One person who can debug it without a PhD in vendor certifications.\n\nI have seen these 'One script. One machine. One person.' solutions he's talking about. I've made a bit of a career out of refactoring them. Often that 'One person' fucked off some place else and now no one understands this one script that is taking 40 minutes to run every 30 minutes.\n\nThese one scripts typically had hundreds of moving parts that seemed to perform tasks with varying degrees of usefulness and efficiency. Except it's almost impossible to figure out what part does what since it's all thrown together.\n\nIf you One Script performs ingest/outgest and transform at the same time, good luck debugging your hot mess. If something goes wrong you've now got hundreds of lines of code to comb through to find the offending part.\n\nWhen something goes wrong in my stack, debugging is easy as hell.\n\nDoes the problem happen between the source and my RAW schema? Well, just look in the ingestion scripts. Is it between RAW and the final data set? Check the dbt queries. Is it between the final data set and the consumer? Check the outgest scripts.\n\nWhen each moving part performs a single, clearly defined task, debugging is a lot easier.\n\nYes, it is true in engineering that fewer moving parts typically means a less complex system, trying to cram as many functionalities in as few moving parts as possible is also not the best idea in general.\n\nImagine building a house and having your water and your electricity lines all using the same pipes in the wall/floor. Sure, you've got to install fewer pipes, but good luck when one of your water lines has a leak.",

From the way you describe it, it doesn't sound like that's who you want to become. You're doing the right thing right now by going with the flow and getting things done, but I'd advise talking to your manager about the trajectory you want your career to go. If they insist on keeping your responsibilities like this, I'd probably leave sooner rather than later.

Spark, a warehouse, an operational database, *and* machine learning models... for just 4 tables?!\n\nAnd six hours of dataflows? That's like an hour and a half per table; that seems excessive.",

That'll make a significant cost decrease. \n* Dont stack tables on top of each other in layers if you dont really need to. e.g if your table is almost 1:1 from your staging to your gold layer make bronze and silver views then gold a table -- Conversely if some of your long running queries have a lot of joins on heavy views then make those incremental tables \n* Last one - heavy filters on CTEs where possible",

IMO that's not a basic tech stack, a cron pulling some data directly into powerbi is basic, that's a tech stack powered by three separate vendors that can get very expensive.\n\nThe first question is: are you part of the product the company is making or is it a cost center?  I assume you've priced out what it would cost and what you expect it to cost in a year, in addition to how long you think it would take to move to that stack?  So that's the first place you can sell it, that it will return you more money as part of a better/more robust product feature or that it will be cheaper overall than paying devs to maintain these scripts.\n\nThe second question is: what does it give you that you don't already have?  A very reasonable question you might receive is 'yes it's a hack but it's working for us, is rewriting it the most important thing to be pursuing at this time?'  Like if all the data is there and I just want to see a report about how many frobnozzles we foobricked and or how much uptake my great new feature is getting and you're like 'first we should rewrite the entire tech stack' you need to be able to articulate the value of it beyond 'these JS scripts offend my aesthetic sensibilities'\n\nThe third question I would ask is what are the long-term expectations of you in this role because IMO startups don't actually need DEs, but since titles in this industry are relatively meaningless, it's possible that what they really want right now is a 'data analyst' (often code for 'pbi monkey'), so the third question to me are everyones expectations aligned here?  Then maybe outline a plan for an incremental move to this stack you want.",

Everything you put effort into needs to be laser focussed on reducing the chance of both those things happening.\n\nI'm not convinced a data warehouse is the right move if your manager doesn't think it is. You can build and retrofit one down the line when there's a compelling reason and/or enough stability in the company's economics. I say this as a lover of data warehouses, Kimball, Roche's Maxim, and good data architecture in general: but there's a time and a place.\n\nMy employer, a ~500 person publicly traded company, managed for _many years_ without a data warehouse, pulling data directly into Power BI from quite a few different business applications, with a lot of logic repetition between different semantic models. Would it have been easier if they'd done a DW from the outset, long before I joined? Yes, but then adoption of Power BI might not have taken off and the whole initiative could have been binned.\n\nMuch better to provide business value quickly, in a way that's horrible behind the scenes, and then sort it out incrementally while adding more business value steadily. Kimball even advocates for this quite explicitly in DWTK!",

I really want to emphasize that before my next comments, as you did ask for a roast =). Also really appreciate you showing your limitations and where you asked for help in this. \n\nNow for the actual roast part...\n\nWhile I have no issue with the whole ETL as a tech process and completely agree with it, I wonder if going for a full analytics/column-based solution as your destination was the right call here. From what I understood, you want the users of your product to be able to look up the weather for their next climb. Meaning your back will probably have to serve data a couple of rows at a time, at most. Look up a crag, get the weather, yeah no it's bad, look up next crag, and so on. But no aggregation on the average yearly temperature at 6pm every day on all the crags in Cumbria. The first example is a row based workload, or transactional; the second is columnar, analytical. Parquet and duckdb are really good at the latter, no so much at the former.\n\nI understand you tried using PostgreSQL then failed and went to duckdb in order to make some progress, that's good. Going forward I really think you should give PostgreSQL another try, it's way better suited to what you want to do. Also it has a great extension (postgis) to deal with geodata, which you will need to. For the same reason I think you would benefit from reconsidering your data model, as I think a fact/dim approach is going to be deserving you. Your model feels like you had to forcefully bend it in order to fit in. Sure, it works, but there's a lot of tension between your data and the model. Don't know how to express it otherwise.\n\nHope it helps, don't hesitate if you have questions, I'd be happy to provide further guidance if needed.",

I would say Python is a quick and easy language that is the most broadly used in data. So learn it.\n \nOrchestrate: airflow has been around a long time and is very good. Some people tend to say it’s way harder to get setup than the “new” stuff. Usually they used an old version were a lot of things needed to be managed for the system to run correctly. Then you have “new” orchestrator in the market which try to make it easy like Dagster, prefect, mage.\n\nClean and transformation : you have the python frameworks (pandas, polars), you have your sql engine (DBT, trino, presto), you have spark, you have your DuckDB.\n\nMost compagnie would be fine with an up to date version of Postgres. But they usually run old 2010 version of sqlserver that run REAL slow, so they think they have a lot of data and switch to an OLAP system when they migrate. If you heard something like I have a LOT of data to transform. 1 million rows, 10 million rows, 100 millions rows you can assume that the company DOESN’T have a lot of data at all. And that any db would work. If it’s 100 millions rows every hour that’s another thing but usually people talk about their global table size unless they have really a lot of data and usually when they do they already know the solution because they already hit issues so many times with their systems.\n\nFor OLAP (managed) you have snowflake, Databricks BigQuery, Redshift.\nOLAP (OSS) Pinot, clickhouse\n\nThere’s a lot more but that cover most scenarios or “new” company\n\n\nAccess : you have a bunch of tools here but like tableau, power bi, sigma if you are 100% snowflake, metabase for small company, superset for bigger. And a bunch more.\n\nSo no real definitive stack but you have those.\n\nIf I was to start fresh in a new company that has received funding and that I know there’s going to be A LOT of data (multiple terabytes at least) I would probably do Dagster, DBT, snowflake, sigma, python ingestion in Dagster.\nWhy? Because if they have investors and the company is pretty small they want to delivers new things fast even if it cost them more. If the couple of new things works or fail fast then it’s good for the business, they’ll hire more and continue growing the business. And the stack is pretty much all managed so you pay for maintenance and upgrades and everything you don’t have to do those things, and you can focus on business requirement.\n\nIf it was a small company that expect a lot of data with no funding, I’ll go the datalake approach. Because snowflake will be expensive no matter what.\n\nIf you don’t have a lot of data Postgres Dagster python, DBT might be a good fit.\n\nThere no real stack but those are nice.\n\nPersonally I would always go with a sql framework for transformation at start not because it’s better just because sql is easy enough that mostly anyone can understand and build some stuff while python transformation can get confusing when you chain a bunch of stuff together and it require programming knowledge which not everyone has.\n\nGood luck",

It's important to understand that there's no direct value passing between task-decorated functions in Airflow (xcom is used for that). Note that I'm talking from my experience with Airflow 1.x and 2.x, and the newest 3.0 release may invalidate some of my knowledge :)\n\nAlways treat Airflow tasks as separate processes running on separate virtual machines, even if they aren't. It'll save you time when you decide to scale Airflow workers. E.g. use shared object storage or database to exchange the data between tasks. \n\nMake tasks granular enough for ease of retry and debugging.\n\nUse idempotency for complex data pipelines to its fullest. In Airflow, data\\_interval\\_start/end macros are leveraged for that.",

Use airflow for orchestrating not for data processing, while that is not a hard and fast rule, I see a lot of failures when workers run out of memory because their pandas ingested too much data. Worst part of that is, you loose all your logs, so it’s hard to work out what went wrong.  What to do? Track the size of data you are processing and compare them to the memory you have. If you see a trend that tells you you are headed for OOM situations, export the data processing function into a serverless option, be it a k8s pod or any other option.\n2. When you download files to a worker, make sure you clean it up reliably, to avoid running out of disk space eventually. Use the tempfiles module appropriately.\n3. Avoid large xcoms. It stresses the meta data db and impacts overall processing. If you have large data to pass between tasks, consider using external storage.\n4. Avoid dags that run more frequently than once every 10 minutes. The round robin nature of the scheduler means for a non trivial setup can exceed  several minutes and you may not be able to keep up.  \n5. Avoid dags that watch for file changes and do that every few minutes (as above). See if you can have an external file watcher trigger the day instead. Alternatively space it so it checks every 30 minutes.\n6. Review the day code for expensive functions at module level. The dag gets executed every few minutes and everything at module level gets run every few minutes. So variable.get uses your database, why stress it with hundreds and thousands of such calls. Move these into your python functions.\n7. Use logging but use it judiciously, your logs can end up in your metadata base, or at least in your file system. \n8. Monitor and manage the size of your metadata base. If it’s too big you can’t run snapshots/backups.",

I'm in a similar position where I'm kinda mostly just seeing this as a learning experience so I'm down to learn how to make optimizations first; however, that's admittedly mostly an excuse.\n\nNothing is stopping you from pushing out your MVP and learning to make practical optimizations. For example, maybe you won't really need to switch from DuckDB to Postgres, or for rethinking your data modelling, etc. Surely, these are things you likely will want to do later, but there may not be as much of a need.\n\n\"Premature optimization is the root of all evil.\" - Donald Knuth",

I work as a DE, so I get to play around there, but there I am limited with the tools I can use.\n\n  \nI see two paths for you. Either you make it a project you enjoy and people get value from it. But that here would mean making a useful website, and probably adding more data because if its just weather, people already know what sites are near them and its easy to just check the weather for those sites.\n\nThe other path is just going full on tinkering. I would suggest maybe getting some free cloud resources and use one of the big data warehouses in one of the clouds. Create tables there with DBT. Maybe your extra data can be weather history. Maybe there is a thermometer at some sites and you can check foretasted weather vs real weather.\n\n  \nOptimization is really not needed most of the time. You just make something that works, and only improve it when it stops working.",

You might get insight what you should improve on ETL side and most importantly it gives people option to actually do something with your work.\n\nI went through your code yesterday, it was really interesting. Good work! You can, for example, always add more or better data validation but what's point in that since your data source is relatively static and error in data isn't critical. Or make more efficient database schema for few thousand lines of data which is extremely little and databases handle that with ease, same goes for changing from DuckDB to PostgreSQL. You can always make better ETL process, or program, but if your goal is to get something out then you have to stop optimizing at some point and publish or finalize something.",

Incremental transition -- much higher complexity because each move needs to maintain compatibility with parts that haven't moved yet. ",

But IMO refactoring piece by piece is usually better than rebuilding from the ground up. \nA good starting place may be getting all of your code running on the same deployment pattern.

You copy from Prod data into UAT and test there to see if anything breaks, or, build in UAT pre-determined data with SQL scripts, so that results from any process / pipeline can be tested.\n\nSo test for missing columns, null data, business rules. This is also work-intensive, this approach, but DE-person agnostic. Have each DE that does a change, in JIRA, write some conditions for success. Have a person dedicated for the DevOps / UAT testing phase.\n\nA great place I worked at, every sprint rotation cycle, a different person was assigned the DevOps/UAT, so that we all gained the experience. Over time the code base improved.\n\nI've seen many companies not even have a DEV environment, only one, that is prod. Ideal is 3 environments, Dev, UAT, Prod. Since it's for dashboards / reporting, if something breaks, not an issue, we will fix today and tomorrow you'll have your data (maybe). So usually the VP that controls $$$$ says No Way, no multiple environments, we are not XYZ company.\n\nThen, you get to end-of-month, end-of-quarter, and a very angry VP (usually the same VP-Ahole) asking why he doesn't have his numbers at 8am for his afternoon presentation.\n\nIt's unfortunate - but remember this old & great Murphy's Law annectdote.\n\nIf architects built buildings the same way programmers built systems, the first woodpecker to come along would utterly destroy civilization. \n\nGreat reading, on The Register website, read the BOFH.

If you want a portfolio project for data engineering jobs, spin up a tiny Kubernetes or Ray cluster on something like AWS Spot nodes. Even a three-node run shows you can handle cloud orchestration.\n\nStreaming ingestion can be worth it if your target is “near real time” dashboards for devs watching new reviews flow in. Stick Kafka or Redpanda in front, keep micro-batches small, and output rolling aggregates to a cache. Transformer summarization can handle chunks of, say, 128 reviews at a time without killing latency.\n\nwith Dask on multiple nodes, workers sometimes drop off during long GPU jobs. Enable heartbeat checks and auto-retries.\n\nGood luck.",

The worker distribution helps with the cost as instead of a sequential run which took me 30 minutes to process a single file which contains 200k reviews, the current implementation takes 2 minutes to do the same. and the application is session based and does not run the whole time. I still have a few optimizations to do.\n\n  \nstreaming ingestion, though i mentioned it in the post, does not make sense right now because the steam reviews need to be extracted from their web API, since the application summarized millions of reviews, it would have to redo the whole process for the previous reviews as well as the new reviews which just came in. I could work on that as a future addition.\n\n  \nThank you for your input and would love to know more about how i can improve.

When a report user reports an issue, do I tell the BI engineer to just write their dbt models or design their dashboards differently? No because the source of the problem (the data) might also be causing issues elsewhere, it’s just not been reported yet, so I find the root cause and fix it as far upstream as possible so the fix benefits as many downstream assets as possible.\n\nWhen you write code do you write it in a text editor without an LSP, and discover all your syntax errors at compile time? Or god forbid, in the case of business logic mistakes, let your end users find and report the issue? No, you write code using LSP so you see syntax errors before your compiler does, you write unit tests so your business logic is verifiably correct, you write integration tests to make sure your unit works in correspondence with a larger system - these are all ways that we shift the problem discovery / fix left in the development cycle as much as possible.",

With that said, I feel qualified to speak on it as a data engineer given I've devoted the past ~3 years to this problem and I'm writing an O'Reilly book on the subject.\n\nFirst and foremost, \"shift left\" pulls from already established paradigms in security and DevOps; and applying that to data. The core problem in those two spaces was disparate and high volume changes that downstream teams could no longer manage, and thus responsibility needed to \"shift left\" to upstream software engineers to manage such requirements.\n\nKey to this is not just shifting responsibility, but making it as easy as possible for these upstream engineers to engage in the desired practices within their existing dev workflows. Thus \"shift left\" isn't respective to where you are in the data lifecycle (e.g. upstream vs downstream), it's clearly looking at application code if we are following the same patterns it was established in other domains mentioned earlier.\n\nThus, \"shift left\" in data revolves around prevention at \"design time\" as compared to \"run time\" like observability (both are valuable). This is why data contracts are core to the shift left narrative in data, as it validates if changes meet expectations within the CI/CD process.\n\nHere are some great resources if you want to learn more:\n\n1.

Then you have a claims where you need a 45 day runout because a single healthcare claim line can change a ton of times before it's actually approved or rejected but you have to capture everyone of those steps along the way. \n\nThen you always have to be prepared and ready for an audit by either someone internally in your org or someone from the government so your documentation and processes need to be on point.\n\nThe reason why we need people with experience in healthcare data is because it's very hard to ramp up people with 0 experience. When I bring on juniors to my team I don't expect them to \"get the data\" for like 24 to 36 months and even then you are always learning new parts or domains of healthcare data and probably still don't understand all the nuances around the data. \n\nIt's just easier to bring someone in that would have at least a clue about what a care plan resource in FHIR format looks like, how to load it, and how to extract from it.\n\nThe true gatekeeper is really the rules, regs, complexity and lack of enforced standardized format amongst all healthcare companies whether that be health plans, pbm's, provider groups, client groups, hospital groups, these middleware companies that claim to give you robust integrations... It's all a pile of steaming shit and we are the plumbers to keep it moving.",

If you have like 3 tables about the same thing and it make sense to just have 1 table you join them. \n\n\nThe second layer is where you test your data extensively. At this point there was no business rules applied or anything. Just renaming, retyping, null value handling at most. Your tests will return errors present in the system you extract. \n\n\nThird layer is where you add your business rules. I like to make one model for each business rule as dbt with duckdb takes like 1-2 seconds for 200k rows. Having multiple transformations together is exhausting to debug, and not really more efficient. \n\n\nForth layer is where I make my Kimball modeling. One fact for each thing I look at. Dimensions all around. Junk dimensions are build using a SELECT DISTINCT to only have values that happens. \n\n\nJust remember to generate surrogate keys with dbt so you can joins dimensions and facts using a single column. And never join facts together, it's not how a star model work. Having multiple facts inside a single powerbi dashboard works well if you keep it classy. Also remember for each dimensions to have a default value for missing keys. Like adding a \"missing customer\" to your customer dimension.\n\n\nLastly with dbt and surrogate keys you do not need to join fact and dimensions during the ETL phase as you do not need to use the foreign keys to retrieve the surrogate keys. It's weird to not have integers as surrogate keys but trust the process.",

Beautiful medallion architecture (bronze → silver → gold) that looked great in slides but was a nightmare to maintain. Every layer had schema changes, quality issues, debugging headaches. We spent more time figuring out which layer broke than building features.\n\nBreaking point: a simple schema change cascaded through 7 tables and killed reporting for two days. That's when we rebuilt everything around FITT principles.\n\nThe four FITT principles:\n\n1. Functional - Pure functions only. Same input = same output, always. Made everything immutable by default. Storage is cheap, debugging corrupt state at 2am isn't.\n\n2. Idempotent - Run it 1000 times, same result. Recovery = just re-run it. Junior devs actually experiment now instead of being terrified.\n\n3. Tested - Tests as architectural components. Every pipeline has data quality, business logic, and integration tests. They're living documentation.\n\n4. Two-stage - Raw → Final, that's it. Raw data stays immutable forever. Final data ready for consumption. Everything in between is ephemeral.\n\nWe ditched bronze/silver/gold entirely. Those layers were just arbitrary complexity.\n\nKey implementation patterns:\n\n\n\nDev/Prod split: Dev uses yesterday's data + today's code. Prod uses today's data + yesterday's code. Never deploy untested.\n\nGit as truth: Want results from 6 months ago? Check out that commit and re-run against raw data.\n\nIncremental processing: Each increment is idempotent. Run once or 50 times, same result.\n\n\n\nResults after:\n\n\n\nOn-call incidents dropped %\n\nNew hires productive in weeks, not months\n\nData quality issues caught in dev, not prod\n\nNo more mysterious data drift\n\n\n\nCommon pushback:\n\n\"Storage costs!\" - Compute is cheaper than engineering time.\n\n\"Performance?\" - Less debugging = more optimization time.\n\n\"Over-engineering?\" - Worth it if you have 3+ people on pipelines.\n\nGetting started:\n\n\n\nPick one pipeline that breaks a lot\n\nMake raw data immutable\n\nAdd comprehensive tests\n\nEliminate staging layers\n\nMake it idempotent\n\n\n\nFITT made data engineering boring again (in the best way). We went from hero-driven development to a system where anyone can contribute confidently.",

No need to overthink about patterns.\n\n> will each table of each datasource have its own set of functions or classes or whatever?\n\nNot sure what you are talking about. If you ask the self-glorious Analytic DEs (like me) who bath in the thought that we care oh so much about business logic (see my previous post), they just write queries for each table. We use DBT so every table is a \"model\", a glorified SELECT query with a bunch of configs. If you are interested you can probably create your weak version of DBT if your company doesn't use it.\n\n> how to manage the metadata of a table ( column names, types etc) that is tightly coupled to the code?\n\nEh, different teams treat it differently. Some teams use...Excel sheets. Some tools such as DBT addresses the issue. But whatever the tool is, it needs humans to feed in information. Automated tools exist too I think, but it's just a ticking bomb if humans don't check from time to time.",

        "body": "Here's some general suggestions:\n\n1: Care more about what your file/module look like than about whether you use classes in the right way or follow code patterns. Avoid large interconnected codebases, have clear interfaces and responsibility splits with other teams. Your main measure of maintainability should be whether you can easily transfer ownership of your code to another team with little context.\n\n2: Simple imperative code in pipelines is perfect for most usecases. Be explicit and avoid magic. [Push for loops down and ifs up](https://matklad.github.io/2023/11/15/push-ifs-up-and-fors-down.html) to make it at least possible to optimize code later and be very careful about functions that can't operate on batches. If you use streaming iterators, use your languages equivalent of chunked and call batch functions on chunks, don't call single element functions in an iterator.\n\n3: Understand the difference between struct of arrays and array of struct (aka row based vs column based), be aware of which of the two applies to the data formats you use and process things in their natural order. This combines nicely with chunking.\n\n4: If you use python, use ruff and uv, declare dependencies clearly in pyproject.toml, and use type hints on anything public. Prefer simple functions over classes, take protocol classes as input and spit out concrete data structures as output. Use asserts often, especially if something might need a comment.\n\n5: Make your data partitionable if possible. If you use a database, there should be a clear way to split it into (for example) ten smaller DBs with the same layout, and only need to copy small tables. Try to identify or create natural keys that are shared over the entire data pipeline that can be used to neatly split data without overlap. If you can't do this, you have most likely made things too complex and your data should probably be flattened.",

You can add a staging schema that is rebuilt every night, then a production schema that is promoted only when all tests pass. dbt has built-in tests like not null or unique, and you can write custom ones for your finance rules.\n\nAdd git branches and a pull-request rule. You open a branch, write or change a model, run dbt locally against a copy of the database, and push. The pull request triggers dbt in CI to run the models and tests on a temp schema. If every check passes you merge and Airflow picks up the new code next run. No more morning fire drills.\n\nSpend some of the budget on training or courses for Airflow, dbt, and basic CI with GitLab or GitHub Actions. These tools are free but learning them fast from tutorials is hard while you keep the day job running. After they are in place you will sleep better and your boss will see fresher numbers.",

        "body": "As a former finance guy turned data guy, here's what I would do if I was in that situation (trying to optimize for most efficient code changes knowing you don't have unlimited time/budget and you're new at all of this). \n\n\\- Try to break up the sql file into either separate business functions (from start to end) or break the whole thing into extract, transform, and load chunks, or combine the two. Once you do that I'd make sql files for each table and staging tables for each area, for instance maybe 500 lines of the sql query are used to bring in sales data, \n\nI'd create a staging\\_sales table that has only sales data that's populated from the 500 lines you grabbed from above. Do this for each different \"fact\" or \"dim\" table in your query so you have these much smaller sql files and  tables that you can query and check outputs before moving on. \n\n\\- Depending on how many joins you have with the source fact/dim tables from above, it might make sense to have staging tables for the outputs of certain joins from the tables you created earlier. Maybe your sales table has some really annoying exceptions logic and you need to double check that a lot, I'd make another table called staging\\_sales\\_w\\_exceptions or something so you can double check everything. Testing to make sure you broke up all the sql code up correctly will be a huge pain but 8000 lines of sql will do that. Pay extra attention to the joins and when something is being joined, those are usually the source of problems with stuff like this. \n\n\\- Ideally now you have a pretty good idea of how all the tables related to one another and you should understand how exactly table1 relates to table2, and split up the sql file into many smaller ones so you should have an idea of how changes in the source tables impact things downstream. Here's where dbt would come in handy, because you can run checks and rules on each part of the process to let you know what's happening (I think, we don't use it where I work but that's a selling point)\n\n\\- Since now you have a bunch of sql files and staging tables you'll probably want a place to put the sql files somewhere so they can stay organized and you know who made changes and when the changes were made. This is what github is for, you can make a repo that's private to store all your code there. Then you'll need something to run all this sql code in your DB, that's what Airflow/Prefect/Dagster/DBT are for. You connect your git repo to those services and they'll run your code for you one after another and you can setup your PBI to refresh right when the pipeline finishes running. Add in some data quality checks along the way and you'll be good. \n\n\\- You can also do all of that using stored procedures in the DB side, but I don't like doing that because tracking changes to the stored procs is more annoying.\n\n\\- I've found the closer you get to business logic the messier the code gets so no real advice there sadly",

Databricks (or Snowflake) compute size can be specifically tailored for each workload or run different types of workloads fully independently on the same database. Redshift workloads are constrained to all run in a single cluster environment if they need write access the same data. This remains true today despite the “data sharing” features that Redshift has added. Net-net if you run everything on Redshift then your workloads compete for resources and you have to very carefully control what runs when.",

Your Lambda just needs to make the query, then post the data to the firehose API.\n\nAn average of 1-2 requests per second isn't going to stress firehose.\n\nConfiguring firehose will let you choose how big you want your S3 write batches to be. You can make them more like every 15 minutes, or every 60 seconds. It is a tradeoff between object count and maximum latency to write to S3.\n\nIf you *need* to have the data in S3 within seconds, then Firehose isn't the tool for that. You would just be writing individual objects directly. I am struggling to think why you would need low latency S3 objects -- that's what Mongo would be for. S3 would generally be for your long term analytics or bulk data store, which is more latency tolerant.",

I think it will work well for infrastructure (databases, warehouses, potentially roles) but might not be the best tool for DDL.\n\nIt works, but it aint perfect, then again nothing is.

Small changes to supply chain or ingredients can have big implications on the environment (and communities). There is a big push internally for eco-labelling our products in the way ingredients are.\n\nThere are lots of data challenges when selling in ~200 countries with tens of thousands of products. Being able to estimate say, greenhouse gas emissions and life cycle assessment for a product portfolio right down to biodegradability of packaging types, or even how well recycling centres can detect plastics etc. isn’t easy. Tools like https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/ exist but they need very granular data right down to global sales.\n\nI’m more on the human safety side so don’t personally get all that close to it but PM me any questions if you think I can help. I bridge a lot of science areas but our sustainability and ecotox have by far the lowest tech skills, so there may not be that many jobs but someone with domain knowledge and even basic tech skills may be rare.

Some labs have pretty narrow research focuses, but most do work on more fields than you’d initially think, and likely have groups/divisions dedicated to what you’re interested in. \n\nThis is especially true for teams in the computational science sector, and having practical experience in data engineering and knowledge of the subject matter you’re into is very valuable. \n\nOn the upside: Pay tends to be a little better than other non-profits, though certainly less than industry. Also, while national labs are partially funded through and ultimately report back to DOE, most are actually run by contractors (Battelle being one of the big ones). This means that we’re usually treated similarly to government employees by everyone but the actual government, so we don’t (always) have to deal with the same BS federal employees are going through right now. This can also make it more straightforward to get access to certain data that wouldn’t otherwise be available. \n\nOn the downside: Most funds that come into the labs still come from other government offices like NIH, DOT, DOE, etc. So there is still susceptibility to political trade winds, especially for environmental stuff. Fortunately most research staff are pretty savvy at making subtle/small changes to existing projects to fly under the radar and appease their sponsors, as it were. \n\nAlso, in my experience (YMMV) labs tend to be insular, so it can be hard to get in, but it’s easier to move around (even between labs) once you’re in and making connections. My advice would be to make connections with staff whose research you’d be interested in assisting with. Some will be more open than others, but if they like you and need your skill set, they may be able to create a new DE position with you in mind, or at least point you to another group that might need you.\n\nETA: I ended up in renewable-adjacent work with a background in mechanical engineering and experience with machine learning. I’ve learned everything I know about DE on the job, and I’m not the only person I know who’s done that. I will also admit I knew someone (outside of research) at a lab who was able to pass my resume around more directly. So I mean it when I advise making connections with existing staff. It only got me to the interview stage, but sometimes that’s enough.",

What they do care about are data product features. If you can tie a use case where Redshift prevents the creation of data products, that is where you may be able to get traction. That can be challenging though since usually it less of a Redshift issue and are more of a coding, tuning, and data modeling issue.",

We have a data eng team <3 And 50-60 downstream users. Not every user is directly querying but we support a lot of SFDC, Hubspot, Zendesk, any SAAS platform some team decides to use. We cannot keep up proper optimization of every single one of these platforms tables by setting the correct split and dist key it's just unrealistic (yes they have an automated version now last I heard it was in private preview but I don't expect it to be good)\n\nDatabricks automatically handles via liquid clustering and automated vacuuming.\n\nBecause of this your price per compute usage is so much lower on Databricks (probably other platforms as well). The queries run much quicker on the same priced clusters.\n\n - Severless yes redshift has Redshift serverless and it's fucking dog shit and you're paying a lot. Because it's so bad you're effectively still tied to paying for compute + data, which scaled horrendously for us.\n\nOther platforms allow spinning up and down compute much simpler than Redshift does imo -> more savings.\n\n- Because of the simplified compute system you can separate jobs much more easily so resources aren't fighting with each other during a heavy dev dbt run or fivetran sync. You can do this in Redshift by modifying the WLM but it's just a bitch and you can still run into problems, it's very much a trial and error process.\n\n- If you're working with any JSON in redshift I'm sorry.\n\n- We had some governance problems that were helped via the transition, but I don't think the problem was redshift specific.\n\n- Not totally relevant but we also had some ML/GenAI jobs we were wanting to use Databricks for so doubled up our use case.\n\n- Federated queries make a migration insane easy.\n\nCaveat databricks really can be just as pricey as redshift serverless if you leave it to auto scale and aren't particular with your compute sizings. \n\nDownside: a lot of SAAS platforms support Redshift integrations but don't typically build out much more than Snowflake, BQ. Any datalake solution you kindve get fucked on here.",

Because they are paid more, you feel they must be more skilled than you. But they are not.\n\nTo go deeper: you feel that money and engineering skill are correlated. They are not. Money comes to people who can convince others of their own value; this is not a software engineering discipline, it is a marketing discipline. Very often, the worst engineers are the best-paid ones.\n\nOne more thing: You also feel that engineering is somehow better than marketing. It is not, they are different skills. Because you do not enjoy marketing, you convince yourself that you are a victim. You are not. You are simply unaware of realities, and that is not your fault. Your worldview is a product of an education system. That's all.\n\nFinally: You feel that skill is linked to success. It is not, because success does not exist. You cannot see it, feel it, or grasp it. When you try to find its essence, the essence eludes you. That's because it is completely fabricated; an unreal fiction. Free yourself from it, and focus on what makes you and those around you happy. Then, invest in those things. Your life is too short to spend it in a deluded state.",

This describes behavior that takes the same amount of time no matter how big the input gets. For example, accessing the first item in an array. It doesn’t matter how many elements are in the array, it always takes the same amount of time.\n\nO(n): linear time. This describes behavior that scales linearly as the input gets bigger. For example, printing each element in an array. As the input grows, so does the time.\n\nO(n²): quadratic time. This usually shows up when you have nested loops (a loop inside a loop) both running over the same input. For example, comparing every element in an array to every other element. The time it takes to complete a nested loop structure increases more and more as the input grows, even more than linearly.",

        "body": "People are often thrown into this class with only a vague notion of what a log in math is.  This is a bad starting point right off the bat.   Also, its VERY easy to get confused about WHAT YOU ARE COUNTING.  Bad books; you can't tell if they are counting the comparisons or the swaps in a sort algorithm.  Those numbers can be similar or very different.\n\nYou are in part telling me without telling me that you don't understand the NOTATION.  The concept aside, O(1) is notation for the simplest thing you can do: you do one operation (this can have several steps) and get the result.  Eg array\\[user\\_input\\] = 0;  you go there, you do something, you are done.  Sure, that is like 8 assembly instructions or something, but big-O is a conceptual level thing, not a detail level thing.  You wanted to know how many assignments, you did 1.\n\nO(N) is similar.  you iterate an array and add 5 to each element.  How many times did you add 5?  Well, you did it for whatever the size of the array is, but we didn't say...  that is abstracted to the letter \"N' which just means \"some amount of them\".   You write that one O(N), see how that works?\n\nlooping over every element with nested loops is a multiply.. for(1-n){for (1-n again)} .. how many times does the inner part happen?  Its N\\^2 .. the outer loop does n inner loops for 1, n inner loops for 2, ...  right?  And that is unsurprisingly written O(N\\^2).\n\nSo the notation is O (some expression of N).   some expression of N could be almost anything you might see in math, from N! to log(N) to N\\^3 to sqrt(N) or whatnot.  Big-O only keeps the dominant terms (eg 3n\\^3 + 11n\\^2 + 37) is just written O(n\\^3) ..  because in the big picture, the cubed term will soon dwarf the others and give you a general sense of how slow it will be.\n\n\\-------------------\n\na log is just an exponent, with its own math notation that is weird and a bunch of cool properties that you are told to memorize without being led to connect the dots, the first time you see them, and many people never get much past that part.   I mean, its stuff you know, though, if you can just see past the notation and look at the numbers.  0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 ... you know these guys ... its the powers of 2.  How many times, using only integers, can you cut the number 100 in half?  Even rounding it up..  50 (once), 25(twice) 13(three times), 7(4), 4(5),2(6),1(7) and done.   Hmm.  2\\^7 is... 128.  Hmm.  See the connection?  The math problem is \"to what integer power do I raise 2 to get 100\".  The answer is 6 or 7 depending on if you want to over shoot or under shoot the target.   THAT IS A LOG problem, and its all you are going to see in big-O is powers of 2.  No base 17 logs or e or anything from math that gets weird, just powers of 2, and that is the question it is asking and the answer.  Its not that scary, when you see it written out, hopefully?  All the log algorithms are about cutting the data in half over and over, just like that, for example think about how you search a physical book dictionary for a word: you open in the middle, and its more towards A or more towards Z, so you cut the half where it will be in half again...  is it more towards M or Z... more towards M or S ... whatever... (and yea humans jump to the first letter section better than by halfs but play along with the blind approach ... this is just what a binary search does ...  cuts the list in half until its down to 1 element and its found or not at that point). \n\nThat is about 85% of the big o stuff.  There will be other notations at the same time  that denote best case, average case, worst case and so on that you just need to memorize (the notation, I mean, memorize THAT) and rules (like the dropping of constants and taking the dominating term of the equation that your code defines.\n\nthere are not that many REAL in use big-O answers.  There is 1, lg(n), N\\*lg(n), N, N\\^powers, and the ugly stuff like N! or 2\\^N etc.  And practical algorithms rarely go abouve N\\^3 before someone gets mad and finds a better way (there are some things where there is no better way, but MOST stuff you see day in and day out has an answer N\\^3 or better).  I mean there are screwballs... shellsort for example often ends up with some form of O(N\\^(x+1/x))  eg N\\^7/6 was a common find back when I studied that algorithm.  But shell sort needs a freakin PHD level analysis to find the complexity for many of the sequences and its not handed out lightly to students.  You won't see that kind of mess most likely, or if you do, they will just give you the answer and tell you (indirectly) that it was a pain to figure that out.",

        "body": "Big-O notation is a fancy term for approximation. Basically you count the number of operations that your code performs.\n\nFor example, the very first LeetCode problem: given a list of integers, find a pair of integers that sum up to a given target. An example of non-optimal solution:\n\n    def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):\n                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:\n                    return [i, j]\n\nIt has a loop with n iterations (i index) and inside each iteration is another loop with n iterations (j index). So the code may evaluate the if statement up to n \\* n times, hence O(n\\*\\*2) time complexity.\n\nAn optimal solution:\n\n    def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n        prev_numbers = {}\n    \n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n            complement = target - num\n            if complement in prev_numbers:\n                return [prev_numbers[complement], i]\n            prev_numbers[num] = i\n\nIt has only a loop with n iterations. The code may evaluate the if statement up to n times max, hence O(n) complexity.\n\nAnother common introduction to the notation is a binary search. In a binary search you halve the length of the list at each iteration. How many times you divide the length of the list (n) until it becomes 1? Roughly log(n) / log(2). Hence O(log(n)) complexity for binary search.\n\nLook up multiple tutorials and introductions and build your own understanding of the subject. Don't just rely on a single course or tutorial.",

Because they can't read and understand code well enough to make any conclusions on how many times some code might loop or the like.\n\nLike, look at some pseudo code like:\n\n    function maxproduct(List l): int\n    {\n        int maxproduct, i, j = 0,0,0\n        while (i < l.length)\n        {\n            while ( i + j < l.length)\n            {\n               int product = l[i] * l[i+j]\n               if (product > maxproduct) maxproduct = product\n               j++\n            }\n            i++\n        }\n        return maxproduct\n    }\n\nIf the list contains 1 item, how many times will the \"`int product = l[i] * l[i+j`\\]\" line be executed? What if it contains 10 items? 100?\n\nIf you can look at the code and figure that type of thing out pretty quickly, then figuring out Big O becomes a lot easier to understand - you're really just talking about the relationship between the number of inputs and how many instructions and how one grows as the other grows.\n\nBut if you *can't* look at a code block like that pretty quickly and tell me roughly how many times the interior loop will run based on the length of the list, your problem isn't really understanding Big O notation. It is that your programming knowledge isn't advanced enough to really be able to grasp it. So if that's the case, I'd put worrying about Big O aside and instead return to focusing on the basics of reading and writing simple code until you really get it and can read it easily before returning to more theoretical concepts like Big O.",

It's a hard way to learn, but at the end, you'll know it.\n\nIn many cases, there wasn't even a book.  You want to learn how this library works?  Well, here's the header files and the source code, go nuts.  It surprises younger people I work with a lot when I basically say, let's skip the docs and just look at the source for this function.  But, the docs can be wrong, the source code can't.\n\nI honestly can't imagine learning from a youtube video or something and I am a \\*little\\* skeptical that really works, but people are doing it, so I guess it does, for some people",

Even university level courses. The reason for that is, that they leave out a lot of information. This then results in the viewer beeing left with a lot of holes in their knowledge that they aren't even aware of and will therefore likely never be filled. These holes then become a problem during their entire learning process.\n- Imo, if you're learning about a topic, you should learn about it in it's entirety. Books and official documentation are the best for that.\n- Also, most (modern) documentations (if you go to their actual websites) are very beginner friendly, offering tutorials and even (practice) projects.\n\nSo, to sum it up. Online courses/videos are in my opinion to basic and don't cover topics deeply enough. This results in flawed or missing knowledge. Therefore, I recommend books or official documentations.",

In my opinion, the three main things are the following:\n\n* Connect with people in the field. Reach out to them. Ask questions. But most importantly, bring something to the table. Share what you’re working on or what you’ve learned.\n* Set learning objectives, always with a clear goal in mind. What do you want to achieve? Learning just for the sake of it can be a huge mistake.\n* Explore training programs or curriculums that interest you. Even if you don’t enroll, look into what they cover. Are you sure you have all the necessary background? One of the biggest challenges for self-learners is dealing with knowledge gaps.\n\nThe ability to self-learn is, in my opinion, one of the strongest signs of both soft and hard skills. **Don’t doubt your abilities** mate, keep pushing and show the world what you can do. Best of luck :)",

Website support is one of them. \n\nWith your skills, you can do some webmaster work. At this point you’re just a glorified artist. What you lack is database knowledge. :) \n\nI would recommend picking up some cloud certifications too. \nThis will enable you to ensure that a website or a network resource is operating in addition to maintaining the page itself, and making sure it looks good. \n\nYou’ll pick up additional skills and make friends at an MSP. Within a year or two, you can apply for analyst work. And once you land your first analyst role, the gates are open to pretty much anywhere you want. \n\nTo be most rounded, I would recommend learning a little bit of shell (zsh, bash, batch, PS). Because being familiar with a shell is helpful no matter what your IT role is. \n\nYou can make a lot of useful custom tools for yourself with the shell. \nFor instance, in my role on a fairly regular basis I’ll find myself migrating large amounts of data. So I’ve modified my .bashrc to alias the “cp” command to basically be an “rsync” command with arguments to show progress and ensure file integrity.\nIn the .bash_aliases file I’ve alias’d “ll” to be “ls -la” with a couple commands to “df” and “du”, to show me all files, hidden files, attributes, the device that the current working directory is on, and the total amount of disk space that current working directory is using. \n\nDifferent little things that help keep important information at my fingertips without needing to always remember complex, unintuitive syntax and arguments. \n\nI’ve made wrappers for system functions like tshark and udisksctl… anything that makes my job easier. \nThat’s what’s super important about shell. You can use it to create whatever tools you need to make your life easier. \n\nYou can make tools with any language really. But knowing how to do with a shell is very helpful because you won’t need to download or grab dependencies for some specific language.",

Since then, a lot of people have realized that good old relational databases aren't that bad actually.\n\nFor your projects consider this:\n\n* ACID vs. eventual consistency\n* Strict schema vs. schemaless design\n* Decent/good scalability vs. (almost) unlimitted scalability\n\nEach of these is a trade-off that has consequences for the code you write. You need to research/evaluate these trade-offs and decide, which side your projects want to be on.\n\nTraditional databases are on the left side and provide a lot of \"safety\" and strict reliability for clean data.\n\nNoSQL databases typically fall on the right side. They sacrifice a lot of \"guarantees\" for scalability. If you choose one of these you have to consider issues that might occur from \"eventual consistency\" and not being able to really rely on the data structure returned by your database.\n\nRelational databases offer quite flexible queriing. Need to now which `Product`s a `Customer` has added to their shopping basket? SQL can query that! Later, need to now which `Customer`s have bought a certain `Product` (reverse)? That's just another SQL query! You don't have to change your database structure to support that.\n\nNoSQL often are not that flexible. If you structure your database to efficiently support the first query, it won't be as efficient to support the second query. Worst case, you'll have to completely restructure your DB to support the use case.\n\nParadoxically, NoSQL makes it very simple to store/retrieve an object structure, without much upfront-thinking about how your data looks like. But as soon as you do more complex queries you need to know **exactly** how you're going to access your data.",

So you must be EXTRA careful when you change the schema of your database.   \n  \nWe abide by the following rules :  \n\\* A collection only holds one type of document  \n\\* If we add a field to a document, we must add it to every existing object in the database  \n\\* If there's a relationship, materialize it with a foreign key ( basically, \\_id)\n\nJust following those 3 rules got us really far with a very homogenous and reliable DB, so much that we are transitioning to supporting both SQL and no-SQL - we want to offer an on-premise version of our app, hence using the customer's favorite DB.   \n  \nThe transition is proving to be pretty much trivial so far - thanks to our rules and us using abstraction ( i.e. LinQ in C# mostly), which makes our query translate 1-1 in others DBMS.\n\nBut really, the cluster capabilities of Mongo is the key point in our choice.",

No, a player isn't an enemy, wtf were you thinking? You already had a common base class, use that. Besides, an \"enemy\" isn't even a class in itself, nor should player be. They are just specific characters used for specific purposes. You're trying to inherit roles or behaviour, which is bad. Create one character class that supports \"can be controlled\", then player is just an instance that's controlled with mouse/keyboard while enemies are instances that are controlled automatically.\n\nSame thing with your archer/mage example. Being an archer is a playstyle, a role, or a behavior. It's still a character, use composition to indicate its roles and/or weapons that it uses. One useful tip is to think of \"can this change at runtime?\" If the answer is yes then use composition. Can a character become a building in the middle of the game? Uh, no. Can an enemy become an ally? Yes, people change their mind => use composition.\n\nAlso I have no idea what your issue with the Button is. Yes, use composition. Is checkbox something you can press?

You *should* of course think about the relationships between different objects, and you *should* prefer interfaces/protocols and containment over inheritance. But at the end of the day, what you really need to do is to be willing to aggressively refactor as needed. And that has little to do with OOP specifically... you're bound to make some mistakes as you write code in any paradigm, and you have to be willing to reconsider past decisions and change course.\n\n>Your object can't be two things at one.\n\nOf course it can. That's practically the definition of *polymorphism* \\-- \"many forms.\"\n\n>Let's say you have fighters, archers and mages in your game - three classes. At some point, you want the player to be both an archer and a mage. How do you do that without complex or ugly workarounds like creating another class named FighterAndMage ?\n\nWell, you *don't* do it with an inheritance graph like Object->Character->Player->\\[Fighter|Mage|Archer\\]. Instead, you could give the class that represents a player an attribute, like \\`role\\` and a corresponding \\`Role\\` type that sets the expectations for what a Role is. Fighter, Mage, and Archer *could* be derived from Role, or they could just be instances of Role -- i.e. all exactly the same type of object, but with different data. For example, it might be that any role can hit an adversary, and any role can cast spells, but a Fighter might just hit harder, and a Mage might have a higher probability of success with magic. If a player can have more than one role at a time, then the \\`role\\` attribute should really be \\`roles\\` and refer to some kind of collection or combination of the roles.\n\n>Encapsulation is a useful trait for OOP to make code more secure but getts and setters can add a lot of boilerplate.\n\nThat depends on the language. For example, in Swift you don't have to write any accessors -- you just use whatever attributes an object has. But there are implicit accessors there, and if you later want to modify them you can do so at any time.\n\n>With ECS you have a relation of \"IT HAS\" instead of \"IT IS\".\n\nWith OOP you have both types of relationships. Your concern about careful planning of the inheritance graph suggests that you've been prioritizing \"it is\" over \"it has\" when in fact you should usually do the opposite.",

It works when your domain is more or less fixed, and you can draft the entire type hierarchy from the start. But if there's enough uncertainty and you need to add new types to the domain over time it's just too hard to get right. This is where something like an ECS shines because it's designed to give you maximum flexibility when defining types and assigning properties to them.\n\nI also don't think that DOD necessarily conflicts with OOP. DOD just tells you to design your classes around the data and how it's mutated instead of modeling your domain in code.",

Deep inheritance chains were very much a '90s or early '00s thing, and I think we've all seen the issues with them.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to think of OOP in terms of messages - Alan Kay (the guy who kinda invented the term) said he should have called it \"message oriented programming\", not object-oriented.  Joe Armstrong, the inventory of Erlang (a functional/actor language) once said that he thought Kay would disagree, but he considered Erlang more \"object-oriented\" than almost any other language, and Kay agreed.\n\nNow, that's a bit of a minority opinion, but it just goes to show how widely the definition of \"OOP\" can vary.\n\nIOW, I think your view of OOP is frankly very incomplete.

Famous computer scientist Donald Knuth once said \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\", meaning basically that we should worry about correctness and simplicity first, otherwise we will end up wasting all our time/shooting ourselves in the foot.\n\n2. The correct approach is to first have a working program/code/feature, and then assess whether the performance even is problematic, and then if it is, use profiling or instrumentation to see which part of the code is slow and why. Then, focus on optimizing only that part of the code.\n\n3. In order to understand why code is slow, you can look at it from an algorithmic standpoint, like for instance noticing a double for loop, meaning a potential N\\^2 algorithm, which could maybe be redone in some clever way to become O(N) or NlogN, OR you can look at it from a systems standpoint, for instance you are only using 1 thread/1 cpu core but your machine as 128 cores available, or you should be doing CPU work and IO at the same time, etc. to maximize utilization of the resources.\n\n4. I don't really think it's realistic to be able to write thing fast and efficient \"in the first draft\" as you say, it sort of goes against everything else I wrote here. That being said, depending on what kind of code you are writing, if you have a general understanding of basic algorithms like sorting and searching and so on, along with time complexity, maybe you can build some muscle for doing this just at a basic level. But I would not encourage you to try to optimize things at the system level in the first draft because usually it's more trouble than it's worth.",

Use that judgement to trend toward low complexity, so that if/when you get to an optimization pass the basics are already sane. \n\n2. Pay close to attention to your intended throughput. Think about how fast this needs to go and how often and how much data it's working on so that you're aware of how much you need to be thinking about #1.

C helps you understand low-level concepts much better, so by the time you transition to C++, it becomes easier to grasp the more advanced, high-level features.\n\nThat said, I’ve also seen people start directly with C++ as their first language and do just fine. C++ still covers low-level concepts like pointers and dynamic memory allocation, but it also introduces you to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and modern design patterns early on. So, both paths can work depending on your goals and learning style\n\nbut since you've mentioned that you're studying software engineering, I'd say C then C++ because that wouldn't harm you more than brings you more knowledge in your field",

To take a house-building analogy, sometimes you're just the brick layer.  Sometimes you're just assembling pre-fab kits.  Sometimes you're the lead architect who does the design (UX) but also the main drawings and materials selection.  Sometimes you're the consulting engineer who does the stress analysis.\n\nNo, most programmers don't need to know much math, unless the programs you're writing *DO* math.  And even then, usually they'll pair you with a mathematician.  In the same way that the people who make medical software don't know surgery, and the people who make flight software don't fly planes.\n\nThere are times when you have to be ***BOTH*** a domain expert and a programmer.  But, often, in those cases, one or the other suffers.  Trust me; I know guys who work at Lockheed Martin who are one but not the other, and sometimes people who aren't either.  And these are the people making weapons systems designed to kill people.\n\nTL;DR - most programming does not require domain knowledge.  And, the domain is rarely doing math--or even applied math.  And when it does, it's better to work with someone who **IS** a domain expert, and learn to communicate and collaborate.\n\nThere are *MAYBE* a handful of jobs that you'll be given as a new programmer that will involve math.

Only the server application has access to the database.\n\nIf your client application has a login process normally you store a password in the database as a hash (SHA128/256/512/1024) of a salt (random data) and the password. The salt and hash is stored in the database.  When someone provides their password it is sent to the server which then grabs the salt, hashes it and the password and makes sure the result matches the hash in the database.\n\nThe salt is to ensure someone can't calculate hashes of common passwords ahead of time and just scan your database for those hash results.  The hash ensures nobody can see the user's password in the database nor can the reverse the hash to find the user's password.\n\nThe salt needs to be random/different between users as well, you don't want two people with the same password having the same hash in the database.",

Go with python. \n\nKeep in mind that once you have learned the general principles of programming (i.e learn to think like a programmer), learning a new language is very easy, because basically the only thing that changes is the syntax, and some quirks that each language may have, but the core concepts are always the same. \n\nPython is a good generic starting language to learn programming concepts because its syntax is not complex, and it has libraries for everything you might want to do. \n\nAs for resources, I would suggest first using youtube tutorials/books to learn about different concepts (variables, operators, functions, classes, etc.), then figuring out what the best language is for your use case, and trying to solve leetcode challenges. Leetcode is a very good resource to teach you algorithmic thinking and program optimization. \n\nAnother alternative for when you get decent is to choose an open-source project that you like from github and try to contribute to it, in order to learn about integration and work with real-world systems.

It's your brain literally rewiring itself to think logically. \n\nDon't give up yet. Give it at least 2-3 weeks of consistent practice before you decide anything. Python usually clicks around week 3-4 for most people, but everyone's different.\n\nAbout whether you should continue, programming skills are pretty valuable right now, especially with AI stuff happening. Even if you don't become a full time developer, knowing how to code helps in almost any field.\n\nAs for next language, worry about that later. Get comfortable with Python first. Maybe after 6 months you can think about JavaScript or something else.\n\nYou're not wasting time, just being realistic about the learning curve. Stick with it for at least a month before making any big decisions :)",

What you need to do is learn to write a function that takes inputs, aka parameters. The basic idea is that you write the code once using the functions parameters, and then you can call the function any number of times with whatever values you want. You can use parameters for anything that you want to be adjustable in the function. If you write a function that draws an enemy, you can use parameters to specify the location of the enemy, but also what color(s) to use, how many legs or teeth the enemy has, and anything else that could change from one enemy to the next.\n\nOnce you’ve got a function that draws the enemy, you can create a list of sets of parameters. Then, you can use a loop to iterate over the list and call the `enemy` function with each set of parameters, and the function will draw all the enemies in the list one at a time.\n\nThis is one of the fundamental ideas in programming. Computers work largely by repeating simple sets of instructions, very very quickly, with different data.",

You don't have to do one thing, you can grow into different things. \n\nSo, think about it. Which one do you like the most now and which one would you like to do in the future?",

Those help, and certainly when you're flooded with applicants you can throw resumes in the trash that don't have the technologies you're looking for, but that's an early filter. (which technologies get you past those early filters? that is location dependent as you've already intuited - the only way to know for you area is to check local job boards)\n\nAnother early filter is \"do they have a 4 year degree in CS?\" You don't *need* one but, again, if a company is flooded with applicants you can toss all the resumes without a 4 year degree in the trash and still have plenty of choice. If you don't, you're going to need some networking (as in leveraging and building your network of personal contacts, not TCP/IP!) skills, so work on building those up.\n\nBut the really important things are - can you *think for yourself?* Can you *solve problems?* A lot of young programmers have never really solved problems by themselves, they've either just been following tutorials or, worse, using AI for everything. Once you get past the HR filters, getting through the interview is going to be show that you've got the interpersonal skills every job needs (can you take direction? work as a team? self-motivate?), and then your problem solving and thinking skills.\n\nNot every interview is going to have a \"whiteboard coding\" problem, but all of them are going to try to do something to capture how much skill you have versus just how much you've memorized.",

Recruiter in the tech space (building a tech talent community to upskill + place talent) here, and I work with a lot of junior devs trying to break into the job market.   \n  \nEntry levels are really competitive because of a combination of a couple things: 1) AI is replacing a lot of aspects of a junior role, 2) as a result of the AI influence, companies seemingly want more specialists vs generalists in the market rn (this is my opinion though from speaking with companies and seeing their sentiment), and 3) in general, less companies are looking to spend the time mentoring + training junior talent when they know they can use AI for a certain amount of tasks + hire intermediate/senior talent to come in and hit the ground running right away.\n\nWhat I'd recommend: build your projects and experience in a way that shows your adaptability to pick up new technologies/skills as fast as possible. Show that your insight, productivity, and understanding of how to solve a problem is there, something that AI cannot show! \n\nSome things you can do: build an awesome portfolio website to showcase your projects and present them in a case study like format (showcase your thinking and process), align your resume to the very specific skillset that the company is looking for and if you have some dream roles/companies, building projects very specifically towards that, and most importantly: build up your network. Reach out to people on LinkedIn/reddit/conferences/forums etc and build connections to learn and connect with them. You never know where a connection can lead to - I've had people that I met 6 years ago offer me a great job when I needed it most! \n\nAnd finally, as I always do, you can always check out our talent community where we help you upskill on exactly this and find directly recruited jobs for you (but ofc, you're welcome to apply outside of our community too). If you're interested, here's our website: [https://acetalent.io/join-like-a-monad](https://acetalent.io/join-like-a-monad)\n\nI hope this helps & feel free to ask any more questions!",

Perhaps ask your internship contact whether something like that is likely to be possible. That's what happened to me: I was tasked with just data entry, but I saw the need for an extensive database of all companies in the NYC tri-state area for the data entry personnel, so I purchased a then CD-ROM -based business directory with appropriate data, wrote a custom utility in C++ to convert over a million records into a flat-file database format used by the company, converted all the data on my home PC and handed that huge chunk of data to my boss. He was very impressed and even gave me a monetary bonus.",

Switching to macOS helped me with moving closer to Linux, but grabbing a cheap laptop from Facebook marketplace and installing a dozen different Linux distros will get you further and faster. I suggest using a separate machine so you can go scorched earth.\n\n**No** because you should stick with whatever you're comfortable moving forward with. People may give up over the tiniest things. DO NOT accidentally kill your interest in programming by changing your environment so much that you lose faith in your foundations.\n\n  \nEdit: Forgot to mention that WSL is pretty good right now. When I'm forced to suffer through Windows I tend to use Git Bash for simple operations and WSL for anything that Git Bash can't handle. These days Git Bash for windows has the option to install a bunch of command-line tools that make life on Windows a bit more linux-like. Can't live without it.",

        "body": "You need to start managing this project by capturing the business requirements and tracking how long it takes you to deliver them.\n\nThe temptation is to just work on features as quickly as you can, to the best of your ability, and try to hit the deadlines set by your manager.  *Don't do this: it's a recipe for burn-out and failure*.\n\nInstead, you need to plan your work up front, calculate how long it will take, and manage the business's expectations accordingly.  You're a junior, and your working alone, so you need to give yourself time to do the necessary research and to correct the inevitable mistakes you'll make along the way.\n\nBusinesses like *certainty*.  They are less concerned with *how long* things take; they want to know *when* they will be ready so that they can plan accordingly.  Your job is to give yourself enough time to deliver your work to an acceptable standard, to tell your manager *when* things will be complete, and to warn your manager *when* they will be late *as soon as you are able to*.\n\nBelow is an outline of how to do this effectively: \n\nYou have some high-level requirements already.  Break those requirements down into units of work that deliver business value.  We'll call those units features.  The features need to be as small as they can be, such that completing one delivers some value to the business, even if it isn't usable in isolation.\n\nAs an example, imagine you need to implement user accounts so that people can log onto the system and use it.  The complete set of features that make a complete working implementation might be the following:\n\n- Registration\n- Login\n- Reset password\n- Update credentials\n\nAll of these can be delivered as separate features.  Even though registration is useless without login (and vice versa), they can be developed independently and each add business value independent of the other, so they count as separate features.\n\nThe reason we try to make features small in this way is that it makes them closer to each other in size; therefore the time it takes to complete any of them will be of a similar magnitude.  This will be important later.\n\nOnce you have a collection of such features, you can begin working on them.  As you work on them, you want to set aside some time in your week to plan the next set of requirements while you deliver the first.\n\nIt's up to you to find the right balance between planning and delivery.  Basically you want to be delivering as much as possible, but doing enough planning that you always have something in the backlog to work on.  You want to make sure you capture all the requirements in the planning phase.\n\nYou should have a nice predictable cadence to your work.  You begin a task and you work on it until it is done.  If you have to stop half way through a task because you failed to capture a business requirement, or failed to predict a technical problem, this is an indication that you didn't do enough prep work.  We call these issues *blockers*.  They happen to everyone - even experienced devs - but they will become rare if you are able to identify and fix their cause.\n\nYou should keep a record of the features you're working on somewhere.  It could be a Trello board, a GitHub project, a spreadsheet, a list in your diary, post-it notes - it doesn't matter where it lives.  What matters is that you move features from the backlog to *in-progress* while you're working on them, and then into *done*, when you complete them; *and crucially*, you need to record *when* you completed them.  Tools like Trello do this automatically for you.\n\nOnce you have completed some features, you will have some real knowledge of how long it takes to complete a feature.  Let's say you complete 5 features over a 2 week period.  That means you have a velocity of *2 days per feature*.  *Now* you can predict how long it will take you to complete the remaining features.  As you complete more features, your velocity will become more accurate.  Maybe by the end of the month, it turns out that it takes 2.5 days to complete a feature.  Feed that back into your predictions.\n\nIf you break your features down into small units of business value, like I outlined above, you will reduce the margin of error in the prediction.  Realistically, some features will be completed sooner than others, but it all averages out over time.\n\nYou can also use your velocity to make long-term predictions.  If you count the average number of features that make up a high-level requirement (let's call it an \"epic\") then you can get a rough estimate of how long it will take to deliver an epic.\n\nDon't *guess* how long a feature will take to complete.  You'll just get it wrong, but you'll still be obligated to achieve the deadline you set for yourself just the same.  Use the velocity to *predict* how long it will take to complete your features, and keep updating that velocity.  It's a good idea to put a couple of days on the end of the prediction in any case, to give yourself some wiggle room if anything goes wrong.\n\nInitially, you won't have a velocity.  Tell your manager that you'll give him an estimate just as soon as you've completed a few features.  If he really needs an estimate now, give him your best estimate, but update it as soon as you have a velocity, and update it again every time that velocity changes.\n\nSometimes businesses actually do have deadlines they need to meet.  Once you're tracking your progress effectively, you have the means to tell your manager if those deadlines are realistic.  If you can see that you aren't going to deliver all the features required for a deadline, you and your manager need to negotiate what you're going to do about it.  You're likely to have one of 5 options:\n\n1. Move the deadline;\n2. Remove features;\n3. Hire another developer;\n4. Work overtime;\n5. Cut some corners.\n\n4 and 5 are real options, but they are riskier, and they need to be managed carefully.  If you're going to work overtime, you ought to be getting paid overtime, and you'll also need to take a holiday afterwards to recover your energy.  There is also the issue of whether or not you *want* to be the one making all the sacrifices, and whether or not your company is taking advantage of you.\n\nIf you're going to cut corners, you need to fix-up your work as soon after the deadline as possible.  Time needs to be set aside for this and future deadlines may need to be delayed.  This is called *paying back your technical debt* and failing to do so can ultimately sink a project.\n\nAlong with features, you're also going to have to perform other tasks, such as bug fixes, refactors, meetings, and so on.  You only need to track product facing tasks (i.e. features and bugs), but you can track other things as well if it helps you organise and manage your workload.\n\nBugs are an important dimension to measure.  Together with velocity, they give you a real measure of the success of your project, and some actual quantitative data to share with you manager. (Managers love data.)\n\nYou can track bugs on the same board, but track them separately, and *don't include them in the velocity*; that's for features only.  More bugs will usually coincide with a reduction in velocity, and both trends mean that you need to fix some underlying issue with your code.  Maybe it needs refactoring, better linting, or more unit tests.  Maybe it's outgrown its architecture.  They're an indication that you're either delivering too quickly and neglecting the quality of your code, or have some limitation in your architecture that you need to overcome.\n\nYou need to pay attention to what is causing these issues because it will help you inform decision you make about the project going forward.  E.g. have you finally outgrown those Google Sheets?  Or, are you spending enough time keeping your code tidy.\n\nAgain, all of this is intended to help you make room for yourself to improve the parts of your project your manager won't see and ultimately doesn't care about unless they produce a failure (which they will if they go unchecked) while providing the velocity that shows predictable progress.  You need to give yourself room to try unit testing, or some library that you need, or whatever it is you think the project needs.\n\nDon't hide these kinds of data for fear of being criticised.  You can use them to demonstrate why you need the things that you know you need.",

First, you need to learn the \"alphabet\" of programming such as variables, loops, functions, algorithms and other basic concepts that are applicable to any programming language. Then you need to learn idioms for the programming language of choice, e.g., object-oriented programming for C++ or trait-oriented programming for Rust, as well as the standard library for that programming language with basic string operations and so on. Then, finally, you need to learn the chosen problem domain, such as blockchain API and smart contract API.\n\nThat's a lot of material and that's why a proper Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science takes 4 years. I rarely see a programmer who writes maintainable, usable code with less than 2 - 3 years of experience. Five years of experience is the minimum to be able to build serious, larger systems without constant supervision.\n\nMy advice: don't waste too much time on passive, video-based courses. If you want to get good at something, learn by doing. Learn a topic and start solving specific exercises for that topic using a specific programming language, hands-on.",

If you know what concept you need to apply to get some problem solved, you can always look up the syntax how to do so.\n\nFor example; \nYou want to parse json data from the API\n\nYou would need to use \"encoding/json\" for converting that json data to a \"programmable format\" called parsing. To do that you need to know concepts like parsing, json unmarshalling/marshalling, learning what even API means etc. \n\nYou don't need a deep understanding of these concepts first and I think they can be learned by doing projects and then asking chatGPT or fellow humans for assistance when you hit a roadblock or need further explanation. When you do project based learning you will encounter many points, in which you have to dive deep into the inner workings of a computer to get past something or after you are done building for the day, you can further your understanding on some new concepts that you encountered/applied. \n\nBasics can be drilled by practicing for loops, if statements, variable declarations, playing around with data structures like looping over them, learning some basic searching and sorting algorithms and then diving deeper into paradigms and how to identify some of the key patterns found in some of the problems.",

Now, if you were to be targeting only a single platform like Linux desktop then yeah Qt is probably fine. If it were me though I'd still rather try and get Java to run on whatever device you're using and use Javafx for gui before doing Qt again.",

I do embedded design and development and the framework has everything I need for fast graphics, rapid development, and localization support with good tools for translators. \n\nI have a product on Qt 5.15 which has 19 patch releases and is very stable, and am starting a Qt 6 product. I don’t trust any other framework as much. The Qt framework has 30 years in the market as a native speed, C++ solution… 15 years of QML in the market, and it’s in in cars and medical devices. There’s a million developers today. That’s less than half the number of Flutter developers right now, but Flutter is too new for me to trust.\n\nThe next product I’m working on will be on an LTS Qt 6 release. I researched the options and Qt came out on top for our team.\n\nBTW, if you are making a medical device, it is possible to get a perpetual license, but you must request it. The perpetual license only has 1 year of upgrades, maybe 4 patch releases, but you can modify the source code and fix GUI defects forever. Get at least one perpetual license and enough 3-year subscription licenses to complete the development phase, then get a 1- year upgrade for the perpetual license before going to 510k so you pick up the latest patch release versions. With the perpetual license, you will be locked to the highest versions available when the 1-year expires, but you can always  get another 1-year upgrade for the perpetual license to pick up later patch releases or newer versions for future products.",

If it is difficult to upgrade software, use a mature LTS release and stick with it.\n\nIf you have an upgrade plan that allows updates to products in the field, go with the most modern LTS that will be available when the product enters testing.\n\nQt 6.8 is the latest LTS release and has a number of features I want, particularly incremental garbage collection. \n\nQt 6.12 will be the next LTS, releasing around September 2026. It should have an accelerated, C++ 2D drawing system similar to QNanoPainter of all goes well. \n\nIf starting a product that will start testing after Qt 6.12 is available, I would start with Qt 6.9 now and upgrade as newer versions release.

How do you find the ease of maintaining your product in Qt after a new major version release (e.g., going from Qt 5 to Qt 6)? Do you generally migrate your existing products to newer major versions, or do you tend to stick with the LTS version you started with? And if you don't migrate, is licensing often the main reason, or are there other significant challenges involved?",

I'm serious - STEM stuff tends to be constantly evolving so it really is up to us to keep our skills sharp and keep sharpening them further. \n\nFor example, my first job after graduation with my automation engineering degree was as an electrical technician in a factory. I knew the very basics of C++, a reasonable amount of PLC ladder logic, and how electricity worked to an extent. It was like being thrown in the deep end. Nearly every time I fixed something I was learning on the job because I'd never done it before. It really developed my mindset and got me to be an expert at not knowing everything but knowing exactly how to find the information I did need. I didn't know my ass from my elbows at the start but you bet I got really good at stuff I didn't even learn in school like vision software and how to program a laser welder. \n\nNow I'm back in school for data science. I have done a *ton* of independent study because I hit my stride after we did a hexapawn project at the end of my data structures intro course where the prof gave extra credit if you did it using machine learning. Turns out I really enjoy machine learning, and coupled with my other interests in finance and stuff I've been collecting textbooks just to continue broadening what I'm able to do. Like, today I spent a few hours coding a tool that would be useful to me. That's a super great way to hone your skills. It was also in a language I barely know(Pinescript). Even published the source code because while the features I want to add are incomplete the base function does work. \n\nYou might also consider leetcode and quant questions to challenge you. Tutorial hell is a bastard and I find myself terribly bored if I'm not actually working at something. \n\nI hope this helps.",

As I'm coming to towards my end, here's my advice to you: Spend as much of your free time as you can developing software with AI tools. \n\nGet Aider or Cline or Roo or Cursor and become an expert at writing code with these tools. Because it's not the same as writing code the old fashioned way and it's not as simple as a lot of people like to think it is. It takes a real investment of time to develop expertise to be able to use LLMs really effectively. People who have that expertise are going to be the ones who are in demand.\n\nI've been doing this for a long time and the moment I used chat GPT, I saw the future and I don't think a day has gone by that I haven't used an LLM since then. I work for a high-end tech consulting firm. We just wrapped up on what was our first truly AI-enabled team/project. Everyone on the team had a lot of experience using LLMs and we ha Cline and Gemini 2.5 Pro, and we just absolutely crushed our deliverables. We spent the second half of the engagement adding all sorts of wish list features because we'd gotten the requirements done in half the estimated time. \n\nThis is the future, or at the very least, the near future, of software development. I\n\nf I have any advice after a career of this, it's: Keep up! If you don't really enjoy it, you're not going to keep up and it's going to make you miserable. This field changes so fast and if you don't keep up, you're going to miss the important technologies and before you know it, you're years behind your peers.",

Then do something similar for your own needs, or customize one of the examples there to add features to it or to make it more to your tastes.\n\nI recently had an issue where I wanted to put some music (e.g. 50 files) on a cheap MP3 player, but the \"artist\" tag was too long to display properly in the \"choose artist\" screen of the player. So, I wrote a Python script to open each one, change the Id3 tag for the artist using a rule I defined (to make it shorter but still legible on the player), and then save it.\n\nThis was not a genius script by any means, but to me, writing something like this is 100x more rewarding than solving a \"leetcode\" problem. Will anyone else care about the code I wrote? Probably not; I didn't design it to be a general purpose tool. If I put it on GitHub it would receive exactly 0 stars and 0 forks for example (probably I would post it as a \"gist\" if I posted it at all), but I didn't write it to get points or something, I wrote it to solve \\*my\\* particular problem and it was fun to write.

        "body": "I'll give 3 I can think of. Or 2.5, maybe.\n\n1) Honestly I'd already learned most of the important lessons the hard way before hearing advice around them. One piece of advice I can think of though that I didn't stumble into myself was that an engineer once said they view passing self/this to a method/function to be a smell. I hadn't considered that and I don't even really know why it's true if it is. Maybe it's true because it reveals a potentially unnecessary bi-directional dependency/coupling. Sometimes I can't figure out a way to prevent this where the pros outweigh the cons but sometimes I can and in those cases it seems to result in a much better design.\n\n2) Not advice per se, but, If I go back, as in really really far back to before I programmed professionally, I saw somebody diagram a program top-down before implementing it. This indirectly resulted in organizing the procedures by level of abstraction and exposed a mental model of the program to latch onto while implementing it. Thinking of things that way (or bottom-up works, too) felt like it unblocked me to create much more complex programs before drowning in my own mess.\n\n3) Some advice I got but debatably not \"software engineering\" advice, I would say it was actually a soft-skills thing. A product manager mentioned to me after a meeting that instead of saying things like \"we can't do that\" it would be more helpful/productive to say things like \"Do you think X would be a problem if we do that?\"\n\nIn other words, it really matters how people feel as a result of technical back-and-forth. I think this can be overlooked if you only interact with engineers. Seems obvious in retrospect but this helped me be more effective when communicating with non-engineers which actually made me a more effective technical lead as well.\n\nI think in certain types of software projects cross-team communication of technical mental models around the problem solution is crucial. So this was a breakthrough for me and arguably made me a better software engineer than any technical advice I'd ever received.\n\nSo I would say to your \"but I wonder if there's more\", YMMV but I would advise to focus on people stuff and notice that people problems are actually more likely to kill certain projects than technical decisions are. And also along those lines I think for certain projects the value is actually more in the understanding of the problem/proposed solution and effective communication around it than the implementation itself is.",

A gazillion people, many non technical, but also other devs, will want you to include something, make something happen. And then again, and again, and again, until finally something snaps.\n\n*\"Just one more feature man! Just one more! Please man! One more, then I'll stop, promise! I need just one more feature!\"*\n\nNo. Fuck that. Not gonna happen. Too many projects, industry and FOSS, die because of feature creep, because codebases bloat- and then blow-up.\n\nAnd people don't prevent it, because a yes-man seems to have an easier time getting ahead in his career than someone saying no, because coporate shills and useless consultants have poisoned modern corporate culture portraying saying \"No\" as something evil.\n\n----\n\n*\"Any methodology becomes useless when it becomes an ideology.\"*\n\nThis is true for everything, but by far the worst offenders of this in programming, are OOP, TDD, FP, and early optimization. The fetishization of \"memory safety\" that some acolytes of a certain language that shall remain unnamed are carrying before them like a holy relic, is a close runner up.\n\nAll of these are useful. All of these have their place. All of these absolutely have the ability to kill productivity, burn out teams, and crash entire projects when driven to extremes.\n\nSo when someone says \"Write the test before the code\" or \"We should really rewrite this in oxidized iron\", ask them why, and if their answer smells like something a missionary would say to trick people into coming to church, its better not to listen.",

Replace X and Y with a language, and something like: todo app, chat app, calculator, snake game, calendar. Those tutorials don't focus as much on things like \"programming fundamentals\" and \"language features\", and will give you a lot of good example code to help you build stuff.\n\nYou should ***really*** try to get back to revisiting \"programming fundamentals\" and \"language features\", but those are also things that are fine to skip over for a while if you just wanna get started and \"make stuff\".

Know the most common attack vectors and how to mitigate them. Don't settle for \"just use library X\". Understand the principle what the issue is and how it can be exploited. Then use the library.\n\n3. Can I fix performance bottlenecks. Learn profiling techniques and caching for starters.\n\nNow you've hit the milestone that you can deliver usable software. It might not be pretty but it works and is secured against most common attack vectors.\n\n4. Can I deliver fast? Time is money and to be competive you must learn to deliver quicker. Tooling, frameworks ai come into play here. Optimize your workflow for quicker results\n\n5. Can the software adapt to changes quickly? The main goal of software maintainability is to be able to adapt to changing requirements. New market oppertunities, chaning legel requirements. Compitive software can be changed quickly. Learn common patterns and practices. Learn about software architecture for differnt levels of scale.\n\nAt this point your technical skills are what I would expect of a senior developer.\n\nNow I just ask myself the question. Can I make X?\nIf the answer is no I follow these 5 steps and expand my knowledge for each step where needed.\n \nIt looks like you are expanding your skills in step 1 and you have dabbled a bit in the others.

Learn about caching and some basic database optimization.\n\nStep 4. I believe that editor/ide configuration is highly personal. Try different stuff and do what is right for you. Optimize whats slows you down.\n\nStep 5. Is best if you have a solid fundation on step 1. Read up on design patterns, soft architecture patterns.

You have an idea in mind and you can ask AI for a working example that you can explore.\n\nLike you ask them to write down an Hello world example of Async API written in Flask with Rediss queue, and it write a few line of code on which you can understand the code structure and then implement on.\n\nBack in 2000 years you had to do that by trying to write you this code, it doesn’t work, and then write in a forum for a guru that reply to you and you pass two-three days for a working example.\n\nOff course asking for the correct stuff, for alternatives, searching for WHY something is done in a certain way is extremely useful.\n\nFor example Gemini have the DeepSearch function.  When you need to develop something you can ask a researcher on the better technology to do that with pro and cons, and it provides even resources linked that you can check to its responses.\n\nThen you need of courses to made experience.\n\nFor me this is another windows on the knowledge.\n\nBack in 2000 one “difficult” feature to write in PHP was write the pagination function on blog/forum/stuff with multiple page. I mean the function that show << < [3] [4] [5] > >> it was a really pain to write and doesn’t exist frameworks that automatically write it for you. I need to say now that all are not able to programming due to framework?! No! All of them are tools.\n\nRemember in programming the abstraction is EVERYTHING! Meanwhile the technology become complex you will continuously need to focus on the high level programming and less on the details. And AI is this for me.\n\n(You don’t now how many bug and cve you bring in your code with npm install when you work in Node.js and multiple library, but you accept it because you can’t reinvent the wheel every time).\n\nTo conclude: the important things is always challenging the tool to learn and use them in the right way.",

Maybe something that connects to work you’d actually do on the job.\n\nAn example for swe is developing a website or app to help companies solve a common issue or task. Then you can try shipping the website and getting users to make it more impressive. Might be a good idea to implement buzzwords like AI, popular tech stacks, etc into it too.\n\nFor data science, something like building your own ML model based on a domain-related data set comes to my mind. You can show skills like data wrangling and cleaning as well as feature engineering and model training.\n\nJust make sure you document it well. In your portfolio give a really good description of WHY you did the project and what is the value of it. If you do ship your project be sure to include stats and numbers that show impact. Companies value people who can identify and solve problems more than simply good coders.\n\nAlso ngl asking what good projects look like might be a good talking point in a coffee chat.",

When you create \"pull requests\" with your fixes, more experienced programmers will have to review them and guide you further.

Like idk you might click on the map and it zooms in but that only works for one spot cause it's using screenshots of the map not an actual GIS integration.\n\nLots of tools out there to do this, I wouldn't bother recommending one as I don't think I've used the same one twice. They are generally tailored to specific tech stacks anyway.\n\nPutting something like that together in a couple weeks is very doable.

If there are designers, they will take care of most UX/design thinking, but you do get to participate and offer suggestions.\n\nDesigners often work out of figma or similar apps, which don’t really behave exactly like a browser, so they do need the programmers help. Designers also often expect people to behave predictably, and there always those ppl who don’t. \n\nI happen to have degrees in both engineering and graphic design and can tell you: if you enjoy coding , FE will be your cozy niche. If you enjoy creating the visual interface and interactions, but coding in general bores you, stick with graphic design.\n\nI CAN do some BE in Java, but it bores the hell out of me because it’s so predictable and stable and mostly boilerplate. Which is why I have never gone fullstack, and will continue to avoid it hopefully until I retire. FE is chaotic and I love it. It’s always new, every interface has its own problems to solve, ready-made component libraries only get you so far and sometimes they introduce more problems than they solve, and that one goal of less than 2 seconds to page fully loaded really keeps me going.

You must correctly escape *outputs* when you embed them in anything that's going to be parsed: an SQL statement, an HTML document, etc. (For that reason, I think that having HTML escaping in an \"input validation\" library is pretty nonsensical.)\n\nEscaping is essential for the parsing on the other end to work correctly, even leaving aside the dangers of XSS.\n\nWhen you're running JS code in the browser, and you set a property with `textContent`, you don't need to do any escaping because the string you're providing is not going to be parsed as HTML. It's just being directly passed into the DOM. On the other hand, if you assign to `innerHTML`, then the string you assign will be parsed as HTML. So if you have text that should be interpreted as text rather than HTML, it must be escaped.\n\nIf you are using EJS to generate HTML code, then HTML escaping is likewise necessary. But EJS already handles this escaping for you. (But it's very important to read the documentation to ensure you understand when and where this happens!) You can use \"View Source\" in your browser to see the escaped output for yourself.\n\n> However, is there still a risk of an attacker manipulating the code on the back-end if I don't escape the input?\n\nThe whole point of escaping *outputs* is that no matter what string the attacker puts into your database, if you escape it correctly, the recipient of your output will interpret it as that same string of text, rather than as HTML tags.\n\nReddit does not prevent me from typing `<script>alert(1);</script>` in a comment, nor should it. Me causing that string to be saved in Reddit's database is not \"manipulation\", it's just normal usage. But that's why it's crucial that Reddit correctly escapes the string when generating pages.\n\n> Finally, I know I should use parameterization for Postgresql queries. Will this alone protect my database from SQL injection (I'm use node-postgres for queries)?\n\nAs long as you always use parameterized queries, and never build queries with string concatenation, then yes. (And as long as you don't do other silly things that would enable *indirect* SQL injection, like reading a value from the DB and then executing it as a query.)",

How many subjects did you not immediately uinderstand?\n\nDid you even consider giving up?\n\nStop using AI - completely. Pretend it doesn't even exist.\n\nIf you get stuck, go back a chapter and start over. Take it slow.\n\nWork through the prompts on paper, with pencil. More than often, it is not the actual *programming* that is the problem; it's *understanding* the task as you cannot solve anything that you do not fully understand.\n\nAgain, take it slow. Play with the code. Change it. Break it. Fix it - **without AI** - do not take the easy way out (using AI) - take the hard way. **learn**.\n\nIt's not Kaggle that is the problem. It is your approach to learning and your mentality. You thought it would be easy. You thought, you could breeze through. It isn't easy. It takes a lot of effort, determination, discipline, persistence, and hard work.\n\nMost likely, you progressed too fast with your use of AI. Slow down. Take time to *truly understand* what you are programming.\n\nYet, again: pretend AI doesn't exist and that you're on your own.\n\n----\n\nSide note: my go-to recommendation for absolute beginners is the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki.

WebGL has multiple versions and a bunch of extensions, and shares GLSL with other graphics APIs (Vulkan and OpenGL), each with their own versions - which ends up creating a mine field for LLMs.\n\nTrying to build something outside of your current abilities is a good way to grow though, it'll show you real quick where the gaps in your knowledge are and give you something to work on!

When you do an operation like copyto, the underlying code performs a loop requesting the amount of bytes to fill the buffer, it then moves those bytes to the specified destination. If the amount of bytes received was less than the number of bytes requested then it repeats the operation fetch operation until the number of bytes received is less than the number of bytes requested.\n\nThe idea being that some streams have an overhead for reading or writing, by reading a chunk at a time (rather than a byte at a time) you can avoid a lot of that overhead.\n\n  \nAlso have a look at r/csharp.

It never wants to say “no that doesn’t make sense, zoom out and do it this way”. It’ll say instead “yes! Of course you can do xyz.

I have some experience leading projects. I'm very comfortable with it. I am not a person with *years* of lead/senior level work, though, and that's what they wanted to hear.\n\nSo I spent a few days running through the stories I had of my experience, and I rewrote them under the guise of *being* my tech lead. Same story, different angle. I know all the decisions we made on those projects, because I was a part of them. I didn't *make* the decisions, but now, in my stories, I did.\n\nI went from getting past recruiter screens 1/10 times to 10/10 times. It felt a lot more like interviewing 5 years ago. I still failed a lot of the later stages, but I don't care about having a 100% success rate. I only needed one job.\n\nIf the rest of the market is lying, then you have to lie as well.

When I first started I would literally filter jobs on linkedIn to states nobody wanted to live in, like Ohio. You will be given jobs in locations that people don't even know exist. A lot of them have barely any applicants. If they are desperate enough they will hire you. Another tip would be to update your resume to have your location be within the same area, since companies might filter you if you are located too far away\n\nIt's a good tip. *Even if you don't like the idea of living there*.\n\nAs you'd only be there for a couple of years or so, then you're equipped with a 100x stronger CV because now you *have experience* (vs **none**), and you can make an attempt to return back to one of your preferred cities.\n\nThis is a far better plan than never even being able to start your tech career at all.\n\n>  **7. Interview advice: be honest but not too honest**\n\nThink of it as like going on a date. Should you be honest during a date? Yes, of course, *especially if* you wish to have a long term relationship with them (such as is the case with landing a job! You want this not as a one week long fling but to work there for years and years?). \n\nBut you also want to show ***your best side*** during a date, don't be **brutally** honest.\n\n> **8. Do not negotiate**\n\nDepends on the person, as you can only negotiate if you're coming in from a position of strength. Are you ready to walk away? 95%+ of the people complaining on this subreddit are not in this position of strength, and thus shouldn't ever try to negotiate.",

He’s suggesting in other posts that Indians in India should get the same salary as anyone in the US for a developer role. He doesn’t seem to understand basic economics, capitalism and purchasing power parity (PPP). Most of his thoughts are wishful thinking portrayed as ragebait content. \n\nCommenting here is a mistake for me as OP is likely to engage in immature escalating argument.

I work on systems far older than I, some as old as 50 years old.  There's programs we support written in the 70s that are 140,000 lines long and none of us have any idea what it does - but it runs every night without fail, so we just leave it alone haha.\n\nWill this put you in a \"hole\" for COBOL only?  Somewhat - the experience you gain on the mainframe is not directly relatable to other tech stacks like the cloud.  On the other hand the mainframe tech stack is much more stable than the cloud and thus your job is too and I always see mainframe roles open online for banks, insurance, government, financial companies, and larger/older retailers.\n\nI've done Mainframe Dev for a decade.  I've seen 4 migration attempts to the magical land of \"cloud\", with all kinds of unicorn farts and rainbows promised with it.  I've seen all 4 fail.\n\nWhen I was getting into it all my Computer Science class, even the professors were saying \"What the heck are you doing COBOL for?  That's ancient, it's going away, it's useless\".  Meanwhile I interned at a shop (mainframe companies are called \"shops\") over the summer and was offered a job in my Sophomore year once I graduate.  I literally had a job lined up 2 years before graduation.\n\nIn my experience coding will be 25% of your time.\n\nAn additional 25% is people that aren't mainframers (business folks, other coders) asking you \"Why did the mainframe spit out this value?\"\n\nThe remaining 50% of the time is using Intertest and your brain to step through decades old business logic and in the process learn both the program and the actual business you support.\n\nThis \"business knowledge\" will make you a critical to their business to the point they can't afford to lose you.\n\nI still play some in the distributed sandbox, debugging C# program error, updating Java classes for mandatory upgrades, and small at-home Node projects.\n\nGiven how my life turned out, I would give it a shot.",

        "body": "I keep hearing and seeing this question everywhere and want to answer this once and for all.\n\n1. The United States is a much wealthier country than most of the developed world. Look at [this link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income) of disposable income after transfers - the US is literally 50% ahead of even many wealthy European countries, and nearly double that of South Korea. So part of the reason why American wages are higher than that of Canada is the same reason why American wages are higher than that of Nigeria or Pakistan.\n2. Silicon Valley emerged as the global tech capital due to unique historical timing. While Europe and Asia were rebuilding from WW2, the US had intact infrastructure and universities pumping out engineers. Stanford, Berkeley, and the defense industry created this perfect storm in the Bay Area thanks to much looser non-compete agreement laws in California (read the story of the [Traitorous eight.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traitorous_eight) Basically a bunch of elite engineers who left some batshit crazy micromanager's firm realized they could only create their own startups by staying in California due to them not enforcing non-competes, and ended up founding Intel and Kleiner Perkins - which funded Amazon, Google, Sun Microsystems, and basically jumpstarted the modern VC scene). By the time other countries caught up industrially in the 70s-80s, Silicon Valley had already established itself as THE place for tech innovation.\n3. This created a self-reinforcing cycle that’s nearly impossible to break. Top talent moved to Silicon Valley → venture capitalists followed the talent → successful companies emerged → created more high-paying jobs → attracted more top talent. Repeat for 50 years. Now you have the densest concentration of tech talent, capital, and successful companies on Earth all competing for the same workers.\n4. The US has a massive advantage other countries can’t replicate: 340 million people in a single market with one language, one currency, and one set of regulations. A startup in San Francisco can instantly sell to someone in Florida. Meanwhile, a startup in France has to deal with 27 different EU regulations, multiple languages, and a much smaller domestic market. Canadian startups have to follow separate securities regulation for every province dramatically limiting scaling. This scale creates far more valuable companies that can afford to pay more. This effect also explains why sky high pay is available for elite engineers when adjusting for COL in India and China.\n5. The regulatory environment in the US is far more favorable than other countries. European bankruptcy laws until very recently would destroy you personally, while Chapter 11 bankruptcies were very lax. At-will employment means companies can hire aggressively knowing they can pivot if needed. This risk-friendly environment creates more unicorns, which drives up wages for everyone as they compete for talent.\n\nAll of these factors combined together supercharge American wages across all sectors of the economy compared to other even developed nations.",

That's not to say that you shouldn't document and do proper design, but balance and know when to prioritize a less perfect solution that solves the problem.\n\nAlso FAANG tries to build everything from the ground up. Need a pipeline to load data from X place? Cool, let's build it. Orchestration? Sure, maybe we get an open source tool that requires some time to set up. Or build our own taking a quarter to do so. Or use the in-house solution that does not rely on external libraries and no one else outside of the company knows.\n\nStartups are messy and sometimes cannot wait for that clean code that only uses internal libraries, passes compliance and security requirements in all known legislations including countries where they don't even have customers and optimize for the best design and algorithmic solution at the cost of spending more time planning.\n\nLastly if nothing works it is totally okey to change companies or to leave the startup world to go a regular employer where the pace is the right for you. Even if you don't get a fancy stock package (that might be worth 0...), your mental health is important.\n\nPS: some startups would rather hire from other other startup than FAANG precisely because FAANG tend to house in-house tools and focus on building from the ground up instead of just using a vendor.\n\nPS 2: IMO, 2.5 years at a FAANG probes you are a capable engineer. So focus on your weak areas.",

Shit happens in development where something you thought would take a day takes weeks. Sometimes you're learning a new area of the code base that takes you longer. If your manager/team don't know, they're gonna just assume you're slow because you're slow. These things should be brought up in standup, or as they happen directly with your team or manager. Being proactive and vocal is the key here.\n\n  \n  \nNow it could be other things that are less in your control, like they could be looking to force headcount lower or your manager might just not like you or some things like that.

That's like... Principal SWE at least, and those roles aren't frequently hired externally. They may even be more of a fit for a Senior PM or an EM role.\n\nBut a regular run of the mill Senior SWE role? They're not gonna want to touch somebody like that with a 10 foot pole. They're too expensive. That person's shooting way below their belt if they're just looking for a \"senior dev\" job that isn't extremely specialized and niche to actually *utilize* their background.\n\nIf I had that experience, and I were trying to apply to \"regular\" jobs, I'd be fudging my resume to make myself look like the type of candidate that gets hired into those \"regular\" jobs.

Their 10 years as an AI/ML scientiest may or may not be relevant either. So that would leave them with... 13 years of SWE? It might be a bit telling they didn't bother to mention SWE experience at all, and focused on a bunch of qualifications and non-SWE roles in their rant. I'm just making assumptions here though\n\nI have 12 YOE, and I apply to Senior SWE roles and get them just fine. Even in the market of 2024, which is when I last job hopped. When I can do the job just fine... why would they try to hire someone with 38 YOE that's probably asking double or triple my salary?\n\nIf I had 38 YOE, I don't think I'd be targetting the same roles I'm targetting today.

Also depends on what he did specifically on the IBM Watson team, it might actually pigeon hole him into very specific/niche things where the only other companies doing that sorta thing would be places like OpenAI which have a lot of competition.

I doubt any employer really cares about his experience from '87 -> 2010 in this market, as it probably isn't that relevant.\n\nLike there's plenty of ways you can screw yourself even with a resume like this in today's market.

I'd have cut all the project/program management stuff, the thought leader stuff etc and try and make relevant experience fit into a two pager, but depending on the order and timeline of his experience he might be screwed anyway.

The issue was that salaries didn't increase in every sector - so teachers and government workers got completely fucked. But us in tech? Doing great.\n\nNow, Silicon Valley and NYC are a different story - those are cities where that cycle of salaries -> people -> housing has been going on for decades now. Now things are someone shifting because jobs are moving out of Silicon Valley to lower cost areas, and that implications of that are going to be complicated.\n\nNow, offshoring - yes, it's 100% tied to cost of living differences. Not just housing - it's also food, services, healthcare, etc. But the same issue above at a city level also happens at a country level - countries with great quality of life and resources can offer better pay to attract more talented people who then have more money to spend on goods and services, etc.\n\nI do agree that the US has a ton of opportunities to lower cost of living - and I think you're right that housing is a big one (with healthcare being the other one).\n\nAnd I think you're also right that the nimby movement is extremely damaging to our ability to deliver affordable housing.

How cheap do you actually think good offshore devs really are? Latin Americans are now being paid almost as much as Western Europeans nowadays. Talented senior devs in India are making six figures. The truth is that offshore salaries have increased a lot in the past few years because as more work gets offshored the costs go up since there are only so many quality devs out there. Also, an effect of that is that the cost of living in places like Latin America, Eastern Europe, India, etc. is increasing because now that they have more money to spend, realtors can now increase the prices of rent and houses over there. So the cost of living in different countries compared to the US is not a static thing, and I think that there is good reason to believe that the cost of living abroad is going to catch up.",

At small startups you're constantly firefighting instead of building, which gets exhausting fast. The farm fantasy is totally normal lol. I think every developer has that moment.\n\nThe fact that you have real AI/ML experience from a startup is actually pretty valuable right now. Don't underestimate that. Sometimes you just need better work-life balance and actual teammates instead of being a one-person army.\n\nMy advice: don't make any big decisions while you're burned out. Maybe take some time off if you can, then think about what kind of environment would actually work for you. The skills are there, it's just about finding the right fit.",

I would use whatever PTO time you may have to take a break in the short term. Do something you like, something that will completely take you away from work. In the long term I would seriously consider switching jobs. I understand that it's easier said than done in the current market but at least with a current job it might make it easier and if you can pull it off it will be worthwhile in the long term. If you're getting burned out this early in your career, then that's a sign that something is really badly wrong as burn out rarely goes away on its own without major changes. So make the necessary change before you completely burn out.",

If you get a job, work there and build your resume until the market improves. Then go find a job you actually want. \n\nAlso, reach out to recruiters in your area. Friend every recruiter you meet on LinkedIn and ask about openings. They can help you set up more interviews. Make sure you emphasize that you’re a quick learner and are excited about a company, even though it might seem boring to you.\n\nThe worst jobs to apply to are the ones posted on job sites that allow remote work. They will get thousands of applicants. Find the ones that no one is applying to, if possible. Also, go to meetups in your area that are relevant to your industry (the MeetUp app I think is still around for this.)\n\nWorst case, get a job at a software company as a QA person, support person, or a sales engineer.

And so on. \n\nAnd frontend in particular was also the entrypoint for every boot camp for the last decade and so I don't want to say the quality of the work is poor, but certainly that very long *left tail* exists and you're competing with lots of random dudes in LCOL countries with a 3 month bootcamp and a portfolio website willing to work for $10/hour.   \n\n/Frontend is saving my butt \\*because\\* frontend is using Node/TypeScript to merge with backend and a bunch of CSS people really don't want to learn k8s and sysadmin yet.",

The way I was taught was that one bullet should be one line.\n\n3) How does \"responsible for making technical decisions on behalf of my team\" help market you?\n\n4) Is this anonymized? \"Making the initial design and POC for a new project\" is useless information that tells me nothing about you. \n\n5) Created a custom virtualization engine. Ok, we're getting somewhere. What is this?\n\n6) Why is Google uncapitalized?\n\n7) api is not a word. Capitalize to API.\n\n8) Move stack to bottom. Why is there Stack on the first two experiences, but Technologies used on the 3rd one?\n\n9) Your first experience tells me nothing about you. What's a project you worked on? What was your impact? Do you know what your impact was? How could you be unemployed since April and not put anything towards this? \"Worked on a custom virtualization engine that improved performance by X% (before/after). Designed and developed API responsible for XYZ that reduced costs by X%\"\n\n10) Python, Linux, Jenkins, all should be capitalized, they're proper nouns\n\n11) \"This includes writing code, managing other people's tasks, and the bureaucracy of getting multiple teams on the same page\". This doesn't tell me anything. Did you design anything? Sounds like you were a junior engineer changing CSS colors, talking over a scrum board, and sending out emails. Am I wrong? Tell me *why*.\n\n12) First sub-bullet point is better. The only positive I see here. Make this more concise. \"Parallelized test suites and reduced run time by 80% from 10 to 2.5 hours\"\n\n13) \"As part of suite optimization. I also made a custom partitioning service\". It's a casual resume, but the grammar needs to be better. Speak in active voice and not passive voice. \"Created a custom partitioning service to optimize tests...\" \n\n14) Why do you give such useless info? \"This role included leadership responsibilities.\" That tells me nothing about what you did. \"Mentored and helped onboard new engineers by creating a X day plan, writing documents, pair programming\"\n\n15) \"And more\". Wtaf? \n\n16) \"Jenkins (Also jenkins api)\" lol\n\n17) Software *e*ngineer. Capitalize.\n\n18) Why is feb lowercase?\n\n19) You wasted a whole line to tell me what the italics of \"Software engineer\" told me. Useless summary in this bullet here.\n\n20) \"for internal use, for department's team use\"... ok. What did it do? One time I sent a LMGTFY link to someone at work for C# documentation, I could write \"Worked on a custom script that linked to documentation for internal team use\n\n21) \"Currently slowly taking courses in mathematics\" is just bad. Just list your courses and say they're in progress.\n\n22) cpp/c? Do you think the shift or caps lock button exists to be used when you feel like it?\n\n23) You told me you used Python... 5 times over this resume.\n\n24) Skills: \"Decision making\" leads to this type of resume?\n\n25) \"Working with vague requirements\" but made the most vague resume possible",

Everyone has already gotten new jobs; typically within a few months and typically for more money.\n\nAs another anecdote, I've also job-hopped recently and got multiple offers ranging from smaller companies to FAANG+ at 3 YoE. I\"ve also noticed an inveease in recruiter contacts since late lasy year.\n\nAlso anecdotally, we've been trying to fill a position in a major tech hub and we're really struggling to find qualified candidates. Almost 20 candidates have made it to the final loop and nobody was good enough to hire. We're not even asking for a lot; just some typical Leetcode medium/OOP/system design/behaviorals.\n\nNot sure why this sub's experiences tend to be negative. But imo, if you have several YoE, then the market is pretty decent - nowhere near the absurd covid period; but not bad either.\n\nNew grads do have it kinda rough; especially those without internships or networks to help them stand out.

And if safety is your concern, the city has been improving, but it’s still better to live in the county.\n\nAs for Austin, the suburbs are newer, but far more expensive. The summers are blistering, the winters amazing, and there is way more to do in the city. If you want activities and live In a city, then probably Austin. But you mentioned maternity leave so I’m assuming you’re planning on starting a family in which case it’ll probably be the suburbs . And if that’s the case a quick Zillow search can show how much cheaper stl is. Plus the benefits are better in the 2nd offer.",

You should visit both cities and figure out how you feel about them - especially based on the housing you can afford. \n\nThe median home price in St Louis is like $240K vs. $560K for Austin, so if you assume that relationship holds for whatever quality of neighborhood and home you want (which is not a given), then that $150K in Austin is much, much less purchasing power than the $130K in St Louis. \n\nAnd yes - St. Louis gets a bad rap as a city overall, but I guarantee you that in a 2.8M city there are going to be a lot of very nice neighborhoods. There are wealthy people in every major city, and those people live somewhere. \n\nBut that's what you need to figure out - how much to buy a house you're happy with in each city - because if the gap is $200K+, then I definitely would not take the Austin offer (and I have lived in Austin a cumulative of like 12 years).\n\nI would also add - a lot of the laws here are not particularly ... helpful if your wife intends to get pregnant. We went through it before all the laws changed, but it would stress me the fuck out to have a pregnant wife in a state where hospitals are struggling to understand when they can perform medically necessary abortions.\n\nOh, also, generally the politics of this state are not lining up to be helpful for people who aren't very well off. And $150K is good, but not good enough to be on the right end of that economic policy.",

        "body": "You might need to think about if you hate this specific job, or if you hate \"working\".\n\nDaily standups, time tracking, etc are all pretty standard in the industry. If those things are draining to you... even if you take a year off to refresh, you're just going to immediately get drained again once you start working again after the break.\n\nThat's why I always recommend *against* people wondering if they should go for the nuclear option of taking a year off in order to combat burnout. Taking a year off will feel amazing, you'll be super happy during that year, but you're going to just burnout again the moment you get back. Taking a year off will not be a magic fix. You need to try and actually fix the root cause of your issue. Taking a year off is treating the short-term symptoms, not the long-term root cause.\n\nI hate working. I only work so that I can afford to live my actual life. I have a very clear separation between my work life and my personal life. I don't like daily standups, I don't like time tracking, I don't like pointless meetings, I don't like having to be available 9-5 M-F. I don't think anybody does. But we all do it with the understanding that yeah, some of it sucks, but we do those things because we get a deposit into our bank account every other week that lets us afford the things we actually like doing.\n\nAs for where you're in your career, it's also not a smart move. You have a year of experience. That puts you firmly into the \"entry level\" category, which is objectively the most difficult category to be job searching in. When you're that early into your career, everything is very fragile. Taking a year long break now, versus taking a year long break when you have 5 YOE are completely different. When you're mid-level, you have a lot more stability, and your re-entry into the industry will be *significantly* easier.\n\nAll that said, it's also not a smart move financially. Early in your life is when the money you save is most important. The money you put into a mutual fund today is going to be worth *a ton* when you're older. The more money we have stashed away, the more money we make. The rich get richer. When you intentionally nuke your entire life savings to do a big year long trip, that's a decision that extends far beyond the immediate impact. Sure, immediately you lose $X. But you also are losing a very significant amount of unrealized income that would've made if you had kept that money invested.\n\nEven setting aside the income aspect, money you have saved is supposed to be your emergency fund. Sure you can afford to live for a year without income... but what if something unexpected happens, as often happens in life? What if god forbid you get into a car crash? Now you need to buy a new car, and you have 5-6 figures of medical bills. What if your sister has a destination wedding? Now you get to decide if you want to miss your sisters wedding, or shorten your vacation to be 8 months instead of 12. What if a million other things pop up? Financial planning isn't about the \"happy path\".\n\nI'm all for taking a year off, traveling, living your life, etc. But I think you need to do it for the right reasons, and you need to understand all the costs and risks associated with it. Personally, I would wait until I had at least 5+ YOE before even considering something like that. If my job sucks, I'll find another job, not take a year off. Anecdotally I have enough money saved up to live for over *a decade* without income. But I still understand it'd be a massive financial decision to actually go voluntarily unemployed. Having the money to do that, doesn't mean you *should* do that.",

Even at big tech companies with rubrics and strict criteria for assessments, the human factor is still the dominant component. The overwhelming bias is to hire who we want to work with.. Now, a corporation could never admit it, but that's the basic truth: sales skills matter tremendously. People who come across as easy to get along with, humble, and earnestly interested in the companies problem carry a massive advantage.\n\nWhat I see in a lot of junior engineers is good tech skills, but not great public speaking or sales skills. If you want to distinguish yourself, figure out how to speak in a compelling way, and learn the basics of how to make a sale. You don't need to become an expert, but just avoiding mistakes means a huge difference.",

Who their biggest competitors are.

If they have a “nice to have” section do some research on some of the topics. Maybe put together a small project or a larger project design doc including some of them. It will at least get you thinking about how they might be using that particular skill to solve a current issue or what they might be trying to do to improve a current problem.\n\nThink and research how they might solve some of their more technical problems. Come up with some questions around them. “How do you prioritize x’s backlog when z seems to change often and requires a lot of maintenance.” Don’t be afraid to ask the hard questions. “With Company A partnering with Company B to build a platform that allows users to do X. What strategies are being considered to compete in that space?”\n\nThis is the kind of shit that’ll separate two candidates that performed equally well on the technical parts. And if they can’t give you a solid answer just know that it’s a potential red flag about the product and company.\n\nNot saying you do this for every application but if you get a recruiter callback on a company you are excited about, do more than just the minimum otherwise you won’t stand out.",

My earliest resume that is not really polished and kinda embarrassing got the attention of a FAANG company, another FAANG-adjacent company, and a mid-tier but large multinational company. They are interested even though they would need to do visa sponsorship (non-US).\n\n2. I failed a lot in my initial interviews at multiple companies (including the only FAANG) since I'm really rusty with interviewing. I was so burned out by the experience, I try to not be such a tryhard anymore. I go into interviews thinking I wouldn't be able to clear it anyway, but at least I'll get free mock interviews with the best engineers in the industry. I faced a lot of unfamiliar tech questions, but I try to do bruteforce and optimize based on patterns that I know. I answered behavioral questions as transparent as possible even though it wouldn't put me in the best light. After the interviews, the recruiter will give me great feedback especially on the behavioral questions, which I thought I obviously bombed. Coding interviews and system designs are also mostly positive, only I bombed the FAANG-adjacent one due to communication issues I think.\n\nJust like you, I think luck does play a major factor in my process. I didn't get into FAANG (or adjacent), but got a few decent offers. I'll keep grinding for the future opportunities. Whoever is reading this, don't give up, I hope things will be better for you.",

Due to the sheer amount of candidates, employers can pretty much pick and choose and can find someone with near exact experience requirements.\n\nAside from that, just making sure that your experience aligns with your expectations for roles.",

If you want to start working almost immediately, consider staffing firms, as they can usually get you in somewhere the same week. It might not be the best job or the best pay for the first 90 or so days before you go permanent, but I've found that's a short amount of time in grand scheme of things. If you have no interest in that, though, then yeah, just keep applying and preparing for interviews.",

Good HR departments know that different people need different things to thrive, and what works well for one person might feel like a nightmare for another.

What you described is accurate but it is likely because it is almost impossible to fire a poor performer in France and software engineering is a profession where it is notoriously hard to measure productivity.

What most big employers do (banks, insurance companies, pharma, etc.) is that they choose 2 or 3 ESN's to work with as preferred vendors based on bids they offer for that position. The tender requires they have x number of employees, that they have been in business for n number of years, and that they exceed a revenue level. They also require they charge no more than some ridiculously lowball rate like 250 euros a day. \n\nOnce the three vendors have been selected, an independent contractor \\*must\\* go through one of them. Even that is hard because many of the big clients demand that the ESN's only send them employees of their firm. They do that so contractors can't just up and quit without giving 3 months of notice. \n\nSo, even if you're the best in your field, the guru; you'll never be able to get a decent rate because even the ESNs' hands are tied by their contractual obligation to only charge the agreed upon amount.",

During my time in university a lot of people mistook me for a CE or EE major; I had more interviews aligned with hardware work.  Most of my CE & EE friends could only find web related roles.\n\nIt's not as glamorous as other areas in tech, but IMO it feels more secure.  The shortest I've been unemployed was 1 week.  The longest was 3 months.  Average has been 6 weeks.  Oh, and I get to charge a premium for my age because the pool of talent skews older.  Currently I'm the youngest on the team by 20 years.  Chances of working in big tech are a bit lower (I have), but so is the stress much lower IMO.\n\nTo put this in better perspective, while there might be 1000 web dev jobs in an area and have 1000000 people applying for them, there's probably only a measly 50 hardware jobs, but only 200 people applying to them.\n\nEDIT: want to throw some extra flavor into the mix?

If you think you’ll need to move companies or positions, a good coaster might highlight their backend, security, or customer facing experience to move laterally.\n\nProbably time to put some AI tools in your toolbox and gain some more breadth skill",

You need to know the basics like correlation or p-value, but these aren't advanced concepts imo. There's a point that comes where there's a sudden diminishing return for learning all the math. It's still  fundamentally a software engineering job. You will get more ROI by learning Docker than reading the latest reinforcement learning paper.\n\n\nThere's definitely training of models but that's not all. You oftentimes just call third party APIs like OpenAI. Or you are building out data/cloud infra to support your model development or deployment. Or maybe you are writing Flask API endpoints to deploy your model. Like I said, it's a fundamentally software engineering role so it's not that different.",

So yes super maths heavy, its not just training the model, they build the model.\n\n3) Other roles are more applied, but you still need a lot of maths, you need a solid understanding of the models and the statistics behind them. You usually focus on finding solutions for business problems. For example, the current models might not work well on the specific use case that your company need. Perhaps you can fix this by transforming the data, maybe you need another model, or maybe a call with that PhD guy who wrote his thesis on that corner case\n\n4) You are also often expected to know about back-end and cloud stuff; again to make sure your models are brining value\n\n\nSome love their job, but for me its just been exhausting - its fun to have a fast pace for a bit… but now it just doesn’t stop.

It's probably a lot of math from the perspective of someone asking if something is a lot of math. It tends to be some fairly basic probability and statistics. (Let's put it this way... I have a math PhD. You have quite possibly taken more probability or stats than I have. I do, however, have the ability to catch up fast when I need to.)\n- What do I do? Designing models, training models, analyzing experiments, building data pipelines, integrating the model with the service that uses it. I'm honestly not sure the last time I called an API in the webdev sense. That said, the backend work isn't all that different from webdev, though it's not a CRUD application (but then neither is all webdev).

I've seen people with way bigger gaps get hired, especially in tech. The key is how you frame it. You don't need to go into all the personal details. Just say you took some time to deal with family issues and explore entrepreneurship, then pivot quickly to what you learned and why you're ready now.\n\nThe fact that you were getting recruiter calls right after graduation tells me your technical foundation is solid. CS First Class from a good uni + those A-levels? That doesn't just disappear. But yeah, 3 years is long enough that you'll probably need to refresh some skills.\n\nThis might be controversial but have you considered doing a bootcamp to get back up to speed quickly? I've heard Metana actually get a fair number of people who already have CS degrees that wants to update their skills or switch to a different stack. It's way faster than trying to self-study everything and the structure might help given what you've been through mentally.\n\nThe business thing with your friend though even if it didn't work out, you learned something about building products and working with customers. That's actually valuable experience, don't discount it.\n\nFor the immediate job hunt, maybe start with some contract work or shorter term projects? Less scrutiny on the gap, gets you back in the game, and you can build up recent references. Once you have 6-12 months of recent work under your belt the gap becomes way less of an issue.\n\nYour technical skills are still there, just need some polish. The mental health journey you went through actually shows resilience even if it doesn't feel like it right now.",

Millions of truck drivers, delivery drivers, and taxi drivers would suddenly be out of work. Progress has been made, like Waymo’s driverless taxis, has been made. But, it has much slower and the edge cases have much harder to solve than anticipated. I think we might see AI play out similarly where progress is slower and the edge cases, which are kind of infinite when talking about general use AI, are harder to overcome than the hype masters hope. \n\nOr maybe someone will release AGI tomorrow. 🤷",

Let whoever reads it assume you studied CS or a related field :)\n\n>WGU just came out with an MSCS that I think I can get done in 6 months, if not a year. That time horizon and day-to-day commitment is a lot more palatable to be honest. Also, my employer is willing to pay for it 100%.\n\nI can't speak on behalf of all hiring managers, but I doubt getting a master's in CS from WGU would boost your application chances. You already have a much more impressive school on your resume plus multiple years of work experience as a software engineer. By all means, go for it if your employer is paying and you're genuinely interested. But I wouldn't do it if your only motivation is to get a new job.",

My thinking is WGU will let me get the BS and help me with some foundational aspects, allowing me to clear the HR paper hurdle for a BS in CS, but then I can remain a student and work toward the MS while having a related degree for those 3 years. Feel free to shoot if you've got any questions about WGU as well.

Since it’s so common for people to do a masters degree when they get around to it (so school is often a matter of convenience versus choosing the best one possible). \n\nThat being said, it still matters. WGU is going to be pretty low regarded, it’s just too much of a box checker. And given your academic background, I can’t see why you couldn’t get into a much more prestigious online program (such as Texas, Illinois or even NC State would be much better). \n\nTexas, for example, offers 8 week terms, which means that you can spread your effort by taking one class per term and finish in 2 years.

I've built a few features based on mathematical properties, and have a decent enough background to know when to apply statistics, but the majority of my work now feature development and leadership.\n\nFor the LLM stuff, the only math I've ever used is basically the stuff of ROC curves, and looking at metrics like precision and sensitivity for artificial and sample data sets. That's mostly been good enough to figure out where the risks are, and if I needed to do a calculation with more explicit uncertainty I'd set up a bayesian model, but it's never come to that!",

Your best bet is to reignite your coding skills. Start small, revisit familiar projects, or pick up a new one that genuinely interests you. The goal is to rebuild your confidence and demonstrate a current passion for software development. Once you feel ready, tailor your resume to highlight transferable skills from your healthcare background and the projects you've been working on.\n\nFocus on building momentum, one application, one project, one connection at a time. When you land interviews, preparation is key. Tricky technical questions and behavioral scenarios can throw you off, so practice is essential. As part of the team behind [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat), I've seen how helpful it can be to navigate those tricky interview questions and ace job interviews. It's not a magic bullet, but it can give you the edge you need. Don't give up – the right opportunity is out there.",

You're not going to be asked to architect Netflix's entire streaming platform, but you might get something like \"design a simple URL shortener\" or \"how would you build a basic chat application.\" The key is understanding fundamental concepts like databases, APIs, caching, and load balancing at a high level rather than diving deep into complex distributed systems.\n\nFocus your prep on the basics: know the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases, understand what a load balancer does, grasp basic caching concepts, and be able to draw simple diagrams showing how a web application talks to a database. Practice explaining your thought process out loud because interviewers care more about how you think through problems than getting the perfect solution. Even if you stumble, showing logical reasoning and asking clarifying questions demonstrates the problem-solving skills they're really evaluating.\n\nI'm actually part of the team behind [interview help AI](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically for these kinds of tricky interview scenarios where you need to think on your feet and articulate your reasoning clearly.",
