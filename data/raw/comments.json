You’re probably correct in your assessment that you’re doing better work than your counterpart in a FAANG job, but in the end, it doesn’t matter.**\n\nTo answer your question about what to do, it’s the same things you would think if you were running that portfolio and hiring: Build domain familiarity with real, practical, demonstrable experience in the technology stack that particular organization you’re looking to get into works on. . Network heavily with people adjacent to that team on LinkedIn or through real introductions from a senior person in the company (this works more often than you think) and try to get on the radar of the recruiters in a non desperate way(The variance here is massive)\n\nIn the end, once you’re “in” . .

They also tend(based on my own bias) to be non-coders, like statisticians, phds, analytics etc., and the technical aspects like package compatibility, resource limitations, pipeline and deployment don't really come to their mind.

Awareness and communication between the two teams is important. Make them aware of the issues you face. Help them understand the importance of following coding standards.

It Has to be able to rewrite all of the data in scope so that the ordering can work properly, so it would necessarily rewrite all the data. That would conflict with concurrent merge/update/delete operations, as at the time of finishing the ZOrder you would revert the rewritten data. However, if you run ZOrder on a single partition, then you can still merge/update/delete data in other partitions.\n\nThe same goes for performing merge operations -- if you can isolate them to a single partition then the system can know for certain that you could not have possibly rewritten data outside that partition, so you can have concurrent merges working on different partitions.\n\nBut that's all you really need it for now. You might add it for `is_active` on an SCD2 table because you will generally fundamentally only be updating current data and frequently only querying it, but you wouldn't be trying to optimise tables with partitioning. The new metadata-driven clustering is much more flexible and effective at that.",

It's not just metadata (although there are). If your clustering keys change, then the files do need to be rewritten. (Edit: to benefit from the new clustering. But Databricks actually allows keeping old files with a previous clustering, see reply.)\n\nPlease let me know if you have a source stating otherwise or if I misunderstood your comment.\n\nThe difference between liquid clustering and simple clustering, is that liquid clustering is dynamic based on the access pattern statistics. If your access pattern is shifting, the optimizer will decide at some point that it is worth it to rewrite some files to reduce cost.  \nThis dynamic aspect is great, but it may also create new unexpected costs. \n\nA quick way to remember the main difference between partitioning and clustering: \n\n- partitioning → directories: determines which subdirectory a record goes into.\n- clustering → files: determines which specific file a record goes into and how records are arranged within files.",

So with a more commercial point of view, you can say, that while everyone can study and get Databricks' data engineer associate+engineer data professional without useful experience, they matter for contracts.

Essentially, almost all offshored employees were laid off, and all contracts canceled.\n\nThe business argument that was made was basically: \"It costs almost as much to employ Chinese DEs as in the US, with comparable competency levels, but a timezone gap issue. Meanwhile, we can employ 2-3 Indian employees/contractors for the cost of one competent US employee, but not only is there a timezone gap, there are seemingly a ton of communication issues, like sudden unannounced PTO/Holidays taken during product launches for example, and even when you can reach them, you're lucky if even 1 of these employees can write basic SQL code.\"\n\nThe result was a much more robust vetting of US based employees, including several rounds of technical interviews, and thorough background checks...\n\nEdit to add context: The hiring practices when offshoring to India were pathetically lackadaisical.\n\nBasically, the process was:  \nRecruiter: \"Do you know SQL?\"  \nCandidate: \"Yes\"  \nRecruiter: \"Are you willing to work for peanuts? (~30-40% of US-based DE)\"  \nCandidate: \"Yes\"  \nRecruiter: \"You're hired!\"  \nCandidate: \"Yes\"  \nRecruiter: \"Great! Though um, that wasn't a yes or no question.\"  \nCandidate: \"Yes\"\n\nAnd let's be real, it doesn't matter where you're hiring from, if that's your process, expect this result.\n\nMeanwhile, the NA and EU candidates I've observed have been going through the wringer, with multiple (as many as 5-6) rounds of technical interviews that span 3-4 MONTHS! (we've lost quality candidates because of this...)\n\nSo yeah, you reap what you sow, and all that.",

In particular, data contracts require preventive enforcement, and if you are profiling data, it means incorrect data has already been written to database systems and is propagating across the business. If anything, I argue that data profiling is more closely tied to data observability, which complements data contracts but serves a different purpose.\n\nI argue that data contracts need enforcement where data is either first generated, captured, or ingested. In the Glassdoor case study above, they use static code analysis to extract metadata from the code to determine what function calls in the application relate to a data asset. Then apply LLMs to this highlighted code to determine the codified business logic irrespective of the data. Enforcement of expectations on the code ensures prevention via CI/CD before the code is deployed and thus before data is written.\n\nMy recent article [*Your Data Contracts Are in the Wrong Spot*](https://dataproducts.substack.com/p/your-data-contracts-are-in-the-wrong) goes into more detail on this.",

Our latest Sail 0.4 release introduces native Apache Iceberg support and provides major architectural improvements to Delta Lake execution. The release also lays the foundation for distributed DML operations across open data formats and marks a key step toward Sail’s goal of a fully unified lakehouse engine.\n\n# What is Sail?\n\nSail is an open-source, Rust-native, multimodal computation framework which includes drop-in replacement compatibility for Apache Spark (SQL and DataFrame API) in both single-host and distributed settings. Built from the ground up in Rust, Sail runs \\~4x faster than Spark while reducing hardware costs by up to 94%. Our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads all in one compute engine.\n\n# What’s New in Sail 0.4\n\n* **Native Apache Iceberg integration:** Iceberg tables now run directly inside Sail’s Rust-based query engine for a unified experience across open data formats.\n* **Added support for the Iceberg Catalog REST API**, including **Polaris** and **R2 Catalog**, enabling connectivity to standard Iceberg catalog backends.\n* **Reengineered Delta Lake integration:** Delta operations have been refactored into modular nodes for scanning, writing, and committing, enabling more advanced DML operations.\n* **Shared abstractions across Iceberg and Delta Lake:** A common foundation that paves the way for a unified, format-agnostic lakehouse architecture.\n\n# Join the Slack Community\n\nWe invite anyone whose interested to [join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free) and get involved on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail)! Whether you’re exploring Sail for the first time, migrating workloads, or contributing code, here you can collaborate, ask questions, and help shape the future of data infra.\n\nCheck out the full release post here → [https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-4/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-4/)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!",

This is called bronze in a medallion architecture \n- A clear area where you have data that has been validated for quality and consistency across sources, with as little detail as possible lost. This serves as the source of data for more comolex/aggregated reports/analyses, feeds your ML models (if you have them), offers consistency across different domains for general business rules for derivation data (when it applies across the board and at a granular level) and is overall the \"single source of truth\" for all your data platform. This is called Silver in the medallion architecture\n- A number of schemas serving specific business applications/domains/data products, with heavy transformation (often aggregation) to fit the specific requirements of each, also optimized for performance for specific access patterns and tools. This is what most users will ever see. In the medallion architecture, this is called gold.\n\nThe 3 layers above are pretty much the standard and have been so even before the name medallion architecture came along. I remember calling them staging/ODS, DW and Data Marts over 25 years ago.\n\nBesides these 3,there can be a number of intermediate structures to help the data engineering processes integrating them. These intermediate layers are more specific to each case, and may not have nearly as much persistence. I have seen designs where I could count 7 layers, and I guess there may be more in some places. But most places will have at least the 3 I named.\n\nIt's also not unusual to have a one or more lookup, control and Metadata layers, but these are more support for the platform than actual data layers (some people will disagree).\n\nI have also seen cases where some of the 3 basic layers was skipped, but that makes it harder to manage things after a certain size.

Tag your top 10 revenue-critical datasets with DRI + freshness SLO.\n2. Turn on freshness/volume/schema monitors at the catalog boundaries.\n3. Enforce “owner-or-orphan” before promotion to prod.\n4.

(I had the same background but also have had strong SQL before I was mainly doing Power Query and PowerBI)\n\nthe Low Code Layer is great with the Other side to grow into Deeper coding. \n\nWhat you probally can do is get the trial version of Fabric with some of your main use cases and see if it works for your team. But again Snowflake may work well depending on certain data needs. \n\nSkills wise based on the skills of your team already fabric is an easy on ramp vs snowflake imo.",

It's an enterprise platform which means it pretty much has all the capabilities you're hoping for, but you'll also need to have some patterns and guidelines to keep the analysts from just building all kinds of stuff without effective centralization, certified datasets, gold layers, etc. It can handle all that, but it comes down to a people and process thing that you need to get right.\n\nThe Power BI benefits are pretty big and I think will be desirable to you. There's direct and native Power BI integration either through direct lake storage modes for semantic models, or through just importing into a normal import mode models. But also Power Query (Dataflows Gen2) are a great tool for the low code analysts that already know those tools. You can use dataflows pretty much anywhere on the platform.\n\n  \nSince it sounds like you have a data savvy team and you're looking to increase your maturity and capabilities, I think investing in some fabric training and help with codifying some design patterns would be really beneficial (if you go with Fabric) to get your team started on the right foot.",

        "body": "I'll comment from a Snowflake perspective on the numbered points you raised ...\n\n1. Snowflake have recently released OpenFlow but it has a limited number of connectors, so may not meet your needs. People generally use tools such as Fivetran to pull data from source systems and push it into Snowflake, or they have some process that writes source data to cloud storage where Snowflake can load it (using COPY INTO... commands)\n\n2. Straightforward to transform data using SQL (normally wrapped in a Stored Proc if you're building pipelines). A lot of people use dbt for transformations and Snowflake have recently released the ability to run dbt within Snowflake. If you really want to go down the low/no code route, have a look at [coalesce.io](http://coalesce.io)\n\n3. If your analysts can write SQL then they should be fine. You can also write/run SQL in VS Code if you want to (and probably in other tools too)\n\n4. Not sure how this differs from your point 1?\n\n5. Snowflake can probably do all this; depends on your precise requirements\n\n6. Depends on your definition of \"seamless\" but making Snowflake a datasource for PowerBI is pretty trivial\n\n7. Snowflake allows you to keep data within Snowflake or externally (Iceberg and external tables). It also separates storage and compute so you can scale the compute power you want to use for running a query independently of the data being queried, and this happens almost instantaneously. I can't imagine a scenario where Snowflake wouldn't be able to scale to your needs\n\nSnowflake documentation is pretty good, and readable, so is always a useful place to start if you want to get a better understanding of the platform in general or specific capabilities : [https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-getting-started](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-getting-started)",

Previously, I've tackled this problem by establishing an internal/master/warehouse ID for the customer/entity and then creating a semantic ID table that allows you to affiliate the IDs from various source systems back up to the master ID. Once all the records are united by a single ID, you can then reconcile the data points according to whatever logic you like.\n\nIn your case, you could also maybe add a column for like, 'ID\\_Type' and give it values like 'guid', 'email', 'phone' etc., where you have CRMs using those things as their unique identifiers.

If you go with Airflow I'd recommend looking into [DAG Factory](https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/) (or creating your own), it is an open source package that abstracts the Python for the Airflow pipelines behind YAML, it is especially useful for simple and repetitive pipelines. I've also seen setups were almost all of the Airflow code was abstracted away by one or two engineers and the analysts only wrote SQL (an OSS example here is [gusty](https://github.com/pipeline-tools/gusty)).  \nMight be a way to help the drag and drop team members to slowly start to see the beauty of code-based abstractions and pipelines, once they see that can just fill in a few values in a template instead of clicking around when adding a new source etc.\n\nAlso if you ever end up hating one of the GCP tools you can still switch them out against another tool and move towards a hybrid setup later.\n\nI haven't used data transfer service/dataform before so can't speak to those vs Fivetran/dbt. Just FYI you can use dbt Core with Airflow, a great way there is Cosmos. \n\nDisclaimer: I work at Astronomer, we made Cosmos (which is OSS, so you can run it no matter how you run Airflow), adopted and maintain the DAG Factory and do managed Airflow, so I am biased towards Airflow. Though in this case I guess I just gave an assist to cloud composer which is our competitor. If you want to look into Airflow we have a lot of beginner resources like the [learn guides](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/intro-to-airflow) or [Marc Lamberti's academy course ](https://academy.astronomer.io/path/airflow-101)that are relevant no matter where you run Airflow. :)",

If you want to democratize your transformations a bit to those that are familiar with SQL, then the learning curve on dbt will be fairly low. You get the bonus of having quality control by having your SQL (dbt models) version controlled and peer reviewed via pull requests. Also control over deployments. Your dbt code should be in a repository with a CI process that tests it and then publishes an image to Google Artifacts Registry. Cloud Run will pick up the image when Composer runs it, just use the Cloud Run Operator.\n\nSure newer orchestration tools like Dagster and Prefect a bit sexier. Airflow is proven, its flaws are well known and it will do you (and many many others) just fine. Cloud Composer simplifies the management of it quite a bit and that is the route I'd go. \n\nMy company runs tens of thousands of automated pipelines on GCP with the stack above, its perfectly viable to do so. Like others have said, Fivetran is too expensive and it sounds like you have straightforward pipelines for the most part. Start with the GCP tools and see how far that gets you.",

ClickHouse is great to run analytics on very large immutable data (super fast because of the vectorized engine, sparse index etc), I'd only use it for that and only if your data is actually very large (or you anticipate it to be in a reasonable time frame) and move the SCD and model layers into a proper OLAP db. So: raw, very large and will never change in ClickHouse, anything aggregated or that needs to be updated ever in Postgres/BQ/Snowflake etc.  But honestly for a first PoC if your data isnt that big, which I assume based on the current CSV/SharePoint/PowerBI combination, you can also skip ClickHouse for now.\n2. Sorry no first hand experience with PowerBI+ClickHouse. From what I've heard it works fine for basic dashboards but complex joins are not fun with that combo.\n3. I'm biased here since I work for Astronomer so I have a lot of Airflow and only very little Prefect experience. I'd recommend spinning up a small dev environment of both and creating some mock pipelines to see which fits your needs better. For small projects it's often the case that several orchestrators can do the job and the decision is made more based on personal preference. Some tips for Airflow:\n   * Use the Astro CLI to spin up a local dev env in containers to try it out (its free and does not need a sign up).\n   * If you are combining Airflow with dbt you have to use [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) (ok, technically you don't *have* to but it is really the best way!). It is an OSS package that lets you render dbt projects and dbt docs in the Airflow UI.\n   * You said your ingest is pulling from REST APIs using Python: you can use the `task`decorator in Airflow to turn any Python function into an Airflow task, thats probably the fastest way. I think Prefect has a similar decorator too. So with either tool hopefully you can reuse a lot of your existing code there.\n   * If you end up passing data between tasks that is more than just small jsons in Airflow, for example larger pandas dataframes, you'll want to store that data in a blob storage. This used to take a bit of setup but about 1.5 years ago a class was added in the Common IO provider package that is very quick to set up via env vars ([a tutorial](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/custom-xcom-backends-tutorial)).\n   * PSA: top level code in Airflow is executed every time the file is parsed, so don't connect to your db in top level code (i.e. outside of tasks).\n4. If there is a good way to do SCD with ClickHouse I have not found it yet. There is [ReplacingMergeTree](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/replacing-merge-tree), which I haven't tried myself but generally, yes, that is definitely a good reason to have the modeling layers somewhere else.",

There are infinite “rabbit holes” as capturing the richness of reality into a fixed set of tables and columns is inherently constraining… build for a set of current requirements, and understand and have a plan for how to evolve the model over time.  There are a number of good patterns and tools for that.",

Do you just think about that or do you try to add tables that won't be used in the code yet?\n\n\\> I get quite overwhelmed with the rabbit hole of trying to make the db perfect from the start.\n\nYes, and you need a way to \"ground\" yourself so that you don't fall into rabbit holes.\n\n\\> Is it easy to just change my schema on the run?\n\nMostly yes.  The most complicated schema change IMO is usually changing the cardinality of the link (from 1:N to N:M or vice versa).  If you're just adding elements (entities, links, attributes) then it would be easy, assuming that your database does not have too heavy traffic.   But even then you could use things like side tables that are trivial to create without service interruption.\n\n\\> Or is what I'm doing (i.e. putting more efforts at the start) is better?\n\nDepending on what you mean by \"putting more efforts\".\n\n\\> How should I know is my design is already fine?\n\nUhm, I have an entire book that tries to answer your questions.

I can't find a way for that except just making a long list of notes on when they took a leave, and then adding back the number of sessions they took a leave.

Most distance metrics don’t work well for this because you’ll get really high values for names that aren’t actually that close. For example, using Levenshtein distance “apple corporation” and “Snapple corporation” (different companies) are very close, but “Bernstein Partnership, LTD” and “Bernstein” (same company) are not. You can look at various text vectorization models on huggingface that should be able to account for the fact that “corporation” is basically meaningless while “Snapple” is significant. If you have enough data you may even be able to just use tf-idf.\n\nIf you want you can then lay on hierarchical clustering or just use a score cutoff.\n\nLast, you’ll probably want this wrapped up with some kind of feedback mechanism so you can make a lookup table to unify known alternatives over time. Once you know that A and B are actually C, you can store it in a table so you don’t have to run this expensive analysis on those names again",

I had a dataset in the hundreds of millions of rows with fields of of text for medical notes where I had to identify specific key terms related to specific medical codes (eg \"Used X medical device to do Y procedure.\"). The problem is that this wasn't just for one hospital, this dataset captured 80% of hospitals in the US, and all have their unique implementation of medical records.\n\nWhere to start:\n\n1. You have to understand the business logic and what a \"meaningful\" match entails. This was especially true in medicine where I had to coordinate with doctors employed by the startup.\n\n2. Create regex for each form of business logic and validate that it accurately matches data for samples. You will quickly start seeing edge cases (note them, but don't optimize for them yet).\n\n3. Create a script to apply the business logic and regex matching, then run it on a sample of data if the data is large (in my case it was the difference between running in 30s vs 3hrs). \n\n4. Apply the script to your dataset (or sample) where you only count how many times a separate piece of regex matched with a row. You can then quickly see your coverage (ie match count greater than 0) and where your logic could be wrong (ie match count greater than 1).\n\n5. Determine what level of coverage and accuracy is needed for your stakeholders (they will always say \"as much as possible\" to which you respond with time/effort tradeoffs). Since I was in medical, it had to be high, but a lower threshold could suffice.\n\n6. Take a new sample of the data (about 1k records) and manually label them with what they should match with. Then apply your script to the sample and determine your accuracy. I often represent this as a confusion matrix (my background was data sci before eng). Id often pull in some of my colleagues to help with the labeling if we all benefit from the data asset.\n\nYou now have levers for coverage and accuracy, iterate on your regex logic script until you meet the requirements of your stakeholders. Bonus, if it's a huge success, you now also have direct metrics for employee reviews/resume.\n\nPlease note that this was back in 2020. So there may be better methods than this, but here's an example of something that was deemed successful at the company.",

I was using BQ before my current role with Redshift.  My company also has 1 department that uses Snowflake, which accounts for maybe 2% of our data warehouse usage.  That 2 percent costs us the same in 1 week on Snowflake as the other 98% costs us in a month with Redshift.  \n\nOverall, Redshift does what you need it to do, and it's pretty freaking cheap compared to the alternatives.  It's not the best database out there, but for the price, I honestly can't complain.",

Keep asking questions until it is perfectly clear to you what is going on. You may want to have that manager attend (or announce he will be there) for the first meeting or two. He has a vested interest in this. Don't let the DE consolidate the data flows until after the training and don't let him do the consolidation alone. ~~If~~ When he doesn't like it, this will give you ammo to demonstrate to the manager why this is a good plan.",

This will help reduce the chance that a vendor lowballs the effort required to get the work.\n\nGood luck",

The query workload will be distributed over the replicas and all nodes have all  the data to handle any query, so you can achieve maximum distribution/parallelism. But note that a single node performs better with double the resources compared to adding another node to the cluster with these resources.\n\nIf you partition data over multiple shards distributed over nodes you'll have less parallelism but might perform better on specific queries or when running many queries at the same time. But a query that requires data from a single shard cannot be executed on a  node that doesn't have that shard or a replica of it.\n\n\nBottom line: adding nodes and replicas will improve query performance linearly due to query distribution. For sharding you'll need a more complicated strategy. But if you're ingesting terabytes of data and already know your workload it's almost certainly a good idea to develop a sharding strategy, even if you'd have all shards on the same node or when every node has replicas of any data not in its own shard.\n\nAnd finally for a few terabytes of data on a cluster of 2 nodes with 32 cores and 64GB seems sufficient. If it's all one data stream I'd rather upgrade my server RAM and cores if possible than adding nodes. Unless the workload as a whole requires more simultaneous executions instead of individual query performance.",

In dbt, use snapshots (Type 2) with unique\\_key = that surrogate and check\\_cols='all'; you’ll get valid\\_from/valid\\_to/is\\_current without depending on Oracle MVs. \n\nFor incrementals from Oracle when you can’t do CDC, keep a high-watermark table in Postgres (last seen version or updated\\_at), and also compute a row hash; diff by hash to catch silent changes.

Then use `is_active` as a flag in the dimension to mark current vs historical rows. But I need clarification: should `is_active` live in the dimension table itself, or should I create a separate `fact_active_jobs` table and build off that?\n\n**On CDC and row versions:**\n\nRight now I'm pulling from an Oracle view that filters the ERP's fact table down to active jobs only—but that fact table has no `rowversion`. Should I (A) remove the filters at the view level and hash the full fact table as-is, or (B) go down to the base tables, use their `rowversion`, and rebuild the fact tables from scratch in dbt?\n\nAlso, on the `is_active` dimension question: should that column live in the dimension table itself, or do I need a separate structure?\n\n**On soft-deleting dimensions:** I thought dimensions were supposed to maintain unbroken history by their nature. Wouldn't adding `is_active` and deleting rows break the sequence? And isn't it the fact table's job to differentiate active vs inactive in reports?\n\n**On dbt and orchestration:**\n\n1. I have IntelliJ—should I stick with that or move to VS Code + SQLTools like you suggested?\n2. Should I consider sqlmesh instead of dbt?\n3. Right now Go orchestrates everything sequentially (sync → dims → facts). Should I keep Go calling dbt, or move to pub/sub for reactive processing? or should i try to make postgres and dbt handle all the scheduling and keep go for syncing.\n4. Should the T in ETL be dbt, or should I use Python/Kotlin?\n\n**On keys in a star schema:** I'm confused about surrogate vs natural vs business keys. Should I use one or both in dimensions and facts? Should my primary keys be the business key, or the surrogate key?\n\nThanks for taking the time;  never went to college and learned this through videos, so I appreciate the clarity.",

So you want to choose approaches that work for the data as it is today AND will continue to work as the data changes in the future, without you ever examining the data again later.\n\nYou should have a test somewhere that all the data conforms to a general pattern of \"number + text\", then extract the number part and convert it to a database numeric type (integer or decimal, as required). Separately extract the text part, to another next column. \n\nYou will then need to hard code the SI prefixes to factors: K means x1000, m means x0.001, M means x1000000, and so on. But these are a universal system worldwide, and there are only so many possible values. You should capture these in a data table that you reference or join to, rather than in code.\n\nThen do arithmetic using the numeric part as you were thinking.\n\nHard coding would break if the data changes later once this process is in production and you've moved into a different project. Just looking at the top 10 values is based on how the data is now: a different unit might be in the top 10 next month or next year. So again, it's a fragile approach. \n\nOne of the best principles I've been given by a former boss: always design yourself out of the processes you build.",

You don't need an API integration for SSMS, you need one for the database itself (just like SSMS provides a human friendly integration with the database). \n\nSecondly, why are you using a long outdated version of SSMS? SSMS is free.\nDo you mean the database server itself is SQL Server 2014?

Grants - build a database table for grant type, then create a grant header table with all grants and grant type id from first table. \nYou would also need a grant detail table for timestamped grants with reference to the header table. This detail table will also show the conformed user id associated with that specific grant. \n3. Similarly add other tables based on the available entities. Add tables to track Financials, End of Period, Beginning of Period stuff. Basic DB setup and modeling. \n\nAfter all of these cleaning and organizing, once data is ready, building dashboard should not be a problem. You may star with less number of table at first, but breaking down data into a normalized form will help you with traceability. Have fun, with some experience you will build these models pretty quick in future, initial one may take time. Best of luck.",

Given your relational claim, I guess you just pull the hierarchy of parent child from the JSON. That’s what I do anyway - if there is a label then that’s the entity name, if not then you need to allow labelling later. You need metadata about columns/fields and otherwise it’s pretty easy. This is just deserialisation and adding a single directional relationship. Anything more and you need the syntax/magic values that you seem to not like. I don’t have a degree in a related field but it just seems like basic information theory to me…\n\nGood you have a tool that saves you time :)",

        "body": "Totally valid. You're probably seeing a few things here. The first is abstraction. Professional code bases use services and third-party libraries for a lot of their functionality, so you have to use your IDE to find those and figure out what they do. If it's a third party library, you might have to check their documentation to figure it out. \n\nThey may also be using more advanced programming concepts and design patterns, and if you haven't seen those before they might give you some WTF moments. They're also most likely using dependency injection, which again might reference third-party libraries. \n\nBut what you're doing in trying to read those codebases is a great idea. My advice is to get help from AI. Ask Copilot or Claude specific questions like \"Give me a detailed breakdown of what this class does\" or \"explain line 149 to me.\" \n\nI've been coding professionally for ten years and I still ask questions like that. It's very helpful. In my opinion, it's actually the *most* helpful thing that AI does. \n\nIf AI tells you something is a library, go look it up and see what it does. If AI tells you something like \"this class uses a singleton pattern to do x\" you can follow up with \"what the heck is a Singleton?\"\n\nIf the code inherits from something else, trace it back. It's not always super important to know exactly how the parent class works, but it's good to know what it does at a high level. Again, AI is very helpful for this sort of thing.\n\nNavigating codebases and figuring out what they do is a core skill for developers. You'll spend a lot of time doing that in your career. If you're talking about an Enterprise code base, it can take months to get fully comfortable with it. \n\nLastly, you might be getting to a point where you should learn about common architectural patterns like OOP, SOLID, Dependency Injection, Layered Architecture, Clean Code, etc. Not all at once, of course.",

        "body": "Most of my job these days is reading other peoples code, figuring out what it does, identifying potential issues, and documenting what I find. I rarely have documentation, and almost never have any sort of design document. \n\nMy trick is to try to find a \"start\". In the language/environment I'm in, this is often an API Map or API router. Then I start drawing or creating a map of the code flow. \n\nI'll usually start with listing classes/methods (it works in my environment) and essentially making a class map, but for methods. What parameters, can I quickly guess what it does by the name or the code? What does it return? And then I get any methods or objects that method creates or calls. I work down that list. Essentially figuring out where I am in the web of function and method calls. \n\nAs far as reading the individual methods, I literally rewrite it into \"make a PB&J sandwich steps\" like this:\n\nIf my pseudocode looks like this: \n\n    int[] myMethod(int pAddToI,obj thing){\n      int[] retArr;\n      for(i=0;i<thing.size;i++){\n        retArr[i]=i+pAddToI;\n      }\n      return retArr;\n    }\n\nI might write:\n\n**Function: myMethod** ?Creates an array of integers based on size of object\n\n**Params:**\n**Integer pAddToI**: number to add to i, **object thing**: object with a size.\n\n**Returns:** Integer array\n\n**Process**:\n \n1) Creates a integer array for return\n\n2) Loops over i thing.size times, adding pAddToI to i, and putting it in the retArr at i. \n\n3) Returns retArr\n\n---------\nIf there's any steps or symbols or syntax I don't understand, I *stop*, look it up. Look at documentation, ask co-workers. My language is not indexed well by any AI (proprietary language, most of the documentation is hidden behind paywalls), and sometimes I do have to talk to *gasp* real people or RTFM. But step by step, I learn the new (or probably 40 year old) thing, and once it's written down, I now have my own reference for what that does.\n\nI usually keep all this in a Obsidian notebook, and I create links between the methods, so as methods are called between on another it's easy to click and follow the process. I also have a custom template that has some JS Code that uses custom \"Calls\" and \"CalledBy\" properties of the markdown files to build me a call flow diagram of each method. I can quickly see who it calls, and who it's called by, up to 5 levels of grandparents.  My real notes are much more detailed, and will often contain a \"model\" of the objects given an example starting point (like values sent into the API). \n\nThe benefit to doing this is by the time you're done you've got well written technical documentation for whoever is modifying the code (even you) and you can build a good understanding of potential errors in the code.  Even reading single methods and writing them out, in \"make a pb&j sandwich steps\" will help in the long run. \n\nIt's certainly time consuming, and reading code and writing it down like this helps you learn how to read code more quickly.",

Above that, HTTP is a conversation that usually happens on TCP port 80, and HTTPS is a somewhat different conversation that usually happens on TCP port 443.\n\nThe important difference between the two is that to speak HTTPS, the server needs some sort of certificate that proves its identity. You can create a little temporary one for local testing, but if you want it to actually serve traffic on a domain name, it needs a real, trusted certificate. That certificate might be provided by whoever set up your domain, and often these days people use \"Let's Encrypt\" for this sort of thing. It provides little apps that can handle most of the work of getting and renewing certificates for you.",

        "body": ">But what if my application doesn't directly run on that server and the request will be forwarded, the server would send the decrypted regular HTTP for the rest of the path to my application.\n\nYou can look into the concepts of a \"reverse proxy\", which is basically a web server deployed by a service provider that takes web requests and forwards them to some other service. The forwarding can happen through HTTP calls, but in modern data centers you may also encounter request forwarding through other protocols that are more suited like gRPC. Reverse proxy servers can also handle load balancing, i.e. if the same application is deployed multiple times behind the reverse proxy the reverse proxy can choose the application with the lowest load as the forward target so that no server becomes overly burdened.\n\nReverse proxy servers can perform so called \"TLS termination\", where the reverse proxy handles the TLS handshake (and is aware of the TLS private keys that are used to prove service authenticity). This effectively strips the TLS functionality from the requests so that an application can focus purely on providing functionality, while the secure connection responsibility remains with the reverse proxy. However it is also possible (and encouraged) to encrypt a HTTP / gRPC connection that gets established within a data-center from the reverse proxy to the application server with TLS. You'd do this if you don't trust the network infrastructure in the data center, e.g. because it runs a co-location server model where the server hardware owned by different entities is deployed within the same physical location.",

That makes it REAL simple... And - as it happens, standard streams are text streams. It's a marriage like it was meant to be.\n\nThis means you implement the HTTP protocol:\n\n    namespace methods {\n    class GET;\n    class POST;\n    class PUT;\n    class PATCH;\n    class DELETE;\n    class HEAD;\n    class OPTIONS;\n    class CONNECT;\n    class TRACE;\n\n    using method = std::variant<GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, CONNECT, TRACE>;\n    }\n\nI'll let you fill those out in detail, but I'm going to still jump around to get to my point.\n\nNext you need a request and a response type:\n\n    namespace messages {\n      class request: method { /* an incoming request is implemented in terms of one of the HTTP methods */};\n\n      class response;\n    }\n\nNow here's where we're REALLY going to build on some of the magic:\n\n    class request {\n      friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, request &);\n    };\n\n    class response {\n      friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &, const response &);\n    };\n\nBarring the rest of the class details, you need these functions. Now when it comes to the request, you'll start parsing the incoming text stream until you get the HTTP method, and then you know which method type above to instantiate. Then your method types implement their own stream extractors, and THEY extract their own bits. So understand that transport protocols tend to have enumerations - whether they're numbers or text tags, doesn't matter. We don't need a data field to store the method, we can translate that into a C++ User Defined Type. The enumeration of all the methods? That's implied by our type instance stored in the variant. That's you enumeration! We've enumerated the method types with actual types!\n\nI'm droning on about that because you wouldn't believe how much code I end up seeing where people read data out of a source and plug it right into a runtime data field. Wholly unnecessary and missing the point.\n\nBut this means that all your IO is over text, and it's over streams, and your types work with ANY stream, including... `std::cin` and `std::cout`.\n\nSee, you don't have to know shit about networking because you don't have to write any of it. C++ is a systems software language, you're expected to make systems of software, not these gigantic monoliths. The desktop and the GUI is not the operating system, an operating system is a system of software FOR YOU - THE ENGINEER. You make this one part that can extract and then insert HTTP, and then you can combine it with other software to do the networking and the encryption.\n\n    > nc -l 8080 -c your_server\n\nSo now when a request comes in on port 8080, an instance of your program will launch, and all TCP IO will be redirected through `std::cin` and `std::cout`. Your program doesn't know, doesn't care.\n\nYou want that shit encrypted?\n\n    > nc -l 8080 -c 'stunnel | your_server'\n\nIt's a bit more than that, but it's the basic premise. It's why unencrypted HTTP is default port 80 and encrypted HTTPS is default port 443.\n\nAs for servicing the request, you've got a variant, which means your handler is a visitor, and of course you can make a visitor that can dispatch to different handlers for each type. You can initially make a catchall visitor that always returns a 501 - not implemented. If you can hit your server with your browser and get a 501, that's not nothing, that's something - proof that your server actually worked and talked HTTP with your browser. Remember, a response is going to be in text!\n\nSo now all you have to do is read the HTTP standard and figure out the nature of the protocol. Are fields fixed or floating? That is to say, are they order and formatting specific, or can fields be anywhere in the message payload? Which ones are optional and which are mandatory? You know - I'll give you another hint, that URL and RESTful resources LOOK like a file path for a very good reason... You can also deliver binary payloads, but I'll let you figure that one out, and it's also common to base64 encode content because it turns binary into text to get past some of the text fuckery that is assumed by the protocol and implementation, like how line feeds and carriage returns get mangled.\n\nContinued...",

Then wouldn't you want to test that it works? You could easily have a bug in your code. What if it works most of the time but fails for small numbers? What if it crashes if you give it a negative number?\n\nUnit tests can be useful for this sort of thing - trying a wide range of inputs to a function to ensure it works correctly.\n\nAs far as where to put them, the standard practice is to make them part of the same repository and to make an easy way to run all of your tests. The idea is that every time you change your code, you run all of your tests and make sure you didn't break anything.\n\nSo that brings up the second value of unit tests - they catch future problems. Suppose you want to speed up your code by using SIMD instructions to speed up math. You could rewrite your square root function and then re-run the unit tests to make sure it still gives the correct answer.\n\nThere's no rule for how many tests you need, but one goal that a lot of people strive for is to cover every line of code with at least one test. So if your function has an \"if\" statement in it at the top level, you'd need at a minimum two tests to cover it - one test that covers the true branch, and one test that covers the false branch.\n\nThere are tools that will run your tests and tell you exactly which lines were and weren't covered by tests.\n\nFinally, as to what to test, unit tests are generally for testing individual functions. A good rule of thumb is to test all of the public interface of any class. So if there are some helper functions inside of a file that can't be called from anywhere else, you don't have to test those, but you should test whatever public functions or methods other parts of your code might be able to call.\n\nTesting systems is also a good idea, but then they're not called unit tests, they're called something else, like integration tests. They tend to have different tradeoffs, like they're usually slower so you can't have as many of them, and you might care more about the tests being robust than them being comprehensive.",

What is the domain\n\nIf you are working on your own you can think more greedily about your own productivity. For example, only create tests when you start developing something and you know it's going to be annoying to test manually (like someone mentioned, a reimplementation of calculating a square root). Another good point to write some tests is before a big refactor.\n\nOnce there are more people working on the project it makes sense to add tests to provide some stability to the project. Most contributors are not able to test a project comprehensively, often code lacks the proper data to test the program, and tests can provide that. In general, a small team of experienced developers can work with less tests, only adding tests were it truly makes development easier. Once you go into bigger organizations or open source you will need more tests, because there is going to be people whose main task is to review and merge code and their life is made so much easier with tests.\n\nSecond, what is the project? I've seen application UI code has usually less tests because a lot of the output is visual. Sure there are some methods like monitoring visuals changes, or component libraries where you can click though individual components. Something as simple as just checking all components render can be a good enough test. But in general the passing test for UI is that it looks good and is usable, and that needs more often than not some manual testing anyway.\n\nData processing oriented code, infrastructure code, and code that has difficult inputs or outputs on the other hand rely more on tests. Like how are you \"manually\" going to test that some data objects coming through your kafka stream are processed correctly so they can be sent to the database? The whole premise just asks for some kind of programmatical test.\n\nWhile 100% code coverage can be good, it is not the ultimate milestone. You can have 100% code coverage but still you are not handling some cases correctly and have bugs in your code.",

But is that really necessary?\n\nWell you know its supposed to calculate the square root of a number, someone else might see the function and think it just devides by 3 because they put in 9 and 3 came out but now they put in 16 and it doesnt work so they \"fix\" the function so it devides by 3. Ofcourse this a rediculous example but in the real world even a lot of short and easy to write functions dont have a super obvious expected output and sometimes multiple outputs are equally possible but you this case needs one and another case needs another output. So you write a unittest to make sure if someone changes the function to fit their usecase they see that something else now is broken.\n\n>What about functions and classes that are simple to understand/debug/modify? Should unit tests only be done for more complex code/frequently modified code?\n\nWell again simple to understand/debug/modify code doesnt equal just one possible expected output.\n\n>And if something needs unit tests how many should I do? Should I try to cover all the edge cases? Or just the common ones that are easy to break.\n\nThats something each dev or each team needs to decide on their own and depends on the projekt. Think about what happens if that piece of code fails and how likely it is to fail. If the code fails and people die you wanna absolutly test as much as you can. If you are using that code to turn on an LED on a personal project well no cares if it fails. \n\nFor me personaly on the current project the goal is to have atleast a unittest so that every piece of code is atleast called once. So if you have an if somewhere in there (that depends on the input) you need two write two unittests so that both sides are called. \n\n>Finally, what scope should unit tests be? It's probably not a good idea to make unit tests for each function, but what about per class? Should it be done per system instead?\n\nPer function is absolutly a viable option. if you know each function gives the expected output and your code is deterministic (which it should be) your code should pretty much never fail. But you also dont have to choose just once scope. You can do some unit test for functions, for groups of functions and the class at the same time.",

You could keep the tests, delete the implementation, start from scratch and the tests will still ensure the new implementation works as expected and make the development even quicker than the first time. If your tests aren’t doing that then I would maybe have a rethink.",

Plus of course bits and pieces of other things like bash scripts and what not.\n\nFor the most part, programming is programming and the specific language doesn’t matter so much.

Most of the skills have to do with problem-solving and structural aspects that don’t depend all that much on language.\n\nAll of which is to say that you can’t go too far wrong. C++ is fine.

E.g. setting up hardware via registers (like a bootloader or OS would), using very specific features directly (e.g. hand-rolling SIMD like in ffmpeg codec impls) etc.\n\nThe applications of reading it are wider, e.g. performance (where it matters at this level), verifying compiler output e.g. did you hit some UB and give the compiler carte blanche to \"optimise\" your code in an unintended way? etc.\n\nIt's also not that difficult to pick up the basics if you already know how a computer works, so a skill well worth having if you're interested enough. You probably won't write anything in it at work outside of specific job roles.\n\nEdit to say: ARMv8 (and ARM in general) has slightly less historical weirdness and is easier to learn that amd64 IMO, if you want to buy a cheap arm SoC or you have a Mac with apple silicon.

The process of taking down requirements, thinking about trade-offs and improvising for a better solution is like a starting point. \n\nThe same approach can be often helpful in building products. You may or may not use that knowledge directly to build fault tolerant systems but the skills you gained on how to think about a problem and judging trade offs is somewhat transferable when building projects/products.\n\nSo both go hand in hand one way or another. But this is just a recent discovery for my own experience. I cannot generalize this. So yeah, this is my opinion (which may change as I learn more and gain more experience) \n\nAgain DSA is not directly helpful in developing things for the most part. There are other skills that come into the picture but it is helpful in some way.",

One daughter who really loved \"programming\" in scratch took a Python class and decided coding wasn't for her. She'd made some really fun stuff in Scratch, with graphics she drew herself, but there's quite a bit more to programming than dragging little boxes around. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the understanding kids can get from a tool like Scratch is helpful for things like understanding program flow and conditionals, but \"real\" programming--even game programming--isn't like that. I don't know how your particular nine-year-old is wired, but seeing what's involved in actual code couldn't hurt, IMO.  So it's a chance to see if he's really interested. And plenty of kids play Minecraft, which isn't peak graphics, so I wouldn't focus too much on that.\n\nI think picking something relatively straightforward is a good plan. You might also make sure that you understand how all the libraries you'll be using work and have maybe tested them out a little (in case you've forgotten something since the last times you used them). It can be boring for a kid to sit and watch while you try to figure out how pygame's init module works.",

Learn as many languages as you can.\n\nThe thing is, if you are only writing small programs, you'll never really utilize C++. Also, just getting libraries to work can be a pain although package managers like vcpkg are a godsend in Windows, and with Linux, well, everything is just \\`apt install\\`.\n\nJava... well, I know it's a decent language but my experiences with it have been annoyance over the IDE Eclipse and settings things up like Gradle and Maven.  So much documentation to wade through. Although, LLMs can probably help with these things nowadays.\n\nI'm a C# person myself, and I love the language and the environment, I am most productive with it.  I occasionally work with Python for scripting and Javascript / Typescript is a must when working with frontend stuff. I have used C++ rarely when doing embedded stuff (Raspberry Pi) and some other things like emulators, but getting things like graphics and libraries and UI was a hindrance to me being able to do what I wanted to do.\n\nC# jobs were plenty, but now it can be difficult to get into among the sea of applicants.",

        "body": "Well I don't know what things are like now or will be like two years from now... I'll say that I learned both C++ and Java in college and nobody ever paid me to code in either of them, instead, all of my jobs were in languages that weren't taught in my colleges at all. While I can't see the future and advice is a dangerous thing, there's a good chance that you could learn C++ now and get a job in Java later or learn Java now and get a job in C++ later. Or learn both now and get a job using some other language later. Or learn both now and get a job using both later.\n\nAgain, though, I learned those languages a quarter of a century ago and I don't know what things are like today. It was fun to learn both of them.\n\nAnother thing I will say from my own experience... without actually doing a specific type of coding as a job it was hard for me to predict what I would or wouldn't like. Most coding I found enjoyable even if I assumed I wouldn't before-hand. So perhaps you would love being a backend engineer. For me, it was very hard to predict. I had to work on real projects with real people to actually know what I liked. I'm not sure if that will be the same experience for you or not or how common that is with others.\n\nI do get that there's jobs that will have requirements like \"Minimum <N> years experience with <Language X>\" and I can get why one would want to pick the \"right\" language as a result. I don't really agree with these requirements as a good C++ programmer should be able to be productive in Java in a week and rather proficient in a month and (mostly) vice-versa. I don't feel like you're ever really more than a couple months behind if you pick the \"wrong\" stuff to learn with.\n\nSo, those are my thoughts. If you are enjoying C++, I really can't make an argument for you to not learn C++. Or just learn both at the same time. Personally, I feel like I got more out of learning Java than C++. This is because I already knew C and so learning low-level stuff wasn't as crucial for me, and I felt like the types of software-engineering challenges I personally like revolve more around managing domain complexity in which case a higher-level language lets me be a bit more focused on the stuff I like. But you could be the opposite. Only you can really know.\n\nI will also say... and maybe I'm wrong about this expectation... but I feel like university students, at least by the 2nd year, should probably be able to learn any language necessary on their own quickly without it being the main focus of a course (maybe I'm wrong about this, though.) Meaning, at that point, the language is irrelevant and not what the teacher is actually trying to teach. It's just a vessel for teaching the real lessons. I think one has to get past the language-learning part and into the deeper software-engineering challenges and other concepts at play. Not the syntax/mechanics of a specific programming language. I think learning programming languages themselves is something you should just be able to do rather quickly as-needed/desired. Along those lines, if the question is... I can take a CS course taught by teacher A using language X, or the same exact course but by teacher B using language Y, I really don't think it matters that much to be honest. If X and Y are Java and C++ then just pick C++ if you predict it will make the class more enjoyable. Whether teacher A is better at teaching than teacher B is probably more important, actually. But, I think there's a good chance you might learn the actual lessons of the course better using Java than C++ so if you really can't make up your mind I suppose I would recommend Java for that reason but my suspicion is that I don't think it will matter much in the grand scheme of things and that it's not as crucial of a decision as it seems to be at the moment.\n\nNot sure if good advice but that's my experience with this stuff.",

So to take your factorial number, what is 7! ? It’s 7 * 6!. n! = n * (n-1)!  So when writing that, (the following is pseudocode)\n\ndef factorial(int n):\n\nreturn n * factorial(n-1)\n\nNow, factorials only work for positive numbers, so put an if statement in there at the beginning to make sure n > 0. And also, we want to stop the recursion once n = 1 (or 0). Essentially, we don’t want to multiply 0 to our return stack. So either if n=1: return 1, or you could also do if n=0: return 1, cause it doesn’t matter how many 1s you multiply to it. That’s the base case. It’s the case that you don’t call the function, thus ending the recursion and letting the whole stack catch up. You usually put the base case above the rest of it, because most of the time, you hit a return statement, it auto exits the function, put you could have the recursive part in an else block. \n\nTLDR, when writing a recursive function, act as if you already have the function working",

        "body": "A lot of the time, I find refactoring a solution really valuable.  By either eliminating distractions or drilling down into the details, I can often cross the intuition gap.\n\nUsing recursion as an example, let's say that I've seen the code\n\n```raku\nsub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) {\n    given $n {\n        when 1 { return 1 }\n        when 2 { return 2 }\n        default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) }\n    };\n}\n```\n\nSo, let's analyze:  I can see exactly what happens when `$n == 1` and `$n == 2`.  The default case, however, recurses, and it's not clear what that means.  I can do a refactoring, making the code worse in order to look at it in more detail.  For example, I can add the `$n == 3` case explicitly:\n\n```raku\nsub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) {\n    given $n {\n        when 1 { return 1 }\n        when 2 { return 2 }\n        when 3 { return fib(2) + fib(1) }\n        default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) }\n    };\n}\n```\n\nSince I've already determined what `fib(1)` and `fib(2)` are, I now know exactly what happens with `fib(3)`.\n\nAnd I can keep doing this, substituting the value of subexpressions into cases to see how the expansion would work.  By the time I'm at `fib(6)`, that expansion looks like this:\n\n```raku\nsub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) {\n    given $n {\n        when 1 { return 1 }\n        when 2 { return 2 }\n        when 3 { return fib(2) + fib(1) }\n        when 4 { return (fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2) } #  fib(3) + fib(2)\n        when 5 { return ((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1)) } #  fib(4) + fib(3)\n        when 6 { return (((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1))) + ((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) } #  fib(5) + fib(4)\n        default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) }\n    };\n}\n```\n\nBy making what each recursive call does explicit, I can see the relationship between the last line and the lines before it.  And I can see that in every case, the subexpressions are simpler than the overall expression and lead inevitably to the base cases.\n\nAnyway.  That's one technique.  Might work for you, might not.  But it's how I do.",

Once you've solved a few of these problems, you've solved them all (for the most part).\n\nYou can turn recursive problems into none recursive problems by pushing arguments into a list, and using a for loop instead, which is pretty much what is happening when you make recursive calls. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/159590/convert-recursion-to-iteration\n\nIn general the more you know, the more you make links to things you already know, and the quicker you can learn more - the hump at the start just takes persistence and putting in the hours, to get a basis of knowledge to build out from.

Your job prospects would be very different.\n\nGenerally it isn’t super recommended to do a bachelors in data science because you’ll be better served with a data science minor and say a stats degree. A lot of institutions only offer a minor in data science for this reason.\n\nComputer science is a very general degree that acts as a framework for you to go into anything in tech. The elective classes you take, projects you do, and internships all determine what you do as a career. That could be cyber security, software engineering, or even data analysis. Yes there is overlap between the two fields but data science is super stats focused while computer science is math focused. \n\nSince it’s so general a CS grad can totally become a data analyst or do a masters in data science if they take the right electives. A data science grad could not do the work of a CS grad just because there’s so much fundamental knowledge that is not covered. In DSCI you’ll barely touch programming outside of maybe a first year intro class let alone any computer theory.\n\nTo go into anything machine learning you’ll need either a masters in data science or an extensive resume. So this Data Science and AI degree would really set you up poorly unless you plan on going right into grad school. The CS degree will be harder but it will set you up better. I just have to make it super clear that a company hiring for a CS position would 100% reject someone with a Data Science degree, they’re just different things. Keep in mind the job market for CS grads is fucked right now but that applies to data science too so given your age you might want to reconsider. I’m not trying to discourage you from CS, I’m a CS student myself, you just have less time to wait around for that six figure job. CS is no longer finish the degree and get that six figure offer right out of uni, it takes time and extracurricular experience now just like any other degree.\n\nIn your position I’d look at r/cscareerquestions and decide if that’s something you’d be willing to deal with (it’s the worst of the worst scenarios but you get the point). Then I would say do a CS degree with a minor in data science. That opens all the doors: CS as a new grad, data analysis type roles, and grad school for either discipline should you want to do that.\n\nSo yeah that’s my ted talk.\n\nEdit: I also unfortunately should say that with the job market getting a degree from a random community college or even a random state school won’t cut it anymore, prestige really matters now which sucks.",

Guy was talking about accessing the registers on the whatever passed for a GPU at that time.

Finding ways to make things work now that are more easily possible down the line in the future. He learned that once his programming skillset had already developed to the point of competency in assembly. He learned that with pascal & learning to structure programs.

Docker was just a small part of it. All docker does is containerize individual processes. You can use either your own docker “images” or install them from docker.io or other registry. Images are basically just scripts to run the application. Kubernetes is a lot more complicated to understand but it gets pretty easy once you get to the heart of it. Services are what matter in kubernetes. They take the containerized application and assign an id to them. Since kubernetes deals with multiple ports if you were to handle it traditionally you would have to manually allocate ports to reroute traffic, however services work to reroute the traffic automatically to the assigned port of your application. If you want to practice you could probably use virtualbox to create a few vms and try to connect them.",

Installed libraries place `.pc` files in `/usr/lib/pkgconfig/`, which pkg-config can use to determine how to use that library.\n\nFor example, you could use `gcc $(pkgconf --cflags --libs glfw3) main.c -o main` to build a program that uses glfw3.\n\n---\n\nHowever, no one really does this, except in very simple scenarios. Instead, build systems such as [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) or [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/) are used, which can take care of this for you.

Without the link step, every little bit of code must be compiled each time a change is made to any part of the program. This can be a time consuming process even today, but back in the day they could measure this in hours and days, rather than seconds or minutes.\n\nTo reduce the time needed for recompiling library code that hasn't actually changed, they invented the concept of relocatable code, that is code that only requires minor alterations before it can be placed anywhere in memory (and therefore anywhere in the output file). Those minor alterations are the *entry points*, typically functions and other things that the library exposes in order to be useful. All you need as a caller is to know their names/signatures, which is why these are placed in a header file that you #include in your program. The compiler then knows the names and can verify you are using them correctly, but doesn't have to care about how they are defined.\n\nThe linker then takes your compiled code and figures out (by size) exactly where each piece fits, then changes all the necessary addresses so whenever you call a specific funtion, you actually call the correct address. \n\nIn order to do this, the linker needs to know what object file(s) each of those header files were for. You see, in their infinite wisdom, the people who created this concept forgot that it would probably have been a good idea to either keep the name of the necessary library files *in the header file* somewhere. Instead, you have to read the documentation to figure these things out yourself.",

He covers this dilemma, among other things, but one of the core principles of learning something deeply is to learn it directly. In other words, you should try to learn something in as close as its real-world application (whatever that means for you) as possible. \n\nWhat that looks like in real life is tackling that problem/project/assignment much earlier than when you feel ready. When you hit the concepts that you don't know is a signal to drill down *JUST ENOUGH* to overcome the hurdle in what you are currently doing. This means you will spend a lot of time in that uncomfortable space but what is often left unsaid is that is the exact space that learning solidifies. In fact a lot of the times the comfortable space is a lie; we trick ourselves into believing because we read and/or took notes on something we understand it, but the truth is if that knowledge is not applied it will decay extremely quickly.",

        "body": "As a college graduate - I don't care what language you learned in college.\n\nIntroductory materials only teach you the grammar and syntax. You're not learning how to USE the language, and they're not teaching you problem solving skills. Your programming classes give you some context for your other classes - computation theory, DSA, applied mathematics... It also gives you some exposure - this is the job, staring at a screen, walls of text, arbitrary decisions, bastard bugs. Is this something you want to do all day, every day, for the next 45 years?\n\nWhen you graduate, your education didn't finish, it only just begun. You don't pop out an expert. The end of college is only the beginning of the rest of your life. WE KNOW you don't know shit. THAT is why we hire junior developers - not because you're cheap, not because we couldn't afford a senior, but because juniors tend to multiply the force of a senior, because we can mold you into what you need to be successful here.\n\nI'll bet when you're done with this semester you couldn't actually tell me what OOP even is or adequately demonstrate it. It's not a judgement on you - all programming and college courses are saturated with dogmas and traditions. They call it an OOP course but don't actually teach it, typically because your professors don't actually know, either.\n\nSo when you graduate, your programming experience isn't terribly relevant. C++, Python... What I need to know is how you think, if you can learn and adapt. Can I mold you into the person I need here to solve our problems? Ostensibly, the answer is \"yes\", so the major difference between you and another candidate is not what you \"know\", but the aptitude you both demonstrate. Obviously I'm going to hire the one with the greater potential, insofar as my hiring process can deduce. We don't have great tools for this - your GPA is SOMETHING but only tells a particular kind of story. It can mean you can learn a lot and make connections, or it can mean you can memorize the material long enough to ace a test. So GPA alone isn't enough. Your personality also counts for something - can I see myself working with you for the next 5 years? Are you going to mesh well with the personality of the team? You don't have to be smarter than the other guy to be the better fit.\n\nOnce you get hired here, we'll teach you what you need to know to be successful. So don't sweat it. If you're hired, it means you're good enough, you've got the right stuff, and that we want to build you up and see you succeed. We know that's going to take time.\n\nWatch out for puppy mills - places that want junior graduates to also paradoxically have 3-5 years experience. That's not junior, that's not entry level. Also, if a company doesn't hire you - they're doing you a favor. Often it's because it's not a good fit - and that there is a TWO-WAY street. You DO NOT want to work for a place you don't fit in, that kind of misery WILL take years off your life.\n\nSo focus on your fundamentals, your problem solving skills, and your joy of the craft. A good GPA won't hurt, either. Very quickly, the programming language fades away, and becomes a tool, a means to an end - you won't even see the code anymore. What you'll see is the problem before you, and your solution will be sculpted and painted - the epitome of elegance.",

        "body": "I remember that. I like Qt Creator and Godot for letting me drag stuff around. But I do not like to work on other people's projects in those things.\n\nThere are a few fundamental tradeoffs here:\n\nThe code is the truth. Whatever the wysiwyg editor makes must translate to code. Whatever the code says must be presentable by the wysiwyg editor. This usually breaks down as soon as you do something with the code that the wysiwyg editor can not handle, like some custom widget for example. To make that work you have to write extra code just to make the wysiwyg editor compatible with your code again.\n\nOn the flip side a lot of the frontend code has structure that the wysiwyg editor can not show. DOM has a box model that doesn't allow you to simply drag/drop a button anywhere. The only way to do that is to position it with absolute. You wouldn't do that because it breaks responsiveness with different view-ports. Instead you would work with padding, margins, grid layouts etc to get the desired effect - but the wysiwyg cannot show that. It can only hint at that.\n\nThis in turn usually leads to people who're used only to the wysiwyg editor to forget about the underlying structure. There's plenty of precedent for that. LaTeX for example is about code representing structured text and styles to render headlines differently than normal text, Microsoft Word simply allows you to make text large and bold to emulate a heading. But the loss of structure also means you can't do the other stuff LaTeX can do like creating content listings and reducing page breaks immediately after headings. Designers who create mockups in Figma _can_ do really great work, or they can simply slap some shapes there and call it a day. But since the code will be the truth eventually, someone has to translate those shapes into the structure anyway.\n\nLastly, the people who work with code all day have a different problem than the people who rely mainly on wysiwyg editors. Graphical user interfaces are about discoverability of features and a quick preview of the final product. Material pipelines in Blender for example work very well as boxes connected with wires. \n\nCode has about information density, and is easier to work with. No graphical tool can fit as much information on a screen as well written text. Copy and pasting text works between tons of editors, but copy and pasting graphical elements only works in the same tool. You can check text into version control and get diffs or even move detection, that doesn't work for graphical elements unless it compiles to text first.",

This is safer and less stressful than trying to update everything at once.  \n  \nFor example, many times when updating a library or framework, there will be some deprecated functions - like version 9 of some library contained theOldWay and theNewWay, and either one worked. Maybe version 10 either completely removes theOldWay. You could go through your code and replace all calls to theOldWay with theNewWay, while still in version 9, before introducing any other changes\n\nOr, maybe you have some other dependencies that you know won't be compatible with React 18, so first you update those dependencies to the latest version one at a time, before updating React itself",

The bigger the steps, the more likely it is to fail, so ideally you have a CI/CD approach where you can just make small commits and daily pushes and slowly things switch over.\n\nThen you execute.\n\nSometimes this approach doesn't work because you're building a whole new stack with different tech. In that case, you build the new stack bit by bit and slowly transition calls over. For example, you might start by implementing one use case on the new stack, then divert calls for some test users to it. If everything looks good, then you can start bringing over more traffic and slowly increase the load on the new stack until that use case is fully moved. Then you add another use case, rinse, repeat until done.\n\nYou also want to have a good experiment / feature framework for this. This is where you can create flags in the code that can be updated live on the running system (which are usually just booleans like `ENABLE_X_THING` but can be anything). Then in your code you introduce the feature flag to divert calls to the new stack:\n\n    if (ENABLE_X_THING) {\n      return // result from new stack\n    }\n    \n    return // result from existing code\n\nTypically in these feature frameworks, the state of the flags is attached to the individual requests, it's not a system-wide thing. This lets you turn it on and off for individual end users, or only for a sampling of requests across users, or whatever you want to do. It also allows you to selectively enable the feature in test envs so you can keep the old tests running on the old code path and add new tests for the new code path.\n\nSo now you deploy it, add the new code with tests, and if everything looks good now you can start playing with it in prod to do manual testing, enable e2e tests with test user accounts, etc. Then you start rolling it out to actual users and if anything starts going wrong, you can always just flip the flag and shut it off.\n\nAfter you've moved everyone over and it's fully deployed for a few weeks and everything looks good, you can go in and remove the old code path. Once that's fully deployed, the feature flag now no longer controls anything so you can remove it from the feature flag framework as well and you've moved this use case over.",

So, if you know how a hash table works, if you know how to explain binary search in detail, if you can visualize the call stack when doing recursive binary search or merge sort, then I think you're good to go and you shouldn't worry if you forget syntax. If you forget the underlying concept, then I think you should just try to practice more by yourself and force yourself to think. So, if you get an exercise that says \"sort this array using bubble sort\", then instead of just using the memorized bubble sort implementation that you have in your head and then going to your code editor, instead open up a notion document or a google docs and write pseudocode or go to excalidraw and draw some diagrams to visualize bubble sort with 0 code so that you can make sure that before you implement it in your programming language of choice that you actually understand the concept and you're not just using the memorized implementation of bubble sort that you saw in a course. That's usually what I like to do, make sure I can analyze and explain the concept BEFORE I implement it in code.",

The features available in ARM7 aren't so overwhelming that you need to worry about advanced instructions you'll find in x86.\n\nAs for fundamentals you want to make sure you understand - try to find some good resources that explain registers, addresses accumulators - it might be easier to start with a simpler microprocessor like an 8051/Z80, just to keep things simple and not overwhelm yourself.  A lot of universities would start with M68k, which I think is too complex to throw people at as a very baseline beginner architecture.",

I would strongly advice to NOT find random tutorials, walkthroughs etc. to help you with this. The main skills you want to accomplish solving these problems goes (IMO) something like this:\n\n1. Creative thinking: How should I even tackle this problem? When I think of \"create a program that does X, Y, Z\" - which subproblems does X, Y and Z actually consist of. This is a skill that you cannot really read your way towards, you have to DO it. If you find yourself stuck it is of course alright to look for solutions to subproblems, but again I would avoid copy/pasting code, look for general ideas you can apply to the problem solving at hand.  \n2. Just experience writing and debugging code. This is another area where reading the answers just don't help. You need to learn the error messages of whatever tool you're using and how they relate to problems in your code. This is probably the most frustrating part of all of this, as sometimes it can take hours only to realise it was some small silly thing that was wrong. But just to give an example of what I think about here (I don't know if this is still the case or not), but back in the day whenever reading error messages, regarding syntax, from PHP, usually the error was on the line above the one mentioned in the error message. Figuring out stuff like this, finding shortcuts for yourself in how to debug your code and general issues will enable you to write code for yourself.  \n3. You need some experience designing systems, as you become more and more skilled your systems will become bigger and probably more complex - and likely also more messy. I cannot remember how many years I wrote code before I was able to look back at code from just a year prior without thinking it was total crap. Nobody expects a junior to create beautiful architectured code, but you need to have experienced this epiphany of \"I wrote this, and it's trash, I should have done so and so\".\n\nOf course reading about code, be it design patterns, or something else entirely is also good. But you need to ensure that actually writing, debugging, testing code is the main part of what you spend your time on. I would suggest only reading for an explicit aim in solving something you are currently working on for the foreseeable future. It is very easy to fall into the trap of reading instead of doing and then thinking that you're becoming better book by book. You need to put what you're researching into practice, without it, it won't do you much good.\n\nGood luck in your adventures",

You kind of design your classes with constructors and methods, while thinking: \"Oh, and it would be nice if I could just write code like ...\"\n\nExample:\n\nIf you want your student-admin system to be able to be written like:\n\n    Student student1 = new Student(\"John\", 13, 7); // John is 13 years old in grade 7.\n    student1.takeClasses(\"English\", \"Maths\", \"P.E\", \"Home Economics);\n\nThen you need a constructor that takes just the name, age and grade, as well as a method for taking a number of classes.\n\nIf you also want to be able to write something like:\n\n    Student student2 = new Student(\"Jane\");\n    student2.setAge(14);\n    student2.takeClass(\"English Litt.\");\n    student2.takeClass(\"Woodworking\");\n\nThen you also need a constructor that only takes the name - as well as a method for taking a single (additional) class and add to the list of classes.\n\nSo there are rarely any right or wrong answers - you simply build your classes so you make it as easy as possible to write the rest of the code the way you want!",

It really forced you to try and understand and reason about what each step of the \"code\" was supposed to do and its effects, instead of just sitting with an editor doing pure trial and error, changing random values and variables when stuff doesn't go your way.\n\nI think the best way of learning, is to try to be as conscious and intentional about every decision you make along the way, and when it goes wrong, try to understand what in your reasoning process went wrong, rather than \"just\" be happy that u could fix it.",

The details of this depend on the language and the runtime environment.\n\nWhen an exception is thrown, exception-handling code is run.

Why? I mean, microservices CAN be great, but they always increase complexity, both to develop and to deploy. If you can't give enough good reasons as to why you need microservices, a monolith might be better. \n3. I don't know what you mean by \"completely\"? It is probably not necessary to learn postgresql \"completely\" (that would take a loooong time), because in all seriousness: your app will most likely not need 100% of all possible performance out of your database. Even if everything you write is 10x slower than possible, it will still be more than fast enough in reality. \n4. Monolith is simpler, Microservices scale differently and can do a clean separation of concerns. Monolith should be your default!\n5. afaik you can just deploy docker images to kubernetes, no? My understanding is, that kubernetes is just a more fancy way of managing deployed images, and stuff, but I am not very experienced in deployment. \n6. Again, why do you need this? Ci/Cd sounds good on paper, but especially the CD part adds a lot of complexity to your deployment phase. If you can't articulate, why, default to a normal, manual deployment whenever you think a release is ready. \n7. Cloud is just an invisible server. You can get a VPS for very cheap, which doesn't run the risk of increasing your cloud bill into the stratosphere, if you use too many CPU cycles. Start there. As with CI/CD and Kubernetes, this is really not a developer issue. It's a deployment and DevOps issue. At small scales, you can do it yourself, but you really don't need a lot of complexity, and when you are working at a company, there will be a separate position for this. \n8. This is legitimately the most important point on your list for a developer, and there is no single correct answer. As with all design decisions, there are a lot of possible tradeoffs. While I don't have a good book for that handy, I would suggest reading up on your favourite API Design (REST for example), because much ink has probably been spilled about that topic. Also: experience. Just build some APIs and see what works, and what gives you more issues in the long run, when you try to refactor a new feature for example. \n9. So, this is complicated: Most backend system have a proper event system / observer pattern thing going, like flask or axum both have pretty good signals internally. As long as you build a monolith, this is really good and should definitaly be used. Kafka is just a way to send signals over multiple microservices, which CAN be useful, or it can just add more unnecessary complexity! As with everything else that adds complexity, start with the assumption, that you should not use kafka, unless you can articulate why you need it!",

You can practice by coding, and by doing stuff, that helps you switch abstraction levels (which you can also learn best by coding imo). The important thing is: no one can have an accurate mental model of 10k lines of code, and that is pretty tame as far as big codebases go. In the last corporate project I worked on, we had 3 main (and several smaller) microservices with about 30k-60k loc each. So instead of memorizing files, I learned the structure of the project. When I was asked, where to find a feature, I could then think through it logically. This only works, if your project is internally consistent, so if you have every piece of code placed correctly. For example, we had all models in a folder, all endpoints in a folder, with subfolders for very large collections of endpoints, all validation code was together, all signals where in a single folder, and so on. At that point, it's just like following a map: \"Okay, you want to know about the bookmarking function for an article. Let's open all models regarding bookmarks and articles, the endpoints files, the signals and start looking if we can find what we are looking for anywhere in there.\"",

Afterwards you can try backend and decide, if you want to pursue both (fullstack) or even switch over to backend. \n\nYou seem to have the best learning strategy already figured out: \n\n1. learn a little bit of theory\n\n2. apply that theory and incorporate everything else you already know\n\n3. repeat\n\nIf you want something with a set curriculum, go take a look at the odin project [https://www.theodinproject.com/](https://www.theodinproject.com/) . I have not taken it myself, but I have heard good things. The Foundations -> JavaScript Path looks good to me. \n\nBest of luck to you, and feel free to come back with any questions you might have later, while learning",

Find some information on these topics and then try to turn that information into working code. \n\nThe things you create don't need to be big projects. Simple things will do, but it is important that you fully understand everything you create. That understanding is what is difficult, as you may have to spend time researching the bits that you don't understand.\n\nBut if you do this for month, you should find you are suddenly getting confident in these topics.\n\nAt that point, once you have that confidence, that is would be the perfect time to start looking for more advanced topics to learn. \n\nPS: Since you are getting into HTML make sure you watch a few videos using this YouTube search topic: **browser dev tools**.",

If so, that formula won’t help you and you likely do need a loop. Since they’re not allowing you to cast to a string you need a mathematical solution. One that loops through each “place” (1s place, 10s place etc) and gets each value to sum together.\n\nIMO the question as you’ve described it above is a little ambiguous but I’m not sure if that’s how it was presented to you verbatim or not.",

In this case n is 2 and 2+1 is the 3 from above.  \nThe last number to add is just \"n\". However, there's a trick. More on that later.\n\nYou could use recursion here, but that's not necessary.

You usually don’t want to expose your program’s internal logic to outside sources, that’s just asking for trouble, so instead you define an API that lets outside sources make requests to your program with predefined parameters about what they can ask for, what data you need from them, and what they should expect to get back in response, and then you build a function in your program to parse and handle the request.\n\nLikely the most common implementation of this pattern is Rest API that allows your front-end web service to communicate with your back-end code. An analogy I like to use is ordering food at a restaurant: imagine if you went to a restaurant where there was no waiter, no menus, just a chef in the back kitchen. To order your food, you just yell whatever recipe you want to eat at the chef. If he knows how to make it, he will, although it might not be exactly what you asked for because you couldn’t see a menu to know that their version of grilled salmon comes with Broccoli while you were expecting asparagus, because nothing was there to tell you so, and you aren’t allowed to go poking around in the kitchen. And, if you ask for something not on the menu, the chef sends you back an empty plate. If you ask for something REALLY not on the menu, the entire kitchen might catch on fire. That is your code with no API, where the front end is allowed to just make requests to public methods in the back end.\n\nWith an API, you have a more standard restaurant. The waiter (API client) comes out and hands the customer (user / front end) a menu (API schema). The customer now knows what is available to order, and what they should expect to get back once they place that order. If the customer asks for something not on the menu, the waiter can tell them “no” before that request ever makes it to the chef. And the chef, instead of waiting around trying to listen to 500 customers all screaming nonsense from the dining room and trying to pick up orders, can instead just rely on the waiter to carry valid requests back to him as a single point of contact. The chef also just needs to hand the prepared food back to the waiter and let the waiter take care of interacting with customers, instead of having to sprint out of the kitchen to drop food off and then rush back to handle the next request. And finally, say something changes in the kitchen — they run out of paprika and need to substitute chili powder, for example. Now, instead of the customer having to *know* that the chef is actually using chili powder and, if they order a dish with paprika, the whole order gets thrown out… they can just order off the menu like normal, and the chef is responsible for knowing “menu item #17 uses chili powder now instead of paprika”, make the dish, and send it back out. The customer doesn’t have to *care* exactly what spices are being used, just that they wanted a dish, had a standardized and codified way to ask for that dish, and then whatever happens between the waiter and the kitchen is a black box, but results in the dish being served to them.",

So they can ask c++ code -> assembly level( not to write but to point out to show knowledge) -> CPU instruction level -> talk cache, talk core parallelism etc. etc depending on job and level however this is mostly intership for me.\n\nEdit: TLDR In my experience you have to solve an algorithmic problem, usualy leetcode style, and then explain the details of the solution through the lens of hardware",

Your programming skills might be very good already, but still.\n\nIf you switch to e.g. Python, you're entering a fairly different world. Sure, *programming* itself stays mostly the same, but the *approach* to *implementation* is vastly different to Java. In such cases, I commonly recommend to drop your ego and start with a beginner course. You can breeze through the early parts fairly quick, but when it comes to details and the \"Pythonic\" approach, you will quickly learn that the Java way doesn't translate well.",

Is UML the foundation of programming? Like the theory behind it, while Java or Python are languages that apply the theory in practice?\n\nFor reference, the OOAD class is assigned as part of the requirements for my concentration in Management Information Systems. Don't know if that's an industry that's becoming outdated as well? Any insight on application and/or relevant careers regarding either topic in the modern world?",

But you can also draw the same diagrams using nothing more than pen and paper.\n\n>It seems like the most difficult thing about this is connecting the dots in your head\n\nI think you are over thinking it.\n\nOOD is about defining classes and also capturing the relationships between these classes and how interact with each other.\n\nFor example, a class has attributes and methods, and you can show these details on a UML diagram as a rectangle where you list the attributes and methods of the class.\n\nAlso, one class can have a relationship with another classes, for example 'has a' and 'is a' relationships are common. From memory, these are drawn on the UML diagram using solid or dashed lines.\n\nThe 'has a' relationship can also be of differing types, for example 'one to one', 'one to many', 'many to many' etc. Again, from memory, these can be captured on the UML diagram using circles, triangles and other symbols.\n\nThe UML is just simple diagram that allows the OOD to be captured on a piece of paper. That is all there is to it.\n\nThe harder part is learning the OOD itself, but that too is not overly complicated as it is about things like attributes, visibility, methods, abstractions, encapsulation, relationships, polymorphism etc.\n\n**EDIT**: I used properties in my description. Google suggests using the term attributes instead.",

Very devoted and motivated people will get the top jobs, and keep learning.\n\nHowever, not all problems can be solved by AI, and some AI solutions need to be debugged by good Computer Engineering techniques. We used to search the Web manually, then Google 'automated' the process. We currently write prompts for AI systems, or large statistical models for training them. These will be further automated, and the people who design the automation ... will use clever Computer Engineering techniques!",

Deal with optimizations when you need to, or when you feel like it. Get it running and working first. \n\n> or if I cannot find a tutorial that is directly relevant I struggle to try and take apart the code line by line in the documentation. \n\nThat's okay! It's a skill you develop with time. The way I approach this is, \"how does what I want to do differ from the tutorial?\" and most of the time I can kinda figure out a way to progress from tutorial to what I desire. \n\n>  I still don't understand how a vector can have an index, or whether it's the 2d line itself that is an array containing points. \n\nIt is always interesting to learn how a library works, but it's not _always_ necessary. Going back to your art example, I might know how to use a paint brush, I might know how to mix two paint colors together to get something new, but I might not know how a brush is made from scratch or what the individual pigments that go into a paint color are. Sometimes it helps, maybe one pigment reacts differently in certain conditions, and not knowing that might catch you off guard. But, it's not _required_ knowledge, most of the time. \n\n\nGood luck, hang in there. I remember feeling this way too, but I can't pinpoint a singular thing that got me over it. I think it was just stubbornness? I tend to go \"fuck it, IDC if it exists or if it's slow, I just wanna make the thing and see it work\". Slowly but surely, you start picking up new skills. At times they feel distinct and disjointed, but sooner than later they'll click. Another thing try is to view your initial idea document as just a guideline. You _think_ you'll use a linkedlist here, recursion there, etc etc. But when it comes to actually implementing it, you might find that your initial assumptions about the project were not accurate, and you'll have to adapt.",

Make your own stuff.\n\nStart by determining the functionality. Write it down. Determine the requirements. Write them down.\n\nDrill deeper. Write everything down. Break down each functionality. \n\nYou will only get deeper understanding if *you* do all the work, not if a tutorial gives you everything to only copy (even if \"copying\" is stretched to you typing out the code).\n\nSome generally recommendable books:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold",

Some people just avoid those interviews and there are companies that do technical assessments of coders without ever asking leetcode problems.\n\nCompetitive programming shouldn't even be mentioned, it's extremely niche. 99% of working programmers have no interest in it.",

For that reason, I recommend at least a bit more focus on DSA than you might otherwise prefer.

DSA might still appear in a few questions, mainly to gauge your logical thinking rather than deep algorithmic mastery.\n\nIn short, you don’t need to become a DSA wizard unless you’re aiming for product-based companies’ general SDE roles- but you should still know the basics.\nUnderstanding arrays, linked lists, trees, recursion, backtracking, and a bit of dynamic programming will help you think more logically and write cleaner, more efficient code in any development role.",

Most jobs will not require you to implement a new database from scratch. You will mostly rely on things already in existence and very mature. No need to dig out your lecture notes about how to implement a B+ tree or stuff like that.\n\nHowever, ... If you want to have fun and explore maybe some more niche languages, then you might run into these situations, where you wish you had that one data structure that is appropriate for the situation. You might even find it interesting to write it yourself. And in very few jobs, you might even be given the chance to work with elegant but non-mainstream languages or technology stacks.\n\nHaving a good grasp of data structures is and will remain respectable. For imperative data structures there is tons of code available online to work with though, and you need to know how to look up what you need and then you will be able to deal with the issue when it arises. It gets a lot more difficult to find good examples or even explanations for functional data structures. There is not that much literature, most lectures don't even touch the topic, and papers can be hard to follow/understand. That's already quite niche though.",

Unlike in Python, C won't check the boundaries for you, but now we know that anything trying to access `array[100]` is definitely an error.\n\nYour number handling logic may work (I didn't bother validating it), but it'd be much easier to validate if it was split into a function that took an array of N integers and sorted it according to the same rules. Then you can collect the input into an array, pass it into the sorting function to sort in-place, and write the results to stdout for the user.\n\nIf you haven't yet, absolutely check out K&R (\"The C Programming Language\" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie) and \"Modern C\" by Jens Gustedt.

        "body": "Yeah It seems VLA do have some issues in regards to some compilers or even get a stack overflow which goes against C's idea of portability, so specifying the length of the array is much better. But does allocating an array of size 100 when we only need 20 use unnecessary memory or is it negligible?\n\nWhen I will learn how to use functions properly in C I will apply the same principles you mentioned because I already hated how my code looked with the lack of functions, so that's on my list soon.\n\nI actually started with \"Modern C\" by Jens Gustedt and I was doing great until I began seeing pointers, mathematical algorithms, argv and argc until I realized it's still too early for me to read this book. So I put it aside and started reading a more beginner friendly book called \"C Programming Language: A Modern Approach\" by K.N King who does a great job at making C look fun.\n\n  \nAdditionally, I did check out K&R and although it is respected since it talks about the original C created in Bell Laboratories for the UNIX system, many people mention it as being outdated cause of the introduction of C99, is that true or does the book offer more than it is being said?",

So I’m kind of wondering if there is another better method to sort it? \n\nMine basically pushes elements to the left when adding any new positive values in the last index, and the negatives are added in the common fashion while taking into account how many positive values did the loop variable “i” represent before adding the negative value.\nI tested my code and it does seem to work without issues.",

        "body": "There's going to be a lot of related reading as you go, but for now:\n\n1. There's not really a great use case for VLAs compared to just using `calloc(3)` when you need a dynamically allocated array of `N` items each `M` bytes large. There's not usually a significant amount of memory overhead for declaring an array of 100 ints if we know we need fewer. This can change if you start doing embedded development, but it's generally fine to have unused array space. Save worrying about memory usage and efficiency for after you're comfortable writing code in the language.\n\n2. Yeah, pointers are where things get tricky for most learners. You use them all the time in python and other languages without thinking though, like when you pass an instance of an object to a function, or use `self` in methods. C just doesn't hide those sorts of implementation details, so you have to learn them to be productive, otherwise you won't be able to solve certain problems efficiently.\n\n3. K&R may be technically outdated, but if you get the 2nd edition on ANSI C (first standardised version), it's still an excellent learning resource. Pointers will still be baffling at first, but once you start messing with them more it should start to make sense.\n\nFun fact: your sort in place function would have to take a pointer argument, as it can't possibly recieve the unsorted array otherwise without it being a global variable. It should have a signature like `int sort_values(int *array, int list_length)` if you want to return a value indicating success/failure/already sorted or `void sort_values(int *array, int list_length)` to simply perform the sorting. You'd then call it like so: `sort_values(array, size);` after collecting input.",

Nice guy who would gladly explain anything and wasn't stuck up about being an expert.\n\nWhy the \"layoff\"? - to improve the Q3 numbers.  The work load didn't drop, not only was there more work, but less of us to do it. And it was no longer fun. Everyone expected to be terminated.   Why? We have bloated middle management who only care about the bottom line.\n\nIt got so bad  that another senior engineer just quit. He HAD to be backfilled asap as the work is quite skilled. You can't put just anyone in these jobs and expect them to cope. So they brought back the Senior Guru canned in Q2 - at a reduced pay.\n\nThe whole place just sucks. Everyone is now only about making their numbers. No help. No camaraderie. No extra anything.  It doesn't help there is no OT, just comp time IF you make enough each week and its approved after your do it.  You have to work at least 2 extra hours per day to qualify for comp time. 90 minutes? Nope, you lose.\n\nSenior nice guy has horror stories about the job market. He no longer does anything extra. He'll let you watch him work but won't comment and just puts his head down and outdoes most everyone else. Making it worse on the junior staff as they take longer and their numbers are dropping.  Guru guy quietly says that management can't be trusted and will probably lay off again the when the Q1 slack hits. He thinks it will probably be him as he still makes more than most. But nobody knows.\n\nNo one raises any issues at meeting. The life has drained out of the place. It was a fun an exciting job. The call will come just before your shift starts.\n\nManagement lies at every call.  They talk about the heavy forecast and how much work is coming. - Exactly like they were before the layoffs. They are probably just saying it to convince the people above them. Its such an obvious act now that you know to look for it.\n\nKeep your head down. Shut up, do you work. Spend your free time studying and looking for a better job. Don't make any large purchases and save every penny. \n\nCanned?

People don't really want to talk about it, but there have always been a tremendous amount of people in the industry who did very little. At least that's how it has been since I started in 2007.\n\nThe reason why it used to be like that is because you used to be able to predict revenue growth by adding warm bodies and new projects, but now that tech (particularly the web) in a lot of ways matured its a lot harder to increase profits in this way. There are far fewer obvious ideas not being done out there that you can make bank on by doing. Thus the incentive has become cutting through the layers of fat and excess in engineering orgs.\n\nGoing forward I see tech as being far leaner than it has been and more focused being placed on building high-performance teams that are spearheaded by high-impact individual contributors. Whenever those teams yield significant results you'll probably see them hiring reliable warm bodies again to maintain and extend what they've built. Even with lower interest rates I don't really see this dynamic changing much. Because back in the day you could just mill out CRUD apps and rake in cash but that game is tapped out.\n\nWith that being said the experienced engineers who aren't finding jobs are the ones that never really applied themselves to achieve significant things for the organizations they worked for. Any body that's spent their career trying to be high-impact/goal-oriented and developed a reputation and resume to match isn't struggling nearly as much right now.",

        "body": "I think I can speak to this. Basically the path isn’t a clear career plan. When I was fresh out of college with a CS degree (sort of many moons ago) it’s been a decade for me. I came across similar feelings. At first I just applied to tech jobs, but I soon figured out that that was just small thinking on my part. There were layoffs (not as bad now), but super competitive considering much of the roles that a new grad would take was not only outsourced, but also those positions in the U.S. wanted decades of experience to work with the offshore teams. \nSo I started looking at big corporations not known for IT with an IT department. \n\nRandomly applied for a project manager position where they needed someone with a working knowledge of computer languages and know how to speak to people. Took the job at a publishing company where I did more data analysis and project management. \n\n\nI got laid off after two years post graduation. At the time I was just looking for a job and landed at a revenue cycle company. They didn’t have an IT department they contracted with IBM at the time. While I was working in medical records, I continued to keep up with cs trends and followed my current employer on LinkedIn to keep up with what they were doing. It’s funny how many people do not keep up with what going on with their employer. (This is relevant) \n\nBelieve me I tried applying at other well known IT companies like IBM, Apple, Google etc  and interviewed but never panned out during my tenure as a medical records specialist. \n\nThen my current employer announced internally that they were creating an IT department. Which led to subset departments like software engineering and data analytics. I also had read in Wall Street journal they had just landed a 10 year contract with one of the biggest healthcare providers in the U.S. and part of the partnership employer acquired a few of their subsidies, one of which was analytics. Knowing things were coming up so really watched for the job posts and applied to nearly of them. \n\nI landed in data analysis and I think it’s because I had a background in healthcare ops and computer languages. I could speak to people non technical and understood how to speak to engineers. So while I never thought I’d be in data analytics, I just went with the flow and kept applying for jobs I got my degree in. Oh and due to the fact that I follow my current employer on LinkedIn, I was able to stay ahead on their partnership with an AI company. Learning about AI company because I had a feeling one of the products I oversee is now part of companies KPI - they would want to use part of our data. Now I’m on the project that integrates data that flows through the product I built into AI companies platform. \n\nSorry it was a novel, but I wanted to share my experience because it’s so unconventional and yet familiar to others as well on their career path. ",

        "body": "Recent data shows job postings dropped by about 13.8% last month; therefore, finding stable work has become increasingly difficult. It’s not just AI or layoffs, the market is flooded with graduates while global uncertainty keeps shaking investments. Still, there’s work out there, just more fragmented across projects and smaller companies. Many have found unexpected roles. One friend in Germany started education consulting after a casual meeting and has been working remotely for six years. Another with a sociology degree became an accountant for a firm hiring across Canada, France, and Turkey. Not all paths are straight lines.\n\nTo stay adaptable, it helps to build flexible income streams. Creating profiles on Fiverr or Upwork, keeping resumes [ATS-friendly](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumereview/comments/1jsb9a8/4_steps_to_creating_a_jobwinning_resume_resume/), and applying through sites like [hiring.Cafe](http://hiring.Cafe) that pull listings from company pages can make a difference. Following the [developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/) who contacted recruiter firms on Google Maps is another option. Some applications won’t lead anywhere at first, but eventually, there will be a response from somewhere. The market feels unpredictable, yet people are still finding their way.",

To me anytime someone from a non FAANG company asks a leetcode question I just know they put 0 thought into their hiring process and probably have a revolving door of engineers. FAANG does it because they have 10s of thousands of applicants and teams etc. You are just copying them when you only have one product, you are not the same.\n\nIts like you said companies that don't ask leetcode or are smaller tend to pay less but they still pay well. I know tons of engineers clearing 180-200k working at companies you have never even heard of.",

Pay is shitty but would you personally take a job with shitty pay for swe?\n\nI was at a private non-tech company in a non-tech city working on safety critical medical devices, think dialysis machines, for 15 years  It was my first job at out school in 2006 and I made 42.5K.  At the end I was leading teams of 20 SWEs on multi-year cross functional projects making 110K.\n\nPeople will ask, why didn't you leave?  The answer was I was never good enough to find another job when I decided to start looking.  The problem was my experiences didn't match the YOE or title at other companies.\n\nAt the end of the day I was working at a non-tech company, their goal was pumping out features and meeting the bare minimum of FDA guidelines, not creating quality code.  Lots of things I know tech companies do this company had no interest in doing.\n\nI even worked in my free time to develop a prototype of how something like Jenkins could help by running automated tests nightly.  When management found out they literally told me \"if you want to work extra on the weekends work on project priorities or don't work on anything at all.\"  The issue was management didn't care about things I was trying to solve.\n\nThey were content with the speed of development, which was slow.  They were content with how automated testing were run at the whim of people who owned the tests and sometimes issues would be found late in to the process.  They were content with all the tech debt, because it wasn't preventing them from meeting their goals of getting FDA approval.\n\nAt the end of the day they know creating an FDA approved medical device takes a long time and they were confident they could talk away any issues that did not affect patient safety. There were 100's of bugs that did not affect patient safety in the bug tracker, but fixing them was only priority when doctors or patients complained. \n\nI'm not saying ever place is like this, but that has been my experience which really soured me on working at companies like this.  Sadly I'm not smart enough to get in to real tech companies, so I just have to deal with what I can get.",

If I get laid off again, that's freeing tbh. Because then I can explore something else and it's not at the expense of me being worried I quit my job, I got let go. \n\n\nBut that's also because I have no debt and a healthy safety fund. I've also interviewed for jobs that weren't even swe jobs but the domain knowledge from my swe gigs was very valuable to them. So become interdisciplinary early on or seriously make sure you understand whatever field you're in bc a liaison between tech and something else is invaluable. ",

It probably didn't help him get the initial interview, since I think that was more about the fact that we were recruiting at his school, but it definitely helped him stand out during the interview process. When we were in discussions about the new grad class, that project was mentioned often and certainly kept him above the fold. It should be noted that he had to pass the interview solely on technical merits.\n\nOne side point with this is that he was extremely difficult to work with because of this. He kept mentioning how he had built an app with thousands of users so he knew what he was talking about. We were building a company at petabyte scale with millions of users, so his experience was not particularly applicable. Not saying that you're like this, but it's something to be aware of. It shows that you're a go-getter and good at figuring things out, which are important qualities of a great SWE, but a SWE role at a big company is an entirely different skill set than a successful app builder.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, I was able to land my first internship through a successful project. The thing that made my experience different from yours is that our app had very few users but a ton of publicity (it was kind of a wacky idea). This helped recruiters find us. All of the members of our team landed internships by responding to social media posts about our project. I also think that the companies liked the marketing aspect of \"look at these fun young founders working for OUR company.\"\n\nIn short, I think having a successful project is great during an interview, but having a highly publicized project is better for getting your foot in the door.",

(Yes I know that's what NDAs are for, but I've meet some really paranoid people in this industry). If I were you I'd try to downplay how many paying customers you've got (congrats on that btw, it takes a lot of work to get anyone willing to pay for an app and that number is not insignificant), and focus more on your technical abilities.\n\nGood luck on the job hunt, from the sounds of things you'd be a great asset for any company to bring on, and hopefully one of them will realise this.",

The question I am going to poke at is how well will you work on a team.  What are some bad habits I am going to have to worry about? I am going to poke to see how arrogent you are, This followed up by how well do you take being wrong or pushed back on.  Also see how well you will take being assigned grunt work.

It wasn’t until my first day my manager found out I had just graduated. I think she was surprised…but I never really lied. I guess on that application sure but not before they gave me the offer. All went well after she didn’t really care (and if she did well then I could just say well it was on my resume🧍🏽‍♀️) but I did have a lot of unwanted anxiety before I spilled the news LOL.",

Until people start developing a sense of common cause among all their brothers and sisters who work (this \\*includes\\* commonly demonized people like H1Bs, Indian workers, people on temporary contracts, etc), instead of approaching it from the direction of \"but how can I get mine?\", talk of unionizing is dead air.\n\nI'm hardly a labor scholar but I think an important precondition is a shift toward cultural solidarity of workers over employers. The first movers here, as in any labor struggle, will likely be casualties. Workplaces will -- as has been happening -- retaliate. People will be fired and blacklisted, whole departments shuttered, etc.\n\nIn the \\*absence\\* of a broader cultural context around labor consciousness, the lesson these retaliations teach is \"that was a bad move, you can't win\". Whereas in a context of solidarity, it is more acceptable to take personal risks to advance the greater good. You have to be willing to do things that might get \\*you personally\\* fucked, in order to advance the interests of labor, the common good, which I think most people today are very, very far from.",

Simply because the people here are complaining about work hours, pay but hey over there in this other country we can abuse the living shit out of people and our operating costs are lower.\n\nSecondly, software developer position is highly dependent on the thing/service the company is trying to make. For example, a person sitting in pakistan or india can make the same website/app that any person any american software developer can make. Moreover, these people will bend over backwards to adjust to the american demand. \n\nThirdly, unions will demoralize and depress the high salaries one can find in tech companies. Again, for example pilots in air canada are paid bonkers and the union has to constantly fight against the corporation to hold a bargain. \n\nFourthly, the supply of software engineers is slightly higher than the demand at the current moment. This will overall negatively impact the strength of the movement. A new grad software developer doesn't have the leverage to bargain for higher salary because of inexperience.\n\nThis is however, not the end. If you want, push the law makers and politicians, collective force to lobby the government into taxing the companies which outsource or use more AI. The way I see the current problem in software industry is that, the big players want to cash in on the AI demand, the mid level companies are trying to make a product which will earn them the attention from big companies. The government is only interested in sucking rich peoples' cocks. There is nothing to stand in the way.\n\nOther commenter u/dontping mentioned some other pathways, which are viable but they demand more time and effort than the current market is willing to deploy. Don't get me wrong, this is a great idea but to do this there has to be a way to back industry into a corner without getting the economy fucked.",

Then interest rates came down to zero and there was a big push to make everyone move to city centers and in office in the US for collaboration because they thought in office collaboration was faster and more innovative. THAT’s when US hiring really boomed as did the salaries. But once Covid hit and people are like “ we are as productive at home!”, so are people in India or Canada.  There was no reason to hire Americans who stayed home. It was too expensive. You got paid big bucks for being in person. And anything people got in 2021 was always an anomaly which was being corrected. A lot of people predicted that this was going to happen. They were downvoted to oblivion though. ",

Extremely senior roles actually have less equitable job prospects in the open market at any given point in time, and as a result most businesses will \"sideline you\" while you figure out your next move.

Takes time to connect to your network, make a role for you, or work into an existing hiring process. \n\nWhat it also may look like in a mass-layoff type scenario is that you need to layoff a significant amount of your team, then you \"get fired\".

As a manager or director, you're responsible for certain OKRs and project deliveries. It's inevitable that there will be some bad projects out there, either in tech talent of the team, bad product vision, or operational politics, only some of which the manager can control. The last director I knew who left not on his own accord was fired (or you know, replaced, 'left to pursue other opportunities' or whatever) was fired because his project went against architectural guidelines which led to risks that the business was unable to accept.\n\nIt's also expensive to lay off directors, and VPs especially. At a certain level, you can negotiate your own exit package that is nonstandard. So, I think there's some second thought that always goes into laying off at higher levels because of that.",

It isn't guaranteed of course but for L3+ with a good performance record, you have a shot. In the short term it may be worth the trouble to get a short term rental with a less insane commute while you decide if the role is a good fit.\n\nYou should absolutely include RSUs in your consideration for this role. Stripe has had 1-2 tender offers annually for the last couple years so there are plenty of chances to get liquidity. Yes, RSU grants are taxed at your marginal income tax rate (about 50% for me), and you will pay capital gains if your shares increase on value after vesting (this is a good problem to have). If you are a high performer, you can stack additional RSU grants that vest over 1-2 years and sweeten the deal considerably.\n\nWLB varies by team of course but I don't think it's as bad as some people say. You can try to get opinions for your team/org by asking on Blind. It's definitely not a place where you can coast but I rarely work over 40 hours a week. Being a good communicator is critical here (as in many big techs).\n\nPIPs do happen but you should give yourself some credit - passing the interviews and getting an offer is not trivial and it means that you have a good shot at succeeding.\n\nIt opens doors for you career-wise in tangible ways (learning new skills) and intangible ways (brand recogniziton, relocation opportunities to the US, that kind of thing). Depending on your goals and lifestyle values you might find that it's a smart move. Good luck!",

My dad worked from home so that he could be there in the morning to get us ready and drop us off. Both compromised significantly - both by declining promotions, and by staying with companies that afforded them more flexibility over those that paid better. They turned down Google offers because it was known for being a very hard place to work at the time, so it's kind of funny that FAANG is seen as kind of a golden ticket these days.\n\nSo long and short is that you will have to compromise - either in terms of career progression or not being with your kids - if you feel you're hitting your limit.

Both fields have their pros and cons, for me tech was more what I wanted to do and had a lot less cons.\n\nAs far as electrical goes the pros are you will always have a job, you don’t need to worry about being replaced by Ai, you aren’t getting laid off and not finding a job (there are layoffs, more so in residential if the economy has a downturn but there are other jobs you can get quickly still). The pay is also good state dependent, I made about 70k year 1, year 2 I was close to 6 figures, and the next several years I was ~120-200k depending on overtime and how much I wanted to work.\n\nThe negatives: you often get shit work days (weekends, nights), poor pto, work holidays, work in hazardous environments, it’s hard on your body, and you work with people who HR would have a meltdown if they heard for 5 minutes (gay jokes, teasing you, political talk, stuff some aren’t comfortable with I didn’t mind but I’ve seen several people quit a week or 2 in over it). \n\nI’d recommend industrial if you go the path. It’s more dangerous as you work with big stuff but you keep plants running like you can work for a refinery, brewery, stuff like that. You aren’t in peoples houses and you aren’t messing with code stuff all the time and you have constant work, they usually get paid the best depending on the place.\n\nIf you have any questions or anyone else does feel free to ask.

Work in your own home is very different from someone else's, because the reward centers in your brain are different.\n\nI renovated my current house. I did 90% of the 120V work myself and 100% of the low voltage. I had some of the skills and watched hours of YouTube and asked contractor friends' input for the gaps. I fucketh not with 240V so my electrician FIL did that and the rest of the 120V that was a gap in my (electrical) code knowledge because I'd never wired a kitchen.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the work of running cables and changing outlets, it's physical labor that I couldn't see myself doing to bread on the table. It's something that I will enthusiastically undertake to help someone else.\n\nI'd recommend trying more development roles before exiting for skilled trades. Try a big company. Try a medium company. Startups can be rewarding, yet gruelling and a bad experience to some.",

If you're in the US, this might be China. It's advantageous in such cases for the company because then there isn't one day lag in email responses, for example. I don't have any names for you, but you might look for postings that list knowing Chinese as a \"nice to have\".",

Also you might have meetings at anywhere in work hours.\n\nSo you cannot simply work 2-10 because you want to. That means nobody can reach you before 2, and you won’t make it to meetings before 2.\n\nIn my experience permanent deviations from work hours usually require you have a special situation and need accommodation for that. Then your manager can arrange this and everybody knows they cannot reach you at some hours. And meetings that need to involve you are not scheduled to those hours. But even in this case 2-10 is a big stretch. Practically no company will support this permanently.\n\nI sometimes do and see people do something else: You start your day at the beginning of the work hours, check in and be available but do not actively work. When somebody needs to reach you, you respond. If you have a meeting you join. Then when it’s 2, you start actively working. After official work hours end you continue working until 10, but tone the communication down and stop answering to people who want to reach out, until next day. But this is usually more difficult than working regular hours. And I only do this temporary basis. Edit: Apparently this only makes sense for remote work. If you need to go to office at 9, there is no sense in not actively working.",

Might want to spend an hour or two a night getting ramped up on running LLMs locally and MCP/RAG for the agentic stuff as that’s where all the funding is right now, and you already have solid domain/industry experience.  \n\nI know downskilling sounds like an attractive option but sometimes you just gotta put ten toes down and stand on business.  There are plenty of hands on CTO roles out there looking for real experience right now.  I’m not saying don’t try for the SDE roles but just pointing out there is a path where you can both get more hands on and keep a path in the csuite.  Check out stuff like execthread and wellfound, and just know that recruiting for this stuff doesn’t happen on the normal channels so try to figure out what’s the best path in your ideal industry and what’s available around your local market as well.

So doing projects that involve cloud infra or general dev op CI/CD pipeline I think would be really helpful. For example if a job posting goes up and outside of the basic \"must know javascript/react bla bla\" theres probably also going to be a line or two somewhere about knowing something in cloud like AWS Lambda and knowing some infrastructure stuff. Even for the \"SWE I\" roles. If a recruiter sees your resume and cant instantly draw that link for AWS Lambda for example they are likely to scrap it. Its annoying but that how it is with cold applying right now.\n\nYou also have your degree in computer engineering, im curious to what job positions you are actually applying to. You should still qualify for early career new grad stuff along with internships which sounds like you are also applying to but have you tried stuff out side of the web dev space? Like embedded stuff/robotics etc? Heck honestly you could probably read a C/C++ book and open up a whole new world for yourself.",

This system does has its perks that you can escape a bad fit the second rotation, and you get to try new things. \n\nBut internally? There’s a lot of teams who hate TDP/Coda hires because they are basically assigned one and they can be a net negative. That attitude is awful in a pip culture because everyone already wants to save themselves and claim as much visibility as possible (first person to turn in performance reviews can claim milestones and others then have to go to extra efforts disprove them). Imagine being a senior engineer and you want to help the junior get up to speed but if you do, you likely going to get pipped for not delivering more of your own tasks. Years ago, they apparently counted mentoring, interviewing, and similar activities as a bonus point towards performance and now it’s almost a negative. \n\nYes, yes. If you don’t end up in Card/similar, and get placed in Cloud in C1 you can barely do any work and not get pipped compared more competitive orgs (I know someone in cloud who admitted that they should get pipped but their manager is too lazy and finds it easier to just lie about their performance and cloud is less aggressive on pip). \n\nBut you really don’t want to roll that dice",

The only sustainable move for specialists to make is to get into leadership. Preferably as quickly as possible because the bottom can and will fall out. See the current status of Salesforce development for example.\n\nContrast that to a generalist who gets paid less to start, but eventually they know so much there isn't really anything they can't do.

Specialization can be added on top to fit into desirable roles after.\n\nThe problem I see with a lot of specialist engineers, even mid-to-late career, is that they can end up being sidelined when things go wrong.\n\nLike a superstar front-end engineer who can crush React components, handle bundling and build systems and even has solid chops putting together a build system and deployment pipeline. But they might end up flummoxed when the site is broken due to bad DNS config, load balancer problems, certificate issues, etc.\n\nSpecialists can be super productive when they are in their lane and things are working on the happy path. But they can end up struggling  when troubleshooting failures and problems that occur in systems they \"own\" but fall outside their speciality.\n\nI'm happy that I've spent time working on provisioning systems for bare metal servers, fumbled my way through setting up networks and getting BGP working across VPN links between sites, built my own AD domains and a thousand other \"IT\" tasks which most Software Developers are never exposed to. Its been amazingly useful when it comes to troubleshooting failures and being able to identify all the places where problems can be injected into the environment where services run.\n\nSo ultimately, I think it is most valuable to be a specialist in one or more domains, but with a broad exposure and experience outside of those specialist silos. I think that means you pretty much need to be a generalist early in the career, then evolving specialist knowledge in one or more domains as your experience grows.",

On paper i was supposed to do 8 hours a day but it was so flexible that you could do your 40 hours hoever you liked. SO most would do 9 hour days M-Th and leave early friday. \n\nMy 2nd job was FAANG, I worked my ass off 50+ work hour weeks, etc. This was salary based. \n\nIn the USA, lunch is technically part of the law. But there are a lot of \\*wink-wink\\* in manager conversations. In the USA going home for lunch break is uncommon, nobody wants to stayt at work longer than they have to so most just eat at their desk and work and just do their 8 hours. Bosses will not be on your ass about that unless upper management says something. \n\nEspecially in the jobs with bad work culture there is a lot of \"we dont expect you to work more than 40 hours \\*wink-wink\\*\" or other statements like that. The problem is when one person starts working over 40, gets the praises and the more people do it. When one person doesnt want to do it, they get questions like \"well why are you so behind you co-workers?\". Even if you complete the work required in 40 hours, tehy will compare you to your co-workers not was is expected of you. I got bad reviews at FAANG because my coworkers were pulling 50-60 hours and had 50-60 hours worth of work where i had 40 hours worth of work.",

Here are a few thoughts (just from one dev’s 15+ yrs of messing around):\n\nYou did great figuring stuff out yourself. That takes grit, so don’t discount that.\n\nZero onboarding + teammates treating each other like competitors = big red flag for long-term team culture. If everyone’s solo, you’ll keep spinning your wheels.\n\nSince you love the tech and are learning, ask yourself: Is the **pay + tech** enough offset for the culture cost? If you burn out or slide into isolation, the pay won't feel good.\n\n**Try this:** pick a small target for change. Could be *\"Meet one teammate for coffee/virtual chat this week and ask what their blockers are.\"* Or *\"Offer to pair on one small task.\"* If you get zero response, that’s an indicator.\n\nKeep the radar up for your next move. You’re already coming from a team with good support... so you **know** what better feels like. That’s strength.\n\nIf it keeps feeling lonely and unsupported for 6-12 months, seriously weigh whether high pay + poor teamwork = “worth it” for you.\n\nBottom line: you’re not stuck forever. You’re learning, you’re doing good work. If this place starts to eat your joy or energy in a non-recoverable way, it’s valid to move on again.\n\nHope it gets better for you.",

If it’s a one off mistake, there’s odds he realizes he messed up here after this is all over.

If you own this - that’s on you. \n\nThis isn’t an “I’ll TRY and have this fixed…” type of thing. You’re a professional, in a professional job - you should have began this by having an attack plan with set deadlines. \n\nIngest the data and get the report could be step one. Step two find the problem and FIX it. Step three maybe do a thorough investigation to see if other data is being missed. Step four have a test suite or some way to monitor so this scenario doesn’t happen again. \n\nIf the urgent steps are not completed by noon on X day - you’re going to contact the manager or team lead and bring in help. You’re also actively communicating the status of these issues during standup / keeping your manager updated. \n\nAlso - if you know you’re doing dumb stuff then you need to stop and take a step back.

This gave those folks plenty of time to line up other jobs before they actually got let go. I really respected that company for that.\n\nBut if you mean actually laid off, the answer's the opposite. I want that to happen as late as possible. I want to be collecting an income for as long as possible.

If you’re having trouble finding another job, but you have the flexibility in your current position, starting looking into creating bigger projects for yourself. You can either discuss this with your team or manager or you can look into any other tools/integrations that you can introduce to help boost your company’s business.

As you scale you gain more leverage to incentivize companies/clients to implement their own pre-processing (or provide as a paid service) to gain access to your tool.

Nobody loans someone money thinking \"This person sucks, pretty sure they're gonna fuck me\".\n\nThere's 2 very different questions baked into your post. One is how to bill yourself. The other, and one you're neglecting, is doing business with family/friends.\n\nGo ahead. Google what doing business with family/friends is like. No matter how good my sister's tech idea might be, in no world would I ever consider working for her. Same for my friends. My friends are very smart, they have lots of good ideas. But we're friends. Not co-workers. That's why I'll never in a million years do *any* sort of work for them.\n\nIt's very well established that you should never do business with friends/family. And if you do, you should do so expecting to never be paid. You're working for free. If you expect to be paid, you should not do the work.\n\nFor the other side of the question, you mention you have an aversion to an hourly wage..... why? There's a reason that's what a lot of freelancers do. There's lots of hidden costs you don't think of that can pop up during a project. It's really tough to just say \"Yeah, just pay me $X\". If any of a million things come up, $X suddenly turns into $X+$10k. Now you're out a bunch of money because you tried to do an upfront cost versus an hourly rate.\n\nAs for the actual rate, a lot of SWE's tend to charge $50-100 per hour.",

He probably solved that problem countless of times before so it's straightforward to him. If he has been working for the company a long time, he is also much more comfortable with the codebase than you, naturally.  You will get there eventually, don't stress out about it.\n\nI don't think you should log in during your PTO or work every weekend. That's a sure way to burn out, and your performance and focus will get even worse. Do other things, have fun, refresh, have hobbies.\n\nAlso, maybe the stories that you get assigned are hard for your current level. A lot of companies don't even want junior developers, and don't know the appropriate level of tasks that they should give them.\n\nIf you are always given tasks above your level, then you will always feel like you are not enough. It's all relative.\n\nMy only advice would be to ask more questions and ask for help earlier in the task and not wait until the end. If you are unsure about how to do something, ask for advice or \"how to do it well\" or \"the best practices\" for such task. When you want to discuss your task with your senior, study your task very well, understand the code you wrote, and **TAKE NOTES**. \n\nDon't try to remember everything in your head if you can't. I always brought my notebook during meetings when I had to talk about my tasks and code and referred to it when needed.\n\nGood luck",

I thought that was hard, but it was actually quite easy compared to working within a properly organized tech company.\n\nFirst 6 months at my current tech job were absolute hell. I could not get anything done on time. All of my PRs would get torn to pieces in review. I caused a handful of significant issues in prod. I spent every single day worrying about getting fired. A few of my more complicated projects brought me to tears.\n\nEveryone I work with has like 7+ years of experience. I feel like a fucking worm compared to my teammates. Just like you said, they can do in an hour what I can't do in five. I can't even comprehend how people can work at that speed.\n\nHere's where our stories diverge, though:\n\nMy manager has consistently (like at least once a month) reminded me that I am doing an awesome job. They have reminded me that it's normal for me to be slower than my teammates, it's normal for me to struggle or have knowledge gaps, and it's normal for me to ask for help. My work is valued by the company even if it isn't as impressive as the work being done by industry veteran wizards.\n\n>“I don’t even know how to help you.”\n\nThat's your \"Team Lead\"? Their job is literally to know how to lead you. They are admitting that they are bad at their job. This is like the absolute worst thing you could say to a junior 6 months into their first dev role.\n\nYou should not take what this person said to heart. Maybe you *do* suck at the tasks you're being assigned, but that might just mean your lead sucks at assigning you appropriate tasks.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you're incompetent, but it also doesn't sound like you have imposter syndrome. It just sounds like you have a shitty boss that isn't facilitating or recognizing your growth.\n\nI would just keep your head down, do your work, and shrug off the shitty attitude from your boss. This early on, you should just take things one day at a time. Rack up a couple years of experience and then start exploring better opportunities.",

Keep your head down and address everything the pip wants you to do in case you cannot find a job in time. Don't complain, do what they ask and document everything. Even if you survive the pip maybe consider finding a new job anyway; several things you mentioned in here make this place sound terrible.\n\nThis comment is especially concerning:\n>I'm the only guy on my team\n\nI assume you mean you are either a one man team or the only developer. Having no collaboration or mentorship is really bad for your career\n\nI have seen folks finish pips successfully and not get fired, but unfortunately they also were first in line to get laid off\n\nSincerely good luck. It's tough out there and I wish you the best",

When new roles are available they make that list available to all those agencies. At that point its a scramble to contact anyone who fits the JD. So if its a recruiter that's been in the game for a while, they have a bunch of candidates they've contacted before, or they already know where to look\n\nIf its someone who sounds a bit new, they send that initial contact msg and if you aren't responsive thats when they keep pressing\n\nSo not sure if you've noticed but sometimes you'll get hit up by different agencies where the JD is eerily similar if not identical minus the usual text replacements. It's because it is in fact, the same role for the same company\n\nIn either case, if you don't get any response, some other candidate likely already bit, and they've submitted them for the role (obvi they can submit multiple candidates) but you can see that you've got a better chance the sooner you respond to their initial contact. Maybe you did, but maybe there were also 10 others and they chose to go with candidates that gave them (the recruiter) better chances for selection\n\nI've mentioned this several times before with regards to recruiters - we're just race horses. If you show promise, they give you all the attention, because they're betting all their money that you get selected for the interview process and hopefully all the way to an offer.\n\nIf you're behind, or lacking, that's when you get ghosted. They might even come back to you when a different role becomes available, because they remembered you replied the last time. You just gotta be quick, and cross your fingers",

It's tough. And some people can be very condescending and difficult to work with. \nI found a new job in the country I currently live in for this very reason and I will give my resignation very soon. \n\nJust remember, we are always being held to higher standards when it comes to technical skills. Because their assumption is that we are just not as technical as them. They don't do it consciously and if you mention it to them as a feedback to your manager they will 100% get defensive and you will come across as \"oversensitive and blaming them for sexism instead of responding positively to their feedback\". \nBut it's been my experience, my friends' experience and I ve seen it countless times.\nThere have been times that I saw men in my team doing things in a certain way and their PRs got merged. I tried to use their approach and my PR got scrutinized. \nI try to just stay on the facts, avoid making any accusations, just sharing code snippets and say \" we used this approach here, how is it different now?\". Most of the time, they don't have an answer.\n\nJust try to look at your output objectively. Are they really right to what they are saying? If not, try to remind yourself that your output is just being scrutinized much more than theirs. If yes, try to improve on the things they are right and also document what you worked on/what you did to improve. \n\nI also found that these issues significantly reduce when I work in teams with a more balanced gender ratios. My current experience at this job, has been really extreme and it makes sense since I am literally the only woman in a team of 15+ people.\n\nI wish you good luck! ❤️",

You got a CS degree and that is a testament to your knowledge and ability to learn and grow in this field.\n\nI don’t know what companies are looking for with respect to new grads these days. It used to be the case that companies hired knowing you had zero experience but the capacity to learn and grow into the role. These days, since there’s so many new grad applicants, the bar for hiring has been raised and so you’ll need to improve your resume to get interviews and improve your interview skills to increase the odds of performing well.\n\nThink of it as levels in a game, you'll want to focus your energy on one level at a time (more or less). Since you're not landing interviews, this the first level to pass. Get constant feedback on your resume. You should be iterating on it — share it with friends or redditors to get feedback, make improvements, and send it out to companies (job boards, networking, etc). If you get callbacks, this means your resume is good enough. If not, keep doing that iterative feedback loop until you do. \n\nOnce you feel you're landing interviews a bit more consistently, then you'll need to focus on the interview rounds. I don't really know what that entails for new grads, but you seem to be on the right track. Practicing leetcode as a way to prove your understanding of DSA is good. Working on personal projects is also good. Keep track of what problems you encounter and what you did to solve them, and be able to communicate that. They don't expect you to be an expert, just want to know how you think and tackle problems. It's great that you're focusing on infra and LLM projects btw. There's no right or wrong path here, the field is too broad so it's best to do what you're interested in because enjoyment is a crucial recipe for making progress and preventing burnout. It's better to have some depth here rather than shallow breadth. \n\nIt really sucks that this is the market you’re graduating into, but you’re definitely not a fraud, and you're definitely not alone in this experience. Do what you need to sustain a living and be sure to socialize, exercise, and eat well to keep your mental health in good shape too! Good luck.",

Not all companies have a good onboarding/ramp-up time for you, but that's not something you can control anyway. \n\n  \nOnce you get there, find out what you need to know for your team's projects and tech stack. Go from there.\n\nI didn't have AI to help me when I started, but I think AI makes it way easier to learn quickly nowadays. Use it to understand the code base. Like if you need to modify a part of something in the codebase, use AI to find where the code is and understand what patterns this codebase use and get suggestions.\n\nNeed to build something from scratch? Use AI to quickly understand parts of the tech stack you don't understand. Feed it documentation and ask questions. Clarify your understanding, but be skeptical about what it tells you. ask it to confirm, ask it for direct reference sin the documentation if you're unsure.\n\nI don't really know what's best for a junior in this era of AI-assisted tools. But my personal opinion is that you use it to augment your learning potential and gain experience. Once you have more experience, perhaps you can use it to vibe code or output tons of code.

        "body": "The problem with academic programming in school is that business has an entirely different set of needs, tools and development processes. As a junior-level person, you're not expected to know all that stuff. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule -- startups frequently expect new grads to know as much and be able to perform at the level a senior with full implementation level knowledge of their tech stack in the first week. FAANGs might also have higher expectations and be more unforgiving as well, depending on the FAANG.\n\n\nLarger corporations that aren't FAANG will generally have well established IT groups who can offer a decent level of mentorship. Maybe focus on trying to find a spot at one of those.\n\n\nThe more you know in general the better. Being able to set up docker instances and CI/CD pipelines is a pretty good skill to have, even if you don't find devops particularly interesting. You might even want to go look at hashicorp's terraform and tools like that, that allow you to stand up a huge amount of infrastructure with the wave of a hand. I don't particularly care for terraform's configuration, would much rather do it in python, but it's still a pretty neat tool and a good one to have in your toolbox. You are very much building out a toolbox now, and it's good to know the things you have at your disposal.\n\n\nI wouldn't suggest coding directly with AI. There are a couple reasons for that and your instincts are good that if you just blindly copy and paste AI code, you're not really going to learn anything. Poke at the problem a bit and use the AI for inspiration. If it writes code for you, try to read and understand it and possibly even rearrange it a bit. Rather than \"Write some code to do X\", focus on \"How do I do X\" and try to understand the underlying concepts.\n\n\nAlso, relax! Back in the 80's when I was getting started, there was already way more to know about this field than any single person could know. Math has been like that since Isaac Newton's day -- before him, one single person could know everything there was to know about math. He gave us the map to an infinite landscape. Programming is similar, an infinite landscape of the mind. Don't try to understand it all at once and accept that there will be things you couldn't have even imagined were out there. Maybe you'll even invent one of them one day!\n\n\nGot a couple of funny stories for you if you care to keep reading.\n\n\nFunny story about relaxing: I decided to learn how to skydive when I was in my early 40's. My instructors kept telling me to relax. And I was all like \"I'M ABOUT TO JUMP OUT OF AN AIRPLANE! I AM NOT GOING TO RELAX!\" A few months later I went to the indoor skydiving wind tunnel and told my instructor I just wanted to mess around today and not focus on learning anything. As soon as I hit the wind I felt my whole body relax and I realized that *I'd never done that before!* And I flew so well that day. And knowing how to relax, my driving (which I'd been doing for ~30 years at that point) immediately improved as well. It took a somewhat extreme experience to get me to that point, and it's something I wish I'd learned much earlier in my life.\n\n\nFunny story about people skills: Empathy is a human superpower. We have the ability to think about what another person might be thinking and feeling and act on how we think they're feeling. Hone that power to a fine edge and it's as close to telepathy as we're gonna get. At some point along the way, I found that while reading code, I could get a sense of how well the programmer who wrote it understood the requirements and even their mood and how they were feeling when they wrote the code. It's weird when it happens.\n\n\nSo back in the poker craze of the early 2000s there were a bunch of guys around who'd go to bars and set up tables to run free poker tournaments. They'd arrange to get a small kickback from the bar for each customer they brought in. I got laid off from a company I was working for at the time so I started frequenting these tournaments, as they were free to enter and usually offered a free $30 bar tab to the winner of the tournament. I could pick up one or two of those a week and get one or two halfway decent meals out of them. Playing poker taught me to look at people. I can't read people as well as I can read code, but the first time I knew what a guy's hand was just from watching him while he was thinking about betting, I felt like a sorcerer.\n\n\nSo learn what you can about computers, but also learn what you can about yourself and the species you belong to. You'll find some surprising things there too, I think.",

They seemed to think that generating commentary was the objective in itself, rather than someone taking responsibility for solving a problem.\n\nJust to illustrate the ridiculousness of this - there was one instance where a level 6 proposed a design, level 6s reviewed and approved and delivered the design, and then I talked to them 2 times about how the delivered solution did not address the problem that it needed to be used for. And then I was assigned to use their solution, their un-modified solution failed to actually solve the problem I needed it to solve, and I did my best to deliver my part of the project and then resigned in contempt for the leadership of my team. \n\nAnd in my engienering handoff meeting, as I was resigning, after my project had been impacted by this deficit in their design, I mentioned again that it was not fit for the purpose it needed to be used for. One of the level 6 reviewers just said \"This was not identified as a requirement.\" And that was it. Life goes on, they just didn't have to take any responsibility for failing to deliver something which solved a problem and engaging in denialism for months.\n\nAnyway, I suggest you ask these people plainly if their commentary is contributing to someone taking responsibility for solving a problem, or if they are generating commentary for some other objective, and figure out whether their commentary is making measurable progress toward that objective. They will probably say that they are trying to contribute valuable implementation details on *how* to solve the problem, so you should be ready to ask if they are sure that their comments are commensurate with the prioritization of problems that we have; because it might be that commissioning a smaller group to solve the problem is a lot more effective than sitting as a group talking about details that are germane only to a subset of people.",

Jusk for clarification, if your colleagues aren't dickheads, then they will be fine with a non-native speaker asking for clarification, do that enough and hopefully they learn to be more concise too.\n\nAlso some people also just love to hear themselves talk, also some people have work as their whole identity so you may be some of the most exciting social interaction these people get all week.",

It's not going to wipe out coding, but it can help one developer move far faster in many tasks, so it will increase productivity and we'd all be smart to learn how to use it and how not to. Like don't copy and paste its code as it makes mistakes a lot, preferably don't use it to write code at all unless it's boilerplate that you are just sick of writing each time (unit tests for example), it's patterns aren't always correct and if you use it to write code, then that code doesn't work, good luck. But do ask it for things that are unchanging, like design patterns, DSA, common established patterns for popular frameworks, etc. Use it like you would a senior at work, you don't have them do your work for you, you ask them for help and, hopefully, they point you in the right direction.",

By developing it yourself, you've just demonstrated to everyone that no one really needs them to develop internal apps. In the future, I'd consider bringing one of them early in and showing them early prototypes - if you want to be more strategic about it and know what they like/don't like, you can create decoy features which you know they will insist on removing, just so that they have an illusion of power they can use.\n\nWhat I'd do now?\n\n\\- You can detach yourself emotionally from this by finding an external point of reference in respect to the changes they insist on. For example, instead of saying \"We need native notifications because this is how the system works, and everyone else does it this way\", say - \"If we go this route, we'll have to maintain a home-grown notification system. This will incur an ongoing maintenance cost, and it may be difficult to go back on this decision if we run out of resources\". It helps if you bring up these points with your manager before you speak to them. Tell your manager that you've thought this through and what really matters here is that we ship something the users want, and ship it relatively quickly.  \n\\- Show the prototype to users and use their opinion as an anchor point when having discussions. If there's an outcome you don't like, find a relevant data point to support your claim and point them to it. Create a perception that you don't really care either way, but it seems that this is what the users want.  \n\\- If you can, roll it out to some beta testers and gather feedback to strenghten the above point.  \n\\- If you can provide numeric data to support your claims, that will have a much stronger effect than anything above - if you can say 9 out of 10 users want regular sized widgets, then there's not much to talk about.  \n\\- Speak with your manager and try to get him to buy into the following narrative: \"we've already spent so much time on this, our users need this ASAP, they love the design, so let's just roll it out and spend the remainder of the time on this project adjusting it to their liking\".\n\nIt's important to create a perception of being detached emotionally from it, this will bring their guard down.",

No I'm so glad you were able to take the time in between your expert UI design to educate me on the options I have for scheduling notifications. I can't believe I didn't already explore it and 3 other potential options discarding them all for various reasons.\n\nThis is far from my first rodeo I'm well versed in the art of spinning things to sell them to people this is just the first in almost 30 years of working professionally that I've had a group this petulant and stubborn about the aesthetics over literally everything else.\n\nAs for my manager helping that would have been nice but I'm at least glad I know now he never had my back and never will so I can plan and work accordingly.",

Don't expect your current job to get better.\n\nIf you don't mind getting fired, you can start pushing back and calling them out when they're stupid.  I usually avoid confrontation, and would just quietly start working for a new job.\n\nFor example, at one job, someone started yelling at me over the phone because the website was down for an hour.  I just hung up on him.  Surprisingly, everyone knew he was an asshole and nobody else complained.\n\nThe other is to just do your best to humor them, try and meet their crazy demands.  This isn't sustainable for a long period of time.  I'd only do this if I knew I wouldn't have to work with them again after the project was over.",
