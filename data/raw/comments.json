The disconnect between real-world engineering and these artificial puzzle questions is frustrating. What helped me was changing my practice approach - instead of trying to solve a ton of problems, I focused on deeply understanding a smaller set of core patterns and writing them from scratch repeatedly until the syntax became muscle memory. I also started narrating my thought process out loud during practice to get comfortable talking through my approach. Have you tried platforms like interview query? They have some DE-specific practice problems that are more relevant than generic LeetCode, plus they offer peer mock interviews where you can practice the communication part. Sometimes just getting comfortable with the interview format is half the battle. Don't beat yourself up - these interviews are rarely representative of the actual job!",

You have to learn to speak the language they speak.\n\nIn the future I'd try to give more options during interviews to the interviewers on how they want to proceed. If they want to see a project you are familiar with, pull up your notes. If they want to focus on your experience with their tools, follow up with clarifying questions about your scope and then propose a solution -- or even just relate how your experience applies to solving that particular problem.\n\nHope that helps some.

More chances than not, you will not have spaces to develop something ground breaking, but rather tweaks on existing code or some fixes. \n\nI think one of the keys of professional success is learning to make lemonade with the lemons you're given, and it applies specially to feeling stuck. Most of the times, people that break through are people who learned something new, a new trick, or those who trained themselves on their own time, to learn to cook with better ingredients.\n\nIt seems to me your best bet would be finding a healthy work place, and then finding self projects. A lot of times you really need to dig deep into what you want to learn, find the path to get there, and walk every step along the way.\n\nIn other words, it often comes down to never beating yourself up. Instead, it might be from knowing yourself well enough to HAVE to learn on your own pace and with less pressure. My impression is that the pressure comes mostly from being forced to do things on the job that you're not that familiar with. \n\nFinding a solid ground comes from finding a place that will take you as you are, give fair compensation, and you show your true self and what you know. It never does well to try and be something/someone you aren't, force it, and set yourself to crash and burn.",

QA should be similar to PROD.\n\n2. Have automated load tests to know breaking points.\n\n3. Good observability similar to services with proactive monitoring.\n\n4. Good data contracts (you already have them).\n\n5. Repeatable fixed size workloads through out the pipeline (you can have a generic splitter component that you can hook to any of your stages to ensure that any component always gets regulated input).\n\nHonestly the problems that you highlighted light up my eyes, DEs are excited to solve these problems :)\n\nAll the best!",

You can do it via a technical path, a management path, etc. Almost all ways of moving up will move you farther and farther away from day to day coding. In order to be considered for these type of positions, you need to start developing skills for them. Most of them don't come naturally and are often hard for people who are really into the weeds.\n\nWant to move up to an architect? Architects only code enough to prove out concepts and ideas that will work on a design. When I have had people come up to me to ask about becoming an architect, the first question to them is, \"Are you ready to give up coding?\" Not because they won't have to, but I am looking to see if their head is in a space for the next steps. Architects have one foot in the business world and one in the tech world. The two worlds are very, very different.\n\nHone your people skills. No matter how you move up, you will need them and they can always be better. You will have to start listening for business requirements (both stated and implied) and figure out not only what they are saying but the right patterns to pass down for the coders to implement. It is hard because the sirens in the weeds will always be there calling you back. You have to fight them. Every time you think, \"I could do this faster myself\" you need to STOP. \n\nNext level up is changing your tools. Your tools are no longer software on hardware but the software inside people's head. You need to learn how to communicate what you want done to other people. Unlike the hardware you are used to, sometimes you may need to do it multiple times to get what you want. You also have to make your people (tools) better. I think that is an obligations more senior people have to the newer ones. The trick is how to do it without being a dick.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.",

When you graduate, who knows? \n\nThe story I always retell is when I went to university, pharmacists were in huge demand in the UK.  So much that universities were desperate to jump on the bandwagon, start up a pharmacy course, and have their first cohort graduate so they can gain accreditation.  About 5-6 years later after I went to university (a few years after I graduated), the requirement for pharmacists steeply declined.\n\nOpposite story: when I was trying to become a DE, I watched a video from a popular YouTuber who described DEs as \"second class citizens\" and \"SQL monkeys\" in the data space.  I chose to not listen to that person and carried on anyway because I really enjoyed DE.  In the following 3-6 months after began the massive boom of data engineering and I got lucky.\n\nWe can't predict the future.  We can only pursue what we're interested in and adapt when the time comes.",

There is also just much more of a cookie cutter nature to analyst work than DE, which is where LLMs excel. Asking ChatGPT to make you a streamlit dashboard with some “insights” on a dataset, vs asking it to solve complex Spark efficiency issues, you can see the difference already today. My instinct is that AI will enable DEs to plug informative BI modules onto their pipelines far faster than it’ll enable analysts to stand up and maintain large data infrastructures on their own.",

Many services, cloud providers, and other stacks will work natively with open formats in a DL/DLH. So you can always leverage or pivot different technologies.

The small number of engineers could not keep up with the volume and variety of requests so the analytics team bought a BI solution that allowed them to maintain their own models (Looker in this case). Based on your definition this was a ‘Shift Right’. \n\nThe analytics team operated for years without dedicated people to ensure their environment was well organized or resilient to new business processes that require the logic that was locked in that transformation layer.\n\nWhen I took over that position we started to migrate logic out of Looker and into DBT, a process we are still working through today. \n\nThe pilot project here was to deal with a deviation of a legacy data model in our data engineering environment by cleaning up and replacing it with all the goodies our analytics team extended and prepared in Looker for years. Once the legacy model was replaced we also made sure everything was set to refer to the new models.\n\nWe are not moving away from having analysts model in Looker/LookML, though we have also set them up with DBT Cloud. Instead we are treating that workflow more like prototyping. Once our analysts have iteratively refined those models and they are stable we find the best way to ‘Shift them to the Left’. Sometimes these prototypes are abandoned by the business or analysts. This is fine, we didn’t put any additional engineering resources into it.",

        "body": "It's ok to write lots of files to open table formats like iceberg *up to a point*, and as long as you're doing blind inserts.\n\nThe append-only blind-inserts are part of the purpose of a bronze layer. By appending everything you receive without reference to what is already in the table at the time you insert it you can have multiple writers all writing at the same time without conflict. If you start doing merge operations or `where not exists` on the target table then you can start getting write conflicts.\n\nHaving lots of small files is an issue when you're reading the data back, as it takes longer and longer to make all the individual API calls to grab each object. That can be handled by periodically doing a compaction on the files. A compaction can be run at the same time as blind inserts -- they don't conflict with each other.\n\nBut this is all fine on a scale up to writing every second or so. If you're *constantly* making tiny writes and inserts then you're crossing more into streaming territory. If you can receive your data through a stream (or queue) then you can buffer up writes for a while then bulk write them to iceberg. AWS Data Firehose and Azure Event Hubs can do some of this for you automatically - each has a capability to automatically write all streamed data out to data files every time a buffer threshold is reached (up to ~15 minutes / ~300MB, whichever is first). If you don't need ultra-low latency queries, then these can work, and generally if you're working off of some open table format your queries have a certain minimum latency anyway.\n\n---\n\nThe post you read may be talking about something like [Databricks autoloader](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ingestion/cloud-object-storage/auto-loader/). If anything else automatically does this for you it will have to be part of the execution & orchestration engine that you're working on. It *needs* some kind of eventing system and metadata-storing db to track everything. Iceberg is just a table format spec, not an ingestion engine of its own.\n\nWhatever it is it will basically be catching blob triggers and writing their data into a managed low latency db, then periodically grabbing any unprocessed files and batch loading them. It isn't super difficult to roll your own, but there's a few components and you'll have to reason things out yourself around managing the state for un/processed file metadata.",

        "body": "> I find a developer easier and if I find him he most probably knows a lot about modelling\n\nOnly applies to some organisations. I've been in some where everyone come up through a more traditional analyst pathway on SQL databases, and they had absolutely no concept version control, or version control, or literally anything other than SQL. Sure, you can find these people and grab them if that's all you need.\n\nOther organisations however may be more oriented around their own internal technology, and may have more SWE around the place. In that case finding developers that can work in something like Python will be a lot easier, and they'll be a lot more used to writing code that can be run and tested locally, and they'll be more familiar with all of the tooling around all of that and they'll prefer it -- they will be aggravated by the limitations of having to only work on a remote db and not having debugging tools.\n\nSo this is just about matching up with the type of organisation you're in.\n\n>  I dont care about scaling because the scaling part is taken over by...\n\nNot relevant to a decision between dataframe libraries and SQL. Scaling is handled by the execution platform and is entirely independent of the data transformation and querying code you've written.\n\n>  I don't care about dependency hell because there are no version changes.\n\nThis also isn't really about dataframe libraries vs sql.\n\nSQL databases do go through version changes and they can change behaviour or syntax and that can break things. As an individual pipeline or procedure writer you might not see that much if you've been relying on a DBA or an ops team to handle all of that for you, or if databases aren't upgraded for years you just may have not have gone through such a process. I have been at an org that spent about a year and a few million dollars desperately trying to update their all their SQL to work on the new DW because it worked *slightly* differently and randomly broke all sorts of things.\n\nIf you get things working and just stick with a version, you're not going to get dependency hell regardless, because your dependencies aren't changing. Even if you are updating... I can't recall ever having any data issues due to version updates.\n\nAll software gets updated over time. All changes can potentially break things. You can have frequent changes and small easily fixed issues, or rare big changes that are horrendously painful. These are platform considerations, so they don't directly relate to whether you're using dataframes or sql.\n\n> It is quite general and I don't face problems with migrating to another rdms.\n\nFor the most basic of select statements, sure, you can usually copy+paste things over. For actual pipelines and management though, you're often going to have to change syntax around to fit with whatever server you're running on.\n\n* T-SQL uses `TOP` after `SELECT` but other dialects use `LIMIT` at the end\n* QUALIFY exists in some dialects but not others\n* Does your DDL have `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` or only `SELECT INTO`\n* What options do you have for tables in your DDL -- they are often quite different\n* Some RDBMS allow partition exchanges, but they don't all work the same way\n* Some servers allow `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS` while others require you check first.\n* Some servers allow `CREATE OR REPLACE` while others require you `DROP` then `CREATE`\n* Some dialects have ANTI and SEMI joins, others require you to implement in a subquery\n\nIf you completely swap your dataframe libraries around you'll have to go through a similar process of finding equivalents. Or you could just not - if your pipelines run on their own host then each pipeline can use a different library, allowing you to gradually migrate from one to another. It isn't like when you have a single SQL database you're running on, and when you want to switch you have to move *everything*.\n\n> In most cases it look's cleaner to me than f.e. snowpark\n\nYou're just used to it (though I can't speak to snowpark specifically). Personally *I* find that the composability of dataframes and transformer functions allows me to better encapsulate certain behaviours and abstract them away. It allows me to run partial transformations rather than having to faff around with reworking subqueries or CTEs, and I don't have to scroll up and down massively long queries even for what ends up being a large and complex transformation.\n\n> The development roundtrip is super fast.\n\nYou're probably just more used to it. What even is the 'roundtrip' to you? What are the development, test, and deployment cycles you're looking at using?\n\n> Problems like scd and cdc are already solved million times\n\nAnd they have the same approaches in dataframes. You're still doing the same operations, you're just expressing them differently.\n\n---\n\n> Unittests are easier\n\nThis is significantly underselling it. By integrating the dataframe library into your imperative language, like Python, you can generate synthetic data during the script. Your transformations can be expressed as functions, which means you don't even need to load data into any kind of locally-run database, you can just inject data directly into the transformation function to check for the result. You can do this interactively when developing, chaining your own custom data directly into the functions that you are testing. Everything you write here can then by turned into an automated test.\n\n---\n\nThe biggest aspect you are missing is that dataframes are integrated into another programming language, which allows your pipelines and processes to be much more dynamic and much more capable.\n\nFor example, I can write a function that takes a dataframe and a list of key columns and it will automatically generate a column expression to generate a hashdiff. I don't have to list out the data columns every single time, it can inspect the dataframe schema and figure that out without running any actual transformations.\n\nI could have a function that looks at a struct column and automatically comes up with the column expression that will flatten it out. It can automatically do this recursively as well, making it very easy to flatten out ingested json data.\n\nI can write a UDF that can make use of *anything* in my programming language and return the result data back to the execution engine.\n\nDuring a long line of transformation steps I can inspect the data as it goes to change behaviour, including conditionally sending messages or alerts out. I don't have to wait for the end of a procedure to collect a result, I don't need another system to query some logging table to poll for results.\n\nI can make use of the fact that the programming language will have an LSP in my IDE to allow me to jump between transformer functions. Every time I see some abstracted behaviour and want to know how it works, I press a single key and jump directly to that code. If I want to rename something in my logic it is a single keypress and typing the new name, and that variable reference is renamed everywhere without error.\n\nWhen building complex transformations I can handle what would otherwise be complex subqueries or CTEs by chaining a single function call. I don't have to re-nest the previous statement in their own `SELECT` statements, I just take the existing dataframe and chain another `.select()` off of it.\n\nOverall this gives you more flexibility and expressiveness, but requires a slightly more complex approach. That tradeoff isn't necessarily for everyone, but it doesn't make one option absolutely better or worse than the other, it just depends on what you *want*.\n\n---\n\nAs others have mentioned, they're not inherently exclusive. While using an RDBMS as your execution engine may prevent effective use of dataframes, using a dataframe-based execution engine you can also write SQL. Spark allows you to swap back and forth between SQL and dataframes (https://spark.apache.org/sql/) ; [Polars can also do it](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/dev/reference/expressions/api/polars.sql.html) ; and [Daft is bringing it in too](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/sql/overview/#example)",

But the short version is integers can be stored on disk in 1 to N bytes even if they require up to N bytes. Smaller values don't require the full space. That is not the case for a UUID/Blob data so they will always use the 16 bytes allocated to them when stored on disk even if they do in memory. \n\n\n https://sqlite.org/fileformat2.html#varint\n\n\nTL:DR numbers are smaller than UUIDs on disk when you change to UUID small numbers take up more space. \n\n\n> Any tips on reducing that overhead while still using UUIDs?\n\n\nFirst suggestion. Don't worry about it for 600MB unless this genuinely matters. *IF* It genuinely is worth the effort. Try splitting the UUID into two 16 bit numbers and decode the UUID into two 16 bit numbers and re-render as a UUID on the way back out. ",

No more migrations, no manual backfills, no fragile one-off scripts, no emergency data recovery jobs, no writing painful ETL pipelines just to restructure your data — you simply reshape your models and press replay.

We worked with a Faroese company information platform that pushed all their raw events into Flowcore — and even though the events were pretty basic (like CRUD changes and updates), we were able to layer meaning on top during replay to build dedicated AI-optimized models. The result was that they now have an AI chat interface where users can ask super abstract questions, like *“Which municipality had the most new companies in 2024?”* or *“Tell me about this specific person and all the companies they’re involved in”* — and it just works. What’s cool is they didn’t need to rebuild their system, they just replayed their existing events into a new shape, and suddenly the AI could reason over the data properly.",

That allows us to do batch gets and puts with very little latency, and since it is all persisted to disk it is extremely durable and cost-efficient (don't need much RAM as opposed to Redis).\n\nThe great upside to this is you don't really need any specialized streaming platform to do it. We use Spark, but it could just as well be in Flink or really any flavor of service you'd like, even a simple Python lambda.",

Ease of Setup**\n\n. **Simple Deployment**\n\n* You can spin it up via Docker Compose or Helm charts for Kubernetes. Because there are fewer services involved, you typically get up and running faster.\n* Some companies with small DevOps teams have done production deployments in under a day.\n* **Collate’s Cloud Option**\n   * If you want zero infrastructure overhead (and a bunch of enterprise features), [Collate](https://www.getcollate.io/) provides a fully-managed OpenMetadata environment. There’s also a [free tier](https://cloud.getcollate.io/signup/) if you just want to try it out quickly.\n\n# 3. Is the Open Source Version Production-Ready?\n\n* **Absolutely**\n   * The open source release is self-sufficient, with features covering data catalog, lineage, governance, data quality, and collaboration.\n   * 1000s of organizations run it in production—some with small teams and others with hundreds of data users.\n* **Collate’s Enterprise Enhancements**\n   * Beyond simple hosting, Collate adds advanced automations, governance workflows, deeper data diff capabilities, and more (see [this comparison](https://www.getcollate.io/comparison) for a side-by-side feature breakdown).\n   * If you need enterprise-grade security, SSO/SAML, or advanced compliance features out of the box, Collate might be a good fit.\n\n#",

But we were skeptical if they can pull it off. However, the project has moved at a very high velocity, incorporating community feedback. Few things we like:  \n1. Last time I saw OM had 100+ releases in 3 years. Datahub over maybe over 8 years has 95 releases.  \n2. Datahub has just started adding native data quality support. Seems like it is not available in OSS. Datahub is behind OM in many important features.  \n3. We like collaboration features in OpenMetadata (activity feed, alerts, conversations, etc.) that are preserved/tracked around data. We were losing these in Slack threads.  \n4. Architectural simplicity. Not too many moving parts and no core dependency on Kafka. We could easily operationalize in our small infra team.  \n5. Community support on Slack is amazing. Some issues we reported were fixed immediately in the next release (our previous paid solution did not provide such support after paying a lot of money).  \n6. They have a sandbox that runs the latest release that we can play around with and give feedback.  \n7. APIs are very comprehensive and intuitive. We have built many custom workflows specific to our company for governance and data quality.\n\nThey also have an offering built around OpenMetadata with additional features. But for us, the OSS features are good enough.",

It sounds like you might be missing an orchestration layer though-I suppose Batch provides aspects of that, but take a look at Dagster or Airflow, and you can decouple compute from orchestration.",

It’s clearly a powerful tool, but since it’s not built for dynamic, runtime SQL generation, it becomes a bit trickier to apply in my case — especially with the dynamic grouping logic I’m working with.\n\nThe current system *does* work, but I’m starting to feel like it’s a bit too complex for its own good. As things scale, that complexity becomes harder to manage — and I’ve come to realise that **complexity at scale is unmanageable, while simplicity at scale is complex.**\n\nAppreciate the suggestion and open to any further thoughts you have!",

I started with Python doing the calculations, but it quickly became inefficient — so now, all the metric logic and maths is done within dynamically generated SQL.\n\nThe data is already cleaned and structured — but because this is connected to a dashboard, there’s a lot of real-time metric computation happening. Many of the values are derived from user-defined combinations (e.g. grouped by employee, campaign, workday, etc.), so **pre-aggregating and storing everything in the DB isn’t really viable**. We need to calculate many of these on the fly, based on how the user wants to view the data in that moment.",

That said i've been using Dagster since v0.14 or something around 4 years ago and watched it grow so by the time the enterprise version came around didnt feel like i was missing anything. \n\nOnly thing I'd do differently is to pick whatever tool im using for the job then orchestrate it with dagster not the other way round. Dont pick Dagster first then find tools to work with it. An example find yourself a good EL tool then see if theres Dagster integrations not limiting to yourself only to tools with Dagster integrations and missing out on good tools because they dont.  In my case i really wanted to try out SQL mesh but it doesnt work with Dagster and dbt does hence the dbt usage but SQL mesh had a lot of good benefits over dbt , same with SDF which has now been bought.",

You can achieve all of that with your own system especially if it is encrypted because as you noticed, you can't use autoloader out of the box for that.

The pricing is much more predictable ($0.50/GB + flat-rate connector pricing) which can be significantly more cost-effective at scale, especially compared to Fivetran’s new MAR-per-connector (what a mouthful) model or Hevo’s event-based model, which can become unpredictable if your upstream volumes spike as well.\n\n[Here’s](https://estuary.dev/etl-tools/estuary-vs-hevo/) a direct comparison we found helpful when evaluating.\n\nHappy to chat more if helpful!

Communicate with relevant stakeholders - First talk to your boss and explain the situation to see what he thinks. He may be able to direct you to people with more knowledge regarding the entire situation. You say you have databases, so someone is probably managing them and they would be a good place to start the conversation in terms of determining the low hanging fruit. It helps when all the data people are working with each other. Find out who is relevant and talk to them so you can potentially collaborate.\n\n2. Prioritize what is most important - Look at all those tasks you have in your backlog, rank them by how much value they would add, while keeping effort in mind. Create a 3 by 3 grid with priority/frequency on one axis (low, medium, high) and effort on another axis (low, medium, high). Your domain knowledge should allow you to quickly assess this. I would have a meeting with your boss and the other relevant people from bullet point 1. if possible. Ideally target the high priority ones first with focus on those perceivied to be the least effort.\n\nAfter this, the steps that are taken depend on what is important to tackle first: data integrity (deal with inconsistencies), data consolidation (centralize where data is located), data automation (automate a way to ingest files), data standardization (ensure data is in a constant format), etc. Just make sure you document anything and everything, it will eventually be a life saver down the line.\n\nI think you can start with learning high level concepts related to data governance as it will provide a solid foundation as to how to approach everything else.\n\nHope this helps, let me know if you got any questions.",

Don’t try to fix it later, just reject bad input.\n* No raw access - Don’t let people dump whatever they want into S3 or a DB. Build upload APIs or controlled ingestion tools with validation and clear error feedback (like \"invoice\\_date must be ISO-8601, not 'soon'\").\n* Alerting + dashboards - If bad data shows up, make it visible. Send Slack alerts, track source systems with the most rejections, build a \"wall of shame\". \n* Data contracts - This is getting more popular. You define what good data should look like (like no nulls in key columns, specific enums only ...), and you break the pipeline or alert when things go off the rails.\n\nHonestly though, I think a big part of the problem is social. You have to make the business care about why it matters - bad data = bad reporting = bad decisions. Similar to what u/Vhiet suggested. Once they see that, they’re usually more willing to work with you.\n\nIt’s not perfect, but this mix of tech + visibility + a little shame goes a long way.",

Often, quality depends on both the behaviour of users, the capabilities of the source system, master data architecture etc.\n\nIdeally, you would have some data contracts defined in relationship with the business side and use those data contracts to at least be able to report on data quality - or even enforce it (if quality is bad you may need to start with a softer approach).\n\n[https://data-contracts.com](https://data-contracts.com)\n\nI definitely think that management should be involved as this is a cross-organizational problem.

The value I bring is in things like understanding our end users' needs, or weighing the pros and cons of different possible approaches, or in making code that can be leveraged by other teams to accelerate not just my project but other similar projects as well. \n\nI do think you need to understand the code you wrote at a deep level, whether it not you use AI to write faster.

I am not defending AI and say succumb to it, but we must look at it at another perspective. It will all fall down to what the person does with it. Some people might feel helpless without it, some might not need it. But as long as we get things across and get job done without hurting others, why are we judging people who have different ways to do things? AI is not taking jobs, who do you thinking regulates AI now, who does research for AI to develop?

        "body": "Some hard-won advice on this topic:  \n\n1. Have a good working relationship with your manager. Build trust. This will ensure they _actually hear you_ when you ask to take on opportunities to push yourself. Pushing yourself without this trust can cause your manager to view you as self-sabotaging (causing delays, \"biting off more than they can chew\"), which makes everything harder.  \n2. Identify the developers on your team (or close to your team, this includes DevOps, architects, and even senior QA) who actually care about the quality of their work. Like someone else in this thread said, many people work in software simply because of the pay. Sometimes the \"this is just a job\" people are very talented engineers, but it's not as likely. When you find the people who really care, pair with them on your work, go to them with questions, etc.  \n3. Don't waste time, but ask questions when you can. In particular, if someone more experienced than you has work you can look at (e.g. in a pull request), and their implementation doesn't line up with how you would have approached the problem, ask them (politely/when it's convenient) to help you understand why they chose their approach vs your \"obvious\" approach. A major strength of more senior engineers is their ability to perceive/understand complicating factors, with nuance (see the last sentence in #4). A word of warning here... don't ask endless follow-up questions/don't get really in the weeds on every little thing. You run the risk of being seen as overly pedantic, nitpicking, or wasting time (for the pull request example, keep in mind that often the PR is only a final \"does this make sense to everyone?\" check before merging new code. So a developer might not appreciate having long conversations on every PR. For this reason, having a conversation or DMing them is often better than leaving a vague question as a PR comment).  \n4. Get involved in the design process as _early_ as possible. If you have the opportunity to sit-in on a meeting with an architect/dev lead while they design a new feature/project/service, _do it_. You won't be able to contribute (probably), and that is fine. But especially if these people are the ones you identified in #2, watching them work through a complex problem from the beginning will be a great learning experience. A big part of having engineering expertise is knowing what's important vs what is not important to the actual business requirement(s) (especially as it relates to the existing constraints of your application), not just knowing the ins and outs of your language/framework.  \n5. Talk to your coworkers about the work and build up your reputation as someone who cares. When you discover cool language features or software development practices, bring them up with people (\"I found this cool HN article the other day talking about <.NET feature>, do we use that here?\"). Then, when other devs are working on something new, they'll think \"I bet /u/Spiritual_Donkey_521 would love to hear about this.\" This can help get you exposed to parts of dev work you wouldn't normally encounter until later in your career.",

On NEON or AVX2, that can increase instruction count or inhibit pipelining when unrolled.\n\nAccuracy-first philosophy:\nFABE13 prioritizes clean, verifiable accuracy across the entire input range including when x < 0. So I chose the interval that minimizes approximation error as-is across ±x, not just positive x with tricks.\n\nYour idea is valid and likely faster in some cases. I may experiment with a [0, π/4] coefficient version as an optional fast-path especially for embedded or game engines where every cycle matters.\n\nThanks again,\nthis is exactly the kind of discussion I built FABE13 for ☺️",

Don't sacrifice your schooling for a potential job at a company that you know isn't going to treat you well anyway.

        "body": "Sorry to hear you're going thru this.  No, not all internships are like this.  The \"this is an easy task\" and other passive aggressive responses in particular are major indicators of a fairly toxic culture in that team and very likely the company.  That's not typical of most teams, but it's also not as rare as one might wish.  (And it is more common in teams that are hiring, because those teams have a higher turnover.)\n\nToxicity aside, the overall lack of guidance sounds like what happens when the hiring team is more swamped than they expected when they signed up to have interns.  The pattern of having to drop lower priority balls in a crunch is pretty normal, and it's likely \"intern support\" is one of those lower priority balls.\n\nIn that situation, an attitude of \"interns are both cheap and temporary, let's give them a non-essential nice-to-have and if they get it working, great, if not we'll sort it out later\" is the kind of strategy some people will run with if they have some interns they don't know what to do with.  Another possibility is they're attempting a sort of extended interview, where what they wanted wasn't so much to train people as to identify people with the tenacity to get it figured out, with an intent to make a job offer to those already at the \"swim\" level of capabilities (in a complete failure to understand (or probably even comprehend the possibility) that this is a side gig for you while you're mainly trying to graduate, rather than your sole full-time work focus like their jobs are).\n\nEither way, your best outcome here is to get it running more or less ok, get a good letter of recommendation, and find a different place for your next paid position.  (Tenacity, managing burnout, and finding alternative second-best outcomes under limited support and uncertainty of project success are all important skills in this field, but ideally you'd be sort of eased into them with some decent mentoring along the way, rather than left alone to maybe figure out your burnout damage or not. Also, burnout is a pretty well-studied phenomenon, and it will serve you well into the future if you read up on the literature, as another side project for an hour or 2/week.)\n\nFor getting your actual task figured out, there's a few decent options under the guidance they've (implicitly) given that they don't want their engineers to be bothered.  You're doing the right thing by posting in external forums, this approach can help with your technical questions too.  (Plus of course the web searching you're presumably doing about the error messages and unexpected behaviors you're seeing.)\n\nYou can also try finding a person or 2 in the company (edit: or outside the company) (but not your official team and not the point of contact telling you it should be easy) who you like their vibe, and just ask if they'd be available for an hour each week or so, and if they can, see if you can collect good questions they can help you get thru efficiently, or point you in their idea of the next step, for stuff you don't know what to do with.\n\nAlso a useful trick is to keep a slide deck open and capture screenshots of useful things to ask about.  Later you can trim it into a presentation or a walkthrough of issues you still have that you can show people easily.\n\nAnyway, good luck and remember that your most important goal in this arrangement is to impress someone enough they want to work with you and will write you a letter and/or be a good future contact in another job. Getting your \"easy\" project running is a decent means to that end, but you can also potentially achieve it by showing people the hurdles you did overcome on the way to not finishing.\n\n(Btw, most sane people doing actual backend work know that nothing in this space is as easy as it sounds, so the people telling you this are probably either lying to put pressure on you or not all that experienced themselves and mistaken about the difficulty of something they haven't attempted. Possibly they just forgot how they learned the things they know now and how hard it was, but probably they don't know how to do it either, and would take at least twice as long as their estimate.)",

Just my two cents:\n\nWhat is not ok \n\n* No onboarding structure: Being dropped into a codebase on day 4 with minimal context isn’t setting you up for success—it’s just irresponsible.\n* No dedicated mentor: Saying “this should be easy” to a new hire without offering guidance is lazy management. Interns and entry-level engineers usually need a few weeks to a few months to become productive contributors (reference: The Manager’s Path by Camille Fournier).\n* Poor leadership: The people supervising you either don’t know how to mentor—or they just don’t care to. That reflects poorly on them, not on you.\n   * If I were mentoring a second-year college student, I’d fully expect them to get stuck and need hands-on guidance at first. That’s normal. Once they’ve merged a few pull requests and built some confidence, then I’d start stepping back and letting them operate more independently. That’s how real growth happens.\n\nWhat you can do \n\n* Document everything: Keep track of what you tried, what went wrong, error logs, who you asked for help, what they said, etc. It shows initiative and covers you if anyone questions your effort. Learn as much as you can but do not stress over it after working hours.\n* Ask for clarification in writing Something like: *“Just to confirm, we’re expected to deploy a live service to EC2 using Docker and environment variables—is that correct?”* This can prompt a reality check or at least put expectations on the record. \n\nThis sounds like bad internship experience, and that’s OK. Internships are a two-way street: *they* are evaluating you, but *you* are also learning about them. If this is how this team treats interns, I wouldn’t want to work there full time. Don’t let their disorganization hurt your confidence. And like others said—prioritize school. That’ll outlast this internship.\n\nMany people have gone through rough starts and still gone on to build great careers. Doing your best in a poorly managed environment speaks volumes about your resilience. Try to take what you can from the experience, learn from it, and keep moving forward. One difficult internship or job won’t define your future—it’s just one chapter, not the whole story.",

For instance, a lot of bootcamp grads don't really understand how to get their code running on ANY web platform -- because they have no idea about filesystems, networking, dns, hosting.... none of it.  Then when you scale that up to the enterprise they have absolutely no idea about load balancers, replication, traffic shaping, etc.   While college grads aren't going to have hands on experience with these things, I've found that they generally have some foundational knowledge to \"how the internet works\" that I can anchor to. \n\nAnd unfortunately, this doesn't just apply to networking, but it's EVERYTHING.   Differences in file paths, text encoding, and general code portability that you see commonly aren't really taught in the \"build this project\" monorail of tutorials / bootcamps.  \n\n\n\nThe other thing that I see pretty commonly is a complete whiff on generics / abstractions / object polymorphism, for whatever reason a lot of folks don't understand that Type: Shape can contain be the parent to Triangle and Triangle extends shape....

Finally, you'll be surrounded by other students who are learning at the same time. You can help each other. You can compare notes.

Data structures and algorithms was at least okay. And really, O(n) notation isn't really that hard, complexity theory only gets nasty outside of the stuff you need for a day job. \n\nOn the other hand the big advantage of university lectures is the mathematicians mind-set of taking the entirety of a problem, reducing to its most fundamental equivalent form and then selecting from all possible solutions the ones with the desired properties. This is something that very few self-taught people can do, and real life project work also favours incrementally approaching a best-effort. But every once in a while you need to have a problem solved for every possible input, and then this is extremely valuable.\n\nAlso a big plus is a structured introduction to concepts that aren't easily explained or need prerequisite knowledge or even specialised hardware. Stuff like:\n\n- Hamming codes only really make sense if you think of them as maximally distant points in high dimensions\n- Wavelet compression needs Hilbert spaces as prerequisite\n- Cryptography is tons of esoteric mathematics\n- chip design, robotics, classical machine learning, applied computer graphics like MRI are all not really doable on a standard notebook\n- databases are about a lot more than SQL or normalised tables.

For example, Python doesn't natively have arrays. Instead, it has lists, which handle lots of things for you that you would have to do in other languages. It's good to have a knowledge of how these things work so you can better understand how to program in other languages as well, since Python won't work for all applications. \n\nYou shouldn't \"choose\" C++, you use the language that is best for your application, especially if you're doing personal projects. At my job, I've automated a ton of my daily work away, using exclusively Python, because it's so easy to do and simple to write, debug, and adapt to new situations. You're exactly right with your analogy of a hatchet vs an axe. There are a lot of people who will tell you that you need an axe, when in reality, you only need the hatchet. \n\nBut to answer your question, yes, Python is absolutely a real programming language, and no, it doesn't matter that it's simple. It just helps to have a little knowledge of what's really going on. Once you have a good grasp on the language, you should try branching out into a different language to learn a little bit more about programming. I personally learned Java after Python, then C++, then C (since I primarily work on microcontrollers now), and that really helped me understand what's going on, since C++ and C do not hold your hand at all. Java is easier to learn than C++, which is why I recommend it after Python. But you'll have a million people telling you what they think is the best way to do something. In reality, if you aren't doing this for work, then the best advice I can give you is just to have fun. This is a super enjoyable hobby and a great skill to have, but don't let someone suck the life out of it for you by telling you that there's one deterministic way to enjoy your programming journey. There isn't. Have fun, enjoy what you're doing, and the knowledge and skills will come ten times faster than if you were to force yourself to do something you don't want because of some stupid arbitrary rule that someone put forth.",

They don't do many for complex tricks because analyzing the number to see if the trick applies would take longer than just computing the answer.\n\nSo how fast can a modern processor \"grind everything out\" for something like an integer multiplication?\n\nThe important thing to understand is that it's hard-coded in circuitry. It doesn't have to execute a bunch of steps to multiply, one at a time - the circuits are right there in the chip and they parallelize as much as possible.\n\nThat said, multiplication is not instantaneous. On a modern processor you can expect it to take 3 - 5 clock cycles, whereas something like addition can be done in 1 clock cycle.\n\nSo, it is worth checking for some really easy tricks like multiplying by 1 or 0. Maybe multiplying by 2 even. Those checks are simple enough that the processor can detect them when decoding the instruction and shift it to another instruction, and that's exactly what's done.\n\nBut, there are a lot of \"tricks\" that humans use to save time that wouldn't make sense for computer processors, because they can just \"grind out\" the answer faster than checking it.\n\nIn general when you write code in a language like C or Python, the compiler/interpreter does some easy optimizations, and then your processor does some easy optimizations. Neither of them are likely to do tricky optimizations - they're usually just not worth the cost.\n\nThere are specialized mathematical programming environments, like Mathematica, where using number theory and other advanced tricks are possible.",

So if you add 01 and 01 you get 10, if you add 10 and 01 you get 11.  So you can look at this as a truth table.  For the first bit if you have:\n\n0 + 0 = 0  \n1 + 0 = 1  \n0 + 1 = 1  \n1 + 1 = 0 (with a carry)\n\nElectrically this is a xor circuit. If they are both 0 or 1 the first bit of the sum is 0, if the are different values then the first bit of the sum is 1.  Now for the second bit of the sum you have the logic:\n\nIf there is no carry from the first bit, xor the second bits.  If there is a carry then you now have the truth table:\n\n0 + 0 = 1  \n0 + 1 = 0 (with a carry)  \n1 + 0 = 0 (with a carry)  \n1 + 1 = 1 (with a carry)\n\nRemember that there is carry you have an additional 1 coming it.  This truth table is a xor and a not.  Now you can add in the logic for the 3rd bit and so on.\n\nYou might want to read: [https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb\\_7.html](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_7.html) which appears to give a good description of a binary adder.\n\nAs for shifting instead of multiplications all I can answer is probably not. This is because it would increase the time to do most of the multiplications, because now you have a first step of checking if only 1 bit is set on one of the numbers then do a shift, otherwise continue with the multiplication.  That check is only going to help rarely, and the check does take time.\n\nNow with a computer the compiler might notice that you are always multiplying a number by a constant like 16 and insert a shift instruction into the output rather than doing a multiplication.  But that means you are always multiplying some number not known at compile time by a constant that is a power of 2. Most compilers will actually do all the math it can during compile time so if you have it calculate x \\* (1 + 3) / 2 then the compiler might look at that say oh, you want really want to just multiple by 2, oh that is a power of 16, you just want to shift by one, rather than making the computer always add 1  + 3 multiple that by the input value then divide by 2.",

If you write const a = 10+20, the compiler will just make it const a = 30. Other tricks are loop unrolling (make a for loop into seperate statements if it's a known low number of iterations), and algebraic simplication.",

        "body": "Have you ever completed a course by yourself? The reason I ask is because there's a reason people go to university and major in computer science. This content isn't easy. Keep in mind, in the US, it takes 4 years to graduate with a CS degree.\n\nTo be fair, in the US, you have to take a bunch of other courses. Maybe 1/4 of your courses are CS courses, and the rest are some related courses (say, in math and sciences) plus more general education (humanities such as history and English).\n\nEven so, there's a linearity to the CS curriculum where certain courses are taken before others. Much of which courses you focus on will depend on your goals. \n\nIn any case, if you want to master this, you could go back to school. Yes, unrealistic, but as pointed out earlier, it's tough for CS majors to complete this curriculum with decent grades. They have the added benefit of time, friends, teaching assistants, professors, and perhaps even free tutoring (or paid tutoring). CS majors are often under time pressure to learn this material so some feel, even after a semester, that they missed stuff along the way.\n\nOK, now to address your question, this is my opinion on what to take.\n\n1. Discrete Math \n * This is a precursor to data structures and algorithms. I would say it's not fully required. Discrete math, in my opinion, should be a course where you learn how to do mathematical proofs. Specifically, direct proofs, proof by contradiction, and the various induction proofs (weak, strong, structural). It should also cover formal logic, in particular, propositional and predicate calculus. The rest of discrete math is a bunch of topics where you can apply your knowledge of proofs. Many self-taught learners tend to skip this and head into DSA, and that can work too.\n1. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)\n * If you were to take a real courses in DSA, especially algorithms, then you'd do work on solving recurrence relations. This is the math behind big O notation. Otherwise, you could skip that, and just know certain algorithms O(n) or O(lg n) or whatever. It would help to work out book problems, but I think implementing the various data structures and algorithms is educational. For example, I don't use pointers for work (at least, not to build linked data structures).\n1. Computer Architecture\n * I taught this a number of times. My current belief is the goal of a computer architecture course is to show you can build a CPU that can run a simple assembly language out of a clock, a flip-flop (a one-bit register), and logic gates. I had envisioned the class building this in software, but never got around to doing that. Personally, I think CS majors learn that the computer isn't completely magic (yes, it does do a lot) and realize, yes, 0's and 1's can make a program do something.\n\nBeyond that, I think you can read about the rest (e.g., computer networking and operating systems). I've taken OS before, so building something (again, super simple) is interesting, but you realize that real OSes are extremely complex, but at its core, it's something you can understand if you strip it to its bare essentials.\n\nThe question, should you choose to study this, is how much time you can devote to this, and how deeply do you want to study it given a lack of resources. If you can find some online courses offered through a reputable university (you wouldn't get credit, but you could follow the content), then that can help structure your learning.\n\nAt this point, you need to pick an initial starting point, which is probably data structures and algorithms as that's the most pertinent and comes up in job interviews.",

        "body": "When you call a function, you are asking for something.  Return is how the function gives you what you ask for.\n\nTake some code like:\n```\nfunction timesTwo(int i) int {\n    return i * 2;\n}\n```\n\nThis is a function, which means it can be called from other places.  It has an `int` *argument*, `i`; this means that, whenever someone wants to call this function, they will have to supply some int to be used in place of `i`.  The final `int` after the right parenthesis denotes the *return type*.  In other words, whenever you call this function, you are *asking for an int*.  So, in all, the function represents a sort of contract: I give you an int, and you give me an int back.\n\nHere's how you might use this function:\n\n```\nint x = 5;\nint y = timesTwo(x);\n```\n\nWhat's going on here?  You have an `int`, `x`.  Then you initialize another `int`, `y`, and assign it to *the result of the function call*.  As we said, calling timesTwo means supplying an int, and then receiving one in return.  Here we are supplying `x` - that is, `5`.\n\n`timesTwo` receives `5` and uses it in place of `i` in the function body, so we can read the return statement as `return 5 * 2` which evaluates to `return 10`.\n\nNow, timesTwo promised its caller that it would give it back an int, and that is exactly what `return` does - it gives `10` back as the result of the call and gives control back to the caller, which assigns the returned value to `y`.\n\nEssentially, the return type of a function allows you to use a call to that function *as* a value of the return type in most places in your code, because the return type is essentially a promise that the function will give you a value to use there.  `Return` is how functions actually make good on that promise.",

        "body": ">The specific example was including \\`using namespace std\\` which I know full well has issues, but it made me question what \"industry standards\" even entail.\n\nThe real issue is using that directive in a header file, because then you force any client who wants to \"include\" your header file, to also be \"using namespace std\", which she may not want to do.\n\nAs for \"industry standards\", though, the only \"real\" industry standard is \"to follow the rules of the team leader\", as it were. In a University course, your prof. is the \"team leader\" position so if he/she says \"thou shalt not use 'using namespace std'\" then that is The Rule and you must follow it.\n\nFor my own C++ code I like to use 'using namespace std' because personally it makes my code easier to read for \"me\". But I can see the arguments against it for \"production code\" (e.g. what if the future C++35 adds a new word to the std:: namespace, a word which you're already using in your local code). A better in-between solution is to use \"individual using\" directives like \"using std::cout\", \"using std::cin\", etc. However, that's a bunch of stuff to type out -- so to use it in practice you should either put them all in a header file, or use some smart IDE that inserts them all for you at the top (some IDEs can automatically insert all of them for you as needed).\n\nMost C++ programmers I have seen online just tend to avoid using directives and just write a bunch of std::cout, std::cin blah blah everywhere, which personally I think contributes to the impression that C++ is very difficult to read. It's a subtle style issue balanced on an issue of future-proofing the code. Sometimes we cannot have it both ways, unfortunately. Try to find a style which is readable for you, but also respect the local standards if they are in place. That's the best we can do for this.\n\nA commonly cited example is that \"using namespace std\" imports names which you may want to use for your own variables, like \"max\". OK, you got me there. However, how you resolve this is up to you. You can name your local variable something else, for example, \"max\\_value\", or you can even resolve it by adding a trailing underscore, like \"max\\_\", since the likelihood of a name ending in an \\_ being declared in a Standard or in an external library is extremely slim. Personally I got used to that style from programming in Python. I know it looks kind of ugly at first, but it seems like Python has a lot of reserved words that I often want to use as local variable names, so I ended up seeing a programmer using that convention when porting code from C++ to Python (to append \\_ to a name which we would 'obviously' use in the C++ code but which was  'conflicting' in the Python code), and it stuck for me.\n\nHowever, I would hesitate to use this style in \"production team code\" unless I saw explicitly that it were already being employed there. Stick to the local conventions, is rule 1.\n\nSame goes for prefixing \"m\\_\" to member names in C++ class designs. Personally I think that's weird in C++, but \\*a bunch\\* of programmers do it for various reasons. So, if that convention is being used currently in the code you're working on, then by all means, continue to do so in that codebase when you add code to that class, for the sanity of your co-workers. It's kind of a weird style rule which seems to only apply for the unique situation to make naming the parameters of a constructor initiazer list less confusing. OTOH, once the convention is in place, something in your brain associates seeing the the \"m\\_\" before a name as a hint that it's a member name, and vice versa (that an absence of the m\\_ means it's \\*not\\*). So this makes it kind of hard to \"quit\" using this convention once you start using it.\n\nThe other benefit of m\\_ is that it makes \"naive autocomplete\" more convenient. By \"naive autocomplete\" I mean autocomplete which is not actually understanding your code, and which is just memorizing the symbols that you typed previously in the document or in other documents. So that's another convenience of that. Personally nowadays though I always try to use \"C++-aware\" environments for this language. Their availability nowadays is widespread enough.",

Most of the time, you don't need to do anything special other than make sure you don't take big performance losses from doing it wrong like trigger a page fault every iteration of a loop (this sort of thing is almost always a localized code problem, not a program wide management problem).

        "body": "IMO what separates a junior engineer from a senior engineer is the difference between solving a problem and architecting a solution.  A lot of that just comes down to time and experience as others have already pointed out.  I do think there are some things you can do to fast track your way to a more senior level though. \n\n* Pair program with other more senior engineers, especially early in a project so you can understand how they balance architecting a robust solution vs solving the immediate problem.  If you can coax one into being your mentor, even better.  Most employers encourage this sort of interaction to foster growth in their engineering departments, it's just a lot of devs can be solitary creatures and choose not to exercise this muscle.\n* Review PR's from other more senior engineers.  Sounds like you're already doing this to an extent, but don't be afraid to leave non-blocking comments on the PR and ask questions about how or why they did something.  If anything this will make them feel good for being so smart and getting to explain the cool thing they did to someone else.  A lot of people are afraid to ask questions because they think it will make them look dumb, but the opposite is almost always true with software development - in fact you will find senior engineers are often the most inquisitive.\n* Check your assumptions always.  Senior engineers ask lots of questions because they assume nothing.  Senior engineers don't learn to do something one way then always do things that way just because that's the way they already know.  They try to consider every angle in every circumstance before those circumstances are encountered, which may mean exploring a different solution instead.\n* RTFM more.  Go through all the docs for everything in your organization's tech stack and familiarize yourself with the basics, focusing on a breadth of understanding rather than a depth of knowledge.  You want to know what possibilities and capabilities exist in your environment, so you can consider all those options in your project planning.  You can then return to the docs for a deep dive into the specific features that prove relevant to your current project.\n\nHope this helps.  At the end of the day the answer is still \"put in the time\", but I think these are some ways you can put in that time more efficiently.",

Even after learning them, when coding for your first game you will face several hindrances no matter what course u did, you will be required to debug it yourself, search online, maybe ask others for help online. This is how you learn programming by working on projects that interests you. If you like web development, then study JavaScript and make your first website (idk much bout web dev not my expertise). Don't be dependent on courses, learn only that what interests you and try to work on projects to improve your skills.

Really easy.\n\n2) CSS. What fonts do I want to use, what text colours and background colours, where on the page do I want these things to be. This is quite easy for a simple site.\n\n3) Javascript. Anything interactive, ranging from very simple (this button will hide something when I click it) to absurdly complicated. You can make a simple site without any javascript at all, but learning javascript will take a bit of time if you're a beginner.\n\n4) Backend. If you want to store any information securely -, so that the user can't access or change it, or so you can share it between users - you need to send it to a backend (usually via an http request). This requires learning quite  lot.",

This is used for storing things, and looking things up that need to be retained longer than the page is open. Frequently used to serve login systems, provide details about something pulled from a data source like a database and many more things.\n\nThose are all the bits you need to create a website you can run and test locally and covers the majority of things you'll want to learn if it is new to you.\n\nIf you wanted to learn to build all the things for the website and understand how they work then that's all you need.\n\nIf you are more interested in getting something up and running quickly without learning the basics then these options below exist. But these involve a bit more understanding of the operational side of websites and servers.\n\nThere are also lots of tools available that can do what is called \"code generation\", like hugo, and they simplify and automate a bunch of the above to get you going without having to learn all the things, but the price you pay for using those tools is that it limits what you can change and do.\n\nAnother thing used by a lot of websites is a thing called a  Content Management System (CMS), a commonly used example of that is WordPress, this gives you a drag and drop visual editor to create fully fledged websites, again at the cost of limiting what you can do \n\nThe last bit is putting the website onto a network or the Internet and that's a whole other kettle of fish with lots of options depending on what you built, so I'd advise you to not worry about this yet, just build it first.",

If you can feel it then your colleagues and managers can feel it, too. They may not tell you explicitly, but my guess is that they can feel that you're floudering. There's a saying that goes something like \"the reward for good work is more work\". That sounds like some sort of sysphean dystopia, but there's some truth here. If people aren't giving you work, it's most likely because people don't know what you can do. Or worse, they know your abilities and don't trust it. \n\nCouple of things I'd do:\n\n1. be more pro-active in sharing your accomplishments\n2. be more pro-active in asking for work\n3. learn to \"manage up\". A lot of people assume managers are there to parent employees, but they are just colleagues tasked with delgating work to and reporting on you. Help them in that work.",

I think a lot of us in tech, even people who’ve been doing this for years, go through periods where we question if we really know what we’re doing.

But tools are there to help us—using them smartly doesn’t take away from what you’ve learned.\n\nIt also sounds like part of what’s getting to you is the environment itself. Being stuck in a process-heavy, bureaucratic setup where you barely get to touch code would make *anyone* start doubting themselves. It’s not about you being incapable—it’s about the situation not giving you a chance to actually do the work you know how to do.\n\nIt’s still early days at your new job, and sometimes it takes a while to settle in.

Per the definition of big-O, that would mean that there exists some positive integers M and c₀ where c^(k+1) ≤ Mc^k for all c ≥ c₀.\n\nWe can simplify this inequality by dividing both sides by c^k to give us c ≤ M. (Note that we don't have to worry about accidentally dividing by zero, since we can safely assume all variables are positive, per the definition of Big-O and our constraint on c₀).\n\nBut, this inequality c ≤ M results in a contradiction: c can grow forever, so clearly cannot remain less then our constant M. Therefore, c^(k+1) ∊ O(cᵏ) cannot be true, which in turn means that O(c^(k+1)) cannot be a subset of O(cᵏ). Therefore, by the definition of set equality, the two sets cannot be equivalent.",

Here, **O(c\\*(k+1)) = O(c\\*k + c)**. Here,  **c\\*k > c ie c\\*k** will be **asymptotically bigger** than **c ,** because c,k are variables and nonetheless will be positive, and since in Big-O, we care about the dominant term, therefore it will be **equal** to **O(c\\*k**). An example can be c = 10 and k = 10. c\\*k = 10\\*10 = 100. c \\* (k+1) = 10 \\* 11 = 110, which is asymptotically equal. \n\nHowever, for the other case ie **O(c\\^k) Vs O(c \\^(k+1))** ; here **O(c\\^(k+1)) = O(c \\* c \\^ k)**. However , c is a variable and **not** a constant. Therefore, **c\\^(k+1)** is **not** asymptotically same as **c\\^k**. Therefore, **O(c\\^k)** and **O(c \\^(k+1))** are **not equal.**  An example can be c = 10 and k = 4 . c\\^k = 10\\^4 and c\\^(k+1) = 10\\^5 ; a **10 times** increase in the running time**.** \n\nThis is my interpretation , I could be wrong as well. Please correct if my approach is wrong. \n\n(Also, note that though c,k are input variables, when we use them in Big O , it is expected that they are large positive values, because we care about the asymptotic growth as the input size gets large. So all inputs are expected to grow larger and larger. For people who are not familiar with the word 'asymptotic', in general it means that how fast the running time will grow when input size increases. Take two functions : n\\^2 and n , where n is the input. For some duration, n\\^2 and n will run in parallel, but as n increases, n\\^2 will grow rapidly compared to n , then we say that n\\^2 is asympototically larger than n. )",

Just having a Sec+ and 0 actual work experience is worth pretty much nothing.\n\nCybersecurity sounds entry-level because of titles like \"Junior Penetration Tester\" and beginner-friendly certs like CompTIA Sec+, but the jobs actually expect you to already have hands-on experience like from being a sysadmin, network tech etc. Sure, you can pass Sec+ with 100/100 points, and you'll still have absolutely no idea how to iterate over Active Directory and find attack vectors in a Windows environment, or how to securely set up a domain controller (random, not connected examples).\n\nSay you see a Junior pen tester job, and it requires a Sec+, OSCP and/or GPEN certs. You might therefore conclude that you can get it without much experience because 1. it's asking for a junior and 2. you can just obtain the certs.\n\nYou see, \"junior\" is there because it's an entry to the role of a pentester, but not in an entry domain. It's a junior role for someone who has been an network administrator for 5 years, or a junior role for someone that did different levels of SOC support for 5 years etc. You will be expected to have x amount of years in lead up roles before you're hired as a pentester. You could for example get an IT helpdesk job, during which you can get your Sec+ or similar. From there you can try and move into a sysadmin role or similar, where you will actually be working in a real environment for a few years, during which you might try getting OSCP and similar certs, and only then would you be applying for a junior pentester job, only after you spent years solving issues and learning how things actually work in practice.\n\nYou need actual experience working in real IT environments before you try to become an expert at any of its domains. You wouldn't be doing security audits on code written in C++ if you don't have years of experience working writing C++, similarly you wouldn't be doing network infrastructure security implementations if you never even set up an AP, a switch, a vlan, a domain controller etc. So say you do have 10 years of writing C++ in various areas, and now you want to shift to cybersec, only then would you be looking for \"junior\" positions in which you would do C++ code audits, not because you don't have experience with C++, but because you don't have experience doing audits in a c++ environment.",

Unless you have a reasonably powerful Nvidia GPU it can be a bit challenging but I can sum it up for you. \n\nGet comfy ui and watch a few quick tutorials about it. Then learn about something called \"IP adapter\". Basically, it allows you to take an image and upload it to comfy UI to create images based on the likeness of the uploaded image.\n\nThe models you use are open free to download from within the comfy UI GUI. Most people use stable diffusion, but if you have a really powerful GPUs like 4090/3090 you can use Flux. \n\nOr, if you're looking for something specific (stylistic artistic styles) you can check out civitai.com (huggingface for image generation). You can find a wide variety of LoRAs (sort of like really fine tuned mini models) for exactly what you're looking for. After typing this out, I would probably avoid going too deep down this rabbit hole if you only have 15 days. \n\nAs for the video generation, I don't have a lot of experience with video generation models, but diffusion generative AI (video generation) is very similar to image generation as far as I know. So, I imagine there are models that exist that can operate with IP adapter etc. However, image generation is very computationally expensive and video generation just takes it to another level. \n\nIf you don't have access to powerful GPUs, look into some of the virtual machine services. They are fairly cheap, maybe a couple dollars per hour or find a way to use a free Google Collab for compute. \n\nThen, just spool up python and create a gradio web UI for the user to do all of this connected through API. It sounds like a lot, and it kind of is, but you could definitely pull it off in 15 days.\n\nThis is a weird way to do a hackathon, IMO. Mostly because they're giving you what they want the result to be. I think a better approach would be \"Build a whimsical app that leverages generative AI (image and or video)\"",

If an attacker gets access to a database with the hashed passwords, they could just make a dummy client just directly send each hashed password and get access to every single account. \n\nIf the hashing is done server-side and an attacker gets access to the database, the hashed passwords are useless since they don't know people's original passwords which will be put through the hash. \n\nIf you really really are worried you can hash both client side and server side using two completely separate cryptographically secure hashing systems. \n\nHowever this doesn't add very much security - if a hacker compromises an individual's password they can still run the hash, or if they compromise the hash they can just send it directly as a dummy client. The only thing you're protecting is a potential client trust (e.g. what if they're storing the passwords in plaintext?).

Only time an admin gets to access serverside data is when a user is banned/suspended (because in this enviroment it means you either put the server's security at risk or repeatedly violated TOS/Server TOS) and the data is needed for the administrators (namely the owner of the server, for other purposes there is a separate security role called moderators, whom get lots less info for the exact reasons some of you pointed out) to debug what exactly did you break.

Though it's ideal that developers only get access to the information they need to test and debug their code, this isn't always necessary. Adding a bunch of restrictions will make it harder for the developers for a slight amount of added trust.\n\nFor HIPAA compliance developers may see patient records and information to debug stuff and work on code and features, but the data that they see cannot contain personally identifiable information like name/email address/phone number/home address. Since there are also people working on the login portion and might need to see this information, there's a separation or \"iron curtain\" in place where the people who work with systems that handle personally identifiable information cannot have access to medical records or information. \n\nOther industries just make you \"promise really really hard\" under the consequence of huge lawsuits and financial repercussions. Like if you're working at a bank you might get information that Apple is executing an order to sell $1 billion of USD over the course of 3 days, or even non-public information about acquisitions and mergers. Not everyone has access to this information at the bank however, just the people working on the computer systems or on the deals. A person could potentially abuse this and frontrun their own trades or hand the information off to a relative. However IMO the stakes are too high to do this in nearly every case, and everyone that has access to this non-public information has a restriction on buying individual stocks, commodities contracts, or large amounts of any currency without explicit approval from compliance.\n\nI don't know about the realm of modern laws for social media, but I do know at one point in time there was a creepy Facebook employee that was using their position and access to data stalk a user. Since then Facebook has added additional restrictions on the amount of information granted to developers, and getting more information about someone specific had to be run through a compliance team to ensure it was for debugging/programming reasons.\n\nThe one place where this material non-public information restriction does not exist, unfortunately, is for the US congress. They are given zero restrictions on stocks or products they can purchase or sell, and a huge ass 45 day window to report trades. It's concerning especially considering the amount of non-public information they deal with. Like if a congressperson knows that there is a huge deal in the works for a car manufacturer, they may buy the stock with no restriction, and only have to report the trade way after the deal has gone through and the stock has made significant gains.",

Imagine you have a function that is called calcUserData ehich gets a user and does some processing. In this case you would only care about the processing part, as that is the main functionality of this function. Problen is now that this function calls the db to get the user data, and wr of course dont want to include that in the unit test as we ONLY want to test the function.\n\nThis is were you use testing doubles as you mentioned, mocks, fakes and stubs. Mocks tell you if an interaction happened, for example you can check if the database function getUserData was actually called by calcUserData.\n\nFakes are working implementations but simplified. Lets say that instead of mocking away the database, you want to use an in memory db, or you could even store values into a list if all you want is something to put in and retrieve data from.\n\nStubs are when you want to pre-define a response. Imagine you have a function called isAdmin, which simply checks the db if the user is an admin or not, instead of actually calling the db we can simply stub it to return True or False. This is useful when you want to force an interaction. Imagine you want to test if you correctly throw an error to the user if they are not an admin, you can do that with stubbing.\n\nThe mindset you need for unit testing is using these 3 tools to force yourself to ONLY test what a small piece of code does. The mistake people make is including dependencies into unit tests which makes them closer to integration tests.\n\nHope this helped a bit, in a rush need to go to work now but if you have any more questions just comment Ill get back to you.",

        "body": "This may or may not be relevant. I was fairly convinced in my sophomore year of undergrad (studying CS) that I wasn't going to be a professional coder (I decided I'd go to law school after graduation, with the intent of going into patent law, which is what I do now).  I did it for a number of reasons, some of which included that I didn't love programming all that much and I wasn't naturally good at it.  \n\nBeing around people who were absolutely brilliant at programming and building things really made me feel pretty bad about where I was at. I could do my courses just fine and ended up graduating with honors, but I never built my own projects or anything, I just did my course work.  \n\nAnyway, I have no idea if the additional two years for you would look anything like my last two years, but I did them just fine. I learned a lot, and a lot of it was both interesting and relevant to my ultimate career. I also build things now as hobby projects occasionally, even though I don't do it professionally.  \n\nAnyway, all this to say, I was able to do my junior and senior years in CS just fine, even knowing that I wasn't going to be programming professionally and also believing I was just bad at it compared to some of my brilliant peers.  \n\nI guess I'd encourage the BS instead of the associate's, because it will probably open more doors to you.  \n\nAs far as discipline and motivation, could you maybe talk to a few of your friends at school and say, hey I'd really like to build something but I'm having trouble on my own. Could we form a small group and build something together? That would keep you accountable not just to yourself, but your friends as well.\n\nOn the, \"I want to learn but I suck at this,\" piece, I think you need to break your problem down into smaller, more manageable chunks. If one task is just too overwhelming, break it up into smaller, easier to understand pieces, and solve them one by one. Ask for help from a friend, a professor, a TA, Reddit, Discord, or even AI for things you just really cannot solve. \n\nAlso, sucking at something you haven't learned yet is, in fact, the normal, natural state. That's how you get better: you start with sucking at it, you work on it, you get better, you work some more, you get better, and so on. \n\nI don't know what projects you've done for your classes, but start with those. Which ones did you do well on? Take what you did and do it again, but a little different, a little better. Add a feature. Maybe you did a sorting algorithm, like Quicksort, on integers. Do it again, but on floats or doubles. Do it again with individual characters, then character strings. Do it so that the sort is by length of the string rather than its actual value. Do it with templates so you can generically sort any type. Try building a visualization for it. Then whatever language you originally learned it in, try it in a different language. Try it in seven different languages, then pick the one you end up liking the most and try something new in that language.\n\nDo the same thing but for a project you didn't do well on. Make it better. \n\nForce yourself to take those two projects, and build something that uses both of them to do a third thing. Challenge your creativity. \n\nJust a bunch of thoughts on things you could do.  \n\nAnother thing you can try, get on ChatGPT or Gemini or something, tell it what concepts you know, and ask it to give you an idea for a project you can build with those concepts. Then go build it. Give yourself a deadline and stick to it. Tell your friends and family, \"I'm building this thing, I'm going to have it done by this date, I would love to show it to you that day so you can see what I'm working on.\" Now you're accountable to them to get the thing done.",

If you did, well, why aren't you still doing it? If you didn't...consider that the alternative to learning this stuff is to go back to it.\n\n(if you weren't working before doing this because you were a teenager living at home, often the only cure for motivation problems is \"drop out of school, work construction or as a line cook for a few years, realize how much that sucks and then come back to school more motivated to learn\")\n\nLearning any new skill that's hard enough to be worth getting paid for is going to require some motivation and some mental fortitude. This is a far more general problem than just programming, and you probably need to examine the rest of your life to look for how to fix it - maybe you need to be getting up earlier and going to the gym, maybe you need to eat better, maybe you need to detox from social media or tiktok or video games. You know your life, I don't.\n\nThere are definitely some things you can do to make it more fun. Absolutely find a passion project like a Minecraft mod to work on. But you also need to build up your ability to tough it out doing things you don't want to do, otherwise everything else will be for naught.",

Now I find myself running through documentation and also reading others peoples code on github. \n\n>How do you build discipline when you often lose motivation or feel stuck early on?\n\nMotivation is a tricky thing because its what initially drives you to pursue the thing and then discipline is what keeps you going, all I can say is as things get easier and clearer you will be more likely to continue it is a struggle at first for sure. When you get stuck and you feel like you cant continue take a break and come back there have been so many times where I struggled on something then randomly during my day I figure it out.\n\n>Would you still recommend finishing the last 2 years of a CS bachelor if programming doesn't come naturally to you?\n\nAbsolutely. I am a firm believer that programming doesnt come naturally to anyone for the most part its really just about practice and lots of it.\n\n>Are there any beginner-friendly project ideas that helped *you* break the tutorial cycle?\n\nStart with something simple like rock paper scissors and progressively move up in difficulty, AI is actually pretty good at giving you ideas on this so you can use that.\n\n\n\n>Do you think making a Minecraft mod (or something similar I personally enjoy) is a good way to get into coding?\n\nYea tons of people start off doing game modding as an introduction whatever will make you keep doing it the very next day. \n\n  \nTake a step back write a bunch of small programs and then move up slowly in difficulty understand the language you are using so you dont add additional struggle by needing to think of syntax when you are programming.",

See if you can publish it somewhere. If/when you do get a job, the programming position is more than just programming so this experience will be helpful. If you can even use your app, even better.   \n  \nI created a Todo app 6 years ago to test a concept and ended up publishing it online and use it for my grocery list. You can add, edit, and delete todo items. If you click an item it colors the background to blue. You click it again and it toggles it again. \n\n[http://e-applist.azurewebsites.net/](http://e-applist.azurewebsites.net/)\n\nIt saves the data locally using localStorage. No API calls. Nothing special, but I've found it very useful. Create your own. The more you use it. The more you use it, the more that anyone uses it, the more likely you will come back to do bug fixes and updates. \n\nIf you are interested in addons/extensions for games, this is fun as well. Create something simple, even if it already exists and publish it so others can use it. I did this for World of Warcraft. When you see 1,000 downloads it's really exciting to get back in there to do bug fixes or add more. When a new expansion comes out, I have more updates to do. \n\nWhen you have a valid reason to program, it becomes easier to stick with it.

The ones that do it out of passion for free will be in high demand and thus can't really do that many 1:1 clients without cutting into their work/personal life too much. \n\nIn regards to actually paying for a 1:1 mentor, I am open to the idea but this is coming from someone who is already employed and making pretty good money. Beginners that want to break into the industry likely don't have the funds to hire mentors and mentors that offer free services might not be that good or are more selective (i.e. higher demand).\n\nJust some random thoughts on the subject",

        "body": "I've seen people offer to mentor/tutor for free, but what those people are willing to do and what the person wants from a tutor can be completely different.\n\nFor example, a mentor might say \"Watch this video, and work on this exercise, and get back to me in a few days and show me your progress\". The student might want a custom lecture, want it recorded or transcribed, then be hand-held through solving the problems, and, one more thing, they have to be available when the student is available. I'm exaggerating, of course.\n\nWhen you see posters looking for help, they want someone to motivate them, figure out stuff when they get stuck, keep it interesting. Some students are given assignments, but then come back and said \"things got busy\" and they didn't have time to do what was being asked, so the mentor decides the student wants too much, but isn't serious about doing stuff on their own.\n\nOne key is to level-set between mentor and student. The mentor should ask the student what they expect, i.e., how much time per week, what they expect the interaction to look like, etc. A potential mentor would express their expectations. Hopefully, they could find an agreement.\n\nFrom the student perspective, I'm sure they'd prefer free over paying, and they would be concerned, if they did pay, that the mentor was any good (presumably, they could quit if it wasn't working well).\n\nIt's also a challenge to mentor well. A mentor needs to be aware of what the student needs and what they can provide. Some people over-explain going on and on with a concept not realizing the student has tuned out. They don't get the student to do some tasks during their meetings to keep things active.\n\nIntermediate programmers might fare better because they already know some programming. The student has to know what they want from a mentor and the mentor has to know what they want to offer.\n\nLook at the topics in this subreddit. Many are looking for a first language to learn, or they're worried about AI, or they need motivation to do something. I doubt the creators of this subreddit expected those kinds of posts to dominate the subreddit.",

Most ppl are unwilling to actually do the work or things suggested.  I'm not saying this is you or everyone but a lot of ppl don't truly understand what a mentor does and just expects us to hold their hand and give them a job from out connections.  This is also why I think the mentor finds you not the other way around because we wait until we see someone showing the signs of someone that can actually benefit from a mentor\n\n  \n\\-  Would you pay for a 1:1 mentor\n\nThis is really up to you and I \"personally\" don't like charging but I could completely see why someone would and have charged in the past for ppl that aren't local to me.  I tried doing a discord server/meetup online and ppl just weren't as serious in my experience like they are when we do it locally and I think it's cuz of the low cost of entry to just click \"join server/meeting\".  \n\nYou are paying for this whether you have a mentor or not.

Linux and mac are just a lot more prevalent in the open source community and install instructions for libraries often assume you're using unix, or the windows instructions are an afterthought.

That being said, I think Go would be a good language to write a lower-level implementation of these tools, it's jsut that it would require a deep understanding of the filetypes you're concerned with converting between. If you want the challenge, I'd pick Go, C++, or Rust (in that order because I've never used Rust yet). Also you can't beat Python's simplicity and elegance, if production level speed isn't a concern, or you don't expect to need to batch operations, then you can write these tools out fully in pure python. Writing your own conversion software in Python then trying to use it for heavy work might feel sluggish if you're not very particular about optimization.",

Its like drawing rectangles under a curve for the first 2 weeks of calc 1 ... if you got the concept 30 min into it, the next 2 weeks are blah blah.\n\nTake data structures: almost all modern languages have either these built into the language or libraries where they are done for you.  It serves you no purpose to build a linked list out of pointers in C; first, its inefficient (page faults), second its error prone (pointers and inexperience don't mix), and thirdly as I said, its already there to be used in a library or language innate.  What you need to know is when to use what data structures, and that isn't even well explained in the courses (they focus on reinventing them, not how to use them!).  So go review a web site (not AI generated, find a human written one) on when to use what data structures.\n\nBig-O is just a jargon notation.  Its like the math class on convergence of sequences (if you had that one?) where you examine the dominating term to see if it converges on infinity... except here we look for it to converge on an exponent.  So bubble sort, where you go over the whole list of say numbers, find the smallest one, move it one location at a time until it gets to the top, repeat for the list except ignore the top item, then next time ignore the top 2 items...  converges on N\\*N amount of work being done to sort the data, which you can review online how to get there but its 2 nested loops effectively over N each, so its not too hard to see (this one).  Proving an algorithm takes however many operations is helpful to know if its good at its job.  The good news is that studying algorithms will include an explanation of how to do big-O & use it.\n\nWhich leads me to algorithms.  While a LOT of algorithms are included in languages and libraries, you still need to study them and to be able to solve your own problems using either the known common ones strung together or a totally new thing.  I advise you to then do a quick overview of datastructures as I said above, and after that, do a pretty solid study of intro to algorithms and keep on digging into it as deep as you think is useful.  I recommend not getting trapped/bogged down in graphs or graph theory unless you think you will be using that stuff (its pretty rare in most fields).\n\nafter those, study object oriented programming if you have not gone deep into it.  The last thing to do is design patterns, which require an in depth understanding of OOP & other basics or much of what these are doing will not make sense.\n\navoid leet code.  Its like tricky word problems in a math class more than practical programming.   It can be fun, but in real life, no one will actively try to confuse you with the requirements and if they do, you can ask questions.  Hit it up SOME, but don't \"grind\" it.  The most useful thing it will teach you is how unexpected inputs and edge cases can really mess up something you thought you had working.  THAT is useful and practical!",

I've seen people who want to learn a new programming language, and a new web framework, and work on some project they have no idea how to get started. They don't budget the time it takes to learn all of that. They justify it by saying they'll learn new things, but have no contingency if they run out of time.\n\nMy suggestion is to find out who has more experience, your friend with React or you with Angular or if one of you can pick stuff up quickly. Or do both. Plan out a rough idea of what needs to get done, and how it would be done with Angular and React.\n\nIn the meanwhile, give yourself about a week or two to learn Django (or use Flask, which is allegedly lighter weight and might be easier to learn). Build out a super simple web app (to-do) just to see the steps needed. If you're still mired in Django and Flask after two weeks and realize it's too much to learn, then go back to the technology you already know.\n\nIf you can start learning Django and Flash right now, you can see how fast you can learn it. I would suggest regular meetings (every day) and perhaps in person if you can manage it during this process. Essentially, you are waiting for a go or no go scenario (go meaning yes, do it in Django/Flask, and no go meaning go back to something familiar).",

Strong demand, because every company eventually wants to make their app\n* Game Programming (learning C++ or C# (for Unity)) if you're into games or computer graphics, but it’s competitive and may be not very paying, unless you land a unicorn gig.\n* AI/ML and Data Science — this is very much right now (obviously), but it’s quite different from regular programming, strong math skills required and, of course, interest in data.\n* Cloud/DevOps — there's and there will always be demand for maintaining cloud/server infrastructure\n* Cybersecurity — very underrated, but the need is massive and growing.\n\nWhichever direction you go, make sure it’s something you actually enjoy working with.

        "body": "I really admire that you're diving into HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python at 54—your passion and diverse background are definite strengths. That said, I want to be as candid as possible:\n\nFreelancing in programming typically comes after years of experience in the industry. While there's no formal barrier to entry beyond setting up a profile on a freelancing platform, this low threshold means you're competing against a vast pool of skilled coders—many with years of experience, advanced degrees, and robust portfolios filled with positive client reviews. Back in the mid-2010s, there was a surplus of tech needs, and companies were more willing to take on individuals with bootcamp training or certifications in lieu of real experience because the talent pool was scarce. In today's market, the situation has reversed—tech is high-paying and attractive, leading to a surplus of highly experienced, often laid-off programmers. Most companies have their pick of talent, whether hiring full-time employees or freelancers, so they have little incentive to take a chance on entry-level coders or invest time and money into training someone without a proven track record. It's not impossible by any means, but it will take several people willing to \"give you a chance.\" Until you build up those client experience reviews, finding freelance gigs will be especially challenging. It's the classic chicken-and-egg scenario: you need a job to gain experience, but you need experience to get the job.\n\nThe alternative—landing an entry-level programmer role remotely—is almost completely out of the picture. Remote positions nowadays are typically reserved for those who already have a strong background because the market for remote roles is fiercely competitive. The COVID era, where remote work was the norm, is rapidly fading; everyone wants to work from home, but few get to. In many parts of the world, especially in regions like the U.S. (at least where I'm writing), remote experienced freelance or full-time programmers are still a thing—but entry-level remote roles are virtually non-existent. Even on-site roles face fierce competition. I'm not sure how things shake out in places like Albania or wider Europe, but the trend is similar: only highly experienced folks, often bolstered by a flood of laid-off talent, get those remote opportunities.\n\nOn top of that, generative AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are changing the game. These tools can handle many of the routine tasks that junior developers used to do—completing boilerplate code and similar work much faster than a human. As a result, the real value in programming today isn't just about writing code; it's about leveraging it to solve complex, real-world problems. The true edge lies in depth and creativity, where your ability to draw on years of industry-specific experience can help you harness generative AI efficiently—something AI by itself can't do. This shift leaves even less room for entry-level programmers, as companies lean on the efficiency of AI and the expertise of veterans.\n\nMy advice? Keep learning the basics and enjoy the process, but once you have a solid foundation, jump into advanced tools like Google Gemini Canvas. This isn't just about using fancy new software—it's a reality check that shows how far generative AI has come and how it can outperform entry-level folks on routine tasks. It also reminds you that real value comes from using code to solve meaningful problems, something that only someone with experience and creative problem-solving skills can do. In other words, don't just aim to be a freelance coder; consider positioning yourself as a consultant who can merge your decades of industry expertise with your growing tech skills to solve niche, real-world challenges.\n\nBottom line: You haven't missed the boat yet, but today's boat is more like a high-speed ferry crammed with highly experienced, AI-enhanced pros. Your journey will be challenging, but by being realistic and strategic—focusing on niche projects, learning the basics, and quickly adopting advanced AI tools—you can carve out your own path in this highly competitive, ever-changing market.\n\nGood luck, and keep enjoying the learning process!",

Split a complex problem into multiple simple ones if you can. \n\nDon’t optimize unnecessarily. If a function doesn’t need to be fast, a simple, slow solution is fine. \n\nEach file in your project should be able to be read and understood by itself. Ideally no files should exceed 2000 lines and a competent developer should be able to read and understand the file within 1 hour. After reading the file they should understand what functionality the file provides, what libraries and other files the file depends on, how often the file’s functions are expected to be called (once an hour vs 1000 times a second), and be confident that the file doesn’t have bugs. \n\nYour code should be able to be read from top to bottom. A reader ideally should not have to jump around a file, or jump between multiple files for things to make sense. \n\nUse functions to eliminate/reduce similar code blocks. \n\nInline most single use functions. \n\nUse single line functions sparingly. \n\nReduce the amount of useless information that the reader has to see. Example: if a class’s field is the same 99% of the time, use a default value for the field in the __init__ function. If you pass that field in every time, you’ll waste space and you’ll make the more important set fields less visible. \n\nUse white space to separate code blocks. Too much white space can be a bad thing. \n\nIdeally a function should fit on one screen, so the reader doesn’t have to scroll up if they need to look back at a line. \n\nCode is great when it looks so simple and obvious that most readers would assume that it was easy to write.",

Each subdomain has it's own docker container and I use nginx as a reverse proxy.  I use a docker-compose file to manage my containers.  My static site doesn't use a docker image, just a location on my server, but my web apps have docker images that are hosted on ghcr.io (GitHub container registry).  The docker-compose file pulls the image for those apps and starts the container with the configs I need.\n\nI think a lot of this is separate from programming, but I think they are useful skills to have (and it has worked out for me as learning this info has helped me transition to a swe role from a non-swe position).",

This method works because you are attempting to reproduce the coding style of another.   You are learning how his code works.    Just keep attempting to reproduce the web page.    When you can reproduce the webpage without viewing the code contained inside, you have successfully accomplished your mission.   Keep up the good work.

These textbooks are quite expensive because of the publishers policies.\n\nAs for the book itself, I see it as a decent reference textbook. It's rigorous and shows you the mathematical details. However, it's also super dense and kind of dry. You do need to have good math skills to go through it. I used it for example less for sorting but more for trees.\n\nAlgorithms by Sedgewick for example I found much more approachable and modern but I felt like it was also much less detailed on the math part.

Goodrich and Tamassia's book in Java is also ok, although I really did not do much with that book.\n\nProper DSA courses do require you to have a solid grasp of math notation and foundational math knowledge, so it really isn't an easy course per se.",

Which I think is a mistake, because it is the simple things that are hardest to understand - once you get them though, it is fairly easy to understand the many different complex algorithms that the book goes through.\n\nHonestly, I'd suggest something like Grokking Algorithms to read to understand the basic principles, and then use Wikipedia articles for each algorithm that you have to study - often they quote CLRS, but add additional explanations or pseudocode.\n\nCheck if your library has the book, and read some of the chapters in the syllabus - if you like their style of writing, by all means buy the book, if not, see if you can do without.",

But with a clear view that you are going to use it more as a roadmap for learning. Each time you hit a block as to how to get the next bit done that is what can guide you to head off and learn how to do something of that kind.\n\nSo first of all, it may be a simple question of 'what kind of code would I even need to make this dashboard page' which means you now have your question, and a focused thing to investigate and learn. You'll head off, figure out that you're going to need to create an HTML page, and style it with some CSS. You can learn the basics of those, and practice how to do it. Then you can come back and put that into your project.\n\nThe downside is you will need to re-do things a LOT. Because chances are the choices you make early on will be sub optimal. But if you do it this way I think it can offer a sensible means of helping you focus your learning. I did something quite similar with a stock controller application for my work when I was learning, and it worked ok.",

        "body": "To understand a reference documentation you need to **understand the concepts** it references first. \n\nOnce you do that, make sure you understand every paragraph. Do not take shortcuts (in the beginning). Actively compare your expectations with what you read. Does it really say what you expect/want it to say?\n\nReading documentation is a very active and hard process. I constantly check what I read against my expectations. It shows more unknowns: some I move away for later (🤔), others I keep on a stack to be resolved while reading on.\n\nI have no idea what flutter does and just checked some API reference (https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/gestures/BaseTapGestureRecognizer-class.html). Here is my thought process in reading the docs:\n\nBefore reading the first paragraph I assumed I know what a *gesture* is, and what a *tap* is.\n\nI soon recognised the *abstract* keyword, which told me to expect subclasses or even write subclasses to actually recognise a tap. I remembered to look for subclasses later.\n\nI read about a *arena*, and picture of fighting recognisers came to my mind. Maybe that is a model flutter used to decide which expected gesture best matches the recorded events my fingers do? Let’s look for more information.\n\nThere is something like a GestureArenaManager. Ok.\n\nWhat then is described matches my expectations on a tap. I was surprised to read about a button. Can I only tap buttons? What if I have a canvas to paint on or something? For now imagine a button that I can drag or tap. I expect to recognisers to fight it out in the arena.\n\nThe pointer concept in the next paragraph escaped me: maybe this down-1 down-2 refers to two fingers which touch? Is down-2 completely ignored? What is down-1 is on the button, but down-2 is not? 🤔\n\nThe next paragraph confirms that the class is abstract. *isPointerAllowed* does not make too much sense to me. The pointer concept is still weird. But the paragraph gives some indication how a gesture might be linked to a button: Subclassing has something to do with it.\n\nAha: a ready made, therefore less variable, therefore easier to understand *TabGestureRecognicer* does exist. Maybe I will have a look at it to better understand the concepts. Also this answers one part of the questions I stacked earlier: which subclasses to exist. My interpretation of *abstract* and *Base* are confirmed.    \nI do wonder: “tabs *of* the primary button”? I expected *on* the primary button! I thought of a button as a screen widget. Maybe it is something on a controller (remember: I still have no idea what flutter is)?\n\nI ignore ModalBarrier and inheritance for now.\n\nI move on to the constructor: Oh! What is a debugOwner? Must be a fancy flutter concept. Why do I set supportedDevices? What are devices? I need to learn more about flutter concepts. I need more context. Let’s read on, maybe I do not need to fully understand the constructor. I might back down to the simple TabGestureRecognizer.\n\nAllowedButtonsFilter refers back to scroll click. So Buttons are probably screen widgets and not controller elements. But why allow some and not others? Weird.\n\nDeadline: Ah that makes sense again: if it take too long to tap you loose and are out of the arena.\n\nDebugDescription is probably just a nice debug meta concepts. Like string conversion of Object in Java.\n\nDebugOwner is the recognizer’s owner. Weird: Is *ownership* just for debugging in flutter? Usually Ownership is an important concept to build hieraries and split responsibilities. 🤔\n\nGoing on …\n\nPrimaryPointer: the pointer this one is tracking: ok my assumptions about one or two pointers (Fingers?) with Down-1 and Down-2 from above might be correct: Down-2 is from another pointer that gets ignored.\n\nTeam: what is that???\n\nNow lots of methods what check and set lots of more or less expected or unknown stuff. \n\nI stop again at *getKindOfPointer*. What might different kinds of pointers be? I expect (before I click and read on) fingers and mouse pointers. I check on *PointerDeviceKind*: Touch, Mouse, Stylus, etc. my expectation is met.\n\nI thought the handle… methods to be called so an action can take place like a callback, but instead they make the recognizer handle events to do its own thing. \n\nInvokeCallback: it especially mentions exceptions: is to *just* handle exceptions? 🤔\n\nOk more methods ….\n\nIf I now like to know more, I would read on the subclass and look for some code which uses it. Maybe debug to further reject or support my current(!) understanding.\n\nNever trust your understanding :)",

        "body": "`RPC` in `gRPC` stands for **Remote Procedure Call**. Essentially the idea behind it is to expose API as a set of arbitrary *functions* and let the API clients call those functions.\n\nThe idea behind **REST** is to not expose functions per se, but to expose *resources* to let client directly manipulate them (read, make changes, make new ones, etc.). You can think of RPC functions as *verbs*. Meanwhile resources are *nouns*, and there's a limited set of verbs representing actions on those nouns. Specifically, the verbs are different HTTP request methods: GET, POST, DELETE, etc.\n\n**With REST APIs** you often can get the idea what you can or cannot do with it by looking at the available resources. Like, for an imaginary Reddit API you would see the resource `comment` and would assume that:\n\n`GET /api/comments?post_id=xyz`\n\nwould give you all comments for a specific Reddit post.\n\n**With RPC** this can be something like `getCommentsForPost(xyz)`, and gRPC would convert it to a protobuf on the way to and from the server.\n\nBoth approaches have **pros and cons**. REST became popular when many people started building APIs for web apps and mobile apps and used many different languages to make them. At the time the primary RPC technology was SOAP and XML-WebServices (essentially the same thing as gRPC except with XML and not protobuf), and not many languages had libraries for SOAP. With REST if your language could speak HTTP you were ready to use it.\n\nEven today, like you said gRPC is faster and theoretically should replace REST for everything, except that outside of about top 5 / top 10 most popular languages support for it is almost non-existent. Last time I worked with gRPC was about 5-6 years ago, and at the time there was no convenient way to make RPC calls from a web page, so the largest proportion of potential clients couldn't use it at all. I haven't looked at it since, to be honest.\n\nIn practice, REST can be fast enough for many / most situations, so people keep using it because it's convenient.",

In my experience it's also more fiddly to get working correctly and more difficult to test.\n\nIf you're talking about gRPC for service-to-service communication, that's definitely on the rise because if it's set up properly it can be significantly more performant and secure.",

Protocol buffers are more space + time efficient for message passing than JSON.\n2. gRPC is set up over HTTP 2, which means you can send many messages with less TCP/HTTP connection overhead (in a nutshell, many requests can share connections)\n\nAdvantage #1 doesn't require gRPC, you *could* protocol buffer encode your messages and send around binary payloads if you wanted to. This advantage doesn't actually apply very much to strings or small integers, so jumping through the hoops of defining and distributing protocol buffer definition files isn't really worth the effort usually.\n\nAs for advantage #2, this is actually something REST *can* have as well with HTTP 3, and depending on your network topology you can get the main benefits here without having to re-write any of your application code.\n\ngRPC is a godsend if you have internal services that are quite chatty with each other and are paying all the network/CPU bills for all of them, since the serialization cost and wire size is strictly better and sometimes better by a noticeable (double-digit percentage) margin. Protocol buffers are also quite nice because they allow you to generate message passing logic for multiple languages, meaning you don't have to write a lot of overhead to translate to/from JSON when your C++ data chugging service is talking to your NodeJS client-facing websocket server - but that only saves you effort if distributing/consuming that generated code is easy.",

For example:\n\n- To use protobuf you need a code generation step where you transform your proto files into the actual interfaces you implement + objects you use. It may not always be easy to integrate this into your build system in a seamless way, depending on your setup.\n- You'll also probably want to write some sort of wrapper to smooth out some of the tedium of launching your server and creating your clients.\n- Sharing protobuf definitions between different repos is a bit of a PITA, last I checked.\n\nThese factors mean that:\n\n1. For smaller companies or projects, you'll probably see negligible overhead from using plain-old HTTP + JSON. So, it's often not worth the effort of setting up gRPC + protobuf: the speed boost isn't big enough to justify switching for many.\n2. Using gRPC + protobuf _can_ be worth it for larger companies. However, you'll most likely use it purely internally and continue using HTTP + JSON for your externally-facing API -- the browser support for gRPC is not quite there. If your API is something designed for others to use, you'll also have to take into account that most users of your public API will (statistically speaking) be smaller companies or hobbyists that cannot or do not want to use gRPC + protobuf. So if you want to maximize adoption, you'll have to stick with the least common denominator, which is HTTP + JSON.",

        "body": "I was lucky to use it at a later stage (late 2000s), and by that time most glaring problems with SOAP were generally \"solved\".\n\nAll these WS-* standards were not pedantically defined, and in practice Java tools were doing whatever .NET tools were doing and vice versa. Both Microsoft, and Sun-Oracle and IBM were working really hard to make sure that the two sides of the ecosystem had seamless experience. But if you were \"outside\" of those two stacks you were in for subtle bugs.\n\nHowever, I worked on projects that were Java and .NET, and for us it was pretty awesome. When you needed to connect two services the two teams would sit down, design a WSDL file, and then our tools would generate both client and server code *and test stubs* so we could test (or run) the rest of the application without having the other service running. Both languages had top tier IDEs, so if, say you wanted to load patient appointments you'd fire up the autocomplete, and it would find types for requests and response messages, data validators, etc.\n\nIf you find something missing you'd ring up the other team, you would agree to changes to WSDL, and then both teams would regenerate code and the IDE would instantly highlight all places where the code was broken. I worked on a medical project like this at some point, and the teams of dozens of developers (both Java and .NET) worked on individual services for months without actually running the full system ever (That was the time before CI was widespread). We finally had a demo scheduled, we connected the real endpoints, and you would think it all would brow up spectacularly. But no! The stuff actually worked! Our WSDLs had thousands of lines in them, and we had, like, 5 functions where things didn't work as expected (people passing wrong IDs or assuming different time zones, you know the drill.).\n\nSo, all things considered, it was a pretty cool set of tech. The devil was in a details. Despite everything, XML was annoying to work with, the generated types may have fields with stupid names (`field1`, `field2`, or `meaningfulName0` or something). If you wanted to debug this code you'd have to send XMLs with a tool called SOAP UI (it's like Postman, but much worse and in Java). Messages had a lot of wrapper tags with XML namespaces in them and tons of unnecessary meta-info. Both Sun and Microsoft insisted that the best way to make some classes in your favorite language, and then let *them* generate WSDL, all the tutorials showed that, and not how to work with WSDL-first approach. So people who were excited about how simple it looked in the examples were in for a very rude awakening. All in all, it was a very strong tech on a \"strategic\" level, but day-to-day as a single engineer on one of those projects you didn't really enjoyed it, and I can easily see how people would say it was PITA! Especially, those who worked with it in its earlier years when half of things it promised didn't really work. I remember at the time I was not a fan of WS and SOAP at all, but over the years and looking back I started to appreciate it more.\n\nWith gRPC Google took the main idea: have a protocol defined in a spec file (new WSDL), and use code gen for every language. They improved a lot of stuff: the new spec file format - proto - is much nicer, it works with a lot more languages, there's a lot less ceremony and special tools involved. But they also made a few decisions to make the whole thing annoying in its own way. Like, making it binary only which is bad for observability, require an exotic transport, having web browser support as an afterthought, etc. So, while objectively I liked my time with SOAP *somewhat* I'm not really rushing to try gRPC.\n\nFunny thing: SOAP was not the first either, before that we had CORBA and DCOM in the 90s and some proprietary stuff from Unix vendors in the 80s. And like every other thing in our profession RPC, too, was invented at Xerox. [The guy who coined the term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Jay_Nelson) even came up with the general design: have a file for interface definition, use it to generate stubs, all messages and RPC calls are type-checked to prevent bugs.",

I’d suggest you follow a proper roadmap for your coding journey—whether you want to become a web developer, AI developer, or pursue something else in IT. Having a clear direction will definitely help you stay motivated.\n\nAlso, if there’s anyone in your circle studying the same field, build a healthy relationship with them. Discuss your challenges and showcase your work to each other. Share your goals and work hard together—it really makes a difference.\n\nI’ve experienced this myself. My cousin and I started learning web development together. We motivate each other, and now we’re doing quite well. In fact, we’re participating in a hackathon coming up in two weeks!\n\n(OPTIONAL) If you can maintain discipline while learning from YouTube or other online platforms (and avoid distractions), you may skip this. Otherwise, consider joining a course together. It’s a great way to find like-minded people and get support for your problems.\n\nNote: Everything said in this message is my own life experience. Nothing made up. You have to make the decision.\n\n\nHope that helps and Good luck.",

There is nothing to install to serve the app and no 3d party frontend networks needed, one instance (from one dupe on my server) can serve at least 50k users without performance issues, so (amount of servers x 50-100) x 50k is technically how many concurrent users can be connected at any given time. \n\nDeviating from that is a tough sale.",

Put away as much money as you can, and the biggest choice there is the house that you rent/buy and the car that you intend to drive. I would avoid thinking that you make X and therefore you should buy a house that corresponds to X. \n\nNow it may turn out that things in the US stabilize, especially if some court cases start going against Trump and we make it to the midterms.

I started obsessively documenting everything I learn and build. If others can understand the problem, they can solve it. \n\n3. Finding the right team culture matters more than the paycheck. Search for jobs that respect work life balance. A service like Applyre might be helpful here. I took a slight pay cut for a team that genuinely respects work-life balance.\n\nTech doesn't have to be a trap.

It's critical you learn to handle this cause it'll keep happening if you don't.\n\n1) Meditation, do it 30 minutes a day every single day.  Unplug, turn off your phone, no computer alerts, no tv, just meditate for 30 minutes every day.  Look up some videos how to if you don't know yet.\n\n2) Go into nature at least 1 day a week ideally but if you can take a walk in nature multiple days a week that's even better.\n\n3) You shouldn't be on-call all the time, there should be a rotation at the company.  If there isn't an on-call rotation, find another company cause the one you're in is toxic and unhealthy or if you have some seniority implement an on-call rotation and refuse to be available when it's not your day/week.\n\nThese are the strategies I use to manage it.

Write some design docs and work independently on a few projects that last for more than a quarter that meaningfully land and you've basically hit all the requirements. You could get delayed by six months because of budget stuff but in general it's not bad. Promotions to L5 and especially L6+ have become *way* messier in the past two years. Strict budgets and a requirement for \"business need\" means that a lot of qualified people are being rejected for these promos, creating a glut in the next cycle and ultimately stalling a lot of careers. One piece of good news is that you can stay at L4 forever at Google without a problem, so getting over this hurdle isn't mandatory.\n\nA lot of managers at Google were originally engineers first. Usually the path is getting promoted to L5 or L6 first, demonstrating effective leadership and communication skills, and then having a nearby opening for a manager position that you can fill. In the past this used to be easier because headcount growth meant that \"we need a new manager to deal with the five new people we are hiring\" was pretty common. Now the most likely path is that a nearby manager quits and you are available to replace them.\n\nThis could conceivably change in the future, but from the inside the cultural change at Google feels permanent (at least while Sundar is CEO). \n\n10 years of experience and getting a L3 offer seems odd. I'd expect 10YOE to get interviewed for L5 and potentially downleveled to L4, but it sounds like maybe you were interviewed at L4 and did so-so on the interviews so you got downleveled to L3.",

Generally I’m almost always against mode leveling (especially senior to non-senior or staff to senior) because it’s so hard to make it up.\n\nHowever, I think in this case if you can make up the money difference, your current company isn’t high prestige, job stability isn’t great there etc, It might be worth at least considering though it sounds like they’re trying to drop you two levels rather than one. Sounds a bit crazy to me but then again Google is barely interviewing or hiring so if you get an offer these days it’s so rare it may be difficult to pass up.\n\nSpecifically to your question:\nThe L3 level is really entry level or a couple years at a small company. Again, I’m really surprised that’s what they’re offering but I guess it’s due to low hiring. As a result, the expectation to make it to L4 is there and it can be done fairly fast. Essentially L3 separated the new employees who are really struggling and need supervision from folks that can get a task that could take a couple months within a larger project, plan and document, launch it. Etc. it’s about independence. Doubt you’d have a problem there\n\nL4 to L5 (senior) is much more tricky due to needing the right project, having leadership, quotas, etc, but I’ve seen it done in as low as 2-3 years from L3. As long as you show you can lead a project managers will give you a chance as soon as they can. These promotions are in org so if leadership perceives you as a lead that got downleveled you’d get more opportunities\n\nFeel free to PM if you have questions",

A downlevel is staying within the same role.\n\nThe reason downleveling isn't normally a big deal is because all companies treat titles differently. So going from a Senior SWE at Company A to a SWE 2 at Company B isn't some sort of demotion, it's just Company B saying according to their internal titles you fall under a SWE 2. You're still a SWE at the end of the day, doing the same SWE stuff, just with a different arbitrary title next to your name. Sure there's traditionally some difference between a Senior SWE and a non-Senior SWE, but what Company B is communicating is you don't meet that difference at *their* company, so still no change.\n\nBut what you're describing is a full on role change. You are going from being a manager, to being a SWE. The roles are inherently different.\n\nI don't know anything about Google's internal processes so can't comment on that, but if your career goal is to be a manager, changing from a manager role down to a SWE role is not going to be beneficial, and if anything it'll look bad on your resume. Sure Google has massive hiring prestige, but they hired you as a SWE, not a manager. Who knows how long it'll take before Google puts you into a management role. Who knows if they'll *ever* put you into a management role.\n\nIf being a manager is your goal, I would continue looking until I found a manager role.\n\nJust like if being a SWE was my goal, and a company offered me an IT position, I would keep looking until I found a SWE role.",

I had nothing to lose so you can do that sometimes. \n\n2nd interview - COO is involved.. Very open honest discussion, great discussion. Dude knew I achieved what I wanted in EHS, looking for an opportunity into business side (non-ehs), was bored, etc. \n\nHe tells me I am overqualified and that I am better than Safety. While some may have gotten offended, I did not because I agree lol. Nothing against my EHS brothers/sisters.. I just have always been bored and found it not challenging enough (I am director level currently). He was just spot on with everything and we were just starting to converse.. At this point, my interviews are not your typical \"give me a time you had to use decision making in a high-stress situation\" but more conversational, management style, personality assessing, etc.  At least in my experience the last 2 job changes. \n\nI get rejected, but while being rejected for role I interviewed for, they tell me there is another opportunity that they would love to discuss with me if still interested. I checked their website to see what jobs were listed, and it was only a handful and none of them would match any I would fill. I believe the COO I connected with is throwing me a lifeline for a career change. They know how much I currently make and that I would not take less (3 small kids, wife to support), but he must have seen or heard something that caused him to throw me a potential bone and transition into a new career. I am very much looking forward to learning more, but it feels good that this even happened and that my skills and abilities are easily recognized by the C-Suite in at least one company lol\n\nGreat post OP.. Glad I am not the only one going through this! I have never been in a situation like it so hoping I make the right decision.",

The only legal \"out\" to an accommodation request would be a claim by the employer that your accommodation was \"unreasonable\".

That means she’s probably already aware something is wrong with them and is looking for you to help come up with solutions or at least help identify what they’re doing wrong. If you need extra resources or to change the roadmap or need her to back you up on process changes, my guess is that’s all on the table, but she’s looking for your guidance and some semblance of a plan. Going back to her and just saying “this team sucks” isn’t helpful to anyone.\n\nIf I was your manager and you came back to me and said, “The team is broken and I can’t fix it. Please move me because I don’t want this on my resume.” I’d honestly be pretty pissed and it would impact our relationship. I’m looking for your help with a problem at your current job and you’re telling me no because you’re worried about your next job. If you came to me and said, “Here are the problems I see. I think we need to focus on fixing this tech debt for a while which should allow us to deliver faster in the future. If we can get one more engineer on the team I think that would help too.” That would be much more well received even if I couldn’t make that happen.\n\nVenting to your manager a little bit is fine, but most of the time if you’re bringing a problem to your manager you should also bring at least one suggestion of how to solve it. If the problem is something that they’ve explicitly asked you to help fix then having some ideas on how to fix this is almost mandatory. You can almost always bring problems to your manager as long as you frame it in a way where you’re trying to be part of a solution.",

Had they not been applying for the job, you probably would have gotten it.\n\nHaving been on the other end of hiring, sometimes, it's not an easy choice when you have multiple people who would be a really great fit in the position.  If they really liked you (which it sounds like they did), they might reach out if they have an opening that they think you'd do well in.\n\nDon't walk away looking at this as a failure.  You did your best and made some connections that might pay off later.",

You roll in around 10 am and do standup. Work for an hour then lunch for an hour. You'll stand in line for 30 minutes at a food truck if you don't go before 12. At 1 you'll work for a few hours then go home. Maybe ping pong or something once a week if you have coworkers who are into that and you want to play. That's your day. Somewhere in there you'll go get your free coffee and a banana and think about working at a company that isn't so cheap.\n\nAs you get promoted, there are more and more meetings with every promotion and you get involved in all kinds of random email/slack threads but you're also expected to get as much coding done as the L4s.\n\nMost everything depends on your team and manager. Your manager has a very large role in your happiness and how horrible your deadlines are and your team will make it fun + help you... or they won't and you'll cry yourself to sleep because you can't figure anything out. Difficult to tell you if it will be good or not.\n\nYou should pick waymo tbh. Amazon's mandatory firing bucket and current layoff outlook has had a corrosive effect on the culture and if you have a good option, you should go there.",

In reality I was more of a Database Administrator working with Content Manager On Demand (CMOD) and using Mainframe. It was demoralizing and NOT what I had envisioned working as a Software Engineer. In fact this company was handing the software projects to Chinese interns who would end up leaving and just go back to China. Huge shame. \n\nAt the turn of Spring that year I worked at Miller Knoll on the line which was exhausting and difficult. I quit that and then picked up a Gas Station job at Speedway and worked there for 6 months. \n\nRemind you this is all while having a Computer Science degree with 4 internships under my belt. I applied to just above 450 or so jobs and would get from those around 12 call backs and only 1 offer. It was demoralizing. By some miracle a company only 5 minutes away from my home called me for an interview through a  recruiter and I ended up acquiring the job! I couldn’t be blessed enough. I am learning so much about the ASP.NET ecosystem . The major downside of this job whoever is the pay. I make around $57,000 in Michigan which is considered on the super low side of things. But I feel you in terms of wanting that pay raise and moving up : ( the ladder. I want to gain some more experience after a year or two and try to negotiate a pay raise but if my employer won’t budge then I will probably look around for another position that will pay me more. \n\nDon’t give up!",

In consulting company we often work with governments especially state governments. Every time I go on site, I am jealous of the work and office environment compared to what we had.

When there are events outside of it, it's not some company wide curated event in disguise to make you work longer hours. I feel the barrier between office life and personal life is much more respected.\n\nThe other thing I like is the lax dress code. The previous company was very strict about dress code even on casual Fridays which just means you can wear jeans. I can wear anything as long as it's fine in public.\n\nWork isn't stressful and as mentally exhausting. Tech may not be the most cutting edge. As I get older, I prefer to work things that won't make me mentally exhausted when I get home. Things did heat up a bit during and after the pandemic, but still comparatively less stressful.\n\nWork in many different domains that can be transferable to even non tech jobs.\n\nJob security, S tier health benefits, and pension.

Anyone can pick that stuff up, junior or senior, and it doesn't increase your value as an engineer on its own.\n\nYour value as an engineer comes from your ability to solve hard, impactful problems of increasing scope, complexity, and ambiguity. \n\nScope has to do with how large a task is and how long it takes. Junior engineers work on small tasks that only take a few days or weeks. Senior engineers work on large multi-month deliverables.\n\nComplexity has to do with how tricky the actual task is. I work in video streaming. A junior engineer might work on something like \"fix this tiny bug in the encoding module.\" A senior engineer might work on something like \"design and implement a scalable transcoding pipeline for <x> use case.\"\n\nAmbiguity has to do with how well-defined the task is. A junior engineer would work on something that's really obvious, clear, and requires very little clarification. A senior engineer might be given a vague problem statement like \"our video transcode pipeline is too slow. Go fix it.\" or \"We need <x> feature, figure it out.\", and the onus is on them to dissect that request into actionable, concrete technical tasks for the team to work on.\n\nThe more you focus on these three things, the better an engineer you become.\n\nRead [DropBox's technical career guide.](https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/ic1_software_engineer.html) It goes into even more detail than this, at all levels from junior to director.\n\nNote that *nothing* in the guide mentions *any* of the things in your post.

And being bored at work could easily make you feel kinda burned out, or lethargic, or like the spark is gone.\n\nI resonate with this a lot, because 3 years is about the point where I start getting bored on a team. The easiest way to cure this is to have a candid conversation with your manager, and see if they can either find you some different work, or transfer you onto a different team.\n\nDoing that usually reignites the spark for me. The longest I've lasted at one company is a little over 5 years, and the main reason I lasted that long was I switched teams after 3 years. Switching teams gave me a ton of new stuff to learn, it was in an entirely different tech stack, I had to learn all the business knowledge from scratch. It's fun, everything's new again. It's shoving you back into the \"honeymoon stage\".\n\nMy new grad company was actually great with this. They *encouraged* internal moves at the 2 year mark for all employees. For me specifically it just sorta happened naturally, I worked on 3 different teams across 3.5 years. The only reason I left them was because I wanted to live on the east coast, otherwise I could've stayed there for life. And some of my friends have, I think there's 5 or so people from my new grad cohort that are still at that company, 12 years later.\n\nSo that's what I'd recommend. See if you can transfer internally, or get a completely new type of work. If you can't, start looking for a new job .See if that fixes things for you. If it doesn't, then maybe you're right, this industry just isn't a good fit for you... but the fact you found your job rewarding *at first* makes me think you're just bored rather than being burnt out of the entire industry.",

As always with the US, the social services are lacking compared to Europe, though if you get a high paying job with great benefits, that difference is mostly mitigated\n2. Education in the Boston area is excellent, rivaling the Nordic countries\n3. Public transit is acceptable but easily the worst out of the 3 cities you’re considering, bike infrastructure kind of sucks, but the city itself is supremely walkable\n4. Boston is not a late night city, restaurants and bars often close quite early compared to other similar cities\n5. Most of the neighborhoods in Boston feel meaningfully distinct from one another, it’s something I love about the city but you should definitely shop around for a neighborhood you like before deciding where to live\n6. Food is good, not great for a city of its size - beer scene is arguably the best in the country though\n7. Quick access to New York via Amtrak is awesome\n8. As you noted, Boston is probably the safest major American city and rivals many European cities\n9. No shade, and I’m obviously biased, but I really prefer New Englanders to other Americans and Northern Europeans. I feel New Englanders are the perfect mix of being pretty friendly and kind without being obnoxious or fake about it\n10. Speaking of which, New England itself is awesome. Great vacation or long weekend opportunities all over the place for all seasons\n11. Boston is easily the coldest and hottest/most humid of the cities you’re considering, but it also gets the most sunlight. I prefer Boston winters to Berlin winters even though Berlin doesn’t get as cold\n12. The rental and buying market in Boston sucks, but I’m not sure it’s better in the other cities you’re considering\n13. Boston is absolutely the most “European-feeling” of the major American cities, but it’s still definitely an American city at its core.",

Chances of you landing a Google position from the getgo are slim too with the recent downsizing and hiring in cheaper locations.\n\n> Also, I’d have to learn swiss german, and my children would have to go to school and speak swiss german.

Aside from checking that you had a degree it wouldn't jump out, I work with a lot of top 10 school folks, I came from a relatively unknown school, your experience is going to matter more than your schooling when it comes to getting a job. That said..\n\nIf you've got all the options in the world the connections and quality of education you'll get at a place like MIT, CMU, Harvard, Berkeley, Stanford etc.. are going to serve you very well in life but if those are not an option then getting a degree at all in a manner that you'll actually finish is the most important thing.",

I would focus on one or two, have them hosted so their viewable by the employer and be able to talk through them.

You can apply for analyst positions right now but you’re probably better off going for help desk unless you’ve done a security focused internship.

No one knows who you are, you can't just DM account managers and solicit for work, companies have contractual agreements.\n\nYou end up with small projects by networking or and building a name for yourself and then people with their small businesses don't want to sign contracts or pay you. You can go on Fiverr and get paid but not enough to live on unless you're lucky or famous. You live in India where 1000 euros or dollars a month is middle class, you can do it.\n\nStill probably a bad idea. My hail corporate resume of companies you've heard of looks a whole lot better than a freelancer's taking risks for variable pay, with level of clients and scale of work are beneath my own. Being your own boss is overrated. If you scale up, most businesses fail.\n\n>Should I start looking for big companies to work for, to build up reputation? \n\nYes and don't leave. Or learn how to run a business, save up money and make industry contacts and try to start your own consulting firm. In the US, I'd recommend an MBA. You're not the freelancer doing the grunt work, you're the owner or account manager delegating to the grunts and freelancers. Be on the other side of the hustle.\n\n>Is it enough to continue building a portfolio with private freelance projects\n\nDon't do that. Every job offer I sign the contract for has a clause that forbids outside work without approval. It's not enough money compared my salary broken down per hour anyway. Stick to work experience. Ask for more work if you want. Just me but I find after a fulltime software job, the last thing I want to do is go home and code more for a hobby or for pay.

Experience in the markets the business is targeting (healthcare, additive manufacturing, law, etc), the model by which the business operates (SaaS, PaaS, b2b, b2c, etc), and domain expertise over the product/market (peripherals, infrastructure, HRIS/ERP/EHR/etc), is king.\n\n> I was considering MBA but then I came across LinkedIn profiles of people who shifted to Prod roles of different companies without an MBA.\n\nThose people probably have heaps of experience in one or all of the areas I described above.\n\nTo be clear, \"I worked for a SaaS vendor\" does not automatically mean you understand the full lifecycle of sales, support, adoption, and development of a SaaS product. Cranking out Jira issues is not the same as sitting in contract negotiations with a big client, producing estimates/SOWs, planning/executing a multi-month/year implementation across multiple functional groups (sales, support/training, development, etc), planning a launch to expand/capture a market segment, dealing with a pissed off customer because milestones are slipping, etc.\n\nMy experience prior to moving into product management in my current org was in b2b sales/contracting of IaaS and managed services as an owner/operator. That's roughly the same model and domain I work in currently. I had practically no prior experience in my org's specific market segment but picked that knowledge up over ~2 years as a software engineer and ~3 as an engineering manager at my current org.\n\nProduct management as a functional role should be pretty consistent among your F-100s and FAANGs. But it's going to vary wildly between practically any other company. Product management as a discipline is very much a YMMV thing.\n\n> Can someone guide? Are there any certifications or courses that companies consider in place of an MBA.\n\n[Pragmatic](https://www.pragmaticinstitute.com/), [PMI](https://www.pmi.org/), and [IIBA](https://www.iiba.org/) all have certification programs which bear some weight.

        "body": "Congrats, it's hard to land something like this these days. Your hard work paid off.\n\nIt's a tough choice to have to make, especially without any experience to tell you what you like.\n\nRemember that literally all of those options lead to interesting, deep careers that offer solid job satisfaction, good working conditions and I imagine importantly for you a respectable salary.\n\nYour choice should be based on what you think is interesting to you. If you like the idea of being a \"systems architect\" later in your career then you want to find work that lets you get experience building and rolling out distributed systems. You'll find plenty of large projects like this being built and deployed as either a Software Engineer (assuming you go backend) or to a lesser extent an Infrastructure Engineer (roles called this can vary wildly between companies, but you'll generally be working with more technical problems with less business context if you take this role at jpmc). \n\nPersonally, I've seen plenty of Software Engineers doing infra at jpmc, so as I see it the title is more a consequence of what your area does rather than your role on the team.",

        "body": "amazing insight, cheers. It's a bit convoluted but I was very loosely told infrastructure engineering is the starting role and then in the 3rd and 4th year ill be a system architecture apprentice if I choose to take that role (due to how the university of exeter structures it's course) meaning that if offered a graduate role it would be straight away a system architect role which seems absolutely phenomenal to start my career in such a good role. But from the sound of what you're saying I'd have enough exposure to consider architecture anyway with SWE so I think I'll take SWE due to having an overall broader scope.\n\nThanks!",
