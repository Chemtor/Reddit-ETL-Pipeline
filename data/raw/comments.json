He was an MBA who got dumped on the data team because he was the CFO's buddy who had fucked up one too many times on the finance team.\n\nThings he did while managing the small data team:\n\n1. Set up the initial infrastructure as a single prod database that read directly in from sources. No stage, no transformation layer, just source straight into prod. No backups either, and he thought backups were an extra expense we didn't need.\n2. Stored patient phone numbers and zip codes as numbers, dropping all leading zeroes for about four months' data until he put that into a reporting table and freaked out about why so many rows were wrong.\n3. After fixing the phone number issue, he decided to use phone numbers as a patient table's primary key, \n4. This is my all-time favorite: he put unhashed SSNs in a table that was fed into Tableau, so that all of our practice administrators could see the SSNs of all the patients across all of our practices. *Huge* security issue.\n5. Lied about a dozen times on a questionnaire about security practices for a data sharing deal the company wanted to do with BCBS. We were incredibly lucky that our privacy officer caught that on the way out and corrected things, although she ended up being the one who took the heat when BCBS said \"Oh *hell* no\" to the deal after seeing how sketchy things were.",

Avoid trying to load the whole thing into memory at the same time and it shouldn't take too long even without parallelizing it.\n\nIf you can filter rows based on a filter that only accesses a small number of the 400 available features, do that as often as possible so you don't waste compute trying to parse the entire line (all 400 features) for every row. Your goal should be to expose your CPU and RAM to as few rows and columns as possible. It will take some knowledge of the data distribution on how to do that most efficiently.",

Managing 100+ metrics across multiple tools without a single unified view becomes a governance nightmare. Each tool ends up with slightly different calculations, and nobody knows which version is the correct one. A semantic layer gives you one source of truth.\n\nBut don't you need to derive the data that's going to provide this unified view? Doesn't that involve precisely the calculations that drift apart over time? So what's the semantic layer doing other than adding yet another bunch of transformation?\n\n> The key is the semantic logic layer, abstracting the physical world from the modeling world.\n\nThat sounds like horseshit to me. Both layers are abstractions, both layers are models, neither layer is physical - or rather, both layers are supported by physical hardware and eventually boil down to fluctuating voltages and so they're both physical in that sense, but neither is any more physical than the other. The question isn't whether one level of abstraction is more physical than the other, but what the new abstraction provides that the old one didn't and whether it makes life easier.",

You can store things in columns such as ID - Atrribute Name - Attribute value without flattening them, which makes ingestion transparent. Or you maintain link tables and cross referentials, without having to decide upfront what the precise grain is\n\nSo your gold layer can be:\n\n* the PowerBi datamodel, Tableau view or anything an analyst generates directly\n* a curated layer specifically for a consumer (Marketing datamart, Sales datamart on another grian, pre-aggregated finance figures to show year to date on the book year, ...)\n* views or tables designed to be consumed by a specific consumer, such as pre-filtered reports or tables that generate a daily outbound file to be consumed by another tool\n\nThis may not be \"by the book\", but this is what I've always seen in practice",

Yes, this is my personal pet peeve. </rant>\n\nWhen you start joining things for the semantic layer, you are assigning purpose to them. For example, if you create a star, how you join the dimensions to the fact table gives meaning (explicit or implicit) to the data that may not be true in all instances. Those data products are meant to keep your core available for all purposes and not any specific one. That being said, you could query to the core layer directly, but it may not perform as well as the semantic layer. The core is more about the relationships of the data at an overall business layer.

They‚Äôre vastly underestimated and require dedicated resources, which should include a project manager, business stakeholders, and engineer(s). \n\nThe worst project? A migration with no validation, a lack of business user validation, and/or a rushed timeline. Projects without validation are almost always dead on arrival. The exception being an incredibly straight forward system (with low customization) that you‚Äôve handled multiple times. I can tell within the first three months if it‚Äôs going to flop based on business users lack of engagement and/or validation. \n\nYou could do everything right as far as schema to schema and wind up with the destination enterprise software handling the end result poorly due to rules represented outside the schema (or api) definitions. \n\nEven something as simple as moving files is often overlooked in data migrations between systems, which can range from super straight forward PDFs to custom templates you need to rebuild by passing data into. File type compatibility issues, number of files per record and representation of those files on the front-end, file size limits, etc. \n\nThe fact you‚Äôre doing migrations straight into production without validation rounds (using production data) raises a üö©for a potential long term headache.

This isn't always possible, but I run into a ton of teams that think that as long as a job is batch performance doesn't matter.  They're not thinking about cost, usability benefits of lower latency, or deployment/fix implications of their slow batch jobs.\n   * Missing bells & whistles: simple logging & alerting is fairly easy to address, monitoring can be more, but also driven off logging, etc, etc.\n\nSo, if I ran into a team that wanted to show results fast, this is what they knew, and wanted to defer for a bit trying to figure out best way to run jobs, I wouldn't be too concerned about this approach.",

This experience was a catalyst for my professional growth.\n\nIn that role, **PySpark** was our main framework. We used it to build scalable ETL/ELT pipelines capable of processing massive datasets efficiently. For orchestration, we relied on **Apache Airflow**, which was a game-changer for automating and monitoring our data workflows.\n\nTo manage our code and documentation, we used **GitHub** and **GitLab**. This ensured that our development process was organized, collaborative, and easy to track. For data analysis and validation, I used **Hue** to run queries and visualize data directly on our Hadoop cluster. And for database administration, **DBeaver** was my go-to tool for managing both **MySQL** and **Oracle** environments.\n\nThis exposure to a modern, integrated tech stack was invaluable. It not only deepened my technical skills but also prepared me for the demands of the current job market.\n\n\n\n# > Is It a Bad Career Choice to Stay?\n\nYes, in terms of professional growth, it absolutely is. Your current role is a maintenance position that doesn't challenge you or equip you with the skills needed to be competitive in the modern data engineering field. You're not building new solutions or working with the tools that most companies are using.\n\n\n\n# > Would You Take a Pay Cut to Leave This Situation?\n\nYes, I would. A pay cut is not a loss; it's an investment in your future. Accepting a lower-paying job that uses modern technologies will significantly increase your market value in a few years. Think of it this way: a small short-term loss in salary could lead to a much larger long-term gain in earning potential.\n\nGiven that you're in your early 30s, you have plenty of time to pivot. Use your current low-stress environment to your advantage. Take the time to study and build personal projects using tools like **PySpark**, **Apache Airflow**, and cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure. By actively building this experience, you can turn a potentially stagnating situation into a stepping stone for a dynamic and rewarding career.",

        "body": "Obviously, great work if you did that alone without much DE experience beforehand. I guess a few points to consider:\n\n1. How will the pipeline behave if the UI changes on the website you are pulling the data from, or if the website is down or behaving slowly? In my own experience, Selenium is quite limited to basic actions like ‚Äúwait for page to load‚Äù or ‚Äúwait until the export button appears.‚Äù I would assume you, as a BI Analyst, would probably know when the UI change happens since you are closer to the business user. But still, you don‚Äôt (at least you have not mentioned it) have any sort of monitoring or alerting and are just relying on everything working smoothly. So I would advise thinking about adding logging and alerts for those cases.\n2. Again, this kind of follows the second point, but it would probably make sense to add some retry logic when pulling the data if the website is slow on that particular day.\n3. Raw data is usually pretty fucking bad, and it‚Äôs the task of a Data Engineer to make the business see only pretty fucking good data. What I mean by that is: do you have any validation in place to prevent bad data from getting into your Power BI models? You mentioned you are pulling customer data profiles and geolocations, and this kind of data is soooo easy to get messed up - it‚Äôs insane. For example, postal codes being bad, or missing pieces of an address, like the street being available but not the city, etc. So I would think about adding some sort of validation for your data, if it‚Äôs not already part of the transformations you are doing.\n4. You are pulling the Excel files, applying and saving them, and then reading them and saving as parquet. Why? Literally, no offense, but why? You have two versions of the same file in different file formats stored. I would probably store the raw Excel files somewhere for archival purposes so that if you need to check the raw data, you don‚Äôt need to re-download them. But I would store transformed files directly in parquet to avoid unnecessary reads/writes.\n5. Create/replace tables is a simple, working strategy, which is cool, but really inefficient for big tables since you have to reload everything. I would suggest checking out `MERGE` or `INSERT...ON CONFLICT` statements for incremental updates so that if a row is unchanged from the previous table version, you don‚Äôt need to reload it. Also, I assume your SQL commands look like: `CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT * FROM 'file1.parquet';` Which is normal, but I would advise wrapping it in transaction logic. What does this mean? Imagine your tables fail in the middle, and you have 10 tables. Now you are stuck with 5 updated and 5 old tables - sucks, right? To ensure that your group of loading operations is atomic (meaning they either all succeed or all fail together), you must manually wrap them in a transaction block. That way, you know for sure that either all of them were updated, or all of them are in their previous state, but the data is still consistent between them.\n\nAgain, what you did is really solid, especially for your first time, but maybe my wall of text will help you a bit. I am also open to any comments since I suck at DE and maybe messed up somewhere. Be very proud of what you designed.",

This avoids constant vacuum churn from doing small upserts, and you still get perf. If you need point in time queries, keep the bronze and build a silver that is deduped by key and day.\n\nDo you need only latest or point in time? Do deletes happen a lot or rare? How big are the hot tables and what is the 95p change rate?\n\nIf you opt for the \"zero-ETL\" approach, for organization, keep your data in S3 partitioned like `s3://your-bucket/db_name/table_name/dt=YYYY/MM/DD/hr=HH/`. That layout plays nice with Redshift Spectrum and makes pruning way more effective when you're querying or loading batches. Helps a ton with downstream compaction and dedup too, since you can scope it to a smaller time window instead of scanning everything.\n\nDedup pattern is primary key plus Debezium ts\\_ms or source commit lsn, with a tie breaker on op where create beats update beats delete. Partitioning matters for both Spectrum pruning and for batch merge windows, so compact small stuff like five minute files into larger hour files.\n\nAlternatively, if you want a no fuss route, Estuary can land CDC into Redshift with append only and handle dedupe and merges cleanly.

It's constant learning, even as an experienced engineer, whenever I switched to a new stack, I needed between one and two years to be proficient at the local stack and the local software. Good engineering managers know that and will mostly expect you to demonstrate that you are proactively learning by asking questions and reaching out to seniors to get help.\n\nIf you're good at SQL and have some experience with proper software engineering (git), dbt should be easy for you to pick up in a couple of weeks. Just follow their guides and best practices to make sure you use it correctly and in a way that is easy to follow by another dbt user.  \nSnowflake is probably the best hands-off OLAP distributed database, if you're good at SQL, there should be no difficulty. As with any data processing tool, the key is to focus on their documentation about optimizing query performance (partitioning, clustering...).\n\nSo, the learning is not going to be a problem, I think the hardest is going to be passing the selection in the current market.",

Most companies need automation more than the latest tech and tools.\n\n>Has anyone gone through something similar?\n\nSelf taught across 6-8 months, so a lot less experienced than yourself, and went straight into a DE role.  Learning on the job was very fair in my first role because I filled a gap they needed - automation and modernisation.  In an ironic way, I know I just say companies need automation more than the latest tools, however, this role was fun because my job was to learn the latest tools and see how they could be offered to clients internally and externally.\n\nAfter 18 months, I got my second job.  Learning became a lot easier because I had already seen most things before.  The same patterns crop up and it was a lot more battling very poor design decisions made by members of the team as well as external contractors although still doing the same thing.",

Do one pass to get the roster of IDs, store that set, then on each poll diff the set to find new and missing IDs.\n\nHere are a few things that worked for me in the past on similar issues: For updates, fetch in batches but avoid refetching everything every time. Keep a raw bronze table of the exact JSON per employee keyed by employee_id plus poll_time and a content_hash. If the hash changed since last poll, mark it changed and upsert into your modeled tables. If an ID disappears from the roster for a few consecutive polls, tombstone it. Add last_fetched_at and last_changed_at in your modeled table, and keep headers like ETag or Last Modified if the API gives them.\n\nStart with a tiny script using requests plus a small state store in Postgres (or just a json file), and land raw to object storage or DuckDB. Polling is still fine here, but tier it by heuristics. Recently created or recently changed IDs get polled more often, long lived records get sampled less. Backfill can be a manual trigger, then switch to a low frequency poll. This avoids full refresh while staying honest about data quality.\n\n roughly how many employees and what rate limit do you have, do you need SCD2 history or is last write wins fine, and how should deletes be represented in the warehouse?",

You can get the archetypal trope of \"Do impossible question for interview, only need `SELECT * FROM` in the job\" to getting a competency style interview where they focus more on seeing what you think.\n\n>How do I bridge the gap between tutorials and production-level knowledge?\n\nI think this is in itself a bit of a telling question when asked because it's under the impression that \"production grade\" is something magically different when it can be succinctly described as building something which isn't total shit.  How is something not total shit? It depends on the feedback from your manager and your team as long as it's constructive and makes sense rather than comments like \"I don't like it\".\n\nConceptually, most things you are going to make for a company should have the ambition to reach production, thus, it should be as complete as possible.\n\nIf it's something only you use personally, then it doesn't matter what it looks like.\n\nIf it's something somebody else will see or use, it shouldn't be shit.  It should be predictable, easy to understand and use.  Simple to make changes.  Flexible for reuse.  Testable to some degree (depends on your platform).  Observable at all required points.

Sometimes it's from scratch-ish if I'm setting up something that doesn't already exist. \n\n* Or is this task often handled by a dedicated DevOps, Cloud, or Security team, especially in larger companies?\n\nI don't know about larger companies, and even then I expect it would depend on the company. In the companies I've worked at (startups / medium) the data team had their own AWS sub-account where we could implement whatever tools/policies we wanted - the official devops folks were focused on production architecture. We definitely worked with them and did some security reviews tho. \n\n\\> Should I dive deep into the IAM JSON policy syntax, or is it more important to have a strong conceptual understanding of what permissions are needed for a pipeline, and then learn to adapt existing policies?\n\nDon't bother learning the syntax unless that's going to be 90% of your workload. Copy paste is going to be your friend, and then you can adapt as needed. Keep in mind the principle of least privilege and you'll be fine - you always start from zero and only add access to what you need. But what you need is gonna depend on what you're trying to do (read? write? etc.) Architecture is much harder than the syntax piece.",

I'm probably not following what this subreddit would consider to be best practices, but here's what I did:\n\n* Built out a Python ETL platform that allows me to generate pipelines using JSON config files. The pipelines ingest Excel files directly from our local network, transform and clean the data, and pop it into an on-prem SQL Server database. My platform is modular and extensible, so I tend to add/update functionality as needed.\n* I use dev/test/prod environments in the DB but haven't done bronze/silver/gold layers. Monitoring is manual right now (log files!) but I plan to migrate to Prefect and/or implement some Power BI dashboards that consume my logs.\n* I avoid manually-managed documentation wherever possible, because that will be the first thing to go out of date. Instead, I'm using JSON schemas and GitHub Actions to automatically generate documentation for my config files on push, and docstrings + pdoc + GitHub Actions to do the same for my codebase. Only manually-maintained documentation is the top-level README for the repo.\n* Power BI is a star for me. Getting the on-prem gateway running was painful, but I've established dev/test/prod environments where I control access. Users can access the dashboards via Teams or, in some cases, export the semantic models to Excel for further analysis. I'm also using PBIB files so I can manage dev in GitHub.\n\nIn terms of general approach, I would start slow and be responsive. Full-stack data analysis means you're also your own PM, so be sure to communicate well and be able to justify your choices to stakeholders. Figure out your P0 items that are crucial for what you're building and then go build it. As you work on this, you'll naturally identify new concerns and priorities and be able to respond to those. Having a vision for what you want to do will help you build for the future--for example, I want to manage my configs via a website, so I established JSON schema rules that unlocked automated documentation--but your vision should remain flexible.\n\nGood luck!\n\n(Edit: Formatting)",

You may be able to implement this with your ingestion pipeline. \n\nHowever, it seems like the next logical step is to get an actual database, like Postgres or SQL Server so that you can do indexing and schema enforcement. Then, design an API to push data to the database and ingest out of the database rather than sharepoint.\n\nIf you cannot do this, one thing that might help is to implement data validation within the xls files. That should at least help with people doing things like entering the wrong data type.",

We have detected that if there were cancelled/refunded orders on 29th/30th/31st, the total revenue of last month taken on 1st day is different than taking the total revenue on 3rd/4th day, where all the updates of the orders status should have been done already.\n\nI guess I am thinking about the \"true\" values that should exist on the database and in the API itself? I am sorry if I cannot explain it that good\n\n  \n`what practical or business needs require a report that only needs to be updated once per month`\n\nRight. I am new to the job and this is a report requested from me by the team lead.

Home page items are the most popular items and the best selling products are the top performers in revenue -- they could have some overlap.\n\nThe once-per-month refresh is only on this report alone, but the rest of the reports being asked are all standard.",

        "body": "You are going about it in a weird way. Go back to your management and convince them to apply the concept of an analytics window. \n\nI have worked on this problem multiple times already, most notably with logistics. It‚Äôs the same concept with deliveries in that open orders on the last few days of the month will only be closed many days after. My advice is that you get the highest possible time that the order is closed, use that as your window, and only calculate by then. This is similar to intra-day calcs where hourly measures have maybe a window of a few minutes, a variance expectation, and an end-of-day resolution via batch job. \n\nAs an example: if closing an order takes 4 days maximum like in your case, then calculate your close rate on the morning of the 5th. Basically, you‚Äôve given all open orders from the previous month the appropriate waiting time to close. This way, you can properly report on them already.\n\nWhat of the still open orders by then? Consider them unresolved. This is an analytical tradeoff your management should accept on a monthly basis. If they find this problematic, then do multiple checkpoints: an initial view a day after the month (highest number of open orders), a view after the initial window, i.e. T+5, and a view maybe 2 weeks after. At that point, you should be able to have extreme confidence in your data. Variance should be very low, except in extreme outlier circumstances.\n\nIf revenue is being tracked using this order system, well‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre doing it wrong. Or rather your company is doing it wrong. They should be doing that off of your invoice system, not your analytical data. It can be a placeholder, sure, but nothing says money earned as well as money that actually arrived in the bank etc. The best you SHOULD tell your stakeholders is that this is estimated revenue from orders and that it is not indicative of actual money coming in. That is for the finance department to resolve, not yours. You‚Äôre a data engineer. And unless your name is Harry, you‚Äôre most probably not a wizard either.\n\nOverall, your approach can be solved by educating your stakeholder/client/management and reaching a compromise with them. Otherwise, you are in for a world of pain.",

The concepts transfer between clouds pretty well. Being a wizard in GCP because you got to use it daily is going to beat out being a complete junior in AWS because you only got to toy with it in personal demo environments. \n\nPast that, I‚Äôd prioritize AWS just because the developer community around it is so strong. 6/10 tutorials for building things in the cloud are going to be done in AWS.

Good data engineering benefits from a perspective that plants trees you'll probably not enjoy the shade of. \n\nComment your code with intent, explain the reason why you are doing what you are doing in that moment in documentation and note when you are doing the same thing multiple times. When you first start it is often easy to build something that works initially but is ultimately not going to scale or isn't maintainable. Learning from those times helps you think about the bigger picture and understand the true scope of a given ask. \n\n\nExample: the company is recording things in Excel files and they want you to make some of the data available in a consolidated dashboard. You could just grab the specific data/fields from the files and write them to a database then point a dashboard to it. That would fulfill the request but then in 6 months they realize they want other data from those old Excel files and you need to reprocess them again to get the rest of the data. \n\nWhereas if at the start you consider the durability of the files and potential future needs vs. Cost of storage you may have taken everything from those files. Then when the ask for more of the data eventually comes you can provide the data in a fraction of the time and you've ensured that everything is backed up in case some accidentally deletes a source file.",

On one hand, you will have access to unlimited opportunities, use cases and business problems you can take on and go after yourself.

You CAN eat until you throw up. But you must love the interim experience upto the point of throwing up in the metaphor. \n\nIn terms of learning and growth, don‚Äôt expect someone to hold your hand, or build you a structured learning path or tell you what to do or how to do it. YOU are going to be doing all of that for yourself. \n\nLastly, you will need to have a very high tolerance for frustration and lack of documented information, well defined standards and processes, crystal clear priorities and just pain overall. If you get frustrated easily because the business requirement wasn‚Äôt clear for you to immediately start coding your data pipeline or SQL query, then startups aren‚Äôt a viable place to work for you. \n\nHaving said all of that, you WILL NOT find a more buzzing, lively and exciting opportunity to work and learn. It‚Äôs the same kind of thrill people get when going on those super risky rides, knowing that you might fall from the sky but the adrenaline rush of doing one is rewarding enough to go for it.

I haven't yet read the former but am reading through the latter. It's definitely a complicated book as it greatly goes into detail on different paradigms and applications. In fact, it may be a bit too dense too soon; either beforehand, or as they arrive, I would also look into tools that are similar to what your company is using. Learn what the differences are and try to understand why one may have decided to go with your current stack, and why one might want to move away from it.\n\nLastly, for now, I stress paying attention to soft skills. I've been burned before being the only person at a start-up (kinda, it was complicated and I was largely separated from anyone else who may have been able to help, and they have largely different priorities). My boss had certain expectations that were tough to realize, partly because of these different priorities. I could've done better to manage them, to an extent.

If there aren't any that suit your needs then python as a first class citizen enables you to make custom processors.

You could make a pretty simple jinja template to use as a code generator, just putting the target table name and column names as params. Make that output a procedure definition, and as long as you stick to the pattern that's all you have to write manually. You should be able to automatically scrape all the parameters you need using information_schema -- the whole thing could be a single python script to automatically generate everything.\n\nYou have your spark insert to a staging table (truncate first if you don't include a partition column), then run the procedure.\n\nIf they don't want to deal with all of these objects too much, they can have a separate schema to put them in.\n\nUltimately making spark do the work if figuring out what is an insert, update, or delete, is going to be very wasteful in shuffling data back-and-forth, and you're running two sets of compute when it could be one.",

Do the upsert from staging to target, then truncate the staging.\n\nI think this would be a fairly quick way of doing what you are looking for. It also gets away from the spark use, and the JDBC issues you‚Äôll tangle with in my view.",

You've just used words from different technologies and slapped them together. \n\nFabric offer pretty much nothing that Synapse doesn't - the \"one Lake\" approach is a new feature that dilutes the whole concept of \"single source of truth\". And Fabric doesn't support data flows.\n\nSynapse is a solution for enterprise needs, it can be optimised as you'd expect for that level of usage.\n\nFabric is aimed at \"citizen\" developers, e.g. people who operate as individuals and pull reports together from different sources. The one thing fabric genuinely does better than Synapse is allows you to connect to data sources easily. It's not difficult in Synapse, it's just not very intuitive.\n\nThe easiest way to envision is it:   \n  \nData Factory does a bunch of legacy operations and support basically everything that on prem does, with no need to rewrite it all. it also offers newer ways of doing things but that's not what makes it useful IMO.\n\nSynapse offers true \"PAYG\" data processing which takes the load off your internal systems, and generally will be cheaper than Data Factory but needs a significant rewrite on new technologies (Such as Spark, Python) and a whole new approach to how things are processed. The upside is the power of the servers you can provision is massive, and you only pay for what you use - instead of paying for them 24/7.\n\nFabric offers most of what Synapse does but has a very different interface to Synapse. It also leverages One Lake. The main difference is pricing. In Synapse you need to pay for each resource individually, but in Fabric you pay for \"capacity\" which can range from storage to processing - but it all comes under one payment.\n\nThe reality is that Synapse is a great product that can operate alongside DF, and both of them utilise each other for specific functions, but Synapse is a whole new world. Fabric is aimed to try and give non technical people \"democratised\" data processing - which is a great idea but functionally is very close to giving someone 15 excel files and hoping they know what they're doing when they copy paste from them all that the data is correct at the end.\n\nAll of these technologies need a data platform and approach - trying to sell Fabric as \"better\" is just wild. I know MS are pushing it, but having worked with all 3 technologies AND on prem, i can safely say there are more headaches in fabric than the others because it's solving a problem that data engineers didn't need solved.",

Yes, you need a data platform in both. But there are genuinely significant improvements in Fabric that aren't in Synapse.\n\nYes, Synapse is a very capable platform. But it's also a challenging platform to use well. \n Synapse SQL Dedicated Pools make you choose between best performance (storing in its proprietary internal tables) and open formats (external tables). Scaling is offline, and disruptive. And they require a lot of tuning to get good performance out of them. Synapse Serverless SQL pools are better on that front, but have a lot of limitations of their own.\n\nI genuinely believe Fabric Warehouse is better than them. It gets rid of that division, and has many, many improvements elsewhere, from provisioning (scaling is online like Synapse Serverless SQL Pools, but faster and more intelligent), query optimization (overhauled and distinct from either Synapse SQL Pool offerings), query execution (improved beyond both previous products), and so on. \nI have worked on all 3 products, seen the customer experiences on all 3, and that's my honest opinion.\n\nSimilarly, if you look at Fabric Spark, it has NEE, based on Gluten and Velox, to improve performance and lower costs:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/native-execution-engine-overview?tabs=sparksql\n\nNote that Fabric Spark has a pay as you go billing option:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/autoscale-billing-for-spark-overview\n\nThere have been discussions about expanding that to other workloads where it makes sense, but that's a question for PMs rather than me.\n\nFeature development is focused on Fabric these days, so the engines in Fabric will continue to improve further with time. And as I said above, I genuinely believe they're already significantly better than what we have in Synapse. And unfortunately, many of those improvements are not really feasible to bring to Synapse - we had to do very significant rearchitecting to deliver them, and that rearchitecting means it's not really feasible to put the improvements into the older products, they just weren't designed for it. \n\nAnyway, you don't have to agree with me, that's fine. This is my personal opinion; that's your personal opinion. Reasonable people can have differences of opinions.\nThanks for sharing yours, hope this helps you understand mine a bit better too.",

Basically, each connector has a set of identical tasks, each one of which is a virtual thread in JVM. The tasks are distributed through all Kafka connect nodes, so each node has approximately the same number of running threads. \n\nSource connector tasks each have Kafka producer inside, while sink connector tasks have consumers. If you understand how simple producers and consumers work, you should easily understand why distributing Kafka Connect is much easier than Kafka itself, since most of the work is done by Kafka itself (storing consumer group offsets for example). The state of Kafka Connect is stored in special topics. \n\nDebugging should be the same as with any other JVM application. It's usually possible to run connector or task locally outside of running Connect cluster, and it's even easier so with SMT. It also supports JMX out of the box.\n\nThe real problem is that many connector plugins are not open source (for example the ones from Confluent), so you have to rely on documentation and forums.",

From there, set up a source connector that reads the latest inserts into a table and into a Kafka topic. And then after that, set up a sink connector to read from that topic and put it in another table. \n\nIf you want, you can even practice doing some data manipulation in your config files as well. This is just a simple flow for Kafka connect that you can get to work on your own machine. Kafka Connect is simply a json file that you deploy to do all the easy pub and sub for you",

Typically, data engineers focus on analytics/ML pipelines where small delays or errors are tolerable, but customer-facing use cases demand strict correctness, reliability, and low latency. While data platforms (SQL, Airflow, Kafka) can support this, they weren‚Äôt originally designed for transactional, real-time customer interactions. In most cases, such logic is better handled by application services or APIs, with the data platform serving as a downstream system of record or for batch/analytical use. Mixing the two often increases risk unless the data platform is explicitly built with real-time, mission-critical guarantees.",

Suddenly you became a kind of semi-hero in the work space? A kind of defacto tech support and programmer (even if that wasn't your main job!). \n\n------------------------------\n\nThe need was so great that... At that point, there's was pretty much nothing you could ever do to get fired! \n\nLike ya... I was younger at that time, and foolish, so even though I didn't control my emotions at some point and even yelled back at the senior founding partner of our firm, I still didn't get fired! \n\nI kid you not: I even got caught late at night in a rather compromising position with a certain colleague, in which her and I were inappropriately hitting it off... and then... well... hit it off one late night, when wouldn't you know it: that same senior partner came into the office unusually to check something. And kinda freaked, then backed out, and never spoke about it to me! (Ya, if that was today, I would have been long fired multiple times!)\n\n------------------------------\n\nAnyways... \n\nSo, I actually got hired by a pretty well known international law firm as a technical writer, since I had done two entirely separate university degrees: one physics, and one English Literature. \n\nYa, I know: that's a strange and weird combo, but those are my 2 loves in life! Despite the fact that unfortunately I'm not all that good in either of them, lol! \n\nBut the law firm dealt in many aspects related to the sciences and engineering, ranging from patents to immigration of highly talented people, etc... So they needed someone who could read scientific papers, and be semi-decent at writing. (As you can see from the length of this comment, I'm a pretty crazy writer: always constantly writing. Just not anything all that good! But still always writing, and I can type at about 90 to 100 words per minute.) \n\n------------------------------\n\nFinally to get to the point, not only did I do technical writing... \n\nBut if anyone had a problem with their computer in the office, my phone line would light up and ring (if the main tech-guy/admin wasn't there yet in the morning, or was already busy). \n\nAnd then people would approach me to help them automate some tasks. \n\nSo believe it or not, I would actually use C++ (taping into Win32) combined with a program called \"Autohotkey\" to do scripting and automation! \n\nLike who uses C++ of all things, to do quick scripting and automation tasks!? Well apparently that would be me! \n\n------------------------------\n\nBut ya, I got the job after I graduated with my second degree, and boy was I surprised by me being thrust into that role, and just rapidly utilizing anything I knew to get the job done, even if it wasn't anything close to 100% the correct language or solution model for the problem. \n\nJust as long as it worked, mostly glitch free, then nobody gave a flying F what programming language or tool I used to get the job done. \n\nAnd because of that, they never-ever-ever wanted to fire me, even though they had to scold me several times. \n\n------------------------------\n\nFast forward to today, and ya... \n\nTimes have really changed, mostly for the worse in this field unfortunately. \n\nI worry the good old fashioned crazy pure days of fun are behind us now in the tech sector, and companies have turned something great into something of misery... \n\nAka: the enshittification of everything by corporations, CEO's and MBA bro culture.",

        "body": "I've been on the other side: interviewing candidates for entry level back-end focused dev positions. Here's my thoughts.  \n\nActive Github profile (daily commits) - not important. \"Daily commits\" is especially not important, some days you just aren't going to have code worth committing. The important part is _having worked on a project of nontrivial complexity_. You had a problem and you tried to solve it... how did you approach the problem, and why did you choose the solution you did? Talking about the candidate's prior work is very valuable as the person trying to understand if the candidate in front of me might be a good fit.  \n\nWell-structured and documented programs (Modular & uses Swagger) - maybe of interest, but just having used tools like OpenAPI (which is the name of the spec for what was called \"swagger\" btw) or readthedocs or redoc doesn't actually tell me anything. Remember, I'm trying to figure out your approach to solving engineering problems. Does slapping swagger-ui into a maven project mean you're any more informed about how or why to use such a tool? Not necessarily. Now, if what you developed had an external API with users that needed to know about/test your endpoints, that's something worth asking about. This could dovetail into asking about other tools like Postman.   \n\n\"Well structured\" is too vague of advice and honestly I'd be wary of anyone preaching this to a new developer. Trying to perfectly architect your work in progress ToDo app is not a good use of time. Get your hands dirty. Learning from mistakes and iterating is the name of the game. Waxing philosophic about how you wanted your first app to scale to thousands of users might be relevant if you're interviewing at Netflix, but anywhere else it's probably just signalling that you didn't really understand when it's appropriate to use the tools at hand, or worse, that you might be the kind of junior dev who needlessly introduces more compexity.  \n\nProjects - yes, very important. Your plan is simple but if you follow through you will be fine. The only thing that stands out to me is that you don't have concrete examples for your projects. You should pick problem(s) that sounds interesting to you and then just work on them. You will inevitably run into topics that you know nothing about (how do I hook up my server to my database? how do I expose this API endpoint? how do I secure my endpoint behind basic AuthN? if my project is depending on other services, how do I rate limit my service so that I don't get angry emails/IP blocked from those services? is there some way I can process this data more efficiently?). If you are able to work on any actively maintained open source project, you can get some \"real\" dev experience before getting your first job.\n\nHere are some of the kinds of basic questions I have in my interview template:  \n\n* What do you do in your current position (if any)?  \n* What side projects have you worked on? Which languages do you use or which are you learning?\n* How familiar are you with <framework>? (e.g. Spring, React, etc)\n* Have you used git or other source control tools? Have you submitted (or reviewed and approved) a pull request before?\n* Do you know what a unit test is? What do you think is the point of tests?\n* Walk me through your side project (if any). What was your role, how did the design go, what were any challenges you ran into? What would you have changed?\n* <coding/logic problem>\n* Can you talk about a situation where someone disagreed with your recommendation, or vice versa, on an important aspect of a project?",

This works ok for relatively simple code bases, but any job you will want will expect it, even if the code seems trivial.\nRather than manually testing your code, just write unit tests. Want to see if something you wrote works? The first time you execute it should be with unit tests. View the tests as a developer tool to give you an easy way to execute the code you are working on.\nAs the complexity grows, manually testing all the scenarios will become infeasible and a waste of your time. Tests will safeguard you from accidentally breaking something, and tell you exactly what is broken when you do.\nAs for test driven development I think that is a bit extreme. I rarely write tests first, usually only when I have a bug I want to make sure the test exposes so I know the test exposes it and the fix actually fixes the issue. But once I have enough code written to start executing it, I execute it with unit tests until I‚Äôm reasonably confident it works as intended. Then I run it a few times for the gratification of using it, then move on to the next enhancement.\nDemonstrating that you do this in the code you are writing to demonstrate an ability to be a junior dev will help you stand out from the huge number of people that don‚Äôt.",

This is a 3-case lex, 3-function recursive descent parse, then single-function tree walk situation, if you want a proper solution. I'd expect the first solution to be some awkward/inflexible string splitting which broke the second the input changed slightly. If I had more than 30 mins I'd ask how it could be made more robust, at which point I'd expect a suggestion like mine above. I probably wouldn't make them code it up though. Just knowing tells me what I need to know about them for the purpose of the interview.  If I had to suggest the improvement, I might see if they could work with me to code it up by asking good questions etc, almost pair programming style.\n\nMy advice in these is always to use the interviewer as a resource as much as possible. Lots of people go very quiet and try to mentally brute force, then fail, when they could have asked for more help from me. I don't know what they need help with specifically without them asking. On the job, it's fine to ask colleagues things, so it's generally not frowned upon in interview either, as long as you're not asking for the full solution etc.\n\nEdit: code in thread below.",

As you yourself said, it took half an hour even after you Googled for the C functions you needed.\n\nI suppose the tip is to know you C string functions. \n\nThere is a bunch of ways to solve it. If you could create a second array, you could have replaced +/- with spaces, and then split on that.

It's good to copy once or twice and follow along tutorials to get a baseline, youve got that part down, but you aren't proving you've learned how to build shit by doing that. \n\nYou need to reframe how you go about this and treat it like learning an actual spoken language. You learn some nouns and verbs (keywords in programming), then you learn some concepts and combine those with your vocabulary (grammar), but you will never be able to speak with just that (speaking = programming).\n\n\nYou can pass a Japanese test and technically \"know\" Japanese this way, but you'll never be able to express your own thoughts to a native. In the same way you can't program your own apps. \n\n\nIf you want to progress beyond the beginners at your stage and speed up your learning, paradoxically you need to slow down. Pause the \"studying\" and \"learning\" you're doing for now and do the same thing youd do for learning a spoken language. Take what you know and form your own sentences and evaluate where you get lost and what you need to learn more of. \n\n\nSpeaking a language = coding a project. Coding is NOT and will not ever be the most difficult part about being a programmer. Coding is hard for beginners and anyone that tells you that coding is the hard part likely does not understand what programming actually is. Build something, and when you finish build something else. Occasionally rebuild something youve already built, maybe add some new tricks youve learned to speed the process up or add features you were unable to the first time.\n\n\nAnd \"i can't build anything yet\" is not an acceptable answer. Day one of a spoken language course you learn how to say \"hello\", day one of a coding course you learn how to say \"Hello World\". Thats a project in the same way that a simple sentence in Japanese is. It's not impressive, but it is by definition a project. Now add complexity to your app. Can you print \"something besides Hello World? Can you make it print that new phrase 10 times? Can you print out what a user types? Can you make that phrase print 10 times? Can you take in more than one string of user input? \n\n\nIf you know how to do those things, you should be able to bang your head against a wall and build a calculator. A little more complicated than \"Hello World\" and takes quite a bit more work, but building it is a lot more feasible than you think. \n\n\nCoding isnt hard. But it takes practice.

It‚Äôs how we all learned to speak. Our brains are actually designed to work this way.\n\nSo if you are retyping programming basics like loops, syntax, the use of built in methods, turning an array into a map, the elements of a form that go together, and the js methods that move the info from the front end to the back end, the shape of classes and functions, event listeners and their methods, etc‚Ä¶ I think that stuff is okay to copy as long as you type it out line by line. It‚Äôs hard to tell while you‚Äôre doing it, but you are learning things just by transposing them from the screen through your keyboard. You will inevitably miss a symbol or a letter and you‚Äôll have to scan through and figure out what went wrong. This will help you gain deeper understanding. \n\nEventually you see the patterns. Seemingly disconnected confusing things start to become connected and organized. \n\nAt its heart programming is us training ourselves to be conscious of subconscious steps. Like we never have to think of every individual step of putting on a t-shirt. We just know how to do it. I believe when we program our brain begins to subconsciously understand what is happening which is why (after it clicks) sometimes coding can feel like magic, and why we have to reread and relearn code we wrote two weeks ago. \n\nIf you find yourself copying something that looks familiar too often I would say take some time and focus on the use of that thing by itself. \n\nBut  if you copy paste you‚Äôre mostly not learning.",

Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.\n1. Next, implement the base case.\n1. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.\n1. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.\n1. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.\n\n\nThe main thing to know is that recursion is mostly overrated. If your problem involves both 1) a tree structure and 2) back tracking, then it's a good candidate for recursion. Otherwise, if you find yourself asking, \"Why couldn't I just do this with a loop\" then you're right: it's a poor candidate for recursion and you should just use the simpler loop solution.",

But you'd need one stack for the file scanner objects (representing the system's view of the directories you had descended) and another for the data you were building for each directory... and you'd carefully inspect each file object, and push a new file scanner if it was a directory, and carefully handle your end-of-scan issues at each level, popping both stacks... it could get tricky.\n\nNow consider doing it with recursion.  You imagine the functional interface you want ‚Äì let's say, a File, and a DataSoFar.  Consider your base case ‚Äì is the File a simple file, not a directory?  Great, you're done.  Produce your output.  Otherwise you need to recurse ‚Äì okay, it's a directory: update DataSoFar, create a scanner from the File, loop through the scanner and call your function on each of the files.  Boom, done.  The book-keeping and boundary conditions are handled for you by the program stack, and you stick to familiar function calling and error-handling idioms.\n\nThe key leap for me is always that imaginative step: *what's the functional interface I wish I could use to solve one step of this problem?*  Recursion sometimes allows you to achieve that interface with minimal effort and great clarity.",

First thoughts is I need to have two sets of words, I need to display them and I need to take input. Maybe a database? A gui? Do I know any database? No, okey... do I know any gui? No, do I learn one? Where do I get the words? Do I input them? Do I use any cloud solution?\n\nThis never ending circle of questions, or you could just write a function that takes a word of language L and a word of language K then it returns true if it's correct. Internally it finds the L word in list L and checks if K word matches the word at the same index in list K. This is your core mechanic AND database. You can go even lower and make sure you can match strings at all.\n\nGUI? Once you start considering libraries and frameworks... thats a whole can of worms on it's own...print to terminal first.

        "body": "That is a very good analogy, and the answer is actually quite simple!\n\nThe way you figure out if \"the programming LEGO piece you need actually exists\" is exactly they way you figure out if an actual LEGO piece you need exists!\n\nEvery time you build a LEGO-set you follow instructions, like a tutorial - and you take note of new pieces or unique ways they are used, storing them in memory for when you later want to build something similar. The next time you are building one of your own creations, you have some ideas of what pieces you have and how they could be used, so you disassemble some of your sets, and try to use the pieces in different ways in your own creation. Maybe it'll work, and you have to order more pieces like it - or it won't work and you have to imagine something else.\n\nWhen not building you are sorting your pieces, experimenting with connecting them in different ways, trying out small techniques outside of large projects, and you get ideas for how you also could use those pieces, maybe you even get an idea for a large project using the pieces that way!\n\nAlso, you follow builders on social media, and talk with other builders, asking for inspiration, looking inside their creations, and you are always learning!\n\nWhen you have an idea for something, but absolute no knowledge of how to build it, you try sketching it, experiment with the pieces you have, will this fit? No, well how about this? Maybe if I turn that one that way?\n\nYou won't always succeed, and some projects might be abandoned, but you are always learning!\n\n  \nDon't ever expect to \"see\" the magical piece that will solve your exact problem, if you have never worked on anything even remotely similar, or even seen pieces anywhere close to what you need!\n\nAnd don't think that you'll immediately get to know thousands of pieces and how they connect - sometimes you will have to make things \"the wrong way\", or simply \"fake\" them, make a function that pretends to do the work for you, until you learn the right way. Take a look at the LEGO creations by young kids, they almost never look exactly like they should, but they are an appromixation.\n\nSo, answer 1 is: always be learning, experiment with what you have, try to solve it close enough. And answer 2 is: Don't try to look for the perfect solution when you only know 1% of everything that is - look around you, and see if you can get just a little closer to your goal!

        "body": "For number 2, I've had to deal with that forever - I've never been a fan of people using \"I have ADD!\" as an excuse for everything, but programming with ADD is... well, it can be an advantage at times but it can also be a severe disadvantage for that exact reason - before you know it you've got 40 tabs open and are working on three new things completely unrelated to the problem you were trying to solve. \n\nOne thing that helps me is using something to keep track of that sort of thing - a folder, a bookmark app, anything where you can drop everything you come across that makes you go \"that's cool/useful/whatever\" but isn't directly related to what you're doing *now*. Without that, a five minute research search can end with me realizing it's 2 am and I've gotten nothing done. \n\nAs for the rest... it really is just experience, and not feeling bad about the fact that you still need to look stuff up X years in. For example, I've been using PHP for like 20 years and I still have to look up simple functions because I forget the syntax *all the time*. Who cares, though? I know what it does and how it works, not remembering what comes first in a substring isn't the end of the world.\n\nFor me, at least, becoming a better programmer is less about memorization or always knowing what the right \"piece\" is, and is more about a general understanding and \"feel\" for how things work. You might not know if a specific function exists to do what you want, and it sucks to spend the time working on something only to find out later it was as easy as using a function that already exists, but it's probably going to happen to you more than once - but now you know the function exists and you know how to work without it. Figuring out how to do something, even the most trivial \"I'll never need to do this again\" thing, is never a *bad* thing and will help you grow. Maybe later you'll be learning another language that's similar but it doesn't have an applicable function for what you were doing, and it's not a problem because you know how to do it by hand. This probably isn't the most realistic example, the point is that I try to never look at \"I just did more than I needed to\" as a negative as long as it's not causing you to miss deadlines (and as long as it's not happening constantly).\n\nI'm hesitant to push AI as it's really easy to become overly reliant on it, and you should never rely on code AI slings out without vetting it yourself, but if you treat it like a search engine it's certainly a lot easier to say \"I'm trying to do X with Y and am wondering what methods others currently use\" than to try and get the perfect Google search or scroll through docs.\n\nIt never hurts to join a coding community, either. I haven't done that since usenet but I'm sure there are discords or whatever out there.",

Plus once your are out of school if you decide you want to go back or do some courses on the side you can.  \n  \nTL;DR: I have been programming for over 21 years and  15 of them professionally on some level. The one thing I can guarantee in this industry is you will always be learning.",

Not necessarily trivial - I've been programming for almost 4 decades, but I've never learned Rust for instance and if you told me I had to write something in Rust with a gun to my head I of course couldn't do it. But if I got hired for a job and was told \"Oh yeah we only work in Rust\" I'd just go \"Great, I'm excited to learn Rust!\" and not be too intimidated by it.\n\nOnce you've got a strong foundation, your choice of technology will just be driven by what you want to *do* next. You pick something you want to create (or get hired onto a job) and you learn what you need to know as you need to know it. If you're working on getting hired, you pick a project that overlaps strongly with the needs of your local job market, and you learn what you need to make yourself an attractive candidate.\n\nBut if you don't have fundamentals down, go back to working on that. Without tutorials, AI, or any of that junk. Take one of the many free university courses (university courses, even if they're free and not for credit, tend to be much more rigorous than much of the junk on youtube or whatever) and get your data structures and algorithms skills solid, etc.\n\nFirst step though is really assessing where you are right now.",

Java Spring Boot does a similar thing but with decorators, favouring composition over inheritance. Node Express doesn‚Äôt have Controller classes/prototypes, instead endpoints are just function properties assigned to an instance of an App object with callbacks to define their behaviour. They all have the concept of endpoints, they all have HTTP verbs and request/response objects, they all push you more or less to an MVC architecture, but very different implementations. Knowing the concept is way more important than knowing only one implementation.\n\nWhen you move to a language you don‚Äôt know - say Rust - and you try and implement an endpoint as a Node Express style async function, you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time.

        "body": "If you've learned front-end with TypeScript, then you can already write back-end with Node.js and TypeScript. You'll have to learn about databases, SQL and how to make an API, but that's fairly trivial.\n\nFor example, learn about the [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) package and read [Best practices for RESTful web API design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design) and boom, back-end achieved. Next step is about actually saving that data.\n\nTo save data, you need a database and you'll need to talk to it through a Structured Query Language called SQL. You can learn SQL [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/), but then the database stuff gets a bit complicated. You can install MariaDB locally and learn on that, then in the future you'll want to learn about Docker Compose to avoid having to install the DB locally during development and you'll probably want to use PostgreSQL, but right now it doesn't matter. Just go with SQL/MariaDB and learn the concepts.\n\nOnce you've got a database, your Node.js app will need to somehow connect to the database you just installed. For MariaDB, there's a [package](https://mariadb.com/docs/connectors/mariadb-connector-nodejs/getting-started-with-the-node-js-connector) for that.\n\nBoom, back-end with API and data storage achieved, without tutorial, all by yourself. It's the same steps for any programming language.\n\nAdmittedly, that route is what a tutorial would give you, but anyway. Concepts are what's valuable at the moment. Or if you feel like you'd have more fun in Go than TypeScript, then just go for it, it'll be roughly the same thing.",

There is no tutorial, there is no shortcut.\n\nTutorials/courses can teach you the basic skills; they can lay the *foundation*. It is upon you to build the house brick by brick, floor by floor.\n\nYou start with small, simple games and work your way up.\n\nTake the game engine of your choice (I'd recommend Godot for starters) and build something simple, something like e.g. *Tic-Tac-Toe*. Then venture into more complex territory, e.g. something like *Battleships*. Then, move on to more complex tasks, e.g. *Sokoban (Box Pusher)* - these are all fairly simple to make games that will each teach you a lot. To get something more dynamic, the classic *Pong* or *Breakout (Arkanoid clone)* are good starts, but only after you have progressed enough. Make a *Pacman* clone. \n\nUsing old games has the advantage that the entire *game mechanics* are well known and well documented.\n\nWhen you gradually build up your skills you can always venture into larger, more complex games, make the switch from 2D to 2.5D (often also wrongly called Isometric) to 3D.\n\nWith each game you make you will improve your skills, *provided* that you don't just do tutorial after tutorial that creates the game *for* you. At utmost, use the tutorials as inspiration and try to make things on your own. Then, if you fail and can't find a solution, look at the tutorial to see how they did it. Don't just copy the tutorial. First, try on your own. Experimenting, trying, failing, fixing are all part of learning, copying is not learning.\n\nAlso, games are developed *incrementally*. They start with simple mechanics, e.g. how to interact with the player, how to set up the levels, etc. Then, they work with the collisions, and so on. Commonly, the *game art* is quite far towards the end of the development. Sure, you need to know roughly how big your game entities (players, enemies, background, etc.) will be but you don't need to have them fully developed at the start.\n\nGet things working first and then make them good and pretty.",

Sometimes, the companies offering the apprenticeship or their clients will hire the apprentice, which is an easy start in the industry. \n\nAlso - don't fear AI.

Maybe you are learning a new language, a new framework, a new library. That is useful as a preparation for other things to come.\n\nWork? Yes, yes ... That will be how you sustain yourself, but most likely, if you are a craftsman, or artist, work will be less interesting, than your own projects. As you progress in skill, your work will probably be simpler, more rote, than your own projects.\n\nAbout interviews: Don't forget, that interviews are a stress situation. Depending on the person, mostly what they test is stress resilience, not your computer programming skill. What you are describing about being given 2h and a bunch of files ... That might as well be badly designed code, that is a trap into bad design. In such a situation you might have to deal with the shit you are given as code, but keep an open mind to alternative solutions.\n\nI have been working for 7y mostly using Python and still I did no good in interviews with live coding. Sometimes it was the requirements, that were too narrow, them expecting one particular solution. Other times I was too nervous and simply couldn't think straight. In contrast to my work experience, in which I basically built a company from the ground up, at least on the technical side, and on my own designed and developed multiple still maintained services, that make the company their money.\nSo mostly my interviewing experience has been quite shit, and it can happen to everyone.

Learn to take the concept and write out exactly:\n1) what it needs to work (minimum requirements)\n2) who‚Äôs going to use it\n3) are there similar options on the market already\n4) what can we do that nobody else does or better than they do\n5) what would be nice additions to the project\n\nI found actually doing that brought my personal projects to a new level. Actually do the documentation and planning as if it were a company and write a report after explaining everything and going through pros and cons. \n\nDo it on a basic project you think you can do first to see how you‚Äôd like to implement it. \n\nThen pick a framework Python -> Flask -> Jinja, web app. Use your next project to learn that framework work. \n\nDo the analysis, do the planning, make the design and run proper testing and reports. \n\nYou‚Äôve just upped your game massively by taking something used in the real professional world and you have a better understanding with real implementation as proof. \n\nI learned that through an internship. My supervisor took the time constraint away on a side part of the software we were building. He didn‚Äôt write up reports on all the elements he was building but said it was the best way for me to learn. \n\nHe wasn‚Äôt standing over me the whole time (it was remote so that was impossible anyway) but I had to talk him through everything at each stage as if I was proposing it to the company. \n\nFunny enough he said it was fine to use ChatGPT for filling out some of the work (HTML and CSS) but I had to go through and be able to present it explaining each section. \n\nMy part of the project was a web app for making reports completely detached from the actual project but it was set to be part of the final projects package. So I needed to treat it as if it was going to be launched with the product.",

Do you mean how the computer even starts up, where it gets the programs from?\n\nIf so:\n\nEvery computer has some form of persistent memory, the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) where the bootstrap code is stored (in modern times, this is the UEFI BIOS with some more data and programming).\n\nA CPU only knows one thing: to look at a certain address in a memory (typically address 0) and execute whatever is there.\n\nThe BIOS of a computer has the bootstrap program at exactly that address stored. In the former days, this was an actual ROM, now it is usually some form of erasable programmable memory, like an EEPROM.\n\nThe BIOS then has all the code to carry out the POST (Power On Self Test), plus libraries/functionality to talk with the various hardware components, and the code to then start, in case of a PC, the Operating System, of which the boot-loader is stored in a certain place on the hard drive (SSD, nVme, etc) of the computer.\n\nIn case of the modern UEFI BIOS, this system is usually also stored on the computer's hard drive, but also exists in a storage on the main board so that when you change the hard drive, the computer can still boot.\n\nA good start to understand how everything of this plays together is to look into Microcontrollers, like the 8031/8051, Atmel (Arduino) as they are basically the same as a PC minus the operating system.",

        "body": "> At the moment I have the impression that every language is able to do anything\n\nYes and no.  Any Turing complete language, which is effectively all of them, can manipulate state, which is what programs do.  Any general purpose language, which is most of them, can do most tasks.\n\nHowever, where those languages can be used is a function of implementation.  OS broadly, web browser narrowly, your favorite game, maybe Lua.\n\n> Can you give me examples of where some feature is not implemented in a language because it would directly block another feature? \n\nHow about [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)?  How a language lets you define and handle types tends to be a defining feature.  It also will impact every aspect of how you develop a program in that language.  Choose one, block the other.  A strict type system catches errors at compile time, a loose one might only catch some errors at run time.  Write your tests accordingly.\n\nAlong the same lines, [mutablity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object).  This is the break point between imperative and declarative.  The level to which that can be dictated by the programmer also defines a language.\n\n[Function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) comes to mind.  It's extremely popular, lots of languages do it, and lots don't.  There are pros and cons in implementing such a feature.  There is implementation complexity but also programmer expectation.\n\nGarbage collection?  How resources are released is a big deal in all languages.  In some languages, all clean up is the responsibility of the programmer.  In others, the programmer barely has a say.\n\nVirtual machines?  Java and .NET, among others, run inside a sandbox.  This is good for portability and stability, buy denies access to the OS; you get what the sandbox gives you.\n\nLast, but not exhaustively, libraries.  The standard libraries available to a language might dictate its use.  If what you want to do only has a library in C, you're either porting it to your favorite language, creating an interop wrapper for it, or writing in C.",

Most of them can do the task. It's just what you like.\n\nThink about C++ and Objective-C. Both were attempts to make C object-oriented. Did one stop when they heard about the other? Did C++ win because it was the best for the job? No, C++ won because it was part of AT&T which was a much bigger entity than the folks that developed Objective-C.\n\nIt's just like natural languages. Is English the best language? Some (who natively speak it) say yes, but it's only because they speak it. Others insist that their language is best. We could learn Esperanto which was a designed language where the ease of learning was a key objective. Yet, it's not popular because people love their own languages, and maybe ease of learning isn't that important. Some people love how complex their language is (or how many feature it has).\n\nTo get to your second question, there are languages that try to avoid using null, so they have to create Option types (that's one way to do it). This creates a level of mental overhead that those who have never used those types find unimportant, yet others, who think null pointer exceptions are evil and the cause of many errors feel it's justified.\n\nOr languages that want to be pure functional have problems with I/O, such as printing, and have to use complex math structures like monads, when everyone else feels printing is really easy, but it's counter to the functional philosophy.\n\nProlog was built to have a backtracking mechanism, and for most, it looks like nothing you'd expect and is hard to get your mind around, and because of that, hard to figure out. Erlang, which was inspired by Prolog, has a syntax that's hard for those used to C-style syntax (which is most popular languages) to understand, partly because it was designed before language designers decided languages should look like C.\n\nAnd was that because C was a great language? No, but it was hugely popular in industry, so to design languages that looked like C was considered beneficial because people were more likely to try out your language if they didn't have to struggle with the syntax as much.\n\nFunctional languages don't like having state, so they don't have plain old for-loops because the looping variables change values. So, they use functions like: fold, map, filter, zip, etc. to achieve looping capabilities without a looping variable. They also rely a lot on recursion.\n\nIt helps if you try these other languages like learning Prolog or Erlang or Haskell to see how different they are.",

Power point was never intended to be used as a programming language but you can use it to programm anything and thus it also wont ever recieve a lot of the common features so you would have to write them your self.\n\nA more relaistic example are garbage collections. Some languages have them others dont. And this is not a this language just hasnt gotten to the point of implementing them, its a deliberate decission to leave it to the programmer to do deal with it them self so they wont ever get that \"feature\". You can also argue that its a feature to not have a garbage collection.\n\nThis goes on with other things, like some languages are made in mind to be used with oop and thus have strong support for oop. Other are made in mind with procedual code. And the maintainers of a procedual language wont implement oop features. \n\nSo no its not about just speed.",

They can all be made with Python. Also, Python has many free resources out there. so use that advantage.",

Even if the database in question uses some other query language (Neo4j uses a special language to query graphs called Cypher, Mongo uses a specially crafted JSONs, etc) the ideas for data selection and aggregation are often transferrable between them. So, doing good at SQL will open doors to data science, business analysis, database performance work, and in general will make you more valuable for every developer team in the future.\n\nAnother one such \"language\" is regular expressions. Python may not be a good language to learn and use them because AFAIK it lacks special syntax support for them, but Ruby, Rust, JavaScript have better syntax for them. Learning regexes *well* will help you work with unstructured data, extract data form text, logs, do data migration between systems, and do quick changes to text files including some advanced search-and-replace operations in your code editor. It's a very good supplemental skill to have.\n\nLearning Shell scripting is my third recommendation. Learning how to combine programs together, build pipelines, learning SSH tunneling - all of this will be useful over decades, too.\n\nA large pert of programmer's work is spent outside of their primary language, so getting comfortable with the world besides `if`s and `for`s is always a good idea.",

These roles are always undervalued and under represented in big team projects in university and schools. Some people might partake in this role, but usually the team doesn‚Äôt take the role seriously. But that is usually the way it is with product managers - they have to make themselves useful, so that the team can see the purpose in the role.\n\nEven though you can‚Äôt code, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs a lot of things that you‚Äôve caught on about - use that knowledge to support the team in every possible way. Communication is key - as it is in any successful endeavor.\n\nBut you won‚Äôt learn enough in a month  - it is simply not enough time.\n\nBut if you do choose to study hard and try to make lost time, here‚Äôs a few suggestion for you:\n\nStop focusing on fancy called examples or guides from people that tell you that this kind of projects will get you jobs - find something that is within your scope of capabilities; even if this means this is simply a small blogging website or a simple web crawler or even a calculator. Finish that project - and do not use AI tools to complete it.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong. AI tools are extremely powerful and in the industry we use them daily. But at least where I come from we have a saying, that the AI is only as good as your own understanding - but understanding doesn‚Äôt come, unless you put down the groundwork.\n\n\nI‚Äôm sorry if this is harsh, but I truly wish you the very best in the future.",

Circles is loser talk!\n* Stole animated gifs from another implementation of this program\n* Created 2D array, filled it with gifs.

My biggest piece of advice, based on my own journey, is don't get lost in a forest of theory and code at the start.\n\nJust learn the absolute basics‚Äîvariables, loops, etc.‚Äîand then immediately start doing. Try to build something super simple. A huge help for me was using an AI assistant. You can literally tell it, \"Explain this to me like I'm a child,\" and it will break down complex concepts into really simple terms.

On Windows you could make a pure Windows app for Pong, on Linux you could make a pure GTK Linux app for Pong. On some platforms like macOS or Android you could write an app that's 99% C with a tiny bit of another language to set things up and write Pong. None of them would be the same.\n\nWhat msot C books or courses will teach you is stuff that's a little more abstract - just problem solving and data manipulation, rather than building a complete app. That reflects how C is used these days. It's the foundational language used behind the scenes of everything so it's really important to know - but it's not the main language used to build apps and the software people actually use.\n\nMy advice would be to start with Harvard's CS50x.

I'll answer them separately:\n\n>is it necessary to read ~~all of~~ the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?\n\nI'd lean on the side of yes. Reason being - each language has it's idiosyncracies/hidden gotchas/pitfalls. Most (if not all) of these are usually spelt out in the docs. In fact, several questions people ask on reddit/stackoverflow have their answers lying partially or wholly in the docs.\n\nThat being said, there are caveats to how much of the docs one needs to read. I've added some context around this further below.\n\n>is it necessary to read ALL OF the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?\n\nNo. It's recommended, but not necessary to read ALL of the documentation.  My personal opinion is that you should only read the docs for things you're explicitly working with (though it's always good to go above and beyond).\n\n>I ask because documentation often contains a lot of specifications and information that can be overwhelming. I have been advised to read the \"reference manuals\" first, but even that is difficult.\n\nI feel you. Docs can be overwhelming especially if you're just starting out / are not familiar with the language. Here's how I do it (may or may not work for you) - I tend to generally only give docs a very surface level read/ avoid them until I'm fairly well versed with the language. Then - once I start doing more complex stuff - I tend to simply use my IDE to read docs for specific things I'm working with.\n\nE.g. in Java, if I'm using a class from the core library, I can hit F12 in my IDE to go to the class's source code and read the doc comments directly within that class.\n\nI find that this compartmentalizes the doc information to only the specific pieces of info I need for my work. It's much less overwhelming to me that way. YMMV.",

Nope.\n\nWhile you certainly can, it may not be the best way to approach it.\n\nIve been learning since jan, ive been using udemy courses, yt vids, projects and docs. Nowhere could i find a methodology to go through the documentation to find something and honestly its kinda confusing especially with poorly written docs.\n\nWhat i have found to help is to start high level and zoom into specifics as you get a better idea of what to do. \n\nHeres a recent example from my side while building a crud app. \n\nI want to create and view a blog article so what do i do? \nAssuming the html forms and express server is already set up. Ok so i need to be able to firstly log the inputs, what does it look like, how do i do that, and if its not in a useable state, how do i transform it. Ok then i need to be able to access the json file and also somehow save to the json file. Ok then lastly to view the article i need to again access the json and somehow display the info somewhere in my html( or in my case ejs template). Again what would happen if the data is not in a useable state? \n\nThis breaks down all the steps which you can then go looking for your methods. So as an example (im using node and express for the backend) i want to access the json file. So you can google that and read around or go straight to the docs (if you know roughly which module) and then look for various ways to read a json file. And then when you find, ok so in the fs module i have a few methods to choose from, .read().readFile().createReadStream(), so among these methods which one is applicable to my situation. Now you're reading the docs, looking at specifics, comparing methods with a specific goal in mind. You can even test each one to see if it works or not. \n\nI have found this to work for me... And yes its very time intensive as compared to just getting the code from AI in 30sec. \n\nLike i said, im still learning, but im keen to hear your opinions and any more seasoned professionals on how they approach docs. Its something that doesn't get explained on how to navigate and find what you need.",

The problem you need to solve is _text processing and XML handling_, but what you're asking about is _fully understanding Python_. These are two different things.\n\nPython as a language lets you be productive with only a small understanding of the language itself (that's how I got started with it; I've actually forgotten how or when I started writing Python, at some point I realised that's what I was writing my scripts in, rather than Perl or Bash).\n\nIn programming, as elsewhere, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. The stuff you write with only a minimal understanding of Python will look awkward to someone more experienced, including yourself some few months from now.\n\nGenerally what you want is:\n\n1. a _good enough_ understanding of the language semantics itself. \"Good enough\" is poorly defined, and varies by language:\n  * A language like Rust will require more investment in learning up front, but deliver very few gotchas down the line\n  * A language like Javascript or PHP will require very little investment in learning up front, but deliver more gotchas down the line\n  * Python is kinda more middle-of-the-road.\n  * For this bit you kinda just gotta read a book, preferably a good one so you don't fall asleep, and do some exercises to get a feel for it.\n1. A decent understanding of engineering in the language, as in, how do you write long-term maintainable code?\n  * This includes which libraries and external tools you're expected to use.\n  * For Python you kinda have to check /r/Python and other resources, but currently Astral tools like `uv` and `ruff` are good to have in your toolkit, and a typechecker like Microsoft's `pyright` until Astral's `ty` gets to 1.0.\n  * Static analysis, both typechecking and linters, will help you catch weaknesses in your understanding of what you're doing.\n1. A decent ability to discover relevant information in documentation, especially reading API docs.\n  * Generally searching is better than trying to memorize everything. Your brain can only fit so much information.\n  * Language servers / IDEs can help a lot with discoverability.",

Consider ‚Äúgathering requirements‚Äù this in itself is some documentation you want to create before you start developing. You probably also want to pin down any quality attributes and relevant SLO/SLAs, and a workable architecture or design for your software. Basically you start by producing a pile of documentation that you reference throughout your development, and while developing you may produce documentation about certain methods or functions, or a quirk of a third party system you interact with, and so on, which will help the future developers (likely you) maintain the project. You‚Äôll also want ‚Äúuser facing documentation‚Äù that the people who use the software you produce can use to help them get the most out of it or answer questions for them when they stumble across a workflow quirk.\n\nFurther I consider the value of a SWE to not just be code output, but ‚Äúknowledge output‚Äù, so alongside development or while making architectural decisions or soliciting requirements, or after getting user feedback, they should also be learning things about the domain and ideally producing some documentation that can help the whole team understand the why and how behind certain domain-specific things. Code is almost inherently technical debt, and knowledge is the only thing that lets you pay it down.\n\nIt sounds like a lot, but all of it can usually fit in an agile sprint or whatever. And to some extent it depends on what level of developer you are, Jr. dev will likely not be getting customer requirements, setting quality attributes and SLOs, nor drafting architecture. However, a Jr. dev will likely be expected to write some unit documentation for the code they create, and may be expected to write user-facing documentation for the feature they implement.",

Just make sure you're comfortable with differential calculus, vectors, and the basics of statistics.\n\nI find it's easier to learn math in the context of computer science, since you can see and practice real life implementations. For example, I only fully grasped statistics after applying it in my Intro to AI class. For that reason, I don't think it's necessary to start learning math now in anticipation of university courses.\n\nI wish you good luck in your computer science journey!",

PHP backends with modern JS frontends is a killer combo that lots of companies want.\n\nThe Spring Boot frustration you felt is totally normal.. Java web dev has a steep learning curve compared to Laravel's elegance. Most Java courses do start way too basic which is annoying when you already know how to code.\n\nIf you really want to explore Java, maybe try building a simple REST API first instead of jumping into Thymeleaf.

A service must be designed with the intent to be runnable in multiple instances for it to be considered horizontally scalable, not all applications meet these criteria, and once they meet them, other services they depend on (e.g. databases, queues, weird disk based sharing) must also be able to meet demand, or else the service will just bottleneck outside of its control.\n\nResilience can be broken down into three categories, what happens when  the service breaks, what happens when the services around it break, and what happens when the service is used incorrectly - all three must be covered for it to be resilient, and cloud helps with none of these.\n\nWhat you probably have in mind is *availability,* which yes, load balancing a service which supports it in the cloud, whether automatically or manually, does to an extent solve availability (*to an extent is doing a lot of heavy lifting here).* This is what happens when *one or more* instances of your service are no longer available.\n\nSecurity is not only authorization and authentication, but also what information I can receive from your system while being a legitimate user, whether I can abuse timing, delays, your concurrency model, false requests, rollbacks and a thousand other things.\n\nHowever, most job postings don't really mean all this, it's just a fun thing to write these days.",

        "body": "Great answer from u/disposepriority !\n\nFor my two pence, I'd like to add that, as much as the internet is only as fast as the slowest connection between you and the other end, the same can be said for \"resilient, scalable and secure\" software... if the fundamental processing units (the deployed code) are flaky and buggy, you are going to find stuff dying, then AWS for example will trigger an EB/EC2/Docker restart depending on what deployment route you set up, that will be blue/green usually so least disruptive but still, until the new box is switched live, users are left running the faulty one!\n\nSo, from the bottom up it helps if good development practices regarding tests, integrations tests, staging servers to test prior to production release etc, these are all factors in a \"reliable\" system.\n\nAs for **scalable**, depends on your needs: horizontal scaling is easy enough with AWS to trigger more boxes up under heavy loads, but again the onus is on you to make sure you can handle sessions properly, JWT based authentication usually makes that a no brainer but if you are using database sessions then that adds an extra step I guess but all normal stuff these days, plenty of best practices guides out there and from AWS; they have documentation on everything but it can be hard to find / hard to digest at times.\n\n**Vertical** scaling with AWS is easier if you use something like Terraform, we have a guy does that for us. Usually vertical scaling isn't an issue for us, we use Django and Celery and they run on separate instances to reduce load on the main API server, for that we use RabbitMQ in the mix. I can't remember the last we needed to tweak a box specification. We run everything via ECR/ECS, the AWS Docker solution.\n\n**Performant**: Well to some extent this goes back to initial software design, choosing the most efficient algorithms, libraries and your own data structures. For example, me being an big fan of Lisp, Haskell etc I tend to use \\`deque\\` instead of the stock Python list as it handles certain types of insertions faster than the List (possible premature by me?), then you can hand it back as  a list() if you want later.\n\n[https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)\n\nand I have added this: [https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity)\n\n**Secure**: We use at rest encryption for our RDS instances, plus certain data models have custom load and save to perform encryption prior to sending fields to the database for double protection, using the SECRET\\_KEY value.\n\nAlso, we use asymmetric encryption on the JWT token, using the AWS Parameter Store to manage all keys, our environment configurations, TaskDefinitions etc are all setup to reference the keys so that they are available to Django at runtime through a simple AWS API call, and some are pushed into the running environment as we use \\`decouple.config()\\` quite a lot as well.\n\nSo, that's what we do!",

The platform can do it, no stress, but whether the app can handle it is up to the app. If you slap an old stateful app into kubernetes and make more replicas of it, you're pretty likely to get bad behaviour, as in erroneous responses or crashes.\n\nWe had high availability designs for apps before cloud providers, they were just a bit more of a PITA to get the other replicas for.\n\nOne guide to getting there is the [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/). The guide might look a bit weird to those of us who think those are just normal apps, and work with gitops and distroless containers on a daily basis.\n\n> And would using the cloud platform's built-in authentication and authorization services be enough to ensure security?\n\nYeah, nah. You can still leak your credentials and do lots of stupid shit. Vibe coders do it all the time. You need to have some idea of what authn and authz means, _why_ you do it, and which bits of information can go where. If you think the cloud services provide all the security you need and then push sensitive information out to any client, you've fucked up.\n\nSecurity is also something of an eternal cat-and-mouse game. Like some algorithms need to pretend to be slow just to limit their vulnerability to timing attacks. Security is an entire rabbit hole of its own.\n\n> I also see job postings that want experience designing \"performant\" software. Aren't you always trying to make code as efficient as possible? What is performant software and how would software not be performant?\n\nSoftware is non-performant for a whole host of reasons, and getting it to be performant isn't just one thing. One thing is bad [big-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), but people also do stuff like bad structuring of network calls, and to some extent choosing the wrong language (program design usually matters a lot more than language choice).",

By making projects, you'll be exposing yourself to new technologies and techniques that you may not've learned about just through following tutorials or something.\n\nJust keep progressing and you'll end up finding new things by surprise.",

There are also millions of other developers hoping to break into freelancing who are charging very little in order to build a reputation.\n* It's not just enough to want to earn money from home. You actually have to have the aptitude and interest. Learning to be a developer takes years of dedication and hard work. Most people who think it sounds interesting give up once they realize how hard it is.\n\nIf you're interested in being a developer, the only solid route is a 4-year Computer Science degree (or equivalent), then a few years of in-person employment to get experience, then you might have a chance of going remote eventually.",

Learn something like data structures, loops, and functions, then immediately put them into practice through small, fun projects. For example, if you learn about lists and loops, build a simple quiz game or a to do list app. This way, you‚Äôll reinforce your learning and keep it engaging. Projects don‚Äôt have to be big or complex at this stage so just think of them more as practice reps.\n\nExam prep and coding will come down to prioritization. Your exam is the gateway to METU, so make sure that‚Äôs your main focus until it‚Äôs done. But coding can act as a mental refresh so use it as a productive break from studying. Consistency beats intensity so it‚Äôs better to code a little regularly than to burn out trying to do everything at once.

Then expose the Pi server to the internet however, e.g. using Cloudflare.\n\nFor a more robust setup, I'd go with an ESP32 (capable of deep sleep when idle) to read the button, which sends a notification to a backend API server, which updates a separate static web server.

        "body": "I'm going to disagree with the other two posters a *bit*, and post my own definition. Firstly, you absolutely, 100% should learn classes. They are used everywhere in every facet of programming, *including* Frontend Dev. Modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Lit, etc. use them, so they're absolutely necessary to have at least a basic grasp of.\n\nI'd also disagree that the \"description of an object is called a CLASS\". This is like...90% accurate, but there's a small bit of distinction that I think is important.\n\n# Classes and Objects\n\nFirstly, let's define what the word \"object\" means. I like to think of an object in programming as a *noun*; it's a \"thing\". It has can have some **adjectives** that describe it (it's \"old\" or \"blue\") and it can have some **verbs** that it can do (it can \"drive\" or \"honk\"). It's also got a name usually that describes it (so we can refer to that \"thing\"), and often times we can say that it's a particular **kind** of thing. \n\nNow, instead of using the words \"adjective\", \"verb\", and \"kind\", let's replace those with more programmy words:\n - `property`: properties are the adjectives. They describe something about the object. Some of those properties can be changed (I may get taller or shorter as I age); other properties cannot change (I will always have been born in my hometown; that cannot change). Generally speaking, properties don't \"do\" anything; they're just descriptors. Each property has a \"key\" (what it is) and a value. For example, our car has a property with key \"color\" and value \"blue\".\n - `method`: Methods are the verbs, and they usually have a pair of parentheses somewhere in their name. I can `program()`. I can `write(message)` (write a message). I cannot `fly()` (that's not one of my methods!).\n - `class`: The class of an object is, roughly speaking, its _type_. I am a human (my class is Human). The `old`, `blue` thing that can `drive()` is an object of type `Car`. All objects of a particular type are defined as having certain methods and properties. Classes can also be thought of as \"templates\" for objects. I want an object that fits the template \"car\" (i.e., does things a car can do), so I'll use the Car class.\n\nHere's an example of a class in JavaScript:\n\n```\nclass Car {\n  constructor(color, age){\n    //roughly speaking here, `this` refers to the object we're talking about.\n    this.color = color;\n    this.age = age;\n  }\n\n  drive() {\n    alert('vroooom!');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd to use this class, I'd do something like this:\n\n```\nconst myCar = new Car('blue', 'old');\n\nconsole.log(myCar.color);//'blue'\n```\n\nSo why would I disagree that the description of an object is a class? Well, in describing that old blue car, I'd... well I'd describe it exactly that. An old, blue car. _However_, the adjectives \"old\" and \"blue\" are _not part of the class_! Instead, they're values (see above). Instead, a class describes a _template_ for an object, not that actual, specific object. Every person alive has an `age` property and a `placeOfBirth` property, but mine is almost certainly different from, say, yours. \n\n# Why\n\nClasses allow us to organize our data in a paradigm of programming known as Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It's not the _only_ paradigm, but it's a pretty popular one. Classes:\n - Allow us to define a particular behavior _once_ and then reuse that behavior\n - Can be \"extended\". For example, I might have a `Pet` class with properties like `hungerLevel` or methods like `makeSound()`, and then I might \"extend\" that class with something like a `Dog` class (with a `bark()` method), or a `Fish` class (with a `splash()` method). Again, this allows us to define certain, common behaviors only once!\n\nThe first point is particular important. Imagine if every time a person signed up for FaceBook, a team of programmers had to write functions to deal with that person's account. Oh, /u/Maleficent_Speech289 signed up? We'll need to write a `login()` and `getPictures()` and `postMessage()` method for them! Instead, with classes, you can just say: \n\n```\nconst someUser = new User('Maleficent_Speech289');\nsomeUser.getPictures(); //this behavior is already defined, so we can just use it!\n```\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nYou absolutely, 100% need to know classes as a programmer. It doesn't matter if you're new, senior, or somewhere in between; you'll need to know them at some point, and it's never too early to start learning them. Anyone that hires you will expect you to have clean, structured code, and while there are other programming paradigms, OOP is one of the most popular to the point that it's kinda a \"default\".",

        "body": "In JS, a class, aka object, is not really an object, it is ***a prototype ***  This difference was emphasized in many older books but has been forgotten since around 2012.   The last book I know of that adheres to this differentiation though the author did not explain the difference at all was the book Javascript the Good Parts by Douglas Crawford.  \n\nYou should think of a prototype as a ***generalized object/class***, it is a ***meta-class*** so to speak.   This was something discussed in a very old book called The Art of the Metaobject Protocol by Gregor Kiczales.   \n\nA typical object is very easy to understand as others have no doubt explained to you already.  It is basically a list of data and a list of methods that operates on those data and those data only.   You can create a new type of object from an existing object by inheriting all of its data and methods + nee ones you specified.  You should think in your mind as a circle engulfed by a bigger circle where the smaller circle is the old and the big circle now containing the smaller circle is the new.  \n\nThis is pretty much all you can do with objects if JS were really an object-oriented language like Java -- I wrote some stuff bashing Java the other day, people interested should search for the keyword Scratch in my comment history.  I basically argued why Scratch is better than Java, but that's just a click-bait title.  \n\nWith prototype, the relationship between the old and the new is not a circle in a circle but two circles connected by a line.  Yep, that's it.  We are done.\n\nTo truly appreciate the difference, you have to ask what happens during the ***construction of a new new-object***.  In the circle-in-circle model, you simply get another circle-in-circle.  \n\nHowever in JS, creating another circle-line-circle new-object can be done in ***two ways***, hence all the weird constructors in JS.  When you use the keyword 'class' you are creating a brand new circle-line-circle.  This is the standard method since ECMA6.  However there is an older method using the keyword 'new\".  \n\nWith 'new', you do not get another circle-line-circle, you get a new circle attached to the existing circle-line-circle, and the relationship is a triangle.  The you have circle-line-Circle-line-circle where Circle represents the old-object and the two 'circle's are the created new-objects. \n\nWhy does this matter?  This means both child (new-objects) share the same parent.  And either one can ***modify the parent's data or add new methods to the parent*** and that information will be propagated to the other child.  This is an important feature because it means you can modify the parent ***at run time.***  You can use this for all sorts of purposes.  \n\nIt would take too long to explain all the things you can do with this, just consult the book I mentioned or use your imagination.  \n\nI do want to mention something that is not in the book and I do not believe it is implemented anywhere.  In JS at least you can do it pretty easily.   Imagine now you go to the new 'class' constructor and you use that to create another circle-line-Circle-line-cicrle, now you have two families of the same objects, but they can follow different ***dynamic*** paths during program run time to become something else entirely.  One obvious application would be for games where you have different creatures from different families but as they evolve, they can split off from the main tree.  But, it can even go back through its ancestor tree and start ***rewriting history.***\n\nAnyway, this is long enough.\n\ne:  JS was originally derived from Scheme and the book was written for LISP based language which is the root of Scheme.  The creator of JS wanted to create a Scheme language to be used as the scripting language for the then best browser Netscape.  However, Java had just taken off and was seen as the future of the programming world.  So the investors of Netscape insisted on a ***java-like*** language thinking it would make JS compatible with Java in the future.  \n\nObviously you should never let non-tech people make tech decisions.  So the JS creator took the matter into his own hand and created a ***java-look-alike***.  It looks like Java but it has nothing to do with Java, it is way better because it runs on Scheme under the hood.   Yes, that's all it is.  He took a Scheme engine and created a cosmetic layer over it.  This was how he created JS in 3 days.   And God took 7 days to create the Universe.  Not too shabby.",

        "body": "ARM has a lot of documentation both in PDF and HTML form for AArch64, however modern architectures are completely different beasts compared to the 8086. For example on ARMv8 and above there are 4 privilege levels, which they call Exception Levels, with EL0 being the unprivileged level under which regular user applications execute, EL1 being intended for kernel supervisors, EL2 being intended for virtual machine hypervisors, and EL3 being intended for firmware security monitors.\n\nOn macOS you only have access up to EL2, and that requires using either the Hypervisor or Virtualization frameworks to create a virtualization environment (the Virtualization framework is a very high level virtual machine implementation on top of the Hypervisor framework), but you can run unrestricted EL3 code on all AArch64 Raspberry Pi models, so if you're interested in privileged bare-metal development, the Raspberry Pi is likely your best option. On the other hand, M4 Macs are already on ARMv9, which is pretty similar to ARMv8 as far as unprivileged code is concerned but significantly different for privileged code as many system registers were added, changed, and removed since ARMv8, plus the M4 in particular also has 512-bit Scalable Matrix Extension support, so depending on what you want to do, that may or may not be appealing to you.\n\nGeneral purpose AArch32 and AArch64 HTML documentation:\n\n* [ARMv6M, ARMv7, and ARMv8 assembly reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/latest/);\n* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 instruction set architecture](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/latest/)\n* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 system registers](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0601/latest/)\n\nDocumentation specific to the SoCs used by the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 and their derivatives:\n\n* [Cortex A72 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100095/latest/)\n* [Cortex A76 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100798/latest/);\n* [ Generic Interrupt Controller core reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0471/latest/);\n* [Generic Interrupt Controller v2 specific reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0048/latest/);\n* [PrimeCell 0111 UART](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0183/latest/);\n* [BCM2711 datasheet (Pi 4)](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/bcm2711/bcm2711-peripherals.pdf).\n\nOther resources:\n\n* [Bare-metal section of the Raspberry Pi forums (I help there sometimes under the same name as my reddit account)](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewforum.php?f=72&sid=de4c2c97b2b1372281ef64d6aed3dc5f);\n* [Tutorial that got my feet wet on AArch64 (I already had experience with AArch32 from decades ago)](https://www.rpi4os.com/);\n* [Rust HDMI audio driver that I made for the Pi 4 and 5](https://github.com/CodexTextor/rpi-hdmi) (will not work on the BCM2712 D0 stepping SoC used on models of the Pi 5 introduced after I wrote that code because the physical addresses of the hardware are different).\n\nNote that there's no public official documentation for the BCM2712 SoCs of the Raspberry Pi 5, so all my code targeting that platform is based on my own reverse-engineering research effort that included reading the official Linux driver code from Broadcom, messing around with hardware registers on Linux to figure out how they work with a proper driver, and deriving knowledge from my experience with and available documentation for the BCM2711 SoC of the Pi 4, since there was very little community work done on this front when I got my first Pi 5. If you go the Raspberry Pi route I also recommend getting the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe, installing OpenOCD, and reading [this thread](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=362067) on the Raspberry Pi forums for the OpenOCD script.\n\nAs for setting up the environment for native development on macOS, you don't really need much beyond Xcode's command-line tools, which you can install by typing:\n\n    xcode-select --install\n\nAnd then following the on-screen instructions.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Added Xcode command-line suggestion.",

Repeatedly search for the character `s1[0]` in `s2`\n2. For each match, it checks whether the substring of `s2` starting at that point actually equals `s1`\n\nThe trick is that instead of those steps being implemented directly as loops, they're implemented by calling methods on `std::char_traits<char>`, which in turn call the standard C library functions `memchr` and `memcmp`, respectively.\n\nAnd depending on the platform, those functions in turn can be implemented using highly-optimized assembly code, which is likely faster than anything you would write by hand in C++.  For instance, on x86_64 Linux with glibc, `memchr` has various different implementations using SSE2, AVX2 or EVEX SIMD instructions, depending on which CPU features are detected at runtime.",

Steve wrote the entire program in 6502 Assembly - on paper - then hand-translated everything in the numeric machine code that then could be loaded on the Apple computers. You can find plenty information on how Steve did it on the internet.\n\nWhen I learnt 8051 Assembly in my degree program we initially also learnt to hand-translate the Mnemonics into machine code and vice versa. Can highly recommend to learn that with simpler CPUs, like the 6502, the Zilog Z-80, or the 8051/8031/8080 series Microcontrollers.\n\nAssembly is just a 1:1 translation of machine code and therefore is closest to hardware.",

Well the first assembler would have been written in machine code. With the tedium of converting the bytes of the assembly code into something you could work with to eventually get machine code out. But the CPU you design in the book doesn't have file access etc. And I think the book is more interested in teaching the fundamentals of an assembler, rather than how to do that in pure machine code.

Covers everything from basics to connecting with databases and building REST APIs.\n\nAlso, since you're coming from a React background, you might want to consider the MERN stack instead of jumping straight to Java/Spring Boot. Node.js with Express is way easier to pick up when you already know JavaScript, and you can focus on learning backend concepts without learning a whole new language at the same time.\n\nAt Metana we actually see this transition a lot. Frontend devs wanting to go full stack. Most find it easier to stick with JavaScript ecosystem first (Node/Express) then maybe explore Java later if needed. But if your project specifically needs Spring Boot or you're targeting Java jobs, then go for it.\n\nEither way, the key is building that project while you learn. Don't just do tutorials tho. Actually build your backend API as you go through the course material. You'll learn way faster that way.",

The important thing for me is to finish logical sections I start (whether that's a chapter, section etc.) and keep track of which sections I've already read (I usually mark up the contents page if it's my book, but you can do something separate if you want/need to keep it unmarked etc.).\n\nYou will forget what you read unless you code along, and then ***apply*** what you learn.

A lot of people's philosophies do not recommend learning from books, rather than experience. I believe a healthy dose of both is best. Books provide a central organized source of information, interpreted usually by a well experienced author, so you get insight along with it. But I also believe that programming books \"work\" best when you also apply what you've learned to projects. It's like combining book smarts with street smarts. I'm currently reading two very large programming books right now, which I've been enjoying very much. But naturally, I'm a book person. A book worm. So in the end, I always like reading books.",

The rise in AI-generated content has blurred the lines of authenticity in online discussions. Here are a few reasons why it might *feel* like that:\n\n# üß† Why Posts Might Feel AI-Generated\n\n1. **Overly Polished Language** Posts are increasingly written in this weirdly structured, ‚Äúessay-like‚Äù format. People don‚Äôt usually talk like that on Reddit ‚Äî especially in tech circles where tone tends to be blunt, sarcastic, or informal.\n2. **Generic Advice & Vague Details** A lot of posts give surface-level advice or talk about issues in super broad terms without getting into the gritty technical details ‚Äî which is common with AI output unless prompted very specifically.\n3. **Repetitive Phrasing and Templates** You‚Äôll often see similar turns of phrase or story structures across different posts ‚Äî things like ‚ÄúAfter X years in the industry, I realized Y‚Äù or ‚ÄúAm I the only one who feels Z?‚Äù It starts to feel formulaic.\n4. **Influx of Low-Effort Engagement Farming** Some users (or bots) are using AI to mass-generate posts and comments to farm karma, drive traffic, or build fake authority on niche topics.\n\n# ü§ñ Signs a Post Might Be AI-Generated\n\n* Lacks personal anecdotes or uses generic placeholders.\n* Echoes common sentiments without adding anything new.\n* Oddly balanced tone: too formal but pretending to be casual, lol.\n* Uncanny ability to sit on the fence on controversial topics.\n* Unnatural use of üí© emojis.\n* Overuse of the em dash (‚Äî).\n\n# üß© You're Not \"Schizo\" ‚Äî You're Perceptive\n\nIt‚Äôs unsettling, yeah. And it *does* erode trust ‚Äî not just in content, but in online community culture itself. Part of Reddit‚Äôs value used to be real, lived experience and human nuance. If that‚Äôs being diluted, it makes total sense to question what you're reading and who's actually behind it.\n\nIf you're feeling disoriented by all this, it‚Äôs not paranoia ‚Äî it‚Äôs pattern recognition. You‚Äôre seeing a shift, and you‚Äôre trying to make sense of it. That‚Äôs a sane reaction.\n\nWant to talk about how to filter for more authentic content or spot AI in the wild?",

You could feel that every single crypto asset is bullshit, but even then I‚Äôm not sure you could deny that selling services to people who want to use and trade those assets isn‚Äôt a real business. I think Pok√©mon card investing is bullshit, but if someone built a website to facilitate buying and selling of cards and took in real revenue, I‚Äôd still call that a real business. And all of those trading venues and lending venues need developers, often to build rather complex products that can‚Äôt have much downtime.\n\nAn area that‚Äôs bigger than ever are stablecoins - crypto assets pegged to (generally) the US dollar. The companies that offer these digital assets hold things like US treasuries to back them, so the company can earn revenue off of the interest while also ensuring that each digital dollar can be redeemed for a US dollar. As far as crypto things go, these are probably the most useful. People in countries with volatile currencies and poor banking systems can now receive, hold, send, and earn interest on US dollars with just a phone and an internet connection. They can send them anywhere in the world and be paid from anywhere in the world. And with the crap going on with Steam and itch.io having to block NSFW games because of pressure from credit card companies, I‚Äôd argue we actually could really use a digital dollar that‚Äôs as free flowing and censorship resistant as a real life physical dollar. And all of the software that runs this, as well as the apps people use to engage with it, require software devs.\n\nSo they‚Äôre either doing that, or trying to pump out another meme coin. It‚Äôs a pretty harsh dichotomy imo.",

Decentralization is a complex problem to solve, and its difficult to figure out consensus with seemingly decentralized nodes in a network.\n\nIts why I got into block chain, because its just a cool computer science problem. I think the crypto hype is what has really killed it. And so it has made blockchain as a technology feel less legitimate. But its still fairly legit as a problem to solve. The issue is that its may not be solveable, or you can only have solutions with trade offs.\n\nI really see the same problem with AI adoptions. It also has some fundamental problems.

The PIP reasoning is disgusting too. In my case, I worked in the backbone for the entire company and was able to reduce total failures by 1.5%. That was across the entire company's AWS deployments. Yet somehow in the PIP they wanted me to reduce them by 3% or more, which is just disgusting. You put in the hard work and get rewarded with impossibly high expectations.

I'll hit em back with a \"Aight, I'm tied up right now. Get started on debugging, I'll sync up with you later\". This then very explicitly creates the expectation that they need to take a stab at it before we sync up.\n\nI find more often than not, if I invent a little bit of space, people manage to figure out their issues by themselves, or at least get further along and try various things.\n\nInstant gratification, and spoonfeeding people answers, is what cultivates this kind of culture where at the first sign of any sort of issue you immediately go to Person X. And when you've cultivated a culture like that.... why wouldn't they? Why in the world would I read through logs, find the error, google that error, and spend time figuring out what's wrong and how to fix it? There's no need for me to do that if I can send a message to Person X and get an answer dropped in my lap.\n\nNot everyone is coachable that way, and that way isn't an instant-fix either. It takes a lot of time. Way more time than if I just kept doing it myself and sending them answers. But I have significantly improved my work life when I've landed on teams with people like this by slowly but surely coaching them to do things on their own without just abruptly telling them to pound sand.\n\nIt makes a great story for interviews when asked about mentorship as well.",

Its impossible to estimate \"potential and problem-solving ability\" from a single interview. Companies were not hiring for specific tech stacks before because the demand outweighed the supply.\n\n Hiring juniors is always a bet and now companies have the luxury of choosing among a vast pool of them. Of course they will rather choose the guy who aligns somewhat with their tech stack rather than the guy whose only coding experience is C++ console programs. Risk is still there but at least the first guy wont need 2-3 months to start being productive.",

It was also my first developer job as well.  A lot of what I learned was self-taught since I had very little experience with APIs, databases, and frameworks initially. I was able to learn a lot, but one harsh reality I've realized is that there is a lot of stuff that I did that doesn't fit in with current industry standards and best practices. \n\nI've only gotten about 5 interviews over the last few months, and I've been struggling with the technical interviews as well. It's been eye-opening for me to see my shortcomings.  I've also questioned whether I'm still good enough to remain in this industry. For now, all I've been doing has been trying to better myself for what my role actually requires.  I've been doing courses, studying up on terminology, and I've even been studying my resume to make sure I can fully explain anything I did that's on it.\n\nEvery rejection is demoralizing, but for the interviews that I do get, I take it as a learning experience since it highlights another thing I need to work on.",

Write down answers to the top 20-30 common ones (‚Äútell me about yourself,‚Äù conflicts, mistakes, etc.).\n\n\\- For tech rounds, you don‚Äôt need to master everything. \\~100 leetcode mediums will carry you through most screens.

The broadness of the prep really messed with me too.\n\n\nI think I still would of been boned if I had to start over but know what I learned from this layoff.\n\n\nI know what you mean, I thought I was out of the industry too. Out of the 23 attempts I only got 2 offers, and one was laughably bad compared to what I used to have.¬†\n\n\nFor me specifically, even though every company was vastly different - I eventually kind of caught on there is overlap to an extent. Try to identify that, and leave the rest up to chance.\n\n\nThe reality is you have to get 90-100% on the \"exams\" and your competition has to screw up at our YOE ( tie breakers will usually go to most YOE or whoever stood out more). I had more than one job give me feedback that I actually did really good during the interviews, but my competition would have triple my experience and have a similar performance. I lost twice for a 6 round top 2 finalist.. right before I started my job I nailed round 3/4 for a 130k remote job then ghosted. It's just unfair lol.¬†\n\n\nThe job I got my final competition was 20 yoe, 8 yoe, 15 yoe. I won at 3 yoe because I was the only one who solved the coding challenge, answered every question correct, AND they liked me / personality fit went well. It took 23 times to set up that scenario. That day was crazy. I had FIVE onsites in a week for 4 companies. I had TWO onsites the day I finally won one stupid job. Funny part is it was the one I thought I did bad on because their API challenge was absolutely stupid. They were like YOU HAVE 7 MINUTES TO MAKE A GET REQUEST API ON THIS CODEBASE HERES A LAPTOP.\n\n\nI was like ??. I survived being nearly interrogated by 3 men answering every question and had to completely switch gears. I've failed so many interviews due to stress and pressure. This particular time I think I was jaded that I had so many onsites in a week and had to go drive to my 2nd one literally right after this I took a breath and started. I talked out loud my thoughts, reiterating the REST pattern of controller implementation repostiory layers. I copied a different GET request in that file and started asking questions about the method and made the params or wrote comments what I wanted to do. I updated the same in the interface/model. I went into the repository layer and just copied how they're connecting to the DB and started making it. I ran out of time and couldn't make it run. Left going screw this place.\n\n\nTurns out I did the best and got further than the others... But the catch was it's a government job so it took 3 MONTHS to get a start date due to a lot of background checks.\n\n\n\nFor me personally, I wasn't getting leetcode that often towards the end. I did lose at least 3 positions because of failing the leetcode, but most of them didn't have it. I lost 2 positions to system design. What I did get almost consistently was this \"tech trivia\" interviews in my market.¬†\n\n\nAsking very specific concepts or language questions and building off off it. I used free tier LLM's to give me 20-30 questions and go in depth prompting and trying to understand all the concepts. I would use the mic feature to simulate interview questions 1 by 1 and get feedback. I found that greatly helped me pass that round even if it wasn't perfect.\n\n\nTurns out some companies were getting questions from the same bank as me, and I would occasionally get some verbatim things I studied. Like what is async and go into detail. What is a Singleton. How would you debug an expensive SQL query. I also found by simulating those questions I had a higher chance of coming up with at least a passable sounding answer.\n\n\nI still suck at it - but to work on the little debugging / API / leetcode easiest / fill in the methods.. I went and did leetcode easy problems and put a timer for 10 minutes. My goal was to talk out loud and explain everything, and make a solution, test, run. In those simulations I could still feel pressure even then. Being at 8-9 minutes and I missed an edgecase and scrambling to fix it.¬†\n\n\nI think that was the right path to work on the pressure part. If you're struggling specifically with crud api's I'd use LLM's to help you make a simple crud in your stack and study it. You could time urself to make a stupid crud or analyze a piece of code it generated / something open source ( I didn't end up doing this)\n\n\nSo in return, I basically was like my odds of passing are lower if I get Leetcode med or hard, system design, or something I haven't seen before. It's just too vast. You do want to work on it all but if I were to go again, id try to perfect a \"section\" of the interview during downtime, and cram like hell for whatever the current interview is gonna be.\n\n\nIt still sucks, I don't know the answer. I still can't believe I went thru all that. My actual job a month in isn't easy but it's kinda laughable how much lower expectations are vs the interview I had there. I'm getting a month to build a GET request, make test cases, consume it on the front end. Not 7 minutes... Lol\n\n\nI think if I had 6 more months to study I'd be closer to a top candidate but realistically I just need more resume experience for right now.",

Understanding data pipelines etc is something I believe is very valuable if that is what you‚Äôre interested in, and I‚Äôm always grateful to have other devs on the team with some understanding of what I do (React) because it means we can articulate needs ro one another easier (which is why breadth is so important)",

The company has 3 major versions, and 12 minor versions, with compatible and incompatible libraries in 38 services, and issues popping up weekly that need to be addressed. Your experience in other tech is cool, but not directly applicable to the needs.\n\nConversely, if a job needs someone who can solve some microservices problems in Golang, TypeScript, C#, and Java, with occasional database management work in MySQL and MongoDB from their early startup days, then a jack of all trades is going to be nifty. Especially now that someone wants to add Python and R to the mix for data stuff, and you're experienced in picking up new things to get the ball rolling until an expert is needed.\n\nThe real problem is proving you have any skills worth looking at in the first place.

I felt like I could give him a task and with only a little guidance, he would figure it out on his own get it done and was really quick to pick up on things. I also didn't have to explain things to him multiple times. He would complete things quickly and with the enthusiasm of someone still fresh in the field.\n\nDespite me never wanting an intern in the first place I ended up pushing to hire him after the internship ended and after he finished out his last semester in school. He is now with us full time and whenever raise time comes around, I'm asking my boss what if anything I can do to help him get a promotion/raise- the answer is usually nothing, but I want to keep him because he has proven himself to be super valuable to the team and I know that earlier on in your career is when you can make moves to other companies for the biggest jumps in your career.\n\n  \nI guess to me what made the difference was that, he learned/improved quickly and was fairly independent. I didn't have to spell out each and every little step like I would to a chatgpt prompt. He had his own mind and could think through things instead of just follow my step by step instructions.",

You're establishing professional boundaries and making it clear that your working hours are 9-5, M-F. You'll be working 100% of your working hours.\n\nI don't know how cutthrough the consulting scene is, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but that's the advice I normally give to people suffering burnout. People always think in extremes. \"Put up with being miserable working 12 hour days\" vs \"Quit without anything lined up\".\n\nIn reality there's usually a less extreme option: \"Enforce your professional boundaries, and work 8 hour days, regardless of what's going on around you with the project and management\". And immediately start job searching with all that extra time.\n\nThe thing about that approach is even if that ruffles feathers, they usually don't fire you right away. They'll heckle you about your performance, they might PIP you, they'll desperately start looking for your replacement, maybe the client will drop you... but all that often takes months. Firing you outright is a much larger impact to the project than letting you work \"normal\" 8 hour days until they hire and train your replacement. It'd be a stupid management decision to react prematurely.\n\nSo in that time before they fire you... you're job searching *and* collecting a paycheck instead of draining your savings. And the best part of that approach is if they do end up firing you before you line something else up, you're *exactly* where you were about to put yourself voluntarily: Unemployed.\n\nThat said, at the end of the day quitting without something lined up isn't the end of the world. It's a calculated risk and an expense. If you decide that's worth it, go for it. If even after reducing your workday to 8 hours you're still feeling miserable, then that's likely not going to help, so quitting ASAP may be the best option for you.\n\nI'm surprised you lasted 3+ years of 12+ hour days... I would've be gone in month 1. WLB is my #1 priority. I'm a 9-5 employee. If I'm ever at a company where that's not sufficient, I take the above advice.",

From the company‚Äôs perspective, a billable hour is a billable hour, but overtime hours are expensive, so it‚Äôd be perfectly reasonable to work with your leadership chain to cut overtime and hire more people instead. If relying on overtime is widespread, you can probably even rally support from coworkers by getting everyone to complain to leadership simultaneously.\n\nThe time tracking thing doesn‚Äôt need to involve micromanaging. All they care about is for time to be plausably accounted for, you don‚Äôt need to annotate every tiny minute.

Then few stuff about SQL, what is pessimistic locking, what is optimistic locking and how does it work, write SQL for it, show me how to use it. What is a transaction, a dead lock, etc..\n\n4th round - system design.. model a system that solves this simple X real problem found in our domain. Just a chat basically.\n\n\n1st round quickly filters out people who don't have basic knowledge\n\n2nd round verifies skills in OOP, TDD, multithreading (locks, dead lock, race conditions).\n\n3rd round again verifies skills in OOP (bit redundant tbh), but then goes into the DB and verifies that you actually know what is going on under the framework\n\n4th round verifies that you know more high-level architecture stuff.. message queues, redundancy, gateway/api/reverse-proxy, sharding... and that you can think bigger than just a few classes.\n\nI think these 4 rounds could be compressed in just 3 and be just as effective. Phone call was 15 minutes, the 3 rounds were a little more than 1 hour each. A total of roughly 5 hours that could be shortened to 3.5 or 4. I am very confident this process filters out 100% of the people who can't do the job. They verify all the skills needed to do the daily work that people apply every day. Perfect, imho. I don't get why it is so difficult for other companies to do the same.\n\nThis process is applied by a tech unicorn, so it definitely works at scale too..",

Employers have so much to choose from, they'll easily find someone who has experience with the stack they use and will be productive on day 1.\n\nGiven that you are a recent grad, you have no previous job but you have your coursework, your projects, your interests.

Similar scandals have surfaced, such as TCS‚Äôs 2023 bribery purge and ongoing DOJ prosecutions targeting visa fraud and kickback schemes.\n\nThe situation also intersects with tightened H-1B visa regulations, designed to curb fraud in staffing practices.

They can infer that from gaps between one job to another. \n3. I don't think the awards section is relevant personally. If you want to keep it for sentimental reasons then I'd suggest having it last. \n4. You have far too much job experience to still warrant having projects in my opinion. I'd remove them. \n5. Add more information on the jobs that you had. Simply listing the jobs is not enough. Explicitly mention the technologies and tools used and what projects you did. \n6. Languages is not necessary in my opinion. Most applications ask for this before you input your resume. But it could be different for you, If so, then it can be kept. But I'd make it a single line.\n\nAs for the job application, I prefer Indeed to LinkedIn personally and got my last job through there. Also I'd suggest applying on the company website whenever possible, companies have separate pipelines for applications and pay attention to the ones that come in through their website. I'd also say that don't just fire off the same resume hundreds of times. Tweak it slightly for every single job and ensure that it meets all of the minimum and most of the preferred qualifications. \n\nAlso, I somewhat disagree with what another user on here said, the goal of your resume nowadays is to pass the ATS, not talk to a live person. Your resume should obviously be in human readable format but it should be jam packed with enough key words from the job description to get a high enough match and pass the ATS. After passing the ATS, you just have to convince a real human to hire you... which is far easier than some automated check that fails damn near everyone.",

The compliments were crazy like, Ah you're angel, you're so smart, you're so handsome, etc etc. It was a LOT from different people and honestly I felt like a celebrity there.\n\nJapan has a heiarchy of age and mentorship. Japanese call this like a Senpai-Kouhai relationship.  Basically they view their job as an older person or mentor to guide you, treat you, and sort of mold you as best they can. It can be weird from a westerner perspective because work time is work time and there's no \"relationship\" besides training you. \n\nI personally wouldn't be alarmed by this behavior but I'd still maintain distance. A lot of these type of people are  fascinated with having foreign friends. it's largely a selfish relationship for them.

In addition to talking about what was involved in coding the dashboard, you should talk about things like: why your company wanted this dashboard built, how you worked with the design team to build your dashboard to their design spec, how you wrote unit/functional/e2e tests and UATed your dashboard prior to deploy, how you used feature flagging and log monitoring to ensure a successful deploy, and what business goals were accomplished after you successfully deployed your dashboard.

It's mostly a lose-lose proposition for them at the point where you've already left and began work for their client. If the company also had some kind of non-solicitation agreement with your agency, that's not really _your_ problem.\n\nI was in a similar position to you and the non-solicitation clause did not prevent me from joining the client company (a global 500).

Account for that since this is a learning experience you will not be in an out in 40 hours. Dedicate this time to just learning what you dont know. Do your best not to get too frustrated with yourself if you don't understand something. Practice reading code. This is such a separate skill from writing code. Given that you are junior it may or may not be clear what things are learnable via self teaching and what things are specific to your job/team/company that you just wouldn't know if someone didn't tell you. I wasted a lot of time trying to deduce what was going on when a lot of my lack of understanding was about things I couldn't have possibly known and just needed someone to tell me. Try to find a few mentors on your team that you can ask these questions to. No person is an island in software engineering.¬†",

But otherwise try not to ask people for help until you‚Äôve gotten to a point where you think the person you‚Äôre asking will even struggle to answer it.\n\nEarly in my career I did this because I was always afraid to reveal what I didn‚Äôt know, but after gaining some experience I‚Äôve noticed that the amount of time/effort a person puts into solving something before reaching out for help is a huge indicator of how much they‚Äôre going to succeed.\n\ntl;dr\nYes, it‚Äôs normal especially for your first job.\nMake sure that when you reach out for help, and someone asks, ‚ÄúWhat did you try already?‚Äù you will be able to answer without feeling lazy and embarrassed.\n\nIf people are telling you that you‚Äôre asking good questions, that‚Äôs actually a very good sign.",

I could go into the issues with advice subreddits in particular.... but I don't need to to make my point. Dont make major life decisions off anecdotes you read on *any* subreddits, doesn't matter which one.\n\nIf you want to pursue CS, pursue CS.\n\nThere are *plenty* of new grads that are lining up jobs just fine. You know where they are? Not on a CS Careers Questions subreddit. They're not here talking about how easy their job search was. They're enjoying their life.\n\nThe unemployment rate for new CS grads is 6.1%. While that number is high, and puts us in the top 10 for highest unemployment rates by degree.... That still means 93.9% of CS new grads are employed.\n\nThe underemployment rate for new CS grads is 16.5%. This is the number of people employed in a job that utilizes their college degree. So it filters out the people that gave up and went to McDonalds. *This* number for us puts us in the *bottom 5* for all degrees regarding underemployment. We're doing pretty damn well. Or I should say 83.5% of us are doing pretty damn well.\n\nThe 6.1%? The 16.5%? Those are the people that make up the majority of an advice subreddit's demographic, *because they need advice.* The 93.9% and 83.5% aren't normally posting here. And when they do (hello, it's me), they often get downvoted because it hurts to hear that you're in the bottom 16.5% of the industry. I understand it hurts to hear that, that percentage translates into a lot of people, but it's something people need to hear.\n\nAnd people not in the industry at all, like you, shouldn't be blinded by those peoples experiences.",

Was it to see how well I would design a system or was it on whether I read a book?\n\nTo see if you can regurgitate what you memorized on Youtube. And be a good talker. Be able to convince the other side you know everything from ground up and you are a rock star. And sound super organized.\n\n>I've never considered idempotency or what a hash ring is or what golden invariants are. I've never thought about CAP theorem, just that available and consistent is good. Requirements get passed to us by product managers, we never make them from a 5 minute conversation with the BA or stakeholder.\n\nThis is what my friends (senior engineers) at Google told me.\n\n\"We just use Spanner for everything. For all practical purposes, Spanner is highly available, highly consistent (basically instant so the 'eventual' part is just theory for practical purposes), and infinite scale.\"\n\nSo ya... now, CAP theorem states that in a real world, we have to choose Availability or Consistency as first priority. And that is true. But generally the idea is if you are dealing with money especially in banks, then choose Consistency. Otherwise, basically all the time Availability is fine.\n\nIn the real world? Unless you work at Amazon/Google scale, you are going to use postgres/mysql anyways. And even at those big tech firms sql databases are used in many teams.\n\nAs for what kind of databases I worked over so far: postgresql, mysql, mongodb, cassandra\n\nAlmost all companies using MongoDB are using MongoDB for no reason than \"it's webscale\" meme. It's tech debt. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs)\n\nUse case for Cassandra/DynamoDb is niche overall.\n\nScale? Dude, sql databases have run the world forever. Credit cards before the days of DynamoDB worked everywhere around the world. Everyone was swiping left and right. Big banks hold records of swipes, withdrawals, deposits, etc globally. Those dumb Youtube videos during covid by these juniors trying to gain views about high writes == nosql (kind of true but whatever)? sql databases can when writes are properly batched in theory go over a million insert per second though in reality, let's say 10k insert per second. 10k insert per second is 10\\^5 \\* 10\\^5 sec a day = 10\\^10 inserts a day aka 10 billion rows a day.\n\nSchemaless? Unless you are dealing with e-commerce, fraud, machine learning, etc., you can shove in your metadata to JSONB on postgresql.\n\nACID vs BASE? DynamoDB supports ACID as well. You can have sql databases have BASE like properties. Especially mysql in which you can change engine.\n\nBiggest differences are really nosql databases tend to be LSM tree oriented while sql databases tend to be B tree oriented. But DynamoDB on its sort key is B tree oriented as well.\n\nSharding? SQL can have auto sharding. Though it is true in practice (this part I agree since I have not used auto sharding in my jobs) you do have to worry about sharding on SQL. But like what? A few days a year or two for the team once everythings set up? Ya, nonissue.\n\nIt's all a clownfest at this point with each databases trying to emulate parts of the other database as well.\n\n**System Design Interview crap made more sense back when hardware was limited. Nowadays, we can have Redis instance with over half a terrabyte RAM. Many times, we can just chug the entire useful parts of database to the whole Redis.**\n\n  \nNow caching? Lol wait till you learn DynamoDB handles that for you if you are willing to pay extra. DynamoDB comes with caching by a click of a button so you don't need to handle a separate Redis instance. Just pay more money to AWS. All these \"scale problems\" you see in system design interviews are basically being all solved by Cloud providers. Cloud providers are not stupid. AWS needs to make more money. Why not just add more features to address all the known system design workarounds of the past?",

There's a reason engineers at tech firms make 7 figures from here.\n\nThe whole idea is as you gain more 'experience' in the real world, the way you 'talk' changes.

It's just another round to fake.\n\nPlus, if you talked about using DynamoDB for payment transactions half a decade ago, then depending on interviewer, you would have been rejected anyways. Same idea about once you calculate both read and write and determine you can for use case use postgresql for small schemaless values. It's really dumb so ya... very very very subjective.",

Do-able in days), completely irrelevant to the job, etc?\n\nExplicit IQ tests are illegal and so this interview format is the closest to check someone's puzzle matching abilities. \n\nAnd no one can know who is a better hire over another without seeing the individual at the actual job (on payroll) for at least over half a year.\n\nOutside many LC Hards (which is just bullshit and only there for filtering because of supply/demand), most LC Easy and Medium are things I would expect a competent junior could do with prep. The \"prep\" is known to everyone (as fair as possible) and scalable (an individual does not need to study per role per company). From there given there's finite time, I can also get someone's thought process and communication. And most importantly, pattern matching skills (which is honestly some of the most important skills on the actual job). Let alone LC at its fundamentals tests on the very basic concepts I would expect every CS grad should know like classes, hashmap, set, bfs/dfs, stack/queue. On an ideal interview even if the candidate cannot think of the solution, the candidate should be able to work with the interviewer to the solution (indirectly shows how adaptable the candidate is to the actual workers there).\n\nFortunately, very very few firms give actual LC \"Hards\" directly w/o help. And those that do give the well known handful of LC Hards that can be studied for. If you are applying to Uber and Uber pays a massive paycheck, then of course you should expect artificially high standards because everyone's applying but there's only a few positions available. Most firms to this day especially nontech give LC Easy or Easy Medium. Something as simple as checking if a string is a palindrome or if the paranthesis are valid.\n\nSome companies do take home assignments on top as a byproduct. But the problem with take home is individuals have to code in a language they are not comfortable with and spend many hours (because other candidates will put in many hours regardless of what the expectation claims). But the reject from the hiring side is decided in seconds or minutes at most. It's extremely unfair from the candidate side. \n\nSo ya... It's process of rational elimination. There's no other scalable option today that this field has.\n\nOne could argue we should have some standardized test that gives out a score like the SAT. Well... that's basically what codesignal is nowadays.",

I am a fullstack engineer and the biggest trouble I had with personal projects is the designs of my pages. I now can get AI to come up with a theme, a design, a layout, an admin dashboard, a home page and everything for me to use as a basis to build on and bounce my own ideas off.\n\nAlthough I think great design is unbelievably valuable, I think good design is fairly self evident. I mean, I can tell you if a site is well designed  - so can my mother. I dont think its difficult for AI to grasp this concept and produce designs for you. Almost all sites have at the very least the same layout; search bar at the top, nav bar top right/left and so on. Beyond this and the small design changes between different sites, I cant see design needing to be done in the way it is now. My team at work no longer needs the amount of designers we have - we got AI to design us a new view based on our existing views and it looked great.\n\nThe only exception to this (as always there are exceptions) will be exceptional designers in my option. Those designers who come up with new, unique almost game changing designs followed by many. AI wont be able to do this as easily, because AI needs a basis to train on. For example, in the late 2010's we got the gradient design you see on Stripe, with the scrolling animations as you scroll down. I think this design was game changing within the game of design, and so many sites followed this (I dont even know if Stripe were first tbh).\n\nI feel like if youre that good, original and can constantly change/push the bar, you'll be fine. However I would bet that most design teams will be shrinking in the coming 5-10 years.",

If your soon to be wife loves her job, you love your city, you're planning on having kids soon, etc... then that will need to take precedence. That might mean that you let Jan come and try to find a job in the meantime and tighten your belt a bit. Once kids come into the mix, you need to think long and hard about where you want to park for a second. \n\nDo you have any networks from college days? Is your manager understanding of the situation? If so, I would have a blunt conversation with them and ask them if you can use them as a reference or if they know anyone around the area that's hiring. Anyone you know that might be at a company, possibly hiring? The market is not great right now, and companies know this, so they're pulling whatever bullshit they can for attrition (my company is doing the same thing although maybe a softer version of yours). \n\nTo answer your question about your current knowledge, you might want to give yourself more credit. I doubt someone goes into a role for 4 years and \"everyone else is doing the work\". Have you received any promotions since starting? If that's the case, then you probably did something to get there. But the fact that you know Kotlin and Java is good, the industry is full of Java roles. So you could shift to Java (or C#... they're similar enough) and see what's out there. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's business to companies, but personal to you. This stuff can be really hard mentally and emotionally. I can't tell you which path to take, but if it were me, I would first ask yourself if you want to stay in mobile. If so, then focus on learning the rest of the process. Read up your code base, pick up more Kotlin, learn JetPack Composer, etc. If not, then consider a shift into learning more about Java and/or C# then try your luck there.\n\nMost importantly, talk to your partner about the move. If they will be happier where you are, then just explain that you'll be tightening belts until you can find something else. And if you need to, get a temporary job somewhere not related to CS until you can gnab that interview. \n\nAlso, look for any resources in the area for interview prep, resume editing, etc. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

My only alteration would be a gentle \"man, fuck Java.\" In most (all?) java projects you can add new code in Kotlin and either leave the old stuff alone or port it bit-by-bit. I've been doing Java on and off since 1.2 and other JVM-compatible languages are just leaving it in the dust because of how very very backward-compatible Java has to be. \n\nIt would be more beneficial, I think, to learn frameworks. OP, if you want to expand, learn a back-end framework like Spring Boot or Micronaut or Quarkus. Spring Boot is almost certainly the most sought-after, but if you know one you can pick the others up quickly.",

It‚Äôs easy to feel like you need to chase every cert or language, but that often leads to burnout without real progress. Instead, reflect on what you enjoyed most from your tech role. Was it the problem solving side of coding, or the precision and detail that comes with testing? If testing was your comfort zone, roles in QA automation or SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) could be a natural pivot. These roles often let you leverage your coding skills while staying close to quality focused work.\n\nIf you‚Äôre craving something new, IT certifications can definitely open doors but you‚Äôll want to be strategic. For example, if you go the cloud route, AWS Solutions Architect Associate or Azure Fundamentals ‚Üí Administrator can get you noticed quickly. If you lean toward cybersecurity, CompTIA Security+ is a great starting point and pairs well with your testing mindset. The key is to pick one lane, commit, and build a portfolio around it. Whether that‚Äôs small projects on GitHub, automation scripts, or even freelance gigs on platforms like Upwork. Freelancing can also be a good bridge though it won‚Äôt always be glamorous, but it‚Äôs real world experience that helps fill the gap on your resume.\n\nIf you can structure the next 6‚Äì12 months around one clear goal say, ‚Äútransition into cloud roles‚Äù or ‚Äúmove into automation testing‚Äù you‚Äôll find it much easier to cut through the fog.

From the company's perspective they are indeed paying you at around 45k when you add it all together. \n\nSecond, if you ask for more you should be prepared to justify it with actual numbers. You need to prove in a quantifiable way that you are bringing value to company through what you are doing.

What you do is you get some experience at one place for a minimum of one year or possibly two and then you move on. Job hopping is how you make more money asking for more in the next gig. After 2 years you could probably just apply for mid-level roles asking for 60 or 70K. Do another 2 years and then ask for 90k. Then after you've gotten some decent amount of experience, join r/ overemployed and double your salary to about 200k. Profit.",
