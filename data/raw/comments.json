Well, yeah, that's a solution that is pretty much guaranteed to cause a ton of DQ problems.  As opposed to having the source system publish domain objects that are locked down with data contracts.\n   * Data engineers build almost no quality-control tests, no unit testing, no reconciliation checks, no anomaly-detection, and no field transform audits to track changes over time.  dbt and great expectations are generally poor tooling that only address a fraction of this.\n   * Product managers, given zero push from engineering, leave out all considerations of data quality - no SLOs, no dashboards, no investment.  Which means it falls 100% on the engineer's heads.\n\nIt doesn't have to be that way.  But data engineers need to be better informed about DQ and push hard for architectures, tools, and processes they need.",

The way they do so is perfect for them.\n\nMarketing want a single customer view. Neither line of business collect the data in a form that allows comparison. You now have a data quality problem.\n\nThe only way I have found to improve the data quality is to fix it at source. You do this by making the down stream data vital to the earnings of both lines of business.  Customers get pissed off because, as far as they are concerned they are buying from company X. They couldn't give 2 hoots for the fact they bought product line A which is different from product line B. \nAs customer retention is far easier than customer recruitment,  anything that looses customers is very much frowned upon.",

And no we cannot bring on help at this time. And no I cannot put new work on hold because I (the boss) cannot say no.\n\n\\- Everything is fine, your other team mates (who are work-a-holics) are meeting deadlines, why are you complaining.\n\n\\- A general lack of boundaries by your boss, management, or team mates to say it can wait til tomorrow for stuff that legitimately is not critical\n\nI have some or all of the above at all of my jobs. When you have a boss who won't advocate for the team it really makes everything bad. At my one job (a 200 head count startup) I was getting calls from the CTO at 8 PM at night to ask about what filters we were using for our SMS notifications. Mind you, the SMS notification job ran at 3 PM. He could have just asked me the next morning in the office. The problem is once you give into this type of nonsense it is hard to get people to back off and respect your boundaries.\n\nI now have a job with a great boss that sets clear boundaries. Maybe once in 4 years have I had an emergency call while on PTO or during off hours. And in this case it was a legitimate emergency and I was given extra time off to compensate. Sometimes we still fall into the \"get it out the door we'll fix problems later\" cycle, but at least my current boss sets some sprints aside to eventually address these issues.\n\ntldr: sounds like your company has management problems and doesn't respect boundaries. Unfortunately you either have to deal with it or probably find somewhere else.",

Documents in old school doc repos like Documentum are modeled with their document models, basically metadata. All kinds of data items and sets of items can be semantically modeled using OWL, RDF or whatever ontology language. Ldap is modeled in whole part containment models + keys. Object databases tend to use class diagram like models because they work well with UML, even if schema is optional or not a thing. The list goes on. everything is modelable to some degree.

Then pickup data modeling which is the hardest skill to obtain, many at senior levels fail that round. Sometimes, can only come with experience. Then onto distributed compute and storage. At last, python and cloud skills. Don't focus on tools, rather focus on the fundamental concepts, processes, standards and conventions are important for sustainable career.\n\nOnce you have the above, those can be applied to any domain since your base is very strong.

        "body": "What you're describing is roughly how I'd define \"business intelligence\" (as in r/BusinessIntelligence). BI for short.\n\nData engineering can be, and often should be, a part of doing BI, but doesn't strictly have to be (depending a bit how you define DE, which is a different controversial topic). And DE is also applicable to situations that aren't BI. \n\nAnd BI is more than just DE, as you've observed - choosing how to model the data uniformly, for example, isn't really DE (IMO), although many data engineers also know a lot about data modelling.\n\nA platform that does all this stuff is traditionally called a data warehouse - and these days, that can encompass things that aren't strictly a data warehouse in a micro sense, but could still be described as a data warehouse in a macro sense. (Very little terminology in this area has really super-precise definitions that everyone agrees on.)\n\nNormalisation is actually not necessarily the way to go at all, for data you want to use for analytic purposes (\"making sense of data\"). _De_normalisation is often more appropriate. This is a huge discussion area within data modelling: a great place to start IMO is the book \"The Data Warehouse Toolkit\" by Kimball and Ross. Get the 3rd edition. This is not just a random book rec, it's a really foundational text in this field, covering \"dimensional data modelling\" aka \"star schemas\"\n Not everyone agrees with it but I don't think anyone should be critiquing it without having read it.\n\nIn terms of tooling and platforms, you can build your own stack using tools (often open source) that each focus on one smaller thing, doing it well; or there are big enterprise offerings that aim to provide everything you need in one package. Databricks and MS Fabric are two of those that get discussed quite a lot.\n\nWe settled on MS Fabric for my org (mainly my choice) and it's been a huge success for us. Though this is an unpopular opinion to have in this sub. It handles data ingestion from all our business systems, and everything that needs to happen thereafter through to Power BI reports.",

And it is because most of their business systems are built by software engineers.\n   * Sometimes they mature and separate the marketing/acquisition teams from the product teams and that is usually the death knell for centralizing product and marketing data.\n* That leads me to marketing data. It is usually the lowest requirement on the totem pole and at the same time it is the most difficult to deal with - it needs the most modeling, it doesn't ever rationalize (compared to accounting data), and its systems and tactics change the fastest. Almost no one ever gets this properly centralized/joined/productionized.\n* Sales-led companies (particularly the ones that don't have a digital product) revolve around the CRM (as they should, it is the *sales* system in a *sales-led* organization). Parallel efforts to pull data out of the CRM and join with other business systems are competitive for dollars and brainpower of decision makers. It is easier to build out the functionality of the CRM (apps and integrations) than it is to build out the data practice in the org outside the CRM.\n* In ecommerce of the last 6-7 years there has been trend toward Customer Data Platform, which I see as directly competitive to data warehouse. I have never met a company that said \"we are soooo glad we invested in that CDP\". Most never get fully integrated. Once they do, they realize that in order to automate reactions to customer behaviors, they need to understand customer behaviors, which is what they would have gotten if they'd invested in analysis of the data rather than orchestration.",

        "body": "I can only speak to my use case so I’ll describe that and why I like using mostly python based libraries. We build lots of econometric models to forecast supply and demand of various products. We ingest various datasets from a variety of public sources and paid vendors. The datasets are not very big for the most part and the ones that are very large we typically only need a subset for any given model run. So we essentially have 2 classes of data pipelines. (1) get external data and bring it internally and (2) our actual model which is technically just a pipeline of tons of transformations on internal data. \n\nI'll talk about (2) first. A single model run will load well over 100 internally stored datasets and run various transformations, statistical and matrix operations, overrides and adjustments etc to spit out a final forecast. This is all done in mostly pandas, but some polars and duckdb mixed in. The types and amount of operations we do (thousands of cross dataset interactions between hundreds of raw/intermediate datasets) could not easily be expressed in SQL, and in fact can’t even be easily expressed in polars operations. (See this thread for more info on why: https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/23938). We use frameworks similar to (but not) Apache Hamilton to organize the models into modular units of logic that can easily be swapped in and out and overrided for scenario analysis. These frameworks also provide caching so that we can run our pipelines incrementally and only rerun portions of the pipeline that have been affected by upstream changes (kinda like dbt).\n\nFor (1) this is much more standard ETL and there’s likely lots of solutions that we could successfully use. But what we’ve landed on is pure python scripts. Pretty much one simple script per data source using mostly requests and whatever database api we storing to (s3, sql server, etc). All these jobs are scheduled in airflow (using only the most barebones airflow functionality. Just a fancy cron for some minor dependency management) which gives us good visibility into operational health just from their standard task views. It’s a super simple set up, with basically no dependencies on large overarching systems or vendors besides Python/airflow. Basically free to operate and easy for anyone with basic Python experience to maintain. And it’s consistent with all our other processes in terms of SDLC. ",

In fact, I usually avoid them:\n\n   * transform tasks are just sitting on kubernetes, ECS, or lambda, waiting for SQS message that indicates a new file has landed on s3. \n   * These tasks may normally just have 1-10 containers processing data that arrives every few minutes, but can easily auto-scale up, sometimes to 1000-2000 containers like when I decide to reprocess historical data.\n   * They read the small s3 file and process one record at a time - with pretty much vanilla python.  The output is typically these days a parquet file.\n\nI use vanilla python rather than data frames because it's easier to write tests for the transform functions, easier to collect metrics on how many rows failed any given transform and then write out those stats when the file is complete.\n\nNow, is SQL, along with CTEs better than this?  Well, if your data is already in the database then it could be faster.  And it is easier to learn SQL than how to program - so SQL-based transforms could be built by non-engineers.  \n\nBut it will be more expensive, it won't scale as well, it will be much harder to test, and it can easily become very difficult to read - especially if non-engineers are building it.\n\nSo, I'd say there a few pros and a lot of cons.",

        "body": "You answered different questions than OP asked.\n\nQuestion 1: This cost so much, can I reduce price of my setup?\n\nBest way to solve this is to reduce price. \n\nAnother option is to move to flexible pricing, or something like that, but problem is still there with original setup, somebody has to pay $75k/month if OP doesn't do something about costs.\n\nQuestion 2: There is conflicting data in my systems. How do I solve this?\n\nYour solution: 'It's engineering problem' is moving problem to somebody else. On top of that their data is in their systems where users enter data. To fix that you need to combine data from different systems and make corrections to data based on one system, that's basic use case for DWH. It isn't always possible to force people to enter correct data to systems or correct it afterwards.\n\nI'm currently doing a project where customers has about 100 salespeople and they make mistakes all the time when entering their trades to ERP. It's way too costly to fix their mistakes afterwards to ERP and you cannot train 100 people where rotation is constant to enter only correct info. So there is incorrect data and we fix it in layers above ERP. It isn't always realistic to except perfect data.\n\nIn OP's case they don't have layers above their different ERP's so to fix data they would need those layers. Which is another project and it's going to cost.\n\nTo summarize: In perfect world your solution is good. Fix pricing so only some of customers have to pay $75k/month. Then fix data at the source so there isn't conflicting data or errors in data.\n\nIn this world where we have deadlines, budgets and projects need approvals we need to make quick fixes.",

I still have 4 chapters left.\n\nOne advice: don't follow the book chapter order. I found it to be extremely useful to have a chat with Gemini 2.5 Pro, tell it my whole career, give my CV, and ask it to provide me a full detailed study plan. It provided me an excellent plan which has showed to be (1) easier to follow, (2) structured to allocate more time to topics I have no hands-on experience, and (3) identify key topics/concepts to focus considering both their weight on the exam and also my experience.\n\n  \nWhat you have to keep in mind is that this exam is to level you up to management positions. It is not something that you will be able to leverage on if your aim is to have a hands-on future experience.\n\n  \nLast but not least, don't forget that there are levels that depend on how many years of experience you have and that you also have to pass two other specialized exams.",

A data platform is understood as the set of services and tools necessary for data teams to be able to develop whatever is necessary to meet business requirements. Looking at the Databricks context, Terraform can be used to standardize cluster deployments, catalog creation, permissions and access to these catalogs, among other things. In the project I'm working on, there are hundreds of clusters, it's impossible to manage, track and make the necessary changes manually. When we use Terraform, these tasks are abstracted using Git. And there is also DABs (Databricks Asset Bundle) which is based on terraform to manage the databricks assets.",

If the scale of your customer's data is not huge (< 1bn records in a data set) using your cloud object store, whether s3, azure, or gcp, with mother duck as the query engine could be an excellent, low-cost choice. Since MotherDuck rolled out support for the DuckLake lake house format (and DuckDB recently introduced white support for iceberg tables), this might fulfill your catalog needs as well. \n\n\nIf you really need a rich ontology of your data rather than a simple data catalog, you might want to check out some data virtualization options such as star dog. Ontologies come with a ton of additional complexity, and you will be more restricted in where you can store your data / what formats are supported, so I would recommend avoiding the ontology route unless it truly is a critical part of your business. \n\n\nIf you need to support very large scale, I would look for options that have a serverless pricing model available and incorporating that into your own customer billing.

SSIS can handle on‑prem migrations, but you’ll write more glue and own the failure modes. If you stick with SSIS: use the SSIS Catalog (project model), environment variables, SQL Agent with retries/alerts, CDC components, bulk-load to staging then MERGE, and a metadata-driven pattern (BIML helps). I’ve used Informatica and Talend for this; we also used DreamFactory to expose legacy DBs as REST so apps stayed decoupled during cutover. Bottom line: you’re buying guardrails and support; if your team’s strong, SSIS works.",

This is where the magic happens: you can apply labels to these pods: dag\\_id, task\\_id, and most importantly, customer\\_id. Then you just go into GCP's native billing, which can group costs by those labels, and you can see exactly how much a specific DAG for a specific customer is costing you, down to the penny\n\n  \nBut if a full migration to Kubernetes is too much, there's a \"good enough\" method. Instead of tracking dollars, track resource-hours. Airflow logs the duration of every task. If your workers are a standard instance size (e.g., n2-standard-4), you can build a simple cost model: cost = duration\\_in\\_hours \\* cost\\_per\\_hour\\_of\\_worker. It's not perfect - you'll miss network and disk I/O - but it'll get you 80% of the answer for 20% of the effort and help you find your most expensive tasks",

If your Airflow workers are not dynamic or they use the same pools of compute for all tasks, having a tagging system that trickles up into GCP/AWS billing is likely not possible. \n\nHowever you can often tag individual 'task runs' of ECS/Cloud Run instances and have those trickle into billing natively. In my experience you do lose out on additional aspects like networking out, which can be substantial, and if you can't find a way to associate that you'd need a top level overhead you append onto each task or maybe by runtime. \n\nRegarding non-efficient tasks, what does that mean? Airflows native monitoring shows the Task Duration and Landing times. Perhaps also look at sensor runtimes to subtract from overall runs as they're 'efficient'.\n\nMy opinion would be that Airflow is a task orchestrator and attempting to patch in some sort of cost observability natively would not work well. Use the systems that are native to billing are the way to go. If your environment is stupid complex per tenant, we used to have terraform project creation to deploy tenant environments and then you can provide permissions for airflow to run compute/etc in those projects. Then you can track everything at the Project level and put them under a folder to ease IAM.",

That would be a violation of Kimball's principles in this case. (Bridge tables are perfectly justified in some situations, but this isn't one of them.)\n\nSo within power query, you need to left join ProjectContribution to the source fact table, and do the multiplication to get the more granular, additive actual revenue numbers per contributor per project. You can then remove the % column (it's only semi-additive and can be calculated via a DAX measure). \n\nThat gives you your one, new, fact table, which you can then relate directly to the project dimension.

Backend is Apache 2.0, but UI/connectors use the Collate Community License (source-available with \"no competing SaaS\" restriction—can't offer it as a managed service).\n* **OpenLineage** \\+ **Marquez** \\- standardized lineage events, but you're building the metadata layer yourself. More pipeline-focused.\n\n**Orchestrator built-ins (dbt, Dagster, Airflow):** These track lineage *within their domain* but don't connect downstream to your actual reports/dashboards. You get table → table lineage but it dies at the data layer. No BI tool integration, no report ownership tracking.  \n  \n**Commercial:** Collibra, Atlan, Select Star, Monte Carlo - all have report lineage features. Expensive. Some have limited BI connectors or require their agents everywhere.  \n  \n**TL;DR:** If you want report → dataset → pipeline end-to-end lineage with ownership/KPIs attached, you need a proper catalog. DataHub if OSI-approved open source matters (procurement, contributions, full commercial freedom), OpenMetadata if the SaaS restriction doesn't affect you, commercial tools if you've got budget and specific BI tool needs.  \n  \nThe gap most orgs hit: their orchestrator shows them pipeline lineage, but nobody knows which dashboard broke when table X changed. That's the report lineage problem as you've identified.\n\nGood luck!",

The goal of the library isn’t to replace pandas, but to save people from rewriting the same pattern every time: extract the columns, modify them, and reindex. Functions like `swap_columns` or `move_after` just centralize that logic, handle bulk operations, validate inputs, and keep everything consistent so users don’t have to think about the mechanics each time.\n\nAbout `sort_columns`: yes, the pandas one-liner works perfectly. The value of having a single entry point is mostly convenience. You can switch between variance, std, mean, correlation, NaN-ratio, or a custom key without changing how you write the code. For some workflows that reduces friction; for others the built-in one-liners are already enough.\n\nAppreciate you taking the time to look at it and share your thoughts.",

        "body": "I've done this to subset data for micro-batches. It does work and you can create quite clean and comprehensive collected datasets with it, but there are caveats.\n\nFirst, if you have links between two entities of the same type (customer-customer) then you will need to recursively traverse this graph to make sure you get everything, otherwise some referential integrity or derivation can break. These links can themselves be derived links rather than explicit ones, so it isn't necessarily something you'll be able to pick out algorithmically right away. An example I had was that two customers could be linked via a shared account, but the relationship was in a generic customer-account table, and the account could appear multiple times. Pulling in a customer that wasn't initially selected could pull in *another* customer, because the third customer may be related to the second but not the first.\n\nSecond, you may end up with 'orphaned' data if you have you have some entity that is disjoint from your entry. Ideally this is not the case, but if you have multiple domains that don't directly interact you may end up just dropping an entire domain. Similar to the prior point, this is mostly something you'll find along the way, and you just need to give yourself an additional entry point.\n\nThird, you may have reference data that you don't want to filter in this way because certain outputs or reports may expect all reference data to be available regardless of whether anything relates to it. For example some classification reference set where someone does an aggregation group by that classification -- they may suddenly see classifications disappear entirely if no data was joined to it. They may prefer to still see the classification, but get `0` values in the aggregate data. Again, not something you can easily algorithmically determine, it is more of a UAT process on your data selection.\n\nThat said, this is afaik the only real feasible way to get a comprehensive random sample of the data at a given point in time. As long as you come up with an extensible and performant way to relate tables for key selection, to add extra entry points, to specify 'full copy' reference tables, and to specify 'loopbacks' on key selection, it is just a matter of configuring things.\n\nI am not aware of a 'standard practice' for this. People usually either just give up on referential integrity, or limit the time window and select everything rather than random sample.",

        "body": "I think you are right that data governance often grows out of other data domains like engineering or analytics. Companies usually learn the hard way why their engineering or analytics initiatives fail, and only then start thinking about governance. At first they try to handle it with existing people, and when it grows large enough they start hiring roles dedicated to it. In my experience this mostly happens in big regulated industries like banks, insurance companies or government. Small companies usually do not care much, and it is fine, because their scale rarely makes the problems severe, and a small team can still handle them. So yes, I would recommend looking at highly regulated areas like banking, insurance or the public sector. You will find more demand there.\n\nAs for entering data governance, it is a bit odd. From what I have seen, these roles are not the most sought after in data teams because they usually require less deep technical work. But this may only be true in organizations where the governance practice is already quite mature. Data skills still help a lot, and most places expect them in governance roles. Many organizations are still in the transition phase, where governance is mixed with regular data roles. It is still common to see a data engineer who is also a data steward at the same time while his job description might not actually indicate that.",

We have more people with the skills than customers willing to pay for those skills sadly...even though gdpr is a legal requirement. Gdpr has many facets and some are taken less serious than others and the serious ones are easy to implement with RLS and the likes. Honestly just follow the path of the others but be good at it, do your soft skills too, if you want to set yourself apart learn a software that's useful and in demand (mine is snowflake where i am the only person on the team certified, a friend of mine is the only aws person in a team of azure)",

For instance, in countries like Germany where the automobile industry is huge, companies are starting to take data governance seriously. But instead of hiring an entirely new team, they usually trust experienced internal people from engineering or analytics and hand those responsibilities over to them. Of course, they often have one dedicated person overseeing governance to guide the engineers, but that’s usually about it.\n\nWhat’s confusing, though, is that some industries seem to treat it differently. For example, Lufthansa recently started hiring specifically for data governance roles, which shows that aviation and other heavily regulated sectors are beginning to take it more seriously. So it feels like while in some industries it’s still considered a “risky zone” for newcomers, others are already investing in dedicated governance teams.",

I've seen everything, from organizations that have dedicated teams and resources for every part of it, to large organizations that have nothing in place and cannot even export data from an IT system to Excel.\n\nThat being said, very few organizations actually have it figured out. Because of that, roles inside data teams overlap a lot and people end up wearing many hats. So the recommendation to enter through any data role if you want to move toward governance is valid. It is often easier to pivot internally from analytics or engineering into governance or data management than to try to find a pure governance job from the outside.\n\nIt can also be risky. In some highly regulated organizations that are still immature, I have seen them hire data governance specialists before they even have data teams or a CDO. In those cases, the governance expert ends up sitting under legal or some other non data function. That is where it becomes ugly.",

But now it looks good but doesn't do anything, so you learn JavaScript...\n\n\n>Many people don't know how to imagine what goes into some complex multi-region live streaming platform like YouTube or Disney Plus, but what they can do is imagine what the UI looks like and what their imagined idea of it would look like. So they just start there...\n\n\nSince I'm so new, I think it might help if I do a lot of small tutorials (Github project-based learning/build your own x, big book of small python projects, or automate the boring stuff) to get exposure to what projects look like and what I'm capable of.*\n\n\nI'm currently doing things that I find fun (learning DSA and reading books like Eloquent JS), but I plan to incorporate your advice soon. \n\n\nI think it's a matter of taking one big topic, breaking it down until you can't, researching those broken down topics, then breaking it down more until you have something actionable. \n\n\nI just haven't done that for personal projects much yet, so it's easy to feel overwhelmed. \n\n\n.\n\n\n*Perhaps since I enjoy learning how things work, I can use what you said and learn how to make something like YouTube (or whatever else works) until I can recreate a crappy version myself. \n\n\nI won't be building my \"own idea\", but I'll learn the skills needed to do so (similar to what my initial idea of learning from those other materials, but framed in a different way). \n\n\nIdk, I'm just rambling. Thank you for the advice! ",

I was only able to do a semester of computer science, but I was attending a university generally quite well regarded for their computer science / cybersecurity programs. I ended up having to stop attending for financial reasons, unfortunately. \n\nAnyway, what I LOVED about their program is that it broke everything down to the fundamentals. It's been a few years so some of the following may be incorrect. This is just an example, but they had us learning C++ and started us off by learning how a computer works. Then they had us learning how a variable is basically just assigning a name to a block of memory, and storing data in that location. Or how arrays are sequentially assigned blocks of memory, so if you know where X index of an array is located in the memory, you can find the other indexes. How you can't dynamically increase the size of the array due to how C++ is reserving memory, how typing works, etc. \n\nI find that with most learning resources, they just don't even *attempt* to explain how a particular thing works beyond a basic level. But then when you try to wade into the waters of reading documentation, it's so filled with technical jargon that it's often incomprehensible to a beginner. \n\nI don't want to build legos and just slap stuff together. I don't want to know how to USE a particular programming concept, I want to actually know how it works. \n\nI recall when I was younger, attempting to build some small projects. Inevitably, I would write a bit of code that I thought understood in one project, and try to re-use the same concept in another project with a slightly different use-case, only to find that it fundamentally was not doing what I originally thought it did. When that happens now and again? Not a big deal. When that's happening pretty frequently? It becomes frustrating, and it makes me think that even when I can re-use a concept in multiple projects successfully, that I still don't totally get what it's doing. \n\nThat's the issue that I have with trying to learn by just trying to make something. I care a lot less about making any one particular project, and a lot more about knowing how everything I'm doing actually functions. \n\nAnyway, huge block of text over. If anyone has any advice for where/how to learn things in a way that is more complete than \"this is X, use it like this.\", I would love you forever. I've currently just been working my way through boot.dev's python course.",

Use an upward motion.\n3. Get in the car.\n   1. Step toward the car.\n   2. Put your right foot in.\n   3. Put your butt on the seat.\n   4. Scoot over.\n   5. Put your left foot in.\n4. Close the Door.\n   1. Put your hand on the door handle. \n   2. Pull the door shut.\n   3. Release the door handle.\n5. Start the vehicle.\n   1. Put your foot on the brake.\n   2. Put your hand in your pocket.\n   3. Close your hand around your keys.\n   4. Pull your hand back out of your pockets.\n   5. Reach out with the key in hand.\n   6. Put the key in the ignition.\n   7. Turn the Key to the Start position.\n   8. Release the key.\n\nThis is a very important skill to learn.",

It finally made sense when I came in on Monday after a weekend release and noticed an algorithm I had written (tree traversal, but that doesn't matter) had been rewritten to be less efficient by the chief architect. I was young and inexperienced and stormed in and demanded an explanation why they had \"regressed our performance\". He calmly explained the situation. To get the release out on Saturday night he had to modify the structure of the data slightly...in a way that was incompatible with my traversal. He had spent about half an hour trying to figure it out, writing unit tests to test the old and new structure...old passed, new didn't, the issue he was troubleshooting came down to the algorithm. It had no tests other than the ones he wrote. No comments explaining the reasoning behind it. It was not obvious to him why a convoluted and non standard algorithm was used. He had to fix it, and had to support it, so he did the reasonable thing and replaced it with a well known algorithm that worked with his new unit tests. Problem solved, release shipped.\n\nStarting to sympathize with the predicament he was in I explained my concern...the performance wasn't \"optimal\". \"'Optimal'? how do you know yours was 'optimal'?\" I stammered a bit and conceded I didn't actually know...but it \\*was\\* more efficient. \"Benchmarks?\" ....\"no...I never benchmarked it\". \"What cases does it work with\"....\"oh..this and that and the other....\". His response was \"how do you know?\".  \"I tested it!\" .....\"No...no you didn't. There were no tests. There are now. We know this works, when it works, and how it works.\" I responded indignantly \"but it's slower\". \"By a couple milliseconds, a few dozen times a day it runs. Do you care about that? Why? Isn't it better to know it works because it is tested with cases we expect it to handle?\"\n\n\"Yeah. If I write unit tests to fix the trivial issue with the original algorithm can I replace it?\" .... \"I guess you can....but is a few milliseconds of execution time a dozen times a day worth the effort? Don't you have actual bugs to fix?\" ....\"Yeah....\"....\"Then do it the next time you change that code\". It never had to change. I never put it back.\n\nIf I'd written unit tests showing the conditions the traversal handled, what it's preconditions were, etc he would have fixed the trivial issue with it and gone about his way, me none the wiser. Because I did a shoddy job it became his problem, and he fixed it the most expedient way possible...reasonable while the entire release team is twiddling their thumbs waiting for a critical fix.\n\nIf you don't unit test your code it doesn't really work. It \\*might\\* work. But you don't know that. You don't know what it is expected to handle. You don't know how its author was intending it to be used. I became an instant convert to unit testing after this. This happened in about 2004 before unit testing really became considered mandatory. I'm glad the industry has changed in this regard.",

Here the Odin Project also does a great job. You learn the theory and then you build a project they provide where for each project you need all the theory you were supposed to learn prior. The course is hard and takes a long time to finish but imo is far better than a 5 hour youtube tutorial. Just watching someone code or just copying a project is not the same as creating your own version of a project which you will be required to do in the Odin Project. It reads like an ad but I did use it to learn Web Development and I just legit think it's a fantastic course if you are ready to put the time and effort in.",

Like trying to learn to be a mechanic by watching YouTube but never actually touching a car. Sure, you could figure things about and fix them, in theory, but if your car actually broke down well, don't strip your nuts over tightening~ \n\nPick a project/s and just code them out. Start with the simplest thing you can code, and start making it do more and more.",

A person who lets an AI do his task for him and does not oversee the result, he also will leave such nonsense in his project. And it will be visible to recruiters. Some recruiters for sure will leave out such people.\n\n2)interview stage: when a person does not know what he is doing it will be much more apparent during the interview. He can't explain why he wrote his project the way he wrote (well, the way his AI wrote). He is unable to make changes when asked. Sometimes the interview will give him Leetcode exercise. As he did not solve his assignments on his own, he will be unable to solve these Leetcode exercises on the spot.\n\n3)probation period. First 4 months or so.

This thought is also why I ended up in a warehouse instead of being a software engineer with a great career. \nThrough coincidence I saw a comment on Reddit where someone asked what's best way to learn web development? Someone said try the Odin Project. I went on the website and really liked what I saw and decided I will start to learn how to code but this time I promised myself that if I start I won't stop no matter what. This promise to myself would become very important later as I had several moments where I wanted to give up in the beginning because I couldn't solve some Javascript puzzle.\nAt the same time I had the idea for an App that we could really use in the company I work at. For many years we used a whiteboard to do shift planing and it was really cumbersome so my goal is to develop an App for this but I had no idea how.\n7 months passed by and I was around half done with the Odin Project and decided I had enough know how to start developing the digital shift planer. If anyone is interested in the detailed development process of the App I wrote a long post in the Odin Project subreddit, you can check it out in my profile.\nAnyway after 3 months I had a working app that we now use for almost a year and as mentioned above I also won a company price for it. And after our IT guy posted it on the companies social media (it's a huge company with around 30.000 employees worldwide) I had several requests from managers around the world from countries like Taiwan, India and a couple of others for a demo. It turned out that they all are still using Whiteboards for their shift management. \nWhile this is happening I am developing an App that me and a buddy of mine plan to turn into a small company.\nAll in all I spent around 3000 hours now with programming over almost 2 years. It's never too late of course to start but I can't help but think if I had put that effort in when I was 15 I'm sure I wouldn't have ended up in a warehouse. The only thing I know is that I won't stop anymore and maybe it will lead to somewhere, maybe it won't but even if not then it will stay a lifelong hobby for me that I do in my freetime like I do now.",

I am definitely not confident that I will make it through my studies, I've literally spent days ans weeks spending tops 30-60min basically just reading. I find thinking about code really tricky, I give up easily or stop thinking. But granted, my studies are very fast paced and, I would argue, not suited to beginners. \n\nIf I want to get good I know that I have to keep coding, writing code, understanding and structuring logic consistently. I'm very impressed by people who find ways to continue working on a problem when they get stuck, or who move on to another problem, or who, perhaps even more accurately, know which questions to ask themselves to allow themselves to actually consider the problem at hand.",

Yet, they completely fail to convey the *thought process*, the *planning*, the *design considerations* that ultimately lead to the *implementation* in code.\n\nTo be fair, there are pearls who teach all that even along with debugging, but one has to find them.\n\nThe vast majority of tutorials in existence are made by people who don't fully know the subject, or who want to make some quick bucks from unsuspecting beginners. With the rise of YouTube and platforms like Udemy, etc. everybody thinks that they can be a teacher.\n\nTeaching is hard. Setting up good quality tutorials or courses is difficult and tedious. I've done that. I've authored and taught several courses. It not only requires good, in depth, knowledge of the subject but also certain communication skills as well as the ability to fall back into one's own beginner stages.\n\nIt is very difficult to find the balance between becoming too elaborate (like I did in this comment), depth of content, and handholding too much or too little.",

Videos are a great introduction, but you’ll end up getting stuck in tutorial hell from the false sense of security coding along gives you. \n\nThen it’s up to you decide what direction to go on based on personal interest.

I do not know if making Rust your first language is preferable, but the book is easy to follow and well enough written.\n\nThe first language to learn might even be JavaScript, as you can start writing it in an editor and later move on to Visual Code which is free (or a similar IDE) and see something moving and happening in your browser. Later switch to TypeScript and learn the Angular UI framework, and you will have a highly marketable skill.\n\nAnother worthwhile first language that is production ready is C#. You can use a Game Engines like Godot or Unity to learn it. Using a game engine will give you plenty of engaging ways, to visualize what you do and will keep you motivated to follow through, as you will be able to create very nice programming challenges in a game world setting.\n\nAnother highly regarded option for a first language to learn is Python.\n\nAs always, feel free to check some job sites to see how many job openings exist for a certain language or skill if you need advice about what to learn.",

Also, these courses are created individual around the world....very few brands put up their courses there.\n\n\nSimplilearn – Feels like a good balance between flexibility and structure. You get self-paced content, live expert sessions, and real-world projects, so you’re actually applying what you learn. They also have partnerships with Microsoft, IBM, and AWS, which keeps everything relevant one things which could be better is if some modules can be a bit faster, but overall, its great way to build practical skills. Also, certification from these big giants really matter when you apply for any job.\n\n\nand yeah, coursra is good too but more theoretical than hands-on. Great for building strong foundations, not necessarily for immediate job-ready skills. They have some subscriptions plans too that you can explore..\n\n\nWhich ones have you explored so far?",

Get to the point where you can make the problem happen every time. If possible. Understand the inputs and other things that cause the failure.  \n\n   There are some bugs that are intermittent. Those are the worst. You can learn about [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) someday, but not today.\n\n   If it's your thing write a test case which generates the bug.\n\n2. Try to figure out exactly which line of code caused the bug. If you get a traceback or other error message, it can tell you this. The top line of the traceback (bottom line in Python, why, Guido, why, did you do this backwards?) probably shows you the source file and line number where the problem occurred.\n\n3. Eyeball the code and the error message. Read the error message three times carefully; it often tells you exactly what is wrong in a language you don't quite understand.\n\n4. Learn to use a debugger to step through your code line by line. Start stepping (set a breakpoint) a few lines before the suspect line and do step step step. \n\n5. Try putting in a fix to the problem.\n\n6. Repeat these steps.\n\n7. If you get frustrated after doing all this, take a break. Get a good night's sleep. Sometimes the answers to my bugs have come to me in dreams. Seriously.\n\nMost importantly:\n\n**Always remember that debugging is harder than programming. Don't use all your cleverness programming something, because you'll never be able to debug it.**\n\nYou got this. Welcome to our great trade.",

Is it during compilation or runtime? What phase of compilation? Which function triggered it? Is the error message being printed to a log? Did the program crash or is it still running? — it will very likely range from a little bit tedious to extremely tedious the first couple of times you pay this much attention to an error message, but relatively quickly you’ll build a mental model of all this and you’ll be able to skim error messages quickly and come up with a full hypothesis of what’s wrong and how to fix it. You’ll start to understand things like how the tracebacks are presented in your programming language, sometimes the most relevant details are at the top, sometimes they’re at the bottom — and plenty of other useful little details\n\nUse the actual debugger for your programming environment, and get comfortable with it, ideally through some IDE/text-editor integration. Yes print line debugging is great and useful but it totally pales in comparison to a full blown debugger that lets you set breakpoints and jump through the code function by function, line by line, or breakpoint by breakpoint… Combining that with the skills/intuition that come from reading error messages will be extremely valuable for you and save you an absolutely unreasonable amount of time throughout a software career compared to not having those skills.",

If you decide it’s “Client/Server” then great, you’ve got two top-level components you can start with. Maybe it’s MVC or EDa etc. Whatever it is that choice should lead to some obvious top-level components.  Then you can start mapping them to Use Cases and decomposing them into lower-level components.  Some design principles should also guide your selection. Don’t duplicate code in multiple places. Keep implementation details abstracted. Don’t mix unrelated functionality in the same component. Etc. With a little practice it will all start falling into place naturally.",

Depending on how exactly you define this problem, those are between 1000!/900! to 1000\\^100 sequences, which is about 2\\^1000. There must be one number (seed) for every possible sequence. So that seed would have to be up to 1000 bits long, so around 125 bytes (octets). This is about 10x longer than the \"10-15 characters\" that you were hoping for, more if you were hoping for ASCII characters.\n\n\nIn general: there is no free lunch for compression. All compression techniques rely on the data having some pattern that can be described more compactly than just using the raw data.\n\n\nFurther reading:\n\n\n* Shannon entropy is a concept for describing how much information is in a piece of data. This measures how \"surprising\" the data is. Compressed data cannot be shorter than the Shannon entropy in bits. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory\n* Kolmogorov complexity describes the theoretically most compact representation of data, i.e. how long a program would be that reproduces the data. In your model, the seeds would correspond to programs that generatea sequence. The seeds cannot be shorter than the sequence's Kolmogorov complexity. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity\n* The Pigeonhole Principle is a useful technique for thinking through these kinds of problems. Here, I used this principle to notice that the size of the seed (pigeon holes) must be at least as large as the number of distinct sequences (pigeons) I want to generate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle",

This can capture a few fractional bits of savings [1] but you can't magically convert an arbitrary 100-number sequence to a single 32-bit int.\n\nTo actually compress data (losslessly), your compressed form needs to be variable-length.  Then you assign more likely inputs to shorter compressed forms.  (This only works if some inputs are less likely than others.

Those opcode, operand instructions use the instruction set of their target processor. The opcodes are literally switch settings that direct the operands to the physical hardware gates in the cpu. Your OS is not going to do any final compilation of your program. It’s going to load machine code into an isolated virtual memory space and control physical memory storage, swap space, and cpu time vs other managed processes. It will also provide mediated access to hardware via OS calls. You still have to compile for the right cpu architecture and OS. \n\nVirtual machines like the Java JRE let you start with a semi-cpu agnostic median build that is JITted into machine code at runtime. The OS still doesn’t do it. With some runtimes, like .net, you do have to specify a target cpu architecture as well. That’s a VM design choice on whether they want to abstract certain cpu features like the size of registers (32 vs 64 bit), endian storage, etc. and OS features. These choices still have to be made eventually of course and abstraction adds overhead if the actual cpu uses a different standard. Ultimately recompiling for x64, arm, and ppc is not actually a huge imposition.",

Instead of what you did, write \"System.out.println(....\" in one line. The same way how you wrote \"keyboard.next() in one line not in two lines.\n\n2. Give meaningful names to your variables. What is a? What is b?\n\n3. Read about methods. Your main method is too long. You can take out the quitting part and separate mathematical operation parts into separate methods and then use these in your main method.\n\n4. Move the definition of your variables after the quitting block. Because there is no point to define these variables when you never set a value to them with your quitting. Here it has no effect but in larger programs defining variables you don't use wastes system memory. Also, in your case there is no need to define a variable and set a value to it, separately. You can do just \"double a = keyboard.nextDouble();\" And the same goes for other variables as well.\n\n5. Don't add comments unless necessary. Your code should be self-descriptive. I suggest to read about Clean Code standards. Add comments when the code itself can't explain the existence of itself: why the code is there, why it does what it does, etc.",

The second part is sometimes not something that you can see.\n\nGuys I work with heavily rely on AI. Here is what I have noticed since I have to review their code. They understand the code it generates. But they don't understand or aren't aware of the problems the AI is trying to solve. So when it implements a solution,  it looks correct, it technically does what it said it does, but it's often not actually correct...even when it looks like the code is working. \n\n- AI will happily reinvent the wheel. Not only that,  it will reinvent a slightly incorrect wheel and each wheel will be slightly different, even though it's supposed to be the same wheel. \n\n- The best way to have no bugs in your application is to delete all your code. AI will happily delete your code. We did a review where a guy was having problems with authentication. He just kept feeding the errors into AI. What did AI do? It deleted the entire Authentication system in the front-end and hardcodwd an API key in it's place. Problem solved 😂😂😂. \n\n- I am constantly finding race conditions in the code these guys submit. Why? Because they aren't aware of the implications of the code they are submitting.\n\nNow I work with another guy who does know what he's doing. He has AI write a lot of the code. But he is constantly correcting AI. Telling it that what it produced is garbage. He can make AI iterate to a correct solution a lot of the time. Other times, it's just quicker to write it yourself because the AI just doesn't get.\n\nWhen I was learning, I recognized that I didn't know what I didn't know. Knowing thst this class problems even exists in the first place is 99% of the battle. What separates experienced developers from junior developers is knowledge of what types of problems exist. \n\n\n\nNow as far as learning, I relied a lot on YouTube tutorials, books, Google, stackoverflow etc to learn concepts and how to make something.  In my case, there was a project that flipped the switch for me. I went from not knowing how to do anything other than stupid little college programs to \"holy shit...it makes sense now\". That was a project that I actually made for a group and they actually used it. And in using it, they ran into all kinds of problems. Encountering those problems and thinking about why they are occurring and then solving them...that's what really started my learning. Most of my solutions came to me during long showers 😂😂😂.  Once you start to understand those problems, you start to realize that there's even problems. And that opens up a whole new world. You can get out of Tutorial hell and know what actually research.",

If you are totally new to programming, what I have been doing is first identifying what I want to gain from said language, (for me it was Golang, I want to build software, develop \"engineers\" mindset, and get hired). \n\nThe one thing I have learned overall about programming, is that fundamentally it is the skill of problem solving. I have used python before and when I solve problems, I don't even see the language anymore, I see the problem. I have 3-4 different resources I am using for go specifically. Learn go with tests, learn go the hard way, and Exercism. Each resource fills in gaps for the other. Exercism helps you develop the problem solving skill that is fundamental to programming, Learn go the hard way is a total beginners book on programming with go. Learn go with tests is a more intermediate book I go through after I finish the same topic in both exercism and LGtHW. Its allowed me to immerse myself and not just \"learn go\", but develop the problem solving and engineers mindset. \n\nAll this to say, find what works for you. If it is a text based courses and books, then great, if it is a video course, then great, if it is building something, then great.

I'm only ever going to get out what I put in. Ah. There it is. Put. And null. I'm putting a null value in as a placeholder and then I'm trying to use it as a real non null value.

The value of your `List<Integer>` is null. This causes the null pointer exception. \n\nThe best way to avoid potential null errors popping up is to never use null.

You don't need C++ to make a paint program.\n\nLet me break it down for you:\n\n- Pick a programming language.\n- Figure out how to make interactive programs and draw your own graphics (canvas in JS, Pygame in Python).\n- Figure out how to draw a pixel on the screen.\n- Figure out how to get the position of the mouse, and whether a mouse button is pressed.\n- Draw a pixel under the mouse when the mouse button is pressed.\n\nYou now have a very simple drawing program.\n\nYou can add UI elements for changing colors, clearing the canvas, drawing lines instead of pixels, different brush patterns, etc.\n\nSaving and loading may be a bit...complicated.  You will probably end up using a library to convert pixels into a PNG file.  If you struggle, you can always come back here with a more specific question (\"I'm writing a drawing program as a webpage in JavaScript.  The user puts pixels on a canvas with the mouse.  How do I convert those pixels on the canvas to a PNG file for the user to download?\").\n\nIt's up to you how far you go into the details of graphics drawing.  For example, whether you use the line-drawing function provided by your graphics library, or you [convert a line to pixels yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm).\n\nC++ can be helpful if you want high-resolution, high-performance drawing code for fancy effects, or you want to interface with existing C++ libraries.  But you don't need it to make a simple drawing program for learning purposes.",

You start by copying mostof it ir modifying what's already there. With time you become more proficient and build up a mental repertoire of patterns that are frequently used. With time you will come to the point at which you will be given a task and immediately think of patterns you've used previously. when given a task you break it down into smaller problems like copying files, sending data over a serial connection, receiving, logging to a file or plotting data. You don't have to reinvent the wheel. most of these singular tasks are solved in a similar way most of the time and you only have to tweak or modify according to the current circumstances of the project.

Simpler. \n\nPretty much every new project I write starts off with \"Hello World\". Then I *slowly* extend its features outward, checking the behavior every step of the way. Read the error messages in full! Something isn’t working right? Check the documentation.\n\nUse git to give yourself a safety net for when you go too fast. Can’t figure out how to get the program running without an error? Throw away the changes (it’s like rock climbing; the commits are your anchors). Don’t be afraid to throw away changes. You write them once; you can write them again (and probably a lot better the 2nd time)",

That way you get the full picture.\n\nIf you want to focus on one part of the stack, pick one and go.\n\nThe trouble I have seen with that is you are only getting part of the picture. For example, a backend engineer will work with the server and the database too. However, at the beginning they really do not know what the requirements are to interact with another engineer that is working on the frontend.\n\nSame for the frontend, they don't really know what to send to the server, how to send it, and what to do with it when they get it if then don't have someone on the backend to interact with.\n\nYou are learning on your own so you will be missing one of the sides if you don't do both.\n\nJust some thoughts about it.

Does something need adjustment?\n* And every time you implement a box, try to think of the caller as something that can never now about the innerworkings of the box. This forces you to have clearly defined borders.\n* Now repeat this all the way down.

You can use the epsilon-delta definition of a limit to prove a ton of stuff in Real Analysis. But you can revisit those same problems later using the lens of topology, and make some of it easier and some of it harder.\n\nAdditionally, functional programming typically comes with some very strong guarantees on mutability and which operations are dependent on each other, stronger than can be made in *arbitrary* non-FP contexts. This enables a different class of compiler optimizations. But of course, immutability has many of its own performance downfalls, so it’s incredibly application specific.\n\nTL;DR: functional programming is useful because it’s another tool in your toolbelt for solving very hard problems.",

Write a method that uses them.\n\nIn the end, you will have nice extensive project to portfolio with all stuff you learned.",

Then you need to determine what should happen for each key - no matter what you decide, it is probably going to be rules that only you know, so you have to find some way of telling the program what the rules are. But begin by writing them out on paper for yourself. e.g. \"A\" should add 1 each time, \"S\" should add 10, \"D\" should subtract 1, and so on.\n3. Begin by writing a program that only understands two of the rules, like \"A\" and \"S\" or whatever makes sense to you. Probably something like a set of if-statements.\n4. When you have that basic program working, it is time to expand with all the rules - but writing 102 if-statements are going to be annoying! Hopefully you can see some sort of pattern, like if key 'x' is pressed, add value 'n' to the number ...\n5. Maybe you can use a data structure like a `dict` in Python to pair up the key 'x' and value 'n' values, and then find the pressed key in that `dict`, and add the matching number. This will take a bit of research into dicts, but it will be time well spent!",

Setting out to build a huge system, which is what you have envisioned, is likely to result in feeling like its too big and burnout. I would encourage you to pick one small component of what you want to build and do that. Skip the fancy UI, make it a command line utility so you don't get bogged down with building a fancy interface. Stay very focussed on it and only it. Don't worry if it feels like you can't visualize it, you can add that later once the core is working. For example, \"signal processing\" is very general. What inputs do you want to process to produce what outputs? Pick one, say the ability to accept stereo audio and determine which side of the space it is on. Not where it is, just which side, ie left or right. Test it, first with unit tests, then using live data. Get it working, very well. Feeding unreliable data to the next step in the processing pipeline will create pain as you have to determine which component is unreliable. Then add multiple sources of input, ie two people having a conversation back and forth. Extend it to identify that there isn't a single source. Get that working. Then extend again to identify which side the sources are on. Get it working. Unit test everything so you don't accidentally break stuff that you had working. I could go on and on and on...but that is how you build a complex system from the ground up.\n\nExpect your project to take years working on it full time. What you have laid out is a \\*massive\\* undertaking. Spend ample time evaluating existing libraries and tools that do the things you want...it's almost always easier and faster to use existing components than to build your own. Beware of the licenses...don't use anything that you don't want to be restricted by in the future. You can always replace components with others or your own if you determine they don't work. That might be reasonable to get you past a hurdle, but can also be a waste of time if you try to use something and it just isn't suited. Rack it up as a learning experience and move on.\n\nBreak everything down into manageable chunks. Days or maybe a week...longer than that does not provide enough structure or confidence in feasibility. Don't know how to do something in order to know how long it will take? Break it down into chunks that you can research until you know enough to have a good idea of what is involved and how long it will take.\n\nDid I mention breaking things down into manageable chunks? This project planning can be difficult because it's more fun to dive in. It is a necessity...don't skip it. It will be more gratifying to get a small task done rather than have a big undefined task that slogs on and on.",

Sports fans generally aren't trying out for the team, especially at 30\n\nWhat's driving the need to write code?  It's not fun to force it, I see this in students all the time.  It's hundreds of hours of tedious labor.  Are you sure this is the thing you want to spend all your free time on for years?\n\nNot trying to discourage but I wonder if this need couldn't be sorted out more easily?

You'll come to regret it.\n\nFirst of all - you'll spend all your time finding the perfect translation, but often the words themselves don't actually mean in programming, what they mean in English. Just something as basic as \"print\" - it never means \"print\", it always means \"write this sequence of characters to the standard output stream, be it a file, or terminal-window\". Which is probably why different languages (and APIs) calls it write, print, log, out, or >> ... So what should your translation be? And if you choose the Spanish word for \"write\" as the function name for \"print\", then what'll you do when you suddenly come across another function called \"write\"? Should that be called the same, or something different?\n\nAnd even if you succesfully translate all the functions, classes and methods, you still can't translate words like if, while, for, function, class, return and so on - you you'll still end up with a mix.\n\nAnd the worst part is - when you forget what a translation means, and come across some of your earlier code - you'll have no way of understanding what it actually does, if the Spanish-named functions are part of the program itself, or translations of the system-functions. And you won't be able to search for anything, because no one else knows your exact translation files ...\n\nBut you are not the first thinking these thoughts, and in fact there has been a number of localized programming languages around the world.

The code editor isn’t just an empty text box, but it also doesn’t auto fill everything for you. The XP system is nice, it really makes you feel bad for using a hint / the assistant. And when you do use him for help, he never gives you the answer directly, he helps you through it. Overall I recommend it. :)",

You can organize into projects, epics, stories, tasks, subtasks, with priorities and current status, assignments, and related issues (blockers, etc.). There are comments, descriptions, attachments, and workflows, backlogs, and sprints (or kanban). It is pretty easy to create simple tasks and you can go as deep into it as you want. This would be great process learning as this is the way companies typically work.\n\nI hope this helps. Ask more questions if you have them. You all are doing a really great job learning.",

Like do you really need a timeline and assignments, etc, when you can just talk face to face in class.\n\nAnd my suggestion, as an alternate, or cooperative, because it's what I'm learning, is to try out Test Driven Development (TDD).  Or BDD or whatever who calls it.\n\nTDD is kinda tricky until you get used to it, but fundamentally, it's just your list of notion tasks, written as code, as part of your codebase.  You just have to change your point of view from \"is this task complete?\" to \"is this task fail-pass?\"  It's an automated checklist.  It's an awesome feeling to run my tests and have a lot of ✅✅✅✅✅ show up.\n\n\nI'm not saying to follow TDD strictly to the letter.  I'm saying to add a bit of testing.  Even now, when you write your code, you need to know if it's working or not.  Automate your manual checks is what I'm saying.",

        "body": "> How to figure things out on my own?\n\nKind of ironic that you're even asking this, rather than figuring it out on your own, no?\n\nThe process is pretty straight forward - you think about it. You read about it. YOU BEGIN BY STUMBLING AROUND, LOST AND ALONE IN THE DARK until you trip over something that might possibly happen to lead you somewhere. You have no idea what you're doing or where you're going until you get there, only to discover it was a dead end, and then you have to backpedal and try to figure out where else you might be able to go - perhaps from a past breadcrumb, perhaps a different trailhead you found along the way that you can come back to.\n\nFiguring shit out on your own means being lost most of the time. If you are willing to accept that whatever you're trying to do - you're likely not the first, and your problem was probably already solved first 60-80 years ago, then there's a lot of academic research to do. It's reading, reading, reading...\n\nIf what you're doing IS unique, well then you have to spend a lot of time just thinking, just trying stuff. Every failure informs you of what not to do and how not to do it. You have to know what you want to accomplish in the first place so you can measure how far off you are.\n\n> I want to know how I can truly figure things out on my own and study effectively without missing important or essential information\n\nYou need to embrace that you're totally missing shit, all the time. There is a depth of knowledge in front of you that you have no idea is even there, but the more you learn of it, the more profound all future insights would be, the faster and better you will find future solutions.\n\nBut don't miss the forest for the trees. I've been programming for over 30 years - I'm tickled that Unicode is backward compatible with 1830s telegraph equipment, and that means something to me, but it doesn't mean anything to you. You're not there and it doesn't have to matter.\n\n> while also avoiding wasting too much time\n\nThis bad attitude is not going to serve you. NOTHING is a waste of your time. Thomas Edison didn't invent the lightbulb, but he did improve upon it. He said it himself - he didn't fail 10,000 times, he just found 10,000 ways how not to do it. That information was GOLD back then. You don't learn from successes but failures. Being lost and stumbling, \"wasting time\" as you put it is a very necessary part of the process, it builds your intuition, which is what you actually need - knowledge you don't know you have and don't have to think about, but it informs you. You may not yet be on the path you want, but you're learning all sorts of other things, and it always comes back around to aid you.",

True, not all the knowledge gets put into projects but projects are still a way to see where you are in your journey.\n\nLet's say you can build an A. But you can't build a B yet. Which sets you a milestone. It can be a milestone in a linear line (simple HTML page -> static webpage -> dynamic webpage -> a web service -> etc.) but can be also on all kinds of directions (a home automation system, an MMO game, a Java applet for a smartcard, etc). \n\nFor example I feel comfortable with Java. I use it in my daily work. I can build web services that consist of separate microservices/monoliths and communicate with each other via Kafka or via some MQ tool. That is my position on backend web application development line. Yet when I add frontend side to it, then I have to take many steps back because I do not feel comfortable with stuff like React or Angular. I can get my tasks done but it is out of my comfort zone. I am yet to reach a point where I do not mind a Jira task that tells me to work on our frontend side. Or, a totally different direction: I'm still quite a beginner when it comes to creating mobile apps. I can get something done on a hobby project level. But I can't work as a mobile app developer. And programming a remote control? I can't do it. Probably can figure something out by reading documentation and using trial and error approach, but it is totally out of my specialty. And implementing a post-quantum cryptography algorithms? No idea at all.\n\nI use different stages/levels of projects to measure my knowledge and skills. What is easy for me, what I am fine with doing, what I can teach others, where I'm struggling, and what I can't reasonably do.",

The wages dropped along with the number of positions.\n\n\nBefore that it was Cloud computing. Wedge the word cloud into your startup to increase the chances of getting funding. Cloud experts were in great demand. Ultimately cloud has become pretty ubiquitous and now just a part of dev. Mostly it's just the cloud providers who have made big money from it.\n\n\nI think AI will be the next Cloud, rather than the next Blockchain. Lots of companies looking for an excuse to use it, most not making any money from it. Lots of AI startups going nowhere. The infrastructure required to train models will limit the AI providers to the larger companies with each trying to gain market share. AI is a financial bubble, but a useful tool also.

And a two year gap is an issue, but it’s something you can overcome (you can also finesse it on delivery).\n\n1. Go all out on applying right now to see if you can get an offer within the calendar year. It’s unlikely, given how close we are to the end, but those kinds of arbitrary markers matter on a resume.\n2. Target what’s sinking you. It sounds like you have to some extent, but in a more nebulous way. Do practice interviews with other people online. There’s literally nothing more important than that, and getting feedback.\n\nAlso, I second what everyone else said about vitamin deficiencies, chemical imbalances, etc. Sometimes it's just something medical in our bodies that needs tending to.",

Had to move back in with my parents, it all made me miserable. \n\nFinally decided if I wanted to do something worthwhile, I would need a degree. Turns out if you haven't been in school for awhile, its hard to get accepted to a technical program, so did community college for a year, got into a program, didn't really know what I wanted to do, did math, decided CS might be reasonable. Transferred to a different (better engineering school), COVID hit, decided the work I was doing in CS was remarkably boring, did really poorly, felt wayward again. Got transfered to a different program (Civil Engineering), got through the whole program pretty quickly and cleanly, basically could care less about it. Now I am in a Computing  applied AI and systems masters program trying to focus on the components I actually enjoy (to varying degrees of success so far). The joy I find in all of this comes in at the edges, and honestly my girlfriend and cooking, the little things I do everyday keep me sane.\n\nI say all of this to say its okay to be struggling, its fine to vent and shout into the void, its fine to be tired and disappointed and honestly, in my experience is its also normal to feel like you are doing everything right and still come up feeling like you didn't get anywhere. Life is a grind, survival is a grind and if you can set goals and work towards them, that is awesome (and aspirational), but when something doesn't work out, for whatever reason, it doesn't mean you are washed, you aren't done, just time to figure out the next thing.",

The finance industry operates exactly at the peak of its own hype cycle, *they* decide when the party is over and the money will stop flowing, and are always certain to secure their own bag before anyone else. \n\nYour continued career success is based on the opinion of some Warren Buffett-looking dude who spends most of his days working from his vacation home or in Stamford, CT, contrary to the delusions of some people on this sub, who think that SWEs are sacrosanct. This profession isn't, and never was, immune from macroeconomic realities and hype cycles. Software might be integral to the modern world, but that doesn't mean that the people making the decisions think that *you* are. That is a big lesson that lots of people on this sub still need to learn, because there is still loads of copium on this sub.",

Might get a handful of people trying to weasel through on a VPN, but it would at least create a barrier, and I’m sure the HR folks that review the resumes and stuff would appreciate not having to sift through 90 resumes of ineligible applicants just to find the handful of eligible ones interspersed throughout.",

Had a final meeting with my boss the day before my last day, and he told me they were told it was for two reasons:\n\n1) Rising interest rates were cutting into the bottom line and they were concerned about runway (they had at least several years at the burn rate at the time).\n\n2) They lost their CTO, VP, and Director for the engineering side of things, and the rest of the executive board didn't want to handle a team of 16 engineers directly, so to make things easier they decided cutting the team in half made sense.\n\nIn the few months after the layoff, half of the remaining engineers left for other opportunities, taking the org down to just 4 engineers. Apparently this led to some panic with the execs, and they finally did what I and others wondered why they didn't just do in the first place: they promoted they very capable and well liked lead engineer to VP, giving them their delegation point.\n\nOne of the staff engineers who remained (who I worked with at my job before that one) said they were considering seeing if folks who were laid off might be interested in returning, and flat out asked me, \"If we offered to bring you back, would you?\" Told him I'd really have to think about it, but given the reasons for why the layoff happened I would have a hard time being willing to trust the company wouldn't do it again. He understood and that was the end of that conversation. Sucked too because if I would have been able to just slide back into my job there, as it was before, it would have been a $20k pay bump compared to the job I'd started a few weeks before that conversation took place.\n\nLayoffs lead to further attrition, and it's usually the most capable folks in the org who have avenues they can explore to leave. My manager, for example, gave notice a week after the layoff to go be the founding engineer of another company a buddy of his had started, and had been bugging him to join.\n\nThe entire reason I was at that job was the place I worked before laid off 20% of the company in early 2022, and the attrition afterwards was big. I survived that layoff, the first one I ever survived, but it sucked watching folks I absolutely enjoyed working with leave. Many of them ended up at one or two other companies, and I ended up at one of those companies when one of them suggested they reach out for me to expand engineering. Frustrated with the promotion process and not liking the new landscape of things, being able to interview for two hours (system design and leadership rounds to assess level, no coding) for a $25k pay bump was too tempting.\n\nThere are mental aspects to these things that linger, for everyone regardless of whether they were the ones let go or if they got to stay. I'm not saying layoffs should never happen or are never necessary, but for all the ones I've been through they definitely felt too reactionary and didn't consider the aftershock among those who remained.",

It’s kind of awkward after college to be like ‘You seem chill, wanna kick it sometime?’. It’s way easier to be like ‘I heard you were interested in doing X, I’ve been wanting to check it out’ and then it opens the door to invite them to do something together.

It wasn't a competitive thing, it was more like \"goddamn how did you do all of that?\".\n\nAnd IMO usually the Seniors have these traits:\n* mentioned above, they're always exceeding expectations\n* they can take ambiguity and figure it out and get it done\n* instead of asking to do something, they just do it\n* the don't have to be asked to mentor someone\n\nthat last bullet has a bit of a blurry line, some companies will make it a point for a Senior to be assigned to someone for mentorship. That being said, people are gonna come to you for guidance, you shouldn't deny that because you're not officially their mentor",

You still have to go in and iterate with it or adjust things by hand.\n\n2. Use cursor. Cursor has, for me, performed a lot better. Its ability to search through the codebase for context and examples is very helpful.\n\n3. Give it context. Point it in the direction of a similar test suite with patterns you want it to emulate. If you just tell it to write tests for Service X, it will do whatever it wants - which is usually not what you want. Point out patterns you want it to emulate (e.g., “Use fluent assertions and create separate expectation objects to compare results against”)\n\n4. Don’t trust the tests it creates. Testing is meant to find the cracks and AI is an agreeable little sycophant. It’s just trying to get tests to pass. So there’s a balance you need to find where you come up with how to test and the AI just writes it. Otherwise you’re in danger of coming up with tests that are meaningless but pass and create false coverage.",

My prompts for larger changes are usually about 2 or 3 good paragraphs.\n\nThere's 2 approaches to this:\n\n* learn how to provide all the necessary requirements and context so that an agent can do everything all at once\n* break up your work into small bite sized pieces and have the agent work on those one by one. AI is generally really good at small tasks so stringing them together can often prove to be pretty good.",

I modified a single line to return a reference instead of a copied value and it worked.\n\noddly enough, I do not find copilot, cursor, codex, claude, opencode or any other tool \"better\" than using AI like this. to me this is the best way to use it, to get 1 little kernel of \"knowledge\" if it can uncover it and then discard everything and make the change myself. i find all I want from AI is \"what am I missing in my understanding\" not \"give me the solution with me having zero understanding\"",

When I was at Compass we went from 150 to 440 engineers in a year and I sat through probably hundreds of technical screens. The correlation between leetcode performance and actual job success is... not great.\n\nWhat I've seen work better is giving them a real problem from your actual workflow. Like pull up some messy production data and ask them to write a query to find something specific. Then watch how they think through edge cases, ask clarifying questions, handle nulls and duplicates. For Python, give them a small script you actually use - maybe something that parses logs or transforms data between formats. See if they can extend it or fix a bug you introduce. The best candidates will ask about the business context, not just dive into coding.\n\nAlso consider splitting the time - 15 minutes on a practical coding exercise, then 15 minutes discussing their approach to debugging, testing, code reviews. Ask about a time their code broke in production and how they handled it. Or show them a piece of your actual codebase and see if they can understand what it does. These conversations tell you way more about whether they'll succeed than watching them reverse a linked list. I've hired people who bombed leetcode but were incredible at understanding business problems and writing maintainable code that other humans could actually work with.",

It's usually pretty obvious within a minute or two if the person actually has the level of python expeirence they claim (again you'd be surprised at how many people say they have several years of experience as a senior python engineer then it takes them 5 minutes to remember how to define a function or whatever) and then you can spend the rest of the time gauging their communication skills etc.\n\nWe actually measure internally what % of candidates pass the initial 30 min tech screen and then fail later rounds of tech screens and have experimented with lots of questions, the fizzbuzz-style one had the best outcomes.",

For example, when you know people underestimate, why aren't you calling them out then and there? I don't mean it in a accusatory way, I mean are you aware of where the discrepancy is coming from, e.g. \"code complete\" vs \"rolled out 100%\", does it account for KTLO/distractions, high intensity work (focused dev) vs low intensity work (babysitting some request to another team), are there unspoken social pressure dynamics, etc. And have you articulated the impact of these heuristics on your team's estimation skills? I've literally had to tell people \"don't tell me the number you think I want to hear\", for example, when I smelled a \"going through the motions\" estimate.\n\nOn the code quality front, \"letting them failing\" is another way of saying to give people autonomy to potentially shoot their own foot (and then own up to it). Rather than taking over the driving seat, you can ask questions like \"what have you tried\" or \"have you considered X\" to put the bulk of investigation work back on their court and indicate that they own the outcome of that task.",

EM does a lot more in the realm of fielding requests for work coming from other teams. Understands our capabilities, commits us to work that is in our ballpark\n\nand so our tasks to start are usually very broad in definition, something like \"Add Drawer Login Component\" with really just the design files attached and some bigger acceptance criteria\n\nit's on us to break that down to the smaller manageable tasks, and point them as a group. Then they're just added to the queue for the sprint, that's what we've committed to. All unassigned.\n\nand so now, anyone can pick up any of those tasks, let's say given an assumption we all have similar skillsets. Maybe a junior picks up a task that is a little more difficult; they can either take on the challenge, or maybe a more mid or senior stops them and says - \"oh hey this might be a little more involved, but you can help me build this part of it\" and create another ticket.\n\nSo now we're all trusted to get the job done by doing all the discovery and now we have to work a little bit more together, and everyone has an idea of who's taking what. Junior A is prob waiting on bigger design things from Senior B before they can start. The senior would be inclined to prep the junior on what they have to do. or get them to focus on something else while Senior B finishes.\n\nYou, just kinda make sure that you're aware of the progress, and the more senior engineers are there to identify risks. And you need this teamwork to happen, in order for you to be able to focus on the more important things\n\nEngineers handle their own PR reviews, since they've been working more closely together they already have context of the changes, they've prob already done an initial once over, and things move a long quicker.\n\nanyway i think you get it but keep in mind this is the IDEAL state of things.

I’m not their manager, but I’m one of only a handful of people whose approval is required on basically every PR.\n\nSo I’ve got my popcorn out and am watching what comes of all of this. Obviously to take this approach you have to be confident of your continued employment (which I am) and have the higher ups on board with your approach. This might be different for you since you said you were also their manager, I specifically turned that job down a few months ago because I want nothing to do with being anything more than the team/tech lead.",

        "body": "60 hours a week is a solid chunk of time to become good at anything, which equates to about 3120 hours yearly.\n\nNow here's the kicker, you either like your job or you don't.\n\nIf you do, then you need to apply 20 extra hours to working more (if you're salary, if not then up to you),\n\nor if you don't like your job then apply that 20 extra hours on another subject.\n\n  \nIf you choose not to apply that time to your job then you're looking at roughly 1000 hours a year, which is what you need to \"master\" or \"grab the hammer\" I call it.  Some guys spend 20 years in C++ optimization and still find new things out today, so they are \"masters\" or \"able to drive nails in one hit\".  That's truly how I look at it, can you walk into an environment and within 10 minutes narrow down a root cause.  If you can't find something that quick then you haven't spent at least 1000 hours studying.\n\nIf you choose to apply those skills to your job then you also need to make sure you aren't a slave to it, then people can control you and make your life a living hell.  If anyone questions why you're there so late/early, or you login for a lot of time, then you can gently slip in that it's part of your \"professional education\".  Literally use those words.\n\nIf you're Indian or Asian (in those countries) then I would be careful with what you give your boss, they could become abusive.  If it's an American employer then feel free to work for free.  Why? because you're not working for free, you're making yourself look better (job security) and you're progressing your skillset.\n\n  \nThe Key:\n\nDo not think that your devotion to the company will result in that job security or professional progression.  You're using them for education while paying your bills.  Companies will chew you up and spit you out so be careful with how you practice things at work.\n\n  \nThe Middleground:\n\nStudy outside of your job things that will make you useful then either grab tickets you know you can do, or communicate that you want to try this because you've been working on it alone.  Why not just self-study and keep it private? Well a homelab isn't going to teach you how to upgrade pods and update images in a production environment, you can mock something like it, but when your boss is breathing down your neck and crap is running down your leg then you'll be glad you worked in a real env.\n\n  \nThe Takeaway:\n\nTake advantage of having a job and a place where you can see things break live, that's where the money is made, not when everything is running well.\n\nIf you are truly just a curious individual then forget everything I said and protect 20 hours a week to explore whatever you want.  Having a job means you can buy GPUs, electronics, hardware, etc. maybe not the best but something for you to work with.  No one skill will make you permanently secured in your job, no one job will make you automatically rehireable, but constantly learning new things and \"getting a hold of the hammer\", will keep you happily employed.\n\n  \nMe? well I'm unemployed because well...I don't know really...actually I suck at Leetcode and haven't used NodeJs a lot.  However, if you have a job then you're in good standing.",

If you’re struggling, let your manager/senior know rather than failing silently. There is nothing wrong with struggling. But there is something wrong if you cry in quiet and put your team and deliverables into risk. If you let them know, they can also communicate with whoever is necessary and take action earlier. This way, if you deliver stuff, perfect move on to the next thing. If you struggle and let them know, you will get the help you needed and everyone will still be happy because they know they can trust you.\n\nAnd second part is learn to be independent and you need to carry some of the burden the team have. Your existence should not be a burden for someone else but rather help them to carry it. Few examples of this could be, actively review pull requests. Don’t wait someone else to tell you to fix something if you see a problem. Write documentation if you know something. This is kinda related to company size but if you are working with different teams from different departments and they need help, be the guy who they get that needed help from.",

Azure is _more_ than thriving.\n\nSecond, look at the company in question’s health. Specifically, review their recent stock price history (if they are a publicly traded company), see if they are operating at a net loss, and read reviews from employees to see if there are any negative trends to watch out for if you were to join. (For example, if one employee review says that everyone backstabs each other, but the other 300 show nothing but praise, the backstabbing claim was most likely made from a bitter person who got fired, or at least it is very uncommon at that company. However, if more than half of the reviews indicate serious backstabbing problems, then yeah, that’s a major red flag.)",

        "body": "This is kind of a brain dump, but hopefully it helps:\n\nThere are four types of layoffs (at least):\n\n1. The company is doing bad and they need to cut costs to stay afloat\n\n2. Corporate greed - the company is doing perfectly fine but the shareholders aren't seeing enough profit so we're gonna lay a bunch of people off to get more \"efficient\", which actually means \"overwork the shit out of people\"\n\n3. Bloat - the company is doing fine, but there's a bunch of people that aren't actually working on projects that are valuable and the company can realistically not justify keeping them around\n\n4. A team is no longer necessary because the product/service/whatever they support is getting axed because it sucks - the rest of the company is fine\n\nAnd that is the order of how unappetizing it should be to join that company. A company that is struggling so much that it needs to lay people off is not necessarily a company that will turn it around because of the layoffs - things might get even worse after the layoffs.\n\nA company that is laying people off because of greed is going to have a horrendous work culture where people are going to have to work long hours, where a lot of knowledge will have recently left the company, etc. So you're not necessarily at risk of getting laid off, but you're going to be dealing with a pretty shitty work environment for a while.\n\nA company that allows bloat to happen now might allow bloat to happen again - if they aren't disciplined in their hiring, it means there's a risk that you might be the next bloat they get rid of. So this is going to be a role in which you're going to want to quickly make sure you're attaching yourself to valuable projects.\n\nAnd lastly - sometimes shit doesn't work out. We're seeing this with Amazon for example - you signed up to work on Alexa and now Alexa looks like it's going nowhere. It sucks, but sometimes you do need to get rid of like an entire department because it's just not what the company can justify. And as long as you're not joining a highly experimental arm of the company, this shouldn't really impact you much.\n\nI think by now there are very few companies that haven't done layoffs, and a company that is conservative enough to never overhire will have their own issues - namely, probably some stagnation and some lagging the market. Not always, but often.",

Stability of position may \"feel\" stronger and your psyche will appreciate it. The people will appear more at ease and will usually be more pleasant to work with.\n\nManagement will probably have a better vision and plan to steer the company. With a company doing layoffs expect lots of changes in direction and reorgs.\n\nSo basically, your thought exercise while not totally impossible is hinging on two assumptions: the company was hurting before and the layoffs are improving their standing, and that these companies would be even interested in hiring in the first place. If you were even able to get an opening at these companies, would you even want to work there? Maybe, but unlike a share of a company you purchase you have to live that work every day and suffer from the environment for your livelihood's sake:\n\nSource: survived several major layoffs at medium co for the last several years.",

        "body": "Hey, I’ve been through similar experiences and have a few opinions to share.\n\n1. You’ll improve code quality on the job. The alternative is to look at more code (open source) but I don’t recommend that unless you’re really passionate about it. Otherwise, it might add more stress. So, just try to criticize and improve your code base at work. Practice articulating what looks good and what looks bad, and why. Experiment with new ideas and you’ll learn faster. There are many signals to look out for in a codebase: does any part of your dev flow slow you down when building new features, are any parts confusing if a new dev were to work on it, do you have to update multiple places in code for a simple feature, etc. If you have few complaints then maybe your structure is solid after all. If you do identify issues, chances are that it’s something someone else ran into and found a solution for, so it’s always worth searching for how others approach things.\n\n2. The only way is to study and to practice. There are tons of online resources. One that I’ve used is GreatFrontEnd, but try googling or searching this sub to find some structured learning resources. Also, ChatGPT is a great tool to ask dumb questions and get good feedback. Chat is also a great tool to ask your exact question : “how do I rebuild my fundamentals in a structured way.”\n\n3. Similar answer: study and practice, using online resources. I’ll bet you know a lot more than you give yourself credit for, but maybe don’t have the language to articulate ideas. Again, you can treat AI tools as a dev buddy: before developing a feature, create your rough design idea and ask Chat for feedback. (Typically this would be done with colleagues, but if you don’t have other devs as resources, AI is a solid tool imo.)\n\n4. I recommend stopping your weed consumption until you feel less anxious about your career. If you can’t cut it out completely, I recommend reserving it for a specific time and in smaller doses, like at night after all responsibilities are done for the day and you’re ready to wind down for bed. This is a nice middle ground because quitting cold turkey can lead to relapse and a negative spiral. Reserving it for night time only is a guilt-free window for you. This way, you’re using weed as a reward rather than a coping mechanism. Just make sure you have a solid and consistent waking schedule. :)\n\n5. This is more life advice than just career advice: we’re human beings with finite time in this life. You’ll never have time for everything so a good skill to learn is time management. With this career revamp you’re working on, write out everything that’s on your mind, and then choose the ones of highest importance (it’s subjective and only you can decide that). For each item that you’ve prioritized and deemed important enough to focus on, break it down into smaller chunks. Rinse and repeat until you have less overwhelming and more actionable tasks. And most importantly, do the tasks! If they’re small enough to complete, it helps you psychologically build momentum. If tasks seem daunting it’s usually because they feel more ambiguous and that’s when our minds resort to coping strategies (like smoking weed or scrolling on your phone). In these cases it’s okay to dive in and try things out until it feels less ambiguous, and from there you can continue the process of identifying and breaking things down into a todo list (aka backlog).\n\nOne last thing, I’d recommend looking into therapy as an additional resource. I know that it can be expensive and might feel useless, but here’s my take on it: it’s not some sort of silver bullet solution to all your problems. If you can consider “cutting down on weed and strengthening my SWE foundation” as a long-term project, then therapy is a great resource to use along the way. It’s similar to what you did here, you posted how you were feeling and some advice and strategies were recommended. But with consistent therapy, each session is like a check-in: here’s what we talked about last time, here’s what I tried, and here’s where I struggled. It’s a continuous, iterative development process, much like how we build good software products!\n\nGood luck, you’ve got this!",

It's extremely debilitating and in some sense the root of all the issues you're wanting to buck right now. I would honestly put the work stuff on cruise control and focus on coming to a better place with weed. The simplest, hardest, and most effective place to start is to quit weed entirely and start running, or anything you can tolerate that gets your heart rate up. Eat candy, drink some beer, watch TV, do whatever helps to avoid actually smoking weed. If you have a good support network, lean on them. But doing whatever you can to get your heart rate up and not smoke weed is going to help you more than anything. You can DM me if you want, it's a pretty weird and isolating kind of addiction that most people don't really take seriously unless they've been through it",

So if asked how to solve the same problem, even at a high level, these people generally cant come up with an answer.\n\nThis results in a lot of suboptimal code as the developer settles for \"it works\" because they dont know how good code should look like. Right now AI is decently good, but in my experience, the more you have to keep re-prompting for changes, the worse and worse it gets. So not having a clear direction for what something should look like before engaging AI can sometimes lead to horrible code as you don't know how to course correct because you dont even know what the course is.\n\nAs a new junior developer, your work is probably very simple and things that AI can handle really really well. But as you progress in your career and tackle more complex issues that AI just isnt good enough at yet, you will need to have critical thinking and problem solving skills that I think you are not developing because you are so reliant on AI.\n\nThis ended up being a bit of a soap box for me, but tldr: solve the problem on your own and use AI as a faster typing interface so you can develop your problem solving skills better.",

A little harmful to readability, but most compilers will disregard these anyway.\n\nOne recent example I've seen, is enforcing \"code deletions and additions must have test coverage\" on a large legacy/enterprise codebase. Effectively, what this means is that you either need a lead to sign-off on an exception (pretty easy to get), or that when you change the legacy functions, you must add enough test coverage to \"prove\" that it works.\n\nOtherwise, the scanners because just another step to the compiler.

In terms of transitioning understanding the domain you’d be working in is as important if not more so than your technical experience, so if you can find an SA role that is focused on the industry you work in now that’s probably the best way to get your foot in the door. Interview process was relatively easy, not highly technical. I was asked to describe in detail my technical work on my resume to basically check that I have a basic level of technical skill and can approach a new project, do research, build any required new skills, and execute, but no leetcode or anything. Obviously being personable and charismatic is relatively important as well. \n\nI’m at a Mag7 company. I believe SAs here are paid roughly 10% less than equivalent level SWEs but the pay is more than double what I was making in my last job at a Fortune 25 non-tech company as a SWE. WLB here is good with the caveat being that any SA role is likely going to require some travel. I’ve traveled approximately 6 times in the last year which isn’t terrible but I have colleagues who are traveling once a month or more.\n\nI’d say career trajectory is good, in my company SA has a high level of visibility, and because it’s a very versatile role that spans sales, product, and engineering I think it would be fairly easy to transfer into TPM or engineering from here. I don’t personally find the work as fulfilling as SWE but I also think that’s partially because I haven’t quite hit my stride yet. I have zero regrets about the transition in because of what I gained financially. I may try to transfer into a SWE role once I’m able to though.",

The whole functional programming paradigm, ES6, components, props, how renders work, Redux - all of it felt like trying to drink from a fire hose. I had anxiety and panic attacks over it. So I want you to know: this transition is genuinely hard, and you're not failing because you're finding it hard.\n\n\nThat perfectionism/ADHD piece your therapist mentioned is huge though. Modern frontend development, especially in complex codebases, IS a constant stream of \"wtf is happening\" moments. Even seniors get lost in deeply nested components with no documentation. The difference is they've built up tolerance for not knowing and can sit in that discomfort longer.\n\n\nAlso, you lost your mentor. That's massive. You went from having someone who understood the codebase to basically being on your own in a system with minimal documentation.\n\n\nThe isolation is probably making everything worse too. Even if you go to the office and those people don't understand your specific codebase - they've been through what you're going through. We all have, even if we don't show it or are too proud to admit it. You could try working from coffee shops sometimes too, just to break up being alone all day.\nFor me, it took 1-2 months of really intense, focused work before things clicked. But what forced me to lock in was when the stakes got really real. That kind of pressure made me focus in a way nothing else does, but it's also not sustainable or healthy long-term.\n\n\nYour manager's job is to help you thrive - you could try being really open with them about needing more structured support after your mentor left. Pair programming helped me a ton - you get to ask questions in real time and it actually makes both people more productive. If you ask your manager or even just another dev to pair with you on some tickets, most people would probably be down. And when you're stuck solo, timebox it - give yourself 30 minutes to struggle, then ask.\n\n\nYou're 9 months in. That's still early. But you also need to be honest with yourself about whether this specific situation is set up for you to succeed.",

I talk about initiatives I spearheaded like better unit testing and database mapping and coding quality for contractors. Things I genuinely cared about.\n\nThere's a \"greater picture\" that I picked up over time. Talking about what I like and dislike in tech stacks, how we don't always get to use the technology we want, never enough hours in the day to do everything we want, how I've held offshore accountable but no micro-managed them, how I never complained about 5am deployments because I don't want to burden someone else, how I brought new hires up to speed when there's no set program, etc.\n\nAll stuff I picked up with work experience. Nothing I read on a message board or guide. I don't force any of those topics into the interview but I go into them if related to the conversation. It's a long list.\n\nI try to come across as semi-entertaining. The interviewer should like listening to me speak. I sound confident. I also speak more slowly in interviews than IRL to give the interviewer more time to take notes and understand and I can also start an answer without fully thinking it through. You can't just pause for 3 seconds before speaking. Or you can but long pauses look bad.",

I may have been a \"high performer\" at this company, but realistically I was still a pretty shit SWE with 15 YOE when compared to SWEs at actual tech companies.\n\n> had disagreements with management that ended up costing me my job. \n\nDepending on what the disagreements are management may be in the right.  I lost a job because of \"disagreements\", but it basically came down to I called the out on their shit.  There as a lot of lip service to burnout and shit like that, but nothing every changed because the \"project is too important\".\n\nThe project is so important that we were 15 months late getting FDA approval on the medical devices and still got a company party celebrating the victory.  Never mind there was 0 effort to figure out why were were late as to no repeat mistakes.  It was probably the right decision to just let me go.   \n\nFunny thing was, after the left me go over the next 10 months 5 out of 7 Senior SWEs left along with 2 other midlevel SWEs. \n\n> I am already struggling to get responses since losing my job. I know I need to be prepared to be job searching for 6 months, but other people I talk to that have experience seem to have no problem having recruiters reach out or getting responses/interviews.\n\nIt's a tough market out there and everybody is different.  Maybe you are not marketing your value well on your resume or applying to the wrong jobs.  If you are only looking at top tech companies then you have to expect competition for people working at other top tech companies.\n\nI have also been looking for a new job over the last couple of years and this year I got very few calls to interview from my applications.  I worked on safety critical medical devices for 15 years and have lead teams over that time in addition to being an IC.   I'm basically an embedded application SWE working with mostly c and c++ which is not really what the industry wants.\n\nIt's not even an issue of only wanting remote work as I am more than happy to go into the office, but sadly I cannot just relocate anywhere due to family reasons.  That doesn't mean no relocation, but the city needs to be a place the whole family is in on or people are going to have a bad time.\n\n>So far, I have gotten nothing but 2 rejections (no interview), and 2 ATS rejections from LinkedIn easy apply jobs. I'm not just using easy apply, but maybe something is wrong with my resume?\n\nThat's nothing you have barely started interviewing.\n\n>I'm not just using easy apply, but maybe something is wrong with my resume? \n\nPost your resume in the resume review thread or on resume review subreddits to get feedback.  Things like use STAR and show impact is a common comment.\n\n>Is the job market just that toast right now, even for people that have a little bit of work experience? \n\nCompanies are hiring, but the supply of candidates is large and hiring managers are being selective.

No one wants to hear how a proper deployment pipeline will save time, prevent bugs, etc. But, they will listen if you implement a simple pipeline that shows what you're advocating for.\n\nIf something is useful, implement it and prove it and report your results to the team.

Meanwhile, when we see other people's work, it's because they landed something, solved some problem, gave some slick presentation, etc. Don't compare yourselves to others. You will invariably be comparing your messy practice sessions to their greatest hits.\n\nThree: When the great jazz guitarist Pat Metheny was asked by an interviewer how he got so good, he responded \"easy, I made sure I was the worst guy in every band I was in.\" Talk to the people whose work you admire. Ask them how they think about problems. If you see a slick piece of code or a clever solution, give it the old \\`git blame\\`, figure out who wrote it, and message them saying it's cool and asking how they came up with it. Pay attention in code reviews. Get a mentor who is more senior in the same org and role as you. Even if you are the worst guy in the band right now, *that's the position where you do the most improving*.\n\nI've been where you are now, and it sucks, but it doesn't suck forever. Stick it out, ask lots of questions, and trust that you'll get better with time.",

Last the year the US graduated [170,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86rdUhx-b4U&t=532s) CS majors, up from [50,000](https://archive.is/mPNcX) in 2012.\n\nNo one cares your side projects unless they go viral. No one will look at a GitHub you list on your resume that could easily be plagiarized. HR doesn't code. Can code on your own if you want to learn tech stacks but no need to polish for sharing.\n\nYou're seeking entry level work. You just have to know the basics. Most of CS is work experience. Your #1 goal is to get an internship in any part of CS. Oh you know this. If you don't, your odds of having a job at graduation tank. You're competitive applying in your 3rd semester for the upcoming summer.\n\nAn AI job is not an impossibility with work experience but the real AI work requires graduate school education. Can be in CS or Electrical or Computer Engineering. Entry level job might masquerade it's AI to bait and switch you. Oh you can use GitHub Copilot, big whoop.\n\nUniversity prestige is very important for consideration of internships and entry level jobs, then maybe never matters again. If you're US, I call Tier 1 a Top 40 or 50 program or #1 or #2 in your state. If you're at shit tier, you need to transfer up. You're not going to have 200+ companies recruiting on campus for CS and engineering students and HR is more likely to not read your resume.\n\nFor now, make good grades, apply yourself and pursue what you're passionate about, whether in CS or not. Recruiters like seeing passion. I was into camping and hiking. Hackathons are a decent use of your time. Working with others is a valuable skill, both in general and to recruiters.",
