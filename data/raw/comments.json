He was an MBA who got dumped on the data team because he was the CFO's buddy who had fucked up one too many times on the finance team.\n\nThings he did while managing the small data team:\n\n1. Set up the initial infrastructure as a single prod database that read directly in from sources. No stage, no transformation layer, just source straight into prod. No backups either, and he thought backups were an extra expense we didn't need.\n2. Stored patient phone numbers and zip codes as numbers, dropping all leading zeroes for about four months' data until he put that into a reporting table and freaked out about why so many rows were wrong.\n3. After fixing the phone number issue, he decided to use phone numbers as a patient table's primary key, \n4. This is my all-time favorite: he put unhashed SSNs in a table that was fed into Tableau, so that all of our practice administrators could see the SSNs of all the patients across all of our practices. *Huge* security issue.\n5. Lied about a dozen times on a questionnaire about security practices for a data sharing deal the company wanted to do with BCBS. We were incredibly lucky that our privacy officer caught that on the way out and corrected things, although she ended up being the one who took the heat when BCBS said \"Oh *hell* no\" to the deal after seeing how sketchy things were.",

Avoid trying to load the whole thing into memory at the same time and it shouldn't take too long even without parallelizing it.\n\nIf you can filter rows based on a filter that only accesses a small number of the 400 available features, do that as often as possible so you don't waste compute trying to parse the entire line (all 400 features) for every row. Your goal should be to expose your CPU and RAM to as few rows and columns as possible. It will take some knowledge of the data distribution on how to do that most efficiently.",

Managing 100+ metrics across multiple tools without a single unified view becomes a governance nightmare. Each tool ends up with slightly different calculations, and nobody knows which version is the correct one. A semantic layer gives you one source of truth.\n\nBut don't you need to derive the data that's going to provide this unified view? Doesn't that involve precisely the calculations that drift apart over time? So what's the semantic layer doing other than adding yet another bunch of transformation?\n\n> The key is the semantic logic layer, abstracting the physical world from the modeling world.\n\nThat sounds like horseshit to me. Both layers are abstractions, both layers are models, neither layer is physical - or rather, both layers are supported by physical hardware and eventually boil down to fluctuating voltages and so they're both physical in that sense, but neither is any more physical than the other. The question isn't whether one level of abstraction is more physical than the other, but what the new abstraction provides that the old one didn't and whether it makes life easier.",

Sure you can have an analyst make on the fly queries, but as soon as you automate that querying and store the result somewhere, you have a gold layer\n\nA good reason is that this distinction lets you keep your silver layer very data-centric instead of consumer centric. You can store things in columns such as ID - Atrribute Name - Attribute value without flattening them, which makes ingestion transparent. Or you maintain link tables and cross referentials, without having to decide upfront what the precise grain is\n\nSo your gold layer can be:\n\n* the PowerBi datamodel, Tableau view or anything an analyst generates directly\n* a curated layer specifically for a consumer (Marketing datamart, Sales datamart on another grian, pre-aggregated finance figures to show year to date on the book year, ...)\n* views or tables designed to be consumed by a specific consumer, such as pre-filtered reports or tables that generate a daily outbound file to be consumed by another tool\n\nThis may not be \"by the book\", but this is what I've always seen in practice",

Yes, this is my personal pet peeve. </rant>\n\nWhen you start joining things for the semantic layer, you are assigning purpose to them. For example, if you create a star, how you join the dimensions to the fact table gives meaning (explicit or implicit) to the data that may not be true in all instances. Those data products are meant to keep your core available for all purposes and not any specific one. That being said, you could query to the core layer directly, but it may not perform as well as the semantic layer. The core is more about the relationships of the data at an overall business layer.

A migration with no validation, a lack of business user validation, and/or a rushed timeline. Projects without validation are almost always dead on arrival. The exception being an incredibly straight forward system (with low customization) that you’ve handled multiple times. I can tell within the first three months if it’s going to flop based on business users lack of engagement and/or validation. \n\nYou could do everything right as far as schema to schema and wind up with the destination enterprise software handling the end result poorly due to rules represented outside the schema (or api) definitions. \n\nEven something as simple as moving files is often overlooked in data migrations between systems, which can range from super straight forward PDFs to custom templates you need to rebuild by passing data into. File type compatibility issues, number of files per record and representation of those files on the front-end, file size limits, etc. \n\nThe fact you’re doing migrations straight into production without validation rounds (using production data) raises a 🚩for a potential long term headache.

This isn't always possible, but I run into a ton of teams that think that as long as a job is batch performance doesn't matter.  They're not thinking about cost, usability benefits of lower latency, or deployment/fix implications of their slow batch jobs.\n   * Missing bells & whistles: simple logging & alerting is fairly easy to address, monitoring can be more, but also driven off logging, etc, etc.\n\nSo, if I ran into a team that wanted to show results fast, this is what they knew, and wanted to defer for a bit trying to figure out best way to run jobs, I wouldn't be too concerned about this approach.",

This experience was a catalyst for my professional growth.\n\nIn that role, **PySpark** was our main framework. We used it to build scalable ETL/ELT pipelines capable of processing massive datasets efficiently. For orchestration, we relied on **Apache Airflow**, which was a game-changer for automating and monitoring our data workflows.\n\nTo manage our code and documentation, we used **GitHub** and **GitLab**. This ensured that our development process was organized, collaborative, and easy to track. For data analysis and validation, I used **Hue** to run queries and visualize data directly on our Hadoop cluster. And for database administration, **DBeaver** was my go-to tool for managing both **MySQL** and **Oracle** environments.\n\nThis exposure to a modern, integrated tech stack was invaluable. It not only deepened my technical skills but also prepared me for the demands of the current job market.\n\n\n\n# > Is It a Bad Career Choice to Stay?\n\nYes, in terms of professional growth, it absolutely is. Your current role is a maintenance position that doesn't challenge you or equip you with the skills needed to be competitive in the modern data engineering field. You're not building new solutions or working with the tools that most companies are using.\n\n\n\n# > Would You Take a Pay Cut to Leave This Situation?\n\nYes, I would. A pay cut is not a loss; it's an investment in your future. Accepting a lower-paying job that uses modern technologies will significantly increase your market value in a few years. Think of it this way: a small short-term loss in salary could lead to a much larger long-term gain in earning potential.\n\nGiven that you're in your early 30s, you have plenty of time to pivot. Use your current low-stress environment to your advantage. Take the time to study and build personal projects using tools like **PySpark**, **Apache Airflow**, and cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure. By actively building this experience, you can turn a potentially stagnating situation into a stepping stone for a dynamic and rewarding career.",

I will hold to this for as long as I possibly can. My point being: remember to pick your career based on how rewarding it feels to you, and not JUST because of the money. Money is very important but it's not everything.",

        "body": "Obviously, great work if you did that alone without much DE experience beforehand. I guess a few points to consider:\n\n1. How will the pipeline behave if the UI changes on the website you are pulling the data from, or if the website is down or behaving slowly? In my own experience, Selenium is quite limited to basic actions like “wait for page to load” or “wait until the export button appears.” I would assume you, as a BI Analyst, would probably know when the UI change happens since you are closer to the business user. But still, you don’t (at least you have not mentioned it) have any sort of monitoring or alerting and are just relying on everything working smoothly. So I would advise thinking about adding logging and alerts for those cases.\n2. Again, this kind of follows the second point, but it would probably make sense to add some retry logic when pulling the data if the website is slow on that particular day.\n3. Raw data is usually pretty fucking bad, and it’s the task of a Data Engineer to make the business see only pretty fucking good data. What I mean by that is: do you have any validation in place to prevent bad data from getting into your Power BI models? You mentioned you are pulling customer data profiles and geolocations, and this kind of data is soooo easy to get messed up - it’s insane. For example, postal codes being bad, or missing pieces of an address, like the street being available but not the city, etc. So I would think about adding some sort of validation for your data, if it’s not already part of the transformations you are doing.\n4. You are pulling the Excel files, applying and saving them, and then reading them and saving as parquet. Why? Literally, no offense, but why? You have two versions of the same file in different file formats stored. I would probably store the raw Excel files somewhere for archival purposes so that if you need to check the raw data, you don’t need to re-download them. But I would store transformed files directly in parquet to avoid unnecessary reads/writes.\n5. Create/replace tables is a simple, working strategy, which is cool, but really inefficient for big tables since you have to reload everything. I would suggest checking out `MERGE` or `INSERT...ON CONFLICT` statements for incremental updates so that if a row is unchanged from the previous table version, you don’t need to reload it. Also, I assume your SQL commands look like: `CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT * FROM 'file1.parquet';` Which is normal, but I would advise wrapping it in transaction logic. What does this mean? Imagine your tables fail in the middle, and you have 10 tables. Now you are stuck with 5 updated and 5 old tables - sucks, right? To ensure that your group of loading operations is atomic (meaning they either all succeed or all fail together), you must manually wrap them in a transaction block. That way, you know for sure that either all of them were updated, or all of them are in their previous state, but the data is still consistent between them.\n\nAgain, what you did is really solid, especially for your first time, but maybe my wall of text will help you a bit. I am also open to any comments since I suck at DE and maybe messed up somewhere. Be very proud of what you designed.",

It's constant learning, even as an experienced engineer, whenever I switched to a new stack, I needed between one and two years to be proficient at the local stack and the local software. Good engineering managers know that and will mostly expect you to demonstrate that you are proactively learning by asking questions and reaching out to seniors to get help.\n\nIf you're good at SQL and have some experience with proper software engineering (git), dbt should be easy for you to pick up in a couple of weeks. Just follow their guides and best practices to make sure you use it correctly and in a way that is easy to follow by another dbt user.  \nSnowflake is probably the best hands-off OLAP distributed database, if you're good at SQL, there should be no difficulty. As with any data processing tool, the key is to focus on their documentation about optimizing query performance (partitioning, clustering...).\n\nSo, the learning is not going to be a problem, I think the hardest is going to be passing the selection in the current market.",

We all learn at different speeds and excel at different things.  People who make great analysts could be awful engineers.\n\nAlso depends on the expectation of your company.\n\n>For context I'm kind of in an odd spot where I've joined a new company working as an 'automation engineer' where the company is quite tech immature and old fashioned and has kinda placed me in a new role to help automate a lot of processes with an understanding that this could take a while to allow for discovery, building POCs, getting approval for things etc.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a great start for a flexible career.  Most companies need automation more than the latest tech and tools.\n\n>Has anyone gone through something similar?\n\nSelf taught across 6-8 months, so a lot less experienced than yourself, and went straight into a DE role.  Learning on the job was very fair in my first role because I filled a gap they needed - automation and modernisation.  In an ironic way, I know I just say companies need automation more than the latest tools, however, this role was fun because my job was to learn the latest tools and see how they could be offered to clients internally and externally.\n\nAfter 18 months, I got my second job.  Learning became a lot easier because I had already seen most things before.  The same patterns crop up and it was a lot more battling very poor design decisions made by members of the team as well as external contractors although still doing the same thing.",

Do one pass to get the roster of IDs, store that set, then on each poll diff the set to find new and missing IDs.\n\nHere are a few things that worked for me in the past on similar issues: For updates, fetch in batches but avoid refetching everything every time. Keep a raw bronze table of the exact JSON per employee keyed by employee_id plus poll_time and a content_hash. If the hash changed since last poll, mark it changed and upsert into your modeled tables. If an ID disappears from the roster for a few consecutive polls, tombstone it. Add last_fetched_at and last_changed_at in your modeled table, and keep headers like ETag or Last Modified if the API gives them.\n\nStart with a tiny script using requests plus a small state store in Postgres (or just a json file), and land raw to object storage or DuckDB. Polling is still fine here, but tier it by heuristics. Recently created or recently changed IDs get polled more often, long lived records get sampled less. Backfill can be a manual trigger, then switch to a low frequency poll. This avoids full refresh while staying honest about data quality.\n\n roughly how many employees and what rate limit do you have, do you need SCD2 history or is last write wins fine, and how should deletes be represented in the warehouse?",

Treat S3 as the \"immutable log\", partition by table then ingest date and hour using the Debezium event time ts\\_ms, and write Parquet with reasonable file sizes so Redshift can scan fast.\n\nIn Redshift, instead of the sink, optionally, you can create an external table over staging for cheap ELT, then build a deduped view or table by using row\\_number over partition by primary key ordered by ts and the Debezium op so you keep the latest non delete.\n\nIf you need a current table for BI, schedule a merge from that deduped view into a skinny current table with sort key on the primary key and updated\\_at. This avoids constant vacuum churn from doing small upserts, and you still get perf. If you need point in time queries, keep the bronze and build a silver that is deduped by key and day.\n\nDo you need only latest or point in time? Do deletes happen a lot or rare? How big are the hot tables and what is the 95p change rate?\n\nIf you opt for the \"zero-ETL\" approach, for organization, keep your data in S3 partitioned like `s3://your-bucket/db_name/table_name/dt=YYYY/MM/DD/hr=HH/`. That layout plays nice with Redshift Spectrum and makes pruning way more effective when you're querying or loading batches. Helps a ton with downstream compaction and dedup too, since you can scope it to a smaller time window instead of scanning everything.\n\nDedup pattern is primary key plus Debezium ts\\_ms or source commit lsn, with a tie breaker on op where create beats update beats delete. Partitioning matters for both Spectrum pruning and for batch merge windows, so compact small stuff like five minute files into larger hour files.\n\nAlternatively, if you want a no fuss route, Estuary can land CDC into Redshift with append only and handle dedupe and merges cleanly.

        "body": ">What level of SQL/Python should I realistically aim for?\n\nA really common question and the answer is it completely depends as expectations differ from company to company.  You can get the archetypal trope of \"Do impossible question for interview, only need `SELECT * FROM` in the job\" to getting a competency style interview where they focus more on seeing what you think.\n\n>How do I bridge the gap between tutorials and production-level knowledge?\n\nI think this is in itself a bit of a telling question when asked because it's under the impression that \"production grade\" is something magically different when it can be succinctly described as building something which isn't total shit.  How is something not total shit? It depends on the feedback from your manager and your team as long as it's constructive and makes sense rather than comments like \"I don't like it\".\n\nConceptually, most things you are going to make for a company should have the ambition to reach production, thus, it should be as complete as possible.\n\nIf it's something only you use personally, then it doesn't matter what it looks like.\n\nIf it's something somebody else will see or use, it shouldn't be shit.  It should be predictable, easy to understand and use.  Simple to make changes.  Flexible for reuse.  Testable to some degree (depends on your platform).  Observable at all required points.  Be CI/CD'able (yes, CI/CD resistant systems exist).",

Usually you know what you are trying to achieve with a policy, so you can just go through the docs and find the right arguments. \n\n* Do you typically modify existing templates that your company has already created?\n\nSometimes. Sometimes it's from scratch-ish if I'm setting up something that doesn't already exist. \n\n* Or is this task often handled by a dedicated DevOps, Cloud, or Security team, especially in larger companies?\n\nI don't know about larger companies, and even then I expect it would depend on the company. In the companies I've worked at (startups / medium) the data team had their own AWS sub-account where we could implement whatever tools/policies we wanted - the official devops folks were focused on production architecture. We definitely worked with them and did some security reviews tho. \n\n\\> Should I dive deep into the IAM JSON policy syntax, or is it more important to have a strong conceptual understanding of what permissions are needed for a pipeline, and then learn to adapt existing policies?\n\nDon't bother learning the syntax unless that's going to be 90% of your workload. Copy paste is going to be your friend, and then you can adapt as needed. Keep in mind the principle of least privilege and you'll be fine - you always start from zero and only add access to what you need. But what you need is gonna depend on what you're trying to do (read? write? etc.) Architecture is much harder than the syntax piece.",

In my case its more like, \"Hey I'm trying to deploy this lambda that needs to access an S3 bucket but its blocking the access for the functions IAM role\".  He then jumps on and configures whatever access my user account needs to be able to access.  But then I still need to figure out how to write the Infrastructure correctly in the cloudformation template to tie everything together when I deploy it.\n\nIts literally just me and him though who are developers and we are just getting our feet wet with AWS at our company.  So our infrastructure is not very complex and still not too tied into the AWS ecosystem.  So the policies are quite basic.",

I'm probably not following what this subreddit would consider to be best practices, but here's what I did:\n\n* Built out a Python ETL platform that allows me to generate pipelines using JSON config files. The pipelines ingest Excel files directly from our local network, transform and clean the data, and pop it into an on-prem SQL Server database. My platform is modular and extensible, so I tend to add/update functionality as needed.\n* I use dev/test/prod environments in the DB but haven't done bronze/silver/gold layers. Monitoring is manual right now (log files!) but I plan to migrate to Prefect and/or implement some Power BI dashboards that consume my logs.\n* I avoid manually-managed documentation wherever possible, because that will be the first thing to go out of date. Instead, I'm using JSON schemas and GitHub Actions to automatically generate documentation for my config files on push, and docstrings + pdoc + GitHub Actions to do the same for my codebase. Only manually-maintained documentation is the top-level README for the repo.\n* Power BI is a star for me. Getting the on-prem gateway running was painful, but I've established dev/test/prod environments where I control access. Users can access the dashboards via Teams or, in some cases, export the semantic models to Excel for further analysis. I'm also using PBIB files so I can manage dev in GitHub.\n\nIn terms of general approach, I would start slow and be responsive. Full-stack data analysis means you're also your own PM, so be sure to communicate well and be able to justify your choices to stakeholders. Figure out your P0 items that are crucial for what you're building and then go build it. As you work on this, you'll naturally identify new concerns and priorities and be able to respond to those. Having a vision for what you want to do will help you build for the future--for example, I want to manage my configs via a website, so I established JSON schema rules that unlocked automated documentation--but your vision should remain flexible.\n\nGood luck!\n\n(Edit: Formatting)",

You may be able to implement this with your ingestion pipeline. \n\nHowever, it seems like the next logical step is to get an actual database, like Postgres or SQL Server so that you can do indexing and schema enforcement. Then, design an API to push data to the database and ingest out of the database rather than sharepoint.\n\nIf you cannot do this, one thing that might help is to implement data validation within the xls files.

Our customers use us closely with dbt and we support column-level transformations at ingestion so your models can stay clean. Although I will note that we do not have our own transformation tool like Fivetran's version of dbt. \n\nWe’re built specifically for high-throughput CDC. 1B updates/day on a single table is within range, and we regularly see customers replicating 10K+ tables across mixed workloads (some high-churn, some low-volume). The system is designed to isolate bottlenecks, so one noisy table won’t slow everything down.\n\nIf you’re interested, happy to share more details or chat through your setup.",

It should bring back chunks semantically related to health checks. From the metadata of these chunks, you can get what tools are bound to be useful for this task. Notice I didn't mention the LLM yet, we'll circle back to it later.\n\nOk, so you have a few chunks from man pages and pointers to various tools. Passing all the man pages may be too much, so, what to do? One option is pre-generating one summary per tool, including things like required arguments, and sending it along with the chunks you found. That's a middle term between option A and B.\n\nNow going back to the LLM call in step one. Why do you need that? You need it to generate good questions, not good answers. The vector store will bring you the answers, but if you only send the last line the user types, it can be something like \"What flags can I use to format the output?\" It's lacking content. The LLM is there to read this, along with all the conversation, and turn it into something like, \"What tool do I use to run health checks, and what flags can I use to format its output?\" That has a much higher chance to bring the chunks you need. It doesn't need to know your tools, only how to formulate a good question to surface those chunks from the vector DB.",

Home page items are the most popular items and the best selling products are the top performers in revenue -- they could have some overlap.\n\nThe once-per-month refresh is only on this report alone, but the rest of the reports being asked are all standard.",

Go back to your management and convince them to apply the concept of an analytics window. \n\nI have worked on this problem multiple times already, most notably with logistics. It’s the same concept with deliveries in that open orders on the last few days of the month will only be closed many days after. My advice is that you get the highest possible time that the order is closed, use that as your window, and only calculate by then. This is similar to intra-day calcs where hourly measures have maybe a window of a few minutes, a variance expectation, and an end-of-day resolution via batch job. \n\nAs an example: if closing an order takes 4 days maximum like in your case, then calculate your close rate on the morning of the 5th. Basically, you’ve given all open orders from the previous month the appropriate waiting time to close. This way, you can properly report on them already.\n\nWhat of the still open orders by then? Consider them unresolved. This is an analytical tradeoff your management should accept on a monthly basis. If they find this problematic, then do multiple checkpoints: an initial view a day after the month (highest number of open orders), a view after the initial window, i.e. T+5, and a view maybe 2 weeks after. At that point, you should be able to have extreme confidence in your data. Variance should be very low, except in extreme outlier circumstances.\n\nIf revenue is being tracked using this order system, well… you’re doing it wrong. Or rather your company is doing it wrong. They should be doing that off of your invoice system, not your analytical data. It can be a placeholder, sure, but nothing says money earned as well as money that actually arrived in the bank etc. The best you SHOULD tell your stakeholders is that this is estimated revenue from orders and that it is not indicative of actual money coming in. That is for the finance department to resolve, not yours. You’re a data engineer. And unless your name is Harry, you’re most probably not a wizard either.\n\nOverall, your approach can be solved by educating your stakeholder/client/management and reaching a compromise with them. Otherwise, you are in for a world of pain.",

Good data engineering benefits from a perspective that plants trees you'll probably not enjoy the shade of. \n\nComment your code with intent, explain the reason why you are doing what you are doing in that moment in documentation and note when you are doing the same thing multiple times. When you first start it is often easy to build something that works initially but is ultimately not going to scale or isn't maintainable. Learning from those times helps you think about the bigger picture and understand the true scope of a given ask. \n\n\nExample: the company is recording things in Excel files and they want you to make some of the data available in a consolidated dashboard. You could just grab the specific data/fields from the files and write them to a database then point a dashboard to it. That would fulfill the request but then in 6 months they realize they want other data from those old Excel files and you need to reprocess them again to get the rest of the data. \n\nWhereas if at the start you consider the durability of the files and potential future needs vs. Cost of storage you may have taken everything from those files. Then when the ask for more of the data eventually comes you can provide the data in a fraction of the time and you've ensured that everything is backed up in case some accidentally deletes a source file.",

Be willing to fail, set expectations correctly, ensure you are always at least delivering real business value along with any exploratory skill buildings projects.\n\nfor the bad, be aware that you do not have a real mentor and whatever way you come up with may not be the best way and always seek to challenge your own positions and decisions. You may also not get the budget to roll out snowflake/databricks or any of the enterprise grade tools\n\nWhat I’d do, keep reading and asking questions. Follow the big companies and names you see on here on LinkedIn. Bookmark stuff that sounds interesting even if it doesn’t apply to you yet. Work with business to set goals for what they want out of data and strive to come up with a plan that meets that. That’ll keep you grounded. Find OSS tools that are analogs to the enterprise tech but costs you nothing for small business workloads (airbyte/dlt instead of fivetran, Postgres instead of snowflake, Dagster/prefect and dbt)\n\nPush yourself really hard for 3 years and you’ll be more competitive than you think!",

On one hand, you will have access to unlimited opportunities, use cases and business problems you can take on and go after yourself. On the other, you’ll find yourself cursing alot due to persistent frustration while this rocket wobbles all over the place. \n\nI tend to describe working at a startup as “an unlimited buffet”. You CAN eat until you throw up. But you must love the interim experience upto the point of throwing up in the metaphor. \n\nIn terms of learning and growth, don’t expect someone to hold your hand, or build you a structured learning path or tell you what to do or how to do it. YOU are going to be doing all of that for yourself. \n\nLastly, you will need to have a very high tolerance for frustration and lack of documented information, well defined standards and processes, crystal clear priorities and just pain overall. If you get frustrated easily because the business requirement wasn’t clear for you to immediately start coding your data pipeline or SQL query, then startups aren’t a viable place to work for you. \n\nHaving said all of that, you WILL NOT find a more buzzing, lively and exciting opportunity to work and learn. It’s the same kind of thrill people get when going on those super risky rides, knowing that you might fall from the sky but the adrenaline rush of doing one is rewarding enough to go for it. So my advice? GO FOR IT!!",

Additionally, you can probably BS a later cover letter, resume, or interview and speak to things that you \"did\" with enough knowledge and business context to explain them.\n\nA few books are very commonly suggested here, the top two of which are \"The Data Warehouse Tool-kit\" and \"Designing Data Intensive Applications\". I haven't yet read the former but am reading through the latter. It's definitely a complicated book as it greatly goes into detail on different paradigms and applications. In fact, it may be a bit too dense too soon; either beforehand, or as they arrive, I would also look into tools that are similar to what your company is using. Learn what the differences are and try to understand why one may have decided to go with your current stack, and why one might want to move away from it.\n\nLastly, for now, I stress paying attention to soft skills. I've been burned before being the only person at a start-up (kinda, it was complicated and I was largely separated from anyone else who may have been able to help, and they have largely different priorities). My boss had certain expectations that were tough to realize, partly because of these different priorities. I could've done better to manage them, to an extent. Alas, this led to my being let go - wouldn't want this to happen to you.",

If there aren't any that suit your needs then python as a first class citizen enables you to make custom processors.  Lastly I know it was touched upon but there was a shift from flow.xml.gz to flow.json.gz, so depending on what your version is on 1.x you might need to hop twice for the encryption (mentioned) and conversion as both files exist for some later versions and only the json is needed in 2.x",

The entire purpose behind RDBMS like Postgres is that it gives you these commands to operate on data locally with all the tooling to make it as efficient as possible because it understands the source and destination table structures.\n\nMerge statements would be very generic. You could make a pretty simple jinja template to use as a code generator, just putting the target table name and column names as params. Make that output a procedure definition, and as long as you stick to the pattern that's all you have to write manually. You should be able to automatically scrape all the parameters you need using information_schema -- the whole thing could be a single python script to automatically generate everything.\n\nYou have your spark insert to a staging table (truncate first if you don't include a partition column), then run the procedure.\n\nIf they don't want to deal with all of these objects too much, they can have a separate schema to put them in.\n\nUltimately making spark do the work if figuring out what is an insert, update, or delete, is going to be very wasteful in shuffling data back-and-forth, and you're running two sets of compute when it could be one.",

You've just used words from different technologies and slapped them together. \n\nFabric offer pretty much nothing that Synapse doesn't - the \"one Lake\" approach is a new feature that dilutes the whole concept of \"single source of truth\". And Fabric doesn't support data flows.\n\nSynapse is a solution for enterprise needs, it can be optimised as you'd expect for that level of usage.\n\nFabric is aimed at \"citizen\" developers, e.g. people who operate as individuals and pull reports together from different sources. The one thing fabric genuinely does better than Synapse is allows you to connect to data sources easily. It's not difficult in Synapse, it's just not very intuitive.\n\nThe easiest way to envision is it:   \n  \nData Factory does a bunch of legacy operations and support basically everything that on prem does, with no need to rewrite it all. it also offers newer ways of doing things but that's not what makes it useful IMO.\n\nSynapse offers true \"PAYG\" data processing which takes the load off your internal systems, and generally will be cheaper than Data Factory but needs a significant rewrite on new technologies (Such as Spark, Python) and a whole new approach to how things are processed. The upside is the power of the servers you can provision is massive, and you only pay for what you use - instead of paying for them 24/7.\n\nFabric offers most of what Synapse does but has a very different interface to Synapse. It also leverages One Lake. The main difference is pricing. In Synapse you need to pay for each resource individually, but in Fabric you pay for \"capacity\" which can range from storage to processing - but it all comes under one payment.\n\nThe reality is that Synapse is a great product that can operate alongside DF, and both of them utilise each other for specific functions, but Synapse is a whole new world. Fabric is aimed to try and give non technical people \"democratised\" data processing - which is a great idea but functionally is very close to giving someone 15 excel files and hoping they know what they're doing when they copy paste from them all that the data is correct at the end.\n\nAll of these technologies need a data platform and approach - trying to sell Fabric as \"better\" is just wild. I know MS are pushing it, but having worked with all 3 technologies AND on prem, i can safely say there are more headaches in fabric than the others because it's solving a problem that data engineers didn't need solved.",

Yes, you need a data platform in both. But there are genuinely significant improvements in Fabric that aren't in Synapse.\n\nYes, Synapse is a very capable platform. But it's also a challenging platform to use well. \n Synapse SQL Dedicated Pools make you choose between best performance (storing in its proprietary internal tables) and open formats (external tables). Scaling is offline, and disruptive. And they require a lot of tuning to get good performance out of them. Synapse Serverless SQL pools are better on that front, but have a lot of limitations of their own.\n\nI genuinely believe Fabric Warehouse is better than them. It gets rid of that division, and has many, many improvements elsewhere, from provisioning (scaling is online like Synapse Serverless SQL Pools, but faster and more intelligent), query optimization (overhauled and distinct from either Synapse SQL Pool offerings), query execution (improved beyond both previous products), and so on. \nI have worked on all 3 products, seen the customer experiences on all 3, and that's my honest opinion.\n\nSimilarly, if you look at Fabric Spark, it has NEE, based on Gluten and Velox, to improve performance and lower costs:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/native-execution-engine-overview?tabs=sparksql\n\nNote that Fabric Spark has a pay as you go billing option:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/autoscale-billing-for-spark-overview\n\nThere have been discussions about expanding that to other workloads where it makes sense, but that's a question for PMs rather than me.\n\nFeature development is focused on Fabric these days, so the engines in Fabric will continue to improve further with time. And as I said above, I genuinely believe they're already significantly better than what we have in Synapse. And unfortunately, many of those improvements are not really feasible to bring to Synapse - we had to do very significant rearchitecting to deliver them, and that rearchitecting means it's not really feasible to put the improvements into the older products, they just weren't designed for it. \n\nAnyway, you don't have to agree with me, that's fine. This is my personal opinion; that's your personal opinion. Reasonable people can have differences of opinions.\nThanks for sharing yours, hope this helps you understand mine a bit better too.",

It's pointless \"distinction without difference\" bullshit, frankly. It's misinformation at best. There's no universal list of knowledge/skill/activity per label (\"programmer\", \"coder\", \"developer\") just like there's no universal list of responsibilities per job title (\"software engineer\", \"programmer\", \"developer\"). Those of us who've been around a while have likely seen and held all of those titles and done the same, and differing, day to day work. Different orgs refer to people and roles slightly differently, absent protections for certain professional titles (e.g. Engineer).\n\nIf you want to say that it takes a programmer (or coder, or software engineer, or developer...) to be able to evaluate the output of LLMs in a particular context in order for LLMs to be useful for building complex software, just say that. There's no need to start splitting hairs over terminology. It just leads to wider confusion, and questions like \"what's the difference between X and Y\" where there is no meaningful difference, or the difference depends on the specific org etc. It also waters down your argument with doublespeak.\n\nThere is no difference between coding and programming. Programmers are very much still needed to build non-trivial, quality software.",

Suddenly you became a kind of semi-hero in the work space? A kind of defacto tech support and programmer (even if that wasn't your main job!). \n\n------------------------------\n\nThe need was so great that... At that point, there's was pretty much nothing you could ever do to get fired! \n\nLike ya... I was younger at that time, and foolish, so even though I didn't control my emotions at some point and even yelled back at the senior founding partner of our firm, I still didn't get fired! \n\nI kid you not: I even got caught late at night in a rather compromising position with a certain colleague, in which her and I were inappropriately hitting it off... and then... well... hit it off one late night, when wouldn't you know it: that same senior partner came into the office unusually to check something. And kinda freaked, then backed out, and never spoke about it to me! (Ya, if that was today, I would have been long fired multiple times!)\n\n------------------------------\n\nAnyways... \n\nSo, I actually got hired by a pretty well known international law firm as a technical writer, since I had done two entirely separate university degrees: one physics, and one English Literature. \n\nYa, I know: that's a strange and weird combo, but those are my 2 loves in life! Despite the fact that unfortunately I'm not all that good in either of them, lol! \n\nBut the law firm dealt in many aspects related to the sciences and engineering, ranging from patents to immigration of highly talented people, etc... So they needed someone who could read scientific papers, and be semi-decent at writing. (As you can see from the length of this comment, I'm a pretty crazy writer: always constantly writing. Just not anything all that good! But still always writing, and I can type at about 90 to 100 words per minute.) \n\n------------------------------\n\nFinally to get to the point, not only did I do technical writing... \n\nBut if anyone had a problem with their computer in the office, my phone line would light up and ring (if the main tech-guy/admin wasn't there yet in the morning, or was already busy). \n\nAnd then people would approach me to help them automate some tasks. \n\nSo believe it or not, I would actually use C++ (taping into Win32) combined with a program called \"Autohotkey\" to do scripting and automation! \n\nLike who uses C++ of all things, to do quick scripting and automation tasks!? Well apparently that would be me! \n\n------------------------------\n\nBut ya, I got the job after I graduated with my second degree, and boy was I surprised by me being thrust into that role, and just rapidly utilizing anything I knew to get the job done, even if it wasn't anything close to 100% the correct language or solution model for the problem. \n\nJust as long as it worked, mostly glitch free, then nobody gave a flying F what programming language or tool I used to get the job done. \n\nAnd because of that, they never-ever-ever wanted to fire me, even though they had to scold me several times. \n\n------------------------------\n\nFast forward to today, and ya... \n\nTimes have really changed, mostly for the worse in this field unfortunately. \n\nI worry the good old fashioned crazy pure days of fun are behind us now in the tech sector, and companies have turned something great into something of misery... \n\nAka: the enshittification of everything by corporations, CEO's and MBA bro culture.",

        "body": "I've been on the other side: interviewing candidates for entry level back-end focused dev positions. Here's my thoughts.  \n\nActive Github profile (daily commits) - not important. \"Daily commits\" is especially not important, some days you just aren't going to have code worth committing. The important part is _having worked on a project of nontrivial complexity_. You had a problem and you tried to solve it... how did you approach the problem, and why did you choose the solution you did? Talking about the candidate's prior work is very valuable as the person trying to understand if the candidate in front of me might be a good fit.  \n\nWell-structured and documented programs (Modular & uses Swagger) - maybe of interest, but just having used tools like OpenAPI (which is the name of the spec for what was called \"swagger\" btw) or readthedocs or redoc doesn't actually tell me anything. Remember, I'm trying to figure out your approach to solving engineering problems. Does slapping swagger-ui into a maven project mean you're any more informed about how or why to use such a tool? Not necessarily. Now, if what you developed had an external API with users that needed to know about/test your endpoints, that's something worth asking about. This could dovetail into asking about other tools like Postman.   \n\n\"Well structured\" is too vague of advice and honestly I'd be wary of anyone preaching this to a new developer. Trying to perfectly architect your work in progress ToDo app is not a good use of time. Get your hands dirty. Learning from mistakes and iterating is the name of the game. Waxing philosophic about how you wanted your first app to scale to thousands of users might be relevant if you're interviewing at Netflix, but anywhere else it's probably just signalling that you didn't really understand when it's appropriate to use the tools at hand, or worse, that you might be the kind of junior dev who needlessly introduces more compexity.  \n\nProjects - yes, very important. Your plan is simple but if you follow through you will be fine. The only thing that stands out to me is that you don't have concrete examples for your projects. You should pick problem(s) that sounds interesting to you and then just work on them. You will inevitably run into topics that you know nothing about (how do I hook up my server to my database? how do I expose this API endpoint? how do I secure my endpoint behind basic AuthN? if my project is depending on other services, how do I rate limit my service so that I don't get angry emails/IP blocked from those services? is there some way I can process this data more efficiently?). If you are able to work on any actively maintained open source project, you can get some \"real\" dev experience before getting your first job.\n\nHere are some of the kinds of basic questions I have in my interview template:  \n\n* What do you do in your current position (if any)?  \n* What side projects have you worked on? Which languages do you use or which are you learning?\n* How familiar are you with <framework>? (e.g. Spring, React, etc)\n* Have you used git or other source control tools? Have you submitted (or reviewed and approved) a pull request before?\n* Do you know what a unit test is? What do you think is the point of tests?\n* Walk me through your side project (if any). What was your role, how did the design go, what were any challenges you ran into? What would you have changed?\n* <coding/logic problem>\n* Can you talk about a situation where someone disagreed with your recommendation, or vice versa, on an important aspect of a project?",

This is a 3-case lex, 3-function recursive descent parse, then single-function tree walk situation, if you want a proper solution. I'd expect the first solution to be some awkward/inflexible string splitting which broke the second the input changed slightly. If I had more than 30 mins I'd ask how it could be made more robust, at which point I'd expect a suggestion like mine above. I probably wouldn't make them code it up though. Just knowing tells me what I need to know about them for the purpose of the interview.  If I had to suggest the improvement, I might see if they could work with me to code it up by asking good questions etc, almost pair programming style.\n\nMy advice in these is always to use the interviewer as a resource as much as possible. Lots of people go very quiet and try to mentally brute force, then fail, when they could have asked for more help from me. I don't know what they need help with specifically without them asking. On the job, it's fine to ask colleagues things, so it's generally not frowned upon in interview either, as long as you're not asking for the full solution etc.\n\nEdit: code in thread below.",

It's only easy from the human perspective. It doesn't take you more than a minute to do that calculation, but you process the string in whatever order you want. That is, if you had had * or /, you would have handled that computation first.\n\nBy contrast, the string is an array of characters, and you have to translate it numbers, plus apply the operator. Because it's infix, it's quite a challenge to do it accurately. As you yourself said, it took half an hour even after you Googled for the C functions you needed.\n\nI suppose the tip is to know you C string functions. \n\nThere is a bunch of ways to solve it. If you could create a second array, you could have replaced +/- with spaces, and then split on that. Then pull out the integers into an array, then process the +/- from the array.\n\nI don't think this is an easy programming problem at all.\n\nAnother person suggested creating a binary tree. That means you'd have to know your binary trees well, and how to put an expression into a binary tree.",

It's good to copy once or twice and follow along tutorials to get a baseline, youve got that part down, but you aren't proving you've learned how to build shit by doing that. \n\nYou need to reframe how you go about this and treat it like learning an actual spoken language. You learn some nouns and verbs (keywords in programming), then you learn some concepts and combine those with your vocabulary (grammar), but you will never be able to speak with just that (speaking = programming).\n\n\nYou can pass a Japanese test and technically \"know\" Japanese this way, but you'll never be able to express your own thoughts to a native. In the same way you can't program your own apps. \n\n\nIf you want to progress beyond the beginners at your stage and speed up your learning, paradoxically you need to slow down. Pause the \"studying\" and \"learning\" you're doing for now and do the same thing youd do for learning a spoken language. Take what you know and form your own sentences and evaluate where you get lost and what you need to learn more of. \n\n\nSpeaking a language = coding a project. Coding is NOT and will not ever be the most difficult part about being a programmer. Coding is hard for beginners and anyone that tells you that coding is the hard part likely does not understand what programming actually is. Build something, and when you finish build something else. Occasionally rebuild something youve already built, maybe add some new tricks youve learned to speed the process up or add features you were unable to the first time.\n\n\nAnd \"i can't build anything yet\" is not an acceptable answer. Day one of a spoken language course you learn how to say \"hello\", day one of a coding course you learn how to say \"Hello World\". Thats a project in the same way that a simple sentence in Japanese is. It's not impressive, but it is by definition a project. Now add complexity to your app. Can you print \"something besides Hello World? Can you make it print that new phrase 10 times? Can you print out what a user types? Can you make that phrase print 10 times? Can you take in more than one string of user input? \n\n\nIf you know how to do those things, you should be able to bang your head against a wall and build a calculator. A little more complicated than \"Hello World\" and takes quite a bit more work, but building it is a lot more feasible than you think. \n\n\nCoding isnt hard. But it takes practice. You've studied, thats great, but you need to put the books aside and go to the gym and get some reps in.",

Knowledge acquisition doesn’t always require understanding before exposure, often repetitive exposure to things that don’t make sense is the foundation of knowledge. It’s how we all learned to speak. Our brains are actually designed to work this way.\n\nSo if you are retyping programming basics like loops, syntax, the use of built in methods, turning an array into a map, the elements of a form that go together, and the js methods that move the info from the front end to the back end, the shape of classes and functions, event listeners and their methods, etc… I think that stuff is okay to copy as long as you type it out line by line. It’s hard to tell while you’re doing it, but you are learning things just by transposing them from the screen through your keyboard. You will inevitably miss a symbol or a letter and you’ll have to scan through and figure out what went wrong. This will help you gain deeper understanding. \n\nEventually you see the patterns. Seemingly disconnected confusing things start to become connected and organized. \n\nAt its heart programming is us training ourselves to be conscious of subconscious steps. Like we never have to think of every individual step of putting on a t-shirt. We just know how to do it. I believe when we program our brain begins to subconsciously understand what is happening which is why (after it clicks) sometimes coding can feel like magic, and why we have to reread and relearn code we wrote two weeks ago. \n\nIf you find yourself copying something that looks familiar too often I would say take some time and focus on the use of that thing by itself. \n\nBut  if you copy paste you’re mostly not learning.",

Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.\n1. Next, implement the base case.\n1. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.\n1. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.\n1. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.\n\n\nThe main thing to know is that recursion is mostly overrated. If your problem involves both 1) a tree structure and 2) back tracking, then it's a good candidate for recursion. Otherwise, if you find yourself asking, \"Why couldn't I just do this with a loop\" then you're right: it's a poor candidate for recursion and you should just use the simpler loop solution.",

But you'd need one stack for the file scanner objects (representing the system's view of the directories you had descended) and another for the data you were building for each directory... and you'd carefully inspect each file object, and push a new file scanner if it was a directory, and carefully handle your end-of-scan issues at each level, popping both stacks... it could get tricky.\n\nNow consider doing it with recursion.  You imagine the functional interface you want – let's say, a File, and a DataSoFar.  Consider your base case – is the File a simple file, not a directory?  Great, you're done.  Produce your output.  Otherwise you need to recurse – okay, it's a directory: update DataSoFar, create a scanner from the File, loop through the scanner and call your function on each of the files.  Boom, done.  The book-keeping and boundary conditions are handled for you by the program stack, and you stick to familiar function calling and error-handling idioms.\n\nThe key leap for me is always that imaginative step: *what's the functional interface I wish I could use to solve one step of this problem?*  Recursion sometimes allows you to achieve that interface with minimal effort and great clarity.",

If you enjoy it, you'll naturally want to do it often, read about it, take courses, etc. - basically, you'll have drive. It takes a certain analytical mind to enjoy coding, but it also takes a creative mind. You have to enjoy making things and solving problems.\n2. Naturally, at first you're going to suck at it. This applies to anything new. When I just started, I was terrible. I once \"randomized\" an array by generating random numbers and putting them in each slot, waiting longer and longer for the correct unused number as the array filled up. You need to push through this learning curve - there's no way around it. It took me about 6 years to become even moderately decent.\n3. You mentioned switching from one language to another. Here's the thing about programming: it's way more about understanding the concepts than memorizing the specific language syntax. If you understand how variables work, how if-else statements function, how loops operate, etc., you're already 80% of the way there with any language. The remaining 20% is just syntax differences you can easily look up when needed.",

First thoughts is I need to have two sets of words, I need to display them and I need to take input. Maybe a database? A gui? Do I know any database? No, okey... do I know any gui? No, do I learn one? Where do I get the words? Do I input them? Do I use any cloud solution?\n\nThis never ending circle of questions, or you could just write a function that takes a word of language L and a word of language K then it returns true if it's correct. Internally it finds the L word in list L and checks if K word matches the word at the same index in list K. This is your core mechanic AND database. You can go even lower and make sure you can match strings at all.\n\nGUI? Once you start considering libraries and frameworks... thats a whole can of worms on it's own...print to terminal first. Solve it \"yourself\" as much as possible first because many 3rd party software is not helpful for you yet. They are complicated and huge because they can handle so much.. add them later.\n\nWordlist? Hardcode it, then use csv or json. Same as above, switch when it is more work not switching.\n\nThe app prototype is done and now you have a much better chance of planning anything or finding answers.\n\nDon't be afraid to write bad code.

The next time you are building one of your own creations, you have some ideas of what pieces you have and how they could be used, so you disassemble some of your sets, and try to use the pieces in different ways in your own creation. Maybe it'll work, and you have to order more pieces like it - or it won't work and you have to imagine something else.\n\nWhen not building you are sorting your pieces, experimenting with connecting them in different ways, trying out small techniques outside of large projects, and you get ideas for how you also could use those pieces, maybe you even get an idea for a large project using the pieces that way!\n\nAlso, you follow builders on social media, and talk with other builders, asking for inspiration, looking inside their creations, and you are always learning!\n\nWhen you have an idea for something, but absolute no knowledge of how to build it, you try sketching it, experiment with the pieces you have, will this fit? No, well how about this? Maybe if I turn that one that way?\n\nYou won't always succeed, and some projects might be abandoned, but you are always learning!\n\n  \nDon't ever expect to \"see\" the magical piece that will solve your exact problem, if you have never worked on anything even remotely similar, or even seen pieces anywhere close to what you need!\n\nAnd don't think that you'll immediately get to know thousands of pieces and how they connect - sometimes you will have to make things \"the wrong way\", or simply \"fake\" them, make a function that pretends to do the work for you, until you learn the right way. Take a look at the LEGO creations by young kids, they almost never look exactly like they should, but they are an appromixation.\n\nSo, answer 1 is: always be learning, experiment with what you have, try to solve it close enough. And answer 2 is: Don't try to look for the perfect solution when you only know 1% of everything that is - look around you, and see if you can get just a little closer to your goal!

        "body": "For number 2, I've had to deal with that forever - I've never been a fan of people using \"I have ADD!\" as an excuse for everything, but programming with ADD is... well, it can be an advantage at times but it can also be a severe disadvantage for that exact reason - before you know it you've got 40 tabs open and are working on three new things completely unrelated to the problem you were trying to solve. \n\nOne thing that helps me is using something to keep track of that sort of thing - a folder, a bookmark app, anything where you can drop everything you come across that makes you go \"that's cool/useful/whatever\" but isn't directly related to what you're doing *now*. Without that, a five minute research search can end with me realizing it's 2 am and I've gotten nothing done. \n\nAs for the rest... it really is just experience, and not feeling bad about the fact that you still need to look stuff up X years in. For example, I've been using PHP for like 20 years and I still have to look up simple functions because I forget the syntax *all the time*. Who cares, though? I know what it does and how it works, not remembering what comes first in a substring isn't the end of the world.\n\nFor me, at least, becoming a better programmer is less about memorization or always knowing what the right \"piece\" is, and is more about a general understanding and \"feel\" for how things work. You might not know if a specific function exists to do what you want, and it sucks to spend the time working on something only to find out later it was as easy as using a function that already exists, but it's probably going to happen to you more than once - but now you know the function exists and you know how to work without it. Figuring out how to do something, even the most trivial \"I'll never need to do this again\" thing, is never a *bad* thing and will help you grow. Maybe later you'll be learning another language that's similar but it doesn't have an applicable function for what you were doing, and it's not a problem because you know how to do it by hand. This probably isn't the most realistic example, the point is that I try to never look at \"I just did more than I needed to\" as a negative as long as it's not causing you to miss deadlines (and as long as it's not happening constantly).\n\nI'm hesitant to push AI as it's really easy to become overly reliant on it, and you should never rely on code AI slings out without vetting it yourself, but if you treat it like a search engine it's certainly a lot easier to say \"I'm trying to do X with Y and am wondering what methods others currently use\" than to try and get the perfect Google search or scroll through docs.\n\nIt never hurts to join a coding community, either. I haven't done that since usenet but I'm sure there are discords or whatever out there.",

Yes, C++ is absolutely necessary because that is the language used to program consoles and what near all APIs (application programming interfaces) use. Regardless, you are still not wasting time with a language like Python because that is also used in game dev along with a few other languages depending on platform.\n\nAll the C++ toy will learn at this point will only give you an overview of the demands in the industry. I would also suggest that you start making games in your spare time and maybe look at Unreal Engine that uses C++.\n\nIf you don’t have anybody to network with within the industry it will be very difficult to get into too, you need to find game dev gatherings for regular meetups to get your name out there. Look at what IGDA has to offer, it has many resources.",

It’s safe to say that programming is filled with pitfalls that become easier to diagnose or avoid as you gain experience.\n\nFor now, some things to keep in mind are:\n\n- read the installation instructions that come with whatever you’re installing\n\n- read the error messages — they’re often the key to getting unstuck\n\n- try rubber duck debugging: explain the problem out loud to your favorite action figure, Beanie Baby, volleyball, or even a live person",

Not necessarily trivial - I've been programming for almost 4 decades, but I've never learned Rust for instance and if you told me I had to write something in Rust with a gun to my head I of course couldn't do it. But if I got hired for a job and was told \"Oh yeah we only work in Rust\" I'd just go \"Great, I'm excited to learn Rust!\" and not be too intimidated by it.\n\nOnce you've got a strong foundation, your choice of technology will just be driven by what you want to *do* next. You pick something you want to create (or get hired onto a job) and you learn what you need to know as you need to know it. If you're working on getting hired, you pick a project that overlaps strongly with the needs of your local job market, and you learn what you need to make yourself an attractive candidate.\n\nBut if you don't have fundamentals down, go back to working on that. Without tutorials, AI, or any of that junk. Take one of the many free university courses (university courses, even if they're free and not for credit, tend to be much more rigorous than much of the junk on youtube or whatever) and get your data structures and algorithms skills solid, etc.\n\nFirst step though is really assessing where you are right now.",

We wanted them to come away with “programming mindsets” where they could solve a given junior-level problem with loops, conditionals and functions, and an awareness that different languages have different “quirks” in the syntax for these concepts. \n\nFor example, all these languages have for loops, but Python has list comprehensions, JavaScript has array methods that take in callback functions, Java has implementations of the List interface…\n\nGoing further into back end dev, Ruby on Rails defines endpoints as methods on a Controller class, inheriting from the framework’s built-in ActiveController. Java Spring Boot does a similar thing but with decorators, favouring composition over inheritance. Node Express doesn’t have Controller classes/prototypes, instead endpoints are just function properties assigned to an instance of an App object with callbacks to define their behaviour. They all have the concept of endpoints, they all have HTTP verbs and request/response objects, they all push you more or less to an MVC architecture, but very different implementations. Knowing the concept is way more important than knowing only one implementation.\n\nWhen you move to a language you don’t know - say Rust - and you try and implement an endpoint as a Node Express style async function, you’re gonna have a bad time. But if you google “rust post request endpoint” you’ll get example code for the Actix Web framework.\n\nKnowing the concepts are way more important than learning the syntax.",

You'll have to learn about databases, SQL and how to make an API, but that's fairly trivial.\n\nFor example, learn about the [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) package and read [Best practices for RESTful web API design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design) and boom, back-end achieved. Next step is about actually saving that data.\n\nTo save data, you need a database and you'll need to talk to it through a Structured Query Language called SQL. You can learn SQL [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/), but then the database stuff gets a bit complicated. You can install MariaDB locally and learn on that, then in the future you'll want to learn about Docker Compose to avoid having to install the DB locally during development and you'll probably want to use PostgreSQL, but right now it doesn't matter. Just go with SQL/MariaDB and learn the concepts.\n\nOnce you've got a database, your Node.js app will need to somehow connect to the database you just installed. For MariaDB, there's a [package](https://mariadb.com/docs/connectors/mariadb-connector-nodejs/getting-started-with-the-node-js-connector) for that.\n\nBoom, back-end with API and data storage achieved, without tutorial, all by yourself. It's the same steps for any programming language.\n\nAdmittedly, that route is what a tutorial would give you, but anyway. Concepts are what's valuable at the moment. Or if you feel like you'd have more fun in Go than TypeScript, then just go for it, it'll be roughly the same thing.",

There is no tutorial, there is no shortcut.\n\nTutorials/courses can teach you the basic skills; they can lay the *foundation*. It is upon you to build the house brick by brick, floor by floor.\n\nYou start with small, simple games and work your way up.\n\nTake the game engine of your choice (I'd recommend Godot for starters) and build something simple, something like e.g. *Tic-Tac-Toe*. Then venture into more complex territory, e.g. something like *Battleships*. Then, move on to more complex tasks, e.g. *Sokoban (Box Pusher)* - these are all fairly simple to make games that will each teach you a lot. To get something more dynamic, the classic *Pong* or *Breakout (Arkanoid clone)* are good starts, but only after you have progressed enough. Make a *Pacman* clone. \n\nUsing old games has the advantage that the entire *game mechanics* are well known and well documented.\n\nWhen you gradually build up your skills you can always venture into larger, more complex games, make the switch from 2D to 2.5D (often also wrongly called Isometric) to 3D.\n\nWith each game you make you will improve your skills, *provided* that you don't just do tutorial after tutorial that creates the game *for* you. At utmost, use the tutorials as inspiration and try to make things on your own. Then, if you fail and can't find a solution, look at the tutorial to see how they did it. Don't just copy the tutorial. First, try on your own. Experimenting, trying, failing, fixing are all part of learning, copying is not learning.\n\nAlso, games are developed *incrementally*. They start with simple mechanics, e.g. how to interact with the player, how to set up the levels, etc. Then, they work with the collisions, and so on. Commonly, the *game art* is quite far towards the end of the development. Sure, you need to know roughly how big your game entities (players, enemies, background, etc.) will be but you don't need to have them fully developed at the start.\n\nGet things working first and then make them good and pretty.",

Feel free to google those keywords yourself, but to start you could look at Vue.js for your frontend, Python’s Flask for your backend, and a NoSQL option like Firebase’s Firestore for your database.\n\nAlternatively, if you plan on running the website off of your computer, you could straight up just use file storage on your device as the database with CSV, JSON, or XML files.\n\nExplaining how all of these parts work together up front would turn this into an essay, but for reference I have not worked with web technology, HTML/CSS/JS, or Python in over a year and I have a solid prototype web app up and running after only a week (40hrs) of development time. All it takes is a lot of googling and some patience. You don’t need to know the entirety of each language to get this up and running, honestly just start developing and learn as you go.\n\nPS: please do not attempt to use AI to make this whole thing for you. It will make up functions that don’t exist and do many other incorrect things and the end result will be you bashing your head against a wall wondering why your website doesn’t work. Read docs, stack overflow, etc and attempt to figure out what is actually going on.",

Sometimes, the companies offering the apprenticeship or their clients will hire the apprentice, which is an easy start in the industry. \n\nAlso - don't fear AI.

Then you will get to apply those basics to build something that _interests YOU_. Useful can also mean, that you are learning something. Maybe you are learning a new language, a new framework, a new library. That is useful as a preparation for other things to come.\n\nWork? Yes, yes ... That will be how you sustain yourself, but most likely, if you are a craftsman, or artist, work will be less interesting, than your own projects. As you progress in skill, your work will probably be simpler, more rote, than your own projects.\n\nAbout interviews: Don't forget, that interviews are a stress situation. Depending on the person, mostly what they test is stress resilience, not your computer programming skill. What you are describing about being given 2h and a bunch of files ... That might as well be badly designed code, that is a trap into bad design. In such a situation you might have to deal with the shit you are given as code, but keep an open mind to alternative solutions.\n\nI have been working for 7y mostly using Python and still I did no good in interviews with live coding. Sometimes it was the requirements, that were too narrow, them expecting one particular solution. Other times I was too nervous and simply couldn't think straight. In contrast to my work experience, in which I basically built a company from the ground up, at least on the technical side, and on my own designed and developed multiple still maintained services, that make the company their money.\nSo mostly my interviewing experience has been quite shit, and it can happen to everyone.

And games are cool and all, and you can actually learn everything there is to programming by building games, but as you say, that's not quite where the jobs are, so it might make more sense to look at something more \"boring\" :)\n\nI'd recommend doing some web-application development with focus on the backend - since you might not need to spend that much more time on frontend right now.\n\nLook more into frameworks and libraries, than \"pure code\", e.g. if you are into **Python, take a look at Django**, and maybe follow some tutorials, get started on building **server side rendered dynamic websites**, and learn all the tricks, patterns and architectures. Build something where you have to think on a higher level of abstraction than while-loops and if-statements, struggle with understanding the framework, and use all your knowledge of the language to build something 'standard'.\n\nYou are \"done\" with learning the programming language, now you have to learn how to build programs - and the easiest way to get started is to follow advanced tutorials, and notice repeating patterns in the way they build things!\n\nAlso, don't forget about the interview-exam - store it somewhere, and pick it up again in a few weeks, try to see if it suddenly becomes easier.",

In the former days, this was an actual ROM, now it is usually some form of erasable programmable memory, like an EEPROM.\n\nThe BIOS then has all the code to carry out the POST (Power On Self Test), plus libraries/functionality to talk with the various hardware components, and the code to then start, in case of a PC, the Operating System, of which the boot-loader is stored in a certain place on the hard drive (SSD, nVme, etc) of the computer.\n\nIn case of the modern UEFI BIOS, this system is usually also stored on the computer's hard drive, but also exists in a storage on the main board so that when you change the hard drive, the computer can still boot.\n\nA good start to understand how everything of this plays together is to look into Microcontrollers, like the 8031/8051, Atmel (Arduino) as they are basically the same as a PC minus the operating system.",

Any Turing complete language, which is effectively all of them, can manipulate state, which is what programs do.  Any general purpose language, which is most of them, can do most tasks.\n\nHowever, where those languages can be used is a function of implementation.  OS broadly, web browser narrowly, your favorite game, maybe Lua.\n\n> Can you give me examples of where some feature is not implemented in a language because it would directly block another feature? \n\nHow about [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)?  How a language lets you define and handle types tends to be a defining feature.  It also will impact every aspect of how you develop a program in that language.  Choose one, block the other.  A strict type system catches errors at compile time, a loose one might only catch some errors at run time.  Write your tests accordingly.\n\nAlong the same lines, [mutablity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object).  This is the break point between imperative and declarative.  The level to which that can be dictated by the programmer also defines a language.\n\n[Function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) comes to mind.  It's extremely popular, lots of languages do it, and lots don't.  There are pros and cons in implementing such a feature.  There is implementation complexity but also programmer expectation.\n\nGarbage collection?  How resources are released is a big deal in all languages.  In some languages, all clean up is the responsibility of the programmer.  In others, the programmer barely has a say.\n\nVirtual machines?  Java and .NET, among others, run inside a sandbox.  This is good for portability and stability, buy denies access to the OS; you get what the sandbox gives you.\n\nLast, but not exhaustively, libraries.  The standard libraries available to a language might dictate its use.  If what you want to do only has a library in C, you're either porting it to your favorite language, creating an interop wrapper for it, or writing in C.",

Most of them can do the task. It's just what you like.\n\nThink about C++ and Objective-C. Both were attempts to make C object-oriented. Did one stop when they heard about the other? Did C++ win because it was the best for the job? No, C++ won because it was part of AT&T which was a much bigger entity than the folks that developed Objective-C.\n\nIt's just like natural languages. Is English the best language? Some (who natively speak it) say yes, but it's only because they speak it. Others insist that their language is best. We could learn Esperanto which was a designed language where the ease of learning was a key objective. Yet, it's not popular because people love their own languages, and maybe ease of learning isn't that important. Some people love how complex their language is (or how many feature it has).\n\nTo get to your second question, there are languages that try to avoid using null, so they have to create Option types (that's one way to do it). This creates a level of mental overhead that those who have never used those types find unimportant, yet others, who think null pointer exceptions are evil and the cause of many errors feel it's justified.\n\nOr languages that want to be pure functional have problems with I/O, such as printing, and have to use complex math structures like monads, when everyone else feels printing is really easy, but it's counter to the functional philosophy.\n\nProlog was built to have a backtracking mechanism, and for most, it looks like nothing you'd expect and is hard to get your mind around, and because of that, hard to figure out. Erlang, which was inspired by Prolog, has a syntax that's hard for those used to C-style syntax (which is most popular languages) to understand, partly because it was designed before language designers decided languages should look like C.\n\nAnd was that because C was a great language? No, but it was hugely popular in industry, so to design languages that looked like C was considered beneficial because people were more likely to try out your language if they didn't have to struggle with the syntax as much.\n\nFunctional languages don't like having state, so they don't have plain old for-loops because the looping variables change values. So, they use functions like: fold, map, filter, zip, etc. to achieve looping capabilities without a looping variable. They also rely a lot on recursion.\n\nIt helps if you try these other languages like learning Prolog or Erlang or Haskell to see how different they are.",

These roles are always undervalued and under represented in big team projects in university and schools. Some people might partake in this role, but usually the team doesn’t take the role seriously. But that is usually the way it is with product managers - they have to make themselves useful, so that the team can see the purpose in the role.\n\nEven though you can’t code, I’m sure that’s a lot of things that you’ve caught on about - use that knowledge to support the team in every possible way. Communication is key - as it is in any successful endeavor.\n\nBut you won’t learn enough in a month  - it is simply not enough time.\n\nBut if you do choose to study hard and try to make lost time, here’s a few suggestion for you:\n\nStop focusing on fancy called examples or guides from people that tell you that this kind of projects will get you jobs - find something that is within your scope of capabilities; even if this means this is simply a small blogging website or a simple web crawler or even a calculator. Finish that project - and do not use AI tools to complete it.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. AI tools are extremely powerful and in the industry we use them daily.

Displayed them\n* Break for lunch\n* Google `how to catch mouse clicks`\n* Click away happily for a few minutes\n* Use some advanced math (uh, division and modulo) to convert a point on the screen to an element of the 2D array\n* Change the code to say \"You clicked square x, y, which contains a blue blob\"\n* Use my advanced CS degree to do find all the blobs of the same color connected to this blob (flood fill)\n* etc\n\nI can go on for a lot longer, but I hope I've made the point. If I had asked AI to do the whole thing then I would have learned nothing. However, I did most of the work myself and only searched on the intertubes for the *specific* things I didn't know how to do.",

Do not be scared of struggle, it is literally learning. Once you break code and you fix and you tweak, that's how you learn. The best way to get out of that loop it is to accept that you will hate it, you will struggle, you will not enjoy the learning process all the time. But you have to accept it because it is part of learning. So, pick whatever technology you have to learn and stick with it. Do a tutorial, code with the tutorial, then try building something without the tutorial, if you get stuck research or go back to the tutorial and repeat. You will learn through projects and through doing, repetition and practice is what will help u not forget. Again, don't be scared of struggle.",

I've had similar experiences with courses where the instructor seems to contradict themselves, and it definitely slows things down.\n\nFrom my own experience, I'd suggest a couple of resources that are great for getting a solid foundation in PHP:\n\nThe official PHP Manual (PHP.net): It can be a bit dry, but it's the absolute source of truth. Whenever I was stuck on what a function did or the right way to write something, I'd go there. It's less a tutorial and more of a reference, but it's essential.\n\nfreeCodeCamp: They have a full, comprehensive PHP course on YouTube that is completely free. It's well-structured and a fantastic alternative to a confusing paid course.\n\nAs for how long it takes, everyone's different. My biggest piece of advice, based on my own journey, is don't get lost in a forest of theory and code at the start.\n\nJust learn the absolute basics—variables, loops, etc.—and then immediately start doing. Try to build something super simple. A huge help for me was using an AI assistant. You can literally tell it, \"Explain this to me like I'm a child,\" and it will break down complex concepts into really simple terms. Use it to guide you as you build your first small project.\n\nOnce you have some hands-on experience and things start to click, then go back and learn the deeper theory. It'll make so much more sense because you'll have actual context for it.\n\nYou got this, good luck",

I'll answer them separately:\n\n>is it necessary to read ~~all of~~ the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?\n\nI'd lean on the side of yes. Reason being - each language has it's idiosyncracies/hidden gotchas/pitfalls. Most (if not all) of these are usually spelt out in the docs. In fact, several questions people ask on reddit/stackoverflow have their answers lying partially or wholly in the docs.\n\nThat being said, there are caveats to how much of the docs one needs to read. I've added some context around this further below.\n\n>is it necessary to read ALL OF the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?\n\nNo. It's recommended, but not necessary to read ALL of the documentation.  My personal opinion is that you should only read the docs for things you're explicitly working with (though it's always good to go above and beyond).\n\n>I ask because documentation often contains a lot of specifications and information that can be overwhelming. I have been advised to read the \"reference manuals\" first, but even that is difficult.\n\nI feel you. Docs can be overwhelming especially if you're just starting out / are not familiar with the language. Here's how I do it (may or may not work for you) - I tend to generally only give docs a very surface level read/ avoid them until I'm fairly well versed with the language. Then - once I start doing more complex stuff - I tend to simply use my IDE to read docs for specific things I'm working with.\n\nE.g. in Java, if I'm using a class from the core library, I can hit F12 in my IDE to go to the class's source code and read the doc comments directly within that class.\n\nI find that this compartmentalizes the doc information to only the specific pieces of info I need for my work. It's much less overwhelming to me that way. YMMV.",

Nope.\n\nWhile you certainly can, it may not be the best way to approach it.\n\nIve been learning since jan, ive been using udemy courses, yt vids, projects and docs. Nowhere could i find a methodology to go through the documentation to find something and honestly its kinda confusing especially with poorly written docs.\n\nWhat i have found to help is to start high level and zoom into specifics as you get a better idea of what to do. \n\nHeres a recent example from my side while building a crud app. \n\nI want to create and view a blog article so what do i do? \nAssuming the html forms and express server is already set up. Ok so i need to be able to firstly log the inputs, what does it look like, how do i do that, and if its not in a useable state, how do i transform it. Ok then i need to be able to access the json file and also somehow save to the json file. Ok then lastly to view the article i need to again access the json and somehow display the info somewhere in my html( or in my case ejs template). Again what would happen if the data is not in a useable state? \n\nThis breaks down all the steps which you can then go looking for your methods. So as an example (im using node and express for the backend) i want to access the json file. So you can google that and read around or go straight to the docs (if you know roughly which module) and then look for various ways to read a json file. And then when you find, ok so in the fs module i have a few methods to choose from, .read().readFile().createReadStream(), so among these methods which one is applicable to my situation. Now you're reading the docs, looking at specifics, comparing methods with a specific goal in mind. You can even test each one to see if it works or not. \n\nI have found this to work for me... And yes its very time intensive as compared to just getting the code from AI in 30sec. \n\nLike i said, im still learning, but im keen to hear your opinions and any more seasoned professionals on how they approach docs. Its something that doesn't get explained on how to navigate and find what you need.",

The problem you need to solve is _text processing and XML handling_, but what you're asking about is _fully understanding Python_. These are two different things.\n\nPython as a language lets you be productive with only a small understanding of the language itself (that's how I got started with it; I've actually forgotten how or when I started writing Python, at some point I realised that's what I was writing my scripts in, rather than Perl or Bash).\n\nIn programming, as elsewhere, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. The stuff you write with only a minimal understanding of Python will look awkward to someone more experienced, including yourself some few months from now.\n\nGenerally what you want is:\n\n1. a _good enough_ understanding of the language semantics itself. \"Good enough\" is poorly defined, and varies by language:\n  * A language like Rust will require more investment in learning up front, but deliver very few gotchas down the line\n  * A language like Javascript or PHP will require very little investment in learning up front, but deliver more gotchas down the line\n  * Python is kinda more middle-of-the-road.\n  * For this bit you kinda just gotta read a book, preferably a good one so you don't fall asleep, and do some exercises to get a feel for it.\n1. A decent understanding of engineering in the language, as in, how do you write long-term maintainable code?\n  * This includes which libraries and external tools you're expected to use.\n  * For Python you kinda have to check /r/Python and other resources, but currently Astral tools like `uv` and `ruff` are good to have in your toolkit, and a typechecker like Microsoft's `pyright` until Astral's `ty` gets to 1.0.\n  * Static analysis, both typechecking and linters, will help you catch weaknesses in your understanding of what you're doing.\n1. A decent ability to discover relevant information in documentation, especially reading API docs.\n  * Generally searching is better than trying to memorize everything. Your brain can only fit so much information.\n  * Language servers / IDEs can help a lot with discoverability.",

That can come later once you actually develop the app, and shouldn't have much bearing on how the app is developed. \n\nWebb apps have 3 main components. A backend of some sort (usually some kind of API that serves JSON, but depending on your design it might also serve fully rendered HTML), a database that stores persistent data (user info, product info, user content, etc) that your backend interacts with, and a frontend that consists of HTML, JS, and CSS (this frontend may be served by the same backend discussed before or could be served by a different service. Doesn't really matter for development.\n\nSo how do you pick what to use? You'll get tons of answers. One answer could be that you should use whatever your team currently uses. Another might be that you have really specific performance requirements that demand a certain stack. \n\nFor you, the answer is \"whatever you want\". Really. I would look up some common stacks that maybe use languages you're already familiar with and then just pick one and go with a getting started guide. \n\nLike javascript a lot? Use MERN. More of a Python guy? Use Flask or Fast API and pick either Vue or React for the frontend. Want to learn more vanilla javascript and not bother with frameworks? Cool. You don't need React or Vue or any other framework. \n\nFor other tools, make sure you're comfortable with git, github, working in bash or zsh or some other *nix shell.

Even if the database in question uses some other query language (Neo4j uses a special language to query graphs called Cypher, Mongo uses a specially crafted JSONs, etc) the ideas for data selection and aggregation are often transferrable between them. So, doing good at SQL will open doors to data science, business analysis, database performance work, and in general will make you more valuable for every developer team in the future.\n\nAnother one such \"language\" is regular expressions. Python may not be a good language to learn and use them because AFAIK it lacks special syntax support for them, but Ruby, Rust, JavaScript have better syntax for them. Learning regexes *well* will help you work with unstructured data, extract data form text, logs, do data migration between systems, and do quick changes to text files including some advanced search-and-replace operations in your code editor. It's a very good supplemental skill to have.\n\nLearning Shell scripting is my third recommendation. Learning how to combine programs together, build pipelines, learning SSH tunneling - all of this will be useful over decades, too.\n\nA large pert of programmer's work is spent outside of their primary language, so getting comfortable with the world besides `if`s and `for`s is always a good idea.",

Consider “gathering requirements” this in itself is some documentation you want to create before you start developing. You probably also want to pin down any quality attributes and relevant SLO/SLAs, and a workable architecture or design for your software. Basically you start by producing a pile of documentation that you reference throughout your development, and while developing you may produce documentation about certain methods or functions, or a quirk of a third party system you interact with, and so on, which will help the future developers (likely you) maintain the project. You’ll also want “user facing documentation” that the people who use the software you produce can use to help them get the most out of it or answer questions for them when they stumble across a workflow quirk.\n\nFurther I consider the value of a SWE to not just be code output, but “knowledge output”, so alongside development or while making architectural decisions or soliciting requirements, or after getting user feedback, they should also be learning things about the domain and ideally producing some documentation that can help the whole team understand the why and how behind certain domain-specific things. Code is almost inherently technical debt, and knowledge is the only thing that lets you pay it down.\n\nIt sounds like a lot, but all of it can usually fit in an agile sprint or whatever. And to some extent it depends on what level of developer you are, Jr. dev will likely not be getting customer requirements, setting quality attributes and SLOs, nor drafting architecture. However, a Jr. dev will likely be expected to write some unit documentation for the code they create, and may be expected to write user-facing documentation for the feature they implement.",

That's a long time in a tough market.\n\nHere's what I'd consider.. Instead of completely switching, maybe add React or Vue to your JS skills? That way you're building on what you know rather than starting over. PHP backends with modern JS frontends is a killer combo that lots of companies want.\n\nThe Spring Boot frustration you felt is totally normal.. Java web dev has a steep learning curve compared to Laravel's elegance. Most Java courses do start way too basic which is annoying when you already know how to code.\n\nIf you really want to explore Java, maybe try building a simple REST API first instead of jumping into Thymeleaf. But honestly? I'd probably spend that 6 months getting really good at Laravel and a modern JS framework. The ROI might be better and you're not starting from scratch.",

A service must be designed with the intent to be runnable in multiple instances for it to be considered horizontally scalable, not all applications meet these criteria, and once they meet them, other services they depend on (e.g. databases, queues, weird disk based sharing) must also be able to meet demand, or else the service will just bottleneck outside of its control.\n\nResilience can be broken down into three categories, what happens when  the service breaks, what happens when the services around it break, and what happens when the service is used incorrectly - all three must be covered for it to be resilient, and cloud helps with none of these.\n\nWhat you probably have in mind is *availability,* which yes, load balancing a service which supports it in the cloud, whether automatically or manually, does to an extent solve availability (*to an extent is doing a lot of heavy lifting here).* This is what happens when *one or more* instances of your service are no longer available.\n\nSecurity is not only authorization and authentication, but also what information I can receive from your system while being a legitimate user, whether I can abuse timing, delays, your concurrency model, false requests, rollbacks and a thousand other things.\n\nHowever, most job postings don't really mean all this, it's just a fun thing to write these days.",

Usually vertical scaling isn't an issue for us, we use Django and Celery and they run on separate instances to reduce load on the main API server, for that we use RabbitMQ in the mix. I can't remember the lats we needed to tweak a box specification. We run everything via ECR/ECS, the AWS Docker solution.\n\n**Performant**: Well to some extent this goes back to initial software design, choosing the most efficient algorithms, libraries and your own data structures. For example, me being an big fan of Lisp, Haskel etc I tend to use \\`deque\\` instead of the stock Python list as it handles certain types of insertions fast that the List, then you can hand it back as  a list() if you want later.\n\n[https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)\n\n**Secure**: We use at rest encryption for our RDS instances, plus certain data models have custom load and save to perform encryption prior to sending fields to the database for double protection, using the SECRET\\_KEY value.\n\nAlso, we use asymmetric encryption on the JWT token, using the AWS Parameter Store to manage all keys, our environment configurations, TaskDefinitions etc are all setup to reference the keys so that they are available to Django at runtime through a simple AWS API call, and some are pushed into the running environment as we use \\`decouple.config()\\` quite a lot as well.\n\nSo, that's what we do!",

The platform can do it, no stress, but whether the app can handle it is up to the app. If you slap an old stateful app into kubernetes and make more replicas of it, you're pretty likely to get bad behaviour, as in erroneous responses or crashes.\n\nWe had high availability designs for apps before cloud providers, they were just a bit more of a PITA to get the other replicas for.\n\nOne guide to getting there is the [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/). The guide might look a bit weird to those of us who think those are just normal apps, and work with gitops and distroless containers on a daily basis.\n\n> And would using the cloud platform's built-in authentication and authorization services be enough to ensure security?\n\nYeah, nah. You can still leak your credentials and do lots of stupid shit. Vibe coders do it all the time. You need to have some idea of what authn and authz means, _why_ you do it, and which bits of information can go where. If you think the cloud services provide all the security you need and then push sensitive information out to any client, you've fucked up.\n\nSecurity is also something of an eternal cat-and-mouse game. Like some algorithms need to pretend to be slow just to limit their vulnerability to timing attacks. Security is an entire rabbit hole of its own.\n\n> I also see job postings that want experience designing \"performant\" software. Aren't you always trying to make code as efficient as possible? What is performant software and how would software not be performant?\n\nSoftware is non-performant for a whole host of reasons, and getting it to be performant isn't just one thing. One thing is bad [big-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), but people also do stuff like bad structuring of network calls, and to some extent choosing the wrong language (program design usually matters a lot more than language choice).",

Then expose the Pi server to the internet however, e.g. using Cloudflare.\n\nFor a more robust setup, I'd go with an ESP32 (capable of deep sleep when idle) to read the button, which sends a notification to a backend API server, which updates a separate static web server.

        "body": "I'm going to disagree with the other two posters a *bit*, and post my own definition. Firstly, you absolutely, 100% should learn classes. They are used everywhere in every facet of programming, *including* Frontend Dev. Modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Lit, etc. use them, so they're absolutely necessary to have at least a basic grasp of.\n\nI'd also disagree that the \"description of an object is called a CLASS\". This is like...90% accurate, but there's a small bit of distinction that I think is important.\n\n# Classes and Objects\n\nFirstly, let's define what the word \"object\" means. I like to think of an object in programming as a *noun*; it's a \"thing\". It has can have some **adjectives** that describe it (it's \"old\" or \"blue\") and it can have some **verbs** that it can do (it can \"drive\" or \"honk\"). It's also got a name usually that describes it (so we can refer to that \"thing\"), and often times we can say that it's a particular **kind** of thing. \n\nNow, instead of using the words \"adjective\", \"verb\", and \"kind\", let's replace those with more programmy words:\n - `property`: properties are the adjectives. They describe something about the object. Some of those properties can be changed (I may get taller or shorter as I age); other properties cannot change (I will always have been born in my hometown; that cannot change). Generally speaking, properties don't \"do\" anything; they're just descriptors. Each property has a \"key\" (what it is) and a value. For example, our car has a property with key \"color\" and value \"blue\".\n - `method`: Methods are the verbs, and they usually have a pair of parentheses somewhere in their name. I can `program()`. I can `write(message)` (write a message). I cannot `fly()` (that's not one of my methods!).\n - `class`: The class of an object is, roughly speaking, its _type_. I am a human (my class is Human). The `old`, `blue` thing that can `drive()` is an object of type `Car`. All objects of a particular type are defined as having certain methods and properties. Classes can also be thought of as \"templates\" for objects. I want an object that fits the template \"car\" (i.e., does things a car can do), so I'll use the Car class.\n\nHere's an example of a class in JavaScript:\n\n```\nclass Car {\n  constructor(color, age){\n    //roughly speaking here, `this` refers to the object we're talking about.\n    this.color = color;\n    this.age = age;\n  }\n\n  drive() {\n    alert('vroooom!');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd to use this class, I'd do something like this:\n\n```\nconst myCar = new Car('blue', 'old');\n\nconsole.log(myCar.color);//'blue'\n```\n\nSo why would I disagree that the description of an object is a class? Well, in describing that old blue car, I'd... well I'd describe it exactly that. An old, blue car. _However_, the adjectives \"old\" and \"blue\" are _not part of the class_! Instead, they're values (see above). Instead, a class describes a _template_ for an object, not that actual, specific object. Every person alive has an `age` property and a `placeOfBirth` property, but mine is almost certainly different from, say, yours. \n\n# Why\n\nClasses allow us to organize our data in a paradigm of programming known as Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It's not the _only_ paradigm, but it's a pretty popular one. Classes:\n - Allow us to define a particular behavior _once_ and then reuse that behavior\n - Can be \"extended\". For example, I might have a `Pet` class with properties like `hungerLevel` or methods like `makeSound()`, and then I might \"extend\" that class with something like a `Dog` class (with a `bark()` method), or a `Fish` class (with a `splash()` method). Again, this allows us to define certain, common behaviors only once!\n\nThe first point is particular important. Imagine if every time a person signed up for FaceBook, a team of programmers had to write functions to deal with that person's account. Oh, /u/Maleficent_Speech289 signed up? We'll need to write a `login()` and `getPictures()` and `postMessage()` method for them! Instead, with classes, you can just say: \n\n```\nconst someUser = new User('Maleficent_Speech289');\nsomeUser.getPictures(); //this behavior is already defined, so we can just use it!\n```\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nYou absolutely, 100% need to know classes as a programmer. It doesn't matter if you're new, senior, or somewhere in between; you'll need to know them at some point, and it's never too early to start learning them. Anyone that hires you will expect you to have clean, structured code, and while there are other programming paradigms, OOP is one of the most popular to the point that it's kinda a \"default\".",

        "body": "In JS, a class, aka object, is not really an object, it is ***a prototype ***  This difference was emphasized in many older books but has been forgotten since around 2012.   The last book I know of that adheres to this differentiation though the author did not explain the difference at all was the book Javascript the Good Parts by Douglas Crawford.  \n\nYou should think of a prototype as a ***generalized object/class***, it is a ***meta-class*** so to speak.   This was something discussed in a very old book called The Art of the Metaobject Protocol by Gregor Kiczales.   \n\nA typical object is very easy to understand as others have no doubt explained to you already.  It is basically a list of data and a list of methods that operates on those data and those data only.   You can create a new type of object from an existing object by inheriting all of its data and methods + nee ones you specified.  You should think in your mind as a circle engulfed by a bigger circle where the smaller circle is the old and the big circle now containing the smaller circle is the new.  \n\nThis is pretty much all you can do with objects if JS were really an object-oriented language like Java -- I wrote some stuff bashing Java the other day, people interested should search for the keyword Scratch in my comment history.  I basically argued why Scratch is better than Java, but that's just a click-bait title.  \n\nWith prototype, the relationship between the old and the new is not a circle in a circle but two circles connected by a line.  Yep, that's it.  We are done.\n\nTo truly appreciate the difference, you have to ask what happens during the ***construction of a new new-object***.  In the circle-in-circle model, you simply get another circle-in-circle.  \n\nHowever in JS, creating another circle-line-circle new-object can be done in ***two ways***, hence all the weird constructors in JS.  When you use the keyword 'class' you are creating a brand new circle-line-circle.  This is the standard method since ECMA6.  However there is an older method using the keyword 'new\".  \n\nWith 'new', you do not get another circle-line-circle, you get a new circle attached to the existing circle-line-circle, and the relationship is a triangle.  The you have circle-line-Circle-line-circle where Circle represents the old-object and the two 'circle's are the created new-objects. \n\nWhy does this matter?  This means both child (new-objects) share the same parent.  And either one can ***modify the parent's data or add new methods to the parent*** and that information will be propagated to the other child.  This is an important feature because it means you can modify the parent ***at run time.***  You can use this for all sorts of purposes.  \n\nIt would take too long to explain all the things you can do with this, just consult the book I mentioned or use your imagination.  \n\nI do want to mention something that is not in the book and I do not believe it is implemented anywhere.  In JS at least you can do it pretty easily.   Imagine now you go to the new 'class' constructor and you use that to create another circle-line-Circle-line-cicrle, now you have two families of the same objects, but they can follow different ***dynamic*** paths during program run time to become something else entirely.  One obvious application would be for games where you have different creatures from different families but as they evolve, they can split off from the main tree.  But, it can even go back through its ancestor tree and start ***rewriting history.***\n\nAnyway, this is long enough.\n\ne:  JS was originally derived from Scheme and the book was written for LISP based language which is the root of Scheme.  The creator of JS wanted to create a Scheme language to be used as the scripting language for the then best browser Netscape.  However, Java had just taken off and was seen as the future of the programming world.  So the investors of Netscape insisted on a ***java-like*** language thinking it would make JS compatible with Java in the future.  \n\nObviously you should never let non-tech people make tech decisions.  So the JS creator took the matter into his own hand and created a ***java-look-alike***.  It looks like Java but it has nothing to do with Java, it is way better because it runs on Scheme under the hood.   Yes, that's all it is.  He took a Scheme engine and created a cosmetic layer over it.  This was how he created JS in 3 days.   And God took 7 days to create the Universe.  Not too shabby.",

If you only use that minimal set of features then you ensure maximum compatibility - your script will run on any POSIX compliant shell.\n\nHowever, sometimes those minimal features are restrictive. Sometimes you care less about compatibility with other systems and more about having access to additional functionality like arrays. In this case it makes sense to use a shell that goes beyond basic POSIX functionality like Bash.\n\nThat's really all there is to it. It's a tradeoff between functionality and compatibility.",

If you’re using excessive network and memory to do something simple like get max, min, avg, etc., then try writing it in SQL so the database only has to send you the data you actually care about.

On the other hand, M4 Macs are already on ARMv9, which is pretty similar to ARMv8 as far as unprivileged code is concerned but significantly different for privileged code as many system registers were added, changed, and removed since ARMv8, plus the M4 in particular also has 512-bit Scalable Matrix Extension support, so depending on what you want to do, that may or may not be appealing to you.\n\nGeneral purpose AArch32 and AArch64 HTML documentation:\n\n* [ARMv6M, ARMv7, and ARMv8 assembly reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/latest/);\n* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 instruction set architecture](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/latest/)\n* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 system registers](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0601/latest/)\n\nDocumentation specific to the SoCs used by the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 and their derivatives:\n\n* [Cortex A72 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100095/latest/)\n* [Cortex A76 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100798/latest/);\n* [ Generic Interrupt Controller core reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0471/latest/);\n* [Generic Interrupt Controller v2 specific reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0048/latest/);\n* [PrimeCell 0111 UART](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0183/latest/);\n* [BCM2711 datasheet (Pi 4)](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/bcm2711/bcm2711-peripherals.pdf).\n\nOther resources:\n\n* [Bare-metal section of the Raspberry Pi forums (I help there sometimes under the same name as my reddit account)](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewforum.php?f=72&sid=de4c2c97b2b1372281ef64d6aed3dc5f);\n* [Tutorial that got my feet wet on AArch64 (I already had experience with AArch32 from decades ago)](https://www.rpi4os.com/);\n* [Rust HDMI audio driver that I made for the Pi 4 and 5](https://github.com/CodexTextor/rpi-hdmi) (will not work on the BCM2712 D0 stepping SoC used on models of the Pi 5 introduced after I wrote that code because the physical addresses of the hardware are different).\n\nNote that there's no public official documentation for the BCM2712 SoCs of the Raspberry Pi 5, so all my code targeting that platform is based on my own reverse-engineering research effort that included reading the official Linux driver code from Broadcom, messing around with hardware registers on Linux to figure out how they work with a proper driver, and deriving knowledge from my experience with and available documentation for the BCM2711 SoC of the Pi 4, since there was very little community work done on this front when I got my first Pi 5. If you go the Raspberry Pi route I also recommend getting the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe, installing OpenOCD, and reading [this thread](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=362067) on the Raspberry Pi forums for the OpenOCD script.\n\nAs for setting up the environment for native development on macOS, you don't really need much beyond Xcode's command-line tools, which you can install by typing:\n\n    xcode-select --install\n\nAnd then following the on-screen instructions.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Added Xcode command-line suggestion.",

For each match, it checks whether the substring of `s2` starting at that point actually equals `s1`\n\nThe trick is that instead of those steps being implemented directly as loops, they're implemented by calling methods on `std::char_traits<char>`, which in turn call the standard C library functions `memchr` and `memcmp`, respectively.\n\nAnd depending on the platform, those functions in turn can be implemented using highly-optimized assembly code, which is likely faster than anything you would write by hand in C++.  For instance, on x86_64 Linux with glibc, `memchr` has various different implementations using SSE2, AVX2 or EVEX SIMD instructions, depending on which CPU features are detected at runtime.",

Steve wrote the entire program in 6502 Assembly - on paper - then hand-translated everything in the numeric machine code that then could be loaded on the Apple computers. You can find plenty information on how Steve did it on the internet.\n\nWhen I learnt 8051 Assembly in my degree program we initially also learnt to hand-translate the Mnemonics into machine code and vice versa. Can highly recommend to learn that with simpler CPUs, like the 6502, the Zilog Z-80, or the 8051/8031/8080 series Microcontrollers.\n\nAssembly is just a 1:1 translation of machine code and therefore is closest to hardware.",

Node.js with Express is way easier to pick up when you already know JavaScript, and you can focus on learning backend concepts without learning a whole new language at the same time.\n\nAt Metana we actually see this transition a lot. Frontend devs wanting to go full stack. Most find it easier to stick with JavaScript ecosystem first (Node/Express) then maybe explore Java later if needed. But if your project specifically needs Spring Boot or you're targeting Java jobs, then go for it.\n\nEither way, the key is building that project while you learn. Don't just do tutorials tho. Actually build your backend API as you go through the course material. You'll learn way faster that way.",

The rise in AI-generated content has blurred the lines of authenticity in online discussions. Here are a few reasons why it might *feel* like that:\n\n# 🧠 Why Posts Might Feel AI-Generated\n\n1. **Overly Polished Language** Posts are increasingly written in this weirdly structured, “essay-like” format. People don’t usually talk like that on Reddit — especially in tech circles where tone tends to be blunt, sarcastic, or informal.\n2. **Generic Advice & Vague Details** A lot of posts give surface-level advice or talk about issues in super broad terms without getting into the gritty technical details — which is common with AI output unless prompted very specifically.\n3. **Repetitive Phrasing and Templates** You’ll often see similar turns of phrase or story structures across different posts — things like “After X years in the industry, I realized Y” or “Am I the only one who feels Z?” It starts to feel formulaic.\n4. **Influx of Low-Effort Engagement Farming** Some users (or bots) are using AI to mass-generate posts and comments to farm karma, drive traffic, or build fake authority on niche topics.\n\n# 🤖 Signs a Post Might Be AI-Generated\n\n* Lacks personal anecdotes or uses generic placeholders.\n* Echoes common sentiments without adding anything new.\n* Oddly balanced tone: too formal but pretending to be casual, lol.\n* Uncanny ability to sit on the fence on controversial topics.\n* Unnatural use of 💩 emojis.\n* Overuse of the em dash (—).\n\n# 🧩 You're Not \"Schizo\" — You're Perceptive\n\nIt’s unsettling, yeah. And it *does* erode trust — not just in content, but in online community culture itself. Part of Reddit’s value used to be real, lived experience and human nuance. If that’s being diluted, it makes total sense to question what you're reading and who's actually behind it.\n\nIf you're feeling disoriented by all this, it’s not paranoia — it’s pattern recognition. You’re seeing a shift, and you’re trying to make sense of it. That’s a sane reaction.\n\nWant to talk about how to filter for more authentic content or spot AI in the wild?",

You could feel that every single crypto asset is bullshit, but even then I’m not sure you could deny that selling services to people who want to use and trade those assets isn’t a real business. I think Pokémon card investing is bullshit, but if someone built a website to facilitate buying and selling of cards and took in real revenue, I’d still call that a real business. And all of those trading venues and lending venues need developers, often to build rather complex products that can’t have much downtime.\n\nAn area that’s bigger than ever are stablecoins - crypto assets pegged to (generally) the US dollar. The companies that offer these digital assets hold things like US treasuries to back them, so the company can earn revenue off of the interest while also ensuring that each digital dollar can be redeemed for a US dollar. As far as crypto things go, these are probably the most useful. People in countries with volatile currencies and poor banking systems can now receive, hold, send, and earn interest on US dollars with just a phone and an internet connection. They can send them anywhere in the world and be paid from anywhere in the world. And with the crap going on with Steam and itch.io having to block NSFW games because of pressure from credit card companies, I’d argue we actually could really use a digital dollar that’s as free flowing and censorship resistant as a real life physical dollar. And all of the software that runs this, as well as the apps people use to engage with it, require software devs.\n\nSo they’re either doing that, or trying to pump out another meme coin. It’s a pretty harsh dichotomy imo.",

Take credit for your work\n\nYou can't rely on other people doing it for you and it's by far the biggest mistake people make early in their careers. Keep a log of every win you've had - everything you've delivered, any example of you doing more than expected, every piece of positive feedback you've gotten. You should have a \"brag\" document, and religiously populate it.\n\n2. Be aggressive about taking on work that is worth taking credit for, and avoiding (as much as possible) to do work that isn't worth taking credit for\n\nAsk for the visible project. Show you're good, and then use that to buy yourself the entry to the projects that will make you look good. If you get signed up for a project that sucks, do what you can to get moved out of that project, or to do as little for that project as possible. \n\nNow, this becomes much easier to do if you're really good at your job, but even if you're not - sometimes the squeaky wheel gets the grease.\n\n3. Prove to be more valuable than you are a hassle\n\nWhat's interesting is that this is much more important advice in general for tech people than it is for how it specifically relates to foreign labor. Real talk: a lot of tech people are fucking miserable to work with. Be pleasent to work with. Be open minded. Be available. Be polite. Be punctual. \n\nYes, if you're really good at your job you can get away with being a complete asshole. I've met like 2 such people in my career. I've met *dozens* who *thought* they were that dude, and it very much limited their careers because they did not understand that they were just not smart enough to get away with being such huge jerks.",

In between questions I faintly but surely hear a completely different dude feeding answers. We kill the interview early.",

I'll hit em back with a \"Aight, I'm tied up right now. Get started on debugging, I'll sync up with you later\". This then very explicitly creates the expectation that they need to take a stab at it before we sync up.\n\nI find more often than not, if I invent a little bit of space, people manage to figure out their issues by themselves, or at least get further along and try various things.\n\nInstant gratification, and spoonfeeding people answers, is what cultivates this kind of culture where at the first sign of any sort of issue you immediately go to Person X. And when you've cultivated a culture like that.... why wouldn't they? Why in the world would I read through logs, find the error, google that error, and spend time figuring out what's wrong and how to fix it? There's no need for me to do that if I can send a message to Person X and get an answer dropped in my lap.\n\nNot everyone is coachable that way, and that way isn't an instant-fix either. It takes a lot of time. Way more time than if I just kept doing it myself and sending them answers. But I have significantly improved my work life when I've landed on teams with people like this by slowly but surely coaching them to do things on their own without just abruptly telling them to pound sand.\n\nIt makes a great story for interviews when asked about mentorship as well.",

To users, it solved a deep, nagging problem perfectly, and they paid handsomely for it. The “product” itself? Three (3!) lines of assembler code. The point is that the value delivered always outweighs the elegance or depth of the implementation. ",

Does it mean I have made enough progress or that I haven't?\"\n\nI will also say - as a reminder, PIPs are about having the right proof for being able to fire someone for ~~cause~~ a valid reason (thanks comment below for the correction). Its basically saying \"we were very clear about what you needed to do, And you didn't do it so we're firing you\".\n\nIf they put you on a PIP and then they fire you even if you did everything they asked you to do, then they're opening themselves up to a lawsuit.\n\nSo I would maybe read up a bit on PIPs and also make sure that if things look shady (i.e., if you're actually doing good at your job but they're trying to fire you for cause when they should instead be laying you off), that you figure out what recourse you have.",

By far, the most common reason is that your manager didn't collect enough supporting data to support firing you, if you choose to sue.  For example, you should have gotten a written summary of every 1:1 with your manager since the PIP began. If not, they may want to allow for more time to get better documentation.\n\nYou don't need documentation to close the PIP without firing you.  All your manager has to say is \"u/linkthecat's performance has been acceptable and I want to close the PIP.\"  Boom, done.\n\nThe fact that it's extended most likely means that your manager still wants to get rid of you, but HR is blocking it.\n\nThere are chances that your manager said \"they seem to be improving, but I need more time\". This happens, but it's unusual, simply because PIPs are unpleasant for the manager and they're unlikely to want to extend them.  \n\nIt's also possible that they're waiting to get your replacement.  That happens, but it's less likely, simply because it's better to be a little short-handed than to keep a bad performer around.  Besides, if your performance is bad enough to warrant a PIP, you're probably not contributing much, anyway.",

Write down answers to the top 20-30 common ones (“tell me about yourself,” conflicts, mistakes, etc.).\n\n\\- For tech rounds, you don’t need to master everything. \\~100 leetcode mediums will carry you through most screens.

You cannot leave opportunities on the ground especially when they throw themselves at you. You can always outlast a bad manager or coworkers—one of the most important things when determining work satisfaction. You can’t always find a good opportunity to advance yourself. \n\nDevOps is close enough to what you’re already doing that you could transition back if you wanted to and it’s a step in the right direction if you decide you want to do more dev stuff. \n\nA potential issue is the lack of dedicated support structure or guidance regarding best practices, the future of your company ops, and career development. Certainly in your team, if not the org at large. Been there, done that. \n\nThat means your trajectory will be up to you to make or break. It’s hard to be a trailblazer, but the benefits can be huge. If you decide you need to go somewhere to do some learning in a year or two, it will be that much easier with the title under your belt. \n\nAs for being rusty with programming, I wouldn’t stress it too much. I’ve never held the title explicitly, but as a data engineer who has only worked at small companies, I’ve done a lot of ops stuff. Coding is an important tool but it’s not going to be the make or break issue. You’re managing other people’s software and writing simple middleware not building an in-house operations management tool (yet).",

At the time, I was absolutely against this because new hires, particularly jrs, are basically a time suck and I felt like I'd be putting in basically a lot of work for pretty much no return and I already was burnt out and didn't have a whole lot of time. \n\nThe intern ended up starting and he absolutely exceeded all expectations. I felt like I could give him a task and with only a little guidance, he would figure it out on his own get it done and was really quick to pick up on things. I also didn't have to explain things to him multiple times. He would complete things quickly and with the enthusiasm of someone still fresh in the field.\n\nDespite me never wanting an intern in the first place I ended up pushing to hire him after the internship ended and after he finished out his last semester in school. He is now with us full time and whenever raise time comes around, I'm asking my boss what if anything I can do to help him get a promotion/raise- the answer is usually nothing, but I want to keep him because he has proven himself to be super valuable to the team and I know that earlier on in your career is when you can make moves to other companies for the biggest jumps in your career.\n\n  \nI guess to me what made the difference was that, he learned/improved quickly and was fairly independent. I didn't have to spell out each and every little step like I would to a chatgpt prompt. He had his own mind and could think through things instead of just follow my step by step instructions.",

You're establishing professional boundaries and making it clear that your working hours are 9-5, M-F. You'll be working 100% of your working hours.\n\nI don't know how cutthrough the consulting scene is, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but that's the advice I normally give to people suffering burnout. People always think in extremes. \"Put up with being miserable working 12 hour days\" vs \"Quit without anything lined up\".\n\nIn reality there's usually a less extreme option: \"Enforce your professional boundaries, and work 8 hour days, regardless of what's going on around you with the project and management\". And immediately start job searching with all that extra time.\n\nThe thing about that approach is even if that ruffles feathers, they usually don't fire you right away. They'll heckle you about your performance, they might PIP you, they'll desperately start looking for your replacement, maybe the client will drop you... but all that often takes months. Firing you outright is a much larger impact to the project than letting you work \"normal\" 8 hour days until they hire and train your replacement. It'd be a stupid management decision to react prematurely.\n\nSo in that time before they fire you... you're job searching *and* collecting a paycheck instead of draining your savings. And the best part of that approach is if they do end up firing you before you line something else up, you're *exactly* where you were about to put yourself voluntarily: Unemployed.\n\nThat said, at the end of the day quitting without something lined up isn't the end of the world. It's a calculated risk and an expense. If you decide that's worth it, go for it. If even after reducing your workday to 8 hours you're still feeling miserable, then that's likely not going to help, so quitting ASAP may be the best option for you.\n\nI'm surprised you lasted 3+ years of 12+ hour days... I would've be gone in month 1. WLB is my #1 priority. I'm a 9-5 employee. If I'm ever at a company where that's not sufficient, I take the above advice.",

You hinted at it with the personal finance remark, but you didn’t explicitly say that overtime at consulting firms are often compensated (and often at a 1.x multiplier of regular hourly rate). From the company’s perspective, a billable hour is a billable hour, but overtime hours are expensive, so it’d be perfectly reasonable to work with your leadership chain to cut overtime and hire more people instead. If relying on overtime is widespread, you can probably even rally support from coworkers by getting everyone to complain to leadership simultaneously.\n\nThe time tracking thing doesn’t need to involve micromanaging. All they care about is for time to be plausably accounted for, you don’t need to annotate every tiny minute. Nobody has time to audit everyone’s time sheets anyways, so you can usually get away with just blocking the whole day with your client’s project.",

Things are fine for 6 months, then people learn the job and suddenly we're meant to be senior level. Managment complains because they let go or had the previous high experience staff leave. Everything is monitored and micromanaged. People leave. Repeat. \n\nAlso upper managers ime tend to neg their employees, they'll feed you praise first then neg you into thinking you can do more and more until you burn out then hire someone new thinking \"oh this new engineer will be just as good\" not realising it takes like 6-12 months to fully settle into a senior role even if you are a senior from a different company. \n\nEither way, in most cases it's time to run because they're looking to lay people off.",

Always got fantastic reviews, sales soared, everything golden. \n\nThen after COVID and work from home, my manager started riding me over every little thing. I had been given tons of independence up to that point because our sales were so great and because my manager honestly didn’t know exactly what it was I did. I built the entire position from scratch and my manager had no computer skills so digital marketing and data analytics were not something he could really check my work on. So as long as number went up, he let me be. \n\nI had 5 years of smooth sailing, loved the work, did a good job, etc. So it felt super out of left field when I started getting grief daily. Note that our online sales were better than ever and growing faster than ever too. The hassling got worse and worse until finally I was given an official disciplinary review for my poor performance. \n\nWanna know the craziest part? Remember how I was the ONLY employee under my manager, the one who built the entire department from scratch? Well, a week after I got that disciplinary review for poor performance, my manager won employee of the year because of his department’s outstanding performance. He got a big bonus lol. \n\nGot called in the next week for another disciplinary review where they tried to push me into a lower pay position (I already got paid well below market standard, like half) and I quit on the spot lol. Sent him all the data I had, updated all my contacts and consultants to email him going forward, sent him a text file with something like 80 or 90 usernames/passwords for the various tools, apps, etc I was handling, and just walked out. \n\nBut it’s not all bad. I got a call a year later and they were still trying to fill the position and wanted me to come back. Apparently they couldn’t find anyone who would do 3 jobs for shit pay. That was the perkiest “no” I’ve ever delivered.\n\nI don’t know the best solution in your case, but if possible you should try to get them to fire you. I was too disgusted to stay so I missed out on a lot of benefits. But that was the best decision for me. You gotta find the best solution for you. Best of luck!",

Calling her a bad boss, saying she's mean, toxic, bad at her job, unfair - all of that doesn't matter if HR doesn't think you can get them in trouble. But if they think that - were they to fire you - you might hit them with a lawsuit for wrongful termination and hostile work environment stuff?

Find non-profits, send out emails, see if he has any luck. By doing that, when the market gets better, he'll have a strong enough resume to apply. It'll also give him a sense of purpose for now.\n\nIf possible, he can also go to a college for 2 years, get a diploma in healthcare-related profession. Or join the military/police.

Add a career summary at the top of the resume that rounds out all of your experience and the skills that you picked up. I would then consolidate the skills section to just the important skills that are referenced in a job listing. \n2. Leave out the career gap. They can infer that from gaps between one job to another. \n3. I don't think the awards section is relevant personally. If you want to keep it for sentimental reasons then I'd suggest having it last. \n4. You have far too much job experience to still warrant having projects in my opinion. I'd remove them. \n5. Add more information on the jobs that you had. Simply listing the jobs is not enough. Explicitly mention the technologies and tools used and what projects you did. \n6. Languages is not necessary in my opinion. Most applications ask for this before you input your resume. But it could be different for you, If so, then it can be kept. But I'd make it a single line.\n\nAs for the job application, I prefer Indeed to LinkedIn personally and got my last job through there. Also I'd suggest applying on the company website whenever possible, companies have separate pipelines for applications and pay attention to the ones that come in through their website. I'd also say that don't just fire off the same resume hundreds of times. Tweak it slightly for every single job and ensure that it meets all of the minimum and most of the preferred qualifications. \n\nAlso, I somewhat disagree with what another user on here said, the goal of your resume nowadays is to pass the ATS, not talk to a live person. Your resume should obviously be in human readable format but it should be jam packed with enough key words from the job description to get a high enough match and pass the ATS. After passing the ATS, you just have to convince a real human to hire you... which is far easier than some automated check that fails damn near everyone.",

When I worked with the Japan team of everybody’s favorite rainforest themed company, there was some culture clash between the leadership principles and Japanese politeness. We are used to direct critical feedback, even to people older/above us, they really aren’t. \n\nAnyways, don’t do anything that makes you uncomfortable. You can always communicate your boundaries and if they aren’t respected, you have your answer. You can always steer conversations back to professional, proactively would be something like “hey I want to learn more let’s stick to xyz”, or be very direct and say “hey i’m a little uncomfortable getting so personal can we stick to professional conversations just in discord?”\n\nIn the future, don’t let relationships get more personal if you don’t want them to.

The compliments were crazy like, Ah you're angel, you're so smart, you're so handsome, etc etc. It was a LOT from different people and honestly I felt like a celebrity there.\n\nJapan has a heiarchy of age and mentorship. Japanese call this like a Senpai-Kouhai relationship.  Basically they view their job as an older person or mentor to guide you, treat you, and sort of mold you as best they can. It can be weird from a westerner perspective because work time is work time and there's no \"relationship\" besides training you. \n\nI personally wouldn't be alarmed by this behavior but I'd still maintain distance. A lot of these type of people are  fascinated with having foreign friends. it's largely a selfish relationship for them. I often felt like a token foreigner friend and many girls wanted to date me just for being a foreigner. I sense this guy is the same. The other part of this is that a lot of these people use you as a way to feel some sort of acceptance outside their own culture. Like, oh I have a foreign friend that accepts me, I'm cool out of my own normal societal circumstance. \n\nJust be polite and keep saying I can't do X or Y.

It should radically expand to look more like an apprentice system.",

What is complexity of accessing a hashmap, what is an interface, what is REST, what is ACID, what is an index and when do you use it, would you choose monolithic or microservices architecture for a startup?\n\n2nd round - live coding: TDD approach, language of my choice, editor of my choice, testing framework of my choice, AI disabled. Create a very simple bank account and a way to do a transaction between 2 accounts. Then make it work in a multithreaded environment.\n\n3rd round - still live coding but very pseudo-code stuff. Write very simple load balancer (no network stuff, just simple code no real integration), make it random, make it round Robin. Then few stuff about SQL, what is pessimistic locking, what is optimistic locking and how does it work, write SQL for it, show me how to use it. What is a transaction, a dead lock, etc..\n\n4th round - system design.. model a system that solves this simple X real problem found in our domain. Just a chat basically.\n\n\n1st round quickly filters out people who don't have basic knowledge\n\n2nd round verifies skills in OOP, TDD, multithreading (locks, dead lock, race conditions).\n\n3rd round again verifies skills in OOP (bit redundant tbh), but then goes into the DB and verifies that you actually know what is going on under the framework\n\n4th round verifies that you know more high-level architecture stuff.. message queues, redundancy, gateway/api/reverse-proxy, sharding... and that you can think bigger than just a few classes.\n\nI think these 4 rounds could be compressed in just 3 and be just as effective. Phone call was 15 minutes, the 3 rounds were a little more than 1 hour each. A total of roughly 5 hours that could be shortened to 3.5 or 4. I am very confident this process filters out 100% of the people who can't do the job. They verify all the skills needed to do the daily work that people apply every day. Perfect, imho. I don't get why it is so difficult for other companies to do the same.\n\nThis process is applied by a tech unicorn, so it definitely works at scale too..",

In addition to talking about what was involved in coding the dashboard, you should talk about things like: why your company wanted this dashboard built, how you worked with the design team to build your dashboard to their design spec, how you wrote unit/functional/e2e tests and UATed your dashboard prior to deploy, how you used feature flagging and log monitoring to ensure a successful deploy, and what business goals were accomplished after you successfully deployed your dashboard.

You’re drowning and the first thing to do is to give yourself some air. My suggestion would be to start by carving out some time for mental decompression every day - it can be something as simple as taking 15-20 mins everyday for a walk or workout or just sitting and staring out the window. But no phones, no emails, no bringing a family member along to make this time about them- this is your time to spend some time with yourself so that you can process your own emotions.\n\nNext, I’d focus on the positives of the situation. To me, it looks like things may not be as bad as they seem - to you it feels like everyone is weighing down on you, but in reality everyone is probably as stressed as you are and they are just passing that along to you, as they are to everyone. Second, no matter how bad it seems, it’s a temporary situation and it will change. It feels like the end of the world right now because you are in the eye of the storm, but it will pass. Have faith in that if it feels like everything else is failing.\n\nYour employability may also be better than you feel. Even if it’s a niche industry, I’m sure there are skills you have that are transferable, and there may be opportunities in places you haven’t looked, like sister industries and customers where they may not be doing exactly what you are doing but your expertise could be valuable. It might be worth reaching out to mentors in the industry to figure out your blind spots in terms of employability.\n\nHope it works out, and remember, this too shall pass",

It's mostly a lose-lose proposition for them at the point where you've already left and began work for their client. If the company also had some kind of non-solicitation agreement with your agency, that's not really _your_ problem.\n\nI was in a similar position to you and the non-solicitation clause did not prevent me from joining the client company (a global 500).

Account for that since this is a learning experience you will not be in an out in 40 hours. Dedicate this time to just learning what you dont know. Do your best not to get too frustrated with yourself if you don't understand something. Practice reading code. This is such a separate skill from writing code. Given that you are junior it may or may not be clear what things are learnable via self teaching and what things are specific to your job/team/company that you just wouldn't know if someone didn't tell you. I wasted a lot of time trying to deduce what was going on when a lot of my lack of understanding was about things I couldn't have possibly known and just needed someone to tell me.

Was it to see how well I would design a system or was it on whether I read a book?\n\nTo see if you can regurgitate what you memorized on Youtube. And be a good talker. Be able to convince the other side you know everything from ground up and you are a rock star. And sound super organized.\n\n>I've never considered idempotency or what a hash ring is or what golden invariants are. I've never thought about CAP theorem, just that available and consistent is good. Requirements get passed to us by product managers, we never make them from a 5 minute conversation with the BA or stakeholder.\n\nThis is what my friends (senior engineers) at Google told me.\n\n\"We just use Spanner for everything. For all practical purposes, Spanner is highly available, highly consistent (basically instant so the 'eventual' part is just theory for practical purposes), and infinite scale.\"\n\nSo ya... now, CAP theorem states that in a real world, we have to choose Availability or Consistency as first priority. And that is true. But generally the idea is if you are dealing with money especially in banks, then choose Consistency. Otherwise, basically all the time Availability is fine.\n\nIn the real world? Unless you work at Amazon/Google scale, you are going to use postgres/mysql anyways. And even at those big tech firms sql databases are used in many teams.\n\nAs for what kind of databases I worked over so far: postgresql, mysql, mongodb, cassandra\n\nAlmost all companies using MongoDB are using MongoDB for no reason than \"it's webscale\" meme. It's tech debt. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs)\n\nUse case for Cassandra/DynamoDb is niche overall.\n\nScale? Dude, sql databases have run the world forever. Credit cards before the days of DynamoDB worked everywhere around the world. Everyone was swiping left and right. Big banks hold records of swipes, withdrawals, deposits, etc globally. Those dumb Youtube videos during covid by these juniors trying to gain views about high writes == nosql (kind of true but whatever)? sql databases can when writes are properly batched in theory go over a million insert per second though in reality, let's say 10k insert per second. 10k insert per second is 10\\^5 \\* 10\\^5 sec a day = 10\\^10 inserts a day aka 10 billion rows a day.\n\nSchemaless? Unless you are dealing with e-commerce, fraud, machine learning, etc., you can shove in your metadata to JSONB on postgresql.\n\nACID vs BASE? DynamoDB supports ACID as well. You can have sql databases have BASE like properties. Especially mysql in which you can change engine.\n\nBiggest differences are really nosql databases tend to be LSM tree oriented while sql databases tend to be B tree oriented. But DynamoDB on its sort key is B tree oriented as well.\n\nSharding? SQL can have auto sharding. Though it is true in practice (this part I agree since I have not used auto sharding in my jobs) you do have to worry about sharding on SQL. But like what? A few days a year or two for the team once everythings set up? Ya, nonissue.\n\nIt's all a clownfest at this point with each databases trying to emulate parts of the other database as well.\n\n**System Design Interview crap made more sense back when hardware was limited. Nowadays, we can have Redis instance with over half a terrabyte RAM. Many times, we can just chug the entire useful parts of database to the whole Redis.**\n\n  \nNow caching? Lol wait till you learn DynamoDB handles that for you if you are willing to pay extra. DynamoDB comes with caching by a click of a button so you don't need to handle a separate Redis instance. Just pay more money to AWS. All these \"scale problems\" you see in system design interviews are basically being all solved by Cloud providers. Cloud providers are not stupid. AWS needs to make more money. Why not just add more features to address all the known system design workarounds of the past?",

Is that correlation perfect? Nope.

Has enough experience to even mention details that aren't on books (this is a lie again). Able to have the simplest design and depending on a certain nonfunctional requirement, comes up with a nontraditional simple idea that works.\n\nPrincipal = At this point you are basically god of the interview. You also consider costs as well. Can't make a single mistake. It's an extreme bar and one could argue is really luck based. There's a reason engineers at tech firms make 7 figures from here.\n\nThe whole idea is as you gain more 'experience' in the real world, the way you 'talk' changes. So it really is about communication.\n\nIn practice? It's a whole show of bull like Leetcode. Why? Because in an actual job unless one works in pre-seed A or seed A startup (not even then), the day to day job is going to be nothing like the system design interview. It's going to be like what you said. It's just another round to fake.\n\nPlus, if you talked about using DynamoDB for payment transactions half a decade ago, then depending on interviewer, you would have been rejected anyways. Same idea about once you calculate both read and write and determine you can for use case use postgresql for small schemaless values. It's really dumb so ya... very very very subjective.",

The other option is doing what Netflix often does and putting high preference towards those who were referred by internal professionals. That just opens up to nepotism at that point.\n\nDo we want to go back to \"how many manholes in New York\" and so forth which btw have all been solved (significantly easier to memorize. Do-able in days), completely irrelevant to the job, etc?\n\nExplicit IQ tests are illegal and so this interview format is the closest to check someone's puzzle matching abilities. \n\nAnd no one can know who is a better hire over another without seeing the individual at the actual job (on payroll) for at least over half a year.\n\nOutside many LC Hards (which is just bullshit and only there for filtering because of supply/demand), most LC Easy and Medium are things I would expect a competent junior could do with prep. The \"prep\" is known to everyone (as fair as possible) and scalable (an individual does not need to study per role per company). From there given there's finite time, I can also get someone's thought process and communication. And most importantly, pattern matching skills (which is honestly some of the most important skills on the actual job). Let alone LC at its fundamentals tests on the very basic concepts I would expect every CS grad should know like classes, hashmap, set, bfs/dfs, stack/queue. On an ideal interview even if the candidate cannot think of the solution, the candidate should be able to work with the interviewer to the solution (indirectly shows how adaptable the candidate is to the actual workers there).\n\nFortunately, very very few firms give actual LC \"Hards\" directly w/o help. And those that do give the well known handful of LC Hards that can be studied for. If you are applying to Uber and Uber pays a massive paycheck, then of course you should expect artificially high standards because everyone's applying but there's only a few positions available. Most firms to this day especially nontech give LC Easy or Easy Medium. Something as simple as checking if a string is a palindrome or if the paranthesis are valid.\n\nSome companies do take home assignments on top as a byproduct. But the problem with take home is individuals have to code in a language they are not comfortable with and spend many hours (because other candidates will put in many hours regardless of what the expectation claims). But the reject from the hiring side is decided in seconds or minutes at most. It's extremely unfair from the candidate side. \n\nSo ya... It's process of rational elimination. There's no other scalable option today that this field has.\n\nOne could argue we should have some standardized test that gives out a score like the SAT. Well... that's basically what codesignal is nowadays.",

To do that, you’ll need to secure work authorization. As a Canadian, you qualify for a TN visa which would allow you to work in the U.S.\n\nYou will most likely not be able to do what you’re suggesting, that is only go into the office only 1 day a week. To keep your work permit active, you must be U.S resident for tax purposes. And to do this, you’ll have to meet the substantial presence test which requires you to physically be in the US for more than half the year. Unfortunately, there is no provision that will grant you work authorization in the US while allowing you to live abroad. The only way this would’ve been possible is if you also held US citizenship.

If your soon to be wife loves her job, you love your city, you're planning on having kids soon, etc... then that will need to take precedence. That might mean that you let Jan come and try to find a job in the meantime and tighten your belt a bit. Once kids come into the mix, you need to think long and hard about where you want to park for a second. \n\nDo you have any networks from college days? Is your manager understanding of the situation? If so, I would have a blunt conversation with them and ask them if you can use them as a reference or if they know anyone around the area that's hiring. Anyone you know that might be at a company, possibly hiring? The market is not great right now, and companies know this, so they're pulling whatever bullshit they can for attrition (my company is doing the same thing although maybe a softer version of yours). \n\nTo answer your question about your current knowledge, you might want to give yourself more credit. I doubt someone goes into a role for 4 years and \"everyone else is doing the work\". Have you received any promotions since starting? If that's the case, then you probably did something to get there. But the fact that you know Kotlin and Java is good, the industry is full of Java roles. So you could shift to Java (or C#... they're similar enough) and see what's out there. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's business to companies, but personal to you. This stuff can be really hard mentally and emotionally. I can't tell you which path to take, but if it were me, I would first ask yourself if you want to stay in mobile. If so, then focus on learning the rest of the process. Read up your code base, pick up more Kotlin, learn JetPack Composer, etc. If not, then consider a shift into learning more about Java and/or C# then try your luck there.\n\nMost importantly, talk to your partner about the move. If they will be happier where you are, then just explain that you'll be tightening belts until you can find something else. And if you need to, get a temporary job somewhere not related to CS until you can gnab that interview. \n\nAlso, look for any resources in the area for interview prep, resume editing, etc. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

Don't give up on that dream! Your analytics background is super valuable. Maybe you could look for ways to incorporate more data work into your current role? That could help bridge the gap. I've seen folks successfully pivot from DevOps to data science later on, so it's definitely possible. Keep building those analytics skills on the side. Have you checked out any online communities or newsletters for aspiring data pros? I write the Experimentation Career Blog on Substack which has some tips for breaking into analytics roles. Whatever path you choose, your diverse skills will be an asset. Rooting for you!",

        "body": "First thing I’d suggest is to pause the scattershot learning for a moment. It’s easy to feel like you need to chase every cert or language, but that often leads to burnout without real progress. Instead, reflect on what you enjoyed most from your tech role. Was it the problem solving side of coding, or the precision and detail that comes with testing? If testing was your comfort zone, roles in QA automation or SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) could be a natural pivot. These roles often let you leverage your coding skills while staying close to quality focused work.\n\nIf you’re craving something new, IT certifications can definitely open doors but you’ll want to be strategic. For example, if you go the cloud route, AWS Solutions Architect Associate or Azure Fundamentals → Administrator can get you noticed quickly. If you lean toward cybersecurity, CompTIA Security+ is a great starting point and pairs well with your testing mindset. The key is to pick one lane, commit, and build a portfolio around it. Whether that’s small projects on GitHub, automation scripts, or even freelance gigs on platforms like Upwork. Freelancing can also be a good bridge though it won’t always be glamorous, but it’s real world experience that helps fill the gap on your resume.\n\nIf you can structure the next 6–12 months around one clear goal say, “transition into cloud roles” or “move into automation testing” you’ll find it much easier to cut through the fog. And if you’d like more step by step advice, practical roadmaps, and career tips, [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) shares a lot of that. It might help you stay focused and feel less alone while you rebuild.",

I am a fullstack engineer and the biggest trouble I had with personal projects is the designs of my pages. I now can get AI to come up with a theme, a design, a layout, an admin dashboard, a home page and everything for me to use as a basis to build on and bounce my own ideas off.\n\nAlthough I think great design is unbelievably valuable, I think good design is fairly self evident. I mean, I can tell you if a site is well designed  - so can my mother. I dont think its difficult for AI to grasp this concept and produce designs for you. Almost all sites have at the very least the same layout; search bar at the top, nav bar top right/left and so on. Beyond this and the small design changes between different sites, I cant see design needing to be done in the way it is now. My team at work no longer needs the amount of designers we have - we got AI to design us a new view based on our existing views and it looked great.\n\nThe only exception to this (as always there are exceptions) will be exceptional designers in my option. Those designers who come up with new, unique almost game changing designs followed by many. AI wont be able to do this as easily, because AI needs a basis to train on. For example, in the late 2010's we got the gradient design you see on Stripe, with the scrolling animations as you scroll down. I think this design was game changing within the game of design, and so many sites followed this (I dont even know if Stripe were first tbh).\n\nI feel like if youre that good, original and can constantly change/push the bar, you'll be fine. However I would bet that most design teams will be shrinking in the coming 5-10 years.",

They usually do these round more than once, sometimes in person (on last steps, when they are almost ready to give you the offer).

For you most likely will be 1 round (and 2 for senior positions). If you've built any personal projects - you should be all set with this one, since they dont ask for that much. Examples from my experience - design autocomplete or url shortener.  \n\\- Final round, on this one the company runs 1 more round of something they are not sure about you. Like algorithms, or system design, so, just be prepared for more than 1 round of any type of interview.\n\nYou got this! Good luck",
