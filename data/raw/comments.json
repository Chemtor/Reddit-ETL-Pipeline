Instagram just deprecated their “plays” and “impressions” metrics and replaced them with a new metric called “views”.\n\n“Plays” was already a replacement for an older metric called “video_views”, and “plays” measured initial plays on Reels only. The new “views” metric includes replays. There was another metric deprecated called something like “reels_aggregated_plays” which included replays on Reels and therefore matched the new “views” metric.\n\nAlso new “views” populates for post types that traditionally wouldn’t get “video_views” because they aren’t technically videos: think carousels, images. New “views” are basically “impressions” but they’re higher than impressions for reasons we don’t really understand yet.\n\nFor almost a decade now we’ve been charged with creating cross-platform data sets that measure total video views. How do we do this when the metric you’ve always used for video views no longer exists, and views happen for more than just video? What we’re saying was a video view in March 2025 is not the same as what we’re saying was a video views in May 2025\n\nMy point is: this sucks ass. How are you going to validate these changes and explain the data to stakeholders? It’s great that you’re working with sources with well-defined schemas, but social media platforms do not keep things consistent for long, always introducing and redefining metrics and post types. Keep all the columns.",

We have on-prem data, some data is in Oracle or db2, and my division mostly lives in Synapse.\n\nThe Synapse data is often pulled from those other sources (via Synapse Pipelines or stored procedures), cleaned (usually in SQL, sometimes in pandas), and finally dumped into a table.\n\nNotice - there’s no bronze layer. I think this is the definition of ETL since we transform before we load. I could be wrong.\n\nWhat’s nice about this workflow: it minimizes costs and it reduces cognitive burden since, there’s fewer intermediate tables.\n\nWhat stinks about this workflow: it’s hard to reason about data lineage and there’s little to no audit trail. Where does this variable come from? Have to dig deep in some low level db just to find the source. If a table churns out questionable data, where did the mistake happen? Is it in the transformation logic, or was there some miscommunication with the source table? Again, tricky to understand. \n\nSo while having a dumping ground for raw  data seems redundant and can introduce extra expenses, sometimes it’s worth it. I believe that pattern is called ELT, since you load the ugly raw data into a new source system before cleaning it.\n\nAnother benefit of the bronze layer or ELT approach is that it can reduce the number of ad hoc queries against the low level transactional database, which slows everything down. And having the raw data under the same roof as your data warehouse’s clean data, again, opens up new forms of exploratory analysis.\n\nA nice compromise, instead of having permanent intermediate tables, is to have trunc and load tables that are refreshed at regular intervals. That way the data doesn’t eat up so many costs, but there’s still an audit trail for testing and observing data lineage.",

        "body": "Ways I would tackle it:\n\n1. Denormalized counters in your post record (small scale)\n\nYou add integer columns like `comments_count`, `likes_count` directly on your posts table.\n\nWhenever someone adds or removes a comment (or like), you increment/decrement that column instead of re‑scanning all comments.\n\nMost relational databases (Postgres, MySQL) can do an atomic `UPDATE posts SET comments_count = comments_count + 1 WHERE id = ?` cheaply, especially when that column is in memory.\n\nThis would be my first pick given you can ship this in minutes with zero infrastructure beyond your main database.\n\n2. Sharded or distributed counters (mid scale)\n\nFor “hot” posts with millions of comments/likes - think celebrities, viral content etc., a single counter can become a write hotspot.\n\nYou break it into N shards:\n\n    UPDATE comment_counter_shards\n       SET shard_count = shard_count + 1\n     WHERE post_id = ? AND shard_id = rand_between(1, N)\n\nTo read the total, you sum over those N shards. N is tuned (often 4–16) so no single row fights over locks.\n\nThis solution pays off only when your single‑row updates actually become a bottleneck (once you hit sustained write contention). Until then its probably an overkill.\n\n3. In‑memory caching (Redis, Memcached, etc.)\n\nMaintain the “current” counts in a fast key‑value store. On each write you atomically INCR or DECR the Redis key (e.g. post:123:comments).\n\nFeed readers pull from cache, falling back to the database only if the cache miss occurs.\n\nEach 1 & 2 solutions could be combined with this method for low-latency reads.\n\nI am about to drive - lemme think of other ways, I will edit and add to this post if something else comes up.\n\nUPDATE: Some more thoughts:\n\nTo keep write latency low, counters could update asynchronously (e.g. via a message queue).\n\nYou accept sub‑second lag in the displayed count in exchange for high throughput (which for non-YMYL stuff like like/comment count is acceptable).\n\nAlso worth noting, there are specialized data stores with native counters like Cassandra and Bigtable from Google. They support atomic counter columns across distributed nodes, so you offload the complexity of sharding and locking.\n\nBut if you are at that stage and its your own service, you probably made it and I want your job :)\n\nAnyways, its weekend. Going for some mountain touge with my Miata :D Peace out ✌️\n\nP.S. I am open for work - whether its data, MVPs or custom software. DMs open!",

Python + proper libraries + proper coding guidelines, can be safe enough and efficient enough for DE. Kind of like SQL, Python is often used as UI for a more efficient tool like Polars calling Rust code or Spark calling Scala/Java code.\n\nHowever, when possible, I prefer to use established frameworks like the Dagster orchestrator, dbt for transformation or some extraction tools like airbyte or dlt. The reason is not so much the pleasure of starting a new project with them or the time it saves when starting. It is rather the ease of on-boarding a new member into an established tool, instead of spending months training the person to a highly specific home-cooked solution.  I am also speaking from experience of being on-boarded into this kind of home-made complex ETL.\n\nScala had some history as a DE language because Apache Spark main UI used to be its Scala API. Then it introduced a Python API with similar performance, so the complexity of Scala could not be justified, and the language is globally dying for all its niche use cases, as far as I know.\n\nSo for me, it's not really a question of language, Python and SQL are consensual kings and here to stay.

My final role as a software engineer was a team lead in an insurance company. We had legacy C# desktop stuff, legacy web stuff (ASP.NET/PHP/ColdFusion), and more modern web stuff for the time (ASP.NET + Angular). I still used to write a lot of data engineering-like tasks in this job - financial services, so tons of integrating with SFTP servers and writing/ingesting XML everywhere. Heavy SQL Server stuff underpinned all of this, which is how I ended up in data.  \n  \nMy track in data was BI developer -> data engineer in wealth mgmt (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> data consultant (Azure/Databricks/Synapse) -> tech lead in retail (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> senior engineer in security for retail org (Python/BigQuery/dbt for analytics, Splunk for SIEM + security automation).  \n  \nI am a very code-heavy data engineer. Everything I do is in code except for dashboards, which I wish I could change. Regardless - and I get downvoted into oblivion here a lot for saying this - I don't view data engineering as anything close to software engineering. The needs, requirements, and use cases are all entirely different. Your average software engineer will fail even the most basic data modelling task these days. Most don't know SQL or even touch a database directly. Your average data engineer will struggle with anything beyond a basic CRUD app. They are different specialties and the code for data pipelines is simpler by many orders of magnitude. I have watched this time and time again with data engineers thinking they can just switch between the two. I even think if I tried to go back to my old ways in the C# ecosystem I would have a really hard time (forgetting that I'm about 10 years older now...)  \n  \nAny pivot is possible, but keep in mind it will take a long time. It took me something like five years to fully move to data engineering after a complete reskill, and that was still with my prior SQL history. I was just lucky that I had all the soft skills in my back pocket so I could get promoted easily. re: stakeholder stuff, I've always had to do things and figure out requirements on my own, so I think you need to develop that part of your brain a bit.",

        "body": "> orbits/predictions that would require going through the entire database more than once to establish relationships between planets/stars and calculate distances based on multiple columns and making sub queries based on the results\n\nThis aspect sounds like you want to step out of SQL for some steps, or at least generate intermediate tables. Generating a subquery based on the results of another query isn't really how CTEs work - a CTE just creates a view or 'virtual table' that you can query from. The 'going through the entire database more than once' sounds like you want to do some kind of iterative work, where you want to save the results at each step and move on.\n\nThis doesn't necessitate using a particular DB, but you might want to think about how you would approach some of these things in another language. Using Python, for instance, lets you make use of many different tools that work well together, it will let you take an imperative approach to calculating things, and you'll be able to easily write output data to files and review them using csv/jsonl/parquet formats.\n\nYou would also be able to set up long running processes to be done incrementally. Say you create a list of all systems 'A' to calculate the distance to all other systems 'B' - if this would take a long time, you can store a table with which 'A' systems have been done. Then your imperative program can just find the next 'A' system to calculate, and do the calculations for that. This sort of chunking might make processing more resilient to timeouts or memory issues.\n\n> if making multiple smaller tables with a few columns (5-10) or a single one with all columns (30-40) would be best\n\nIf you land on columnar storage like parquet, or duckdb's internal storage, then it doesn't matter how many columns you have. Their data layout means that all the data for a column is stored together, so it can completely skip over columns you don't need. The general tradeoff with columnar systems is they often make it a bit slower to pick out individual values. So if your main way of using the data is to grab out the data for a specific system, this isn't as efficient.\n\nIf you have a row-based store then you might be better served with multiple tables if you can organise columns into groups that are often used together. For example if coordinates aren't often used in conjuction with other columns, but you want to do a lot of work comparing coordinates, then you could split that off to its own table. If all the tables share the same primary key, and you make sure they are all indexed the same, it should be fine to perform joins between these tables. This is likely a relatively small optimisation, since it really just makes disk reads a bit more efficient.\n\n> The best database option that would basically be read only...\n\nThis mostly means that something based on columnar-storage will be fine. You aren't updating rows, so you don't need anything transactional. It doesn't preclude row-based systems either, so essentially everything is open to you.\n\nIf postgres is working for you, just keep it in there. That's fine.\n\nSQLite probably won't work - it doesn't have a compressed format, and you'll likely run into issues with the large data volume relative to disk size.\n\nIf most of what you are doing is running through lots of data at once, then you could convert the tables to parquet files and query with something like DuckDB, Polars, or Daft. Each of those also make it easier to script with python and exchange data from an sql processing model to an imperative one in python. Daft may have a benefit that it has a built-in method to spread execution to multiple processes on your machine, so if something goes oom it can recover and retry, and can spill intermediate steps to disk.\n\nOr, as others have mentioned, you could add an extension for duckdb to get data via postgres.\n\n---\n\nIn general, I'd leave things in postgres for now and see if you can point things like DuckDB at it, and see how their processing model works for you. Polars [can connect to a database](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.read_database.html) and [so can Daft](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/integrations/sql/). If you're going to hit OOM issues it will happen in this processing step regardless of how the data is stored, so if you try out a few different processing engines working off of the existing postgres data, you might find what works for you.\n\nIf any of these tools work for you, then you might consider shifting the data to parquet format as it may be smaller to store and more efficient to read. Every one of these can write data out to parquet ([duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/file_formats/parquet_export.html), [polars](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.LazyFrame.sink_parquet.html), [daft](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/api/dataframe/#daft.DataFrame.write_parquet).",

Postgres for sure is one of those, but for your use case you'd want an Analytic (OLAP) Database so you could use Clickhouse.\n\nDoing rankings is a typical analytic task with a window function. Establishing relationships, the full table scan part is just part and parcel of what a traditional database does but you going in and actually mapping the relationships you could use a CTE. Better yet would be something like dbt (data build tool).\n\nNow I'm not saying you'll be accessing all 225G's at once in which case *maybe*  you won't hit your 32G of system memory limit. I'm not sure queries you do plan on running. But to be on the safe side just use a traditional analytic server like Clickhouse and if it turns out that the queries you end up running don't have huge joins or aren't working with tables that are 60gigs at a time in size then you can just use DuckDB.\n\nEdit: How you end up modeling this data and what queries you run against it might be a separate issue. I think the baseline technical aspect is to get you up and running. \n\nActually one thing I hadn't considered is you can just keep running everything in Postgres since it's already in it, and then use DuckDB with the postgres extension known as pg\\_duck\n\n[https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html)",

All in a tool that could be easily updated, distributed, and used by nontechnical stakeholders. This was my first analyst gig too, so don’t expect anything too cool—it was 100% locally ran Python that generated an Excel file daily.\n\nIt was an Excel workbook with a summary sheet and another sheet for every country’s detail page. It used Excel formulas like HYPERLINK() to let users conveniently jump around the thing. Using Python allowed me to move a lot of the calculation backward into the Python step though, so I could basically bootstrap every cell with hardcoded values in its functions—no dynamic lookup stuff needed. It made the excel unmaintainable, sure, but it was quick as hell despite being big as hell. The python was maintainable, and I think that was the point. Excel was just the interface, getting generated every day from scratch.\n\nThe Python script would connect to like 8 different APIs (a corporate db, several Google APIs, Reddit, Meta, and two porn networks) and generate a fresh report every morning. It was actually easier to regenerate the whole thing every day, than to try updating any single copy. The sources maintained their own history, and I just pulled it in every single day. Worked like a charm. I don’t work there anymore, but I often think about how I hope they’ve upgraded that thing by now (assuming it’s still around).",

However, it can be a bit clunky with dynamic DAG generation, and the setup might feel overkill for lighter tasks.  Dagster shines with its focus on data assets and dependency management, which can be super handy with dynamic generation per user. Its built-in observability tools are really neat too, but some might find its approach a shift from traditional practices. Prefect offers dynamic task generation with a simple and Pythonic API, which can make it appealing for ease of use and quick iterations. It’s really intuitive for developers and scales well too.\n\nFor integration with your sources, DreamFactory could simplify API generation for RESTful endpoints, while tools like Stitch or Fivetran might handle the replication aspects you need. Ultimately, pick the framework that aligns best with your team’s skill set and project growth trajectory.",

        "body": "I'd say that an Inmon approach (at least originally, the man keeps evolving his ideas and publishing new books) compares better as a data architecture, much like a data mesh, more than Kimball (at least when he started, that guy kept on expanding his concepts as well).\n\nInmon's DW design favored more or less 3 data layers:\n- A raw layer, that started as a landing zone and eventually evolved to an \"operational data store\". Originally is way quite simple, but an ODS was supposed to provide operational level reporting capabilities, with even near real-time if possible (it was quite visionary when proposed in the 90s);\n- A Data Warehouse layer, which was supposed to have a fully integrated view of the business for analytical purposes. This matched mostly his definition: \"subject-oriented, non-volatile, integrated, time-variant collection of data\". The DW layer is rarely, if ever, accessed by BI tools or end users. It is the single source of truth that feeds the specific databases (next bullet) supporting analytic and decision nerds. As such, it tends to be more normalized (not really full 3NF, but in that direction), as this would make it more reusable for different sets of requirements - including future ones.\n- Data marts: these are tightly scoped to the needs of specific use cases. For reporting and BI, it's common to model those as Kimball star schemas; for data science, other formats, even files, are possible. For specific reports, it could be a very custom thing.\n\nThis actually is the source for a medallion architecture, and also became a full data architecture before Kimball came up with the concept of a DW using \"conformed dimensions\". I built quite a few DWs using Inmon's approach, and I can tell you they evolve well and survive a lot. The main challenges are:\n- Figuring out a good priority for which domains/subjects to build first. It's no use trying to model the whole DW layer before delivering something, but people still try that.\n- Knowing how to capture a business in its entirety in a data model. Eventually, as you iterate, you'll find inconsistencies, redundancies, things no one thought about, politics, etc. Solving those to one common model is hard; letting them pass reduces the value of the DW layer over time, putting g the entire architecture in check;\n- Compound effort of having data go through 3 layers (or more) before delivering value. Again, this is people just assuming they have to adopt and build it all before any value is delivered. My approach was to first do a high level business mapping in domains to identify opportunities and prioritize. The first 2-3 deliveries usually had very light landing and a straightforward middle layer model, generating stars was straightforward, fast and cheap. As the platform grew, complexity would be added but not as a burden - it is a way to actually represent the business and deliver higher-level analytics. The kind that needs cross domain analysis, decision and optimization. Doing that on top of starts is incredibly harder (been there, done that).\n\nInmon kept evolving his design, addressing data quality, unstructured data, real-time and others, but he lost importance as the world moved to cloud and Hadoop - even though he published about those and his designs were perfectly applicable there. It's more that everything pre-cloud and pre-agile was sort of left behind by a new generation.\n\nEdit:typos",

For example, in an Kimball/Inmon approach, Finance and HR would agree on one employee dimension, one org dimension, one account ledger, etc, but in a Data Mesh, the two domains could do things slightly differently to meet their orgs needs better. They would just delineate what reporting uses which data. That's my loose understanding anyway.",

Everyone will agree you should have adequate time to test, and then argue you should prematurely release something because of deadlines you agreed to - even if you didn’t agree to the deadline, and weren’t in the meeting, and your boss and their boss set it. They will also never understand that estimates of work are in series and not parallel.  Your manager will also happily reduce your estimate if it fits the deadline better.\n\nSo, basically, have everything you can in writing. I am fucking terrible at this.  Even this week I am two days overdue due to a specification the so far has four columns with formulas different to how they were implemented in the prototype, and it’s somehow my fault I am over my estimate and not the fault of the person who wrote an incorrect spec.",

If they're large enough, you save them as s3 objects in their own right. If they're small, you send them to something like Kinesis Firehose, which will automatically buffer objects up to 15mins/300MB and then save them out to s3.\n\nIf you want to track where you are up to, and you are running all this in a single process, you can just have a json object in s3 that you overwrite with the currently active data, so that if something stops or crashes you can pick up from the last request. If you have multiple concurrent processes or it is updating very fast, you can store it all in a tiny DynamoDB against a particular key.\n\n---\n\nMicrobatching ingestion into a single duckdb database sounds off. You replace objects in s3, so every write will be a full rewrite of the file. If you wanted to make data like this available to duckdb for processing, you would be writing append-only to some other file format that duckdb could read.\n\nFor remote data instances with updates like this, you might use duckdb as the processing engine, but you would be using an open table format like deltalake or iceberg to allow you to do write transactions on the data in a way that is more amenable to the way object storage works.",

If your descriptive concept has a 1:many relationship to a fact table (meaning only one description is related to a single record) then you directly join that dimension to the fact.  Title would be an example of that as a movie only has one title.  A many to many relationship would use a bridge table, in this case people.  There are many actors in each movie.  Generally you want to avoid many to many, but it's useful  for some cases like that.  I usually put a fact, or column to aggregate, in my factless fact tables as it's often easier to deal with in BI tools, but it's optional.  Y\n\nou also want to consolidate your dimensions so that related information is not in a separate table.  Title, title type and title season are all related, or do not differ across the rows of the fact.  A movie will always have been produced in the same season, have the same category, director or whatever.  If you wanted to represent movie revenue in your fact by region, then you would have a separate dimension for region as the same title would have several records in the fact with different regions and different revenue amounts.  \n\nHigh level looking at this I think you have a fact table, date dimension, title dimension and actor dimension with a bridge.

SQL Server 2025 is currently in Private Preview.\n\nThe two upcoming features I'm aware of that are most relevant are:\n\n1) Change Event Streaming\n\nI *believe* this will be in SQL 2025 as well from reading the year ahead post I link below, but I might be misreading it. \n\nAlso not sure off the top of my head what additional destinations they may support now - original post only says \"CES on **Azure SQL Database** and **Azure Event Hubs**, with plans to expand support for additional sources and destinations in the future\". There's a email address at the bottom of the post, or I can ask around :).\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/introducing-change-event-streaming-join-the-azure-sql-database-private-preview-for-change-data-streaming/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/introducing-change-event-streaming-join-the-azure-sql-database-private-preview-for-change-data-streaming/) \n\n\n\n2) Fabric Mirroring\n\nThis is a turn-key \"it just works\" native solution for SQL Server to Parquet in near-real-time - but it has one constraint that may be a non-starter for you - it can replicate to OneLake (which implements ADLS / Azure Blob Storage API), not S3. \n\nFrom there, you could use whatever ADLS-compatible tooling (including Databricks, Snowflake, Microsoft Fabric, et cetera) you like for further OLAP and reporting needs.\n\nAnnounced here [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/blog/2025/01/15/the-year-ahead-for-sql-server-ground-to-cloud-to-fabric/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/blog/2025/01/15/the-year-ahead-for-sql-server-ground-to-cloud-to-fabric/)\n\nShould be quite similar to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/mirrored-database/azure-sql-database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/mirrored-database/azure-sql-database) but for SQL Server 2025.\n\nOneLake also supports \"Shortcuts\" to translate between Storage APIs and avoid you having to move all your existing data; but I'm a bit fuzzy off the top of my head whether writes **to** S3 are supported ( [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-s3-shortcut](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-s3-shortcut) ) - OneLake is not my area of expertise, especially around the Shortcuts side of things.\n\n  \nDunno if you'll find either of those helpful - depends on if you are willing to upgrade to SQL Server 2025 and your exact requirements - but I thought I'd share in case you weren't aware. \n\nDisclosure: I work at Microsoft on Fabric Warehouse. Opinions my own.",

If you're open to non-OSS solutions, Glue can work, but it's not very flexible.\n\nalso curious: when you say DMS didn’t work well, was it reliability, speed, or something else? (just asking in case I run into a \\_lot\\_ of issues with DMS)\n\nif your team is okay with *some* managed stuff, and you still want log-based CDC that lands in S3 as parquet without having to orchestrate a bunch of infra, we at [Estuary](https://estuary.dev/) actually built a connector for exactly this SQL Server use case. happy to share more if you’re curious!",

Good for scheduled pulls or full-table loads, but not built for log-based streaming CDC. Dev UX is also clunky.  \n  \nFivetran / Airbyte – both batch ETL/ELT tools. Airbyte is not a scalable solution especially for high volume database; whereas Fivetran gets expensive real fast.  \n  \nCustom Python / AWS Glue – definitely an option, but as you mentioned, can become a huge maintenance burden. Hard to scale long-term.  \n  \nIf your goal is to stream CDC changes directly to S3 in Parquet without managing Debezium and Kafka or relying on batch jobs, there are a few CDC tools built specifically for this. One example is my company [Artie](http://www.artie.com/), which focuses on log-based replication from transactional DBs like SQL Server into cloud storage with minimal setup.  \n  \nHope this helps!",

At each major stage, you can insert lightweight validation gates to catch issues early, before pushing into the next phase.\n\nYou can use Soda Core for this (open source). It lets you define checks as YAML files and trigger them in Python or SQL-based workflows. Example:\n\n    checks for model_inputs:\n      - row_count > 10000\n      - missing_count(client_score) = 0\n      - min(transaction_amount) >= 0\n\nYou can run these after data ingestion, data transformation, and post-modeling (e.g. “no negative predictions” or “R² above threshold”).\n\nIf you’re curious, I just wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kmeqz2/lightweight_e2e_pipeline_data_validation_using/) about this type of lightweight validation using Python and YAML — not specific to ML models, but the idea applies.\n\nHappy to share how others have structured this if you want to go deeper.",

Ideally you can do it within your current role by putting your hand up to do those boring businessey meetings engineers hate, and get to talking at a strategic level to decision makers about what data engineering can do for them: so salesey, relationship management work.\n\nAnother option to step out of tech but not starting over are things like scrum master, product owner, etc., where the work is mostly people but your grounding in the processes of delivering data and software will give you a head start.\n\nAnd also, consider whether it's the field you're in or just your job or company. In larger orgs you get pure data engineers who turn specs into code and bugs into fixes, but in smaller orgs data people tend to have to wear more hats so have more direct contact with the business instead of relying on BAs or similar to deliver specs to you.",

I just didn't know I hated it.  I always recommend for anybody who has worked in IT and gotten used to basically hating their job for money, go and do something you love.

All that adds up & up.\n\nSo DIY sounds cheap upfront, but you’ve got to factor in **total cost of ownership**:\n\n* Time to build\n* maintenance\n* Debugging\n* Onboarding new engineers\n\nAnd additionally, something that a lot of people miss:\n\n* Opportunity cost (what else you could be building)\n\nSometimes it’s worth buying the tool just to save your team from being stuck in ETL land forever.. but sometimes it makes sense to build it yourself because of environmental restrictions or special requirements.\n\nI’d throw together a quick comparison matrix with rough costs (time, effort, reliability) for each option.Doesn’t need to be perfect, just enough to focus on the tradeoffs. Try to shift the conversation from “what’s cheapest today” to “what will cost less over the next year and more”",

I've already got a comparison matrix started, I'll make a point to add more of the long-term costs in there as those do get overlooked/hidden in the \"just write some python\" version of things.  Mainly because that means I do it and nobody else feels the pain lol.\n\nIf you were going from azure sql to azure sql and just wanted to handle the data copy/replication side of things so you could work in dbt from thereafter, is there a favored tool or approach you'd use if you had \\~50 databases each with \\~200 tables?  All of which are *mostly* identical in schema, but not totally?   Our group is pretty good in dbt and managing CI/CD with it.    \n  \nBut handling the replication is what's slowing me down on this project, and all these expensive tools do a lot more than replication, so in a way we don't really need all that functionality if we are cool with dbt (or maybe eventually sqlmesh but IMO it's not quite mature enough yet to where I want to use it at large scale, but maybe that's being overly conservative).  \n\nWhere I've landed for teh \"built it\" version is a data factory pipeline where we try to parameterize as much as we can so it can be deployed.  But I'm also kind of attracted to standing up open source airbyte, building out the replication for one database, exporting to json, then parameterizing that and using a github action to deploy wider.   Mainly because I think it would probably be cheaper to just run that on a moderately large VM, than pay for a ton of ADF time, which adds up quick.",

In cell-based architecture, we develop various products and services in these cells that contain a grouping of cloud-based resources. It's not uncommon to have one of those cloud-based resources be a database or storage like an S3 bucket or blob storage depending on your cloud provider. With proper isolation in the cloud, you may have a database per environment, which leaves production having production data and dev with no data.\n\nHowever, depending how you use the data in said database, which you didn't provide, will give you the key to handling that missing data in dev. For example, if you developed an AWS Lambda Function that needs to connect to that database, read in data, do something with it, then write it somewhere else, then you don't really need production data to test that. You can mock database connection and data to test the AWS Lambda Function code without production data or the live database connection.\n\nThat being said, if you're testing things like canned reports, dashboards or even ML process, then you just need to look into generating dummy data or completely anonymizing the data much like they do in healthcare. What you **SHOULD NOT DO** is bring over production data into the lower environments because you should treat everything below production as **UNSECURED ENVIRONMENTS**. The reason for that is because until it hits production, everything should be in test mode. The exception may be hot fixes if you branch those off production and staging environments depending on your branching strategies.\n\nI say this because while YOUR PRODUCTION DATA may not be sensitive, it's just good practice not to open that can of worms incase sensitive data does accidently spill over because you already opened the door.",

I've found that managed services like ClawCloud's add-on for Postgres can really help by automating this with zero config. It saved us from those annoying max_connection errors.\n\nFor your research on StarRocks, Druid, Doris, and ClickHouse, I'd suggest starting with their official docs and community forums. They often have real-world examples and discussions that can highlight common gotchas and pain points. Also, check out some case studies or blog posts from folks who have already made the switch to these systems. That should give you a good sense of what to expect.\n\nGood luck with your POC! 🚀",

Now five years into it programming anything tastes like sand and I have no passion for it.\n\nDon't make my mistake. Only go into this field if you'd do it as a hobby for fun. Because you're going to end up doing it all work day and all evening every day of your life if you hate it. If you love it you'll seek it out for fun and want to learn more. Without passion it takes so much longer to stick because you'd rather be thinking about filing taxes or sitting at the DMV..\n\nDo some soul searching. College costs too much to get a degree in something you'll be forced to do the rest of your life and hate..",

This isn't at all a neutral choice. But you likely can't master 3-4 even as a senior. You just forget anyway. So pick maybe 1 main language and a second one. Pick popular one that may sense: Java, Python, javascript, C#.\n\nAnd each ecosystem is strong for some stuff and bad at others. C++ first strength isn't to code web applications for example. Java or python will not work that well for real time code. You don't write big industrial app in python...\n\nI don't think you need a portfolio and most of the time professional experience is valued much more than personal projects. Honestly even as beginner 1-2 internship are much more valuable than any portfolio. Once you have a bit of XP, the XP matters much more.\n\nYou could almost always find solutions to most problem with the right Google search. Now it is just asking your preferred AI. Learn how to use these tools, really. Sure internal stuff you may have no choice, but in many case the info is just here.\n\nMany company will ask you to code something for interview and will ask technical/architectural questions. Train for interviews. Train for the coding exercise and train for architectural question as well as other interviews aspects.\n\nOnce you are hire, you get a bit more time.

        "body": "You should read about Git itself, what it's purpose is, and how it works fundamentally. Git is the actual tool here, it's an industry standard version control methodology. Github is just one of many tools that harness the power of Git. You can practice using Git directly on your own machine without using any other tool (and without even using code) if you want. You can just use a text file and practice committing and merging changes to the text via git.\n\nThe basics are, essentially: You have a code base. You want to make one or many changes to that code base, but you want to keep the current state intact so you dont lose your functionality. You create a branch, which is an exact copy of that same code base. You make your changes to the branch. You test the branch. If it's a failure, it doesn't matter because the \"main\" branch hasn't been modified yet. When you get it to work properly, you merge your branch into the main branch. Now your main branch reflects the changes you've made. Repeat. \n\nIt gets a little more complicated when you've got many people working on many branches at a time, which is when the pull requests and reviews come into play. That stuff exists so that someone who is familiar with the code base can be a second set of eyes, check your work, make sure there aren't conflicts with other people's work, etc. The whole construct exists so there is an easy way to do parallel development work on the same code base without actually changing the working code before the changes have been tested and reviewed.",

        "body": "I think when trying to learn it often ends up sounding more confusing than it actually is as a concept. Obviously there are layers and layers of complexity but at first I would try to understand at its core what it is. \n\nImagine there’s a massive library of handwritten books and your team need to make various amendments to different ones. Someone has written a list of requirements for you. \n\nYour team divides up the tasks. Your first task is to remove any mentions of parrots from “My Life as a Hamster (1974)” - don’t ask why. Better not to ask too many questions in this team. \n\nTo do that, you check out the single book (My life  as a hamster) from the library and tell everyone else you’re doing it for transparency. \n\nYou do your stuff. \n\nNow you could just go and pop the book back on the shelf as you’ve finished but what if you’ve made a mistake? Instead you put it in a little box for “review” and your other team mates can have a look and check they’re happy with your work. Once they are, it goes back in to the library. Yours is now the correct version for that book. \n\nOf course you don’t want to shut down the entire library while you do your job which is why this strategy of checking one book out, making changes, getting it reviewed and putting it back in works well. \n\nEveryone can be doing different tasks at the same time. The library itself remains central and “pure” - hopefully with your robust review box, no mistakes are getting in. The library is a single point of truth - everything in there has been approved and checked and is correct. Any mistakes are picked up in review. \n\nNow instead of a library, as a developer, what you’re working on is digital. \n\nIt means that people are working on all different books (files). Sometimes people might even be working on the same book but doing a different task. While you’re doing your hamster task, someone else is updating page numbers in all rodent books including your hamster one. \n\nSometimes this can cause a bit of confusion if you make changes to the same page but luckily Git gives you a nice simple (ish) way to fix these and decide which changes to keep when there’s  such a conflict.\n\nMost importantly, to reiterate, despite all these complicated changes all happening at once, the library itself is pure and “correct” - because people cannot make changes and put the book back. They need check out books, make changes, then put it into the review box (make a pull request) and others in the team must approve it before it goes back in (gets merged in) to the library. \n\nIt may help, moving away from the library analogy, to imagine the alternative. Imagine word documents named version1, version2 etc. imagine everyone trying to change it at once. Everyone saves their own local copy. But someone else has changed the same bit you were going to. Whose bit goes in? Soon nobody has any idea which version is the right one. People are no longer copying the original. - they  are copying version 17. But oh wait, while you were doing something, version 18 became available and now all those changes aren’t in yours.",

You’re trying to train your brain to think in abstractions, understand decomposition, generalization, managing complexity, logic, and structure. That’s what CS is for. That’s what good teaching is for. And no, you don’t need to build the next Minecraft, in fact trying to do that too early is gonna confuse you more.\n\nOn the other hand, if you really want to build something, being a app, a game or wathever, then code becomes the tool but not the subject. You’ll learn plenty by doing, that's for sure, but your brain is focused on making it work, not on understanding the system. The trap is thinking the second automatically teaches the first. Sometimes it does, with enough reflection. But often, it builds habits that are hard to unlearn later.\nIf you want to learn programming, keep it small, controlled, and concept-driven. Then build up.

You do a lot of obligatory null checking or similar exception avoidance where you would need an if statement normally. And you need to do this a couple dozen times for different properties. Using a ternary lets you keep a block of all your property assignments that’s likely to fit on your screen and be easier to read and check off against a mapping spec. \n\nIn normal coding, I prefer if statements. The style should make the pattern obvious while skimming a thousand lines of unfamiliar code base. My eyes are going to naturally see the loop and conditional blocks first and I may not read every assignment until I find the section I’m looking for. If a critical condition is camouflaged to look like part of an assignment block, that’s annoying.",

It keeps the entire thing on one line just so that things don't look as messy and cluttered, and the presence of the operator itself tells you that we have a 1-liner going on here.\n\nIn other languages that don't have them, I still tend to prefer the 1-liner for the same reasons, but I also just feel weird about it because it's not as immediately apparently what's going on. I'll use some Free Pascal as an example, because that is unfortunately my favorite language to work with.\n\n  \nIn C/C++\n\n    // no ternary\n    if (X > Y) {\n      return X;\n    } else {\n      return Y;\n    }\n    \n    // ternary\n    return (X > Y) ? X : Y;\n\nIn FPC\n\n    // no \"ternary\"\n    if X > Y then begin\n      exit(X);\n    end else begin\n      exit(Y);\n    end;\n    \n    // \"ternary\"\n    if X > Y then exit(X) else exit(Y);\n\nFor me, the ternary operator just makes it easier to parse because I know that its function is pretty much to facilitate the cleaner 1-liner. In FPC and other language that don't have one, it's only very slightly more effort to figure out what's going on, but it still kinda rubs me the wrong way and I might want to just use the whole if..else block to make the intention more clear.\n\nAll that being said, it's basically all inconsequential and up to personal preference. I can't see getting upset over seeing multiple blocks of conditionals vs. multiple 1-liners.",

Learned about SIMD (same instruction multiple data) and how python as an interpreted language works with compilation to byte-code and finally being ran by the cpython virtual machine, as well as how using numpy and vectorization drastically reduced the compilation step as numpy uses precompiled C/Fortran subroutines.

Find the curriculum of what you want to learn on a university website. Find ressources to learn the topics (if they give the books used for the courses, buy them and study them).

I deemed acceptable if I ended above 90%, with the last 10% me having understood the concept but maybe lacking excellent execution).  \n\n> without getting overwhelmed?  \n\nYou will get overwhelmed. It's normal. Learn to deal with that. You'll need discipline to stay on schedule (yes, build a schedule for your learning path), and a schedule slow enough so that you can consistently be 1 week ahead in case you stumble onto something difficult that requires 1 full week of research and work to grasp. It will happen.  \n\nSource: I did self-teach maths, statistics, and a bit of programming up to bachelor level (I think it's that equivalent in the US, 3 years into college), and managed to get accepted in a master's degree.

You need to learn by doing projects because projects by definition have an end. Tutorial Hell is like open world games, you can just keep going. \n\n1. What I did was to set myself projects which interested me that we adjacent to the kind of tasks I'd be doing in a job. In my case it was an analysing books to understand the relationships between characters. I also had other ideas around web-scraping for data journalism type use cases. \n\n Rabbit-holes are great and you should dive into them, but having a project tethers you to what you're trying to achieve and you can drag yourself back because you start to feel guilty that you've not made progress. If your goal is undefined \"I'm going to learn\" that mindset will encourage you to keep going deeper. For example, in my case I spent time working out how to get data into pandas, but I also went down some rabbit-holes of anonymous functions and different file formats which were good to know, but not directly applicable. I didn't get into what's possible to do in numpy because my motivation was to get my project done, not to learn learn learn. \n\n1. Same answer as the other two. \"Do projects.\" 99.9% of programming is going to fall outside of your project's scope, so it naturally limits you to a domain that should be manageable. If it doesn't, then the programming mindset of continually breaking down the problem until you have something you can solve or you can research how to solve it will get you the rest of the way.",

It could only be FreeRTOS like.\n\nAnd to be fair, it's a horrible idea to do this. ESP32 is built on FreeRTOS. Most of the SDKs rely on FreeRTOS. And since BT and WiFi are undocumented binary blobs, you would have to reverse engineer it fully to get support (as a beginner, you wont be able to do this. Even as a professional its question of months). Other than that, I think everything else is fairly okay at documentation. Im sorry, but it seems that your professor has no clue what he is talking about.\n\nYou might be luckier with STMs (especially the H7 dual cortex ones). But why go down embedded OS way? If something go for plain old x64 or even RPi. This assignment doesn't make sense.\n\nIf you want to get into embedded, just use STMs or ESPs without that fancy shit. Its hard enough by itself. If you are interested in higher lever low level (like userspace Assembly or OSDev) then just go with your regular x64. Both Linux and Windows works. If you have no clue what you are doing, Windows might be harder for beginners.\n\nEdit: the H7 actually doesnt have a dual cortex dev board that's below 300 dollars iirc. Its a shame. Lower end H7s do. I would really appreciate if someone would make one for the higher end H7s that does not have all the fancy things EVAL has.",

Why is JavaScript good for web development? Is it especially suited for manipulating HTML? No, but it is the only languages (let's ignore wasm for now) that is available in the browser so you have to use it...\n\nWhy use C# for game development and not Java? Because someone made the application Unity and chose C# as the language to use and Unity was a bloody great application. Yes, C# has stuff that makes it useful for developing games, but it could have been Java.\n\nPython is an easy language to pick up and that has of course played a role in it's popularity for AI, but today, since it has become a very common language for AI, all the new libraries need to support Python as well, making it less and less likely that any \"more suitable\" language can take its place.",

If all the web browsers supported LUA or some new language, then maybe JavaScript wouldn't be he language of choice. Additionally you could argue that TypeScript is the web development language, but it's compilation phase turns it into JavaScript...so is it TypeScript or JavaScript?\n\nI suspect Java and Android is because Java existed, was free, and android needed some language for programmers to develop in.  Also JAVA is nice in that it really hides the hardware/OS from the development process.  You can develop a JAVA app on Windows, Linux, MacOS and be reasonable certain it will run in the Android OS.\n\nI would ague against C++ as the king of the OS, C is more the king of the OS development.  Mostly because all the popular OSes were developed when C++ had more overhead and ran slower, so writing the code in C avoided those issues.  You really don't want your OS to be slowing you down.  \n\nThe Linux Kernel for example is all C and now Rust maybe, I'm not sure.  I suspect Windows is all C.  These days C/C++/Rust are good because they compile down to native CPU instructions so your program has the least amount of overhead.  There is a cost however, in that you have to handle idiosyncrasies between hardware and OSes yourself.  This may be as simple as just compiling for that hardware, but can have other issues.\n\nC# and games I have no comments on.  My guess would be time to market, some programming languages let you produce code faster with fewer bugs, the code may not run as fast as code written in another language, but as long as it runs \"fast enough\" then people will buy it, the company will make money, and the developers will get paid, so everyone is happy.",

You have the enshrined problem (this language is used for this field, so all the tools use that language, and at some point its hard to 'break in' with another language to do the same thing, even if it would be great for it).  You have the 'no can do' problems, like java has a ton of things it simply will not do without arm twisting and work arounds, like operator overloading.  Not a big deal you say?  Consider some linear algebra: AX=B.  In C++, that could look like B = A\\*X;  In java that has to look like B.assign(A.multiply(X));  Now imagine an equation with 5 or 6 pieces in it written the java way... it looks nothing like the math and is hard to write, hard to read, and hard to maintain.   There are several other key things java does not directly support that make it frustrating to use for some tasks, including a bizarre workaround just to have an unsigned int.   Java has nice stuff too, though: it works pretty cleanly on various OS without the frustration that some C++ projects can present when porting.   \n\nC# is tied heavily to windows, and windows has 'won' the gaming audience by and large.  Less so today, but like the enshrined problem with languages, gaming is enshrined in windows very heavily (compared to other desktop OS).  Between that and game engine support and native OS tie in, it has a leg up right away.  Then you add in the pointers and other support that push it towards C++ and away from java's rigid approach, and its performance, you start to see why it pulled into the gaming industry.  Java got (and deserved) a bad rep early on for being slow, and while that has been fixed in a broad sense, it still suffers from the rep and the reality (it still isn't as fast as c++ when push comes to shove). \n\nSo to sort of try to answer.. its a mix of the language's performance, tools, design, and so on alongside an almost 'social' problem of getting a foothold in an area that is already dominated by something else.  New languages come and go, but the ones that stick and are used heavily in any field get there by being better than what was used before.  Python is kind of an oddball there, as its niche is being easy to use for hobby programmers, which is an area that has grown huge (everyone wants a little knowledge now) in the last 20 years or so.  In the 80s and 90s, most people were happy if they could use a word processor without too much work.",

        "body": "You not only need to \"learn programming\". Learning a programming language is like 1% of what you need to learn. The most important aspect you have to acquire is thinking like a dev. Problem solving skills above all else. Languages are the easy part, especially these days where like 70% of the main languages follow the same syntax and if you're able to use one, you'll get used to another one in a few days (OOP related). Besides that, most jobs not only ask for a language, but a specific set of technologies such as Docker + Kubernetes + GCP + Java + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL. Learning development isn't learning a language, it's learning to solve problems. How you solve those and which tools you use is another topic and most of the time you can choose between multiple tools to solve the same task. Another - in my opinion - important aspect is that you need to be able to explain complex tech heavy topics as simple as possible without using the word \"code\" once. Many companies work in agile environment with different products, roles and departments and you'll have a lot of meetings where you have to explain what you did in simple terms so that every PO understands it. In your case, you should first find out what you're lacking the most, which will probably be problem solving skills as it is for most devs. If you have not even build a single private project yourself once,  it's very unlikely that you're ready to work in a professional development environment in a year. Developing a private project and developing a b2b project as an example are totally different worlds. \nBut thats just my take. Ask 10 devs and all 10 will have different opinions and approaches. The most important question right now which you should ask yourself is \"what exactly do I want to achieve?\".",

The LineItem table doesn’t describe the product itself. It represents an economic transaction, and the price it refers to is not the current catalog price, but rather the price snapshot at the time of the sale, specifically referred to that order.\nIn fact, this is exactly where discounts, custom prices, or promotions could apply. Directly in the LineItem. Tying it only to the current Product data breaks the integrity of historical records and assumes that product attributes are timeless, which they clearly aren't.\n\n\nEdit i see many answers with triggers, other tables and so on. If you move redundancy out of a table that should be ,because of semantic, \"denormalized by design\"  you are not removing redundancy from DB and you have an inconsistent LineItem table as result.\nNormalization should not be \"never replicate data, even when it has different meaning\".\n\nNormalization is a technical tool that originated because, before ORMs, data persistence was handled directly by application code, which led to all sorts of issues. The idea was to solve these problems by abstracting the physical layer of persistence and using relational algebra rules to optimize the logical design.\nBut normalization must be subordinate to proper modeling of entities and meanings.\nFor example, suppose you have a product_quantity field in a product catalog table, meaning \"units per package\", and another product_quantity field in a warehouse table, meaning \"units in stock\".\nShould you normalize the schema to avoid redundancy, or disambiguate the semantics first?\n\nThe answer is obvious: semantics first.

I'd prefer to go for known certs like COMPTIA, cisco, Python Institute because HR might recognise these names, compared to udemy and LinkedIn learning. \n\nDefinitely make a good project you can be proud of. It's easier to show the technical managers what you have built than just yapping about it. In my experience, everyone in the webdev bootcamp I have attended, knows that personal projects are crucial to land a job, but most end up not building anything either way.\n\nAlso, I think Python is agood starting point, but if I were you, I'd pick a niche on top of python. For example build an API server using python, or build an automation script using python. \n\nThat way, if you got offer for role that's not related to python, you can still explain the technology and mechanisms, even though they are using different programming language. \n\n\nI know I'm still very junior, but I'm sharing this to paint the picture of the path you may experience as a career shifter. It may be easier for you, or it may be harder. Good luck!",

Then imagine how it is played in real life, you have a deck made of cards, you have a dealer, you have one or more players, players ask for cards (or the dealer draws cards), they bet, and the one closer to 21 points wins. Write down in text the interactions, like \"the dealer shuffles two, three, four decks of cards\", \"the dealer deals one card to every player\", \"the players bet\", etc, etc, and then find the nouns and the verbs. Nouns are potential classes (player, dealer, card, deck, bet, etc) whereas verbs are potential methods (deal, bet, withdraw, etc). Then build the relations between the different nouns, in terms of pure OOP how the player interacts with the dealers, what is the \"protocol\" between them, which \"messages\" does the player expect the dealer to handle, which \"messages\" the dealer expects the player to handle, etc.\n\nMaybe you should begin with simpler designs? Like create a File class that lets you work with files? Create a Calculator class that lets you execute math operations? That might help.",

And even then, be very careful with it, keep it absolutely minimal, and don't layer it. Especially multiple inheritance.\n\n\nDon't use static props and methods in your design. They are typically just a bandaid on what could otherwise be done by regular props and methods. They're mainly helpful when you code yourself into a corner and don't want to redo large bits, so don't use them in the beginning.\n\n\nDon't try to organize your code according to the typical OOP tutorials. It never works. Real world code is not made out of Dogs and Rectangles.\n\n\nIf you're fighting the multimethod problem, aka if you cannot decide between doing `dog.eat(food)` or `food.eatenBy(dog)`, consider making an `Eating` class, and then call `eating.eat(dog, food)`.\n\n\nUse OOP mainly to encapsulate state, as in, have each object only directly talk to its own data. Don't modify values inside objects other than self. Use getters/setters. That way you can intercept the modifications and ensure that the data within the object is always consistent.\n\n\nTry to have classes that are either mostly/fully just data, or mostly/fully just functions. Those are your \"nouns\" and \"verbs\", analogical to the structs and functions in non-OOP languages.\n\n\nBe perfectly happy with making a class which is only instantiated once. In fact, most of your classes should probably be instantiated only once.\n\n\n\"The problem with OOP is that you want a banana, but you get a monkey holding a banana, inside the rest of the jungle\" - someone else's quote.\n\n\nOOP is too much. It's a huge pile of features. The worst thing you can do is trying to use them all just because they exist.\n\n\nConsider this: goto and global variables exist too.\n\n\nWrite a basic class that doesn't inherit anything, add regular methods, regular properties, one constructor if needed to pre-fill the properties, and then instantiate it and use it.

Most of the top software engineers make a ton of money at work and then spend their free time with their families and friends—they don't hang around on Reddit all day typing comments about OOP. Typically it's the jobless, the students, or the juniors with low responsibility at work who have extra time and motivation to hang around on programming forums all day. Exceptions apply of course, but that's the general gist of it.\n2. Most of the best software out there is written with OOP, Java, C++... Basically with everything that you don't see as being fancy or recommended on Reddit.\n\nCan you find a connection between these two points?\n\nCould it be that the real seniors who are working on real projects and being paid top money are still using OOP, Java, C++, etc.? Or to be more accurate, they use whatever works the best for the task at hand, whether that's OOP or FP or something else entirely?\n\nMeanwhile the \"seniors\" who either 1. haven't quite grasped OOP *yet*, or 2. gave up after they failed once instead of thriving to improve —are the very people who are most active on these forums, trying to justify their opinions to others, religiously hating the most successful and widespread paradigm of all time instead of learning the ups and downs of each approach.\n\nSo why do these people hate OOP in the first place? Because it's easy to get wrong. It's an insanely potent tool when used right, but it takes years of experience, active studying, experimenting, and trial and error to get right. They've seen horrible inheritance trees based on the \"is-a\" vs \"has-a\" rule, which completely fails if you use it with the English language rather than the physical constructs. Some examples of this going with English are:\n\n- Wrong: A football player *is-a* human -> `FootballPlayer extends Human`\n  - Correct: A human *has-a* job or a hobby -> `player.hobby = football`\n- Wrong: An invisible video-game enemy *is-a* video-game enemy -> `InvisEnemy extends Enemy`\n  - Correct: An enemy character *has-a* opacity -> `enemy.opacity = 0.0`\n- Wrong: An android phone *is-a* phone -> `Android extends Phone`\n  - Correct: A phone *has-a* operating system -> `phone.os = android`\n\nThese are just some of the examples where following the English language fails you, and where you should rely on the [Composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) principle instead. Of course people have taken this too far to the other extereme as well, going as far as erasing all of language support for inheritance and forcing inheritance through composition... which sucks as well. Android very much *is-a* operating system, and Firefox very much *is-a* browser.",

A lot of their confidence comes from their own intelligence. They are in an industry that validates that intelligence, and celebrates sharing that intelligence. This can lead to many thinking that if they’re really smart, and their way of thinking is really efficient, and it works, and they can see how other people agree that it works, then therefore it must be the ONLY or at least the BEST way. \n\nAnd that’s where they lose me.

It is very useful.\n\nFor designing the standard is Figma, do the same find course on YT and practice.\n\nFor building your first project, that would be enough, and then you will advance in your knowledge and pick up new technologies that will fit your needs\n\nLet me know if you have some specific questions regarding technologies",

They also have to accept help when I offer it. They choose when, but they have to accept or else, I'll be taking the task if they can't handle it and everyone is frustrated. And they shoot themselves in the foot. \n\nSo my main idea is:\n\nIt's cool to want to get things on your own. But you are given help to be able to do more than that. So please use that. Use your mates whatever the level, raise warning about your blockers, communicate.\n\nYou can get things on your own, on your own time... That's a bit harsh, but the project needs to move forward. Else, you'll be ejected from the project.\n\nIt's more important to raise warning, that's team play. You're not alone in this, you shouldn't at least (I may have missed something in your post).\n\nEdit: to answer the part where the team doesn't answer fast enough. Tell your manager and insist. By communicating at least you show that you want the project to succeed.",

Before we evaluate, we must be able to analyze.\n3. Before we analyze, we must be able to apply knowledge/skills.\n4. Before we apply, we must understand what we do and why we do it.\n5. Before understanding, we must be able to recall accurately.\n\nThings slipping through your mind is a signal that the foundations aren’t strong enough, and frankly this is an iterating process of discovery whenever you try new things.\n\nBe patient and start slow.\n\nStart by mirroring the stupid simple stuff until you are able to recall facts and the basics.\n\nThen practice explaining the ideas or concepts behind what you are doing. Also, predict and test experiments to facilitate assimilation; e.g. what would happen if I DO or DONT DO something? What if it’s slightly different?\n\nProgress into applying your knowledge into solving simple and complex problems. A simple problem is one where you directly apply some knowledge. A complex one is where you first need to decompose into smaller problems, then build up to the bigger more general solution.\n\nWhen you are comfortable with those, the next cognitive level is analysis. Draw connections among ideas, compare them against others.\n\nAfter that you’ll be able to confidently evaluate options and alternatives and justify your decisions (and if proven wrong, then you’re still learning more).\n\nFinally, after all that, you’ll become able to synthesize all that knowledge and skills with fluency so that most of your efforts are focused on designing and creating solutions.\n\nPracticing the basics, over and over, will naturally put you in a position to apply what you learned and eventually reach mastery.\n\nThis framework can help you charter your learning journey—yet the key remains being patient and consistent.",

You can't whittle it down yet; it will whittle itself down as you get more experienced. Start anyway. Be prepared to forget a lot the first few times you do it: memory builds up gradually and incrementally, not all at once.\n\nSooner or later, you'll have used for loops (or whatever) so much that you can throw away your old notes on them entirely, or refine those notes into just the tricky little corners you keep getting stuck on or some cool new feature you heard about recently.

Your notes can evolve with you.\n\nTry working through a tutorial on whatever language you're learning, and every week or three, pause to design yourself a \"cheat sheet\" of what you've learnt so far.

I had issues with fine motor control, basically it hurts to write.  The biggest issues with this is that my penmanship sucks, and I trained myself to get to the point quickly.  I would write just enough to get the point across.  This didn't help my English grade when I need to write a three page paper.  So I had to constantly go back and be more descriptive.  My family got a home PC and this helped, but I still needed to write out all my answers for tests.\n\n2. My short term memory was found to be lacking.  This frustrated my parents because if I wasn't actively listening to them when they told me to do something I would literally not remember what they said, or often not even remember we had a conversation.  Of course the way around this was they had to make sure they had my full attention before telling me to do something.\n\n3. There might have been other stuff, but I don't remember. \n\nLooking back on school, I did well in Math and Science where I would understand the concepts and apply them.  I did poorly in History and English where there is a lot of memorization.\n\nI am now the lead programming architect at my company.  If people have bugs they can't solve, they come to me.  If people don't know how to write something, they come to me.  If there is a bug anywhere in our code base, I can fix it, not because I remember exactly what that code does, but I understand how that code should work.\n\nWhen programming people start off learning the language, which is needed.  The only way you are going to remember the language is by using it, by writing programs. I \"know\" many many languages, I will learn a new one for fun to see if I like it better than whatever is currently my favorite, but if I don't program in a language for a month, I have to use google to refresh my memory.\n\nTruthfully, anyone can learn a programming language, but to really program you need to be able to think logically, you need to be able to break big problems down into smaller tasks, then break those smaller tasks into even smaller tasks.  You keep doing that until those tasks are small enough that you can logically perform them in a programming language....any programming language.  The language is just a way to tell the computer what it needs to do and there are many ways to do that.  Again the only way to get good at that, is to program.",

        "body": "Learning programming shouldn’t be about memorization. Programming is the one discipline where it’s actually encouraged to rely on the internet as much as you want since it would be impractical for us to remember every little detail about every language and library we use, and most programming languages and libraries have extensive documentation online.\n\nOnce you are past learning the fundamental structures of code (data types, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.) everything you want to do with code is just a few well-constructed google searches away. Learning to code is as much about learning how to do efficient research as it is about learning actual coding.\n\nI will say, having short term memory just emphasizes the need for good coding practices even more, which many beginners tend to neglect. Good coding is all about foresight, and sacrificing time in the present to save you work in the future. Make sure you take the time to write yourself clear and helpful comments at every step of the way while coding and whenever you see multiple ways of writing some code, choose the way that is easiest to read; this will save you so much mental strain down the road. You should be able to tell generally what a piece of code does just by looking at it for a few seconds, even if it’s like you’ve never seen it before.\n\nYou’ll also learn there are ways of structuring your code such that you don’t have to remember how the whole system works all at once in order to understand one piece of it. This is actually one of the key tenets of object oriented design, often called “abstraction”. The better you learn to follow these design principles the easier of a time you will have coding bigger and bigger projects.",

It’s not about how much you can hold in your head. It’s about how well you think. Good programmers don’t memorize everything. They build tools, take notes, name things clearly, and break problems into steps. That's all there is to it.\n\nTL;DR - You don’t need perfect memory.

Bring it up with your manager.\n\n  \nOverall, what you're describing, I have to agree with the other commenters that you want to look for a different job.

It'll be hard to get hired.\n\nAnd finally, the hard lessons we all eventually learn ... You're hired on to solve business needs.

Ask your manager what task is most important and tell them you'll be focusing on that for the next few days and drop everything else. Are people constantly showing up at your desk, needing things? Tell them politely to send you or your manager an email, and you'll look at it later.

Letting me become absorbed by the content as if it was a movie, helps me retain more information, but it's different.\n\nWhen I'm reading documentation, the wiki allows me to keep searching between hyperlinks. I can resolve doubts in the flow, as I enter \"the zone\".\n\nHowever videos doesn't let me do that. Yes, I can pause it and look for it, but interrupts the flow.\nFor videos or audios to mimic a fraction of the Wiki's power, it has to be a well constructed and have a great pacing, wich nowadays is rare.\nShort videos are also good, but for short super specific things.",

Forcing yourself to learn things you don’t want(disinterests you, not necessarily because it’s hard) just burns you out. Learn things your pace. \n\nIf you feel like you’re not learning much, I recommend reading up different sort of technologies and forming up your own projects. These projects can then later on help you out on resumes and portfolios if you plan on landing a job in Computer Science.

Honestly this could just have to do with training data… there’s plenty of training data out there for lower level problems, but when compared to the sheer amount of data there is out there that surrounds major web frameworks it seems miniscule.\n\nThe optimist in me hopes that the abstraction AI is offering us will allow engineers to work on more complicated/interesting problems… as we’re already starting to see the curve start to flatten with actual LLM advancements in the context of code.",

Each language is designed with different tradeoffs for a different use case/purpose. C is an old language that's supposed to work close to the hardware. You have direct control of all the memory, and you don't pay for abstractions that you don't use. As a beginner programmer, you probably don't care about any of that unless your explicit goal is to use the language as a means to learn about what's going on at the hardware level. It sounds like you just want to build something cool. Languages like C# or python or javascript are much better suited to that purpose. Moreover, there is really no rule that you need to \"stick to a language\". Sure, if you're a professional with 10 YoE it makes sense to stick to your area of expertise, but besides that, you should feel free to oscillate between lots of languages whenever you want. Even single projects can combine multiple languages. You should think first about what you want to learn or build, and then work from there to what's a good language for that. You can learn the basics of a new language in like an hour, and you'll never truly master any language so don't even worry about that.",

As you noted the classic example is just adding up all the numbers in an array, where the \"somehow\" is the function: \\`return total\\_so\\_far + the\\_current\\_number\\` and the \"accumulation\" is a running total.\n\nA different example could be finding the max number in an array. It's not the fastest way to do it, but if you have an unordered array then you might provide the \"somehow\" as \\`return max(the\\_current\\_number, the\\_max\\_so\\_far)\\` then by the end the the\\_max\\_so\\_far variable has whatever the max value of the array is.\n\nOr you could have an ordered array of chapter objects that you want to output into a combined book, so the \"somehow\" is like \\`return book + this\\_chapter.to\\_s()\\`\n\nSo instead of a big ugly loop with temp variables you could just do \\`book\\_text = chapters.reduce(string.empty, (book, chapter) => book + chapter.to\\_s())\\`\n\n  \nTo be clear, as with basically everything in programming, you can of course do all this without \\`reduce()\\`, and you just have to choose based on clarity of intent whether to use it or not.",

Or I use AI to summarize something at the highest level and dig into the unfamiliar bits from there. Hardest part of learning something new for me is being overwhelmed by so much new stuff that I don't know where to start.\n\nAnyway, hopefully this explanation of reduce will help:\n\nSo you said you understand map and forEach? Perfect! You're close to understanding reduce because all 3 share one foundational behavior: Run a function on each item of the array.\n\nNow, here's how they differ:\n\nforEach: You want to just call the function for each item in the array. You don't necessarily want to do anything to the items or the array itself and you don't want to return anything.\n\nmap: You want to transform each item in the array into a new value. Example: You have an array with the values 1,2,3? Use map to transform the array into a new array with the values 2,4,6. The key here is your goal is to transform the original array into a new array with new items. The new array is an array of the same length as the original. Start with 3 items in your array? You'll end with 3 items in your new array.\n\nreduce: Similarly to map, your goal is to transform the array into something else. However, that something else can be anything! With map, you return a new array. With reduce, you return a new ANYTHING. You can turn the original array into an object (most common use case) or you can return a number, string, boolean, literally whatever you want. Example: Have an array of 1,2,3? Use reduce to return the sum of all numbers.",

        "body": ".reduce isn't easy to understand - it seems very counterintuitive, and the documentation is clearly written for someone with a different background than me :)\n\nMy suggestion for understanding it, and in general understanding complicated concepts, is to remember that everything in programming is invented to solve a problem - and that that problem could be solved before that thing was invented, just in a more complicated way!\n\nThat means that you can always write code that does the same as .reduce (or any other operation) - it will just be more convoluted.\n\nSo try to do that. Write a function to, I don't know, calculate the totalPrice of a list of Product objects, each with its own price ... Here's the solution, just so you know what I mean:\n\n    function calculateTotalPrice(products) {\n      let totalPrice = 0;\n      for(const product of products) {\n        totalPrice += product.price;\n      }\n      return totalPrice;\n    }\n\n  \nThen, when that works, write a more generic function, that doesn't know about product.price, but takes another function as a parameter, one that returns the value to add to the totalPrice. Meaning that this function should be able to calculate any total.\n\nAnd continue on to you have basically re-implemented .reduce with your own code.\n\nIt is important that you write it yourself, using your own thinking, and not get the solution from somewhere else, because it isn't about the solution, it is about the thinking that goes into it.\n\nThat is how I learned most of the array-functions (filter, map, etc.), coming from the old procedural way of thinking, I wrote my own implementation (with loads of bugs and imperfections) to understand what was going on.\n\n  \nAnd the benefit of using the builtin functions, is that other people know what they mean and can read it quickly, but having to understand someone elses implementation always requires having to read a lot of code, until you realize: ah, he's just reducing!",

So as much as like the command-line and keybinds, I prefer the more visual approach, where I can swap over to the mouse at certain times (for for certain workflows). I prefer VSCode (even though I program on Linux).\n\nThat said, you can use Vim keybinds (and custom keybinds) in VSCode, and you can use VSCode keybinds in Vim.\n\nOverall, I'd argue that Vim will slow you down (at least at first), and you're better off trying it out later when you have some more experience under your belt. With Vim, once you get a grasp on everything you're doing, all of your macros, and map all of your keybinds perfectly... you'll be blazing fast. Editing code, refactoring code, and navigating between functions, files, and folders will be instant. But getting there is HARD and, debatably, acute speed isn't a huge priority when it comes to writing code, or writing quality code.\n\nI'd say, in regards to people I've worked with who use Vim, they're typically \"not faster than me at all\" or they're something like \"10% faster than me at best\". There's always the rare exception, the sweaty nerd who's so good at Vim that they're flying through code and edits at light speed, but they're rare, and I'd suggest that \"it has more to do with them\" than it does \"Vim\".

First, there's those that are being forced to get a tutor because they are struggling. Maybe parents are pushing them. This can also work the other way where parents are trying to get their kids ahead. Second would be an older learner who just wants to get started. They are likely more motivated.\n\nThe difficulty in tutoring is whether students want you to do their homework for them, or do their projects for them. This is cheating. If you don't want to facilitate that, you should indicate that ahead of time.\n\nFor example, you can explain a scenario to the student where you say \"If you say to me 'I have to turn in this programming assignment by tomorrow, or I'll get a zero, and I've barely started!', I'm going to tell you, no, I don't do that. You should plan ahead on your assignments and not rely on me to do them for you.\"\n\nSetting expectations is something you should do.\n\nYou learn to teach as you go along, so what works for one student might not work for another.",

The latter, typically older students, feel that a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies of a subject hinders their ability to tackle practical applications. Personally, I strive to strike a balance between these two approaches for each student, ensuring that they acquire a fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms rather than merely memorizing random words that magically work on their computers, browsers, or phones.",

I would think a theorist wants to know more of the theory, unless what you're saying is they DO think this way, but know that they ALSO need to think practically and therefore want a tutor.\n\nDoes that mean you don't have students who know a lot of practical stuff, but don't know much theory like a CS student would (or should).",

Classes, modules, folders, packages, microservices, clusters are just different ways of organizing functions. The bad architect (let's call them John) looks towards options higher up in that list, when putting a bunch of files into a well-named folder would be just as clean.\n2. Functions with side-effects need special attention: A pure function will rarely cause scalability issues, a function that upserts into a database will. Learning to segregate side effects is a skill that takes a lifetime to learn, but it really helps if you don't have to use @Transcational 8 times during a HTTP request's execution. The other day I sped up a messy procedure by 500% just by moving all db lookups to one place and parallelizing them, John would have held architecture meetings for the next half year to make the service with 20 monthly users \"multi-instance ready\" instead of identifying the bottleneck.\n3. Bounded-everything. To know how much scale you need, know how many resources you need. That's easy when you write code that needs a fixed amount of RAM, or that runs in a fixed amount of time. John does `database.readAll()` until one day the server crashes, and he gets pat on the back when he fixes the issue after a two-day outage. (Turns out the service was not multi-instance ready and they all crashed)\n4. Distributed systems are HARD. People love to add microservices willy nilly because it looks cool in the diagrams, but just really try to avoid it. I usually play devils advocate for just making a big monolith. Stick to conway's law, that's fine, but NO JOHN WE DO NOT NEED 11 FUNCTION APPS WITH 300LOC EACH JUST BECAUSE YOU READ ABOUT THE ADAPTER PATTERN AND KAFKA IN SOME BOOK.

Now this is a broad model of how a ui program works, there are many other paradigms used, however in event driven architectures it can mostly be boiled down to mvc or model view control.  \n\nWith games or any ui program with a simulation info does kind of loop in the simulation/model. But this still doesn't really break the previous statement, how paradox games work is in the event handling side of things it is basically 2 steps repeated over and over: get players input then compute new state, when one of the players is lagging what happens is its basically blocking on the get players input stage, the simulation doesn't look at real time it looks at simulations slices (ticks), and so to the simulation everything comes in at the same time, but at the get players input we know that isn't true. Typically the lag will come from one player not verifying the previous simulation slice fast enough.",

Instead the game just runs slower and it takes longer to pass time in the game. Rimworld has a similar system where it aims for a set tick amount per second and throttles to a slower tick speed to try and prevent lag by slowing the game down.\n\nLets say your cpu can handle 100 calculations per tick. In essence what happens is if over the course of the game you go from 100 calculations per tick up to 1000 calculations per tick over the course of a game, then the tick speed will get 10x slower by the end and you shouldn't in theory see your computer drop below 60 fps",

I assume this is bc the CPU usage is wildly inconsistent second to second due to a possible lack of  multi threading engine architecture, so the games frequently max out cpu usage at 100%. This is why the lag can sometimes disappear when lowering game speed by one level even though tick speed didn't change.\n\nRimWorld does not have this problem in my experience and only really experiences lag from running out of memory (or poorly optimized mods).",

        "body": "Recently I freelanced for a UI-focused company, and I picked up some interesting practices from how they structure their frontend work. They use Tailwind for styling and Next.js for everything else. Here’s a breakdown of their approach:\n\n\n**Start with a clear theme**\n\nThey rely on design tokens to keep things simple and consistent across the UI. It helps centralize color, spacing, and typography decisions early on.\n\n\n**Component architecture: two clear categories**\n\n- Templates:\nThese are dumb components. They just display what’s passed in via props. No state, no logic. In Next.js, these are implemented as server components.\n\n- Traditional components:\nThese do the heavy lifting: handle state, run computations, etc. They render templates and manage the layout. \n\n- \n\n\n**Avoid prop drilling by leaning into composition**\n\nMost components accept a children prop. That, combined with smart layout components, makes it easy to nest and compose without passing props down five layers.\n\n\n**Type safety everywhere**\n\nThey use TypeScript, and schemas are defined using Zod.\nTypes are derived from the Zod schemas, so you get strong typing and runtime validation in one go.\n\n\n**Always validate backend data**\n\nFirst thing they do with any data from the backend: run it through Zod. If it doesn’t match the schema, it gets rejected. This protects the app from unexpected API changes or malformed data.\n\n\n**Some of my own preferences that I mix in:**\n\n- For complex state, I like using a reducer. It can grow big, but having all actions in one place keeps things maintainable. Plus, reducers are easy to unit test.\n\n- For simple state, I lean on signals (when available). They’re lightweight and reactive, perfect for local UI state.\n\n- I’ve also grown to like the “crash fast” philosophy: use assertions to catch incorrect assumptions early. If something is wrong, I’d rather have it fail immediately than cause weird bugs later.",

Once they do that, the accounts `confirmed` flag is changed to `true`. To make this better, the confirmation code (which may be part of the confirmation link), can be stored in a table linked to the account with a set timeout.\n\nThis is the account verification process.\n\nThe password rest works in a similar way. When a user clicks the \"forgot password\" link, an Email with a reset-link / code is sent out. The code is stored in a reset database, with the record linking code and account id and having a timeout. If the user enters the code they got sent, they are redirected to a config page where they can change their password.\n\nThis is the password reset process.\n\nBoth of these processes rely on the assumption, that the user has sole control over the Email account.",

Motivation can make a big difference. But in general, it isn't necessarily an easy career to get into, and while it is well-paid once you get in it isn't easy money either. Very much like being an engineer or an architect. If you've got the aptitude, it is a solid career, but it isn't worth pursing \"just to get a job\" type of a thing.\n\nIf you're just looking for a job to improve your financial stituation, you might want to consider jobs that are a little less competitive, require a bit less learning, but still pay well. Everyone says \"HVAC technician\" but I don't know how true that actually is. I've got a bunch of family members who are electricians though, and they've always done pretty well. If you can handle bodily fluids, nursing is always in demand. I think the best balance between job security and decent pay is to get into a field that requires both brains and physical presence on site - needing to do some schooling to get in filters out the applicant pool some and drives wages up, but needing to actually be there to work with your hands/body means you're way less vulnerable to automation or being off-shored.",

But in all honesty this is not the path for you.\n\n1) It is a VERY competitive field. If you're struggling to learn the absolute basics you are going to drown here.\n\n2) It requires good social skills as much as anything else. Developer jobs are not Hollywood cases of a dude in a basement. You need to be engaged with the business. Able to drive conversations about needs and requirements. To provide feedback etc. So do not go down this route thinking that it is some easy path in that regard.\n\nThere are many paths in life. Dev is not for everyone, and if we take your comments here at face value then it is not for you. Have a look at what options there are that better suit your interests. Regardless you will have to develop your social skills. There is pretty much zero exception there, so if I were you I would work on addressing those first.\n\nThen start exploring options. Careers are hard because often we don't know what we don't know. Which leads people to aim for the high profile stuff like software div / engineer / lawyer. But there are MANY other options out there.",

Internally there's very little travel and expenses budgets, morale events are gone and often paid by managers, no free food or snacks, the equipment is cheap, internal IT is garbage tier, we had to fight to get replacement computers. Also, those bonuses were structured in a way to be weaponized. You NEVER hit max bonus and more often hit midpoint or less if the manager just disliked you.\n\n\nPeople like to joke about Amazon's \"frugality\" leadership principle. But there's a difference between the definition of frugal (pay for just enough) and Microsoft's cheapness.\n\nEdit: Let me add one more cheap thing. Microsoft just had their 50th Anniversary. I would say that's quite a milestone for a big company, right? Let's just say when Windows 11 came out, we all got to pick out pretty fantastic goodies (sweaters, premium jackets, memorabilia's, etc.). For the 50th...I got to pick out a Teams background. And watch 3 CEOs pat each other on the back. Oh, and more copilot features (internal copilot is garbage tier and extremely watered down).",

        "body": "Investors want profit, which is revenue minus costs. Software needs developers, which are expensive. The big promise of AI is to drastically slash software development costs. There are a couple of ways for doing that:\n\n* By allowing less skilled folks to create good-enough software without having to pay experienced developers. Here, AI tools compete with the low-code/no-code industry. Nothing new.\n* By making good developers more productive. This is where AI-based code completion comes in.\n* By having the AI system independently solve high-level tasks. This is the dream of “agentic AI”.\n\nIt doesn't matter for AI companies if there will be fewer mid-skilled developers buying their subscriptions. A client company wants to get some amount of software development done. In theory, it can achieve this by some mix of humans and AI tools. Choosing some amount of AI is an economic win-win situation if AI-productivity is more cost-effective than human-productivity. But this means the price cap of an AI tool subscription isn't hundreds of dollars per month, but whatever it would cost to hire another human developer. And good developers are quite expensive.\n\nNow the neat thing for AI companies is that they don't have to realize these productivity gains themselves. They just have to convince other businesses that there *could* be productivity gains using these tools, that everyone else is doing it, and that your investors will start asking questions if you don't also jump on the hype train.\n\nIn a gold rush, sell shovels.\n\nThe problem here is that AI tools aren't cost-effective (yet). They are generally not cost-effective for users due to quite uneven quality, and they're not sold at-cost by the tool providers, because GPUs are so dang expensive. Currently, the field is propelled by the belief that the economics will work out soon™.\n\nPersonally, I'm fairly relaxed about this. AI-written code is generally well below my skill-level (especially when taking architecture and design concerns into account), and I don't see a plausible path for AI to catch up. Ever-bigger models with ever-larger context windows cost exponentially more, which could mean that the productivity:cost break-even point for high-skill activities like software development is never reached before the tool providers go bankrupt. There are also systematic problems, like software projects having a lot of implicit and oral context that is not available to an LLM.\n\nAI is probably here to stay, but software developers are some of the last folks who have to worry about this.",

An extra 30k/yr snowballing into 1k/mo or whatever in capital growth after 10 years is not nothing. There's a world of difference between having a chill/boring job vs not having to have a job in the first place, and with the high pay ceilings in this profession, the latter is reasonably achievable.",

Stagnating is a great way to jeopardize your financial future. You stay at the $170K company with a chill job, you don't keep advancing in your career, and then in 10 years when the company decides to lay you off... now what? Recruiters want to see growth, and you will just be able to say \"I've been in the same spot for like 10 years\". Especially in an ageist industry that evolves quickly, you really don't want to find yourself obsolete at 40.\n\n2. Inflation. When I graduated college 20 years ago, $100K was a lot of money. Now you need $160K to have the purchasing power that $100K did back then. So if inflation is going up higher than your salary (which is likely if you don't seek advancement opportunities), you might gradually lose purchasing power - and pretty substantially.\n\n3. Even with lifestyle creep, you will often find yourself accumulating wealth in other ways as your salary goes up. Bigger 401K, the bigger house you bought gets a bunch of equity + appreciation in it, etc.\n\n4. Accumulating extra experience early can actually land you in better work life balance later. Which, let me tell you - I'm happy to have the good work life balance at 40 (when I'm tired and have kids) than at 26 (when I had way more energy and no kids to worry about)",

H1b really breaks those.\n\nAlso the US never had talent shortages in industry or academia until these visa programs screwed up labor conditions and wages...\n\nEven Elon has talked about how talented Americans avoid actual stem careers and go into finance and other industries bc STEM is unappealing (which I'd argue is because of the wage and working perversion by these visa programs.)\n\n[How and Why Government, Universities and Industry Create 'Labor Shortages' of Skilled Americans](https://www.ineteconomics.org/uploads/papers/Weinstein-GUI_NSF_SG_Complete_INET.pdf)\n\nYou can look at what chinese software engineers make in an actual free market which is not oursourced or perverted by visa immigration.

The other thing you can do is build your own projects to demonstrate you can build new things from scratch. Start simple, build a blog, add comments, add the ability to subscribe via email, tie it in to a content-management system - Lotta places need blogs. Once that's done, chronical your open source contributions & post tech-related content on there. There's a certain \"man's is published, he knows what he's doing\" energy from having a nice blog.\n\nEssentially the goal is to build a sufficiently impressive portfolio that you have *something* to put on a resume & something to talk about in an interview. A nice plus is if your projects make money - could be a small amount, even just $1-5 / month is noteworthy. \n\nA lot of people are giving you shit - but we all started from nothing at some point, it might take 6-12 months for you to build a sufficiently impressive portfolio that it lands you a job - but a year from now is a year from now regardless of what you do now.

Some may be lucky enough to find another role internally, but losing your job hurts and is a very stressful time.\n\nA silver lining perhaps is that these losses seem to be Seattle-focused. If laid-off, being in Seattle and a current employee will almost certainly put you at the top of the list for hiring, in the area where the most jobs are.\n\nWhat I'll also add is that it's worth noting where these layoffs have occurred. Devices is a huge org, but many of the divisions are ones where new products were recently launched or are due to be launched. That's not a great look for Amazon, especially if the new versions of Alexa, Zoox, or Kuiper start to suffer issues. It's equally a really shitty look internally if these are successful - why the fuck would you work hard to make something a success when your payoff is losing your job?",

It's like an intern that's overly confident, speaks in a way that's trustworthy and sounds competent, *and* he just took a bunch of acid and is hallucinating half the time, and isn't testing their own work and just submitting shit on blind faith that it works.\n\nWe actually had a couple training sessions recently at my company from a guy at Microsoft regarding Copilot. One thing he continuously emphasized is that it's a *copilot*. We are still the pilots. He himself said that the most dangerous thing about Copilot, and the biggest disasters he's seen, are people that trust it. Copilot is a tool that can help us quickly get through mundane tasks. It is not a resource that can be used to blindly generate code we ship to production. *The creators* are telling us that it should not be used for blind code generation. That's telling.\n\nA funny thing about those trainings that I noticed is that the instructor himself struggled a lot during all his demos because the AI wouldn't co-operate, and he had to live debug why things weren't working the way he wanted. It's very telling when a *live demo to a major customer* goes haywire.\n\nI use AI the exact same way I use StackOverflow. It's a tool to get me information, or get quick answers to mundane tasks. It's *not* something I just copy/paste. It *augments* my abilities, it doesn't generate my code. It's just a faster Google, and Google/StackOverflow results also need to be taken with a big ass grain of salt.",

Now apply the exemplar pattern to feature B,\"\n\n\nAnd it would do a good job of correctly implementing the pattern and saved a substantial amount of time. It'd get things wrong here and there and always needed a clean up, but overall it did about as well as a decent intern.\n\n\nAnd then I started giving a little more latitude. I wrote out a requirements document for a new feature, got it to analyze the code base again, feed it the requirements document and worked through it with it.\n\n\nIt did a reasonable job of putting together code that met the requirements. I did catch it trying to cheat on the unit tests, very badly. Something it definitely learnt from the unit tests in its training data. It did hallucinate a few things and left some half implemented code it had started and then deserted lying around. The worst thing I caught it doing was going of and off and making changes to completely unrelated code that would've broken things.\nBut overall, it's output was mediocre AF. It was messy, convoluted, had nonsensical functions it had added and forgotten about, barely conformed to the patterns required.\n\n\nSo next session, I loaded it up and ask it to review the code base, it does so and comes back with \"Areas of the code are well designed and implemented, with clean code and adheres to best practices, but feature XYZ contains numerous errors, technical debt and fails to meet the same stand as the rest of the code\". Feature XYZ was the feature I'd asked it to implement. So at least it was able to identify that it's output was garbage. I did let it have a go at clean up it's mess, but it just made it worse to the point I had to roll back all the changes fir the session and then went and cleaned it up myself. So no time was saved that day.\n\n\nSo lesson here is, just like with juniors, if you give it a well crafted exemplar to learn from, it'll do an acceptable job of implementing code  based on that. But, just like with juniors, if you give it a requirements document and turn it loose on a new feature, it'll get the job mostly done, but it'll be ugly as all hell and need a fair bit of work to get it over the line.\n\n\nBut where the junior wins out is in when you send the work back, show them the exemplar and get them to rework things, the junior won't usually make things worse.",

And also they know the products are going to be absolutely garbage but they do not give a fuck as long as they have that multi year contract linked.\n\nThey set up deals like a house if cards, demand massive bonuses, pay PR firms to fluff their profiles, then bounce before it all comes down.

Don't look up the answer until you finish the timer. Every single time you fail to solve a problem, work aggressively to ameliorate your weaknesses. \n- come up with a methodical problem solving process. Don't just change things and run them praying it works, get good at thinking about what you're going to do to your program and similating the output before even typing. Get good at running your own test cases against your code in your head rather than relying on printf debugging\n- get as many swe interviewers you can to give you mock interviews and giving you mock interviews\n- fill any gaps in your text stack that you may have (frontend should be angular, react, nextjs and typescript, backend should be Java , spring boot, postgres, mongo, redis)\n- brush up on AWS knowledge of core services including networking, security and databases, \n-  build example projects that actually work and document them very well on your GitHub and publish live links to your portfolio site and GitHub. This is a good chance to combine both stack knowledge gaps and AWS knowledge gaps all in one shot\n- create a portfolio site\n\nSomewhere in the middle of the above after some leetcode and projects are under your belt:\n- dont be as stringent about pay\n- expand the set of rules you're searching for (i.e. SWE, SDE, SDET, full stack, backend, frontend, SRE, ops, devops, etc...)\n-  be willing to relocate\n- get as many swe interviewers reading your resume as you can\n- ensure your indeed, LinkedIn and resume are fully beefed up and peer-reviewed\n- don't just cold apply. That's completely useless. Cold message recruiters, hiring managers, team members, random recruiters / hiring managers on LinkedIn, connect with family members, old colleagues, old peers, anyone and everyone. Don't seem too desperate, don't ask strangers for referrals. \n- always smile, be punctual, dress appropriately, take your time, make the interviewers feel comfortable like it's a conversation and not an interview, show no ego whatsoever, appear extremely eager to learn, admit when you don't know something rather than guess and embarrass yourself, have a list of thought provoking and insightful questions to dazzle interviewers, and AGGRESSIVELY ask for feedback and FERVENTLY correct all of your mistakes every single interview, after enough interviews there will be no more mistakes left. \n\nMost importantly...\n- keep your head up, realize that if you keep trusting in the process you will come out ahead. Don't doom yourself, if you get rejected sometimes it has nothing to do with what you did and is out of your control, and lastly, JUST KEEP BUILDING LEARNING AND GROWING!!! EVERY DAY!!",

If a company needs to cut corners or decides to move positions offshore, there isn't much you can do about it.  You could have been picked due to performance, salary, age, likability.

Don't take time off to lick your wounds.  That will only put you behind.  Job hunting is your full-time job now.  Do all of the things you hear about such as formatting your resume and cover letters for each application.  ChatGPT and Grok make it easy.  It's a stupid game that we all have to play now.  I've had recruiters admit that they only look at the top 3-5 resumes that some AI spits out to them after receiving hundreds.\n\nKeep a log of who you apply to so you have the info handy when a company contacts you 6 weeks later saying your resume impressed them and you have no idea who they are or the position you applied to.  OneNote is great for this.  It also makes it easy and organized to fill out unemployment claims.\n\nStart being frugal with your money now.  Life is expensive and your savings will go fast.\n\nBiggest thing is stay positive.  Looking for a job when you are unemployed is a grueling process and it's easy to get depressed.

I am dealing with a very tricky health issue, get an appointment at our renowned medical school, only to find out I'll be seen by a NP (nurse practitioner). Not very confidence inspiring never mind my primary care provider is an NP or as my kid calls them, a noctor /s but it's the reality of where healthcare is going (i work software for a large healthcare administration company). \n\nThird, i get the meaningful part. Having worked in the automotive industry for three decades i had the same desire. It does feel meaningful to see your stuff in action.\n\nHaving said all that, I'd say try big pharma, some health tech, and medical devices companies. Or any embedded really, automotive or aerospace. My partner worked 15 years in big pharma manufacturing. Her software helped make many very popular meds. But if you're in a position where a physician salary will be a paycut for you none of the above pay remotely that.",

Goobie (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25LUF8GmbFU). to summarize, although medicine is can save the lives of many patients, medicine can only do so much saving and the other form of relief also comes from the patient's own habits and behavior. if you believe that your role as a doctor is to guide and fix (realizing that not all problems can be fixed), and this matters to you, then medicine isn't a bad idea in this aspect.\n\nalso, if you don't mind me asking, how did you become both a premed and CS major in college? that sounds like something i'll be interested in",

Products that were enshittified hard will get eaten by competitors offering something better.  Also overall, the way companies treat their staff will encourage employees to be a lot more mercenary with employers.\n\nWe’ve seen all that before after tech recessions.\n\nBut as for the MBA class… I hate to tell you this, but they basically never suffer personal consequences for their actions.  They pull out the “served our shareholders” card or claim their actions were responding to industry trends etc. \n\n There is no functional mechanism that holds executives accountable for what they do, once a company hits a certain size… and scum always floats to the top.",

It is your responsibility as the senior reviewing PRs to provide feedback to the person making the pull request that enables them to address your concerns with their code.\n\nOP, your issue here is that Mr.Newbie isn't pulling from your developer branch to merge the latest set of already merged code into their code, assuming your org is using *proper* version control guidelines of developers having personal branches per story, the team having a dev branch for every sprint and PRing work from the stories to the dev branch, then the dev branch to the main demo branch, then the demo branch to the production branch for use by the users. If your org is managing branches properly, the issue here is that Mr.Newbie wasn't pulling from the developer branch before PR'ing their branch to the dev branch. These conflicts tend to happen when multiple people are working on the same file. If anything, your frustration at this common inconvenience is itself indicative of a relative lack of experience working with version control in a group setting. **Try to be understanding of what it is like to be inexperienced with unfamiliar tools and a good mentor for the newhire.** Everyone is new to these tools at some point in their career, even you.\n\nOnce you are both pulling from dev before PRing to dev, you'll have to *intelligently handle any merging conflicts on your local build***, so be sure to push your changes before pulling to ensure you don't lose any work if you make a mistake.** Try to become a mentor for the newhire and retain a positive attitude about the team expanding. You should make an effort to find ways to gain visibility for your mentorship and beat the drum of how much progress you've made with training the newhire to resolve these issues during your scrums so that you get credit for the effort.\n\n  \nTbh, just showing up to work being able to explain that fairly basic solution to your org's problem and pitch the answer to it to your team ought to resolve the issue and make yourself seem rather knowledgeable in your next meeting.

If they're accessing this information after you already accepted an offer, there's really not a lot of malicious things they can do with your work history as long as that history isn't noteworthy - like, if you've had standard jobs, those are the jobs listed on your resume, and you've had reasonable salary progression along the way.\n\nBut if you don't fall in that category, you should be very careful with this info. Things that immediately come to mind:\n\n* If you \"embelished\" or straight up lied about your current compensation during salary negotiations. Like, if you said you were making $200K and they used that info to offer you $240K and then they find out you're actually making $150K, that could have negative repercussions\n* If you had any jobs that you didn't put on your resume that you might not want them to see - like, if you said you had an employment gap but were actually doing work for a somewhat controversial company. Or if you lied about having a job or how long you were there.\n* As OP said - union membership, reason for termination, etc. I feel like those are all touchy subjects that could have repercussions.\n\nAll that to say - I think for a lot of people, this doesn't really matter that much. But you probaby should look at it and figure out if it does - especially if something in there is wrong.",

Your company has an information/support problem. Because there's no documentation, or proper support, or any sort of information distribution to the rest of the company, you're getting pinged constantly. You're being pulled into meetings that don't actually need you, just because ***you're*** the documentation. They want you there just in case. Going into a meeting without you would be like trying to code without Google. When people run into issues they ping you because ***you're Google***.\n\nYou can fix that. Just setting up a random Teams channel and telling them to send their questions there is a start, but it's not enough. Also, it's useless if you keep answering direct-pings. If you get direct pings, politely redirect them to the dev channel. You don't need to come off as if you're avoiding helping them, you can hide it under the guise of \"visibility\" to others.\n\nBut the \"Go-To Person\" at a company that *doesn't* suffer from that is the person management comes to when they need to *get shit done*. They aren't going to waste your talents asnwering stupid questions in a support channel. When there's some really hard task that *needs* to be done fast, and right the first time, they point immediately at the \"Go-To Person\", they don't want to risk giving that ticket to anyone else in the team. You're the tool they use when they don't have any margin for error, because they know you don't need any.\n\n*That's* my experience as the \"Go-To Person\". I always naturally fall into that role, and its great. I've done some awesome things, I've pulled some miracles, I get interesting work, I have the trust of my management.

The interview process was generally:\n\n* HR Intro Call\n* 1 hour Hiring Manager / Tech Screen\n* On-site panel interview for 2 hours / 2 interviews 1-on-1 with a SWE lasting about 1 hour each\n\nFrankly it's harder to get an offer now, because companies are more picky.  They are scared to death of a false positive hire and will sacrifice the false negative hire all day every day.  I personally think there are tons of talent out there that with some ramp up time on the job would be an excellent SWE.\n\nEvery company I have worked for over my 15 YOE never really had issues hiring once candidates applied. Granted these were non-tech companies in non-tech cities so they were not hiring out of the same pool of candidates as bit tech companies.  If you could do reverse a string level problems with C or C++ you would get an offer. \n\nThese companies were fine with ramp up time and showing candidates, at all levels, what they needed to know to do the job.  Just finding people that had an aptitude for being a SWE was the problem. Aptitude does not mean some rock star coder, but could wrap their head around concepts when shown to them.\n\nGranted I've never applied to a startup, so maybe that world is different.",

        "body": "It is much more a consequence of the company values.\n\nBad work culture and bad work/life balance aren't the same thing than having high operational target metrics.\n\nAmazon has an intentional culture of employees being always working, always tethered to operations, and committing to die at the job. They make you feel bad for taking more than a week of vacation in a year of 12 hours work days. That's more a correlation than a causation but Bezos doesn't see it that way and since he's writing the checks, that's how it works. This is not specific to AWS and affects other areas at Amazon which are less tied to operations. Regardless they built the narrative that such shitty conditions are simply the result of the nature of the job, that if you're not always on the edge of burnout, the business will crumble and the competition will overtake them. Most people have known nothing else so they believe it.\n\nOther sectors and countries have laws so that demanding jobs don't ruin the life of people. For obvious reasons, truckers cannot drive more than X hours per day. Airline pilots must observe rest times, etc. Because obviously pushing these limits isn't good. It doesn't mean we can't have trucks and airplanes, it means we had to find ways to make it work and compensate for the demanding conditions of such jobs, often in the form of regulations against abuses. Companies still find ways to be competitive.\n\nIn some other countries if you are on-duty you need to be compensated for that even if the pager doesn't ring. Being available for the job is considered a work related duty so it needs to be compensated. If you join the call for an incident the law requires the employer to clock hours in addition to your regular pay -- even if you're not an hourly employee. On holidays you get up to double pay. And their online services aren't more or less reliable.\n\nThe US tech has close to no worker protection laws so the only things that retains companies to crush employees is how long they want to keep them and how easily they can find a job elsewhere. That somewhat works if the job market is balanced and companies are compelled to watch wlb to be attractive. This is often made easier by the general American narrative that government is a bad thing, that politics are here to trick us not to protect us, so employees hope for their company to do the right thing by themselves and rarely think about forms of civil action.",

If it’s not mitigated every 15 minutes passed it will page the next in line, so an issue that has been going for an hour would have the VP and like 20 other on call engineers getting yelled at trying to mitigate the issue. By the way that happened every other day, and when that’s not happening you’re resolving tickets of minor issues.

It's only a matter of time.\n\nWith that knowledge, I hold onto a good WLB for as long as it stays good. I have no interest in job hopping just to make some more money, I already make plenty. When the WLB is good, I couldn't care less if I'm underpaid. I know full well those small 1-5% annual raises don't keep me up with the market, and I'm perfectly OK with that. Once the WLB changes for the worse, and I'm *forced* to job hop is when I'll get the nice salary bump to be re-adjusted to market rate.\n\n$40k-$55k extra wouldn't make me consider leaving an otherwise good gig for even a moment. Irrespective of market, but it's doubly true in bad markets. If we're talking about $40k to $80k it'd be a different conversation, but $110k to $150k wouldn't cause me to jump ship.\n\nThat's just me though. These are *my* priorities, and *my* goals in life. My answer only makes sense in that context. Someone that's foused on grinding money would think I'm crazy, and in their world, I am. Different strokes.\n\nThink about what's important to *you*.",

No job is perfectly secure. Lots of people who were working for the government, gov. contractors, and research institutions who thought they would have a job forever are now looking. The best job security is the kind you make yourself, by having a diverse skillset and a wide reaching network. Working at different places is the easiest way to do that. \n\n3. there’s absolutely no harm in submitting some resumes and taking a few interviews. You’re actually in the best possible position. You don’t need a job right now, you have one that you like and could stay at. You’re not in any hurry. Only apply for jobs here and there that seem very interesting to you, that meet your preferences (remote, etc.). If you do a couple interviews and git a whiff of bad WLB, bail.

A couple years later, that open source project got me scouted into a big tech company for another 150% increase. My pay at this company more than doubled in the 8 years I've been there.

I made good money but it was stressful and I lost my job due to the high expectations and me not meeting it. Sometimes the fast paced job is not all that it seems. \n\nIf you are happy with the money you make, the company culture, etc. It's ok not being the guy who is always innovative and working on things that change the world. We are told from the second we decide to be engineers that we need to work on things that change the world and when we are stagnant we feel like we are \"stealing money\". \n\nStaying at this company can increase job security too. Im sure many people your age are job-hopping to more money but more stressful jobs. Your company may appreciate how you stayed, give you huge promotions and when it comes down to layoffs they wont consider laying off a person who has been there 10+ years and knows the system and someone who everybody loves. \n\nTo see the other side of the coin, it is completely fine being the person who wants to work extra create innovative code, etc. All i say is dont do it because you are under this impression SWEs need to be on the go all the time.",

Think about the people, processes, and the exchange between different teams that you noticed. \n\n\n\nOnly four months in a job is a speed bump at the very beginning of your career.

I had trouble finding work recently and hooked up with a firm that got me placed at a company that I couldn’t secure and interview for directly.

Make it known internally you want some growth on that side. If you’re currently unemployed, it’ll be an uphill battle for sure. It’s doable in a good job market if you tailor your resume to talk about how you worked cross functionally, gathered requirements, etc but as it stands now you’re competing against people who actually have that experience - these roles are not just BS office job stuff.\n\nCompletely different set of skills that are required",

AI, no AI, it doesn't matter, the buck has to stop with someone, and that's a variety of managers.\n\nI do think there is truth to your statement, though. At least at my company, we have no team level managers. I run a team, and I'm a senior engineer. The next layer of management is on the \"team of teams\" level. I do like this, and although a lot of project/product management falls on me when it comes to planning and execution, it's a lot easier when the managers just trust me on the technical details, empower me with a team to get the job done and the right set of people to answer my questions, and just step back and let me do my thing.\n\nIn my role, the managers just worry about goals, and how we allocate resources to go achieve them. For me, that's easy to deal with: everything we do must be towards some goal, I can get that done with the team, and management makes sure that impact/effort ratio remains high.\n\nAfter all, what I want for everyone on my team is to have a good, impactful review period which translates into good reviews. Instead of fighting management, I get a lot further by thinking of them as partners in the process, where trust is a two way street, and we are on the same team. Maybe that's niave, but the only way to be trusted to build anything significant, or lead, is to have a manager agree to the spend.",

It sucks, yes, but that's just how it is.\n\nI can't tell you what you should learn. You have the skills to figure that out yourself. Look at Stackoverflow's yearly survey and see what people use. Google around a bit. Look at job postings to see what technologies are in demand. Pick something to learn based on what interests you and what seems relevant to you.\n\nAlso, it was due to stagnation that I left my first job, and I have never looked back.",

You could also try asking some questions about their expectations for your development (no pun intended) and how they plan to support your growth into a full-time dev role.\n\nOne thing that helped me when I was in a similar spot was using this AI tool that listens to interview questions and provides suggested responses in real time. If you're interested, I can share it with you.\n\nRemember that everyone starts somewhere, and the most important thing is that you have a clear understanding of your strengths and weaknesses, as well as what you're looking for in a role.

        "body": "So, I'm 5 years deep into my career, which I hope gives me a good amount of perspective without being grizzled and jaded. Most of it was as a developer at a boutique consulting firm, and I stuck with the same client for about 3 years, a large at home healthcare company. Then bounced around other clients for a little over a year before we had a bad quarter and a headcount reduction. I got another job within the month building business software at a major auto manufacturer. \n\nAll that said, here's something I wish I knew 5 years ago. \n\nThe technical stuff, coding, architecture, deployments, are NOT the toughest part of the job. There's a good chance that coding is the easiest part of your work. It's working with and meeting the often inconsistent expectations of clients, product managers, stakeholders, and business analysts that will make your job hard. But, the good thing about that, is the better you learn to understand these people's perspectives and speak their language instead of nerd gibberish, you will be so much more valuable to your team. It's one thing to be a good coder, but when you're a good coder who can get the non-technical decision makers on your side, you become the person who GETS THINGS DONE. \n\nI inherited my current position from someone who was a good developer, but a really poor communicator. He didn't set expectations and just said whatever he needed to so people would stop asking him to explain. He developed a notorious reputation in the other departments as someone who didn't make sense and couldn't deliver. The tough part was he actually was a good developer, but people who didn't trust him tried to get in his way. \n\nLong story short, even though you're a developer, educate yourself in the business as a whole. Ask people from other departments about what they do and what their pain points are. Take their perspectives into account when it's appropriate and let them know that you're doing that (in a humble way, of course). You'll be an asset to the company as a whole and unique opportunities may open up.",

If you don't know something, anything that you don't know how to do/don't get/understand, ask for help. Do a bit of research first but do not spend more than an hour. If you are clueless on something even after an hour, just ask for help\n\n\\- When you have learned something new, take notes on it\n\n\\- Work on challenging tickets. It's the best way to learn things quickly\n\n\\- If you are working with a tech stack/tools you are not familiar with/you are new to it, work on a project that uses the tech stack/tools\n\n\\- Before you do something like make a PR for instance, ask what the company's convention/process is. Sometimes they may want you to write a PR in a certain way as an example. This goes for documentation, git commits, code as well. Pretty much anything where you need to do something for the company\n\n\\- Don't focus so much on documenting things when you are working on a ticket. Document for you, not for the company. But if the senior dev asks you to document something, then document. E.g., say you are working on something new, don't spend so much time neatly documenting an activity diagram or a sequence diagram. Focus on the dev work. If the company wants you to create a documentation, then document it. Not all documentation are useful for the company\n\n\\- Don't share anything personal/personal life issues. Colleagues may form negative opinions about you. This is like fitting into the company politics, if you don't fit, then you may be seen undesirable from a social point of view. Just keep it positive and professional\n\n\\- Company may have certain events or even activities like weekly soccer or board games. They may even have an internal committee where they are responsible for holding team related events/activities. Join them to maintain and improve relationships with the people in your company\n\n\\- At least when I did my internship, they valued efficiency. If you can complete work quickly and if you are able to take on work quickly, you will be seen as a highly valuable employee, you will get promoted easily\n\nThat's all I can think of right now, I may add more if I can think of anything else.",

You don't have to hide it, my manager and skip understood this was life changing money and would open up lots of opportunities for my career.  We had a farewell party and everything was fine. You are way too worried about this, any reasonable person would be happy for you.",

One thing I learned is that companies often like to avoid former entrepreneurs, they see them as flight risks or otherwise as \"bad fits\". Then add a bit of ageism into the mix to make it nastier.\n\nWithout crossing ethical or legal boundaries, I wonder if you could somehow rephrase \"Founder\" into something that sounds closer to a cog-in-the-machine role, such as \"E-commerce Technologist\".\n\nMaybe someone with more direct experience in CS can comment on this point, but anecdotally I've seen former founders/entrepreneurs experiment with this tactic and they did see results. \n\nI'm in the U.S, so there may be cultural or systemic differences to consider as well.",

They cover a lot of the same ground as LeetCode problems but in a more theoretical sense. As for actual practice, start by trying to design a simple system like a blog comment section or a user authentication system - it'll help you get your feet wet with thinking through scalability and performance.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper, I've used an AI tool that listens to system design interview questions and suggests responses in real time. If you're interested, I can share it with you. Keep at it, and don't worry if it takes a few weeks or even months to get the hang of it - the more you practice, the better you'll understand these concepts!",

How did scope creep affect the design over time? Maybe SQL made sense at the time but the table just kept growing and now it's incredibly messy.\n\nThe worst thing for me was studying system design stuff and you get references to Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc. etc. as examples of tools to solve a problem. The question is that if you never used these, you have no clue on how it works.\n\nIf at your job you use AWS, then try to solve these problems (or realize the shortcomings) with some tools that AWS provides (DynamoDb, SQS, etc). Then you can learn why Dynamodb might be a better option over Redis or something, even if you've never used Redis.\n\nIf you are not currently employed and are still a new grad looking for an entry position - usually system design isn't a part of the interview process because it's hard without on-field experience.",

They might be useful to the next programmer they hire.\n\nYour options are basically\n\n1. Treat this job as a waystation while you continue to search. A steady paycheque is nothing to sneeze at.\n\n2. Stay long term, and possibly try to bring in some more up to date tech. If there are lots and lots of small projects instead of one big monolith, that could make it easier to rewrite them in Blazor one by one.\n\nWhich one you choose depends on circumstances. I've worked at a place like that, but mainly because they had good benefits which made up for the outdated codebase. If you do stay, find some way to work with newer tech either at work or on personal projects.\n\nAlso, it's possible that this sort of legacy shop is the best place to be. Less likely to replace everyone with AI.",

It's easy for me to feel beholden to my work based on minimal benefits, and a lot of that comes from being a minimum wage worker within the last 5 years so I'm still not used to any form of benefits. \n\nMy boss really is pushing for newer technology, but it's slow going. With this in mind I'm thinking of relaxing into the role a bit but focusing on the newer tech learning primarily. If things don't seem to be moving forward and improving over the next few years that may be my sign to move on, but I do like the people I work with and the company is very enthusiastic about any engagement. Just asking for learning materials seemed to be viewed very positively, and dedication looks to be well rewarded here. It seems like poor management has led to stagnation, and the team is all fairly new to working on this specific project so there's absolutely room to grow. It was mostly getting on my nerves yesterday and with some time to reconsider, you're right: steady pay is good. \n\nThank you again for this perspective!",
