That was a bit of a red flag, especially since his resume said he graduated from a public university in Brazil (where it‚Äôs rare to have classes in anything other than Portuguese).\n\nHe turned his camera on for a second, then quickly turned it off saying his internet was unstable. My husband mentioned he seemed to be of Asian descent, but it was hard to say for sure. Weirdly enough, the guy still managed to answer some pretty tough Java questions and even spotted issues in code with no problem.\n\nA few days later, we randomly saw a video showing AI tech that can fake someone‚Äôs face during a video call ‚Äî the example showed a low-res, vaguely Asian-looking face... and it looked a lot like the guy from the interview. ü´†",

But there are a few points I don't entirely agree with.\n\nI also work for a company that is relatively reasonable in its tech stack. We only have a few TB of data for more than 10 years of operations and most of it runs on an on-prem setup using mostly open source tools. No cloud bloat or any of that.\n\n> There‚Äôs a tool for ingestion. A tool for orchestration. A tool for transformation, reverse ETL, governance, monitoring and if you‚Äôre lucky, a tool for remembering why you started this project in the first place.\n\nI'm a big ELT proponent. Part of the ELT philosophy is that each part of your pipeline performs as few tasks as logically necessary.\n\nMy ingest/outgest scripts run in python and they *only* do ingest/outgest. They don't perform a single transformation unless they absolutely have to.\n\nI run my transformations with dbt.\n\nI schedule my jobs with Airflow. I don't really see how I would orchestrate my pipeline unless with an orchestrator (CRON would also do fine). Or does the author imply we should have an alarms set somewhere so we can manually run these singular scripts he seems to such a big fan of?\n\n> But here‚Äôs the secret the consultants won‚Äôt tell you:\n> Fewer moving parts means fewer bugs. Faster answers. A fighting chance that someone on your team actually understands what the hell is going on.\nOne script. One machine. One person who can debug it without a PhD in vendor certifications.\n\nI have seen these 'One script. One machine. One person.' solutions he's talking about. I've made a bit of a career out of refactoring them. Often that 'One person' fucked off some place else and now no one understands this one script that is taking 40 minutes to run every 30 minutes.\n\nThese one scripts typically had hundreds of moving parts that seemed to perform tasks with varying degrees of usefulness and efficiency. Except it's almost impossible to figure out what part does what since it's all thrown together.\n\nIf you One Script performs ingest/outgest and transform at the same time, good luck debugging your hot mess. If something goes wrong you've now got hundreds of lines of code to comb through to find the offending part.\n\nWhen something goes wrong in my stack, debugging is easy as hell.\n\nDoes the problem happen between the source and my RAW schema? Well, just look in the ingestion scripts. Is it between RAW and the final data set? Check the dbt queries. Is it between the final data set and the consumer? Check the outgest scripts.\n\nWhen each moving part performs a single, clearly defined task, debugging is a lot easier.\n\nYes, it is true in engineering that fewer moving parts typically means a less complex system, trying to cram as many functionalities in as few moving parts as possible is also not the best idea in general.\n\nImagine building a house and having your water and your electricity lines all using the same pipes in the wall/floor. Sure, you've got to install fewer pipes, but good luck when one of your water lines has a leak.",

Pandas and MySQL aren't going to allow your machine to run at their full capacity on a project like this. You *can* do it, but it just isn't what they were designed for.\n\nInstead, I recommend using tools like Polars and/or DuckDB.  Armed with those, you can run analyses on data this size (and bigger) with a laptop, stream through terabytes of data, and imagine what you're going to do with all the money you just saved on cloud spend. \n\nHappy coding!",

Have a bi-weekly 1:1 with your team and ask them about the challenges they face which they may not want to talk about in front of the others and more importantly, what they want to do in their careers. If somebody wants to become a senior, give them projects on which they need to lead to assess their acumen for future sr. or team leader role.\n\n3. Identify SMEs in your team and create the culture of your team trying to solve problems internally or with the help of SME instead of reaching out to you on everything. \n\nIf I were to summarize my job in 1 line It's this - My job is to remove any roadblocks for my team and layout guardrails.

Data Modelling of real world scenarios (like whatsapp, facebook, zomato, doordash, uber db design or db design for some particular business requirements)-> Refer Kimball for this\n2. Product Sense: This part specifically deals with the product and business scenarios. Cases like business want to analyse certain aspects of the product and how you understand that requirement, how will you collect the data, what tools/tech stack will you use to gather that data, how will you design the pipeline for the same, what database/data warehouse will you use, realtime or batch etc etc. -> Refer DDIA, also you can look into Storage/data processing related chapters of Alex Xu's book\n\n\nYeah, I guess the above two covers the system design rounds, the rest I think are sql/python coding and management rounds.",

If you didn't do that, I would definitely suggest starting right there.\n\nTo that end, the more you can get queries to execute in batches together the better.

That'll make a significant cost decrease. \n* Dont stack tables on top of each other in layers if you dont really need to. e.g if your table is almost 1:1 from your staging to your gold layer make bronze and silver views then gold a table -- Conversely if some of your long running queries have a lot of joins on heavy views then make those incremental tables \n* Last one - heavy filters on CTEs where possible",

        "body": "estimator is hot garbage in general. more specifically, your workloads and compute engines really specifically influence your capacity and your usage.\n\nfor example, sql database in fabric refers specifically to the OLTP database, which CRUD events are events billed as interactive usage (\\~10 minute billing window), whereas your OLAP queries are billed as background jobs (24 hour billing).\n\nit also doesn't take into account that you can host your semantic models in non-premium workspaces, therefore the refresh (background) and report (interactive) usage is not billed against your capacity. this will work to reduce the actual estimate because an F32 will still require each of your 100 users to have their own pro licence. at F64 and above, your regular users will not need a licence. if your org already uses Fabric in general with E5 M365 licences, everyone would already have a pro licence completing taking out a big chunk of the cost estimation.\n\nDFG2 is also the most expensive engine in Fabric at 16 CUs per second for queries that sink to a destination. this means your four hours of estimated DFG2 usage may equate to 230k CU(s) PLUS whatever you incur on the SQL endpoint read side. however, you could write Spark jobs that do the same thing as the DFG2 for 0.5 CUs per second, in reality this ends up being jobs that are 10% of the DFG2 cost.\n\nlong story short: you can always start small and scale up, avoid publishing content in premium capacities if everyone already has pro licences (keep your Fabric capacity for your Fabric items), avoid DFG2's where possible, understand what PBI Pro licences the org already has",

I really want to emphasize that before my next comments, as you did ask for a roast =). Also really appreciate you showing your limitations and where you asked for help in this. \n\nNow for the actual roast part...\n\nWhile I have no issue with the whole ETL as a tech process and completely agree with it, I wonder if going for a full analytics/column-based solution as your destination was the right call here. From what I understood, you want the users of your product to be able to look up the weather for their next climb. Meaning your back will probably have to serve data a couple of rows at a time, at most. Look up a crag, get the weather, yeah no it's bad, look up next crag, and so on. But no aggregation on the average yearly temperature at 6pm every day on all the crags in Cumbria. The first example is a row based workload, or transactional; the second is columnar, analytical. Parquet and duckdb are really good at the latter, no so much at the former.\n\nI understand you tried using PostgreSQL then failed and went to duckdb in order to make some progress, that's good. Going forward I really think you should give PostgreSQL another try, it's way better suited to what you want to do. Also it has a great extension (postgis) to deal with geodata, which you will need to. For the same reason I think you would benefit from reconsidering your data model, as I think a fact/dim approach is going to be deserving you. Your model feels like you had to forcefully bend it in order to fit in. Sure, it works, but there's a lot of tension between your data and the model. Don't know how to express it otherwise.\n\nHope it helps, don't hesitate if you have questions, I'd be happy to provide further guidance if needed.",

Once they can see what you are doing they will just follow. They need to see it, experience it, support it. You can‚Äôt convince them by discussing new ideas, they will always shoot them down. They need a hands on experience to see it‚Äôs not overhead and worth the cost. It‚Äôs will change - over time. Perhaps a long time. So, make the choice now - stay or leave.",

They are the backbone of Airflow and, in fact, they are being used underneath the taskflow API. It's important to understand that there's no direct value passing between task-decorated functions in Airflow (xcom is used for that). Note that I'm talking from my experience with Airflow 1.x and 2.x, and the newest 3.0 release may invalidate some of my knowledge :)\n\nAlways treat Airflow tasks as separate processes running on separate virtual machines, even if they aren't. It'll save you time when you decide to scale Airflow workers. E.g. use shared object storage or database to exchange the data between tasks. \n\nMake tasks granular enough for ease of retry and debugging.\n\nUse idempotency for complex data pipelines to its fullest. In Airflow, data\\_interval\\_start/end macros are leveraged for that.",

Use airflow for orchestrating not for data processing, while that is not a hard and fast rule, I see a lot of failures when workers run out of memory because their pandas ingested too much data. Worst part of that is, you loose all your logs, so it‚Äôs hard to work out what went wrong.  What to do? Track the size of data you are processing and compare them to the memory you have. If you see a trend that tells you you are headed for OOM situations, export the data processing function into a serverless option, be it a k8s pod or any other option.\n2. When you download files to a worker, make sure you clean it up reliably, to avoid running out of disk space eventually. Use the tempfiles module appropriately.\n3. Avoid large xcoms. It stresses the meta data db and impacts overall processing. If you have large data to pass between tasks, consider using external storage.\n4. Avoid dags that run more frequently than once every 10 minutes. The round robin nature of the scheduler means for a non trivial setup can exceed  several minutes and you may not be able to keep up.  \n5. Avoid dags that watch for file changes and do that every few minutes (as above). See if you can have an external file watcher trigger the day instead. Alternatively space it so it checks every 30 minutes.\n6. Review the day code for expensive functions at module level. The dag gets executed every few minutes and everything at module level gets run every few minutes. So variable.get uses your database, why stress it with hundreds and thousands of such calls. Move these into your python functions.\n7. Use logging but use it judiciously, your logs can end up in your metadata base, or at least in your file system. \n8. Monitor and manage the size of your metadata base. If it‚Äôs too big you can‚Äôt run snapshots/backups.",

IMO that's not a basic tech stack, a cron pulling some data directly into powerbi is basic, that's a tech stack powered by three separate vendors that can get very expensive.\n\nThe first question is: are you part of the product the company is making or is it a cost center?  I assume you've priced out what it would cost and what you expect it to cost in a year, in addition to how long you think it would take to move to that stack?  So that's the first place you can sell it, that it will return you more money as part of a better/more robust product feature or that it will be cheaper overall than paying devs to maintain these scripts.\n\nThe second question is: what does it give you that you don't already have?  A very reasonable question you might receive is 'yes it's a hack but it's working for us, is rewriting it the most important thing to be pursuing at this time?'  Like if all the data is there and I just want to see a report about how many frobnozzles we foobricked and or how much uptake my great new feature is getting and you're like 'first we should rewrite the entire tech stack' you need to be able to articulate the value of it beyond 'these JS scripts offend my aesthetic sensibilities'\n\nThe third question I would ask is what are the long-term expectations of you in this role because IMO startups don't actually need DEs, but since titles in this industry are relatively meaningless, it's possible that what they really want right now is a 'data analyst' (often code for 'pbi monkey'), so the third question to me are everyones expectations aligned here?  Then maybe outline a plan for an incremental move to this stack you want.",

Everything you put effort into needs to be laser focussed on reducing the chance of both those things happening.\n\nI'm not convinced a data warehouse is the right move if your manager doesn't think it is. You can build and retrofit one down the line when there's a compelling reason and/or enough stability in the company's economics. I say this as a lover of data warehouses, Kimball, Roche's Maxim, and good data architecture in general: but there's a time and a place.\n\nMy employer, a ~500 person publicly traded company, managed for _many years_ without a data warehouse, pulling data directly into Power BI from quite a few different business applications, with a lot of logic repetition between different semantic models. Would it have been easier if they'd done a DW from the outset, long before I joined? Yes, but then adoption of Power BI might not have taken off and the whole initiative could have been binned.\n\nMuch better to provide business value quickly, in a way that's horrible behind the scenes, and then sort it out incrementally while adding more business value steadily. Kimball even advocates for this quite explicitly in DWTK!",

I would say Python is a quick and easy language that is the most broadly used in data. So learn it.\n \nOrchestrate: airflow has been around a long time and is very good. Some people tend to say it‚Äôs way harder to get setup than the ‚Äúnew‚Äù stuff. Usually they used an old version were a lot of things needed to be managed for the system to run correctly. Then you have ‚Äúnew‚Äù orchestrator in the market which try to make it easy like Dagster, prefect, mage.\n\nClean and transformation : you have the python frameworks (pandas, polars), you have your sql engine (DBT, trino, presto), you have spark, you have your DuckDB.\n\nMost compagnie would be fine with an up to date version of Postgres. But they usually run old 2010 version of sqlserver that run REAL slow, so they think they have a lot of data and switch to an OLAP system when they migrate. If you heard something like I have a LOT of data to transform. 1 million rows, 10 million rows, 100 millions rows you can assume that the company DOESN‚ÄôT have a lot of data at all. And that any db would work. If it‚Äôs 100 millions rows every hour that‚Äôs another thing but usually people talk about their global table size unless they have really a lot of data and usually when they do they already know the solution because they already hit issues so many times with their systems.\n\nFor OLAP (managed) you have snowflake, Databricks BigQuery, Redshift.\nOLAP (OSS) Pinot, clickhouse\n\nThere‚Äôs a lot more but that cover most scenarios or ‚Äúnew‚Äù company\n\n\nAccess : you have a bunch of tools here but like tableau, power bi, sigma if you are 100% snowflake, metabase for small company, superset for bigger. And a bunch more.\n\nSo no real definitive stack but you have those.\n\nIf I was to start fresh in a new company that has received funding and that I know there‚Äôs going to be A LOT of data (multiple terabytes at least) I would probably do Dagster, DBT, snowflake, sigma, python ingestion in Dagster.\nWhy? Because if they have investors and the company is pretty small they want to delivers new things fast even if it cost them more. If the couple of new things works or fail fast then it‚Äôs good for the business, they‚Äôll hire more and continue growing the business. And the stack is pretty much all managed so you pay for maintenance and upgrades and everything you don‚Äôt have to do those things, and you can focus on business requirement.\n\nIf it was a small company that expect a lot of data with no funding, I‚Äôll go the datalake approach. Because snowflake will be expensive no matter what.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt have a lot of data Postgres Dagster python, DBT might be a good fit.\n\nThere no real stack but those are nice.\n\nPersonally I would always go with a sql framework for transformation at start not because it‚Äôs better just because sql is easy enough that mostly anyone can understand and build some stuff while python transformation can get confusing when you chain a bunch of stuff together and it require programming knowledge which not everyone has.\n\nGood luck",

But that here would mean making a useful website, and probably adding more data because if its just weather, people already know what sites are near them and its easy to just check the weather for those sites.\n\nThe other path is just going full on tinkering. I would suggest maybe getting some free cloud resources and use one of the big data warehouses in one of the clouds. Create tables there with DBT. Maybe your extra data can be weather history. Maybe there is a thermometer at some sites and you can check foretasted weather vs real weather.\n\n  \nOptimization is really not needed most of the time.

Good work! You can, for example, always add more or better data validation but what's point in that since your data source is relatively static and error in data isn't critical. Or make more efficient database schema for few thousand lines of data which is extremely little and databases handle that with ease, same goes for changing from DuckDB to PostgreSQL. You can always make better ETL process, or program, but if your goal is to get something out then you have to stop optimizing at some point and publish or finalize something.",

You copy from Prod data into UAT and test there to see if anything breaks, or, build in UAT pre-determined data with SQL scripts, so that results from any process / pipeline can be tested.\n\nSo test for missing columns, null data, business rules. This is also work-intensive, this approach, but DE-person agnostic. Have each DE that does a change, in JIRA, write some conditions for success. Have a person dedicated for the DevOps / UAT testing phase.\n\nA great place I worked at, every sprint rotation cycle, a different person was assigned the DevOps/UAT, so that we all gained the experience. Over time the code base improved.\n\nI've seen many companies not even have a DEV environment, only one, that is prod. Ideal is 3 environments, Dev, UAT, Prod. Since it's for dashboards / reporting, if something breaks, not an issue, we will fix today and tomorrow you'll have your data (maybe).

If you want a portfolio project for data engineering jobs, spin up a tiny Kubernetes or Ray cluster on something like AWS Spot nodes. Even a three-node run shows you can handle cloud orchestration.\n\nStreaming ingestion can be worth it if your target is ‚Äúnear real time‚Äù dashboards for devs watching new reviews flow in. Stick Kafka or Redpanda in front, keep micro-batches small, and output rolling aggregates to a cache. Transformer summarization can handle chunks of, say, 128 reviews at a time without killing latency.\n\nwith Dask on multiple nodes, workers sometimes drop off during long GPU jobs. Enable heartbeat checks and auto-retries.\n\nGood luck.",

The worker distribution helps with the cost as instead of a sequential run which took me 30 minutes to process a single file which contains 200k reviews, the current implementation takes 2 minutes to do the same. and the application is session based and does not run the whole time. I still have a few optimizations to do.\n\n  \nstreaming ingestion, though i mentioned it in the post, does not make sense right now because the steam reviews need to be extracted from their web API, since the application summarized millions of reviews, it would have to redo the whole process for the previous reviews as well as the new reviews which just came in. I could work on that as a future addition.\n\n  \nThank you for your input and would love to know more about how i can improve.

If there's a constant... It's that healthcare data is an entirely different ball of wax than you're used to working with everywhere else. \n\nNot only are the structures weird and deeply nested but the context of the data can be hard to grasp for some. Also, security is a big factor you have to understand. For example no offshore employee can even get a sniff of production Medicaid or Medicare data or you're violating the law. That's a federal law. Some onshore people can't ever look at federal employee plan data for certain situations. \n\nNot only that but the amount of vendors and integrations that have all these mind numbing weird schema layouts that don't at all conform to a standard like FHIR makes everyone's life hell in this space.\n\nUnderstanding the complexity of healthcare plan info like the relationship of a member to the group to the plan(s) to the product(s) can get a little out of hand. Then you have a claims where you need a 45 day runout because a single healthcare claim line can change a ton of times before it's actually approved or rejected but you have to capture everyone of those steps along the way. \n\nThen you always have to be prepared and ready for an audit by either someone internally in your org or someone from the government so your documentation and processes need to be on point.\n\nThe reason why we need people with experience in healthcare data is because it's very hard to ramp up people with 0 experience. When I bring on juniors to my team I don't expect them to \"get the data\" for like 24 to 36 months and even then you are always learning new parts or domains of healthcare data and probably still don't understand all the nuances around the data. \n\nIt's just easier to bring someone in that would have at least a clue about what a care plan resource in FHIR format looks like, how to load it, and how to extract from it.\n\nThe true gatekeeper is really the rules, regs, complexity and lack of enforced standardized format amongst all healthcare companies whether that be health plans, pbm's, provider groups, client groups, hospital groups, these middleware companies that claim to give you robust integrations...

If you have like 3 tables about the same thing and it make sense to just have 1 table you join them.¬†\n\n\nThe second layer is where you test your data extensively. At this point there was no business rules applied or anything. Just renaming, retyping, null value handling at most.

I like to make one model for each business rule as dbt with duckdb takes like 1-2 seconds for 200k rows. Having multiple transformations together is exhausting to debug, and not really more efficient.¬†\n\n\nForth layer is where I make my Kimball modeling. One fact for each thing I look at.

Junk dimensions are build using a SELECT DISTINCT to only have values that happens.¬†\n\n\nJust remember to generate surrogate keys with dbt so you can joins dimensions and facts using a single column. And never join facts together, it's not how a star model work. Having multiple facts inside a single powerbi dashboard works well if you keep it classy. Also remember for each dimensions to have a default value for missing keys. Like adding a \"missing customer\" to your customer dimension.\n\n\nLastly with dbt and surrogate keys you do not need to join fact and dimensions during the ETL phase as you do not need to use the foreign keys to retrieve the surrogate keys. It's weird to not have integers as surrogate keys but trust the process.",

No more 3am pipeline debugging sessions.\n\nThree years ago our data team was drowning. Beautiful medallion architecture (bronze ‚Üí silver ‚Üí gold) that looked great in slides but was a nightmare to maintain. Every layer had schema changes, quality issues, debugging headaches. We spent more time figuring out which layer broke than building features.\n\nBreaking point: a simple schema change cascaded through 7 tables and killed reporting for two days. That's when we rebuilt everything around FITT principles.\n\nThe four FITT principles:\n\n1. Functional - Pure functions only. Same input = same output, always. Made everything immutable by default. Storage is cheap, debugging corrupt state at 2am isn't.\n\n2. Idempotent - Run it 1000 times, same result. Recovery = just re-run it. Junior devs actually experiment now instead of being terrified.\n\n3. Tested - Tests as architectural components. Every pipeline has data quality, business logic, and integration tests. They're living documentation.\n\n4. Two-stage - Raw ‚Üí Final, that's it. Raw data stays immutable forever. Final data ready for consumption. Everything in between is ephemeral.\n\nWe ditched bronze/silver/gold entirely. Those layers were just arbitrary complexity.\n\nKey implementation patterns:\n\n\n\nDev/Prod split: Dev uses yesterday's data + today's code. Prod uses today's data + yesterday's code. Never deploy untested.\n\nGit as truth: Want results from 6 months ago? Check out that commit and re-run against raw data.\n\nIncremental processing: Each increment is idempotent. Run once or 50 times, same result.\n\n\n\nResults after:\n\n\n\nOn-call incidents dropped %\n\nNew hires productive in weeks, not months\n\nData quality issues caught in dev, not prod\n\nNo more mysterious data drift\n\n\n\nCommon pushback:\n\n\"Storage costs!\" - Compute is cheaper than engineering time.\n\n\"Performance?\" - Less debugging = more optimization time.\n\n\"Over-engineering?\" - Worth it if you have 3+ people on pipelines.\n\nGetting started:\n\n\n\nPick one pipeline that breaks a lot\n\nMake raw data immutable\n\nAdd comprehensive tests\n\nEliminate staging layers\n\nMake it idempotent\n\n\n\nFITT made data engineering boring again (in the best way).

If you ask the self-glorious Analytic DEs (like me) who bath in the thought that we care oh so much about business logic (see my previous post), they just write queries for each table. We use DBT so every table is a \"model\", a glorified SELECT query with a bunch of configs. If you are interested you can probably create your weak version of DBT if your company doesn't use it.\n\n> how to manage the metadata of a table ( column names, types etc) that is tightly coupled to the code?\n\nEh, different teams treat it differently. Some teams use...Excel sheets. Some tools such as DBT addresses the issue. But whatever the tool is, it needs humans to feed in information. Automated tools exist too I think, but it's just a ticking bomb if humans don't check from time to time.",

        "body": "Here's some general suggestions:\n\n1: Care more about what your file/module look like than about whether you use classes in the right way or follow code patterns. Avoid large interconnected codebases, have clear interfaces and responsibility splits with other teams. Your main measure of maintainability should be whether you can easily transfer ownership of your code to another team with little context.\n\n2: Simple imperative code in pipelines is perfect for most usecases. Be explicit and avoid magic. [Push for loops down and ifs up](https://matklad.github.io/2023/11/15/push-ifs-up-and-fors-down.html) to make it at least possible to optimize code later and be very careful about functions that can't operate on batches. If you use streaming iterators, use your languages equivalent of chunked and call batch functions on chunks, don't call single element functions in an iterator.\n\n3: Understand the difference between struct of arrays and array of struct (aka row based vs column based), be aware of which of the two applies to the data formats you use and process things in their natural order. This combines nicely with chunking.\n\n4: If you use python, use ruff and uv, declare dependencies clearly in pyproject.toml, and use type hints on anything public. Prefer simple functions over classes, take protocol classes as input and spit out concrete data structures as output. Use asserts often, especially if something might need a comment.\n\n5: Make your data partitionable if possible. If you use a database, there should be a clear way to split it into (for example) ten smaller DBs with the same layout, and only need to copy small tables. Try to identify or create natural keys that are shared over the entire data pipeline that can be used to neatly split data without overlap. If you can't do this, you have most likely made things too complex and your data should probably be flattened.",

It‚Äôs columnar, optimized for scan-heavy queries, and handles large joins better. At 2.8TB and growing, Postgres will get painful for historical analysis.\n\n\\-Syncing data into Redshift with 5-10 min lag is fine using CDC, we have multiple customers doing that at terabyte scale and we are consistently getting <5 min latency even after taking into account the time to run Merges.\n\n**Is it important for data to get into the \"warehouse\" quickly and it's ok for analytical queries to be slower?** \n\n\\-If this is the case, CDC to get data into Postgres will be faster (seconds, instead of <5 mins). But the tradeoff is analytical queries will take much longer to run on Postgres vs Redshift. \n\n**As for your questions:** \n\n1. Depending on the use case downstream, you might want to think about fanning in from many single tenant DBs and writing into large multi-tenant table. Separately you could do a 1 to 1 sync and then use dbt to transform and combine the tables. Our CDC pipeline ([Artie](https://www.artie.com/?utm_source=reddit)) can either fan-in in-flight or do 1:1 syncs, so we've done both. \n\n2. Postgres vs S3: very diff roles. When you land in S3 in parquet files, you'll have to write the logic later to Merge delta files and recreate the current table view - that's overhead you need to consider. \n\n3. Redshift will be easier to manage long term IMO. You‚Äôll likely outgrow Postgres for analytics. Redshift can save you a future migration.\n\n4. DMS is great to start off, but at certain scale it becomes unreliable. We've observed that it starts causing problems with data consistency and latency when you start doing mid-to-high 100s of millions of rows a month. That's when we see a lot of DMS customers migrate over to Artie (disclaimer: I work there) for a CDC pipeline that they can trust to scale with them. \n\n5.

When you were using Aurora as the landing zone, did you use a workflow tool **(**dbt, Airflow, or Glue**)** to extract and transform the data before loading it into Redshift?\n2. Now that you're using S3 as the landing zone, how are you achieving near real-time delivery to Redshift?

It is big enough that sustainability and ecotox is a very big deal given the scale and there is obviously external pressure being such a big company. Small changes to supply chain or ingredients can have big implications on the environment (and communities). There is a big push internally for eco-labelling our products in the way ingredients are.\n\nThere are lots of data challenges when selling in ~200 countries with tens of thousands of products. Being able to estimate say, greenhouse gas emissions and life cycle assessment for a product portfolio right down to biodegradability of packaging types, or even how well recycling centres can detect plastics etc. isn‚Äôt easy. Tools like https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/ exist but they need very granular data right down to global sales.\n\nI‚Äôm more on the human safety side so don‚Äôt personally get all that close to it but PM me any questions if you think I can help. I bridge a lot of science areas but our sustainability and ecotox have by far the lowest tech skills, so there may not be that many jobs but someone with domain knowledge and even basic tech skills may be rare. A few people have left that area for oil companies, lol.",

        "body": "I would understand if you‚Äôre hesitant given the current political climate, but have you considered looking into the national lab complex (DOE) ? Some labs have pretty narrow research focuses, but most do work on more fields than you‚Äôd initially think, and likely have groups/divisions dedicated to what you‚Äôre interested in. \n\nThis is especially true for teams in the computational science sector, and having practical experience in data engineering and knowledge of the subject matter you‚Äôre into is very valuable. \n\nOn the upside: Pay tends to be a little better than other non-profits, though certainly less than industry. Also, while national labs are partially funded through and ultimately report back to DOE, most are actually run by contractors (Battelle being one of the big ones). This means that we‚Äôre usually treated similarly to government employees by everyone but the actual government, so we don‚Äôt (always) have to deal with the same BS federal employees are going through right now. This can also make it more straightforward to get access to certain data that wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be available. \n\nOn the downside: Most funds that come into the labs still come from other government offices like NIH, DOT, DOE, etc. So there is still susceptibility to political trade winds, especially for environmental stuff. Fortunately most research staff are pretty savvy at making subtle/small changes to existing projects to fly under the radar and appease their sponsors, as it were. \n\nAlso, in my experience (YMMV) labs tend to be insular, so it can be hard to get in, but it‚Äôs easier to move around (even between labs) once you‚Äôre in and making connections. My advice would be to make connections with staff whose research you‚Äôd be interested in assisting with. Some will be more open than others, but if they like you and need your skill set, they may be able to create a new DE position with you in mind, or at least point you to another group that might need you.\n\nETA: I ended up in renewable-adjacent work with a background in mechanical engineering and experience with machine learning. I‚Äôve learned everything I know about DE on the job, and I‚Äôm not the only person I know who‚Äôs done that. I will also admit I knew someone (outside of research) at a lab who was able to pass my resume around more directly. So I mean it when I advise making connections with existing staff. It only got me to the interview stage, but sometimes that‚Äôs enough.",

We have a data eng team <3 And 50-60 downstream users. Not every user is directly querying but we support a lot of SFDC, Hubspot, Zendesk, any SAAS platform some team decides to use. We cannot keep up proper optimization of every single one of these platforms tables by setting the correct split and dist key it's just unrealistic (yes they have an automated version now last I heard it was in private preview but I don't expect it to be good)\n\nDatabricks automatically handles via liquid clustering and automated vacuuming.\n\nBecause of this your price per compute usage is so much lower on Databricks (probably other platforms as well). The queries run much quicker on the same priced clusters.\n\n - Severless yes redshift has Redshift serverless and it's fucking dog shit and you're paying a lot. Because it's so bad you're effectively still tied to paying for compute + data, which scaled horrendously for us.\n\nOther platforms allow spinning up and down compute much simpler than Redshift does imo -> more savings.\n\n- Because of the simplified compute system you can separate jobs much more easily so resources aren't fighting with each other during a heavy dev dbt run or fivetran sync. You can do this in Redshift by modifying the WLM but it's just a bitch and you can still run into problems, it's very much a trial and error process.\n\n- If you're working with any JSON in redshift I'm sorry.\n\n- We had some governance problems that were helped via the transition, but I don't think the problem was redshift specific.\n\n- Not totally relevant but we also had some ML/GenAI jobs we were wanting to use Databricks for so doubled up our use case.\n\n- Federated queries make a migration insane easy.\n\nCaveat databricks really can be just as pricey as redshift serverless if you leave it to auto scale and aren't particular with your compute sizings. \n\nDownside: a lot of SAAS platforms support Redshift integrations but don't typically build out much more than Snowflake, BQ.

        "body": "I have thought about this a lot lately.  I disagree with you when it comes to students.  They absolutely SHOULD NOT use A.I.  A.I. destroys your ability to think.  It may not happen immediately, but it does.  I've read countless stories from developers that lose their ability to not only think critically, but can't even remember basic syntax over time.  This isn't just happening to programmers.  This is happening to other fields as well.  The brain is a muscle and if you don't use it, you can't develop it.  Now, I'm not saying that its not a valuable tool.  It definitely is, but if you are a student or still in the process of learning, A.I. takes away the process of learning that develops your critical thinking skills and the repetition that you need to learn syntax when you are learning.  This is also why you take so many math classes.  Are you going to use Trigonometry or Calculus out in the real world?  Probably not, but that's not the point.  The point is that the process of doing it helps develop your critical thinking and analytical skills.  The same goes for programming\n\nI'm speaking from experience on this.  I'm a 3rd year CS student.  My first year I made the mistake in using A.I. in my Computer Science 1 class.  Its essentially the 1st class you take that teaches C++ and programming fundamentals like OOP, abstraction, and recursion.  Halfway through the class, once we started working on anything remotely more difficult than defining a function, I used A.I.  I didn't realize how much I didn't learn anything until I got to Computer Science 2 the following summer.  I couldn't write anything beyond basic console apps.  I turned off all A.I. including Intellisense, and went through my Computer Science 1 book and did all the projects from that class again.  I actually retained the information that time.\n\nI have seen so many posts about people who are on the last year of their CS degree, or even graduated, and they don't know how to code.  I don't know how this is even possible if you aren't just copying code for projects.  This summer I'm in Data Structures and Algorithm Design.  Last weeks project was to write algorithms for linear sort, merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort, and print to console the running time along with their Big O Notation to prove their runtime complexity.  I would love for someone to tell me how they did that if they don't know how to code.",

Use it to figure out the problem rather than solve it. This is sooo hopeful.\n\nBut on the negative, I had to stop half way through school and turn all my auto complete off, I had to take the productivity features away, because I wasn‚Äôt learning the proper syntax and way about setting things up. When it came time to do tests and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to use these, I was helpless. That got me to thinking, for coding interviews, the same was going to happen. So I did, I stripped away the AI portions of what I was working on, and things got slower, but then they got quicker, and I started making better decisions.\n\nIt‚Äôs a double edged sword! You need it, but you also need to learn how to function without it. I realize that once you‚Äôre working in a professional environment you won‚Äôt be scrutinized, but rather promoted to use AI tools, but for a young dev, you also need to not skip the nitty gritty. It‚Äôs like when I went to school for electronics engineering too, you can‚Äôt just use kmaps, you have to learn some binary algebra first.

        "body": "People are often thrown into this class with only a vague notion of what a log in math is.  This is a bad starting point right off the bat.   Also, its VERY easy to get confused about WHAT YOU ARE COUNTING.  Bad books; you can't tell if they are counting the comparisons or the swaps in a sort algorithm.  Those numbers can be similar or very different.\n\nYou are in part telling me without telling me that you don't understand the NOTATION.  The concept aside, O(1) is notation for the simplest thing you can do: you do one operation (this can have several steps) and get the result.  Eg array\\[user\\_input\\] = 0;  you go there, you do something, you are done.  Sure, that is like 8 assembly instructions or something, but big-O is a conceptual level thing, not a detail level thing.  You wanted to know how many assignments, you did 1.\n\nO(N) is similar.  you iterate an array and add 5 to each element.  How many times did you add 5?  Well, you did it for whatever the size of the array is, but we didn't say...  that is abstracted to the letter \"N' which just means \"some amount of them\".   You write that one O(N), see how that works?\n\nlooping over every element with nested loops is a multiply.. for(1-n){for (1-n again)} .. how many times does the inner part happen?  Its N\\^2 .. the outer loop does n inner loops for 1, n inner loops for 2, ...  right?  And that is unsurprisingly written O(N\\^2).\n\nSo the notation is O (some expression of N).   some expression of N could be almost anything you might see in math, from N! to log(N) to N\\^3 to sqrt(N) or whatnot.  Big-O only keeps the dominant terms (eg 3n\\^3 + 11n\\^2 + 37) is just written O(n\\^3) ..  because in the big picture, the cubed term will soon dwarf the others and give you a general sense of how slow it will be.\n\n\\-------------------\n\na log is just an exponent, with its own math notation that is weird and a bunch of cool properties that you are told to memorize without being led to connect the dots, the first time you see them, and many people never get much past that part.   I mean, its stuff you know, though, if you can just see past the notation and look at the numbers.  0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 ... you know these guys ... its the powers of 2.  How many times, using only integers, can you cut the number 100 in half?  Even rounding it up..  50 (once), 25(twice) 13(three times), 7(4), 4(5),2(6),1(7) and done.   Hmm.  2\\^7 is... 128.  Hmm.  See the connection?  The math problem is \"to what integer power do I raise 2 to get 100\".  The answer is 6 or 7 depending on if you want to over shoot or under shoot the target.   THAT IS A LOG problem, and its all you are going to see in big-O is powers of 2.  No base 17 logs or e or anything from math that gets weird, just powers of 2, and that is the question it is asking and the answer.  Its not that scary, when you see it written out, hopefully?  All the log algorithms are about cutting the data in half over and over, just like that, for example think about how you search a physical book dictionary for a word: you open in the middle, and its more towards A or more towards Z, so you cut the half where it will be in half again...  is it more towards M or Z... more towards M or S ... whatever... (and yea humans jump to the first letter section better than by halfs but play along with the blind approach ... this is just what a binary search does ...  cuts the list in half until its down to 1 element and its found or not at that point). \n\nThat is about 85% of the big o stuff.  There will be other notations at the same time  that denote best case, average case, worst case and so on that you just need to memorize (the notation, I mean, memorize THAT) and rules (like the dropping of constants and taking the dominating term of the equation that your code defines.\n\nthere are not that many REAL in use big-O answers.  There is 1, lg(n), N\\*lg(n), N, N\\^powers, and the ugly stuff like N! or 2\\^N etc.  And practical algorithms rarely go abouve N\\^3 before someone gets mad and finds a better way (there are some things where there is no better way, but MOST stuff you see day in and day out has an answer N\\^3 or better).  I mean there are screwballs... shellsort for example often ends up with some form of O(N\\^(x+1/x))  eg N\\^7/6 was a common find back when I studied that algorithm.  But shell sort needs a freakin PHD level analysis to find the complexity for many of the sequences and its not handed out lightly to students.  You won't see that kind of mess most likely, or if you do, they will just give you the answer and tell you (indirectly) that it was a pain to figure that out.",

Basically you count the number of operations that your code performs.\n\nFor example, the very first LeetCode problem: given a list of integers, find a pair of integers that sum up to a given target. An example of non-optimal solution:\n\n    def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):\n                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:\n                    return [i, j]\n\nIt has a loop with n iterations (i index) and inside each iteration is another loop with n iterations (j index). So the code may evaluate the if statement up to n \\* n times, hence O(n\\*\\*2) time complexity.\n\nAn optimal solution:\n\n    def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n        prev_numbers = {}\n    \n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n            complement = target - num\n            if complement in prev_numbers:\n                return [prev_numbers[complement], i]\n            prev_numbers[num] = i\n\nIt has only a loop with n iterations. The code may evaluate the if statement up to n times max, hence O(n) complexity.\n\nAnother common introduction to the notation is a binary search. In a binary search you halve the length of the list at each iteration. How many times you divide the length of the list (n) until it becomes 1? Roughly log(n) / log(2). Hence O(log(n)) complexity for binary search.\n\nLook up multiple tutorials and introductions and build your own understanding of the subject. Don't just rely on a single course or tutorial.",

What if it contains 10 items? 100?\n\nIf you can look at the code and figure that type of thing out pretty quickly, then figuring out Big O becomes a lot easier to understand - you're really just talking about the relationship between the number of inputs and how many instructions and how one grows as the other grows.\n\nBut if you *can't* look at a code block like that pretty quickly and tell me roughly how many times the interior loop will run based on the length of the list, your problem isn't really understanding Big O notation. It is that your programming knowledge isn't advanced enough to really be able to grasp it. So if that's the case, I'd put worrying about Big O aside and instead return to focusing on the basics of reading and writing simple code until you really get it and can read it easily before returning to more theoretical concepts like Big O.",

Books and official documentation are the best for that.\n- Also, most (modern) documentations (if you go to their actual websites) are very beginner friendly, offering tutorials and even (practice) projects.\n\nSo, to sum it up.

How long does a randomly generated alpha-numeric GUID has to be in order to ensure it's collision-proof?  \n\nIt sounds like you're thinking about this the same way I did when I first looked into the subject. \"So, I'm supposed to generate a big-ass random number while jillions of other devs are simultaneously generating big-ass random numbers and just hope that none of us bump into each other? What's the logic here besides 'Trust me, bro'?\"  \n\nThe secret, at least for [Version 1 GUIDs](https://guid.one/guid/make), is that it's actually not entirely random, and that's a good thing. The idea behind a GUID is that it should be unique in time and space. With that in mind, it's pretty easy to deliberately avoid collisions by incorporating spacial (physical or logical space) and temporal components in combination with randomness.  \n\nIdentifying the exact latitude and longitude of the device generating the GUID is often infeasible, so a common practice is to use the machine's MAC address, or a hashed namespace (e.g., company/app URL). Basically, you're saying that this particular GUID was generated by *this* computer at *this* time, down to millisecond precision (or at least, as accurate as the onboard clock can be). That's probably good enough for most uses, but to kick it up a notch, we also generate a pretty good-sized random number, *and* check it against ones we've already made, and increment it if, by some miracle, we managed to come up with two of the same random number in the same thousandth of a second.  \n\nThe thing to take comfort in is that you don't actually need to be unique in all of time and space in the universe. You don't even need to be unique in the history of computing on Earth (although you almost certainly will be). You *probably* don't even need to be unique within your organization. What you care about most of the time is being unique within your application, or, really, within the primary key column of one single table.  \n\nWith that in mind, you can be confident that the pretty good-sized random number generated by Mike's computer at 3:14:15.926 PM on June 10th, 2025, to be used strictly for identifying records in sale_item table in SysCorp's home grown CRM, isn't going to conflict with any other GUIDs in that table.  \n\nFurther, if some rando in Timbuktu, or in the sandwich shop across the street, manages, against all odds, to generate the exact same GUID as one of yours, it doesn't matter, because *they're not putting it in your database.*  \n\nI hope this helps you feel better.",

No, a player isn't an enemy, wtf were you thinking? You already had a common base class, use that. Besides, an \"enemy\" isn't even a class in itself, nor should player be. They are just specific characters used for specific purposes. You're trying to inherit roles or behaviour, which is bad. Create one character class that supports \"can be controlled\", then player is just an instance that's controlled with mouse/keyboard while enemies are instances that are controlled automatically.\n\nSame thing with your archer/mage example. Being an archer is a playstyle, a role, or a behavior. It's still a character, use composition to indicate its roles and/or weapons that it uses. One useful tip is to think of \"can this change at runtime?\" If the answer is yes then use composition. Can a character become a building in the middle of the game? Uh, no. Can an enemy become an ally? Yes, people change their mind => use composition.\n\nAlso I have no idea what your issue with the Button is. Yes, use composition. Is checkbox something you can press?

You *should* of course think about the relationships between different objects, and you *should* prefer interfaces/protocols and containment over inheritance. But at the end of the day, what you really need to do is to be willing to aggressively refactor as needed. And that has little to do with OOP specifically... you're bound to make some mistakes as you write code in any paradigm, and you have to be willing to reconsider past decisions and change course.\n\n>Your object can't be two things at one.\n\nOf course it can. That's practically the definition of *polymorphism* \\-- \"many forms.\"\n\n>Let's say you have fighters, archers and mages in your game - three classes. At some point, you want the player to be both an archer and a mage. How do you do that without complex or ugly workarounds like creating another class named FighterAndMage ?\n\nWell, you *don't* do it with an inheritance graph like Object->Character->Player->\\[Fighter|Mage|Archer\\]. Instead, you could give the class that represents a player an attribute, like \\`role\\` and a corresponding \\`Role\\` type that sets the expectations for what a Role is. Fighter, Mage, and Archer *could* be derived from Role, or they could just be instances of Role -- i.e. all exactly the same type of object, but with different data. For example, it might be that any role can hit an adversary, and any role can cast spells, but a Fighter might just hit harder, and a Mage might have a higher probability of success with magic. If a player can have more than one role at a time, then the \\`role\\` attribute should really be \\`roles\\` and refer to some kind of collection or combination of the roles.\n\n>Encapsulation is a useful trait for OOP to make code more secure but getts and setters can add a lot of boilerplate.\n\nThat depends on the language. For example, in Swift you don't have to write any accessors -- you just use whatever attributes an object has. But there are implicit accessors there, and if you later want to modify them you can do so at any time.\n\n>With ECS you have a relation of \"IT HAS\" instead of \"IT IS\".\n\nWith OOP you have both types of relationships.

It works when your domain is more or less fixed, and you can draft the entire type hierarchy from the start. But if there's enough uncertainty and you need to add new types to the domain over time it's just too hard to get right. This is where something like an ECS shines because it's designed to give you maximum flexibility when defining types and assigning properties to them.\n\nI also don't think that DOD necessarily conflicts with OOP. DOD just tells you to design your classes around the data and how it's mutated instead of modeling your domain in code.",

Deep inheritance chains were very much a '90s or early '00s thing, and I think we've all seen the issues with them.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to think of OOP in terms of messages - Alan Kay (the guy who kinda invented the term) said he should have called it \"message oriented programming\", not object-oriented.  Joe Armstrong, the inventory of Erlang (a functional/actor language) once said that he thought Kay would disagree, but he considered Erlang more \"object-oriented\" than almost any other language, and Kay agreed.\n\nNow, that's a bit of a minority opinion, but it just goes to show how widely the definition of \"OOP\" can vary.\n\nIOW, I think your view of OOP is frankly very incomplete.

Start small and progress slowly (the key is that the exercises should challenge your knowledge and assumptions). You may extend the exercises with made-up additional tasks, and you may explore alternative solutions to the problem.

Check the **Frequently Asked Questions** here in the subreddit sidebar for recommended learning resources.\n\nStop using AI for anything apart from getting deeper explanations. Under no circumstances use it to do your thinking, to give you solutions, to give you code. Do not copy-paste code from somewhere else. Type it yourself.\n\nLearning programming requires effort. Learning programming requires practice. You need to come up with your own solutions. You need to struggle. You need to fight. You need to fail. You need to solve.

You need to research/evaluate these trade-offs and decide, which side your projects want to be on.\n\nTraditional databases are on the left side and provide a lot of \"safety\" and strict reliability for clean data.\n\nNoSQL databases typically fall on the right side. They sacrifice a lot of \"guarantees\" for scalability. If you choose one of these you have to consider issues that might occur from \"eventual consistency\" and not being able to really rely on the data structure returned by your database.\n\nRelational databases offer quite flexible queriing. Need to now which `Product`s a `Customer` has added to their shopping basket? SQL can query that! Later, need to now which `Customer`s have bought a certain `Product` (reverse)? That's just another SQL query! You don't have to change your database structure to support that.\n\nNoSQL often are not that flexible. If you structure your database to efficiently support the first query, it won't be as efficient to support the second query. Worst case, you'll have to completely restructure your DB to support the use case.\n\nParadoxically, NoSQL makes it very simple to store/retrieve an object structure, without much upfront-thinking about how your data looks like.

Famous computer scientist Donald Knuth once said \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\", meaning basically that we should worry about correctness and simplicity first, otherwise we will end up wasting all our time/shooting ourselves in the foot.\n\n2. The correct approach is to first have a working program/code/feature, and then assess whether the performance even is problematic, and then if it is, use profiling or instrumentation to see which part of the code is slow and why. Then, focus on optimizing only that part of the code.\n\n3. In order to understand why code is slow, you can look at it from an algorithmic standpoint, like for instance noticing a double for loop, meaning a potential N\\^2 algorithm, which could maybe be redone in some clever way to become O(N) or NlogN, OR you can look at it from a systems standpoint, for instance you are only using 1 thread/1 cpu core but your machine as 128 cores available, or you should be doing CPU work and IO at the same time, etc. to maximize utilization of the resources.\n\n4. I don't really think it's realistic to be able to write thing fast and efficient \"in the first draft\" as you say, it sort of goes against everything else I wrote here. That being said, depending on what kind of code you are writing, if you have a general understanding of basic algorithms like sorting and searching and so on, along with time complexity, maybe you can build some muscle for doing this just at a basic level. But I would not encourage you to try to optimize things at the system level in the first draft because usually it's more trouble than it's worth.",

I'm more focused on the quality of the interfaces/organization of the code units and how the mental model is reflected in the code, etc. Not focusing on speed first helps me to only compromise the design in areas where it's truly necessary due to identified performance issues.\n\nUsually when I do wind up fixing performance issues in my code, it usually comes in the form of caching. Has its tradeoffs. Sometimes I'm also able to change things to avoid garbage collection running as often or at inopportune moments.

Develop a good intuition for complexity (as in Big O) so you can make snap judgements about how catastrophic performance will be in a loop or whatever. Use that judgement to trend toward low complexity, so that if/when you get to an optimization pass the basics are already sane. \n\n2. Pay close to attention to your intended throughput. Think about how fast this needs to go and how often and how much data it's working on so that you're aware of how much you need to be thinking about #1.

To take a house-building analogy, sometimes you're just the brick layer.  Sometimes you're just assembling pre-fab kits.  Sometimes you're the lead architect who does the design (UX) but also the main drawings and materials selection.  Sometimes you're the consulting engineer who does the stress analysis.\n\nNo, most programmers don't need to know much math, unless the programs you're writing *DO* math.  And even then, usually they'll pair you with a mathematician.  In the same way that the people who make medical software don't know surgery, and the people who make flight software don't fly planes.\n\nThere are times when you have to be ***BOTH*** a domain expert and a programmer.  But, often, in those cases, one or the other suffers.  Trust me; I know guys who work at Lockheed Martin who are one but not the other, and sometimes people who aren't either.  And these are the people making weapons systems designed to kill people.\n\nTL;DR - most programming does not require domain knowledge.  And, the domain is rarely doing math--or even applied math.  And when it does, it's better to work with someone who **IS** a domain expert, and learn to communicate and collaborate.\n\nThere are *MAYBE* a handful of jobs that you'll be given as a new programmer that will involve math.

This subreddit isn't called learnCoding either, it's called learnProgramming.\n\nIMHO what sets a programmer apart from a coder is that a programmer is capable of understanding (software) architecture decisions in their programming field (and maybe even make their own architecture decisions). A mobile app developer has learned the architecture layers of mobile apps, a backend enterprise application programmer has learned how to keep their growing projects maintainable, a frontend dev may know a thing or two about designs, ... .\n\nSo what can you do? Understand that coding is one of many means at a programmer's disposal to achieve something greater. Then get a grasp on which field(s) of programming actually interest you.\n\nIf you like coding, which usually involves breaking down a larger problem into many small steps, you can think of programming as doing the same \"breaking down problems\" into manageable chunks, just at a grander scale. Trust me, it's just as fulfilling to see planned parts of a program work well together as it is to write individual methods that do what they are supposed to do.\n\nIf you still have absolutely no idea what to do, maybe think of a more-than-trivial, less-than-difficult business use-case and implement that into a program with an agile development style. A business use-case doesn't have to be money oriented, it can be anything you'd use in a business, including any open-source software idea that comes to your mind.\n\nWhile/after you get the right mindset how to approach program development, you can return to game development. If you do it right it'll probably involve having/obtaining some math knowledge that you aren't thinking of yet, which is why IMHO business applications are a tad more approachable if you just want to get the right mindset regarding project work, while doing some goal-oriented coding.",

Normally this would be done with a client/server setup.  The client application talks to a server application which then stores the data in the database.  Only the server application has access to the database.\n\nIf your client application has a login process normally you store a password in the database as a hash (SHA128/256/512/1024) of a salt (random data) and the password. The salt and hash is stored in the database.  When someone provides their password it is sent to the server which then grabs the salt, hashes it and the password and makes sure the result matches the hash in the database.\n\nThe salt is to ensure someone can't calculate hashes of common passwords ahead of time and just scan your database for those hash results.  The hash ensures nobody can see the user's password in the database nor can the reverse the hash to find the user's password.\n\nThe salt needs to be random/different between users as well, you don't want two people with the same password having the same hash in the database.",

Leetcode is a very good resource to teach you algorithmic thinking and program optimization. \n\nAnother alternative for when you get decent is to choose an open-source project that you like from github and try to contribute to it, in order to learn about integration and work with real-world systems.

Even if you don't become a full time developer, knowing how to code helps in almost any field.\n\nAs for next language, worry about that later. Get comfortable with Python first. Maybe after 6 months you can think about JavaScript or something else.\n\nYou're not wasting time, just being realistic about the learning curve.

What you need to do is learn to write a function that takes inputs, aka parameters. The basic idea is that you write the code once using the functions parameters, and then you can call the function any number of times with whatever values you want. You can use parameters for anything that you want to be adjustable in the function. If you write a function that draws an enemy, you can use parameters to specify the location of the enemy, but also what color(s) to use, how many legs or teeth the enemy has, and anything else that could change from one enemy to the next.\n\nOnce you‚Äôve got a function that draws the enemy, you can create a list of sets of parameters. Then, you can use a loop to iterate over the list and call the `enemy` function with each set of parameters, and the function will draw all the enemies in the list one at a time.\n\nThis is one of the fundamental ideas in programming. Computers work largely by repeating simple sets of instructions, very very quickly, with different data.",

Those help, and certainly when you're flooded with applicants you can throw resumes in the trash that don't have the technologies you're looking for, but that's an early filter. (which technologies get you past those early filters? that is location dependent as you've already intuited - the only way to know for you area is to check local job boards)\n\nAnother early filter is \"do they have a 4 year degree in CS?\" You don't *need* one but, again, if a company is flooded with applicants you can toss all the resumes without a 4 year degree in the trash and still have plenty of choice. If you don't, you're going to need some networking (as in leveraging and building your network of personal contacts, not TCP/IP!) skills, so work on building those up.\n\nBut the really important things are - can you *think for yourself?* Can you *solve problems?* A lot of young programmers have never really solved problems by themselves, they've either just been following tutorials or, worse, using AI for everything. Once you get past the HR filters, getting through the interview is going to be show that you've got the interpersonal skills every job needs (can you take direction? work as a team? self-motivate?), and then your problem solving and thinking skills.\n\nNot every interview is going to have a \"whiteboard coding\" problem, but all of them are going to try to do something to capture how much skill you have versus just how much you've memorized.",

Recruiter in the tech space (building a tech talent community to upskill + place talent) here, and I work with a lot of junior devs trying to break into the job market.   \n  \nEntry levels are really competitive because of a combination of a couple things: 1) AI is replacing a lot of aspects of a junior role, 2) as a result of the AI influence, companies seemingly want more specialists vs generalists in the market rn (this is my opinion though from speaking with companies and seeing their sentiment), and 3) in general, less companies are looking to spend the time mentoring + training junior talent when they know they can use AI for a certain amount of tasks + hire intermediate/senior talent to come in and hit the ground running right away.\n\nWhat I'd recommend: build your projects and experience in a way that shows your adaptability to pick up new technologies/skills as fast as possible. Show that your insight, productivity, and understanding of how to solve a problem is there, something that AI cannot show! \n\nSome things you can do: build an awesome portfolio website to showcase your projects and present them in a case study like format (showcase your thinking and process), align your resume to the very specific skillset that the company is looking for and if you have some dream roles/companies, building projects very specifically towards that, and most importantly: build up your network. Reach out to people on LinkedIn/reddit/conferences/forums etc and build connections to learn and connect with them. You never know where a connection can lead to - I've had people that I met 6 years ago offer me a great job when I needed it most! \n\nAnd finally, as I always do, you can always check out our talent community where we help you upskill on exactly this and find directly recruited jobs for you (but ofc, you're welcome to apply outside of our community too). If you're interested, here's our website: [https://acetalent.io/join-like-a-monad](https://acetalent.io/join-like-a-monad)\n\nI hope this helps & feel free to ask any more questions!",

In my opinion, the three main things are the following:\n\n* Connect with people in the field. Reach out to them. Ask questions. But most importantly, bring something to the table. Share what you‚Äôre working on or what you‚Äôve learned.\n* Set learning objectives, always with a clear goal in mind. What do you want to achieve? Learning just for the sake of it can be a huge mistake.\n* Explore training programs or curriculums that interest you. Even if you don‚Äôt enroll, look into what they cover. Are you sure you have all the necessary background? One of the biggest challenges for self-learners is dealing with knowledge gaps.\n\nThe ability to self-learn is, in my opinion, one of the strongest signs of both soft and hard skills. **Don‚Äôt doubt your abilities** mate, keep pushing and show the world what you can do. Best of luck :)",

Think about which one interests you the most.\n\nWhat I did was research all of them. AI/ML takes a lot of data science, it's basically fancy statistics and a lot of math. I researched data science and it just didn't interest me, so I skipped it. Same for mobile development, it just didn't interest me as much as backend software development. So, I decided to just stick to backend development as my main path.\n\nSomething to keep in mind is that you don't have to stick to one career. You can make a career change 7 years after getting your first job and go into AI or Cybersecurity or anything you like. You don't have to do one thing, you can grow into different things. \n\nSo, think about it. Which one do you like the most now and which one would you like to do in the future?",

That's what happened to me: I was tasked with just data entry, but I saw the need for an extensive database of all companies in the NYC tri-state area for the data entry personnel, so I purchased a then CD-ROM -based business directory with appropriate data, wrote a custom utility in C++ to convert over a million records into a flat-file database format used by the company, converted all the data on my home PC and handed that huge chunk of data to my boss.

Switching to macOS helped me with moving closer to Linux, but grabbing a cheap laptop from Facebook marketplace and installing a dozen different Linux distros will get you further and faster. I suggest using a separate machine so you can go scorched earth.\n\n**No** because you should stick with whatever you're comfortable moving forward with. People may give up over the tiniest things. DO NOT accidentally kill your interest in programming by changing your environment so much that you lose faith in your foundations.\n\n  \nEdit: Forgot to mention that WSL is pretty good right now. When I'm forced to suffer through Windows I tend to use Git Bash for simple operations and WSL for anything that Git Bash can't handle. These days Git Bash for windows has the option to install a bunch of command-line tools that make life on Windows a bit more linux-like. Can't live without it.",

In C thats\n\n```\nstruct node { \n    int value;\n    struct node *next;\n};\n```\nSo you'd find a lecture set, usually a good place to look is [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63EdVPNLG3ToM6LaEUuStEY&feature=shared), to learn the content, then write your own implementations.",

The exam is unknown so you'll need to use your best judgement and logic to put together a solution. Problem solving logic takes practice of similar questions to really perfect, but once you do it becomes a universal skill.\n\n1. As an exercise that combines these topics, I recommend making a small hangman program. Try reading the word from a .txt file, handling the guessing part in the console, and outputting your final answer + the amount of guesses it took to a new .txt file. This will cover comparing matching values between an answer/guess array.\n2. To cover some basic math and parsing, you could also try reading a string of numbers e.g. \"15326\" from a .txt file, then calculating the average and median (requires sorting), and outputting that to a .txt file.\n\nGood luck on the exam!",

I was doing some different stuff though, I was trying to build a cross platform app because it supposedly does that but I could not get it to recognize the Android API, no matter what I did. I literally spent like 2 days fiddle fucking around with it and could never get it to build an empty template. I switched to flutter and it worked way better. Now, if you were to be targeting only a single platform like Linux desktop then yeah Qt is probably fine. If it were me though I'd still rather try and get Java to run on whatever device you're using and use Javafx for gui before doing Qt again.",

I don‚Äôt trust any other framework as much. The Qt framework has 30 years in the market as a native speed, C++ solution‚Ä¶ 15 years of QML in the market, and it‚Äôs in in cars and medical devices. There‚Äôs a million developers today. That‚Äôs less than half the number of Flutter developers right now, but Flutter is too new for me to trust.\n\nThe next product I‚Äôm working on will be on an LTS Qt 6 release. I researched the options and Qt came out on top for our team.\n\nBTW, if you are making a medical device, it is possible to get a perpetual license, but you must request it. The perpetual license only has 1 year of upgrades, maybe 4 patch releases, but you can modify the source code and fix GUI defects forever. Get at least one perpetual license and enough 3-year subscription licenses to complete the development phase, then get a 1- year upgrade for the perpetual license before going to 510k so you pick up the latest patch release versions. With the perpetual license, you will be locked to the highest versions available when the 1-year expires, but you can always  get another 1-year upgrade for the perpetual license to pick up later patch releases or newer versions for future products.",

How do you find the ease of maintaining your product in Qt after a new major version release (e.g., going from Qt 5 to Qt 6)? Do you generally migrate your existing products to newer major versions, or do you tend to stick with the LTS version you started with?

One piece of advice I can think of though that I didn't stumble into myself was that an engineer once said they view passing self/this to a method/function to be a smell. I hadn't considered that and I don't even really know why it's true if it is. Maybe it's true because it reveals a potentially unnecessary bi-directional dependency/coupling. Sometimes I can't figure out a way to prevent this where the pros outweigh the cons but sometimes I can and in those cases it seems to result in a much better design.\n\n2) Not advice per se, but, If I go back, as in really really far back to before I programmed professionally, I saw somebody diagram a program top-down before implementing it. This indirectly resulted in organizing the procedures by level of abstraction and exposed a mental model of the program to latch onto while implementing it. Thinking of things that way (or bottom-up works, too) felt like it unblocked me to create much more complex programs before drowning in my own mess.\n\n3) Some advice I got but debatably not \"software engineering\" advice, I would say it was actually a soft-skills thing. A product manager mentioned to me after a meeting that instead of saying things like \"we can't do that\" it would be more helpful/productive to say things like \"Do you think X would be a problem if we do that?\"\n\nIn other words, it really matters how people feel as a result of technical back-and-forth. I think this can be overlooked if you only interact with engineers. Seems obvious in retrospect but this helped me be more effective when communicating with non-engineers which actually made me a more effective technical lead as well.\n\nI think in certain types of software projects cross-team communication of technical mental models around the problem solution is crucial. So this was a breakthrough for me and arguably made me a better software engineer than any technical advice I'd ever received.\n\nSo I would say to your \"but I wonder if there's more\", YMMV but I would advise to focus on people stuff and notice that people problems are actually more likely to kill certain projects than technical decisions are. And also along those lines I think for certain projects the value is actually more in the understanding of the problem/proposed solution and effective communication around it than the implementation itself is.",

A gazillion people, many non technical, but also other devs, will want you to include something, make something happen.

I need just one more feature!\"*\n\nNo. Fuck that. Not gonna happen. Too many projects, industry and FOSS, die because of feature creep, because codebases bloat- and then blow-up.\n\nAnd people don't prevent it, because a yes-man seems to have an easier time getting ahead in his career than someone saying no, because coporate shills and useless consultants have poisoned modern corporate culture portraying saying \"No\" as something evil.\n\n----\n\n*\"Any methodology becomes useless when it becomes an ideology.\"*\n\nThis is true for everything, but by far the worst offenders of this in programming, are OOP, TDD, FP, and early optimization. The fetishization of \"memory safety\" that some acolytes of a certain language that shall remain unnamed are carrying before them like a holy relic, is a close runner up.\n\nAll of these are useful.

My first advice is to go in knowing your audience and what they expect and to tailor your level of detail to that audience. If the audience is non-technical or time is short, it's best to just give a recommendation or answer and let them ask questions. Maybe list the possible choices with a few pros and cons first. If it's an hour long review of said recommendation with a client technical team, be ready to go through the twenty considerations that led to that recommendation as they want you to be thorough. Teaching really does help. After you've explained polymorphism to freshman a few dozen times with a worked example, you can do it with an interviewer who already knows it pretty easily.\n\nMy other suggestion is that you want to keep a conversation going but at the same time it's fine to pause and frame your answer. There's a video of Tim Cook taking a question at a shareholder meeting where he literally sits at a conference table for almost a minute thinking before giving a twenty second answer. It was complicated and he wanted to check all the angles in his head and decide how to phrase his answer succinctly.\n\nIt's fine to use a whiteboard or paper if needed as long as you're not being rude. I get interview questions about how I'd design something complex and I'll do that with the interviewer. We'll basically sketch the landscape and they'll add things and ask questions as we go around.\n\nI will also stress that BSing technical interviewers usually doesn't work. You may be able to lie to them, but your answer will still be technically wrong and they'll just think you're confidently mistaken. I like people who say they don't know and tell me how they'd find out as long as the question wasn't too foundational. I say a lot of things like \"I've never used that product, but I assume it has X/works like X/can integrate using X/runs on X, right? If so, I'd find the docs and plan to implement it using \\[high level approach that works with the underlying tech\\].\" If it's weird they'll just tell me and I'll give an answer that works with the weird. Show you know the first principle or pattern and can learn new things.",

Don't hate yourself just because you failed an interview. I flat out froze up in my first two interviews, it happens.\n\nThe way you improve is by first looking up mock interviews on YouTube, and learning what a \"good job candidate\" is even supposed to look / sound like during a coding / behavioral / systems design interview. This is not one of those things that's \"obvious\" in the sense that you should \"just know\", especially if you don't come from a white collar background and aren't used to presenting yourself as a professional. You gotta at least see a good example.\n\nAfter that, you gotta do what you can to prep. Look up \"X interview questions\". Replace X with Python, Java, Springboot, Javascript, React; whatever you think may be relevant based on the job description. You usually don't need to be extremely thorough, just some skimming to be sort of mentally and emotionally prepared for the kinds of questions you're going to run into. If the questions do seem wildly off from what you know, just do the homework and try your best to study up.\n\nAnd beyond that, you need to be honest with yourself. Did you really know the answer, just not how to phrase it? I did a lot of random LeetCode / Hackerrank before I even did my first coding interview. I knew ***nothing*** about DSA though, I relied entirely on my intuition to solve problems. That ultimately meant I was bad at doing coding interviews, and I had to swallow my pride and work through neetcode before I got to a good spot with coding interviews.\n\nEdit: I also verbalize everything when I interview prep. I'm not a naturally good speaker, so I try to talk through everything to be good enough for interviews. It's important to not talk too \"hastily\" though, you typically want to talk like you're trying to hold a conversation.",

As long as you're aware of that, though, and have the instinct to check something with primary sources or \"up to date\" references that needs to be checked, I don't think this is as much of a problem as some people seem to make it out to be.\n\nNext, you cannot do common computing tasks on a book like \"Search\" (at least not in a print version). But for this, there is \"the table of contents\" and \"the index\" which may seem quaint but are actually better for learning, in my opinion. If you go to the index to find a term, for example, then your eyes will encounter other related terms and you'll naturally want to look up a few more and to increase your knowledge.\n\nPersonally I like the feeling of holding a book and flipping through pages. At least, to me it feels a lot more enjoyable than scrolling through pages on a screen. Maybe it's just because I use a computer for work so much, that doing something on the computer (looking at document) feels like \"work\", whereas looking at a book on paper (even about programming) feels like not work, even if some aspects of a physical book are more laborious, such as flipping pages or finding the correct page number.",

That is why everyone always suggests doing projects, because then you apply your recently gained knowledge, and then you learn!\n\nBooks have the downside that it is tempting to skip through the boring stuff, and only read whatever confirms what you already know. They can give you a feeling that you totally understand things, because the book explains it so nicely.\n\nInteractive tutorials like free code camp and others, have the downside that they only ask you to answer predefined questions, and you risk becoming like a monkey pressing switches, without any idea of why or what you are doing. And since they tend \"finish\" every topic without ever returning, you forget the first things you \"learned\" before the course is complete.\n\nVideo tutorials are mostly just watching someone else repeating a project they have done before - kind of like watching someone play a game they've already completed. It can be great for actually seeing what is going on, but like in life, there's a huge difference between seeing someone else doing things, and do them yourselves.\n\nMy recommendation is to look around, try some different things, see what you like, and then focus on applying the knowledge to projects where you can't just fast-forward or skip to the page with the solution. Then you are learning!",

I'd say with Go there's a slightly higher chance the interviewer wouldn't be as familiar with Go and might ask you a question about your syntax. Should be fine if you're good at it, though.\n\nPicking C as your primary language for interviews can occasionally be a weakness. While C is a great language, there are some things that are just a lot more tedious in C. Just about any problem that involves appending strings, for example, is more tedious in C, especially if you want it to work with arbitrary sizes and handle errors correctly - whereas C++ and Go have nice high-level string objects that you can easily split, append, and so on.\n\nIt depends on the problem.

It's more similar to a ternary operator than an if statement, just less cryptic.\n\nYou can also do pattern matching on function arguments; for example, if a function takes a list, you can do\n\n    foo :: [a] -> b -- function type declaration\n    foo (firstelem:rest) = -- something that splits off the first element and does whatever with the rest\n    foo _ = -- something that is evaluated when the first pattern isn't met (ie, the list is empty and there is no first element to split off)\n\n(anything after `--` is a comment in Haskell)\n\nMonads/Functors/Applicatives can also be used for flow control; effectively, you can execute a function on an input only if everything upstream didn't encounter issues.",

If there are designers, they will take care of most UX/design thinking, but you do get to participate and offer suggestions.\n\nDesigners often work out of figma or similar apps, which don‚Äôt really behave exactly like a browser, so they do need the programmers help. Designers also often expect people to behave predictably, and there always those ppl who don‚Äôt. \n\nI happen to have degrees in both engineering and graphic design and can tell you: if you enjoy coding , FE will be your cozy niche. If you enjoy creating the visual interface and interactions, but coding in general bores you, stick with graphic design.\n\nI CAN do some BE in Java, but it bores the hell out of me because it‚Äôs so predictable and stable and mostly boilerplate. Which is why I have never gone fullstack, and will continue to avoid it hopefully until I retire. FE is chaotic and I love it. It‚Äôs always new, every interface has its own problems to solve, ready-made component libraries only get you so far and sometimes they introduce more problems than they solve, and that one goal of less than 2 seconds to page fully loaded really keeps me going. Doing a website with React is easy, keeping those page loads under control is priceless.",

The ideal candidate knows several languages and can use the right tool for the job.\n\nFor now I'd say don't stress about what language you pick because you shouldn't be learning only one. Python, C++ and Java are all excellent choices for a first language. Pick any one and learn it. Then plan on learning more so you're well-rounded.",

WebGL has multiple versions and a bunch of extensions, and shares GLSL with other graphics APIs (Vulkan and OpenGL), each with their own versions - which ends up creating a mine field for LLMs.\n\nTrying to build something outside of your current abilities is a good way to grow though, it'll show you real quick where the gaps in your knowledge are and give you something to work on!

When you do an operation like copyto, the underlying code performs a loop requesting the amount of bytes to fill the buffer, it then moves those bytes to the specified destination. If the amount of bytes received was less than the number of bytes requested then it repeats the operation fetch operation until the number of bytes received is less than the number of bytes requested.\n\nThe idea being that some streams have an overhead for reading or writing, by reading a chunk at a time (rather than a byte at a time) you can avoid a lot of that overhead.\n\n  \nAlso have a look at r/csharp.

English has been the lingua franca of tech for long enough that the people in my teams all have a reasonably high grasp of the language but what people mean with the words changes radically. If you ask \"will you get this done by Thursday?\" a German might answer \"Unlikely\" and an Indian might answer \"Yes, sure, no problem\" - and both mean the same thing. And humour is of course an even worse rabbit hole.\n\n> sometimes you find that you use the same words or phrases every time\n\nSpecifically for this, remember that tech people like well-defined meanings. The whole \"use a thesaurus to avoid repeating yourself\" thing that English majors do in prose is actively frowned upon in comp-sci works. If you mean the same thing, use the same word again.\n\nAlso what happens in real settings is that rarely used words are just not as present as other vocab, so we either need to think for a bit (either to mentally translate or to search for the word) and this is bloody exhausting. Just reusing the smaller core vocab is kind of a defence mechanism then.\n\n> Listening, especially when there are native speakers, provides some challenges. By the time you understand something, the topic has moved on.\n\nBloody Welsh people. Yeah, natives with strong accents are very hard to understand.

Lying in the interview is what got me two offers.\n\nI think lying in interviews just does both of us a disservice. I think it's important that we both know what we're getting into. I want to be able to actually do my job after getting it. Nobody would even give me a second interview if I didn't talk up my senior/lead experience. I was being honest. I have some experience leading projects. I'm very comfortable with it. I am not a person with *years* of lead/senior level work, though, and that's what they wanted to hear.\n\nSo I spent a few days running through the stories I had of my experience, and I rewrote them under the guise of *being* my tech lead. Same story, different angle. I know all the decisions we made on those projects, because I was a part of them. I didn't *make* the decisions, but now, in my stories, I did.\n\nI went from getting past recruiter screens 1/10 times to 10/10 times. It felt a lot more like interviewing 5 years ago. I still failed a lot of the later stages, but I don't care about having a 100% success rate. I only needed one job.\n\nIf the rest of the market is lying, then you have to lie as well.

I think for that point it should be noted to not outright lie about things that can be verified (like schooling, certs, places you've worked, etc) however, embellishing your current (or immediate past) role is absolutely a must.   \n  \nIts important that you can speak confidently to that, however, so make sure you can answer questions about it at atleast an intermediate level in an interview setting. And this can also tie into your point on doing personal projects, which you can use that experience to fluff up your current role but it'll be worth much more if its part of your job experience (in an enterprise setting) than if its just a personal/home project.",

When I first started I would literally filter jobs on linkedIn to states nobody wanted to live in, like Ohio. You will be given jobs in locations that people don't even know exist. A lot of them have barely any applicants. If they are desperate enough they will hire you. Another tip would be to update your resume to have your location be within the same area, since companies might filter you if you are located too far away\n\nIt's a good tip. *Even if you don't like the idea of living there*.\n\nAs you'd only be there for a couple of years or so, then you're equipped with a 100x stronger CV because now you *have experience* (vs **none**), and you can make an attempt to return back to one of your preferred cities.\n\nThis is a far better plan than never even being able to start your tech career at all.\n\n>  **7. Interview advice: be honest but not too honest**\n\nThink of it as like going on a date. Should you be honest during a date? Yes, of course, *especially if* you wish to have a long term relationship with them (such as is the case with landing a job! You want this not as a one week long fling but to work there for years and years?). \n\nBut you also want to show ***your best side*** during a date, don't be **brutally** honest.\n\n> **8. Do not negotiate**\n\nDepends on the person, as you can only negotiate if you're coming in from a position of strength. Are you ready to walk away? 95%+ of the people complaining on this subreddit are not in this position of strength, and thus shouldn't ever try to negotiate.",

You can always learn something new, so take the opportunity and run with it.",

I work on systems far older than I, some as old as 50 years old.  There's programs we support written in the 70s that are 140,000 lines long and none of us have any idea what it does - but it runs every night without fail, so we just leave it alone haha.\n\nWill this put you in a \"hole\" for COBOL only?  Somewhat - the experience you gain on the mainframe is not directly relatable to other tech stacks like the cloud.  On the other hand the mainframe tech stack is much more stable than the cloud and thus your job is too and I always see mainframe roles open online for banks, insurance, government, financial companies, and larger/older retailers.\n\nI've done Mainframe Dev for a decade.  I've seen 4 migration attempts to the magical land of \"cloud\", with all kinds of unicorn farts and rainbows promised with it.  I've seen all 4 fail.\n\nWhen I was getting into it all my Computer Science class, even the professors were saying \"What the heck are you doing COBOL for?  That's ancient, it's going away, it's useless\".  Meanwhile I interned at a shop (mainframe companies are called \"shops\") over the summer and was offered a job in my Sophomore year once I graduate.  I literally had a job lined up 2 years before graduation.\n\nIn my experience coding will be 25% of your time.\n\nAn additional 25% is people that aren't mainframers (business folks, other coders) asking you \"Why did the mainframe spit out this value?\"\n\nThe remaining 50% of the time is using Intertest and your brain to step through decades old business logic and in the process learn both the program and the actual business you support.\n\nThis \"business knowledge\" will make you a critical to their business to the point they can't afford to lose you.\n\nI still play some in the distributed sandbox, debugging C# program error, updating Java classes for mandatory upgrades, and small at-home Node projects.\n\nGiven how my life turned out, I would give it a shot.",

        "body": "I keep hearing and seeing this question everywhere and want to answer this once and for all.\n\n1. The United States is a much wealthier country than most of the developed world. Look at [this link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income) of disposable income after transfers - the US is literally 50% ahead of even many wealthy European countries, and nearly double that of South Korea. So part of the reason why American wages are higher than that of Canada is the same reason why American wages are higher than that of Nigeria or Pakistan.\n2. Silicon Valley emerged as the global tech capital due to unique historical timing. While Europe and Asia were rebuilding from WW2, the US had intact infrastructure and universities pumping out engineers. Stanford, Berkeley, and the defense industry created this perfect storm in the Bay Area thanks to much looser non-compete agreement laws in California (read the story of the [Traitorous eight.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traitorous_eight) Basically a bunch of elite engineers who left some batshit crazy micromanager's firm realized they could only create their own startups by staying in California due to them not enforcing non-competes, and ended up founding Intel and Kleiner Perkins - which funded Amazon, Google, Sun Microsystems, and basically jumpstarted the modern VC scene). By the time other countries caught up industrially in the 70s-80s, Silicon Valley had already established itself as THE place for tech innovation.\n3. This created a self-reinforcing cycle that‚Äôs nearly impossible to break. Top talent moved to Silicon Valley ‚Üí venture capitalists followed the talent ‚Üí successful companies emerged ‚Üí created more high-paying jobs ‚Üí attracted more top talent. Repeat for 50 years. Now you have the densest concentration of tech talent, capital, and successful companies on Earth all competing for the same workers.\n4. The US has a massive advantage other countries can‚Äôt replicate: 340 million people in a single market with one language, one currency, and one set of regulations. A startup in San Francisco can instantly sell to someone in Florida. Meanwhile, a startup in France has to deal with 27 different EU regulations, multiple languages, and a much smaller domestic market. Canadian startups have to follow separate securities regulation for every province dramatically limiting scaling. This scale creates far more valuable companies that can afford to pay more. This effect also explains why sky high pay is available for elite engineers when adjusting for COL in India and China.\n5. The regulatory environment in the US is far more favorable than other countries. European bankruptcy laws until very recently would destroy you personally, while Chapter 11 bankruptcies were very lax. At-will employment means companies can hire aggressively knowing they can pivot if needed. This risk-friendly environment creates more unicorns, which drives up wages for everyone as they compete for talent.\n\nAll of these factors combined together supercharge American wages across all sectors of the economy compared to other even developed nations.",

She recently invited me to a night out with some of her other doctor friends in the area, and you wanna know how early we planned it? *Three months ahead of time*.\n\nThat's the time she needed to get all of their schedules and time offs aligned just to have a single Saturday open for a full night of plans.\n\nWhereas for me *all* of my Saturdays are open.

That's not to say that you shouldn't document and do proper design, but balance and know when to prioritize a less perfect solution that solves the problem.\n\nAlso FAANG tries to build everything from the ground up. Need a pipeline to load data from X place? Cool, let's build it. Orchestration? Sure, maybe we get an open source tool that requires some time to set up. Or build our own taking a quarter to do so. Or use the in-house solution that does not rely on external libraries and no one else outside of the company knows.\n\nStartups are messy and sometimes cannot wait for that clean code that only uses internal libraries, passes compliance and security requirements in all known legislations including countries where they don't even have customers and optimize for the best design and algorithmic solution at the cost of spending more time planning.\n\nLastly if nothing works it is totally okey to change companies or to leave the startup world to go a regular employer where the pace is the right for you. Even if you don't get a fancy stock package (that might be worth 0...), your mental health is important.\n\nPS: some startups would rather hire from other other startup than FAANG precisely because FAANG tend to house in-house tools and focus on building from the ground up instead of just using a vendor.\n\nPS 2: IMO, 2.5 years at a FAANG probes you are a capable engineer.

That's like... Principal SWE at least, and those roles aren't frequently hired externally. They may even be more of a fit for a Senior PM or an EM role.\n\nBut a regular run of the mill Senior SWE role? They're not gonna want to touch somebody like that with a 10 foot pole. They're too expensive. That person's shooting way below their belt if they're just looking for a \"senior dev\" job that isn't extremely specialized and niche to actually *utilize* their background.\n\nIf I had that experience, and I were trying to apply to \"regular\" jobs, I'd be fudging my resume to make myself look like the type of candidate that gets hired into those \"regular\" jobs.

Their 10 years as an AI/ML scientiest may or may not be relevant either. So that would leave them with... 13 years of SWE? It might be a bit telling they didn't bother to mention SWE experience at all, and focused on a bunch of qualifications and non-SWE roles in their rant. I'm just making assumptions here though\n\nI have 12 YOE, and I apply to Senior SWE roles and get them just fine. Even in the market of 2024, which is when I last job hopped. When I can do the job just fine... why would they try to hire someone with 38 YOE that's probably asking double or triple my salary?\n\nIf I had 38 YOE, I don't think I'd be targetting the same roles I'm targetting today.

Pay is kinda garbage, knew a guy twice my age at the time bragging about making $115k, but he also barely did anything and was hunt and peck typing.\n\nThere‚Äôs so many of these dudes I know who sit around bragging about working on military aircraft projects. \n\nI just don‚Äôt understand anyone not being retired by then. I didn‚Äôt get any good money until like 28 and I‚Äôm still looking at retiring by 40-45. Sure if you were in one of those embedded jobs being cushy maybe, but you‚Äôd have your nice that‚Äôs kind of insulated. In big tech, a few years of RSUs and you should have a paid off house and retirement sorted.",

But then COVID hit and a bunch of tech jobs moved here, and it made the housing market go completely batshit crazy - and it was largely because a bunch of people with a bunch of money flooded the market.\n\nAt the same time, that drove salaries up - because to afford working in Austin, you need to afford living in Austin. The issue was that salaries didn't increase in every sector - so teachers and government workers got completely fucked. But us in tech? Doing great.\n\nNow, Silicon Valley and NYC are a different story - those are cities where that cycle of salaries -> people -> housing has been going on for decades now. Now things are someone shifting because jobs are moving out of Silicon Valley to lower cost areas, and that implications of that are going to be complicated.\n\nNow, offshoring - yes, it's 100% tied to cost of living differences. Not just housing - it's also food, services, healthcare, etc. But the same issue above at a city level also happens at a country level - countries with great quality of life and resources can offer better pay to attract more talented people who then have more money to spend on goods and services, etc.\n\nI do agree that the US has a ton of opportunities to lower cost of living - and I think you're right that housing is a big one (with healthcare being the other one).\n\nAnd I think you're also right that the nimby movement is extremely damaging to our ability to deliver affordable housing.

How cheap do you actually think good offshore devs really are? Latin Americans are now being paid almost as much as Western Europeans nowadays. Talented senior devs in India are making six figures. The truth is that offshore salaries have increased a lot in the past few years because as more work gets offshored the costs go up since there are only so many quality devs out there. Also, an effect of that is that the cost of living in places like Latin America, Eastern Europe, India, etc. is increasing because now that they have more money to spend, realtors can now increase the prices of rent and houses over there. So the cost of living in different countries compared to the US is not a static thing, and I think that there is good reason to believe that the cost of living abroad is going to catch up.",

Sometimes you just need better work-life balance and actual teammates instead of being a one-person army.\n\nMy advice: don't make any big decisions while you're burned out.

Take a couple PTO days when there aren't any looming deadlines and get loaded or play Castlevania or whatever it is young people do to blow off steam this days.",

They just don't have the support structure in place to help a junior get their footing which sets them up for either failure, burn out or both. I would use whatever PTO time you may have to take a break in the short term. Do something you like, something that will completely take you away from work. In the long term I would seriously consider switching jobs. I understand that it's easier said than done in the current market but at least with a current job it might make it easier and if you can pull it off it will be worthwhile in the long term. If you're getting burned out this early in your career, then that's a sign that something is really badly wrong as burn out rarely goes away on its own without major changes. So make the necessary change before you completely burn out.",

Meant to be harsh to show you why you likely haven't gotten interviews.\n\n1) tech lead should be capitalized, put Technical Lead\n\n2) \"I was responsible\", not necessary. The way I was taught was that one bullet should be one line.\n\n3) How does \"responsible for making technical decisions on behalf of my team\" help market you?\n\n4) Is this anonymized? \"Making the initial design and POC for a new project\" is useless information that tells me nothing about you. \n\n5) Created a custom virtualization engine. Ok, we're getting somewhere. What is this?\n\n6) Why is Google uncapitalized?\n\n7) api is not a word. Capitalize to API.\n\n8) Move stack to bottom. Why is there Stack on the first two experiences, but Technologies used on the 3rd one?\n\n9) Your first experience tells me nothing about you. What's a project you worked on? What was your impact? Do you know what your impact was? How could you be unemployed since April and not put anything towards this? \"Worked on a custom virtualization engine that improved performance by X% (before/after). Designed and developed API responsible for XYZ that reduced costs by X%\"\n\n10) Python, Linux, Jenkins, all should be capitalized, they're proper nouns\n\n11) \"This includes writing code, managing other people's tasks, and the bureaucracy of getting multiple teams on the same page\". This doesn't tell me anything. Did you design anything? Sounds like you were a junior engineer changing CSS colors, talking over a scrum board, and sending out emails. Am I wrong? Tell me *why*.\n\n12) First sub-bullet point is better. The only positive I see here. Make this more concise. \"Parallelized test suites and reduced run time by 80% from 10 to 2.5 hours\"\n\n13) \"As part of suite optimization. I also made a custom partitioning service\". It's a casual resume, but the grammar needs to be better. Speak in active voice and not passive voice. \"Created a custom partitioning service to optimize tests...\" \n\n14) Why do you give such useless info? \"This role included leadership responsibilities.\" That tells me nothing about what you did. \"Mentored and helped onboard new engineers by creating a X day plan, writing documents, pair programming\"\n\n15) \"And more\". Wtaf? \n\n16) \"Jenkins (Also jenkins api)\" lol\n\n17) Software *e*ngineer. Capitalize.\n\n18) Why is feb lowercase?\n\n19) You wasted a whole line to tell me what the italics of \"Software engineer\" told me. Useless summary in this bullet here.\n\n20) \"for internal use, for department's team use\"... ok. What did it do? One time I sent a LMGTFY link to someone at work for C# documentation, I could write \"Worked on a custom script that linked to documentation for internal team use\n\n21) \"Currently slowly taking courses in mathematics\" is just bad. Just list your courses and say they're in progress.\n\n22) cpp/c? Do you think the shift or caps lock button exists to be used when you feel like it?\n\n23) You told me you used Python... 5 times over this resume.\n\n24) Skills: \"Decision making\" leads to this type of resume?\n\n25) \"Working with vague requirements\" but made the most vague resume possible",

QA is pretty much dead and SRE ate a quarter of it (How do you install Selenium on a build box?) and normal SWE work ate the other 3/4ths.

Almost 20 candidates have made it to the final loop and nobody was good enough to hire. We're not even asking for a lot; just some typical Leetcode medium/OOP/system design/behaviorals.\n\nNot sure why this sub's experiences tend to be negative.

        "body": "You might need to think about if you hate this specific job, or if you hate \"working\".\n\nDaily standups, time tracking, etc are all pretty standard in the industry. If those things are draining to you... even if you take a year off to refresh, you're just going to immediately get drained again once you start working again after the break.\n\nThat's why I always recommend *against* people wondering if they should go for the nuclear option of taking a year off in order to combat burnout. Taking a year off will feel amazing, you'll be super happy during that year, but you're going to just burnout again the moment you get back. Taking a year off will not be a magic fix. You need to try and actually fix the root cause of your issue. Taking a year off is treating the short-term symptoms, not the long-term root cause.\n\nI hate working. I only work so that I can afford to live my actual life. I have a very clear separation between my work life and my personal life. I don't like daily standups, I don't like time tracking, I don't like pointless meetings, I don't like having to be available 9-5 M-F. I don't think anybody does. But we all do it with the understanding that yeah, some of it sucks, but we do those things because we get a deposit into our bank account every other week that lets us afford the things we actually like doing.\n\nAs for where you're in your career, it's also not a smart move. You have a year of experience. That puts you firmly into the \"entry level\" category, which is objectively the most difficult category to be job searching in. When you're that early into your career, everything is very fragile. Taking a year long break now, versus taking a year long break when you have 5 YOE are completely different. When you're mid-level, you have a lot more stability, and your re-entry into the industry will be *significantly* easier.\n\nAll that said, it's also not a smart move financially. Early in your life is when the money you save is most important. The money you put into a mutual fund today is going to be worth *a ton* when you're older. The more money we have stashed away, the more money we make. The rich get richer. When you intentionally nuke your entire life savings to do a big year long trip, that's a decision that extends far beyond the immediate impact. Sure, immediately you lose $X. But you also are losing a very significant amount of unrealized income that would've made if you had kept that money invested.\n\nEven setting aside the income aspect, money you have saved is supposed to be your emergency fund. Sure you can afford to live for a year without income... but what if something unexpected happens, as often happens in life? What if god forbid you get into a car crash? Now you need to buy a new car, and you have 5-6 figures of medical bills. What if your sister has a destination wedding? Now you get to decide if you want to miss your sisters wedding, or shorten your vacation to be 8 months instead of 12. What if a million other things pop up? Financial planning isn't about the \"happy path\".\n\nI'm all for taking a year off, traveling, living your life, etc. But I think you need to do it for the right reasons, and you need to understand all the costs and risks associated with it. Personally, I would wait until I had at least 5+ YOE before even considering something like that. If my job sucks, I'll find another job, not take a year off. Anecdotally I have enough money saved up to live for over *a decade* without income. But I still understand it'd be a massive financial decision to actually go voluntarily unemployed. Having the money to do that, doesn't mean you *should* do that.",

It doesn't really stand out and it doesn't have a wow factor imo. In fact, i would argue that there are so many people enrolled or graduated from OMSCS that even people who graduate from the in-person MSCS program at GA Tech are now mistaken for having it done online. Most hiring managers aren't stupid. We know it's online. If you were living in California or Texas at the same time you were getting your master's from GA Tech, we know it's online.\n\nHowever, like I said, the education itself is fine, so if you are just concerned about the quality of the education rather than the prestige, it's still a good program.

Even at big tech companies with rubrics and strict criteria for assessments, the human factor is still the dominant component. The overwhelming bias is to hire who we want to work with.. Now, a corporation could never admit it, but that's the basic truth: sales skills matter tremendously. People who come across as easy to get along with, humble, and earnestly interested in the companies problem carry a massive advantage.\n\nWhat I see in a lot of junior engineers is good tech skills, but not great public speaking or sales skills.

Who their biggest competitors are. What they‚Äôve been working on or released in the last year.\n\nRead the fucking job description and be prepared to answer any interview questions around the reqs as well as posible. If they have a ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù section do some research on some of the topics. Maybe put together a small project or a larger project design doc including some of them. It will at least get you thinking about how they might be using that particular skill to solve a current issue or what they might be trying to do to improve a current problem.\n\nThink and research how they might solve some of their more technical problems. Come up with some questions around them. ‚ÄúHow do you prioritize x‚Äôs backlog when z seems to change often and requires a lot of maintenance.‚Äù Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask the hard questions. ‚ÄúWith Company A partnering with Company B to build a platform that allows users to do X. What strategies are being considered to compete in that space?‚Äù\n\nThis is the kind of shit that‚Äôll separate two candidates that performed equally well on the technical parts. And if they can‚Äôt give you a solid answer just know that it‚Äôs a potential red flag about the product and company.\n\nNot saying you do this for every application but if you get a recruiter callback on a company you are excited about, do more than just the minimum otherwise you won‚Äôt stand out.",

I only did less than 120 Neetcode problems because I already got interviews scheduled before I'm able to finish them. Surprising things that happened:\n\n1. My earliest resume that is not really polished and kinda embarrassing got the attention of a FAANG company, another FAANG-adjacent company, and a mid-tier but large multinational company. They are interested even though they would need to do visa sponsorship (non-US).\n\n2. I failed a lot in my initial interviews at multiple companies (including the only FAANG) since I'm really rusty with interviewing. I was so burned out by the experience, I try to not be such a tryhard anymore. I go into interviews thinking I wouldn't be able to clear it anyway, but at least I'll get free mock interviews with the best engineers in the industry. I faced a lot of unfamiliar tech questions, but I try to do bruteforce and optimize based on patterns that I know. I answered behavioral questions as transparent as possible even though it wouldn't put me in the best light. After the interviews, the recruiter will give me great feedback especially on the behavioral questions, which I thought I obviously bombed. Coding interviews and system designs are also mostly positive, only I bombed the FAANG-adjacent one due to communication issues I think.\n\nJust like you, I think luck does play a major factor in my process. I didn't get into FAANG (or adjacent), but got a few decent offers. I'll keep grinding for the future opportunities. Whoever is reading this, don't give up, I hope things will be better for you.",

Once your reputation is established, you can switch back to normal\n\nCongrats again, and go night owls!!",

The fact that you're doing full-stack work right out the gate is hugee. Most new grads get pigeonholed into one tiny piece of the system. You're getting exposure to legacy systems, modern React, cloud migrations, testing... that's honestly a pretty well rounded foundation.\n\nAt Metana we see a lot of people get caught up thinking they need to learn every new framework. But honestly, the fundamentals you're building, understanding systems, debugging, working with teams, matter way more than knowing the latest JavaScript framework.\n\nFor leveling up income, give it 12-18 months then start looking around. Having real experience under your belt changes everything in negotiations. The fact that you've worked in sales is actually a huge advantage most developers don't have.\n\nYour current setup sounds like a great place to build solid foundations without the pressure cooker environment of some tech companies.

If you want to start working almost immediately, consider staffing firms, as they can usually get you in somewhere the same week. It might not be the best job or the best pay for the first 90 or so days before you go permanent, but I've found that's a short amount of time in grand scheme of things. If you have no interest in that, though, then yeah, just keep applying and preparing for interviews.",

Same goes for other big companies like IBM and Qualcomm.

What most big employers do (banks, insurance companies, pharma, etc.) is that they choose 2 or 3 ESN's to work with as preferred vendors based on bids they offer for that position. The tender requires they have x number of employees, that they have been in business for n number of years, and that they exceed a revenue level. They also require they charge no more than some ridiculously lowball rate like 250 euros a day. \n\nOnce the three vendors have been selected, an independent contractor \\*must\\* go through one of them. Even that is hard because many of the big clients demand that the ESN's only send them employees of their firm. They do that so contractors can't just up and quit without giving 3 months of notice. \n\nSo, even if you're the best in your field, the guru; you'll never be able to get a decent rate because even the ESNs' hands are tied by their contractual obligation to only charge the agreed upon amount.",

Many highly educated and smart people with quantitative bent want to get in on this. And then there's everyone else and their mothers who want in.\n\n\nFor ML engineering, it's honestly not that much advanced math. You need to know the basics like correlation or p-value, but these aren't advanced concepts imo. There's a point that comes where there's a sudden diminishing return for learning all the math. It's still¬† fundamentally a software engineering job. You will get more ROI by learning Docker than reading the latest reinforcement learning paper.\n\n\nThere's definitely training of models but that's not all. You oftentimes just call third party APIs like OpenAI. Or you are building out data/cloud infra to support your model development or deployment. Or maybe you are writing Flask API endpoints to deploy your model. Like I said, it's a fundamentally software engineering role so it's not that different.",

I have only a masters degree and entered the field before it was so trendy. It depends what job you want to do.\n\n2) There are some positions that are basically research only. So yes super maths heavy, its not just training the model, they build the model.\n\n3) Other roles are more applied, but you still need a lot of maths, you need a solid understanding of the models and the statistics behind them. You usually focus on finding solutions for business problems. For example, the current models might not work well on the specific use case that your company need. Perhaps you can fix this by transforming the data, maybe you need another model, or maybe a call with that PhD guy who wrote his thesis on that corner case\n\n4) You are also often expected to know about back-end and cloud stuff; again to make sure your models are brining value\n\n\nSome love their job, but for me its just been exhausting - its fun to have a fast pace for a bit‚Ä¶ but now it just doesn‚Äôt stop.

(Edit: Some have moved on the ML roles at other companies. It's the first ML job that's the hard part.)\n- What do you call a lot of math? It's probably a lot of math from the perspective of someone asking if something is a lot of math. It tends to be some fairly basic probability and statistics. (Let's put it this way... I have a math PhD. You have quite possibly taken more probability or stats than I have. I do, however, have the ability to catch up fast when I need to.)\n- What do I do? Designing models, training models, analyzing experiments, building data pipelines, integrating the model with the service that uses it. I'm honestly not sure the last time I called an API in the webdev sense. That said, the backend work isn't all that different from webdev, though it's not a CRUD application (but then neither is all webdev). I touch the frontend or mobile like once every five years (generally to send some tracking data back).",

The mental health stuff is no joke and honestly sounds like you went through something really intense with that whole family situation realization.\n\nLook, the 3 year gap thing... yeah it's gonna come up in interviews but it's not the career killer you think it is. I've seen people with way bigger gaps get hired, especially in tech. The key is how you frame it. You don't need to go into all the personal details. Just say you took some time to deal with family issues and explore entrepreneurship, then pivot quickly to what you learned and why you're ready now.\n\nThe fact that you were getting recruiter calls right after graduation tells me your technical foundation is solid. CS First Class from a good uni + those A-levels? That doesn't just disappear. But yeah, 3 years is long enough that you'll probably need to refresh some skills.\n\nThis might be controversial but have you considered doing a bootcamp to get back up to speed quickly? I've heard Metana actually get a fair number of people who already have CS degrees that wants to update their skills or switch to a different stack. It's way faster than trying to self-study everything and the structure might help given what you've been through mentally.\n\nThe business thing with your friend though even if it didn't work out, you learned something about building products and working with customers. That's actually valuable experience, don't discount it.\n\nFor the immediate job hunt, maybe start with some contract work or shorter term projects? Less scrutiny on the gap, gets you back in the game, and you can build up recent references. Once you have 6-12 months of recent work under your belt the gap becomes way less of an issue.\n\nYour technical skills are still there, just need some polish. The mental health journey you went through actually shows resilience even if it doesn't feel like it right now.",

Progress has been made, like Waymo‚Äôs driverless taxis, has been made. But, it has much slower and the edge cases have much harder to solve than anticipated.

I think that gaining experience is what's important, even if there's not a clear promotion path, because you can always go somewhere else with that experience and not jump through silly hoops for some promotion game. \n\nHere's another take on the promotion issue: I was on a small team that had a few senior and a few principal level devs. I wasn't quite at principal level and wasn't really thinking about promotion and I don't think many were also because there's just those two levels. I was at a FAANG before this and I actually kindof liked this mindset better because at FAANG we would work on stupid stuff sometimes until later you realize you were a tool for someone else's promotion project. However, at the smaller company to motivate people they still gave \"spot raises\"; if you did good work you were rewarded. I liked that process more because people were actually invested in just doing good work and not \"putting on a show\" of good work. \n\nTldr: do what the other comment said; stay but still look",

Not like a coffee chat with someone, but like you've delivered value to them somehow already and they're willing to take a gamble on you. To get my first job out of a boot camp I took a gig stocking shelves in a warehouse at a tech company, networked my ass off for a year internally, and got hired into the next junior role they had.\n\n\n2. Build useful things. Not a movie rating app, build something that you could charge money for. In fact, if you can actually monetize it, that's the best case scenario. Ideally, you'd build something that confronts some of the more challenging problems in web design. An app that solves caching problems with real time interactivity across users is cool and shows something, but your movie rating app won't count for hardly anything.\n\n3. Don't go remote. Anyone in the world can compete for a remote job, so it's orders of magnitude harder to stand out. Apply for in-office jobs with local companies who can meet you face to face. It filters out the competition and let's you make the process a little less sterile.\n\n\nHonestly, if you're 100% self taught, you need a bangin project. Even with boot camp programs you get some kind of \"OK, they know *something*\" assurance. If you're self-taught using online resources (which is what I would consider Udemy) you're going to need to be able to show some good work.\n\n\nThe good news is that if you *can* show good work, I think a self-taught dev that can build is always going to be viewed more favorably than a boot camp dev who can build, just because self-taught takes some grit.",
