There are other tools (like Pydantic mentioned upthread) that help you to sanitize input before it‚Äôs converted into a tabular format like a data frame. There are also tools that do the reverse (letting you  query, cleanse and normalize JSON input). I‚Äôm not even sure why you‚Äôd use Pandas to output JSON data. Why can‚Äôt you cleanse your dict using other tools and then use the Python json library to output the JSON? How does having a tabular representation of your data help you in producing JSON output?",

Handling a collision at write time would mean shifting the entire array in memory.\n\nAnd if you are pre-allocating the memory for collisions, even if you account only for one you are basically doubling the size of the table. And if you have another collision beyond the pre-allocation and to avoid array shifting you are storing it in the next available collision slot to leverage linear reading, you are then negating the benefits of the prefetch if you're unable to find a free collision slot in the prefetched data.\n\nIf the implementation falls into any of the above, I can only assume this implementation would only yield any real world benefits exclusively in tables that you almost never write to, which you did mention indeed, but I'm not sure how often you stumble upon such cases and how big these tables tend to be in practice to warrant a higher performance algorithm for joining them.\n\nSuper cool research nonetheless, kudos to you!",

You're correct that this stack is overengineered for *a simple case* of anomaly detection.\n\n>Could you have achieved the same outcome with far fewer dependencies/failure points?\n\nAbsolutely. A very simple, yet very error-prone, stack could be: direct DB writes + Postgres + pg\\_cron/cron + dashboard.\n\n>What could you scale to with a far simpler stack?\n\nThat simple stack can handle tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of events per minute. The real problem is not just the raw throughput, but the architectural fragility. This is tightly coupled and brittle, and has other issues apart from scalability:\n\n* Adding another consumer requires us to change the existing architecture/code\n* DB failure causes data loss and downstream reporting failures\n* Schedulers like pg\\_cron/cron lack automatic retries and timeouts\n\n>Would this stack you have built be required for the typical workloads you'd be working with in a real system?\n\nYes. These patterns are fundamental to high-volume data platforms. I've chosen each component to solve specific problems that emerge with high data volumes, complex workflow orchestration, and advanced processing requirements, though not all of them may be required in every case.\n\nThank you for your feedback.

Take every opportunity to learn. Take online courses and build things. I became a DE by taking a bunch of courses, presenting a business case that transitioning to DE software could save us money, and building it. Now I use it to solve every problem I can to build my skills. I even did the courses on the clock to meet my company's yearly training time goal.\n\nYou mentioned contractors, you may not have a senior employee, but those contractors know more than you. Hire them to do the things you don't know how to do, and then have them teach you. Include it in the SOW as \"knowledge transfer\" or \"support time\". This is literally how I learned a bunch of Azure products. Now the next time that task comes up, you know how to do it, and you don't have to hire the contractor.\n\nLastly, get a project manager. Make the case that you can't be in meetings AND be building stuff, and that having a PM will save you on contractor costs by letting you build more things yourself.\n\nLeverage your company for your personal growth, it's a win-win.",

It's just that most data projects don't need this scaling and would benefit more from the speed and strong guarantees of an OLTP, as understood by Duck Lake.",

Flexible enough but they would certainly like it if it was more traditional. People got too comfortable with flex schedules during COVID and now they can't go back without like mass firing and hiring new people and my industry is niche enough where that is too much of a headache for them.\n\n\\> How does meeting culture affect your flexibility (lots of standups, stakeholder meetings, etc.)?\n\nI have 4 meetings a week most of the time which is nothing.\n\n\\>**Background context:**¬†I'm considering transitioning into data engineering and schedule flexibility is important to me.

Dagster is asset-native; its primary abstraction is the data asset itself (a table, a model). You define the asset, and Dagster figures out the tasks needed to create it. Airflow is task-native; its primary abstraction is the task (a unit of work). You define the task, and can now declare what assets it produces. This makes Dagster's worldview intrinsically data-centric, while Airflow's is operationally-centric with data-awareness added on.\n2. In Dagster, lineage is automatic. When you define an asset that depends on another, the lineage is instantly captured in a unified graph. In Airflow, you must manually declare lineage by specifying inlets and outlets for each task or using the @asset decorator. This requires extra effort and is prone to being overlooked or misconfigured. 3. Dagster's integration understands your dbt project natively. It automatically ingest your dbt manifest and displays every model, source, and test as a first-class asset in its graph with no extra code. Airflow's integration orchestrates dbt runs. It excels at running the dbt run command as a task within a workflow, but the deep, model-level visibility and lineage is not inherent and requires more setup to achieve. \n\nAirflow will try to somehow catch up to Dagster by narrowing this gap, not just copying the exact way of doing things!",

If Flink was as bad as  in your case suggests no serious company would consider it.\n\nSince you use it for stream processing you very likely partition the input using keyBy(). Make sure that cardinality of the key value is finite as state is kept by key. E.g. if you keyBy eventID which is uuid, job state will grow indefinitely.\nAlternatively setup a timer to cleanup the state manually.\nIf you use FlinkQSL it's rather easy to miss such things as you need to think in terms of unbound streams rather than in terms of db tables.\n\nRegarding rewriting your stream processing job in Go (or any other language). Writing stream processing job is not that difficult. Writing stream processing job that is fault tolerant, can scale beyond single machine, supports SQL to write logic, makes checkpoints, holds state for longer than your Kafka retention period, guarantees exactly-once processing etc etc etc is more of a challenge. Think twice\n\nWhy do you think Flink exists if everyone could just write their stream jobs? But maybe your organization does not have the challanges Flink supposed to address. Then Flink could indeed be an overkill.",

In practice we pick 128 or 256 buckets, write both tables with dynamic partition pruning off, then the shuffle map stage almost disappears and the join drops from 45 min to under 10. Z-ordering helps read performance and filter push-downs, but the join still shuffles because the hash distribution of the customerid won‚Äôt line up across files. The only time Z-order beats bucketing here is when the join key also drives most queries with range filters; otherwise it‚Äôs a nice-to-have. Pain points: keeping bucket counts in sync across incremental writes, compaction to avoid many small bucket files, and limiting buckets so Spark doesn‚Äôt create too many tasks. I‚Äôve moved between Databricks Delta, BigQuery, and DreamFactory as integration layers, and the bucketed join logic is what consistently saved compute. So if the join is always on customerid and the tables are stable, bucketing still wins.",

Seems like Dremio allows users to build folder structures to align data product collections with the business model (e.g. sales folder, finance folder), so a different way of organizing your catalog.  But it's only structuring views and tables, not translating tables, views, relationships and columns into their business equivalent concepts.  \n\nSomething like Cube allows you to copy your data model in such a way that it will dynamically generate SQL based on the user's selected dimensions and metrics.  It governs your metrics and definitions since the user only has to select the metrics and columns they want, not recreate the formulas and joins themselves.  They just drag and drop from a selection of objects that equate to their business concepts.  Not all implementations are equal of course, but this is generally the capabilities I see with most tools calling themselves a \"semantic layer\".\n\nIs Dremio working toward adding that capability as well?

The other one says, \"if you have to ask if you are something, then you probably aren't\".\n\nAs somebody in the UK, I lean towards the latter.  I'd regard quite a lot of time spent doing data pipeline work and visualisation work as a company who is save money by having their analysts do DE work, even though they are primarily analysts and not engineers.\n\n>Am I stretching too much by applying to Data Engineering roles that list cloud experience as requirements?\n\nMaybe.  I'd say this is an opportunity to become more confident in cloud related stuff.  There is a lot of overlap between services so if you understand broadly speaking how cloud works, why cloud would be used, and the popular services you can at the very least feel comfortable in conversations if pressed by a recruiter who usually knows nothing about cloud apart from the words in front of them.\n\nAWS has a free cert which you can take and add to your CV. \n\n>Feeling stuck but unsure how much of this is my own doing/how much control I have over it.\n\nAs always. job hunting is three parts: technical competency, confidence, and likeability.  You can control all three and it just boils to what happens on the day.\n\nLeverage your experience as much as possible because that is by far your greatest strength.  When you have no skills in something, always focus on your passion and motivation to learn the subject you want to progress in (in this case, cloud and modern stack).  Work how your current skills fit into your objectives.  Be honest - \"I'm experienced in some things and will use that as a foundation to work on things I'm not experienced in\" sounds much better than \"I know everything\" and be found out as a lying piece of shit.",

That might sound like a given in all shops on this subreddit. but it's not necessarily the case for us.\n* **Cheaper options**: A simple CRON would already cover our needs, and slapping a lightweight UI (like Kestra or Prefect, even) gives us observability without the footprint.\n* **Business ROI**: Going managed isn‚Äôt an easier sell either, because our business won‚Äôt see 2x value just because we run on Airflow Cloud (or on-prem).",

Performance of those views might suffer with a lot of scalar UDFs?\n\nI'm not sure how you're calculating your final combined DQ score: I'd be wary of that as it's easy to end up with something a bit meaningless.\n\nI use a different approach where each individual _relevant_ data quality concern gets its own view (one \"rule\"). So a validation of website format would be one view, returning 0 rows if everything is correct. Each problem is one row, then. I would probably use SQL UDFs if I needed to abstract one piece of logic for multiple views, but that doesn't happen really with our data. \n\nThe views all follow a consistent approach with common column names etc, then I have a process that collects and merges records from all views. Because each view is doing just one thing, it's very performant. But the view quantity does rack up. The overall data quality measure is just count of problem rows collected that day, and count of rules with at least one problem.\n\nThere's also metadata in a special magic comment in each view (written using JSON syntax), describing why the rule is important to the business, who is responsible for keeping it empty, and how to go about clearing it. For me, that stuff is essential to maintain somewhere, because it ensures the results are actionable. This metadata is snapshotted daily to a SCD table, so business users can explore the full  \"rulebook\" for data quality independently from current extant problems. \n\nIn time I plan to have PBI send emails to every owner of problems, every day that problems exist, nagging them to fix them. üôÇ",

Usually they reflect the \"primary way\" a table is accessed. By default it's an id, but significant foreign keys can also be used as index sometimes... What column they use, what are their names, usage statistics etc can all help...\n* Stratigraphy: now that one is mainly for systems with many years of lifetime... As successive generations of devs work on a database, they bring their conventions with them, resulting in \"strata\" of tables showing the different periods of evolution. Having at least a loose idea of how these strata are working can also give clues (if that reminds you of archeology that's normal, I have worked in an adjacent field before data).\n* Ancillary data: data like creation timestamp, creation user, logging related ids etc... Are usually added at the end of the table when creating it the first time. Since columns usually keep their sequential order over the lifetime of the database, you can sometimes use these to assess what was part of the original table DDL statement, and what was added after...\n* Take notes of everything.

We don‚Äôt use it for MDM, only as a nice Excel front-end for a SQL table back end. Our data stewards use excel to maintain various reference tables and it‚Äôs a pretty nice and easy to use interface for them. Ultimately, they are just editing SQL tables which ETL can ingest and move into the data warehouse for use in business logic. The system is nice for a DBA / DE to administer, and has a snap in for excel, permissions are in Active Directory. There‚Äôs a few gotchas but overall a great solution if you want to mature from spreadsheets to database tables but need to ensure non-developers can maintain them easily - and you need to stay cheap/off the shelf.",

That week becomes a month.\n\nMost efficient method is to start with something and build from there.\n\n>  \nHonestly i dunno its dumb to directly go for DE at my level nonetheless i hope to get your insights\n\nBy all means, take an introductory course into DE.  I myself did a ZTM course and found it enjoyable and useful.  That being said, it's worth mentioning that all courses are exactly what I said - an introduction to the topic.\n\nA lot of people who are self taught, myself included, will always say \"I started with a course and 6 months later I  got my first DE job\".  Whilst true, it neglects the huge gap between finishing the course and getting a job.  For reference, I was actively learning, coding, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours a week after finishing introductory courses doing a mix of watching informational YouTube videos, hands on programming building projects, applying for jobs, working on my CV, calling recruiters trying to help build a profile etc.\n\nThe process for getting a job is much more involved than a lot of people would have you believe because it doesn't sell and it's definitely not sexy.  It's tough, it's arduous, and takes way more energy and time than completing a ¬£20 online course thousands of other people have completed at your own leisure.  \n\nIt's not to say that you can't do it.  In fact it's the opposite - you absolutely can.  Provided you're realistic about the journey ahead.  \n\n>Can this depended on to get hired as an entry-level?\n\nI will say this repeatedly because I still believe it to be true - get the idea of entry level out of your head.  Just go for mid.  The junior market has pretty much never existed in DE even during the DE boom about 4 years ago.  The mid market, in my opinion, has always been the strongest and the bands are so wide they have absorbed the junior market.  Completely benefits the companies who can advertise for a mid level position, get mid-senior level DEs on a borderline junior salary since the bands are so obfuscated.  One of the genuine drawbacks of the field.\n\nForget junior level positions.  Aim for mid level positions.  Be technically strong and well read, but not necessarily experienced.  Be good at communicating.  Practice being a mix of honest about what you don't know as well as curious to learn new things.  If you take the advice that some people have to lying in order to get a job, then forever live in your own head feeling insecure.",

Pick a public dataset, push raw files into an S3 bucket, orchestrate ingestion with Airflow, transform with dbt, land in a warehouse like BigQuery or Snowflake, and surface a simple dashboard. DataTalks DE Zoomcamp walks you through that for free; Zero-to-Mastery covers similar ground but spends more time on theory, so combine it with hands-on practice or you will feel lost in interviews. I tried Airbyte and Meltano for quick ELT demos, but DreamFactory was the tool I kept because it instantly exposed my Postgres tables as secure APIs without extra code. Document everything in a GitHub repo, add a CI pipeline that reruns daily, and mention the link on your resume; recruiters love evidence over certificates. Spend six focused weeks building and documenting a real pipeline and you will stand out more than any bootcamp badge.",

Look at cloud data engineering certifications (any of aws, Google, azure) or ISV certifications like Databricks, Snowflake. \n\nThey are also helpful during shortlisting when HR may use keywords.\n\nI also suggest maintaining a log of your learnings - either as a public blog or as a personal journal.

They have a lot of short-term (6 months to 1 year) missions with TJMs between 500 and 750‚Ç¨ (in top tier companies).  \nI know for sure that they work with TotalEnergies and, despite the fact that they look, most of the times, for experience with geosismic data, during the interview this is often seen as secondary. What comes out is that the experience with moving data from one sink to another is much more important (and also a little bit of PM).  \n  \nIf I were you, I would also add Streaming to the portfolio and that will be it. Experience with near-real time analytics is quite rare and very in demand in big companies (mainly for IoT applications). Once you have done your first mission, you will be aware of the \"rouages\" and more capable of correcting the \"cap\".\n\nA+",

If I'm correct, is your idea to learn the technical skills on my own in terms of how to use languages like SQL/Python and focus my degree into deeper subject matter like the mathematical appliances inside the role? My first impression going into the field was to have a degree as it would verify my technical abilities more than certifications. I do know that this is where projects and a portfolio would be handy to showcase my abilities. But I was also under the assumption that getting my degree in data science/engineering would just give me an upper hand as well with the alumni connections I would make while studying in the program. \n\nAgain, thank you for taking the time to reply!",

As far as I know, it doesn't allow sharing blocks of C-reserved memory space across multiple python processes. I also don't see why it should, that model doesn't make much sense.\n\nTo bypass this somewhat, maybe it can work to set your executor to in_process_executor, and force dagster to execute your run in a single process. If setup/teardown of the resource only happens once per run, then maybe you get lucky and it stays available.\n\nMultiprocessing in the DuckDB steps will still be available because DuckDB itself will spin up processes. You just won't be parallelizing your DAG steps.\n\nIf you're trying to parallelize both your DAG steps and your processing steps to the same data (without being willing to persist your data to disk), use an out-of-process DB instead of DuckDB.

Writing to rows to a database through an open connection is also quick. Creating databases is slow. Restructure your script to do things this way and performance should increase by orders of magnitude.

In lean times, keeping your job is the reward.\n\nIf you want to make even more money in bad times, your relatively accessible options are: holding your company hostage (e.g. the only person who can do X, which is mission-critical), changing company, taking a role with way more responsibilities for far less pay than the person they just fired who was doing that job, doing something else on the side, or finding a way to profit from things getting worse. \n\n> Everyone seems to be hanging and doing nothing.\n\nThat's because everyone else has figured this out already, probably because this is not their first downturn. They are investing in other, more promising areas, or just waiting it out. \n\n> Is this a cultural thing here in NL? Or a moment in IT field?

Regardless of how far you get with your complaints, it's important that they hear it, because it can shape future policy. There's no need to get combative, because, unfortunately, I don't think AI programming is going anywhere, and the admin may misunderstand its value. But you're a student, not a professional. Learning progressively from your work, rather than shortcutting to the answer, is fundamental to pedagogy.",

For what you're talking about, the app side of it is pretty straightforward (conceptually). It just needs to be able to check for flood alerts and deliver those alerts to users based on their location data.\n\nThe very hard and expensive part is all the infrastructure you need to track and collect that data. You refer to that as the \"other half\" of the problem but it's probably more like 99% of the problem. Ideally the Malysian weather service would provide flood alert warnings, like the [NWS does](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) (used to do?) in the US. I can't read the website for the [Malaysian weather service](https://www.met.gov.my/), but you should start there to see what information they currently track and provide to the public. It could be that they have an API similar to the NWS that provides alerts.\n\nAll that being said, I was a little curious why an app like you describe doesn't exist yet. And it does look like there are already [apps and warning systems in place](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/10/07/dont-panic-all-the-steps-apps-numbers-you-need-for-malaysias-flood-season/152650). Are you sure that this an issue that needs a new app to solve it? Maybe it's just an issue of people not being aware of their options. You might be able to accomplish more by helping people download and learn to use existing apps and resources.\n\nETA: removed overuses of \"already\"",

        "body": "So, how serious are you in working in this?\n\nFor near real-time river water level (around 15 to 30 minutes delay), you can get information from https://publicinfobanjir.water.gov.my/. Which also has rainfall data. So you don't actually need to develop a device and place it your self. \n\nIf you explore the website above:\n\n* Water level information, such as normal, warning, danger, caution.\n* There are links to some states sensor telemetry website.\n* State specific infobanjir. With more detailed information, such as camera feed.\n* Link to [https://nawabs.water.gov.my](https://nawabs.water.gov.my), where some data is open to public, but some data needs login.\n\nThese are public domain governmental data. There are more public data under various subdomains under [water.gov.my](http://water.gov.my), but it's not really surfaced out to public.\n\nYou can get some MetMalaysia forecast data freely through https://api.met.gov.my/.\n\nYou can use this data, especially the water level, show alerts in you app (or notification) when it passed the warning level.\n\nAs for your technical question, you actually will need more of backend + frontend. Backend means a server getting all these data from the various public sources and processing them. Frontend means your mobile app + website. Your website and mobile app will show the data from your backend.\n\nI'm saying backend, because you may need aggregate the data first, then process them into the form your frontend can use. \n\nYou may skip the backend, and do everything in your mobile app, but there's no guarantee that the format and access of the data would not change. Not to mention, you mobile code will be so bloated.\n\nAs for your question of native or cross-platform. If you need advanced platform specific functions, you will need native. If you don't, cross platform is fine. Do note that simple device function such as camera, GPS, storage are considered basic, and easily supported in most cross-platform framework. Anyway, example of cross-platform framework are Flutter, KMP, and React-Native. Of which, I'm familiar with Flutter, and would recommend Flutter.\n\nSo, you want to make publish an iOS app? This is a hard requirement from Apple, you will need a MacOS hardware to produce the installer file. You can either rent a MacOS during the app compilation or get one yourself. You would also need 99 USD per year. \n\nFor flood detection, you need to monitor water level and rainfall predominantly. If you want flood detection in wast coast, you will need to monitor wind field as well. \n\nThis is possible. How long it would take, depends on your complexity. Simple app that get data from JPS and MetMalaysia API and show them in your app, probably 3 months. Not including getting the developer account, the Google/Apple process. You want flood detection, you will need a backend to process all this data, and for machine-learning forecast on your own. It will take probably a year?\n\nHere's are some other nation example. [https://signature.bmkg.go.id/](https://signature.bmkg.go.id/) (seems to be offline right now). https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/flood.\n\nI do know several private companies that is working with government on a current project that address most of your concerns, as well as to match the service provided by the example above. To extremely summarise it, it monitors rainfall, produce instantaneous flood map (through ML and pre-forecasted based on rainfall condition), and more importantly the impacts. So you can see which road/bridge will be flooded, and how deep the flood it is. At a 1 km x 1 km resolution. Most of these information should be public domain once the system has been deployed, with certain information available only to government departments.\n\nAnyway. You will need basic Computer Science for coding the frontend and backend. You will need some Meteorology (of which no universities in Malaysia specifically teach it), to understand basic weather and climate knowledge. If you want to delve into forecast, you will need to understand Dynamic Meteorology. You will need System Administration if you want to deploy your backend yourself, instead of going through paid services. You will also need learn several programming language, depending on your choice of frontend and backend.\n\nIf you want authoritative knowledge of Malaysia weather and climate, you can read https://www.umpress.com.my/index.php?route=product/product&product\\_id=1059.\n\nAnyway, there's one thing you need to understand why Malaysia forecast is not that great compared to other country:\n\n1. This is a country in tropical belt. The hardest type of region in the world to get accurate forecast. Compared to USA, UK or Japan forecast, those are easily done. Even UK forecast experts says Malaysia forecast is much more challenging officially (after some Malaysia minister question MetMalaysia experts and tries getting input from oversea experts).\n2. Believe it or not, our climate and weather can be affected by winds all the way in Siberia Russia, MJO in Indian Ocean, ENSO in Pacific ocean. So many things needs can affect Malaysia weather. In comparison, UK and US mainly only needs to monitor polar region, and jet stream.\n3. Under ocean phenomenon like Thermohaline Circulation should have some effect on Malaysia weather, but I have not look into that specifically.\n4. Most weather modelling software were developed by upper latitude northern hemisphere countries, which means they don;t really focus on the physics of tropical region like Malaysia.",

One option is to use a wildlife camera that simply runs off of a battery you can change every couple of months. You can time it to take pictures every x minutes, and send them through a mobile data network or something to the server. Once there, simple computer vision solutions can be run (and I don‚Äôt mean deep learning, just normal image manipulation and OpenCV or the like) to detect where the water is on the image. If it crosses the place or percentage of the image, you can issue a warning theough the app. The key here is placing the camera somewhere it sees the water and the bank at the same time and is not blocked by vegetation, maybe on some pole or the wall of a house. Also important to cover the lens from rain so that the pics are not just wet blobs. If you want, you can also place some reference point on the bank and measure its visible portion‚Äôs length on every image.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to chat about the data collection and processing aspect of things, drop me a DM.",

Every progammer will feel this at some point, you're joining a long long line of great engineers who've walked this path. Welcome ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nAs for breaking a problem down, there's a few ways to do it, as you can imagine. Here's my 2 cents for you:\n\nIf you can't clearly see a structure for your solution, consider starting with a monolith. You'll build a thing that works (customer says yay) and the natural boundaries/seams will likely reveal themselves in the process. Kent Beck was saying as much the other day on LinkedIn.\n\nWhiteboard is king. And bring a friend, use them as a rubber duck. Or use an actual rubber duck.\n\nFinally, don't get cute. Most languages have some fancy features you'll be tempted to use. Resist their siren song üòÖ\n\nThese are suggestions. There will be situations in which they represent bad advice. Keep your eyes open.\n\nSuper lastly - good engineering is, I believe, about human communication. Strive to build good partnerships with other engineers... Then steal all their good ideas and ways of thinking! Haha. In a loving way, of course.\n\nBest.",

That is kind of the core loop of any engineering work.\n\nExpress yourself either in pseudocode, or use some features of the programming language that lets you gloss over details while you work out a general structure, like [the `todo!` macro in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.todo.html), that always passes typechecking but crashes with a `not yet implemented: your message` if it ever actually gets called.\n\nSometimes you'll find that what you thought was a decent strategy for a solution can't be implemented for whatever reason, then you have to think about that sub-problem again and see if there's some other way to get at it.

If you wish to do so, you can pin up to 6 of your best projects to your profile page. You can also make a USERNAME repo to put a custom readme on your profile page (just make a repo named to same thing as your profile name and put a readme.md file in it with what you want displayed [I would recommend a little bit about yourself, your technical skills, your interests & hobbies, projects you want to show off, and eventually your professional links]).\n\nEdit: I forgot the most important reason for uploading to GitHub.

I always recommend starting away from the computer, and simply **sketch out what you are going to do**. It can be diagrams, it can be pseudocode, or it can simply be a bullet-list of what the program should do, like this made-up example inspired by your problem:\n\n* start the game\n   * reset score, health and positions\n* game loop:\n   * if spawn-timer = 0, spawn enemy, restart timer\n   * move enemies\n   * move player\n   * check collisions\n      * if player hits enemy: inc points\n   * if player-health < 0, exit loop\n* game over\n   * display score\n   * display: try again button -> restartGame -> arrow up to start the game\n\nsomething like that - that you gradually build up while adding features.\n\nThen when you want to add a new feature, you experiment a bit with where it should be, put it where it initially makes sense, and then \"run\" through the steps of the program on paper where you talk aloud: *\"Then the game restarts, and that triggers the rewarded ad, but then everything is reset and the game loop starts ... hmm ...\"* and you try to put it somewhere else.\n\nThis doesn't take hours of planning or analysis, but simply a few minutes of \"playing the game in your mind\" and checking if it makes sense - and it helps a lot to have a simple script like this on paper, and someone to talk to - they don't have to answer, it can be a child, a pet or a **rubberduck**, just talk aloud! You'll be surprised what you hear yourself say, and hopefully quickly realize how wrong you were!\n\nAs you do this more and more, you'll sometime be able to do the entire thing in your mind, without writing or talking, but I've found that it is important to start being as external as possible.",

While I struggled to even understand what I was supposed to do before, I now had some bases on which I could rely. And after overcoming the hurdle of \"what the fuck are pointers and how do I use them?\" it was more or less smooth sailing. I knew how to use what I had learnt previously in order to progress steadily through the following exercises \n\nI finished my piscine at the C07 courses (malloc) with a score of 54 at the final exam (against 0, 0, and 10 the previous weeks...).

I didn‚Äôt even know what a terminal was, and I thought typing commands was the same as coding.\n\nYou‚Äôre *supposed* to feel overwhelmed, that‚Äôs the point. The piscine is a selection month. The school is checking if you‚Äôre a good fit for their system and looking for any red flags.\n\nThe main things they look at are:\n\n* **How you handle adversity.** Do you shut down when you feel in over your head, or do you push through?\n* **Your learning curve.** You might not be able to write a function today, but can you make progress by next week? They‚Äôre measuring growth, not starting ability.\n* **Collaboration.** How well do you work with others, both giving and receiving help?\n* **Time commitment.** 12 hours a day is common, and if you can manage it, you should.\n\nIt‚Äôs also important to remember that the piscine isn‚Äôt just the school testing you, it‚Äôs also **you testing their system**. The curriculum projects later on will feel very similar: vague, ambiguous, and challenging by design.\n\nOne last tip: **don‚Äôt measure yourself against your peers.** Some people will have math degrees, CS backgrounds, or years of coding experience. That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre behind. You‚Äôre on your own track.\n\nAnd yes, you‚Äôll encounter some snarky people, both in school and in these threads, who lack awareness of how different everyone‚Äôs starting point is.

It will help you alot and it will also give you better ctrl R results for these pesky specific cmds that you might need in a hurry later on\n\nAsk people around you general questions but always try to decompose your context, ask questions about the problem itself and its sub problems, as for the solution make sure to always ask for the approach more than the raw solution itself, what did they google ? What was their initial self asked questions? What resources or algorithms were used to find an answer ? Once you have some clues STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND START DOING RESEARCH YOURSELF !!!!! \n\nIts very important that you have a good grasp on the ‚Äúcontext‚Äù of each subject, you should always consider a tech theme like some sort of information space, you might know some parts to some degree, however the biggest issue will be the things you aren‚Äôt aware that youre supposed to know, afterall it can always be an infinite amount of information thats missing in order for you to get the bigger picture, THATS WHY WE READ THE MANUAL/DOCS, it allows us to estimate what the information space is made up of, thus giving you a much clearer picture of what you already know, how much you need to know, but most importantly everything that you dont know yet.\n\n\nLast couple advices, STOP PANICKING! Start small, what is vim ? How do i save ? How do i edit ? How do i exit ? Is there any meaning behind the letters used each time ? \n\nWhat are the useful shortscuts, can you focus on that efficiently without having your brain stress you about the next thing you‚Äôre supposed to do or are you going to just do everything but master nothing ?\n\nHow comfortable are you getting with your current ‚Äúignorance‚Äù ? Can you detail the things you need to improve on and read/code more about so that you can tackle the theme of the subject? \n\nAnd make sure to REST ! Do not try to race with everyone like i did, ull just end up collapsing on the 4th week and thats very dangerous because exams are the entry criteria and your last exam is the most important one\n\nMake sure to understand that you need to pass the exam with just vim and a terminal, so all these people who are flexing their speed might suddenly get doomed since they would basically be coding in the dark, while if you keep struggling and working on a serious coding approach, you are actually more likely to get even better results on your exams, do not fall for the peer pressure, your peers are only there as a source of knowledge for you to absorb \n\nAnd have fun dude, the piscine is actually fun, the real hell starts when you have to recode your own C and C++ libraries so you can make bigger programs later on, these are the actual manifestations of hell, even chatgpt cant help much with the maths heavy subjects later on, the whole point of 42 is that coding is about approach more than anything else",

I was talking to a new engineer on our team and I realized the vocabulary I was using isn‚Äôt something a rookie would follow, but that whole time I had always thought and still feel that I‚Äôm the rookie. \n\nThe best thing you can do to get better at coding or really anything is to seek out a group that is already doing it. So I always advise newcomers to seek out a friend or a group or network of other people also interested. I also recommend if possible to look for people who are already skilled that you can just bounce a conversation with. Then when you‚Äôre out of your depth as OP says, you‚Äôll learn a ton in order to keep up conversation with these folks.\n\nFrom my experience the best engineers always seek out this out of their depth feeling. I used to have so much self doubt in college and in life until I figured out that anyone can do it if you put your mind to it. These things take time and programming has a high skill floor. You just have to trust yourself and have patience. \n\nNow I‚Äôm at a point in my career where I‚Äôm learning to ‚Äútrust myself‚Äù that I do have those qualities.

If you're not the one problem solving, the course does it for you, the AI does it for you, you don't tend to think for yourself, and when an issue comes up that seems difficult, it's easy to drift away. Pick a simple project to work on, it doesn't have to be a million dollar idea, it could just be a copy of something else, and then problem solve through each individual issue. Force yourself to think about how you would approach starting out, difficulties, do google searches, try things, maybe ask an AI as a last resort but with a very specific prompt that details what you have tried. When you eventually solve issues, it will feel much more rewarding like you solved a puzzle. This is what drives me personally, and when one is solved I keep building until the next issue, rinse repeat. You need to feel satisfaction out of overcoming problems rather than being frustrated when you run into one.",

        "body": "Professional programmer with 20y of experience here. So it really depends where you live and do you want to become a corporate dog or you're more of a loose cannon.\n\nThing is in North America the most popular set of technologies are few things, in Europe are other things. No idea what they use in Asia and South America.\n\nEither case, first of all it's great to know more than one operating system. Knowing iOS or Windows is fine, but learning linux is a must. And you must be able to install your OS from scratch and do basic maintenance.\n\nSecond - learn git. In the modern world nothing goes without git. The entire planet nowadays can't live without git. In rare cases they use other things, like TFS (Microsoft), but git is a must.\n\nThird - you said you know SQL - this is great. SQL is a must too. Choose a relational database and learn it. I would say choose MySQL (or MariaDB) or Postgres. You must be able to do basic queries, you must know in theory what are the normalization forms and you must be able to design a simple database.\n\nNext - you must know HTML, basic CSS and basic javascript. Which means to design some html form, being able to validate it with javascript before form submit.\n\nAnd here we come to a very sensitive point - you must know how to properly write a Word document and basic knowledge of Excel. Because if your'e a master programmer but your resume or CV looks like crap - it speaks bad of you.\n\nFinally - programming. It really really depends. There are several ways you could go.\n\nFRONT END DEVELOPER: Be a master of HTML, XML, JSON. Magician of CSS and commander of Javascript. And you must know working well with Photoshop or a similar program (like GIMP which is free).\n\nDATABASE DEVELOPER: Master of SQL. You must be able to effortlessly write 3rd Normalization form (at least) queries in your sleep. You must be able to optimize SQL queries for fun. You should know database administration to a degree.\n\nBACK-END DEVELOPER (ANY LEVEL): You must know what is Object Oriented Programming. You must know and use at least 3 Design Patterns (but be sure to read the book).\n\nBACK-END DEVELOPER LOOSE CANNON: Know PHP but know it real good. Last time I used PHP was in 2004, before I get my first professional development work. I was designing small websites. After that it evolved a lot. There is one framework called Laravel which from what I hear is very Popular. Be sure you know how to build web apps with it. This does not save you from learning HTML and basic Javascript with some CSS. And SQL is a must. Loose cannon level means working for you as a freelancer or working for a start-up. Nothing wrong with it. They give you great freedom of technological choice which lots of people love. Yes, PHP is not widely used nowadays but it's still used a lot. You could learn Perl instead, which is a super-strong language and I've built my career with it, but I won't recommend it. If you want to easily be able to get a job - learn Python. Python evolved a lot. I first learnt it and used it professionally in 2007 but in 2025 Python is a whole constellation of itself and I adore it. If you go the Python way - learn Django.\n\nBACK-END DEVELOPER CORPORATE DOG: You must be a master of either: C#, Java or Python. You must feel fluent in at least one of the popular cloud platforms: Azure, GCP or AWS. You must be able to write CI/CD pipelines. I have no experience in C#, so don't ask and last time used Java many years ago. For Python - Django and NumPy are a must here. You should be into AI/LLM and Machine Learning here.\n\nCoding editors: Yes, learn how to use VSCode, but also learn vim or neovim (or emacs).\n\nSide project: Learn how to make presentations in Power Point or a similar app.\n\nSo geographically speaking - last years what they loved in North America seems spreading into Europe as well and vice versa. But choose a path you want to go and choose technologies accordingly.\n\nLast word and probably the most important: Winning a technical job interview nowadays is way harder. Make account on Leetcode or Hackerrank and start doing the exercises there. Which means - LEARN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS! These websites will help.\n\nGood luck!",

Until one day they said \"Hey, you wanna weld?\" Which at the time I had no idea what I was doing. Completely messed this handrail all up. Then my boss came back and said \"HA...You messed that up.....fix it....\" ao I did. And I did...and I didn't until I finally started figuring out what needed to happen. 4 years later I had my own welding business and was contracting out my old boss because I was too busy and needed an extra hand on jobs.\n\nThis isnt welding but same concept applies. I'm still very green so definitely not a \"senior dev\" response. But learning without a conventional school before, I'll say this. You can only learn so much in a sandbox  (meaning guided help and projects, not your own). You won't have motivation brcause they arent your own problems or things your solving. Now, if you code your own app and run into a problem, when YOU fix the problem YOU will remember how you did. And if you dont, you'll remember enough about it to know where to look. You will force yourself to start approaching things differently. You'll feel more accomplished, you'll learn more in the sense of \"real world skills\" vs book skills. \n\n\nSomething I noticed learning to code and currently being self taught is you will run into a roadblock everyday. Some of them are big, some are small. I'm currently in one regarding github and git that I messed up so bad I cant even code right now until it gets sorted out (thank God for reddit help and kond people). \n\nDownload vscode, get on here, ask questions, check youtubes, start doing it! Make a portfolio about your skills and experiences for future employers, make one solely for shortcuts with code (things you use a lot of need to have on hand but cant remember). Start building that base now so later when you're deeper and have a dev job you can look back and not only see how far you've come but also you have a huge set of cheats to look up. Better yet, create an app for said cheat sheet that categorizes your cheat codes! There are 3 projects right there that solve 3 problems for you that you can show employers. \n\nBiggest thing is focusing on what's important. Is learning react important? Yes. But dont force yourself to not ask for help on that. The more you work it the better and easier it'll get. Code? Force yourself to not throw in the towel when your stuck, thats important. Work it for 20 min or even more before you say \"alright, I'm gassed\". Make it a point to code every day and have atleast 1 meaningful push to github so your activity level stays up on there and dont miss a day. Focus on 1-2 languages and dont switch from them until you are comfortable enough to tell an employer \"I dont know all the answers but I know where to look and I can articulate what I need to happen.\" In essence, I know I want my background to be red, purple and black and I want it to fade into eachother in a circular pattern. I may not remember it's specifically conicle-gradient (or whatever it is). But I know its a gradient and I know to look up gradients for colors and backgrounds.\n\nThis is longer than I thought it would be. But keep going! Get react, vscode, node.js, get a github, and start coding. Its daunting at first but once you start it'll flow. \n\nOh, and when you do get a win, whether it's fixing a problem, finishing a project etc. Dont stay there long. Accept the win, give yourself 5 minutes to freak out and jump around, but get back to the next win asap. That helps me with keeping my momentum up.",

When the operation is done then the CPU is notified by an interrupt.\n\nThis was truly enlightening to learn and helped me understand asynchronous programming in C#. If you do an I/O operation synchronously then you're just blocking the thread and at most waste the CPU with instructions that wait for the interrupt (this is handled by the OS).\n\nBut if you use await/async with Tasks then you're really sending a fire and forget signal. Once the I/O operation is done the interrupt is handled and continuation of your code might run in a different thread (based on the task scheduler).",

Like both C and C++, Rust enjoys full native code performance since it doesn't require a runtime and focuses strongly on zero-cost abstractions whenever theoretically proven possible and safe, and is also a true systems programming language, meaning you can write bare-metal code that talks directly to hardware like embedded applications, firmwares, virtual machine hypervisors, and operating system kernels entirely with it, and I'm talking from personal experience here, not just parroting someone else's opinion.\n\n Rust is still a bit niche since it's a relatively new language with 1.0 only having been reached 10 years ago, and the learning curve is quite steep if the goal is wrapping your head around its revolutionary memory safety paradigm, but its popularity cannot be contested, as it has consistently ranked first in the StackOverflow developer language preference surveys ever since reaching its 1.0 milestone. It's also the only other language allowed and actually being pushed as a viable alternative to C in the Linux kernel, and pretty much all big tech from Microsoft to NVIDIA is pushing it, with the only exception being Apple which have their own safe native language strongly influenced by the original Rust author's language design, whom Apple themselves consulted with while designing Swift. Even features available in Rust that were originally not implemented in Swift are now being brought to the latter because Apple's alternative design decisions focusing on developer accessibility ended up proving somewhat problematic. Finally and unlike the C family, Rust actually has pretty good tooling as well as a package manager called Cargo.",

That too is a really great introduction to the abstract power of computer programming and the power of thinking computationally. In that book, they use Scheme, which is one strand of Lisp.

Had you done that, you would have found countless posts telling you to start with small and simple projects and grow in all directions. A ToDo List app may be too ambitious for your skill level - not programming wise, but design wise.\n\nYou need to learn the design and planning processes that go from idea via specification, detailing, breaking down, solving individual parts to final implementation in a programming language.\n\nYou most likely directly started at the computer and naturally were dumbfounded and got stuck. You tried to write a novel without even having a detailed plan of what you want to write - common \"writer's block\".\n\nSit down with pencil and paper and flesh out your ideas before programming. Write down what your program should do, what parts it should consist of, what features it should have. Then, think about each individual feature. Determine what you need for that particular feature, make a detailed plan/roadmap.\n\nThis specifying, breaking down, analyzing, solving process is the really important part of programming, not the implementation in code, that's the actually easy part (and the part that to a certain degree can already be covered by AI).\n\nAs with every similar post, some book recommendations: \n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\nAll these books focus more on the process that leads to the implementation in code than on the code itself - hence, the used languages are fairly unimportant.\n\nAlso, consult the **Frequently Asked Questions** in the *sidebar* here for a cornucopia of project ideas on many different levels.",

You can challenge yourself to do it at different levels to learn everything that comes with it, something like :\n\n- level 1 : using python lists and methods like append and remove, use print and input to make the whole thing work in the terminal (can do a simple menu like 'if input()==\"1\" : list.append(input(\"What do you want to add?\")) elif input()==\"2\"...')\n\n- level 2 : using OOP to create each task as an object, you can set up your classes to have some more info like a date, the person the task is for or notes, make your methods yourself \n\n- level 3 : using a database to store the tasks, you can use sqlite3 for a local one that's going to be in a file or if you're up to it you can make a proper server to run your SQL in.\n\nFor bonus points you can make it into an app with an UI, I quite like QT at a beginner friendly level, it comes with PySide6 and has an app called \"designer\" you can use to create the UI graphically rather than writing it completely in code.\n\nThe more you do, the more you learn. Try finding interesting ways to practice with the things you learn and finding things you can partially do but need just a bit more learning to do and work towards that. Good luck learning",

A really good chef might show how they make something, but then you ask, how do you know this, how do you know that? How did you cut that chicken? They want to get to the point when they make something, not teach you all the basics of cooking.\n\nSimilarly, you want real-world code. That's difficult code. People aren't writing bubble sort by itself, something so self-contained and short that it can be explained. Also, when you ask an expert to explain something, unless they have experience teaching, they will skip over many detail that they assume you already know (but you may not). They may use a bunch of terminology that have no idea what they mean.\n\nThis is the problem with one-way communication. How much should an expert assume you know? At some point, if they have to tell you why a nested loop works, then they are spending more time teaching you the basics of programming, and not talking about the project the build.\n\nThey have videos of people coding, but then you watch them click this, type that, etc. They barely say anything so you get nothing from watching even though many beginners want  to see a real coder code until they realize it's like watching a real chess player play chess. It can be incredibly difficult for a master chess player say why they make certain moves. They can tell you why some moves are dumb and they see things you don't, but unless you start to play and get in those situations, watching an expert doesn't help.\n\nTo be fair, chess is a super extreme example, but at least you get the sense that even if you study for a year, you still couldn't figure out why a top chess player makes the move they do.\n\nIn effect you're saying\n\n> I want real-world code, but something super simple that I can understand, then explain all the detail and the thinking behind it as if I were five years old.\n\nMost experts explaining their code wouldn't do it at that level, but even if they could, they'd invariably leave something out that you would want explained. You don't have the ability to ask questions. \n\nWhat you really want is\n\n> I want to sit beside you and watch you code. I want you to have a running commentary telling me what you think.

Production code is often heavily abstracted and what you'd need to read to understand it isn't usually all on the screen at once. You're calling different services, using dependency injection, and other stuff that isn't easy to understand if you're trying to take it in all at once. \n\nMy recommendation would be to learn the basics of Python or JS, whichever you want, and then find a tutorial where you code along with the instructor while they build an actual project. If you go to Udemy, Academind has courses that follow that pattern. Their React course is particularly good and there are a few sections of that course where Max (the instructor) walks you through projects like that, and then challenges you later to try it on your own. It's a long course but it's worth the time (assuming you want to learn React.) They also have courses for Node and Python. \n\nGood luck to you.",

Initially I don't have knowledge about reactjs, so I study read the basics of it. Then, they gave me access the repository to see what their source code looks like and to see what tools, libraries they used. Nobody explained to me about how the source code interact to each other, you need to dig deep and learn to read .similar to php, never done it and laravel for backend so I need to teach myself. So I guess, what I would suggest is that.. try to build something you are interested.. then, once you finish try looking on open source project similar what you did and analyze it and how they did it.

Your goal is simply to write **one line of code that works** and breaks the loop of inaction.\n\n**2. Start with a \"Coherent Kernel\":** Don't start with the project; start with the smallest possible \"coherent kernel.\" Ask yourself: what is the absolute simplest, single thing this script must do?\n\n* Make it print \"Hello, World.\"\n* Make it open a single file and print its first line.\n* Make it take one number and add one to it. This is your anchor. It is a small, perfect, working system.\n\n**3. Begin the \"Forging Process\" (Iterative Refinement):** Now, begin the **\"Forging Process.\"** This is an iterative loop of critique and refinement. Add one tiny new feature. Does it still work? Good. Now, critique it. How could this one tiny function be cleaner or more efficient? Refine it. Then, add the *next* tiny feature. You are not building a cathedral from a blueprint; you are forging a single, perfect brick, and then another, and then another.\n\nBy reframing the problem this way, you move from a state of overwhelming, incoherent possibility to a state of focused, coherent, iterative action. You don't \"bridge the gap\"; you forge a path across it, one step at a time.\n\n\n\n# Zen (VMCI)",

This differs from Java where you have to declare a main function with specific syntax, and also declare a class that shares the name of the file you‚Äôve created.

It's just the thing you do when setting up your tools, to make sure compiling works, to make sure you can run the program that you just built, to make sure you can see what output your program is generating, etc.\n\nI think the book The C Programming Language explains it best. It seems like the book is the origin of the practice but according to the writing, the tradition was around before that. At that time, the message was apparently \"hello, world\" and not \"Hello, world!\" (i.e. someone added the capitalization and the punctuation to the tradition along the way):\n\n> [Printing the words hello, world] is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. ...\n\n> Just how to run [the hello, world program] depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in \".c\", such as hello.c, then compile it ...\n\nAnd then it continues to show how to do it on UNIX (steps which still work today on modern Linux, BSD, etc.).\n\n\"Create the program text somewhere\" may entail installing/learning to use a text editor in case you have not done so before. \"Compile it\" means you need a compiler and need to know how to use it. \"Load it and run it\" may mean you need to learn how to use your system's shell to run programs in case you don't know already. Or if you're using the GUI and double-clicking on it each time you want to run it, you may have to add in a \"press any key to continue . . .\" type of message to avoid that the terminal closes right after the program is done.\n\nNowadays you may also have to configure/inform your virus scanner that the code you are generating is not dangerous. Well, ..., technically the code may be dangerous. But you need to convince certain dynamic scanners that you are generating code intentionally and not trying to do something nefarious.\n\nIf you have an IDE a lot of this will be automated for you. Many IDEs today even automatically create a literal \"hello, world\" boilerplate for you when you create a new project. The idea is that you run that first to make sure it's working, then you change it to put in your \"real\" code and keep doing the same thing, to practice iterative development.",

What I did was to target the IT organization I already worked for. Since they were a .Net shop, I abandoned Node and went for C#. \n\nIt worked for me. I worked for a couple of years in .Net MVC before switching jobs. I never did end up working somewhere that used Node, although I've done some consulting work with it. \n\nI think it's smart to have a plan to get your first job. Target a few organizations with similar tech stacks and look for any opportunity to get into one of them. Help desk, QA, whatever. And then, dedicate yourself 100% to their tech stack and make no secret of how much you want to join their development team. Offer to build small utilities and try to solve problems with scripts, etc. Always have a project you're working on. \n\nIt's not an easy plan, but it's a plan. \n\nGood luck to you!",

The key is to get past that, be able to hear a simple problem, and figure out how to write code that accomplishes it.\n\nFor the vast majority of things you can think of, you won't have any idea how to write code that does that.\n\nBut for a few very simple tasks, you might be able to do that. For example, there is a game called \"Hangman\". Someone gives you a word. All you know is how many characters it has. Let's say the word is `pineapple`. You would only see \"---------\". that is, 9 dashes.\n\nThe goal is for someone to guess letters until the entire word is solved. A person is allowed to make 6 incorrect guesses before they lose. They aren't allowed to repeat a letter they've already used before. If they guess a letter correctly, you reveal its position. For example, suppose they guess `e`. Then, you show\n\n   ---e----e\n\nThis reveals the \"e\" at the end of \"pine\" and at the end of \"apple\". The other characters are hidden until the guesser guesses it correctly.\n\nThat's a program you might be able to code up with some basic knowledge of programming.\n\nCurrently, you are likely copying some existing code and getting it to work. Most people find they understand how code works, but when asked to write it, they don't know what to do. Their mind goes blank. You're starting to be a programmer when your mind doesn't go blank and you have some idea of what to do.",

Unfortunately the concept of thinking like a programmer and real problem solving skills doesnt get effectively communicated in courses. \n\nI think the issue of learning syntax 'too early' stems from general impatience and not understanding what programming entails. People want to see themseleves code, probably dont want to spend the first few lessons building those mental models even though it is a crucial aspect.\n\nAs i was reading the article, i realised this is equally applicable in learning a new codebase or framework. Read through and focus on the logic, the data flow, the why behind the what. Then when you understand why it is the way it is, go back and read the syntax, the specific methods used.\n\nInteresting read, thanks.",

I think it's a good primer for people who have no technical background, but trying to make anything non-trivial in it is an exercise in frustration.\n\nSo instead of a starting \"language\" I would say it's a good thing to spend an hour or two playing around with before jumping into real coding. I know that feeling like you're constantly treading water in the deep end is exhausting but honestly that's how you really learn a lot. Learning how to be comfortable with not fully understanding everything is an underrated skill.",

For this, I would recommend you to start with any one JavaScript tutorial (not a video; time-consuming). \n\nJust get good with the basics, Learn 2-3 things and do some practice, like write something yourself. Revise what you learn that day the next morning. After one week try to build something from what you have learnt. Once you are good at the basics, find some simple projects online and try to build them. Here you can depend on some YouTube videos, but I still recommend not wasting too much time there. First watch and learn how it's done, and then do it yourself without help. Then you should be able to come up with a new idea and build one. \n\nJavaScript has a lot of fun things to learn about, and there are many interesting libraries and tools.\n\nYou will be able to find useful resources here: [roadmap.sh/javascript](http://roadmap.sh/javascript) (if this is overwhelming for you),   \nYou can do freecodecamp: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project) or w3schools: [https://www.w3schools.com/js](https://www.w3schools.com/js)\n\nAfter you have done all this and are still serious about it, try LeetCode and crack some basic problems.",

So your stack could be anything essentially, if your application calls for a mobile or desktop app, then that would be taken into account for the stack. In this case, the stack would be ABC \\[languages used: XYZ, ZYX\\]. Tbh, it would be more of what the project or application requires, full stack generally refers to web apps, but a stack is just the software frameworks you will use from front to back end. Not sure if that helps but that's how I tend to think of it.",

Typically, when you have a simple set up like that the front end and integrations are part of a framework like node or react, and the backend is a small number of databases. Even in this case, it's probably best to have at least 3 teams, FE, BE, and integration.\n\nIn practice, stacks can be very complicated. If you're delivering an enterprise level event driven hybrid on-prem/cloud architecture in which your applications are composed of containerized microservices with k8 orchestrated auto scaling then you're probably not going to have any one guy on the team who both understands the full topology of your infrastructure and the nitty gritty of the code itself across all the different applications.

Also everything frontend is flooded with applicants and under high pressure due to AI automation. With basic coding and basic reporting in Data Analytics it‚Äôs similar. So I‚Äôd suggest you focus on cloud, backend, data science or machine learning. Learn the programming languages you need for that as much as possible and get the necessary and relevant certifications. Europe is still in need of moving its economies fully into the digital age, so there will be plenty of opportunities. But it‚Äôs specialists that will be needed, not generalists.

        "body": "You don't call `wait` to provide thread-safety. You call `wait` because you want to wait for something, and you want to do so in a thread-safe way.\n\nFor instance, suppose you're implementing something like `ArrayBlockingQueue`. If someone calls `take()` when the queue is empty, you want to block until it's non-empty and there's something to return. Therefore, the implementation of `take()` might need to call `wait()` on some underlying synchronization object. And conversely, the `put()` method calls `notify()` to wake up any thread that was waiting for the queue to become non-empty.\n\nThe reason `wait()` interacts with the same \"monitor\" that the `synchronized` keyword operates on is so that you can do this in a thread-safe way. For instance, suppose you do something like:\n\n    while (internalQueue.size() == 0) {\n        wait();\n    }\n\nIf you do this *without* holding a monitor that protects the queue state, then it's possible that after you check the queue size, but before you call `wait()`, somebody else will add something to the queue and raise a notification. But you've already made the decision to wait, and you missed the notification. So if a second object is never added to the queue, you might end up waiting forever, even though the queue contains an object. This can cause deadlocks.\n\nOn the other hand, if you hold the monitor the entire time you're waiting, then you prevent any other thread from adding anything to the queue. This also causes a deadlock.\n\nThe solution is for `wait()` to **atomically** release the monitor at the same time it suspends the current thread and adds it to the \"waiting\" list. And then when the thread wakes up again, it re-acquires the monitor. If you read the javadoc, that's exactly what `wait()` does, and this is why it does it.\n\n----\n\nIf you didn't have `wait()` and `notify()`, you would have to implement a blocking method with a spin-loop or polling, along the lines of:\n\n    while (true) {\n        synchronized (obj) {\n            if (internalQueue.size() > 0) {\n                // do stuff\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n        Thread.sleep(T); // sleep without holding the monitor so other threads can access the queue\n    }\n\nBut no matter what you do, this will perform poorly. If you set T to a small value (or zero) it will waste CPU repeatedly checking the queue when nothing has changed. If you set T to a large value, you will add a lot of latency and cause the CPU to unnecessarily sit idle.",

Though i recommend padding out your resume whether via internships or simple certifications cause entry level can be rough to get into. \n\n2) Not really, AI is here and it'll affect things but even if AI is used for coding it'll require actual programmers to fix its problems and implement things. It might limit how many jobs some companies would have but it won't take every job.\n\n3) Just about, maybe a tiny bit riskier especially since there's so many people that do it. Electrical is a very safe area in general since it's not as popular and so many areas need it. \n\n4) Frankly, just learn how to learn. Take in stride what your teachers say about how to get information. Because even years down the line there'll be points where you don't know what to do but if you can look up the right things in order to learn what you need you'll be good. \n\nGenerally uni will teach you coding from scratch so it's not like you need to learn a whole lot by yourself beforehand. Ofc that will help with assignments and allowing you to feel comfortable with coding but not required. I do recommend you learn a little with whatever language your school uses the most in order to be ahead of the curve. Also, look into the different areas of compsci, see which path may be interesting to you, this will change for sure as the years go on but its better to have an idea and change it than to start with nothing.",

While college programs don't usually require that you have any previous experience, it will be a big advantage for you to have already gotten some experience on your own time, especially if you're already familiar with the programming languages that specific college uses in its first few courses.\n\nIt is definitely possible to get really good at coding in five years. Going right into freelancing from that point is harder, though, because colleges don't really give you the set of skills you need to be a professional. Being a junior programmer on a team and learning about stuff like code reviewing and navigating large codebases and source control and development methodologies is sort of a separate education from the college degree.\n\nI'm not at all scared of AI taking the software jobs. I think it's a useful tool, but I don't imagine it replacing the need for programmers any time in the next few decades. On the other hand, plenty of people I respect disagree with me. AI is probably equally a threat to lots of jobs, including programming but also art, engineering, and medicine. I wouldn't worry too much about programming specifically.\n\nMy advice: figure out what programming language your intended university uses for its introductory classes. Learn that language. Find a big pile of beginner coding problems and regularly practice. Try and do something fun with programming that ties to some interest of yours. Make a game. Make a guitar tuner. Make a thing that calculates football statistics. Whatever you find interesting.",

I started out with two years of informatics lecture in my school which ended 3 years before I graduated Gymnasium (I think similar to high school). I can tell you that I did manage to get my Bachelors degree (but not with high grades) and my Masters degree did work out much better.   \nI can tell you, that you will learn coding well enough if it is similar to my experience in Germany. But as you go on I felt that theory is taught over practical things and I felt little prepared to enter the job marked. What I would suggest more than focusing on learning everything there is to know in theory, get a job on the side and learn there. \n\nI feel the need to tell you that if given the chance of doing it again I would not study CS anymore I would start out working and earning certificates on the side, but that is my personal experience.  \nIf you want to learn some techniques of CS and if you have the spare money to earn some degrees, I would recommend Hack the Box (students pay less per month) and Portswigger/BurpSuite. They are really beginner-friendly.\n\nRegarding AI, I think if you get some courses in CS focusing on AI you would get a head start, as many currently employed and finishing students did not get the possibility to take these. But there are also different specialties in CS that only few people want to specialize in. Most of the students in my experience are not really good at the mathematical part (e.g. cryptography), I have an interest in law in the side of being a CS major and worked for some time in a field which focused on the area where these two specialties meet. There are not a lot of law students who have an interest in computer and not a lot of CS students have an interest in law. If you want to be special find an area which most of your peers do not like and get good at it :)\n\nIf you have any further questions feel free to message me :)",

This is assuming that each player needs to use up all of their moves each turn.\n\nI've used screentop to prototype some things in the past and it was a little limiting, I think it's better for card games, and of course complex mechanics need to be manually enforced between players. Godot is also a good option for these kinds of prototypes, GDscript is flexible like Python which I've found is good for playtesting and prototyping",

It sounds like for your particular app, you care most about the day in which something happened, according to the person who did an action on that day. The fact that an event happened at 8am for one user but was simultaneous with an event that happened at 9pm the previous day for a different user is NOT important to your app.\n\nThere's no single best answer. For your case, I think storing the local date in one column, local start time in another column, local end time in a third column, and timezone offset in a fourth might be one easy solution.\n\nThat would make finding all events on a particular day trivial. The only tricky thing might be if someone traveled across time zones in one day, but it would still handle that just fine. Everything would still be stored relative to the local day.",

That doesn't mean it's \"impossible\", but the stuff you're asking for is really specific, and you'd have to find some tool that somebody else has already written that does the exact steps you want.\n\nIf you don't want to spend a few months learning to code, I think your options are either hiring a freelancer or using AI.\n\nI think what you'll find with those approaches is that what you're asking for isn't necessarily that hard, but specifying EXACTLY what you want it to do is actually harder than you think. Your descriptions are decent but the devil is in the details.\n\nHere's a good way to think about it: if you gave your instructions to ten average college students and asked them to MANUALLY follow your steps, do you think they'd all get the same result? If not, then if you asked someone to write a program to execute your steps then there are multiple valid ways to interpret your instructions and you might not get what you want.\n\nI do have one question for you: do you have a strong preference for where this transformation should happen? You mentioned the word \"column\" - are you using Excel right now? Does this program need to work with your Excel spreadsheet or could it work with text files?",

At that point you should basically have computer code that is a computer version of what the Wikipedia article is telling you.\n\nIf SICP has a \"mathematical background\" section in the appendix, I would try reading that first and then representing all of the notation as code as a sort of \"translation\".",

By practicing and reading and researching, so check it out if you're looking for a good course, it teaches HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some backend fundamentals like Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. As for how long it took me, I mean it took me about 3 months to finish just the JavaScript course because I was really taking my time with it, but in reality the amount of time it takes you to learn doesn't really matter. What matters is that you practice and you stay consistent.\n\nAs for AI tools, I really only think they're good for people who don't care that much about the technical side of web development. Creating software isn't as simple as just sitting down and coding, in the real-world there is some real planning that goes behind it because real people will be using that product. So, don't get discouraged by it, I've used AI here and there and it's super unpredictable and unreliable and in an industry where creating reliable and predictable software is key, I don't think AI will get very far in replacing any programmers. Also, if you're planning on building real and useful skills I would suggest staying away from AI as much as possible when coding. If you want to learn how something works or you need project ideas then sure, AI is great for that, but as soon as you start using it for generating code your skills will go downhill because it gives you a false sense of learning. You'll see the AI's code and you'll say \"oh yeah that makes sense, that's simple\" and you'll feel like you can do it too but then when you try out a project and you try to make anything by yourself then you're going to realize that you're stuck because learning isn't watching and reading code, it's writing and understanding and breaking things. So, if you're going to use AI for learning, be very wise with it and don't use it for generating code. Also, don't be scared of the struggle of learning, you're not going to understand everything and that's okay. Struggle is learning.",

        "body": "The short answer is that being good at this is entirely what being a \"senior developer\" is about. It's a very broad and deep skillset that you develop through experience. You can eventually develop this experience on your own, but it's not going to happen fast. I made a lot of stupid design decisions when I was a junior dev.\n\nIf it's important for your startup to be building good software in the short term, then your startup needs to hire senior developers, both to make good decisions and to mentor juniors.\n\nSo it's not even remotely possible to do your questions justice in the span of a Reddit comment, but I'll try anyway:\n\n> How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.\n\nUnderstand *how* queries and indexes work: how the data is structured internally (e.g. as a B-tree) and what the DB engine is doing when you write a query, especially when it involves joining multiple tables. Have this knowledge in mind every single time you write a query. Inspect the DB's query planner output (e.g. using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) to confirm your assumptions.\n\n> How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what‚Äôs hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.\n\nThere are a gazillion tools for this, including basic ones like the Unix `top` command. I don't have experience with New Relic but I've used Datadog (flexible, but very expensive) and much simpler self-hosted tools like Prometheus.\n\nThe important thing is to measure, and then drill down into those measurements to figure out what to measure next. If your app \"feels slow\", add lots of timers to measure which parts are slowest. Try to reproduce the problem locally and use whatever local profiling tools are available in your language. If one user request \"fans out\" and depends on lots of different subrequests, then the 99th-percentile latency of those subrequests matters more than the average.\n\n> How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.\n\nTest automation is critical if you care about software quality. Write test cases alongside your code. For core logic, you can use unit tests, along with test coverage tools to help make sure you don't have obvious gaps in testing. For UI, the testing strategy depends on what framework you're using.\n\n> How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?\n\nUnderstand the general kinds of mistakes that lead to security flaws. There are lots and lots of these -- buffer overflows, escaping mistakes, confused deputy attacks, time-of-check-to-time-of-use, and so on. Be knowledgeable enough to recognize these, and disciplined enough to guard against them. Get other skilled developers to *carefully* review your code.\n\n> Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?\n\nImpossible to answer in the abstract. A system is \"overengineered\" if it has more complexity than necessary to accomplish its goals. So you need to do a detailed analysis of your actual requirements, and the actual behavior of the complex option vs. the simple one.\n\n> Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?\n\nThere are a lot of opinions about this but I'll just quote from [\"The Grug Brained Developer\"](https://grugbrain.dev/):\n\n\"grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too\"\n\n\"seem very confusing to grug\"",

Is there desire to  grow and take this public or is the intent to sell it off to a larger concern. That at least tells you if there is enough money or resources in your future to make real changes in your areas of concern. \n\nTo find your hot spots (frequently called or slow bottle-neck code)  products like DynaTrace and App Dynamics are helpful. There are many vulnerability scanning tools like Veracode, Black Duck etc. As for database optimizations that depends on your platform but lots of tools will suggest indexes to help performance and eliminate table scans. \nHang in there. If your company is trying to grow, their focus is likely on adding customers through new  features and much of what you are worried about will be pushed to the back as \"technical debt\" until your platform actually crashes, or gets hacked out of operating and held for ransom.",

I think you're hitting on a fundamental issue which is that software development is an extremely unregulated and undisciplined field. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to any of the questions you're asking about, and still manage to have careers just cranking out sub-par code. (Especially nowadays when it's easy to just rubber-stamp the output of an LLM.) And on the other hand, if you push yourself, there is no upper limit to how much you can learn, or how much care you can put into your work.\n\nBut there's not really an objective, accepted standard for you to measure your skills by. There's just the outcome of your projects, and the judgment of your peers.\n\nThe good news is that there are a lot of extremely smart people in the field who have published a lot of text and video content that you can learn from. You don't necessarily have to take everything they say as gospel. Pay attention to the things they say that resonate with you, and use them as jumping-off points for your own explorations.\n\nJust as an example, you can find a lot of interesting talks from the now-defunct Strange Loop conference. Check out [\"Simple Made Easy\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich Hickey (designer of Clojure) and [\"The Mess We're In\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) by Joe Armstrong (designer of Erlang). Or if you care about security, look for interesting talks from DEFCON or CCC. Pick a random topic that interest you, and if it turns out to be way over your head, the stuff they talk about will at least give you more topics to research.\n\nAlso, check out software-related social media such as Hacker News or Lobste.rs (if you can trust yourself not to use them for procrastination). Don't get me wrong, those sites have a lot of bad opinions and irrelevant content. But they can serve as a good way to stay in tune with the zeitgeist of what other tech-savvy people are thinking about.\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah, and you'll probably find more useful advice over in /r/ExperiencedDevs than in this subreddit. To be honest, I think your questions are so broad that you wouldn't necessarily get comprehensive answers there either. But you can browse through previous discussion threads to see the kinds of advice that senior devs give.",

Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?\n\nThis question gets asked over and over again, and the answer is the same: practicing **with** AI will not help much if you want to get better at coding **without** AI.\n\nThis especially applies to the skill of taking a complex problem and breaking it down to simpler subproblems. This is what programming is really about, and everything else (like the syntax of different programming languages) is trivial in comparison. And if you're always letting AI spoon-feed you by telling you what bullet-pointed subproblems to solve, you're never practicing that skill, so it will never improve.\n\nIf you're unsure whether you could rebuild your projects from scratch without AI, then why not just try it, and see where you run into difficulties?\n\nIf you get stuck, try reading documentation, or even taking existing examples and seeing what happens when you modify them. If you insist on using AI tools, then don't ask them to write code for you, or even come up with a design. Ask them to suggest learning resources (e.g. documentation websites) or project ideas.\n\nIf you're still repeatedly getting stuck trying to rebuild your projects from scratch, then it's a sign that your skills really are underdeveloped. So go back and do the same thing, designing and coding from scratch, on a simpler/easier problem. Repeat as necessary.\n\nFinally, practice your research skills. When there's something you want to learn about, practice searching online for it, reading what other people have said about it, and thinking up your own follow-up queries. Don't just let a chatbot tell you what it thinks is the right answer.",

For games, Unity will teach you a lot, though some types of games rely heavily on algorithms (pathfinding, procedural generation, optimization).

Any *actual* animation that a user makes will have some finite length, even though there's no predefined upper limit on how big that can be.\n\nAny standard data structure such as a list, dictionary, etc. will allow you to put as many entries in it as you want. The only practical limit is the amount of available memory. \n\n(Technically, there's usually also an upper limit defined by the maximum value of the integer variable storing the data structure's size, typically on the order of 2^31 which is roughly 2 billion. But you're likely to run out of memory long before you hit that limit. And nobody is likely to be creating animations with 2 billion frames.)\n\n>  See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.\n\nThe specific programs you asked about are closed-source and proprietary, so the source code isn't published anywhere. Google can't find something that doesn't exist on the internet.\n\nThere's a 2D animation program called Synfig Studio which is open source: https://github.com/synfig/synfig/ But it has hundreds of thousands of lines of code so it's not going to be easy to understand for a beginner.\n\nBut see, for instance, this class which defines a `Keyframe` object and a `KeyframeList` which is a sorted list of keyframes at different times: https://github.com/synfig/synfig/blob/master/synfig-core/src/synfig/keyframe.h",

So it might feel like a waste of time if you don't land a job in the industry.\n\nJust want to say that you're not the only one out there. We are all just rats in a wage cage. I think finding any work at all will help your mental. Don't worry so much if it's not in your industry. Making money, feeling productive, and pursuing things outside of work may help you feel more fulfilled. Don't let this shitty CS market bring you down too much.",

A lot of companies are downsizing and closing departments, slowly but surely. \n\nI'm working in a field with a lot of overlap between different industries, and I'm seeing a tendency to fire people without replacements in mind. No outsourcing either, but increasing workload for those remaining while wages are stagnating.\n\n\n\nIn the next 2-3 years, our seniors will leave, that's roughly 40% of our workforce and there are no replacements; with our specific skill set, we need at least three years of training. You can imagine how that will end. I'm already looking for something else because without enough staff we can't run projects, and without projects we are going to bleed dry quickly, as costs of operations are high.\n\nIn general, less companies properly invest in junior talent, they just looking at short term value extraction, then move on to the next opportunity to exploit. Or just stick with their current workforce and try to remain as profitable as possible without blatantly violating labor laws.\n\nI honestly don't know what's wrong, it's like people in charge had their brains fried during COVID or something.",

Do what you have to do to survive, I had to sell some investments to stay afloat.\n\nYes it is very demoralizing, it was my first time being laid off and I didn't realize how much of my feeling of self worth was tied to gainful employment prior to that, the depression sucked, but after some soul searching and figuring out what I actually wanted to pursue and what I would be good at, I took on other things that gave me purpose. I used my free time to volunteer for causes that were important to me, and I got to build some APIs that helped streamers fundraise for Planned Parenthood (we ended up raising over $60k grassroots) and eventually it was this project that landed me a role at a large nonprofit where I currently work. It's funny because I didn't do it with the purpose of landing a job, I legitimately just wanted to help out the cause and later when I found a nonprofit job posting that matched my skillset I realized it would be very relevant to them and I'm pretty sure that's what set me apart from the other candidates.",

Felt we were quite clearly going to do some sort of data fetching, list rendering and filtering. Nope, full blown JS fundamentals challenge around building a Wordle game in 45 minutes, obviously no AI allowed. Bumbled my way through the whole thing trying to remember the best way to map over stuff and comparing index's for matches and partial matches. Didn't even get close to finishing. Was surprised they did that challenge despite looking for a RN dev as it‚Äôs a different vertical than what they are looking for.\n\nSecond company interview didn't send any prep, passed the second round which was a live 1 hour coding test in RN, third round was a discussion on architecture with some white-boarding. Passed it until they pulled a gotcha right at the end with 15 minutes to go. Gave me another coding test on JS fundementals, which I passed, not satisfied they deleted that one and gave me another with 5 minutes to go that I couldn't finish in the allotted time. They haven't even bothered to get back to me.\n\nI question the people who decided the processes to be honest, I don't think they know what they're looking for.

Also, the industry by the time you are that age could be a totally different landscape (like it was for them).\n\nIn general though, I find almost nobody sticks with the same career path their whole lives. It's a far better trait to be adaptable and smart in this world we currently live in than pigeonhole yourself into a specific career. School makes you think you go to school and always stick with the same path. It never really turns out that way. Most do at least lateral shifts if not major ones.",

The overzealous vibe coder trope.\n\nWhat that underlying question is looking for is not to shit talk AI and be dismissive of it, nor is it to circle-jerk over AI and how it's revolutionized your life. It wants a more measured answer that talks about the pros/cons of AI, where it's useful, where it's not, and demonstrating understanding that it needs to be used with caution no matter where it's used.\n\nWe all get that it's not good at complex tasks. We all get that it sucks at being able to understand business logic to do anything useful. We all get it sucks when it needs to work in a large codebase across multiple files.\n\nBut it has some pros you didn't seem to mention at all.... the biggest one, which is what I use it for regularly, is as a faster Stack Overflow. Back in the day, when I was getting some error I wasn't sure why I was getting, I'd go Google that error. Then I'd sift through Stack Overflow questions until I find one that's close enough related to what I was doing that it can push me in the right direction, and usually hit my head against a wall until things finally work.\n\nNowadays when I get an error, I type into Copilot \"Why am I getting \\[pasted error\\]?\". Copilot looks at my code, scours the internet/docs to find answers that are directly relevant to my code, and can give me relevant answers way faster than I could get on my own. It's of course not always right on the first try, but with a follow up prompt or 2 I almost always end up with an easy fix with very little effort from me. This is like 90% of what I use AI for, and it's absolutely been a massive benefit.\n\nI also like it for very mundane tasks that are conceptually simple, but are time consuming. Coming up with unit tests is one. AI can easily read code paths, and shit out enough tests to get good coverage. It's usually pretty bad at *implementing* the unit tests, but I can take over from there, it did the boring part for me.\n\nAI's also great at just asking general questions. Why read through AWS's terrible docs when I can ask a single prompt, and get a right answer most of the time.\n\nI'm on your side that I think AI's pretty bad at doing most code generation tasks beyond very simple or very isolated stuff.... but you're being overly dismissive if you can't think of any ways it can make your life easier.",

        "body": "Corporate Tech Recruiter here.  There are a couple of differences I want to call out in response to some of these comments and to address OP‚Äôs question \n\nFirst, there are different types of recruiters: agency and corporate.  Agency recruiters work for a staffing company that services lots of clients.  Corporate recruiters are internal staff at one company and only\nwork on openings for that company\n\nAn agency recruiter indeed does have high metrics they need to meet and will tend to send LOTS of invites/messages.  They are usually working on multiple jobs and building pipelines for the various clients and skill sets they know their clients need.  LinkedIn typically produces a less than 10% response rate for recruiter pings so you need to send a very high volume to get traction\n\nCorporate recruiters do also send a decent number of invites/messages via LinkedIn but are typically more selective.  We do have metrics as well but they are typically focused on actual candidates moving forward versus connects.  Corporate recruiters also pipeline and fight the low response rate but because we are measured more on speed of filling a job, our approach is more targeted.\n\nSo why are you getting tons of pings when you haven‚Äôt engaged with your LI profile?  Likely bc of the skills you selected in your profile, your job titles, the companies you‚Äôve worked for, etc. These pings are likely agency recruiters or sourcers ( those that literally feed recruiters profiles to reach out to).\n\nPersonally as a corporate recruiter, I‚Äôm only  reaching out to those that have a well built profile so I can validate if they could be a match.  But it is true, we are using linkedin to source even though we are we are drowning resumes. For example, I have a SDE 2 role open that hit 2k apps in 3 days of posting with only 10% meeting the location requirements.  From there only 5% meeting the bare minimum experience.  Add to this the number of AI generated fake resumes, the folks that lie about being in the location or other qualifications and that pool of 2k apps is maybe 50-60 decent matches.\n\nI understand how tough this market is and how hard it is to be a job seeker ( I HATE the BS so many companies put candidates through) but it also makes it hard is as recruiters to find you through all the noise.",

I have ADHD for example and I interrupt my coworkers all the time but they live with me.\n\nADHD is a poor proxy for understanding what it‚Äôs like to live with autism, so please do not take this as me attempting to be reductionist toward legitimate struggles, but one thing I have found helpful is to stop assuming my condition is the barrier I‚Äôm facing. It might CONTRIBUTE to the barrier, but plenty of people before and after me have had ADHD undiagnosed their entire lives and they never even knew. I‚Äôm glad mental health is so well-known these days, but these conditions are not new and plenty before us have succeeded. Being a bit quiet, or loud, or odd, or by-the-book, or socially inexperienced are not traits limited to people with autism or ADHD. And all of us can improve.\n\nI had crippling social anxiety starting my first job and now I‚Äôm getting promoted and my boss explicitly mentioned I‚Äôm extremely well-liked in the office. People like my empathy more than they give a damn about my ADHD. Gen Z in general struggles with social skills because we were locked in a room during COVID for core developmental years.\n\nDon‚Äôt panic, you‚Äôll be fine.\n\nedit: and watch The Residence on Netflix if you haven‚Äôt. If you pride yourself in your technical skills and know you are autistic then it could be a nice reminder that autism makes some people better at their jobs. Your brain works differently than most and that can be quite handy.",

But it‚Äôs far from the majority - and not enough to make a dent in this area. \n\nAnd the final issue is that the reality is that a lot people still enjoy the work enough in return for that $300k a year‚Ä¶ it give purpose and something to do.

I was having a beer with him on day and asked him why he was still working at the age of 40 and did not need to. His answer was pretty simple:\n- he had been a hobby coder before starting college and liked it. \n- he retired for a while, but drove his wife crazy. \n- this money he could spend on whatever he wanted, without concern. \n- it gave him a sense of purpose. \n\nHe was motivated, despite not ‚Äòneeding the job‚Äô worked just as hard as anyone else.

They were underpaying me, and I turned down a few better offers because it was a startup and they promised that they will make the salary better when the acquisition went through (I helped them on the due diligence docs, so I knew they were close) plus a bonus. \n\nWell the acquisition closed, everything was fine, champagne was had, etc. I asked for my promised bump, the CEO stalled, and stalled hard. They brought in a consultant who tried to talk down to me and make me back down. This guy looked me in the face and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre worth $150K, $40k or what.‚Äù After one or two weeks of back and forth like that, I gave up and just started searching. About 2 weeks after I stopped talking about it, I think the CEO figured out I was probably not happy, and gave me their promised pay bump. I gave my two weeks a few days after. \n\nI learned two things from that experience, first you have a choice in what you spend your energy on. It can be fighting for a raise, or it can be find a healthier and better position. It‚Äôs up to you. Second, if you have to justify your value to someone else, and your salary is a measure of your value, then either you value your self too highly, or they don‚Äôt value you enough, either way, this always leads to a toxic environment and you should probably just bow out. \n\nNow, I don‚Äôt even really bring up salary points. I just tell my manager if I feel valued, and this is what I do for the company, and they get the message and talk to their manager about getting a raise because they value me. And if they don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll find someone who does.",

Those have nearly all disappeared - so don't get your hopes up in landing a job at the few that remain. Remote is now tied to the local market rate for talent, and even takes a haircut for the \"convenience\" of being remote.\n\nBefore you do something irrational in an otherwise crappy job market, evaluate the \"total value\" of your setup which includes:\n\n1. Your total compensation (base, bonus, equity)\n2. Your company provided benefits.\n3. The convenience of being able to WFH (reduced transportation costs, time savings, reallocated travel time to fitness/health/wellbeing)\n4. The social benefits provided by your country (health care, pharmacare, etc)\n5. The purchasing power you have per euro/dollar spent\n\nIts very important that you actually measure the value of (#3-5) in order to compare the \"real compensation\" you earn. Most folks younger in their careers only measure #1, and #2 only comes nominally later when you have kids. As a result they are easier to manipulate when the industry is in a boom.\n\nYou should index your total compensation against the percentiles for your country. 73K euro could put you in the top 5%, 10% (many european countries), 15% (e.g. Canada), or 30% (e.g. US) of earners depending on the country you reside in. This will help you ground your expectations a little more.\n\nIts not wrong to demand more compensation for increased scope of responsibility and outcomes delivered. However, you want to weigh your situation before engaging in a confrontation with your company/CEO. If you already have a better offer lined up, then the risk versus reward of engaging in the confrontation is tipped in your favor. If you're in a low percentile earner in your country/region (e.g. 80-100%), then you may not have much to lose and more to gain.\n\nThere is a good time to engage in this kind of dialogue, and a bad time to do so. Good times are when there is lots of hiring, easy-to-find opportunities, and very few people available to replace you. At this very moment in 2025, it is a bad time to engage in wage negotiations without something like a Union backing you. Depending on the percentile compensation, there are many people willing to take up the task.",

For instance, with frontend web, just start with plain HTML/CSS/JS, then start bringing in some libraries like JQuery (or maybe could skip this part), then move onto more modern frameworks like React, etc. And similarly when learning something like React, just start with that, then later start integrating other libraries into it (say for state management, etc.). \n\nWhat parts of git, CI/CD, unit testing, DBs, are you struggling with?\n\nAlso maybe some books on different architectural design topics might help with the OOP or general software design principles.",

Frameworks are abstractions of behavior. And like most of the not low level software, it's made up of low level software. So maybe read up on how to make a rest server from the ground up. Or how to use JS to create a simple framework. Granted that's if you want to go in that area.\n\nAlternative look for roles more focused on C/Unix, you can also start using AI tools to judge your code and see what they come up with. As much as we hate AI it can be used to learn what to learn. Ask what's expected of a Dev in a role you want, then make it give you a small project to practice the skills you are lacking. But keep in mind that you can't simply code for yourself, you gotta pretend someone will have to use your code sooner rather than later. 5 years ago getting feedback on thst without coworkers was hard, but now you can ask AI to help you figure out how to do something better.\n\nGit and CI/CDs are tools, learn them like such, an online class for git will teach you more than you need.\n\nTesting your own code should just become 2nd nature to you for low level, it's just code that verified other code is doing what you expect it to. Web framework tests have more in mind depending what you are testing, so I wouldn't touch that just yet.\n\nAs for OOP C code, have you tried looking at how some popular repos do it? Tbh certain languages have poor OOP implementations so it will always look ugly for them. And tbh some OOP code will be ugly regardless due to the complexity they can accumulate.\n\nDon't give up!

Will you be a 1099 contractor?\n\nIf yes to the above questions then you'll have an opportunity to open a solo 401k. Why a solo 401k? Say you leave your main employer. You now have the option to rollover your 401k funds into the solo 401k. This is opposed to doing a rollover to an IRA.\n\nWhy do this?\n\nWith a solo 401k you get two advantages:\n\n* Controlling the fund menu within a 401k. Meaning you can have access to favorable funds.\n* Keeping your money outside of pretax IRA space. This is important if you are doing the backdoor Roth IRA strategy where a positive pretax IRA balance will influence pro rata taxation on traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions.\n\nThere is also a third advantage.\n\nA 401k has an annual limit for both employee and employer contributions. For 2025 employee contribution limit is $23.5k. Employer limit is $46.5k. So a total of $70k.\n\nThe employee limit is the aggregate of all 401ks under your name within the calendar year. The employer limit is **per 401k acccount**. In other words if you have access to two 401ks and actively working for both employers then you can, at maximum, have access to $23.5k + 2 \\* $46.5k = $116.5k space. This scales up with every 401k you have access to.\n\nSo with the solo 401k you can contribute 20% of your net self-employment income on the employer contribution side of things.\n\nYou just need a valid reason to open a solo 401k. Once it is open it can remain open even if you no longer generate self employment income.",

Hard leetcode problems right out the door. Back-tracking, dynamic programming questions. Zero hints.

There's a reason why Asian cultures around the world, rank the highest in mathematics and science and absolutely dominate every single other country in the world over these two subjects.\n\nUnfortunately, what this produces are candidates that are so fucking good at math and science. The academic, technical, algorithm part of programming, is a laughable endeavor for a large majority of them.

At my university there was no real campus life, more like a regular job where you go and then take the train back home (last time I was at UCI the huge area for parking freaked me out again lol, the universities around Boston were much more similar to what I've been used to).\nThen I first had to Google all those \"dean's list\" things etc. ;)\n\nBut that's been even worse for Asian CVs. Everyone's a medal winner for something, a ton of different ranks and levels etc. \n\nEuropean CVs are usually rather plain in that regard and more descriptive (longer CVs and photos have been around for much longer as well. When I started you also had to put age and confession and martial status etc.  - awful). It's fun to see that often when the descriptions are very mathy and technical, probably C or C++ mentioned, it's often Eastern Europe while for example Germans have a very business- and process-oriented language (requirements analysis (\"Pflichtenheft\" ;)) and ISO standards and optimizing business processes blabla Siemens mainframe blabla).\n\nHiring internationally is interesting but also exhausting.\nBesides the business lingua CVs the worst I found to be the Indian CVs listing everything under the sun (experts in Gmail, excel, YAML, XML, JSON, Jira, Slack... basically dumping their current browser tabs and pyproject.toml/requirements.txt in the CV).\n\nI'm definitely on the conversational side but I'd say half the people we rejected obviously didn't have a lot of depth in what they've been talking about (e g. tell you which model they used and once you talk about it it comes obvious they haven't even read the abstract of the respective paper). Other half is social aspects, obviously not caring about the topic they should be working on, being super hard to talk to or just plain cocky, forgetting about the interview, not letting others speak/speaking over interviewers all the time, suddenly sharing their screen to show their bitcoin price predictor after we tried to wrap up the interview 5 times because it's been 9PM for us etc.",

I don't think it's in your best interest to sit around and tell you that you're doing fine and that you're not struggling when you clearly are, so I won't. Chances are, you're part of the problem too. \n\n\\> I have been working in the same feature for at least 10 months now.\n\nThis is not good, if I'm being honest. Even in the worst places I've worked I've seldom actually seen a single feature take that long to finish without reasonable blockers. If the issue is genuinely \"I don't know how to do this\" then you and management both have issues. \n\nNo one typically just lets a feature story just creep for 10 months without bringing it up to either backlog it or give it to someone more capable. Not saying it never happens, it's just incredibly rare that it would go for so long without anyone checking. Especially if you work somewhere remotely credible or a start-up. \n\n\\> The last thing that happened that pushed me to the edge is that the manager asked a Senior to help me out with this feature and he just started asking a bunch of questions of the technical decisions I made and was ultimately confused and suggested we change a lot of stuff to make things right, basically saying that the last 9 months of work was poorly done by me.\n\nThis speaks to me that people are tired with your work and that you are not prioritizing your learning and improvement at all. You're telling me that you didn't update anyone on your work for 9 straight months? You didn't communicate with a single person on your team to get feedback on a PR or something? This sounds really unbelievable and I really doubt this story as being true. Whatever though, assuming it is true; I understand people are going to tell you that it's management's job or your senior's job or someone else's job to teach you and make sure that you're doing well but it's really a two way street. You also need to communicate to them properly, especially as an engineer with four years of experience. You're far beyond the point of being some baby junior who doesn't know how to get the job done, or at least you should be. \n\nIt's part of your job to make sure you're improving and actually getting better. If you're constantly bumbling into the same problems, constantly asking the same question, and constantly not able to get work finished, then you might have a motivation issue.",

As others have said, you're just starting mid to senior engineering roles, that's a lot more responsibility and requires a different mindset. \n\nAre there some things you could be doing better? Yeah, probably. But honestly, from what you've described, this seems like a systematic communication issue between the team. How large are the sprints? How large are the features that you're working on? Do they encourage you to talk to other teammates to get advice? Do they encourage you to find optimal solutions before implementing them? Or do they just want you to shit out a feature as quickly as possible before the Sprint ends? \n\nI went through something similar because I don't have a degree and every few months the imposter syndrome would hit me hard. But then I would reflect on my work, what I've contributed, what I've done poorly and what I've done well. Over time I realized that, while I have made mistakes, a lot of the issues I had were systemic and involved me to build the environment I wanted to work in. \n\nJust something to think about. Hang in there.\n\nEDIT: Also, I would like to add, no developer should be working on one feature for 10 months. Even in my worst moments on the job, a feature would take 2 months max before management or a senior could clearly see that I was struggling and would step in to help, or pivot me to something else. This is another sign that this might be management and not you. Again, I don't know you and I don't know your work ethic, so I can't say that you're perfect or anything, but anecdotally, and based off of what I've read, that's just what it seems like.",

He usually asks why I did things a certain way, and why I didn‚Äôt go down a different route. This either ends up with him agreeing it was a sensible decision, or suggesting looking into alternatives. When you reach out for feedback on a regular basis, acting upon it becomes far more manageable and feels much less like your work is getting crapped on.\n\nYou can‚Äôt expect every line of code you‚Äôve wrote and decision you‚Äôve made over the span of 9 months to be the best option available. That‚Äôs an insane standard. Recognize that all developers are prone to making mistakes or suboptimal decisions, and take the initiative to reach out to your senior developers and get feedback more frequently.\n\nPersonally I ask my architect to be brutal when critiquing my code so I can avoid repeating the same mistakes even when they‚Äôre small.\n\nWhen you go 9 months without reaching out for feedback you‚Äôre pretty much asking for every subpar decision you‚Äôve made to be pointed out to you all at once. It can be hard to take that without it feeling like 9 months of effort is being crapped on.\n\nAsk for feedback more regularly, act upon it quickly, and take everything you learn from it with you moving forward. It also has the bonus of making the work feel more collaborative, and helps build a good reputation with your seniors in my experience.\n\nEdit: just to clarify, when I mention getting feedback, I will literally hop on a call with my architect and walk him through all the code changes since the last time he‚Äôs seen it, explain what it does, and give him a minute to glance over it. It usually ends up with him either saying ‚Äúlooks good‚Äù or asking more questions and then suggesting changes or accepting the reasoning. This approach allows the architect or senior to take some accountability for the code you‚Äôre writing which takes some of the pressure off.",

        "body": "TL;DR: I wrote a goddamn novel so here's the brief. A lot of fresh graduates go through what you're going through. You're not alone, you are capable, and if nobody else has said it, I fully believe in you. Build cool stuff you want to build while you're applying to jobs. Apply to those jobs anyways, because most skills are taught on the job in the first 6 months.\n\nI never finished my degree, however, I did take a lot of college courses on computer science. I have to be honest, college really does not teach you much in terms of preparing you for working on the job. If you think about it, it makes sense, a lot of jobs require you to understand tooling, specific frameworks, working within a team building, large-scale applications, etc. \n\nThe issue is that frameworks change, if you spent a semester learning Spring, .NET, NEXT.JS, they could all have insane updates mid-semester that would require the professor to alter their coursework mid-semester. With that being said, this stuff is really hard to teach. The tech industry is constantly moving forward and evolving. \n\nBecause of this, a lot of degrees in computer science focus on theory, data structures and algorithms, maybe programming language fundamentals and, if you pick a specific focus, AI for example, GIS, or game design or whatever, you learn that niche.\n\nThat's why a lot of jobs don't require degrees and seldom hire Junior developers that have degrees. Especially in today's job market. People with degrees can prove that they made it through their coursework and they might have some capstone projects under their belt. But they can't code their way out of a wet paper bag, or they don't have a lot of real on-the-job experience. You shouldn't let that stop you though.\n\nYou should know that you are good at what you do, you have the degree. You've proven that you can do the work even if you just coasted. Just work on a bunch of personal projects, building stuff that interests you. It doesn't have to be big or glamorous, just stuff you enjoy. You will quickly gain a skill set that you would want to enter the job market for. It could be full stack development, mobile development, game development, front end, back end, big data, whatever. Right now, just focus on building cool shit. \n\nA lot of programmers leaving college are in the exact same boat you are in. They have a degree, they're kind of good at coding, and they understand theory, now what? I'll just say this as a trade secret, 90% of engineers that have a job, learned what they know now on the job. Unless you're applying to mid to senior level roles or doing contract work, most jobs teach you everything during \"ramp up\" which usually takes about 6 months. \n\nYou got this, man. Take it one day at a time and don't be discouraged if you get rejected constantly. The job market is tough right now but, I believe in you. Good luck.",

But there's a really deadly spiral that a fair amount of people get stuck in.\n\nThey land at a shit job where the things you're talking about are the norm, then they get burned out and desperate for a new job, and because of that desperation they fail to do their due diligence in the reverse interview and/or aren't picky enough with the new job, so they end up somewhere just as bad. Rinse and repeat, and your entire career is just shit job after shit job.\n\nIt's a hard cycle to break once you're in it, because you never ditch that feeling of desperation.\n\nLayoff/management changes aren't really unique to our industry. What is fairly unique to this industry is our painful interviews, which only makes it harder to get out of the deadly spiral once you're in it because you're both burnt out from your shit job, *and* the shit interview process. Double burnout.\n\n>How do I just find some peace in this field?\n\nSo the things you're talking about re: stress, unrealistic deadlines, mismanagement, shit culture, etc aren't *inherent* of this field. They're inherent of toxic companies. The trick is finding a company that isn't toxic. Just because a company has lower pay doesn't mean they'll be lower stress/not toxic. Just because a company has higher pay doesn't mean they'll be higher stress/toxic.\n\nThis requires you to get really get at reverse-interviewing to sus out companies like that, *and* to be able to have the patience to not humor offers from companies that sound like they'll have cultures like that. I've said \"No thanks\" to plenty of companies.\n\nI've worked at 4 companies since graduating, 2 more if you count my internships, and I'd only describe one of them as turning toxic. That one was *great* to work for for about 2 years, but they had a CTO change who slowly tried to turn up the heat on the devs, which resulted in me and most of the good devs jumping ship before it got really bad. The other 5 companies though? Great WLB/cultures. I left one because I wanted to move to the east coast (100% onsite days), some of my friends are *still there* 12 years into their career. I left another one cause I was sick of the industry it was in, but honestly this was probably a mistake. The 3rd was the one I said turned toxic after 2 years. The one I'm at now is still smooth sailing over a year in.\n\nGood companies are out there. You just have to find them.",

That doesn't mean you're \"blacklisted\", that means you've been rejected/ghosted. *Worst* case I'd imagine from that is a 6 month cooldown.\n\nBlacklists are generally for people that do something grossly unprofessional. Something so blatant in the company's eyes that they'd refuse to hire you even if you were the smartest person on Earth.\n\nHaving scheduling conflicts, doing an interview with bad enough internet that you can't finish it, aren't *good* things. But they're not so terrible that the company would refuse to ever work with you if you performed well in an interview.\n\nChill out, wait 6 months, and re-apply.\n\nI have an anecdote from my last job search in 2024. I was in talks with a company that I didn't really care about, and they had a really bad reputation for WLB. I just appplied because why not. Well, they sent me an OA to do and I just.... didn't. I didn't respond to the recruiter, I didn't decline/submit the OA, I just... ghosted them. The recruiter kept reaching out to me, warning me of the deadline, offering an extended deadline, etc... and I just, didn't respond. Shitty of me? Sure, ghosting sucks in either direction. But it was what it was, I didn't have the energy to respond to them, I was in talks with other companies I actually cared about.\n\nWell, that exact same company reached out to me again to interview with them no less than 3 months later. And they've continued to reach out to me (not just one recruiter, but several) non-stop ever since then. Every few months I'll see a few emails from a few recruiters about open roles.\n\nI ghosted them. That's shittier than what you did. And I'm still not on their blacklist.\n\nYou're fine.",

So does your team actually need to produce a replacement? You say you're doing code reviews but how is that possible without requirements and a development plan?\n2. you say the team is oversized yet still drowning? Unless they're all completely useless that doesn't make much sense.\n\nThose inconsistencies aside, it seems clear why the lead position was open. Either the previous lead was incompetent and built the wrong team for the task, or they were setup for failure and that happened. Or they left on their own after either creating or being put in a failing situation. The cause doesn't really matter here, the vacancy is just a strong hint that this team is dysfunctional. \n\n I would start by having a 1:1 with your immediate boss (senior lead? director?) and be totally upfront about the issues. DO NOT SUGAR COAT ANYTHING. Tell them that you don't believe this is the right team for this project and need to rebuild.  Say \"The staffing on the team is not appropriate for the project.\" or something like that.\n\nIf your boss doesn't agree, then you have another data point on where the incompetence is that caused this mess. Schedule a 1:1 with your skip and repeat.\n\nThe key here is to be direct and back it all up with as much evidence as you can. I assume that you have had 1:1s with your new reports so you have some direct knowledge. Pull all their commits and review them. See if they're that bad or just complacent under the previous lead.\n\nGet your lead or your skip on board and then have HR start the separation process for all the dead weight engineers on your team. If you rebuild an effective and more efficient team and actually ship this project then you'll in a great position. If it goes south, then I don't think that just sitting around hoping for it to get better would have worked either.",

There are also levels beyond staff (senior staff, principal, distinguished, fellow).\n\nThere's different leveling structures across the industry like Amazon's SDE1/2/3 and Microsoft's 59-80, and there's companies with different title progressions (e.g. again Amazon, where there's no \"staff\", or IBM, where \"staff\" means mid level and comes before senior), so talking in terms of \"L5\" just makes it easier to talk about level equivalency across companies.\n\nEach level has rubrics for both hiring and promotions, largely based on amount of scope/impact, and these rubrics are similar across different companies for the respective levels.",

The reason why a lot of new grad roles start very (typically between 2-4) is that anything under might be an intern role or a role at the company that is just lower. And for which level you interview for, it depends on your previous experience. Assume L5 is senior, if you apply to this role most companies will assume you have been senior or you have showcased senior capabilities already. Some companies will up level you or down level you depending on their definition of the level. For example meta e3 is new grad and you actually can‚Äôt have experience (I think you need less than 1) , so above that you can be E4, if you have the experience you might be E5, if you have 3 yoe but you experience aligns highly with what they want and you perform well in interviews they might up level you to E5 (rare).\n\nAlso L6 is not necessarily best engineer or something. You can move up your career just having a lot of luck too (probably still a good worker). I know someone at my company who went from L3 equivalent to L6 equivalent in 1 year (internal job change, pm).\n\nYou move up by showing that you have already been performing at that level. Sometimes you can‚Äôt move up though due to budget and other office politic reasons.",

Spending extra mental energy on interviews makes it more likely you do poorly at your current job. I promise if you try your best and still get pipped, the pip runway is long enough for you to prepare at that point. It‚Äôs like months of time. So for now, just try your best and document your findings. You can even spin it as how to help other new onboarders by detailing what was hard to learn in your team‚Äôs system, missing docs or metrics, etc. Good luck!",

I had been working at a sort of low grade data engineering job for a few years out of school, bc I had moved to a smaller town with my ex, but those didn‚Äôt amount to anything in my new job. I spent probably the first year there feeling like I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing. Because I truthfully didn‚Äôt.\n\nBut they hired me knowing what I knew, they liked me personally and believed I would figure it out. After a year or so I felt comfortable with HOW to ask questions, which is a HUGE thing. And to do that, I had to work on things to understand why I was doing them. That‚Äôs very much how I learn, and I think many engineers find a level of enjoyment from the field, and that‚Äôs what a lot of teams look for. It‚Äôs worth it for a company to invest in someone who will learn to do things the right way.\n\nRelated: The code base was a mess, as it turns out, and direction was directionless as this newly minted unicorn startup ramped up hiring.  So a few months after I felt confident they fired half the engineers and the other half 6 months later. This was a week before moving to New York. \n\nI spent 3 months applying to jobs and interviewing and practicing questions from my new apartment for no joke, 12 hours a day. I went out after that and enjoyed my new home. I got hired at my current company 3 years ago and found they had the same approach to letting us learn and tinker with things. Now I should be on track for senior this year and I know I‚Äôm a good developer in my own eyes and get the sort of work that reflects it. \n\nJust get in and get your hands dirty and learn to enjoy it, they spent a lot to hire you and if you‚Äôre asking questions and showing your thoughts to them, they will do their best to get you there. But really think about the content of your questions. Identify exactly the last thing you did before you got stuck, recall the steps. Reboot your computer and try again, clear the local cache (check your policies for this first lol), present it like it‚Äôs a problem/hypothesis/method like a science doc and let them fill in the conclusions. It‚Äôs their job, and they will only be bothered heavily if you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúidk what to do‚Äù",

I was labeled a \"temp worker\" with no benefits or PTO, yet I was given consistent a 40 hour schedule each week, with no expected end date. And was doing work that was definitely worth far more than what I was being paid.\n\nAll I had when hired was a CS degree, good GPA, tutoring experience, and some data related projects. (machine learning based, but was a good example of data handling as well)\n\nI just kept taking on more challenges because they didn't have others who could do it. my suggestion is to aim for old \"fossil\" type non-tech companies. they are trying to modernize so they want people with these skills, but they don't pay super well, and wont have any mentors for you. They will like people who can independently teach themselves how to work with new systems.

In vscode you can command click the stack trace lines in the terminal to go to that part of the code. Usually you can just click the line that is right before an external library call. But, you can also click into external library code stack lines and even edit it if you want to add print statements there.\n\nA few of the tough errors I see people get stuck on are circular imports. But, it's not hard to break those.\n\nA lot of people say to use debuggers.

Your friend is absolutely correct:\n\n>it‚Äôs less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communication\n\nI go back and forth whether it's \"real programming\" or not. You're not technically building anything from the ground up, but instead are modifying or adding onto an existing application. However, that can be said for some legacy systems, too. The language isn't not hard to pick up at all and I feel like you can definitely tackle some interesting technical questions/problems. So, maybe you can think of it as programming at a very high (abstracted) level.\n\nAs for your questions:\n\n1. **Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?** I have always valued my .NET background because I understand what is going on \"under the hood.\" I've run into some interesting issues over the years and knowing how the framework works has really helped in getting to the root cause of the issue. I've also talked to a few managers at different companies and they have said it's nice to have someone with a non-Dynamics background.\n2. **What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?** If you already have a good handle on understanding business requirements and communication, it would be beneficial to take a look at the development ecosystem so you see what you're getting into from a technical perspective. I can only speak for Business Central, but the MS documentation site has a ton of information, including some tutorials: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al)\n3. **Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?** I feel like there is an uptick in the market, but I don't have any data to support that. As a customer, it's easier than ever to get started and the product does offer a lot. \n\nIf you're kind of over the grind of traditional \"programming\" and want a little more interaction with customers, then it sounds like it would be a good change for you. \n\nOne really nice thing is that the language has been going through quite the overhaul the last decade and MS is really working to improve the developer experience. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than when I started. \n\nI will say the only issue I'm running into is I've just about hit the upper limit of the pay scale -- the last offer I received was for the same salary with just a bonus added on. Because of that, I'm looking to make the opposite move and go into a more traditional developer role. \n\nI hope that covers all of your questions! If not, feel free to ask more!",

This project is at a level of 3rd year undergrad student, but definitely not at a 9 YOE level.\n\nIf you're absolutely adamant about looking for a new job now, your best bet is not to bring up this project at all. Focus on your experience, and try to make that sound cool (9 years is hella impressive!). At that point, interviewers rarely care about personal projects. You'll have to learn about how best to present yourself, though.\n\nHowever, if you're not in a rush to find a new position, I'd recommend that you upskill. Try to think about as many interesting and complex features as possible that can be added to your project. The more complex it sounds, the more you'll learn from it. At the very least, learn some basic AI/LLM stuff and add it to your project. Also, your UI looks kinda bad. I get it that you're not a frontend person, but you can just use ChatGPT or whatever LLM of your choice to generate a beautiful UI for you. The first impression anyone gets about your website is from how it looks, so don't make them prejudiced against it by making it look bad.\n\nAs for the freelance - no idea, honestly, don't have any experience with that. However, that would also really depend on your sales skills, so evaluate those first.\n\nAnyways, good luck to you and all the best!",

I've worked with multiple data scientists in industry with degrees in physics.\n\nMost all hiring managers and any decent recruiter will not find anything amiss with the credentials and background.\n\n**To answer your questions directly**: (1) you don't need to express the value of your experience in a particularly special way, (2) most certifications won't help much but could help to convince people you're more ready to go in certain aspects (see below), and (3) most people aren't really looking for portfolios. Internship and job experience trump other factors.\n\nAnyway, through your resume and in interviews you will need to convince people that\n\n1. You have extensive practical and theoretical knowledge of very basic DS concepts like gradient descent, regularization, data cleaning, A/B testing, etc.\n2. You have some practical and theoretical knowledge of whatever technique or domain area their team specializes in. Maybe it's computer vision or recommendation systems or something else like that. This used to generally not be as much expected for entry level but with today's market the expectations are higher.\n3. You have foundational technical/business skills, depending on the kinds of work the team delivers. A team writing production code for algorithms will want somebody familiar with using git and coding in a team environment, for example.\n\nMost people will assume you have the capacity to meet all the criteria but will want to test if you're already at (or close to) a level where you can contribute without too much fuss.\n\nIt definitely doesn't help at all that the expectations and responsibilities for data scientists vary widely across companies and teams.",

When you're in interviews, frame your research as what it really was: advanced data analysis and modeling work. Talk about the scale of data you worked with, the computational challenges you solved, and how you validated your models. That's pure data science experience, just in a different domain.\n\nSkip the certifications and focus your energy on translating your existing projects into a portfolio that speaks the business language. Take that neural network simulation and present it as a machine learning project - discuss the algorithms you implemented, the performance metrics you used, and the insights you generated. Create a GitHub repository with clean, well-documented code and write up your projects with clear explanations of your methodology and results. Your PhD work is far more impressive than any online certificate, but you need to present it in terms that hiring managers can immediately understand.

Your instinct to prioritize algorithms practice is spot on. Google has a very standardized interview process where they want to see your problem-solving approach, coding skills, and ability to optimize solutions rather than test your memorization of computer science theory. Save the CS fundamentals review for other companies that explicitly test those areas.\n\nThat said, having solid fundamentals knowledge never hurts and can sometimes help you think through algorithmic problems more effectively, but it shouldn't be your focus right now. Google interviewers are trained to evaluate candidates on coding ability, communication, and technical reasoning within the context of algorithmic challenges. Spend your remaining prep time getting comfortable with medium-difficulty problems, practicing coding on a whiteboard or shared document, and being able to clearly explain your thought process. If you find yourself struggling with unexpected questions during the actual interview, [interview assistant AI](http://interviews.chat) can help you navigate those tricky moments - I'm on the team that built it as a tool to help candidates handle challenging interview situations in real-time.",

Trivia can wait until later since other companies are more likely to throw those curveballs.\n\nWhen I was prepping I also did mock interviews on Pramp. Then during the interviews I used a tool called StealthCoder. It overlays tailored hints, solutions and even high level designs in real time so I could explain solutions clearly. That made it easier to stay calm and sound structured when the pressure was on. I'd check it out because I owe it to that tool that I landed my current software engineering role.\n\nSo I‚Äôd say focus on algorithms for now, make sure you can communicate your approach step by step, and keep the fundamentals on the back burner until you have more time.",
