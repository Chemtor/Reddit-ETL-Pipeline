He was an MBA who got dumped on the data team because he was the CFO's buddy who had fucked up one too many times on the finance team.\n\nThings he did while managing the small data team:\n\n1. Set up the initial infrastructure as a single prod database that read directly in from sources. No stage, no transformation layer, just source straight into prod. No backups either, and he thought backups were an extra expense we didn't need.\n2. Stored patient phone numbers and zip codes as numbers, dropping all leading zeroes for about four months' data until he put that into a reporting table and freaked out about why so many rows were wrong.\n3. After fixing the phone number issue, he decided to use phone numbers as a patient table's primary key, \n4. This is my all-time favorite: he put unhashed SSNs in a table that was fed into Tableau, so that all of our practice administrators could see the SSNs of all the patients across all of our practices. *Huge* security issue.\n5. Lied about a dozen times on a questionnaire about security practices for a data sharing deal the company wanted to do with BCBS. We were incredibly lucky that our privacy officer caught that on the way out and corrected things, although she ended up being the one who took the heat when BCBS said \"Oh *hell* no\" to the deal after seeing how sketchy things were.",

The second is about making more complex projects without losing quality of the solution.\n\nIf you can do both, it doesn't matter if you use LLMs or not.

Understanding the structure is th le best thing you can do.\n\nThen python.

The challenge is the enforcement of that governance.\n\nWithout a Semantic Layer: Governance is a series of documents, meetings, and wiki pages. An analyst has to remember to `SUM(revenue) - SUM(refunds)` to get `net_revenue` and to filter out test user accounts. It's manual and prone to error.\n\nWith a semantic layer (LookML in this case): You define these rules in code. You define `net_revenue` once.\n\n\n    measure: net_revenue {\n      type: sum\n      sql: ${TABLE}.revenue - ${TABLE}.refunds ;;\n      value_format_name: usd_0\n      description: \"Total revenue after refunds have been deducted.\"\n    }\n    \nNow, the business user doesn't need to remember the formula. They just see a field in the UI called \"Net Revenue.\" They can't calculate it incorrectly because the logic is baked in. \n\nFor ad-hoc stuff and reports that are ephemeral - semlayers slow things down.

If your company has a more complex model with multiple subjects that interact with one another then you might want to look at one just for usability let alone governance.  I work in a telecomish company and our business model is a star schema with subjects for subscribers, service revenue, device revenue and some other things.  The semantic model holds all the information for the dimension joins and deals with  the conformity (users like to try to join fact tables for some reason) and allows for calculations across tables like service revenue per subscriber or total revenue from service and device sales.  Those calculations are objects in the model that the user just drags into their visual, so it's easy and ensures consistency.\n\nOutside of my little example, they are good for maintaining consistency across consuming applications.  So like my BI and Data science people are aligned and even simple consumption in Excel if the semantic tool has integrations with those.  Also really good when you work in a bigger company where they own all the tools and you want \"one source of the truth\" from your semantic model.",

On the one hand, if you actually manage to create some kind of long-shot digital transformation and data driven success story, that'd be pretty strong for you... OTOH yeah I think the odds of that succeeding are 0.01% given the factors you describe + your own lack of commitment to actually turning things around (you make it sound hopeless, which makes me think you yourself lack the grit to make a successful pivot happen).\n\nIf you want to stick around and try, you'll probably need to suck it up and pay out of pocket for some cloud subscriptions, buy your own Mac laptop, etc. The silver lining thing about a company with bad IT practices is -- you have the freedom to just go rogue, and \"probably\" no one will stop you if you intentionally build out your own shadow IT environment. Go sign up for a free Snowflake account ($400 in free credits), go hook it up with your own GitHub, and load up data from SharePoint by just downloading CSV files to your laptop... Yeah that would be all terrible and not best practices, but in this situation, it gives you autonomy and frees you from being blocked by IT. Then, with your rogue shadow IT environment, go BUILD something useful and amazing and revolutionary... You're trying to foment a rebellion here, but for your vision to win, you have to actually demonstrate something meaningfully different and revolutionary that COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED in their legacy stack -- if all you do is say, \"look guys I put our code into git, see this is better now\", then no one will give a shit because that by itself doesn't matter, doesn't change the business. \n\nBut I don't think you are going to be able to pull it off.

Identify pain points and opportunities to improve top or bottom line. Formulate these into business use cases. You don‚Äôt need MBA to learn how to do this. Quantify impact and tie to dollars when possible. Prioritize use cases by impact and complexity. Complexity is not just technical, may include availability or interest of business stakeholders required. Look for quick win(s), ideally that you could knock out yourself assuming you have no team. Get business leadership onboard and have them instruct IT to give you the access and tools you need. This is the way. Hopefully you successfully execute some small quick wins (e.g. an exec dashboard the CEO wishes he/she had) and can make the case for additional investment (e.g., team members) to tackle larger and larger use cases.",

They don't want people just complaining about problems. It's about coming to them with solutions.\n\nI've had multiple jobs where after a couple months of seeing dysfunction, I'll schedule a meeting with the CEO and have a frank conversation. If you can clearly present the problems, the financial impact, and propose solutions, you will either get respect and have opportunities open up, or be shut down. That's your sign as to whether you stay or go.\n\nFor your situation, if you're able to find a way to overall the org, it will look great on your resume.

Moose as an \"ORM\" is one approach (I know of at least one smallish company using it, they seem happy)\n\nWe've done something \"similar\" at Tinybird (similar in the sense that it's a CH abstraction designed to make it easier to integrate into the application), but our approach is more API-centric. Basically make it dead simple to turn a SQL query into an API, and then integration really becomes a question of how you handle your API routes in your backend code and doesn't really require you to \"think\" about the database.\n\nI'm genuinely curious to know how people would compare Moose vs. Tinybird - do people like the ORM approach?

That gets messy if you're trying to hit a 15-min SLA with high reliability and source API quirks.\n\nHave you considered using a streaming CDC layer like Debezium or a change-data tool in front of the warehouse, and doing light pre-processing (like hashing) inline before landing to Snowflake? Or using something like Estuary, which can do incremental syncs, apply hashing inline before data hits the destination, and supports low-latency replication with built-in schema drift handling. Bonus is no maintaining connectors or DAGs.\n\nQuick q's: How often do schemas actually change in Salesforce for you? And are the PII fields always in fixed locations or could they appear in custom fields too?\n\nI work at Estuary, so naturally I'm biased, but it's built exactly for this kind of setup where off-the-shelf tools either fall short on compliance or require too much engineering lift.

Fivetran offers various plans. We use the 'standard' plan and it provides for a 15min sync time.  Any lower than that you you need the 'enterprise' plan (I think).\n\nFivetran will not directly help with building SCD Type 2.  However, you can do a couple things here:  1) you can have it run in history mode, in which case it will not update in place rows that have changed. It will create new versioned rows as needed.  2) you can let Fivetran update rows in place but then use Snowflake STREAMS to detect the changes and then use that to drive any sort of SCD Type 2 dimensional needs (with whatever etl tool you have).\n\nFivetran also supports Schema Drift (for SFDC and other connectors).  You can control it so that FT will add new columns but not new tables (unless you want that).  It also handles cases where column datatypes change (although that can still break downstream etl).\n\n  \nFivetran or Airbyte the best pick for this? \n\n\\>>> I see no reason why Fivetran would not work for your needs but you need the budget.  For SFDC replication, budget for $800 USD per month (depending on what objects you need). Hubspot maybe less per month.\n\n* Have you dealt with PII masking before landing data in a warehouse? How did you handle it?  Fivetran handles this OOTB.\n* Any experience building or managing SCD Type 2?

If using dbt, then use its testing.  Otherwise, consider Soda, or build my own.  Building my own tends to work very well - since it's easy to create a python program that simply runs queries stored as files in a directory, with jinja2 templating.  And this supports generic checks like nulls, min/max values, empty strings, case, etc as well as custom checks for specific business rules.\n   * Add reconciliation checks to the Quality-Control framework.\n   * Create some kind of data dictionary or catalog to help users understand the data.",

That covers the logic bit for known inputs.\n\nBut the big problem is when the inputs shift without announcing themselves. This isn‚Äôt something you can expect to catch with CI because it happens outside of the version control cycle. The only answers I‚Äôm really aware of here are runtime validations (we have various checks on every write (non-null assertions, no empty partitions, etc), and monitoring (usually volumes/reasonable deltas over some period of time). If you‚Äôre really fancy you can build a model for outlier detection that wouldn‚Äôt show in volume alone.\n\nSometimes the data can shift in really unpredictable ways and cause failures. So if you have data whose cardinality you don‚Äôt control, this will always be a risk. Just last week I burned hours troubleshooting sudden failures due to viral user behavior skewing logs to an insane degree. If your data can skew, make sure you have proactive measures in place to prevent it from becoming an issue (salting before joins in spark, etc).",

This isn't always possible, but I run into a ton of teams that think that as long as a job is batch performance doesn't matter.  They're not thinking about cost, usability benefits of lower latency, or deployment/fix implications of their slow batch jobs.\n   * Missing bells & whistles: simple logging & alerting is fairly easy to address, monitoring can be more, but also driven off logging, etc, etc.\n\nSo, if I ran into a team that wanted to show results fast, this is what they knew, and wanted to defer for a bit trying to figure out best way to run jobs, I wouldn't be too concerned about this approach.",

I've had LLMs completely make up configs before. \n\nFind something to do that nobody wants to do or has the time to do. This will build your knowledge in your domain and help to push the envelope.

I came from a marketing background then became a Data Analyst then a Data Engineer. It's not easy to be a DE. Most of my Data Analyst friends stay Data Analysts. But their careers are different from mine. They do have fancier job titles after a few years like something something Senior Manager, whatever that means. So if you want to get the Manager title quickly and like meetings and dealing with people you can go to the BI route. Otherwise, DE. I don't know about earning potential. You can't pay me enough to make me want to attend meetings. \n\n[Edit] I also want to add it depends on where you live. BI jobs exist in large metropolitan cities. I'm in Australia so you do have to live in Sydney or Melbourne. Whereas DE jobs can be found in smaller cities or remote jobs. I live in Brisbane. It's mostly a market for DE.

You can never trully know if a sql query is correct because it relies on the database schema structure and the data in the db. SQL code cannot be compiled to ensure correctness. The best thing it can ever do is catching mistakes like missing comma's, never this column doesnt exists.\n\ndbt makes it much better that it relies on .sql files instead of database metadata. So you can do a lot more. But dbt tests are also run after the transformation. If you do dq checks with dbt, yeah but those records are still present in the prod db if you don't have setup a temp final table before prod.",

It's constant learning, even as an experienced engineer, whenever I switched to a new stack, I needed between one and two years to be proficient at the local stack and the local software. Good engineering managers know that and will mostly expect you to demonstrate that you are proactively learning by asking questions and reaching out to seniors to get help.\n\nIf you're good at SQL and have some experience with proper software engineering (git), dbt should be easy for you to pick up in a couple of weeks. Just follow their guides and best practices to make sure you use it correctly and in a way that is easy to follow by another dbt user.  \nSnowflake is probably the best hands-off OLAP distributed database, if you're good at SQL, there should be no difficulty. As with any data processing tool, the key is to focus on their documentation about optimizing query performance (partitioning, clustering...).\n\nSo, the learning is not going to be a problem, I think the hardest is going to be passing the selection in the current market.",

Usually you know what you are trying to achieve with a policy, so you can just go through the docs and find the right arguments. \n\n* Do you typically modify existing templates that your company has already created?\n\nSometimes. Sometimes it's from scratch-ish if I'm setting up something that doesn't already exist. \n\n* Or is this task often handled by a dedicated DevOps, Cloud, or Security team, especially in larger companies?\n\nI don't know about larger companies, and even then I expect it would depend on the company. In the companies I've worked at (startups / medium) the data team had their own AWS sub-account where we could implement whatever tools/policies we wanted - the official devops folks were focused on production architecture. We definitely worked with them and did some security reviews tho. \n\n\\> Should I dive deep into the IAM JSON policy syntax, or is it more important to have a strong conceptual understanding of what permissions are needed for a pipeline, and then learn to adapt existing policies?\n\nDon't bother learning the syntax unless that's going to be 90% of your workload. Copy paste is going to be your friend, and then you can adapt as needed. Keep in mind the principle of least privilege and you'll be fine - you always start from zero and only add access to what you need. But what you need is gonna depend on what you're trying to do (read? write? etc.) Architecture is much harder than the syntax piece.",

But the majority of all that configuration/security stuff is handled by the other more senior Dev at my company who initially set up the AWS stuff.  In my case its more like, \"Hey I'm trying to deploy this lambda that needs to access an S3 bucket but its blocking the access for the functions IAM role\".  He then jumps on and configures whatever access my user account needs to be able to access.  But then I still need to figure out how to write the Infrastructure correctly in the cloudformation template to tie everything together when I deploy it.\n\nIts literally just me and him though who are developers and we are just getting our feet wet with AWS at our company.  So our infrastructure is not very complex and still not too tied into the AWS ecosystem.  So the policies are quite basic.",

Our vision is for ingestion / connectors to work from any scheduler of your choice, be it Airflow, Argo, Dagster or even a github workflow. If you are running using metadata cli thats fine too.\n\nWe ship airflow as default because many organizations uses it already and established scheduler that we found many of our users.  If you don‚Äôt want to use it or run one by yourself or use APIs or another scheduler all are intended by our architecture and design of the platform.\n\nif you have any further questions do reach out to us at [https://slack.open-metadata.org](https://slack.open-metadata.org)",

Problem (problem for OpenMetadata ingestion) is that Cosmos will parse dbt project, and for each model creates separate task, which helps a lot of granularity, parallelism, and easier to maintain, and its simply how it should be done on Airflow. But it also generates 'run\\_results.json' for each of the models separately in temporary directory. Now we can always use callback to move it to any place we would like, but then we have run\\_results.json for each of the models.\n\n  \nDo i simply have one last step to merge all of the run\\_results.json files or there is an alternative strategy?",

It should bring back chunks semantically related to health checks. From the metadata of these chunks, you can get what tools are bound to be useful for this task. Notice I didn't mention the LLM yet, we'll circle back to it later.\n\nOk, so you have a few chunks from man pages and pointers to various tools. Passing all the man pages may be too much, so, what to do? One option is pre-generating one summary per tool, including things like required arguments, and sending it along with the chunks you found. That's a middle term between option A and B.\n\nNow going back to the LLM call in step one. Why do you need that? You need it to generate good questions, not good answers. The vector store will bring you the answers, but if you only send the last line the user types, it can be something like \"What flags can I use to format the output?\" It's lacking content. The LLM is there to read this, along with all the conversation, and turn it into something like, \"What tool do I use to run health checks, and what flags can I use to format its output?\" That has a much higher chance to bring the chunks you need. It doesn't need to know your tools, only how to formulate a good question to surface those chunks from the vector DB.",

That‚Äôs just about throughput.\n\nBut if you‚Äôre going straight at production CRMs or ERPs databases, that‚Äôs where it gets delicate. A sloppy WHERE date > last_refresh_date on a huge table can be a full scan, lock things up, and suddenly, the app is crawling. You do that once.

They can balloon, not every system handles them cleanly, and if you‚Äôre unlucky, you get stuck pulling GBs of changes that still slow down the source.

You know that if they all have a date field you can load Jan 1st. Then if you look at the max date you‚Äôve loaded you‚Äôll see Jan first so you can easily load some date after.\n\nIf your data is completed, using a sequential number will always be best. It‚Äôs also usually easier to order your data based on those sequential fields which makes query sample of data faster to select.\n\nIf your data is not technically completed. (You are receiving transactions through the day but you want them aggregated even if the day is not yet completed) you usually are better creating a timestamps field and loading new data based on that field. Again same technique you know what you loaded last to you load everything new and store the max timestamp of the data you‚Äôve loaded",

I'm probably not following what this subreddit would consider to be best practices, but here's what I did:\n\n* Built out a Python ETL platform that allows me to generate pipelines using JSON config files. The pipelines ingest Excel files directly from our local network, transform and clean the data, and pop it into an on-prem SQL Server database. My platform is modular and extensible, so I tend to add/update functionality as needed.\n* I use dev/test/prod environments in the DB but haven't done bronze/silver/gold layers. Monitoring is manual right now (log files!) but I plan to migrate to Prefect and/or implement some Power BI dashboards that consume my logs.\n* I avoid manually-managed documentation wherever possible, because that will be the first thing to go out of date. Instead, I'm using JSON schemas and GitHub Actions to automatically generate documentation for my config files on push, and docstrings + pdoc + GitHub Actions to do the same for my codebase. Only manually-maintained documentation is the top-level README for the repo.\n* Power BI is a star for me. Getting the on-prem gateway running was painful, but I've established dev/test/prod environments where I control access. Users can access the dashboards via Teams or, in some cases, export the semantic models to Excel for further analysis. I'm also using PBIB files so I can manage dev in GitHub.\n\nIn terms of general approach, I would start slow and be responsive. Full-stack data analysis means you're also your own PM, so be sure to communicate well and be able to justify your choices to stakeholders. Figure out your P0 items that are crucial for what you're building and then go build it. As you work on this, you'll naturally identify new concerns and priorities and be able to respond to those. Having a vision for what you want to do will help you build for the future--for example, I want to manage my configs via a website, so I established JSON schema rules that unlocked automated documentation--but your vision should remain flexible.\n\nGood luck!\n\n(Edit: Formatting)",

Direct being key. That should answer your question regarding Google.\n\nIf your job is specifically within the software for a sales team I would argue you as revenue. They couldn‚Äôt do their sales jobs as good without you \n\n2 is a hard distinction, almost all cost centers support the revenue business in some way as all companies exist to make money. You wouldn‚Äôt have them in the first place if they contributed nothing. I think the way to look at is do you fully support the revenue cycle or do you support everyone. IT desk support can have higher overall job security even being a cost center because a business cannot afford to fire all of them \n\n3, it depends on how much of your time is spent on the chargeable service. Sometimes you can think of it this way. If the business fires your whole team would there be a way they could continue to survive without you be it outsourcing, praying, etc. that question may cause more questions because certain sales guys could be fired in that context. And guess what, sales guys do get fired in hard times, but the top/critical sales guys usually are not. Once a company intentionally negatively impacts revenue they enter a tailspin and they have a finite amount of time to correct\n\n5 I can answer this directly. Yes.

You‚Äôre absolutely right that the real picture is far more nuanced, and many essential teams are cost centres- accounts, IT, facilities, and usually. the executives themselves. If your work has no price tag, it has no value in MBA math. \n\nTo reiterate, essential things are still costs. Buildings, utilities, salaries, so on. But the business will generally look to keep costs low.to use your example, the IT department is like rent- it‚Äôs an unavoidable necessity. \n\nThe trick as a cost center is to make sure your work gets properly credited to you, often through internal billing, sometimes via other KPIs and metrics.

Jeff has to be paid a salary and the accounting line for that gets assigned to a cost center. Jeff probably isn‚Äôt a product, though I guess you can stretch this to say it‚Äôs possible when talking about a person who is a model, or stripper, or something like that haha. Then they are what‚Äôs being sold. But so long as Jeff is something like a sales manager a logistics director, he‚Äôs not the product. It‚Äôs not that he doesn‚Äôt matter, but on the books, he doesn‚Äôt get to directly be tagged like a product. Now, his work is more directly involved in transactions that do get tagged with profit centers, though, than someone who is, say, in human resources. \n\nTransactions for inventory changes of physical consumer goods often end up getting tagged to both a profit center and a cost center. The profit center is just related to what the good is. But the cost center is usually location based. Factory A and Factory B are different cost centers. This becomes important because other costs are posted to each factory and can differ, like labor costs and electricity and rent.

ClickHouse community is strong and growing. The number of contributors and commits to ClickHouse has grown so much over the last 5-10 years. Just look at the contrib chart: [https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors)  \n  \nPinot not so much: [https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors)  \n  \nIf your main concern is maintenance and operational overhead, to me this is the most important thing. I think the ClickHouse community takes the cake.\n\nPersonally I also think that CH is just easier to reason about. The SQL is mostly standard with some CH-specific stuff, but if you know SQL you can be productive quickly. For logs specifically, it handles high-volume ingestion really well and the compression is excellent.\n\nI don't have as much hands-on experience with Pinot, but from what I understand it can be more complex operationally - more moving pieces to manage. The trade-off is that it's designed more specifically for certain real-time analytics workloads.\n\nSince you mentioned you're starting with logs and might move to business metrics later, CH might be the safer bet. It's proven at massive scale (we have customers running trillions of rows) and the operational complexity is manageable. Plus if you're planning to eventually query business metrics alongside logs, having everything in one system can simplify things.\n\nWhat kind of log volumes are you looking at? And do you need real-time ingestion or is near real-time ok?\n\nBtw, maybe you'll find this template interesting or useful as a starting point -> [https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template](https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template) (if you're worried about operational overhead, maybe Tinybird could be a landing place for you... lmk if you have questions about it.",

The entire purpose behind RDBMS like Postgres is that it gives you these commands to operate on data locally with all the tooling to make it as efficient as possible because it understands the source and destination table structures.\n\nMerge statements would be very generic. You could make a pretty simple jinja template to use as a code generator, just putting the target table name and column names as params. Make that output a procedure definition, and as long as you stick to the pattern that's all you have to write manually. You should be able to automatically scrape all the parameters you need using information_schema -- the whole thing could be a single python script to automatically generate everything.\n\nYou have your spark insert to a staging table (truncate first if you don't include a partition column), then run the procedure.\n\nIf they don't want to deal with all of these objects too much, they can have a separate schema to put them in.\n\nUltimately making spark do the work if figuring out what is an insert, update, or delete, is going to be very wasteful in shuffling data back-and-forth, and you're running two sets of compute when it could be one.",

Do the upsert from staging to target, then truncate the staging.\n\nI think this would be a fairly quick way of doing what you are looking for.

In production it's even scarier as companies often refer to business concepts with different descriptions (hell, I don't even understand the ask sometimes because their description is so bad).  Then the feedback they get is often the SQL itself, which is gibberish to most people so they can't validate that the LLM got it right.

Also worth checking out tools like Waii or Text2SQL.ai that specialize in this problem.\n\nThe real issue is that business users describe things completely differently than how the data is actually structured.

You almost need a translation layer between business language and actual schema.\n\nHave you tried fine tuning a model on your specific schema with lots of query examples?

Different orgs refer to people and roles slightly differently, absent protections for certain professional titles (e.g. Engineer).\n\nIf you want to say that it takes a programmer (or coder, or software engineer, or developer...) to be able to evaluate the output of LLMs in a particular context in order for LLMs to be useful for building complex software, just say that. There's no need to start splitting hairs over terminology.

It might be interesting to use for reviewing code, but I really don't understand the mindset of those who think it's anywhere near able to replace anyone in this industry.\n\nPeople are turning to AI to solve problems that can and should be solved by actual deterministic, properly thought, and battle-tested frameworks instead, and I think this is wrong in many ways, because at the end of the day it's not deterministic so the same prompt is totally unlikely to generate the same code twice, unless you run the model locally and always provide it with the same seed and prompt sequence, but most people don't even do that. Not only that but as of now AI doesn't even come close to a proficient programmer at any meaningful task as the AI generated code that I've read so far suffered from being extremely verbose, lacking proper structure, and containing lots of useless comments, which considering that we have already been suffering from a huge code quality problem due to businesses making it normal to focus on developer experience instead of user experience for decades, means nothing good for this industry.\n\nPeople using AI to take on tasks that they are not versed in are also hurting themselves, not only by letting it produce potentially crap code whose correctness they can't really verify, but because by letting the AI do it, they are also missing out on potentially insightful learning opportunities. AI might be able to generate lots of code very fast, giving people the impression that they are actually saving time, while in reality the brittle nature of that code couple with nobody really having a deep understanding of the train of thought behind it means that technical debt is accumulating very quickly, leading to whole projects having to be scrapped and rewritten from scratch once the codebase becomes unmanageable.\n\nWe might also already be witnessing the dawn of a new job title that I would call AI janitor, where some companies vibe code their way to success, the resulting mess becomes totally unmanageable, and they end up having to hire humans to rewrite everything from scratch. I am actually positioning myself to take on this role at some point in the future, by continuing to learn, keeping my brain sharp, and also taking advantage of AI to learn about AI itself and the use cases where it has already largely surpassed human intelligence and can actually be helpful, because honestly when it comes to this technology, I don't think this is the time to relegate myself to the passenger's seat when I can instead take it up to the next level by becoming a pilot.\n\nAt present, companies are collectively spending 10 times more on AI than they're making back, and that's not to mention our consumption of natural resources, so while it's generating revenue, it requires an insane and totally unsustainable amount of investment to do it. The hope is to eventually come up with a way to build an AGI, but since nobody can really predict the consequences of that, I don't think it's realistic to plan with that scenario in mind, especially when other scenarios like model collapse due to the phenomenon where AI slop in training data makes models significantly more likely to hallucinate are a lot more realistic, so I think it's safe to say that we're collecting betting our future on finding a pegasus unicorn.\n\nLastly, there's also the fact that, at present, AI still lacks human curiosity and drive to try new things, so if most people decide to rely on it, once the investment tap is shut, no new innovation will actually be achieved, including on AI itself, since no new problem-solving paradigms will be attempted as AI is only really able to shuffle combinations of the same old strategies. Therefore in the end AI might replace many jobs in this industry not because it became smarter than us but because we collectively decided to get dumber, and while I don't personally mind this scenario from an economical perspective, because I am positioning myself to not only survive the devastation resulting from the explosion of this hype bubble completely unscathed, but to also thrive by providing a helping hand in the aftermath, I am still concerned about the permanent damage we're doing to the natural resources on our planet which we're still totally dependent on for survival.",

There's still room for mathematicians, writers, researchers, mechanics and map creators, and of course software engineers.\n\nFor people who want to create software, either for money or passion, of course they should learn in-depth knowledge about how software works. But I think it is important for people to realize that the landscape of software development is just as large as any of the other fields I mentioned. Merely understanding code compares to software development as changing a tire compares to being a mechanic, or how being able to calculate compares to being a mathematician. Or even between being able to read (and post on reddit) versus writing a series of fiction books. Creating a fictional world requires a huge amount of skill beyond knowing what the words mean.\n\nFor the last couple of years before AI, there was such a huge demand for software developers that job positions were constantly filled with people who had basically just learned how to read code (and write a simple program at best). Which happened because digital literacy is so low and the demand for programmers was so high. That's good for those people, but I don't think it could have been a stable dynamic into the future.  \nNow that decent coding AIs are available, people simply don't know what the future will look like. The AI doesn't neatly fit in the corporate structures that have been built about working with a massive number of junior developers, so the industry will change. It is hard to know what skills will be desired for software development 5 years from now, so my suggestion is to maybe not chase the money right now, but definitely chase the passion.\n\nBut again, \"learning to code\" itself, I would say that everyone should do that, just to understand the very basics of the dozens of computer chips around you every day. (Even the notion that a person today interacts with up to a 100 different programmable computer chips every day is probably weird to many people. If you include internet servers in the mix, the number shoots up to thousands.) The world is still getting more automated every day, and digital illiteracy will eventually became as limiting as normal illiteracy is today.",

I routinely get a laugh out of the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm `round(random.normalvariate(27, 2))` years old. Is that too old to learn Python?‚Äù questions. Just go for it!\n\nOn AI, I‚Äôve seen a lot of tech hype over the years, but it seems like the right answer is to try what‚Äôs new. LLMs are interesting. Writing serious prose, I dislike pretty much everything I get out of them. But, by having something to react to, I more quickly clarify my own logic and get more done. Code completions are often not great when changing tasks, but they‚Äôre often good at making coordinating edits to match the one I just made. Generating longer code ranges from not all that useful (particularly specialized uses or where I have a clear idea of what I want) to massively productive (using a new to me package or things with a lot of boilerplate/structure like dashboards/web frameworks). It‚Äôs nuanced and not always predictable, so you experiment and build intuition. \n\nProgramming is great outside of work, too. I wrote a Python program to help us name our first child and made it (minimally) web-based to help us name our second. My five year old wanted to learn some Python (she saw it in VS Code while we were working on a short book we had an LLM write with her input), so I sat her in front of a terminal interpreter and had her type simple expressions like math and using string methods. The artwork on our walls is all on the same centerline, because I wrote a function to translate picture frame dimensions and the center of the stretched picture wire to a wall location for the hanging hook. I cant count the number of times I‚Äôve whipped up a personal project that analyzes some data or written some abomination of a regex that reformats something mangled into a structured form.\n\nOne of the amazing things about programming is that failure is frequent and relatively costless. Imagine if you messed up a cooking recipe and could simply edit and reprocess it with no ingredient loss and millisecond cooking time as many times as needed. That‚Äôs why diving in is the right approach. You‚Äôll answer your ‚Äúshould I‚Äù question quickly, and you may love it. The many small wins are really gratifying.",

They might prefer to hole up in their office, but if you ask them to explain something they can typically do it clearly.",

The company next door owned the building, so I went next door to ask the receptionist for a key to the building.  My boss, the engineer phoned them to ask them to give me a key. I asked the receptionist nicely and she went and grabbed a spare for me. When I got back to the office, I got to hear the management telling my boss that the keys were numbered and it simply wasn't possible to give me a key.  As I triumphantly held up the key, my boss told them that their system had failed and hung up. The next week I baked a batch of cookies in the morning and dropped them off for the office next door. \n\nSoft skills makes things smoother. People look out for you and you can sometimes get a small job squeaked through even though everything is booked.\n\nBut you have to remember that everything goes both ways. You have to express your appreciation and bribery when people bend over backwards to help you out. Fresh bread, cookies, a box of live crickets delivered to the office, whatever will spark joy in the person who helped you. Hell, mail them a physical card saying thank you.",

Back when we were starting, you could just have the basic skills with almost no qualifications and stumble into a job. Also, startups aside, there used to be a lot more job security in general at the bigger corporations, but that doesn't seem to be the current climate.\n\nRegarding AI, I'm not saying it's gonna replace us all, but it's certainly causing a kind of mass hysteria/industry transformation/paradigm shift, and I don't know whether that will ultimately be for better or worse, I'm betting on worse. My personal thing is that I got into this career because I love to code and debug, but I never enjoyed all the other stuff, from design to meetings to bureaucracy to operations. Well with AI, the coding aspect is kind of ruined in my opinion, like being a good coder gives you very little edge, and on the job the coding will become more and more prompt engineering stuff which is just whatever, and the job will reduce down to just the other aspects.",

Some people learn when they're a lot older than you are.\n\n2. You're not burnt out; you're trying to make yourself do something for the wrong reasons. Go make a career out of something you enjoy.\n\n3. There are lots and lots of interesting programming resources, but *you* probably won't find them interesting because you don't find programming interesting.\n\nIf you want to keep working at programming, let me suggest that you stop trying to learn to write code for a little while and instead learn about computing. Read up on the history of computing and ways that computing is useful now. If you're interested in games, read about game design and the history of computer games. Sometimes it's easier to become interested in a field when you can see how it's relevant to what you want to do.",

But once you actually get what problem SQL is trying to solve, how to databases generally work, and what are the general things you do with SQL like joins, aggregations, etc. then it becomes much more intuitive.\n\nI highly recommend looking at [https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2025/](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2025/) \\- it goes way more in depth than what any beginner needs but even if you do just the very first lecture and homework that already makes you more competent than most",

This is a 3-case lex, 3-function recursive descent parse, then single-function tree walk situation, if you want a proper solution. I'd expect the first solution to be some awkward/inflexible string splitting which broke the second the input changed slightly. If I had more than 30 mins I'd ask how it could be made more robust, at which point I'd expect a suggestion like mine above. I probably wouldn't make them code it up though. Just knowing tells me what I need to know about them for the purpose of the interview.  If I had to suggest the improvement, I might see if they could work with me to code it up by asking good questions etc, almost pair programming style.\n\nMy advice in these is always to use the interviewer as a resource as much as possible. Lots of people go very quiet and try to mentally brute force, then fail, when they could have asked for more help from me. I don't know what they need help with specifically without them asking. On the job, it's fine to ask colleagues things, so it's generally not frowned upon in interview either, as long as you're not asking for the full solution etc.\n\nEdit: code in thread below.",

As you yourself said, it took half an hour even after you Googled for the C functions you needed.\n\nI suppose the tip is to know you C string functions. \n\nThere is a bunch of ways to solve it.

Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.\n1. Next, implement the base case.\n1. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.\n1. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.\n1. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.\n\n\nThe main thing to know is that recursion is mostly overrated. If your problem involves both 1) a tree structure and 2) back tracking, then it's a good candidate for recursion. Otherwise, if you find yourself asking, \"Why couldn't I just do this with a loop\" then you're right: it's a poor candidate for recursion and you should just use the simpler loop solution.",

But you'd need one stack for the file scanner objects (representing the system's view of the directories you had descended) and another for the data you were building for each directory... and you'd carefully inspect each file object, and push a new file scanner if it was a directory, and carefully handle your end-of-scan issues at each level, popping both stacks... it could get tricky.\n\nNow consider doing it with recursion.  You imagine the functional interface you want ‚Äì let's say, a File, and a DataSoFar.  Consider your base case ‚Äì is the File a simple file, not a directory?  Great, you're done.  Produce your output.  Otherwise you need to recurse ‚Äì okay, it's a directory: update DataSoFar, create a scanner from the File, loop through the scanner and call your function on each of the files.  Boom, done.  The book-keeping and boundary conditions are handled for you by the program stack, and you stick to familiar function calling and error-handling idioms.\n\nThe key leap for me is always that imaginative step: *what's the functional interface I wish I could use to solve one step of this problem?*  Recursion sometimes allows you to achieve that interface with minimal effort and great clarity.",

Suddenly you became a kind of semi-hero in the work space? A kind of defacto tech support and programmer (even if that wasn't your main job!). \n\n------------------------------\n\nThe need was so great that... At that point, there's was pretty much nothing you could ever do to get fired! \n\nLike ya... I was younger at that time, and foolish, so even though I didn't control my emotions at some point and even yelled back at the senior founding partner of our firm, I still didn't get fired! \n\nI kid you not: I even got caught late at night in a rather compromising position with a certain colleague, in which her and I were inappropriately hitting it off... and then... well... hit it off one late night, when wouldn't you know it: that same senior partner came into the office unusually to check something. And kinda freaked, then backed out, and never spoke about it to me! (Ya, if that was today, I would have been long fired multiple times!)\n\n------------------------------\n\nAnyways... \n\nSo, I actually got hired by a pretty well known international law firm as a technical writer, since I had done two entirely separate university degrees: one physics, and one English Literature. \n\nYa, I know: that's a strange and weird combo, but those are my 2 loves in life! Despite the fact that unfortunately I'm not all that good in either of them, lol! \n\nBut the law firm dealt in many aspects related to the sciences and engineering, ranging from patents to immigration of highly talented people, etc... So they needed someone who could read scientific papers, and be semi-decent at writing. (As you can see from the length of this comment, I'm a pretty crazy writer: always constantly writing. Just not anything all that good! But still always writing, and I can type at about 90 to 100 words per minute.) \n\n------------------------------\n\nFinally to get to the point, not only did I do technical writing... \n\nBut if anyone had a problem with their computer in the office, my phone line would light up and ring (if the main tech-guy/admin wasn't there yet in the morning, or was already busy). \n\nAnd then people would approach me to help them automate some tasks. \n\nSo believe it or not, I would actually use C++ (taping into Win32) combined with a program called \"Autohotkey\" to do scripting and automation! \n\nLike who uses C++ of all things, to do quick scripting and automation tasks!? Well apparently that would be me! \n\n------------------------------\n\nBut ya, I got the job after I graduated with my second degree, and boy was I surprised by me being thrust into that role, and just rapidly utilizing anything I knew to get the job done, even if it wasn't anything close to 100% the correct language or solution model for the problem. \n\nJust as long as it worked, mostly glitch free, then nobody gave a flying F what programming language or tool I used to get the job done. \n\nAnd because of that, they never-ever-ever wanted to fire me, even though they had to scold me several times. \n\n------------------------------\n\nFast forward to today, and ya... \n\nTimes have really changed, mostly for the worse in this field unfortunately. \n\nI worry the good old fashioned crazy pure days of fun are behind us now in the tech sector, and companies have turned something great into something of misery... \n\nAka: the enshittification of everything by corporations, CEO's and MBA bro culture.",

The next time you are building one of your own creations, you have some ideas of what pieces you have and how they could be used, so you disassemble some of your sets, and try to use the pieces in different ways in your own creation. Maybe it'll work, and you have to order more pieces like it - or it won't work and you have to imagine something else.\n\nWhen not building you are sorting your pieces, experimenting with connecting them in different ways, trying out small techniques outside of large projects, and you get ideas for how you also could use those pieces, maybe you even get an idea for a large project using the pieces that way!\n\nAlso, you follow builders on social media, and talk with other builders, asking for inspiration, looking inside their creations, and you are always learning!\n\nWhen you have an idea for something, but absolute no knowledge of how to build it, you try sketching it, experiment with the pieces you have, will this fit? No, well how about this? Maybe if I turn that one that way?\n\nYou won't always succeed, and some projects might be abandoned, but you are always learning!\n\n  \nDon't ever expect to \"see\" the magical piece that will solve your exact problem, if you have never worked on anything even remotely similar, or even seen pieces anywhere close to what you need!\n\nAnd don't think that you'll immediately get to know thousands of pieces and how they connect - sometimes you will have to make things \"the wrong way\", or simply \"fake\" them, make a function that pretends to do the work for you, until you learn the right way. Take a look at the LEGO creations by young kids, they almost never look exactly like they should, but they are an appromixation.\n\nSo, answer 1 is: always be learning, experiment with what you have, try to solve it close enough. And answer 2 is: Don't try to look for the perfect solution when you only know 1% of everything that is - look around you, and see if you can get just a little closer to your goal!

Without that, a five minute research search can end with me realizing it's 2 am and I've gotten nothing done. \n\nAs for the rest... it really is just experience, and not feeling bad about the fact that you still need to look stuff up X years in. For example, I've been using PHP for like 20 years and I still have to look up simple functions because I forget the syntax *all the time*. Who cares, though? I know what it does and how it works, not remembering what comes first in a substring isn't the end of the world.\n\nFor me, at least, becoming a better programmer is less about memorization or always knowing what the right \"piece\" is, and is more about a general understanding and \"feel\" for how things work. You might not know if a specific function exists to do what you want, and it sucks to spend the time working on something only to find out later it was as easy as using a function that already exists, but it's probably going to happen to you more than once - but now you know the function exists and you know how to work without it. Figuring out how to do something, even the most trivial \"I'll never need to do this again\" thing, is never a *bad* thing and will help you grow. Maybe later you'll be learning another language that's similar but it doesn't have an applicable function for what you were doing, and it's not a problem because you know how to do it by hand. This probably isn't the most realistic example, the point is that I try to never look at \"I just did more than I needed to\" as a negative as long as it's not causing you to miss deadlines (and as long as it's not happening constantly).\n\nI'm hesitant to push AI as it's really easy to become overly reliant on it, and you should never rely on code AI slings out without vetting it yourself, but if you treat it like a search engine it's certainly a lot easier to say \"I'm trying to do X with Y and am wondering what methods others currently use\" than to try and get the perfect Google search or scroll through docs.\n\nIt never hurts to join a coding community, either. I haven't done that since usenet but I'm sure there are discords or whatever out there.",

        "body": "I've been on the other side: interviewing candidates for entry level back-end focused dev positions. Here's my thoughts.  \n\nActive Github profile (daily commits) - not important. \"Daily commits\" is especially not important, some days you just aren't going to have code worth committing. The important part is _having worked on a project of nontrivial complexity_. You had a problem and you tried to solve it... how did you approach the problem, and why did you choose the solution you did? Talking about the candidate's prior work is very valuable as the person trying to understand if the candidate in front of me might be a good fit.  \n\nWell-structured and documented programs (Modular & uses Swagger) - maybe of interest, but just having used tools like OpenAPI (which is the name of the spec for what was called \"swagger\" btw) or readthedocs or redoc doesn't actually tell me anything. Remember, I'm trying to figure out your approach to solving engineering problems. Does slapping swagger-ui into a maven project mean you're any more informed about how or why to use such a tool? Not necessarily. Now, if what you developed had an external API with users that needed to know about/test your endpoints, that's something worth asking about. This could dovetail into asking about other tools like Postman.   \n\n\"Well structured\" is too vague of advice and honestly I'd be wary of anyone preaching this to a new developer. Trying to perfectly architect your work in progress ToDo app is not a good use of time. Get your hands dirty. Learning from mistakes and iterating is the name of the game. Waxing philosophic about how you wanted your first app to scale to thousands of users might be relevant if you're interviewing at Netflix, but anywhere else it's probably just signalling that you didn't really understand when it's appropriate to use the tools at hand, or worse, that you might be the kind of junior dev who needlessly introduces more compexity.  \n\nProjects - yes, very important. Your plan is simple but if you follow through you will be fine. The only thing that stands out to me is that you don't have concrete examples for your projects. You should pick problem(s) that sounds interesting to you and then just work on them. You will inevitably run into topics that you know nothing about (how do I hook up my server to my database? how do I expose this API endpoint? how do I secure my endpoint behind basic AuthN? if my project is depending on other services, how do I rate limit my service so that I don't get angry emails/IP blocked from those services? is there some way I can process this data more efficiently?). If you are able to work on any actively maintained open source project, you can get some \"real\" dev experience before getting your first job.\n\nHere are some of the kinds of basic questions I have in my interview template:  \n\n* What do you do in your current position (if any)?  \n* What side projects have you worked on? Which languages do you use or which are you learning?\n* How familiar are you with <framework>? (e.g. Spring, React, etc)\n* Have you used git or other source control tools? Have you submitted (or reviewed and approved) a pull request before?\n* Do you know what a unit test is? What do you think is the point of tests?\n* Walk me through your side project (if any). What was your role, how did the design go, what were any challenges you ran into? What would you have changed?\n* <coding/logic problem>\n* Can you talk about a situation where someone disagreed with your recommendation, or vice versa, on an important aspect of a project?",

Create tight feedback loops. Run your code often.\n2. When experimenting or debugging, create hypothesis and then systematically test them\n3. Write more documentation, learn to tell the difference between good documentation and bad documentation.\n\nTo create tight feedback loops, you need to have a very short time between when you've written a bit of code, and find out if it's working or not. There are a lot of good strategies for this, and you can mix and match them according to your needs. A few I like are: Static types, tell you a lot of information about your program's correctness at compile time. REPL driven development, run snippets of code in a REPL to get immediate feedback on whether they're working as you're developing more complex systems. Good testing practices, writing tests as you work let you run the test suite as a very good way to get fast feedback on your code. When coding, I start to get nervous if I've gone more than a few minutes without running some of the code I'm writing.\n\nFor creating hypothesis, I see way too many new developers just randomly change things whenever they get stuck. If you can't clearly communicate why you think the change will fix a problem, or what the expected result of a change is, that's a sign you need to take a step back and do some thinking / learning. It takes discipline, but forming explicit hypotheses and then testing them drives you to actually understand the how and why of your code.\n\nWriting good documentation doesn't mean just adding comments to your code, but thinking about how other users of your functions / classes / projects will use them, and giving them all the necessary information to be successful. This means beginner guides, project overviews, as well as function / class level documentation. Writing good docs makes you really think about your API design and software usability on a new level.",

Not necessarily trivial - I've been programming for almost 4 decades, but I've never learned Rust for instance and if you told me I had to write something in Rust with a gun to my head I of course couldn't do it. But if I got hired for a job and was told \"Oh yeah we only work in Rust\" I'd just go \"Great, I'm excited to learn Rust!\" and not be too intimidated by it.\n\nOnce you've got a strong foundation, your choice of technology will just be driven by what you want to *do* next. You pick something you want to create (or get hired onto a job) and you learn what you need to know as you need to know it. If you're working on getting hired, you pick a project that overlaps strongly with the needs of your local job market, and you learn what you need to make yourself an attractive candidate.\n\nBut if you don't have fundamentals down, go back to working on that. Without tutorials, AI, or any of that junk. Take one of the many free university courses (university courses, even if they're free and not for credit, tend to be much more rigorous than much of the junk on youtube or whatever) and get your data structures and algorithms skills solid, etc.\n\nFirst step though is really assessing where you are right now.",

Just go with SQL/MariaDB and learn the concepts.\n\nOnce you've got a database, your Node.js app will need to somehow connect to the database you just installed. For MariaDB, there's a [package](https://mariadb.com/docs/connectors/mariadb-connector-nodejs/getting-started-with-the-node-js-connector) for that.\n\nBoom, back-end with API and data storage achieved, without tutorial, all by yourself.

Maybe you are learning a new language, a new framework, a new library. That is useful as a preparation for other things to come.\n\nWork? Yes, yes ... That will be how you sustain yourself, but most likely, if you are a craftsman, or artist, work will be less interesting, than your own projects. As you progress in skill, your work will probably be simpler, more rote, than your own projects.\n\nAbout interviews: Don't forget, that interviews are a stress situation. Depending on the person, mostly what they test is stress resilience, not your computer programming skill. What you are describing about being given 2h and a bunch of files ... That might as well be badly designed code, that is a trap into bad design. In such a situation you might have to deal with the shit you are given as code, but keep an open mind to alternative solutions.\n\nI have been working for 7y mostly using Python and still I did no good in interviews with live coding. Sometimes it was the requirements, that were too narrow, them expecting one particular solution. Other times I was too nervous and simply couldn't think straight. In contrast to my work experience, in which I basically built a company from the ground up, at least on the technical side, and on my own designed and developed multiple still maintained services, that make the company their money.\nSo mostly my interviewing experience has been quite shit, and it can happen to everyone.

And games are cool and all, and you can actually learn everything there is to programming by building games, but as you say, that's not quite where the jobs are, so it might make more sense to look at something more \"boring\" :)\n\nI'd recommend doing some web-application development with focus on the backend - since you might not need to spend that much more time on frontend right now.\n\nLook more into frameworks and libraries, than \"pure code\", e.g. if you are into **Python, take a look at Django**, and maybe follow some tutorials, get started on building **server side rendered dynamic websites**, and learn all the tricks, patterns and architectures. Build something where you have to think on a higher level of abstraction than while-loops and if-statements, struggle with understanding the framework, and use all your knowledge of the language to build something 'standard'.\n\nYou are \"done\" with learning the programming language, now you have to learn how to build programs - and the easiest way to get started is to follow advanced tutorials, and notice repeating patterns in the way they build things!\n\nAlso, don't forget about the interview-exam - store it somewhere, and pick it up again in a few weeks, try to see if it suddenly becomes easier.",

Sometimes, the companies offering the apprenticeship or their clients will hire the apprentice, which is an easy start in the industry. \n\nAlso - don't fear AI.

Any Turing complete language, which is effectively all of them, can manipulate state, which is what programs do.  Any general purpose language, which is most of them, can do most tasks.\n\nHowever, where those languages can be used is a function of implementation.  OS broadly, web browser narrowly, your favorite game, maybe Lua.\n\n> Can you give me examples of where some feature is not implemented in a language because it would directly block another feature? \n\nHow about [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)?  How a language lets you define and handle types tends to be a defining feature.  It also will impact every aspect of how you develop a program in that language.  Choose one, block the other.  A strict type system catches errors at compile time, a loose one might only catch some errors at run time.  Write your tests accordingly.\n\nAlong the same lines, [mutablity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object).  This is the break point between imperative and declarative.  The level to which that can be dictated by the programmer also defines a language.\n\n[Function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) comes to mind.  It's extremely popular, lots of languages do it, and lots don't.  There are pros and cons in implementing such a feature.  There is implementation complexity but also programmer expectation.\n\nGarbage collection?  How resources are released is a big deal in all languages.  In some languages, all clean up is the responsibility of the programmer.  In others, the programmer barely has a say.\n\nVirtual machines?  Java and .NET, among others, run inside a sandbox.  This is good for portability and stability, buy denies access to the OS; you get what the sandbox gives you.\n\nLast, but not exhaustively, libraries.  The standard libraries available to a language might dictate its use.  If what you want to do only has a library in C, you're either porting it to your favorite language, creating an interop wrapper for it, or writing in C.",

Most of them can do the task. It's just what you like.\n\nThink about C++ and Objective-C. Both were attempts to make C object-oriented. Did one stop when they heard about the other? Did C++ win because it was the best for the job? No, C++ won because it was part of AT&T which was a much bigger entity than the folks that developed Objective-C.\n\nIt's just like natural languages. Is English the best language? Some (who natively speak it) say yes, but it's only because they speak it. Others insist that their language is best. We could learn Esperanto which was a designed language where the ease of learning was a key objective. Yet, it's not popular because people love their own languages, and maybe ease of learning isn't that important. Some people love how complex their language is (or how many feature it has).\n\nTo get to your second question, there are languages that try to avoid using null, so they have to create Option types (that's one way to do it). This creates a level of mental overhead that those who have never used those types find unimportant, yet others, who think null pointer exceptions are evil and the cause of many errors feel it's justified.\n\nOr languages that want to be pure functional have problems with I/O, such as printing, and have to use complex math structures like monads, when everyone else feels printing is really easy, but it's counter to the functional philosophy.\n\nProlog was built to have a backtracking mechanism, and for most, it looks like nothing you'd expect and is hard to get your mind around, and because of that, hard to figure out. Erlang, which was inspired by Prolog, has a syntax that's hard for those used to C-style syntax (which is most popular languages) to understand, partly because it was designed before language designers decided languages should look like C.\n\nAnd was that because C was a great language? No, but it was hugely popular in industry, so to design languages that looked like C was considered beneficial because people were more likely to try out your language if they didn't have to struggle with the syntax as much.\n\nFunctional languages don't like having state, so they don't have plain old for-loops because the looping variables change values. So, they use functions like: fold, map, filter, zip, etc. to achieve looping capabilities without a looping variable. They also rely a lot on recursion.\n\nIt helps if you try these other languages like learning Prolog or Erlang or Haskell to see how different they are.",

Power point was never intended to be used as a programming language but you can use it to programm anything and thus it also wont ever recieve a lot of the common features so you would have to write them your self.\n\nA more relaistic example are garbage collections. Some languages have them others dont. And this is not a this language just hasnt gotten to the point of implementing them, its a deliberate decission to leave it to the programmer to do deal with it them self so they wont ever get that \"feature\". You can also argue that its a feature to not have a garbage collection.\n\nThis goes on with other things, like some languages are made in mind to be used with oop and thus have strong support for oop. Other are made in mind with procedual code. And the maintainers of a procedual language wont implement oop features. \n\nSo no its not about just speed.",

Each of your 4 sections has a very different width, it just looks off-putting. Make some kind of a wrapper and make sure all sections fit and take up as much space in it. OR you could embrase the chaos and do something unique, but you wont be doing that with a typical SPA with 4 vertical sections, if you want to be unique, change up the layout entirely\n- I get the idea of having one section on a screen, but that doesnt really work well for bigger resolutions. Responsiveness doesnt just mean that nothing breaks and overflows, it needs to be proportional and usable on all devices\n- As cool as the nav is, it suffers from poor UX, because its highly unclear what it is, and once you click on it to figure out, at that point you dont even need it. One thing that came to my mind is putting it vertical on the left side for example. That way you can show the section names on hover, and keep your original design. \n- Same UX applies to your technologies. Always write in words what the technologies are. This helps searchability and makes it clear for people who do not know what a whale with boxes on it or an elephant mean.\n- 2/3 of your listed projets require login (or something adjacent), no one is gonna do it. Either make sure these projects have a landing page, preview, or anything else. Or make a showcase with pictures and videos in your portfolio \n- For some reason the whole website feels cheap, i cannot quite explain why objectively. I think its the look and the color scheme of the stars in the background. But could also be the overal color scheme and font\n- Last but not least, i would put maybe a little bit more information about yourself and in general, its kinda empty\n\n\nAnd one note, whatever the SEO situation is, you probably don't need seo at all for a personal portolio. No one who you didn't already send your portfolio website is gonna look you up on google and search for it.\n\nThis is all constructive criticism. Hope the post doesnt turn into a [deleted] and you actually make some improvements and update us. Good luck!",

In fact they're probably a good idea!\n\nWhen you start to work with other people, the rule is \"Good code is self-documenting,\" meaning it should be obvious what the code does without needing explanatory comments.\n\nUse variable names, data structures and encapsulation to minimise the amount of thinking that a reader has to do. For example, I'd refactor your code to make `Card` a class:\n\n```\nclass Card:\n    def __init__(self, cardString):\n        self.name = self._getName(cardString[0])\n        self.value = self._getValue(cardString[0])\n        self.suit = self._getSuit(cardString[1])\n\n    def _getName(self, cardFirstCharacter):\n        if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards:\n            return v.faceCards[cardFirstCharacter]\n        elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A':\n            return 'Ace'\n        else:\n            return cardFirstCharacter\n\n    def _getValue(self, cardFirstCharacter):\n        if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards:\n            return 10\n        elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A':\n            return 11\n        else:\n            return int(cardFirstCharacter)\n\n    def _getSuit(self, cardSecondCharacter):\n        suits = [\"Hearts\", \"Diamonds\", \"Clubs\", \"Spades\"]\n        return next((suit for suit in suits if suit[0] == cardSecondCharacter), None)\n```\n\nThen `hit()` becomes easy:\n\n```\ndef hit():\n    drawnCard = drawCard()\n    v.cardIdens.append(drawnCard)\n    card = Card(drawnCard)\n    return card.name, card.value\n```\n\n**Variable names** - `drawnCard` and `cardString` are the exact same thing, given different names in different contexts. The `Card` class doesn't need to care that a `cardString` was just drawn from `drawCard()`. Similarly, `cardString[0]` might look a bit mad, but when we pass it to a method we rename it to `cardFirstCharacter` in the method, which clearly tells you what it is.\n\n**Data structures** - I'm really bad at this to be honest. I'm a JavaScript dev, and JavaScript only has arrays (lists) and objects (dicts), so I tend to think only in arrays and objects for any problem.\n\n**Encapsulation** - `hit()` doesn't need to know or care how a card's value is calculated, because that implementation is _encapsulated_ in the `Card` class. If `Card` is assumed to work fine (because we also wrote tests!) then a developer debugging `hit()` can ignore it. Similarly, `Card._getSuit` contains some _really_ funky code, it's borderline unreadable. But if we only care how a card gets its name and value, we don't have to read any of the funky code that gets the suit.",

Whenever I was stuck on what a function did or the right way to write something, I'd go there. It's less a tutorial and more of a reference, but it's essential.\n\nfreeCodeCamp: They have a full, comprehensive PHP course on YouTube that is completely free. It's well-structured and a fantastic alternative to a confusing paid course.\n\nAs for how long it takes, everyone's different. My biggest piece of advice, based on my own journey, is don't get lost in a forest of theory and code at the start.\n\nJust learn the absolute basics‚Äîvariables, loops, etc.‚Äîand then immediately start doing. Try to build something super simple. A huge help for me was using an AI assistant. You can literally tell it, \"Explain this to me like I'm a child,\" and it will break down complex concepts into really simple terms. Use it to guide you as you build your first small project.\n\nOnce you have some hands-on experience and things start to click, then go back and learn the deeper theory. It'll make so much more sense because you'll have actual context for it.\n\nYou got this, good luck",

I'll answer them separately:\n\n>is it necessary to read ~~all of~~ the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?\n\nI'd lean on the side of yes. Reason being - each language has it's idiosyncracies/hidden gotchas/pitfalls. Most (if not all) of these are usually spelt out in the docs. In fact, several questions people ask on reddit/stackoverflow have their answers lying partially or wholly in the docs.\n\nThat being said, there are caveats to how much of the docs one needs to read. I've added some context around this further below.\n\n>is it necessary to read ALL OF the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?\n\nNo. It's recommended, but not necessary to read ALL of the documentation.  My personal opinion is that you should only read the docs for things you're explicitly working with (though it's always good to go above and beyond).\n\n>I ask because documentation often contains a lot of specifications and information that can be overwhelming. I have been advised to read the \"reference manuals\" first, but even that is difficult.\n\nI feel you. Docs can be overwhelming especially if you're just starting out / are not familiar with the language. Here's how I do it (may or may not work for you) - I tend to generally only give docs a very surface level read/ avoid them until I'm fairly well versed with the language. Then - once I start doing more complex stuff - I tend to simply use my IDE to read docs for specific things I'm working with.\n\nE.g. in Java, if I'm using a class from the core library, I can hit F12 in my IDE to go to the class's source code and read the doc comments directly within that class.\n\nI find that this compartmentalizes the doc information to only the specific pieces of info I need for my work. It's much less overwhelming to me that way. YMMV.",

Nope.\n\nWhile you certainly can, it may not be the best way to approach it.\n\nIve been learning since jan, ive been using udemy courses, yt vids, projects and docs. Nowhere could i find a methodology to go through the documentation to find something and honestly its kinda confusing especially with poorly written docs.\n\nWhat i have found to help is to start high level and zoom into specifics as you get a better idea of what to do. \n\nHeres a recent example from my side while building a crud app. \n\nI want to create and view a blog article so what do i do? \nAssuming the html forms and express server is already set up. Ok so i need to be able to firstly log the inputs, what does it look like, how do i do that, and if its not in a useable state, how do i transform it. Ok then i need to be able to access the json file and also somehow save to the json file. Ok then lastly to view the article i need to again access the json and somehow display the info somewhere in my html( or in my case ejs template). Again what would happen if the data is not in a useable state? \n\nThis breaks down all the steps which you can then go looking for your methods. So as an example (im using node and express for the backend) i want to access the json file. So you can google that and read around or go straight to the docs (if you know roughly which module) and then look for various ways to read a json file. And then when you find, ok so in the fs module i have a few methods to choose from, .read().readFile().createReadStream(), so among these methods which one is applicable to my situation. Now you're reading the docs, looking at specifics, comparing methods with a specific goal in mind. You can even test each one to see if it works or not. \n\nI have found this to work for me... And yes its very time intensive as compared to just getting the code from AI in 30sec. \n\nLike i said, im still learning, but im keen to hear your opinions and any more seasoned professionals on how they approach docs. Its something that doesn't get explained on how to navigate and find what you need.",

The problem you need to solve is _text processing and XML handling_, but what you're asking about is _fully understanding Python_. These are two different things.\n\nPython as a language lets you be productive with only a small understanding of the language itself (that's how I got started with it; I've actually forgotten how or when I started writing Python, at some point I realised that's what I was writing my scripts in, rather than Perl or Bash).\n\nIn programming, as elsewhere, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. The stuff you write with only a minimal understanding of Python will look awkward to someone more experienced, including yourself some few months from now.\n\nGenerally what you want is:\n\n1. a _good enough_ understanding of the language semantics itself. \"Good enough\" is poorly defined, and varies by language:\n  * A language like Rust will require more investment in learning up front, but deliver very few gotchas down the line\n  * A language like Javascript or PHP will require very little investment in learning up front, but deliver more gotchas down the line\n  * Python is kinda more middle-of-the-road.\n  * For this bit you kinda just gotta read a book, preferably a good one so you don't fall asleep, and do some exercises to get a feel for it.\n1. A decent understanding of engineering in the language, as in, how do you write long-term maintainable code?\n  * This includes which libraries and external tools you're expected to use.\n  * For Python you kinda have to check /r/Python and other resources, but currently Astral tools like `uv` and `ruff` are good to have in your toolkit, and a typechecker like Microsoft's `pyright` until Astral's `ty` gets to 1.0.\n  * Static analysis, both typechecking and linters, will help you catch weaknesses in your understanding of what you're doing.\n1. A decent ability to discover relevant information in documentation, especially reading API docs.\n  * Generally searching is better than trying to memorize everything. Your brain can only fit so much information.\n  * Language servers / IDEs can help a lot with discoverability.",

That can come later once you actually develop the app, and shouldn't have much bearing on how the app is developed. \n\nWebb apps have 3 main components. A backend of some sort (usually some kind of API that serves JSON, but depending on your design it might also serve fully rendered HTML), a database that stores persistent data (user info, product info, user content, etc) that your backend interacts with, and a frontend that consists of HTML, JS, and CSS (this frontend may be served by the same backend discussed before or could be served by a different service. Doesn't really matter for development.\n\nSo how do you pick what to use? You'll get tons of answers. One answer could be that you should use whatever your team currently uses. Another might be that you have really specific performance requirements that demand a certain stack. \n\nFor you, the answer is \"whatever you want\". Really. I would look up some common stacks that maybe use languages you're already familiar with and then just pick one and go with a getting started guide. \n\nLike javascript a lot? Use MERN. More of a Python guy? Use Flask or Fast API and pick either Vue or React for the frontend. Want to learn more vanilla javascript and not bother with frameworks? Cool. You don't need React or Vue or any other framework. \n\nFor other tools, make sure you're comfortable with git, github, working in bash or zsh or some other *nix shell. Once you actually have an app developed, you should be in a good place to figure out how to actually deploy it.",

It doesn't have to be bound to a controller. It can be, but a DTO is just that: A data transfer object. It is a box of properties that simply moves data from A to B. It can be used to move data outside of the application, but it can also be used to simplify transferring data from one side of the codebase to the other.\n\nHowever, if we assume that a DTO in this case always correlates with some data being returned in a controller, then you'd most likely want to do the mapping in the controller. Being dogmatic about this can be a little difficult, as you'd quickly end up making DTO objects between the service and the controller layer for situations where you have to join together data from different sources (which can be fine as well).\n\nThe issue with having the service layer coupled with API DTOs is that other parts of the system might want to use your service without being coupled to the API (which you point out in your post), which can become a problem. However, if that doesn't happen, then there's no issue.\n\nMy point is that there's no single rule. It depends on the dependencies within the system, as well as how the system will develop over time. \n\nMy general advice here is to push everything outward from the core of your application until it starts to become annoying. When you've found the sweetspot, then keep it there until other things start making it annoying, then consider pushing it further out (or pull it inwards) depending on how it is annoying. Don't be set in stone; instead, be pragmatic and flexible.",

To transfer this to a persistence layer, DTO is used and in the ORM context, they are entities. Without it, we have to do this mapping on our own.\n\nThen we can can make a simplified DAO service, which provide CRUD operations we can use in the controller (presentation layer). It's already possible to use the ORM operations directly in the controller, but I prefer a service class to make this cleaner.\n\nSomehow, we have to map from entityDTO to presentationDTO. The presentationDTO is used to return a response to the client. \n\nI read that this mapping is done in the service layer, the problem:\n\nIf we map the entityDTO in the service to the presentationDTO, the service will always return a presentationDTO that is expected to be used in a controller or view.   \n  \nFor example, in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) core, we do not want to return a response from the entityDTO directly, since they contain navigation properties. We want the JSON output to exclude the navigation props and instead translate type references to foreign key fields. That is why we map to a presentationDTO.\n\nBut sometimes we want to use service class in another service class and we do not want to already return a presentationDTO from the service. In this case, the service should return an entityDTO so we can use this data in the other services if necessary. Then if we want to map this entityDTO to a presentationDTO, it's best to do this in the controller.\n\nDo you know what I mean?",

You *can, it's possible,* in the same way anything you want to code is possible. The convention is to not return these in this form. They are mapped the moment they are retrieved from a database, so by definition they are returned from the Data Access Object (or DB layer) and this is unavoidable - so you always start by mapping the data from a persistence driver to a language class instance (or dictionary).\n\n  \nWhile controllers return a *response* that can easily just be whatever the service returns wrapped in whatever response your protocol expects. The response from a service is what is in question here.\n\nIn spring for example, you will commonly see in a service:\n\nexample() {  \nvar stuff = repo.getStuff();  \n...business logic...  \n\n\nreturn stuff.stream().map(StuffToDtoMapper::EntityToDTO}....;\n\n)\n\nThis is done in the service layer because the service doesn't want to return the entire entity model to the controller, assuming it's a service method that is called directly by a controller, often times, the service might not even be receiving the entity itself, but rather an intermittent object still on the database side (e.g. spring projections) which it would still want mapped to a presentation DTO, as you said.\n\nWhen you want to use the entire entity in a different service, which is completely normal, you define a separate method in your service (some even opt for different services, but that's overkill in my opinion) that returns the entity itself, indicating that it is used for inter-service communication and not to be routed back through a controller.\n\nAll these things are just conventions, you can technically do anything you want, but this communicates intent to other developers who are familiar with the convention.",

I'm not trying to sound like a smartass or anything, but sometimes the most simple route can be the best! You can learn stuff like design patterns and algorithms and stuff, but if you feel like you are too heavily reliant on AI I'd suggest trying to make a simple project (like a sudoku or a simple calculator ) and just turn off copilot or anything of the likes and just start googling (the AI from Google also doesn't count) learning to use documentation and efficient research helps a lot for becoming a better programmer especially if you try to dissect your problem in smaller bites and start to get hang of how you could figure out problems by pure logic it will then only make you stronger in coding when you do allow yourself to use AI. But practising is the best medicine imo. You seem like a smart individual but don't get yourself twisted over achieving stuff like becoming a 10x developer, I'm guessing a part of having that amount of skill is also part of just loving to code and doing it a lot (of course there are cases of people who just inhale knowledge and have such a robust logical mind that it comes easy to them but that is besides the point) and if you can think of the logic how to tackle problems during coding before even touching your keyboard then you're on the right track (not a must but is nice) coding is just logical thinking.

If someone just wanted to vibe code their way into software that's going to be riddled with problems that's probably a different story.\n\nAssuming AI is going to reach the point where it's actually useful at scale then you'll want to be in a position where you can still read, debug, and modify whatever code the various models you use will output.\n\nAt the moment AI isn't really a net benefit for a lot of companies or projects that are rather large, but realistically with the amount of investment they've seen they likely will be. To clarify a bit, they're decent at writing a number of things, but I've also seen them do a number of dumb things that cost more time than they've saved.\n\nThe other rather significant problem is that while you can use them to build a number of things by piecing things together it starts to fail when you have to debug even relatively small programs. Even if you've all the features enabled to have it try to analyze, run, and test a program it will still often fail somewhere. Though it will completely confidently proclaim that what it wrote it works properly when it definitely doesn't. I've seen this just trying to get it write unit tests for things that are only mildly complicated. Other times the project is just too big to fit in the context window. A bit of an anecdote here, but I still find it humorous seeing certain models try to run code (not written using Python) in a Python interpreter even when you explicitly told it not to.\n\nI expect we'll see a shift from monolithic to more microservice based programs to help meet AI in the middle, but we're not there across the industry today.",

This means learning how to learn is a step in its own. You're probably best just looking for an online community of software engineers with experience and asking there (forums, discords, etc), or just Googling it and hoping you find results. Examples:\n\nBanking and financial processing are extremely heavy on the security, regulations, and infrastructure side of things, so that's where most of your research/investment goes- under the hood I'd imagine most banks etc use very similar software, all just making secure API calls to one-another. Your learning resources are going to be regulations and industry insights to the current norms. Your only hope to breaking into the market is probably innovation (doing something known, just cheaper or higher quality).\n\nComparatively, something like game development would be the opposite. You're creating a lot of unique systems; usually without significant regard for standards/security. I.e. outside of specific cases, there's not really one preferred solution.

There are also millions of other developers hoping to break into freelancing who are charging very little in order to build a reputation.\n* It's not just enough to want to earn money from home. You actually have to have the aptitude and interest. Learning to be a developer takes years of dedication and hard work. Most people who think it sounds interesting give up once they realize how hard it is.\n\nIf you're interested in being a developer, the only solid route is a 4-year Computer Science degree (or equivalent), then a few years of in-person employment to get experience, then you might have a chance of going remote eventually.",

Learn something like data structures, loops, and functions, then immediately put them into practice through small, fun projects. For example, if you learn about lists and loops, build a simple quiz game or a to do list app. This way, you‚Äôll reinforce your learning and keep it engaging. Projects don‚Äôt have to be big or complex at this stage so just think of them more as practice reps.\n\nExam prep and coding will come down to prioritization. Your exam is the gateway to METU, so make sure that‚Äôs your main focus until it‚Äôs done. But coding can act as a mental refresh so use it as a productive break from studying. Consistency beats intensity so it‚Äôs better to code a little regularly than to burn out trying to do everything at once.

Then expose the Pi server to the internet however, e.g. using Cloudflare.\n\nFor a more robust setup, I'd go with an ESP32 (capable of deep sleep when idle) to read the button, which sends a notification to a backend API server, which updates a separate static web server.

Yes, Dijkstra's algorithm is definitely widely used.\n\nIt's generally not meaningful to compare things like \"number of iterations\" or \"number of function calls\" between two different algorithms, or two different implementations of the same algorithm (unless they're very similar to each other).\n\nIf actual practical performance is what matters, then comparing the actual running time is what matters, so that you can fairly compare the effects of things like synchronization overhead.\n\nProbably, the most useful comparison would be to draw graphs of the *average* running time for graphs of different sizes, and also with different numbers of threads (or CPU core counts) so that you can see where the break-even point is, i.e. where the benefits of parallelism outweigh the extra overhead. Varying the sparsity of the graphs would also be interesting.\n\nIf you're interested in the theoretical big-O complexity, then numerical measurements don't really matter at all, and instead you'd need to formally analyze and rigorously prove some kind of upper-bound on the amount of work done by each thread. This is likely to be a lot more difficult than just taking measurements.\n\n----\n\nAn additional note: as you said, the basic form of Dijkstra's algorithm gives the \"single-source shortest paths\" from a source to *all* other nodes. But in practice, we are often only interested in the path from one source to one destination. A simple and obvious optimization is to just stop the algorithm as soon as the destination node is expanded (because at that point its path is guaranteed to be optimal). \n\nA less obvious optimization is to do a *bidirectional* search, which works both forwards from the source and backwards from the destination simultaneously, terminating when they meet. This often results in expanding dramatically fewer nodes. (If you imagine the \"frontier\" as being circular, then then two circles with radius d/2 have half the area compared to one circle with radius d.)\n\nYou might want to see if your parallel algorithm can be adapted to handle one or both of these optimizations. That'll make it more likely to be useful in practice.",

        "body": "I use AI to help with everything. In fact, I've entirely changed my solo development stack to be more AI-friendly. That doesn't mean I don't know how to code. I can absolutely step in where AI gets stuck and write the code myself. But I like productivity, and I'm much faster using AI assistance, especially in that new stack I mentioned. It's crazy how fast I can knock out features using that stack and AI.\n\nNow, some will say that AI-generated code can be buggy, and they are not wrong. I use a philosophy of delegation, not abdication. Any code that goes into my codebase is my responsibility, regardless of how it is generated. So, I read every line and use automated tests to ensure I'm not accidentally breaking anything while going fast. \n\nSo, are you doing anything wrong? Maybe. You definitely want to be comfortable coding because AI isn't always the best solution for a given problem. That said, once you are comfortable coding in your language and framework, pretending AI doesn't exist will slow you down. It's not going away; it's a powerful tool, and we should learn to use it. Even Senior Engineers can get a non-trivial productivity boost from AI.",

If you need to mutate a variable, instead of the function mutating the variable directly, set the function to take an input, mutate that input and return the value you want to mutate. That way the function can do the same behavior, mutating the variable, but it can also save that variable to a new variable.\nHere‚Äôs a sample snippet of python code to explain what I mean.\nEdit: Reddit messing up formatting here.\n\ndef increment(x):\n        return x + 1\n\ncount = 0\n\ncount = increment(count)  # updates original\n\nnew_count = increment(count)  # keeps original\n\nCount starts at zero, the increment function increments it by one and then you save the incremented count to new_count. This structure is much clearer to people reading your code, the function can now be used for more than just mutating a single global variable and you are discouraged from creating single use functions.\n\nAs you get better at programming, free floating variables become much rarer. Most variables are used as temporary storage for working data, (and if we are really to get into the weeds they act as human readable abstractions that become pure memory operations at compile time) while all persistent data has a clear owner. This makes it much easier to reason about where data lives, who‚Äôs allowed to change it, and how long it will exist. If you are making simple python scripts right now it might seem tempting to do things quick and dirty, after all that is what python is good for, but developing good habits in the beginning pay dividends once you have to start working on more complex systems.",

        "body": "Well there is no right way of learning coding. Just like in every field there are multiple different subfields that look similar from the outside but differ much.\n\nThe best way of learning (for me at least) is doing something I'm interested in. A little passion project. First smaller ones, later bigger ones.\n\nA broad glance of subfields:\n\nWeb Development: Mostly by this you will only mean a front end, so a Website with only logic on you Computer, no server involved. Using GitHub pages you can host this for free, so it's a great thing to start with. If you want to learn more about this, look at the odin project. (The first half is frontend only, the second one is Backend). Or code along some of Brackeys videos, those were some cool projects for me. As you do this, you will start to understand more and more.\n\nBackend Development: Mostly APIs. Send a request to a server, get a response. You can get very creative with this, as there are really no limits. For this you will need a server, so this will cost something. (Or everything is only locally on your machine, whing is possible not not satisfying (or at least I thought that always).\n\nMobile development: Apps for Android (or iOS). This will be hard to get into if you don't know Java (or Swift). It's also free (to make, publishing in the app store will cost a little bit), so you got a plus point there.\n\nGame development: Self explanatory. You will need a good PC for this. Like an entry level gaming PC at least. And it's not beginner friendly. (Easy to get something, very hard to get something half decent). This is very cool but if you run out of Ideas ist very hard very quick. Also there is a very steep learning curve. Here I would recommend Unity.\n\nRobots / embedded devices: You want to code on some hardware. The easiest is to buy an Arduino, the cheapest to buy an ESP 32. I would roll with the ESP32, as you can do some really cool stuff with that and you can still use the Arduino IDE for ease of use.\n\nDesktop Apps: Apps for Windows / MacOS. Intestingy this is a field I didn't discover much, as I didn't have an Idea on what to make. You can use nearly any Programming language in the start and if you don't care about the design. Can't give much advice on this. \n\nData Science: Working with data, and getting data. WebScraping and analyzing data with Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Take a Website, download it, so stuff with it, repeat with the next page. For me this is kinda fun, as every website has a different challenge. You can try to download the entire product catalog or job offerings of some company automatically for example. (Be aware companies won't be happy if you start blasting with requests, and might block you. Then you have to wait a bit or switch to the next page). This is free but a grey area in law. Most of the time it's ok you don't cause damage. Put a 200ms delay before every request.\n\nLittle scripts / automations. For example something in Python / PowerShell / Bash / Whatever. This is what I do productively by now. Writing litter helper solution to problems only I have. Like a script to delete all files in a directory (as windows is slow with many tiny files), to use ffmpeg more efficiently on folders, copy stuff from multiple Excel sheets to one.\n\nEthical Hacking: Just don't. You need a massive foundation of knowledge for this one. The learning curve is vertical. You will gain knowledge for this on your path, no matter what you want to do. Don't start with it.\n\nYou don't know where to start? \nMake something visual. Something where you can see the progress right as you do it, just to understand the fundamental concepts. If you are a bloody beginner, scratch will be nice. If know a little bit, try Python turtle too. Look at YouTube beginner tutorials and try to code along something you find interesting. \n\nGeneral stuff:\n\nMake a GitHub Account. Use GitHub. Can't say this enough, version control is important. Everyone is using it, start as soon as you feel comfortable. It will make you like easier. Use a Git GUI, I like GitKraken (free for students) or sourcetree. \n\nApply for GitHub student. This will get you loads of free stuff (without having to prove you are a student for every company, as many trust GitHub). \n\nUse a good IDE. With student benefits (use GitHub) you get the entire enterprise product line of JetBrains IDEs. This will help you imensely, as this will cut out the environment setup I spent ages on (and quit before starting. Don't make the same mistakes, do it right). An exception is Embedded, when coding on Arduino or ESP 32 I wound recommend the Arduino IDE for ease of use with the boards.\n\nExtra bonus:\n\nI'm really mad I didn't do this when starting. Keep you first projects. Don't delete, they dont take up space (except video games). Use GitHub to store and forget. I regret not doing this. The lengths I would go to see my first ever projects....\n\nEdit: Thank you for reading my essay",

Node.js with Express is way easier to pick up when you already know JavaScript, and you can focus on learning backend concepts without learning a whole new language at the same time.\n\nAt Metana we actually see this transition a lot. Frontend devs wanting to go full stack. Most find it easier to stick with JavaScript ecosystem first (Node/Express) then maybe explore Java later if needed. But if your project specifically needs Spring Boot or you're targeting Java jobs, then go for it.\n\nEither way, the key is building that project while you learn. Don't just do tutorials tho. Actually build your backend API as you go through the course material. You'll learn way faster that way.",

Once you finish that, do it again.

I was able to have an interesting conversation with the HM during the final interview. \n\nAnd I have a lot of social anxiety, but had a job in the past that required I talk to people a lot on the phone. So even tho I may be awkward in social settings, my work relationships are usually much easier to maintain. \n\nThen again, I like playing politics at work, I think it's kinda fun. But here are some additional tips I'd recommend:\n\n* audibly repeat back your understanding of what someone else wants you to do to avoid confusion\n\n* Don't complain about co workers, it's fine to ask your boss for feedback on how to handle a coworker, but don't come across as attacking them. \n\n* Only bitch upwards, it's not a good look if you're complaining about bosses to people less senior than you,but when you do complain about something to your boss, offer solutions\n\n* praise often, praise early - if someone has a good idea, tell them. This avoids coming across like a contrarian and shows you're open to other people's ideas. \n\n* admit when you don't know something - no one likes a no it all especially about matters you clearly don't understand. This gives your thoughts and opinions more weight when you do express them.\n\n* Use words like \"We\", \"Us\", & \"As a team\", instead of \"you created this bug on this PR\", \"we created this bug, and we missed it during the PR\", \"what if we need to add  X functionality?\"\n\n* form relationships with users (if non public facing software) and stakeholders. If you have a bug you're investigating, just tell the user, this builds more trust and good will. \n\n* when debating about designs/patterns/architecture, just don't say \"this isn't good because X, Y, Z\", ask people questions in a way that it will lead them to the conclusion you want them to make. \"Will this work under this use case?\", \"what if the user does X?\", etc. \n* ask your manager how other folks are doing, \"how is John doing lately? He seems a bit stressed out or anxious\". Shows you're aware of people's emotions and you're concerned about others. \n\nI feel like there are more, but this is what I've found.",

The silent recession that no one in Canada/usa wanted to admit too is the culprit.\n\nBack in the day, people used to code in assembly, and when compilers became cheap ans widly available it caused a major disruption in the job market.\n\nSame thing with the \"no hardware, all code\" mantra that established itself in the 2000s. Today, almost no cs major knows (or admits to using) C. Or even that its a seperate language from C++.\n\nIm so happy i stayed away from web stacks and kept to low level programing on Ucs and embedded linux.

The reality is companies are trying to squeeze devs harder and invest less in training (especially less junior hires and interns).  They're squeezing harder because interest rates are higher and changes in tax policy meant they can't deduct R&D expenses from their income.  Profitability is king right now. \n\nSecond, juniors definitely are getting shafted hard right now (not 2008 level bad, but still rough).  But mid/senior roles also getting shafted too, and our jobs are anything BUT safe.   We got the benefit of a *little* bit of lube first, but it's still not enough to stop things from being painful. \n\nTo explain: a ton of mid & senior+ devs got laid off over the last few years. I was one of them.  Less than 6 months after hopping to a different Principal job they gutted my new department.  Basically nothing I could have done would have saved me. *Some* of us were able to line up replacement jobs (thankfully me) due to having the right experience.  \n\nBut the job prospects are still not great, even for proven seniors.  Companies know this and are using it to squeeze us hard to get more work for the same pay, and they're not afraid to fire people if they can't keep up.\n\nIn a few years the pendulum will probably swing back for tech.  AI isn't the silver bullet clueless executives claim. If the code I'm seeing daily is any indicator, ultimately AI code generation will ALSO generate a lot of maintenance (and scalability and quality) nightmares.  Plus if companies DON'T hire juniors, then when the market recovers they'll have to pay a  lot more to get experienced talent... and then they're going to turn back to hiring juniors to save money.",

The rise in AI-generated content has blurred the lines of authenticity in online discussions.

People don‚Äôt usually talk like that on Reddit ‚Äî especially in tech circles where tone tends to be blunt, sarcastic, or informal.\n2. **Generic Advice & Vague Details** A lot of posts give surface-level advice or talk about issues in super broad terms without getting into the gritty technical details ‚Äî which is common with AI output unless prompted very specifically.\n3. **Repetitive Phrasing and Templates** You‚Äôll often see similar turns of phrase or story structures across different posts ‚Äî things like ‚ÄúAfter X years in the industry, I realized Y‚Äù or ‚ÄúAm I the only one who feels Z?‚Äù It starts to feel formulaic.\n4. **Influx of Low-Effort Engagement Farming** Some users (or bots) are using AI to mass-generate posts and comments to farm karma, drive traffic, or build fake authority on niche topics.\n\n# ü§ñ Signs a Post Might Be AI-Generated\n\n* Lacks personal anecdotes or uses generic placeholders.\n* Echoes common sentiments without adding anything new.\n* Oddly balanced tone: too formal but pretending to be casual, lol.\n* Uncanny ability to sit on the fence on controversial topics.\n* Unnatural use of üí© emojis.\n* Overuse of the em dash (‚Äî).\n\n# üß© You're Not \"Schizo\" ‚Äî You're Perceptive\n\nIt‚Äôs unsettling, yeah. And it *does* erode trust ‚Äî not just in content, but in online community culture itself. Part of Reddit‚Äôs value used to be real, lived experience and human nuance. If that‚Äôs being diluted, it makes total sense to question what you're reading and who's actually behind it.\n\nIf you're feeling disoriented by all this, it‚Äôs not paranoia ‚Äî it‚Äôs pattern recognition. You‚Äôre seeing a shift, and you‚Äôre trying to make sense of it. That‚Äôs a sane reaction.\n\nWant to talk about how to filter for more authentic content or spot AI in the wild?",

Whenever it was announced an exam would be open book my stomach sank. It was an awful feeling. Because that let me know the test was going to be difficult enough to *warrant* it to be open book.\n\nInterviews are going to be the same way. If you're allowed to flippantly use AI? The interview is going to be difficult enough that it ***requires*** you to use AI. It's not going to be a leetcode question from 2024 that you can blow through because you have AI at your disposal. It's going to be a uniquely crafted question that's difficult enough that you *need* AI. Fuck that.\n\nSo yeah, if I were job hunting, I would be practicing leetcode. Hopefully I could line something up before the hellscape of AI-interviews takes hold, because ain't no way I'm gonna play that game.",

You can't just YOLO out code in the same way anymore - everything needs to go through a more rigorous product development process. Also, while the work you're doing may seem simple, you're a small cog in a bigger machine. As you get more senior in your org, you become more and more responsible for figuring out how all of these cogs fit together rather than shipping out code yourself.\n\nIf you're working on internal tools and infra, those teams have many of the same challenges, but also some of their own. The business problems you deal with at a large enterprise are pretty unique and require you to build bespoke solutions. Senior engineers have to deal directly with stakeholders within the company - product teams, other infra teams, program managers, etc. I work in a security org, and honestly stakeholder management is at least as difficult a problem for us as the engineering itself is.",

You'll see that nothing can be achieved alone, and in order to do anything, you need buy-ins, cross functional coordination, and the stars to align. This is okay when you're a L4 and you're typically judged on execution. So you could shrug it off and leave it to your manager or senior to manage that BS part of it and write it down as \"blocked\" because the roadmaps don't cross and you'll just work on something else.\n\nAs you get more senior (this could also mean more tenured at the same level), there are higher stakes. It could range from promotion to your very survival. Once you have that kind of pressure pushing on you, it is \\*entirely\\* on you to move that social aspect of things to deliver on the final product. You can no longer lean on reasons like, oh other org wasn't on board. Nope, it was your job to plan for it.\n\nWhile all of this is happening, you're still coding at the fastest velocity you can go. You're constantly migrating and innovating the underlying tooling so the next wave of L4s can just plug and go. You're thinking about your own performance reviews where \"delivered crud app\" becomes a mediocre expected outcome. Have you raised the bar on yourself? on your team? on the company itself? No? Why do we keep you.\n\n...\n\nAnyways thats how big tech cooks. But for now, weee free food!!",

        "body": "Ph.D holding macroeconomist here. Work in tech side of finance (quant)\n\nIt was much worse. The unemployment rate was 9 percent, over double the current unemployment rate. Furthermore the unemployment rate continued to rise for 2 years  after the recession to almost 11 percent and didn't meaningfully fall for half a decade. Just so you know the unemployment rate for young people is ALWAYS higher than the average unemployment rate, so you were in a market where almost 20 percent  (18.8%) of people under 25 could not find ANY job, including part time work, \n\n source: (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRUN24TTUSM156S)\n\nOutside the U.S. it was worse, Spain and Greece youth unemployment rose to 50 percent and remained there through the first half of the 2010s. It wasn't until 2014 when the economy started too feel like it was going back to normal and even then the U.S. unemployment rate was still 6 percent (which is recessionary).\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high)\n\nMy facebook, which back then was young cool social media,  could be divided into two types of people. People with bachelors degrees from prestigious schools and people who went to normal schools. The people at prestigious schools ended up fine, but the ones who went to your average school had their lives permanently altered. Your talking about people with business degrees go  or math degrees go work dead end service industry jobs until their mid 20s or teach english in Japan. Some of those people eventually retooled or went back to school and have careers, others are still bar tending somewhere.\n\nThis is economic research from that time period, from IZA, which is one of the top affiliation groups in labor economics [https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf](https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf)\n\nNow for the CS job market faired better than most other jobs. Smart phones had just been invented so the tech boom seeds had been planted, but back then people weren't throwing money at software companies like they have been the past 6 or 7 years. Like I worked a data science/risk quant job at a regional bank and all the old guys in the office were laughing at the \"ridiculously high IPO price for facebook at 35$\".  People would throw money into apple, which had great P&L financials, but the things that companies were really looking at then where oil and energy. Fracking had just taken off etc.\n\nFuthermore, the 2010 recession was a financial crisis. That means it effected the finance industry and guess what is part fo the finance industry? Venture Capital. Venture Capital is partially funded by banks. 2009 was a time when there was a lot of regulation was introduced on banks. Banks had taken or were foreced to take government loans, wells fargo and JP Morgan were asked to do acquisitions of bad banks. The crisis caused  a lot of focus on risk management practices in ganks and venture capital inherently is taking high risks. So it basically meant that startup funding was inherently lot harder to get.  Furthemore, at the time of that recession the last big recession was the previous tech bubble, so there was a lot more skepticism about the tech industry.\n\nI think one thing to realize when talking about job markets  is that most people who went through the last recession are in their mid 30s. Like people who graduated college beween 2009 and 2012    are all 33 to 40. This means you have an  entire generation of workers that are in their late 20s that have never seen a recession and don't ahve anything base it on. So they are quick to toss the word around. The other thing is that people who graduated between 2020 through 2022 basically went to the best job market in 50 years and its completely due to COVID stimulus.  That means that people who missed the boat feel that the job market is worse than it actually is, because your expectations are anchored on that boom. LIke I don't buy for a second AI is the main reason entry level hiring is down. Sure this is part of it, but the real reason that hiring is down is that interest rates are high (meaning capital is expensive and finance firms won't throw around money) and you had massive over hiring in the panemic.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)\n\nLike this is a time series plot of software engineering job postings on indeed from the FED. See how it goes up and down, that isn't normal behavior. If it was growing normally it would be slight increase over time. What his shows is the the number of job postings in the peak of 2021  over doubled relative to the prepandemic number of job postings. In 2025 its about 60 percent of the prepandemic level.\n\nThere is very good chacne that tech industry might have a slower recovery than every other industry after a recession. I don't think this will be CS and Data Science as a whole, its just that a lot more hiring of those jobs are going to be taking place at non-tech companies and your not going to see these salaries of people making 200k TC straight out of school at tier one companies. Its going to be a lot more I just go my first CS job making 85k at a regional bank or  home depot, and less of those fat equity grants.",

The basic stuff you'd expect for a dwindling economy.\n\nBut, the internet, and tech was more fun. Things were fresh, new; not every idea and thing created was built with a paywall behind it.\n\nThen, there was nothing even relatable to the scale of what's going on now. AI tech, social media showing what little promise, lack of privacy. A lot of it has been learning new things that re-invent the wheel over and over again.\n\nAnd discussing the current market allows for teams to discuss strategy.

Software engineers weren't as prevalent.\n\nThey weren't good economic times though. Houses where I'm from sold for about the price of a VCR after being gutted.

Agentic AI is where companies are now adding evals, memRAGs, pre-determined prompts and answers, and much more to increase accuracy with a proper workflow to solve a bunch of different tasks. Keep a lookout in the next month and all these new industry panels should be on the ai4 website and you can see for yourself how these companies are using LLM properly https://ai4.io/videos/. Whenever you use Grok or ChatGPT on the web is just the surface level what the latest companies are using LLM for. At the end of the day these LLMs are just probabilistic neural nets trained on very generic public internet data and are not as accurate as you want them to be since they aren't trained on the specific data for your specific needs. The accuracy is based on the transformer model and it seems we might be nearing the end of that architecture's accuracy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large\\_language\\_model. \n\nThe reason why LLMs are notoriously bad with logical or math calculation is because it doesn't actually do deterministic calculations but just probabilistic \"what is the most likely words it should output is\" based on your token input, aka prompt.\n\nAlso, a large majority of these companies still need software developers as they are the final guard rails of these LLM outputs.  \n  \n Its just that the economy is kinda cooked that's all and everyone is trying to save a buck.",

My understanding is one person acts as the stand-in who just goes to meetings and tells everyone some excuse for why he's blocked this week, then somebody else, or a team of somebody elses makes tiny amounts of progress on the tickets assigned to them.\n\nYou'll learn ways to spot them.  Here's some flags I've noticed:\n- The resumes follow a similar template and format.\n- They have a LinkedIn profile that doesn't have a photo, or has a clearly AI-generated photo.\n- You can click on the \"more info\" link on the LinkedIn profile to see when it was created.  Surprise, it was a month ago, even though they supposedly have 15 YOE as a senior engineer... it's possible they never got around to making a LinkedIn, just highly unlikely.\n- Sometimes they include a Github link too.  The projects they have there are forks of somebody else's project with no meaningful contributions added by the candidate (been a while since I interviewed... I bet at this point you could have some AI agent drum up some fake commits under your name fairly quickly)\n- I saw plenty where the name and photo on the github didn't match the linkedin....\n\nI actually had one where the LinkedIn profile they linked to on the application was publicly trying to recruit other people into the scam.  I dunno if he accidentally linked the wrong account, or just gave up on that application before we got around to looking at it.  \n\nHe had a whole Google Slides deck that detailed the whole process where they apply for the jobs and set up the interviews for you under a bogus name.

The promotion despite acknowledged slow work is your company's way of saying \"we don't really care about output as long as you show up,\" which sounds great until you realize it's professional purgatory for someone who actually wants to contribute meaningfully.\n\nThe stark contrast between your startup energy and day job lethargy tells you everything you need to know. When you're passionate about work, 4 hours feels productive and energizing. When you're not, 3 days feels like slow torture. Your motivation isn't broken, it's just directed elsewhere, which is completely normal for high achievers stuck in low-challenge environments.\n\nConsider setting artificial deadlines and challenges for yourself while you figure out your exit strategy. Sometimes gamifying boring work or finding ways to exceed expectations can restore some sense of accomplishment. A service like Applyre could help you explore roles that better match your drive and interests without your current employer knowing.\n\nYour startup success proves you still have that rockstar capability when the work matters to you. Don't let corporate welfare syndrome convince you otherwise. Use this stable income to fund your side project's growth, but don't let comfort trap you in mediocrity forever. Your fulfillment matters more than easy paychecks.",

Its basically saying \"we were very clear about what you needed to do, And you didn't do it so we're firing you\".\n\nIf they put you on a PIP and then they fire you even if you did everything they asked you to do, then they're opening themselves up to a lawsuit.\n\nSo I would maybe read up a bit on PIPs and also make sure that if things look shady (i.e., if you're actually doing good at your job but they're trying to fire you for cause when they should instead be laying you off), that you figure out what recourse you have.",

By far, the most common reason is that your manager didn't collect enough supporting data to support firing you, if you choose to sue.  For example, you should have gotten a written summary of every 1:1 with your manager since the PIP began. If not, they may want to allow for more time to get better documentation.\n\nYou don't need documentation to close the PIP without firing you.  All your manager has to say is \"u/linkthecat's performance has been acceptable and I want to close the PIP.\"  Boom, done.\n\nThe fact that it's extended most likely means that your manager still wants to get rid of you, but HR is blocking it.\n\nThere are chances that your manager said \"they seem to be improving, but I need more time\". This happens, but it's unusual, simply because PIPs are unpleasant for the manager and they're unlikely to want to extend them.  \n\nIt's also possible that they're waiting to get your replacement.

It takes longer because of the extra ai code generated, and it's more important to unblock QA now.  As a team we are doing great, but my own code output has dropped because of so much time spent reviewing ai code.  Our top devs can push way more quality code than I can, so honestly my time is better spent unblocking them.  The PRs need approvals before they move to QA.\n\nThe problem is still getting worse though:  as more of us get better with ai, reviewing code is becoming a real bottleneck.  Even with using ai to help review ai generated code, I am still responsible for the PR if I approve it, so I still need to read and understand every line.  I'm not sure where this trend is going to lead.",

I think that the companies that hyper-fixate on not hiring junior engineers and using AI as a quick fix will die. I include Amazon, Meta, maybe even Google in this list, for the sole reason that outside of AI you can probably count the new service or major product launches that any average person has heard of from any of them on one hand. It's all a crux to keep the share price high, at a time where MBA's seem to be ruling tech.\n\nWhat I can see happening is a company or two, maybe more emerging, and eating their lunch. It might be an innovation in search, a social network that dooms Facebook and Instagram, a marketplace that dominates the market, or maybe even something totally new. They'll look at how directionless big tech is, and they'll build something great from a hoard of juniors with respectful senior leadership. Those companies will be what people aspire to work for, relegating FAANG to Boomer Tech.\n\nUltimately, engineers don't *need* to be employed. They could build something, or they could make their own luck. A shift in the stock market and a downturn in tech might be enough for VC's to think that big tech has had its day, and for them to invest elsewhere - causing a shift towards new tech.",

(I think juniors should be treated better than that, but point still stands.)\n\nIf you're out of things to do, that's different. But most companies aren't.\n\nFWIW - most places I've been at stopped hiring juniors due to belt tightening.

Lottery tickets are discretionary spending despite what gambling addicts believe. When you apply for a job, you're actively seeking a new income source. Apples and oranges.\n\n> After over 200 applications to MLE and data scientist positions (even data analyst roles that I‚Äôm clearly overqualified for), I‚Äôve only been met with rejection or ghosting.\n\nEven before universities had specific graduate programs targeting Data Science / Machine Learning (so before 2019 lets say), it was very challenging to find a position where you fucked with models/charts, tweaked parameters, and performed EDA all day. And this was peak Data Science mania hiring among corporate leadership -- Data Science was the GenAI before GenAI existed from ~2016 through 2019. Sounds great right? Except boy do I know a ***ton*** of people in that space who got laid off between 2020 and 2022 so lets set the nostalgic rose-colored glasses down.\n\n> Both of these times, the recruiters have been enthusiastic to hear about my experience, and often praise my resume and my accomplishments.\n\nThe fundamental challenge for Data Science / Machine Learning roles is an organization will need 1, maybe 2, of that type of skillset for every ~500 run-of-the-mill software engineers that they need to build software products. Maybe closer to 1 every 30 if you're a highly specialized quant firm or something. This is very specialized labor, for a very specialized purpose, and orgs just don't need that many of them relative to other roles.\n\nIf you're looking exclusively in NYC, or for fully remote positions, you may very well be competing with the absolute cream of the crop top-tier candidates. NYC is an extremely competitive market -- lots of people. You could even be one of those top-tier candidates, but when there's 20 other candidates who are lets say within ~10% of each other in terms of performance and team fit coming out of an interview, what the manager had for breakfast the day of the interview could be a significant contributing factor to which candidate gets hired. The candidate that got hired instead of you doesn't necessarily need to be \"god tier\".\n\nSo, some practical advice:\n\n1. Increase your volume of applications\n2. Target different markets/sectors. ~80% of your applications in finance, but no bites? Try energy, medical devices / medicine, ad tech -- you get the idea.",

Orosz is the author of the fantastic newsletter Pragmatic Engineer and he's assembled a lot of his wisdom into this fantastic book. It's broken out into sections for each level of engineering, so you'd definitely get a lot of mileage out of it.\n\n\\- Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards and Neal Ford. This is a little more advanced, and you probably wouldn't need the last third that talks more about selling your architectural vision, but it's a great overview of the different kinds of distributed architectures you'll encounter in the wild.\n\n\\- A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout. Really quick read and an implied rebuttal to Clean Code by Bob Martin. I really enjoyed this one and it provides a good framework for how to think when writing code.\n\nThe reason I've read way too many software books is because I host a podcast called Book Overflow ([YouTube link here](https://www.youtube.com/@BookOverflowPod), but we're on every major platform) where each week my co-host and I read and discuss a new tech book. We've done episodes on all the books I've listed, and have even interviewed every one of their authors! If you don't have time to read the whole books, you might get a lot of insight from just listening to the episodes!",

If you weren't \"getting it\" odds are there are some structural problems in your QA department that have nothing to do with you.

        "body": "Happened to me at my last job (not CS). I was a one-man digital marketing/analytics department under my manager. Always got fantastic reviews, sales soared, everything golden. \n\nThen after COVID and work from home, my manager started riding me over every little thing. I had been given tons of independence up to that point because our sales were so great and because my manager honestly didn‚Äôt know exactly what it was I did. I built the entire position from scratch and my manager had no computer skills so digital marketing and data analytics were not something he could really check my work on. So as long as number went up, he let me be. \n\nI had 5 years of smooth sailing, loved the work, did a good job, etc. So it felt super out of left field when I started getting grief daily. Note that our online sales were better than ever and growing faster than ever too. The hassling got worse and worse until finally I was given an official disciplinary review for my poor performance. \n\nWanna know the craziest part? Remember how I was the ONLY employee under my manager, the one who built the entire department from scratch? Well, a week after I got that disciplinary review for poor performance, my manager won employee of the year because of his department‚Äôs outstanding performance. He got a big bonus lol. \n\nGot called in the next week for another disciplinary review where they tried to push me into a lower pay position (I already got paid well below market standard, like half) and I quit on the spot lol. Sent him all the data I had, updated all my contacts and consultants to email him going forward, sent him a text file with something like 80 or 90 usernames/passwords for the various tools, apps, etc I was handling, and just walked out. \n\nBut it‚Äôs not all bad. I got a call a year later and they were still trying to fill the position and wanted me to come back. Apparently they couldn‚Äôt find anyone who would do 3 jobs for shit pay. That was the perkiest ‚Äúno‚Äù I‚Äôve ever delivered.\n\nI don‚Äôt know the best solution in your case, but if possible you should try to get them to fire you. I was too disgusted to stay so I missed out on a lot of benefits. But that was the best decision for me. You gotta find the best solution for you. Best of luck!",

On paper - you never argued.\n\nHowever - i do think independence is a normal trait of a senior. It does factor into your work AND getting stuff done.

It may or may not be the \"right\" decision for the project, but in no way is being on a team that doesn't have the time or energy to onboard you, your fault. Business can be cold, and management pressure basically squeezes you as a tech lead: you give the managers what they want, or you're out, so when someone questions the plan, or tries to bring new ideas, it's difficult to entertain those ideas unless they are bringing new information to the table that change assumptions, and the right time is during planning.\n\nThus, don't let any of this be a reflection on you! It just doesn't work out on some teams. Maybe that's your fault, maybe it's the team or companies fault, but does it really matter? I don't think so. This is a stressful job that asks a lot out of us, and the what you experienced happens to a lot of devs, and has happened to me on both sides of the table.\n\nDust off your resume, and get ready to apply. 3 years is good experience, if you focus on applications, you'll likely find something else.",

So it's really not uncommon for a fiscal quarter to approach and for them to lay off staff to compensate for venture capital shortfalls or profitability overestimates.\n\nAnother thing is that junior and intern level staff are a drain on precious resources the start-up cannot afford to bleed out. So, even though they do hire newer programmers, they're *hoping* they can get a new mid or potential leadership candidate for minimal cost. They usually can afford to keep rolling that slot machine every few seasons. So start-ups and consultancies are (often but not always) incredibly hard places to start out, despite their need to hire to appeal to investors or receive grants for training.",

It might have been a job I really wanted, but I know the company likely isn‚Äôt going anywhere and there will be opportunities in the future when I‚Äôm more prepared or just having a better day. I know it probably sounds annoying to hear right now but I would try to use this as motivation instead of a loss. High-pressure interviewing is a skill we rarely get to actually practice but is so critical in actually getting a job.\n\n\nOn the more practical side I would spend some time doing a retro on the interview. Sit down and jot some notes about what you wish you did better. What do you think your issues were? Was there a concept you needed to understand better? Did you jump into the question too quickly? Were you just nervous and blanked? Then you can come up with an action plan for how to move forward, and focus on your weaknesses so you‚Äôll be more prepared next time. \n\n\nGood luck, it only takes one offer to have a job!",

I don't have a clearance, so I can't speak to the cleared side, but in public trust realm, I have not loved government contracting. There's no one specific thing I can really point to because all of my experiences have been so different. I'll just that that I enjoyed working the private sector and even state government's more.\n\nOne benefit of working for government contractors though is job is kind of expected, so after you get a few years of experience under your belt, you have lots of opportunities to get a new job with a big pay bump. And if you land in a shithole, you can usually find an exit by just being open to new opportunities on linkedIn.\n\nAs for the weather, yeah summers can be swampy. DC was literally built on a swamp. It's not the most humid place I've been, but it's close. The other thing is if you are from a place that gets real winter, we have no idea what to do in snow. We talk about snow storms that the midwest would barely register as storms, like hurricanes. A couple of inches of snow at rush hour can cripple our roadways. To be fair, so can rain, and clear skies...basically, whatever the weather, someone infront of you has never seen it before and is freaking out.\n\nDriving here is also pretty terrible in general. We collect the world's worst drivers and put them on overcrowded roads. The metro is fine. I used it when I worked in DC. I didn't love it when I had to drive to the Vienna station, pay for parking and then ride into the city. I've never did that math, but I do wonder is I should have just paid for parking downtown. \n\nThe cost of living is also quite high. Rent and house prices have been obscene since the 90s. Laidoff federal workers choosing to leave might make a difference, but it will be relatively small.\n\nOn the other hand, the public schools tend to be good, and because we have so many bored government workers around, there are more types of recreation than you would think. The choice of activities I have within an hour of my house is insane. They're all crowded, and none of them are world class, but still, if I want to take up a hobby outside my house, there's some place relatively close where I can go. \n\nTL;DR; NoVa is fine. I can't argue for it over any of the other locations you mentioned. Truth be told, if my wife had an opportunity in Chicago and wanted to move closer to here family, I'd probably be excited about the move.",

In recent times I was so stressed that I was considering harming myself beyond repair just to get out of this.\n\n\nBut I overcame that by realizing that I am still in a good position to save a lot of money because I do earn fairly well for my age, so at this point I have some runway to not be under the bridge if I happen to be laid off.\n\n\nI still get stressed but not as intense as I did before, I understand that being more laid back will result in less job opportunity - maybe - but I am way better off this way and if I happen to never find a job again in the industry I know I can still survive with something else.\n\n\nSo I would say it's a matter of perspective",

Sometime just stepping away from work is not enough -- that stops actively draining your battery, but inherently does nothing to recharge it.\n\nI can't just take PTO. I need to take PTO and either:\n\n1. Have a fun getaway with the wife/kids (costs range from \"gas money\" to \"whole ass resort package\")\n2. Work on a house project to completion (costs range from \"$0\" to a \"whole ass deck\")\n3. Work on a code project to completion (pretend I'm still a developer for a bit)\n4. Fuck off into the wilderness for a week or two\n\nThen my battery is fully charged, and I'm good to go for several months. When I'm feeling burned out, I use my PTO or talk with my boss to see if it's OK to step away from \"important manager stuff\" to pursue #3 for a little bit. Then I get paid to recharge and didn't need to spend my PTO.\n\nAlso, >5 months worth of expenses in a savings account at all times. I've worked some stressful jobs inside and outside of CS, and the peace of mind that comes with \"I can quit whenever I want and my family will not starve\" is priceless. Get into those positive financial habits now, because it absolutely does not become easier with commitments like a marriage, mortgage, kids, indigent parents/friends, etc. Those commitments will find you as you age.",

I typically try to find roles where I am really interested in what I am working on, then I am naturally going to want to work on it, it‚Äôs not like doing a chore.¬†\n\nThe one big difference I would say is the people I worked with at the startup were way more fun to work with. We all became good friends and still keep in touch. The culture at the big tech company I‚Äôm at now is not like that at all, it‚Äôs more like the coworkers are competition and everyone is trying to outwork the next guy. That is really the worst aspect of it, the culture is more like a death march than a bunch of friends working on fun stuff together. I feel like it‚Äôs all due to the ‚Äúpip‚Äù culture, and I don‚Äôt really get why they do it.¬†\n\nOne final thing I‚Äôll add is even though I work a lot, I still feel like I get plenty of free time. It‚Äôs not like anyone makes you sit in the office from 9-5, if I have a doctors appointment or just want to work from home in the morning and go in for my meetings in the afternoon or whatever, nobody really cares. The schedule is really up to me as long as I get my work done.¬†",

Else go for free while working when your employer pays for it. Though the only employer I know that pays is the US government.\n\n>I make only $40k/year.\n\nWell that is shit pay. MS program looking better now all of a sudden. MS \"resets\" to look again for internships and move up. UMD isn't elite tier but it's decent like you're saying.\n\nI guess you can argue this either way. You could very well have no job at graduation and be in serious debt, or you could jump up to fair pay.\n\nI don't know why you would go through applying for an MS application without applying to new CS jobs. In normal cost of living, $60k base salary for entry level is low but not terrible. At 3 YoE, you're above entry level and therefore have less competition but can still apply for it. Then OMSCS at Georgia Tech is online and legit and very cheap. No funding other than beer money by being a TA after your first year.",

For example: Firing somebody is a pretty tough thing to do if you think a lot about it (will this person ever get a job again? will their wife leave them? what about their kids? etc.). So there's a definite need to develop the skills that help you navigate the really heavy facets of the job, which may manifest as creating a \"mask\" that you wear to get through the hard times.\n\nFor me, I'm just open and transparent as much and as frequently as possible. When I walk into a hard conversation the participant is typically well aware of what the talk is about, so it's just a few words for clarity and they go on their way.\n\nI'm sure plenty of people who've worked with me over the years hate my leadership style and would consider me to be aloof or a total dick. That's cool with me, I'm not overly concerned with being liked by everyone. \"You can't win 'em all\" as they say.",

You‚Äôre drowning and the first thing to do is to give yourself some air. My suggestion would be to start by carving out some time for mental decompression every day - it can be something as simple as taking 15-20 mins everyday for a walk or workout or just sitting and staring out the window. But no phones, no emails, no bringing a family member along to make this time about them- this is your time to spend some time with yourself so that you can process your own emotions.\n\nNext, I‚Äôd focus on the positives of the situation. To me, it looks like things may not be as bad as they seem - to you it feels like everyone is weighing down on you, but in reality everyone is probably as stressed as you are and they are just passing that along to you, as they are to everyone. Second, no matter how bad it seems, it‚Äôs a temporary situation and it will change. It feels like the end of the world right now because you are in the eye of the storm, but it will pass. Have faith in that if it feels like everything else is failing.\n\nYour employability may also be better than you feel. Even if it‚Äôs a niche industry, I‚Äôm sure there are skills you have that are transferable, and there may be opportunities in places you haven‚Äôt looked, like sister industries and customers where they may not be doing exactly what you are doing but your expertise could be valuable. It might be worth reaching out to mentors in the industry to figure out your blind spots in terms of employability.\n\nHope it works out, and remember, this too shall pass",

There is really no movement right now due to some policy things Cheeto Caligula is doing.  \n\nDo be fair, I'm not at my best right now due to stress, and my coping mechanisms aren't working for once. I think the big thing I struggle with is that when they switched to doing daily huddles rather than bi-weekly project updates, it felt like every employee was getting grilled in their work and I've had to push stats to appease them that weren't true to keep the peace and then work weekends to make it up.  I'll be honest about it, but I don't think that's going to save me.\n\nI get this feeling in my chest it's all going down hill and I can't peddle fast enough to prevent it. And I can't jump ship either without the next thing lined up and it takes time that might not be there.\n\nI remind myself I have the next egg to sit for some time but I'm just not someone that gets fired or pipped.  It's hard on my sense of self knowing this is out of my hands.",

They can't replace you in your own words given your domain expertise  and already laid off a bunch people who you guys need pick slack for.

Alot of times, you just need reach right ears. Not all time, but even in harsh deadlines and toxic envs sometimes their is one person who has power say stop and let's replan vs steam roll ahead into absolute failure sound like. I would explore any unturned stone with discretion if possible, bc you sound like even if you stick it iut project is doomed to fail. \n\n3. Eod, 1 and 2 fails. You need kinda get over the ego stage and just accept you tried your best than position yourself for the future.

I would just quiet quit and aggressively apply jobs.\n\n I can tell you alternative as its not great from personal experience is much worse. Depression worsens, weight gain, lose your hobbies bc dont have time, become more shut in as mental healthy declines, prob lose some friends from lack time, fatigue, and constant reminder of deadlines burden you all you want do is sleep, etc.",

I saw someone else say he‚Äôs becoming a high school history teacher (fully by choice, he loves history).¬†\n\nI worked at a large contracting company for a little bit. They had a boot camp where they trained people, then tried to staff them. I want to warn you, don‚Äôt let your skills get rusty. They let everyone in the boot camp go (they were on the bench), then some opportunities arose months later due to some positions opening up. Basically every candidate bombed their interview. They had forgotten everything.¬†\n\nPeople will talk about luck, but I think a huge portion of luck is being ready when those random opportunities arise. You‚Äôre trying to always put yourself in the best position possible.¬†\n\nGood luck. It‚Äôs always OK to step away and take a break.¬†",

It's mostly a lose-lose proposition for them at the point where you've already left and began work for their client. If the company also had some kind of non-solicitation agreement with your agency, that's not really _your_ problem.\n\nI was in a similar position to you and the non-solicitation clause did not prevent me from joining the client company (a global 500).

If you‚Äôre not getting job experience (which feels like one of the only things on your resume that actually matters), I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad idea at all to start training for a potentially different field.\n\nUnfortunately though I‚Äôm not sure how much safer EE really is. EE has been plagued by excessive outsourcing the same as CS has for years. The nature of the work makes it easy to just outsource a specific project, get a working design and never talk to the designer again. Additionally I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs immune to LLMs taking over, although it won‚Äôt happen as quickly as CS since it‚Äôs not just pure text that needs to be spit out. \n\nThat said if you‚Äôre financially able to potentially work contract jobs or spend some time developing skills, it‚Äôs not that bad of an idea. I don‚Äôt want to discourage you cause I understand how you feel exactly, but there‚Äôs something to be said about working in a field you‚Äôre passionate about. On one hand it‚Äôs obviously more fulfilling, but on the other hand you risk burnout and losing something that could have been a lifelong hobby or passion.

If you're going to shit tier then transfer up. University prestige matters for internships and first job at graduation, then maybe never again. #1 or #2 best in your state is plenty prestigious. In-person career fairs are how I got all my opportunity.\n\nHalf the CS advice is wrong because it's by students and cosplayers who never got hired in CS.\n\nOn your own time, you can learn tech stacks. Is a reasonable idea. Recruiters don't care about and won't look at your GitHub. I have never listed mine. If you can hold a conversation and talk through the programming language and common software it uses, you're in good shape. You still have to get to the interview stage and the #1 way to help that is land an internship. At this point, your grades matter. Competition is fierce. Be willing to relocate and sublease.\n\nMost jobs are in 1 of C# or Java or TypeScript/JavaScript, with Python for support. Learn a database such as Postgres and writing CRUD to it. I'd hope your classes cover this. Don't try to learn everything. Look at job descriptions and see what they ask for. You don't need 30/30 requirements but a few are mandatory. The joke is you need 5 YoE in everything and it's not completely a joke.",

The summer is almost over and bigger companies will begin opening their 2026 summer internship roles. Start applying. Go to career fairs, school events, and as much as I hate it, cold network with the occasional LinkedIn recruiter. It works sometimes. Your opportunity to find an internship only expires when May 2026 hits, so literally just start right now. Internships are the best thing you can do as an undergrad.\n\n2. Projects. Yes, I always hated when people said that. 'Just learn'. Not that easy, especially when you get trapped in tutorial hell. Follow a couple of tutorials and then try to make something on your own. Go find a 'To-Do' list tutorial if you want to do web development, go find a course if there's something specific you want to learn.\n\nI didn't do anything...I mean ANYTHING until I was already a junior and I think I'm fine. Go network, apply for internships (or apprenticeships or fellowships or whatever) and follow some tutorials.",
