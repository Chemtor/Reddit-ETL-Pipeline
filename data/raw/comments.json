Instagram just deprecated their “plays” and “impressions” metrics and replaced them with a new metric called “views”.\n\n“Plays” was already a replacement for an older metric called “video_views”, and “plays” measured initial plays on Reels only. The new “views” metric includes replays. There was another metric deprecated called something like “reels_aggregated_plays” which included replays on Reels and therefore matched the new “views” metric.\n\nAlso new “views” populates for post types that traditionally wouldn’t get “video_views” because they aren’t technically videos: think carousels, images. New “views” are basically “impressions” but they’re higher than impressions for reasons we don’t really understand yet.\n\nFor almost a decade now we’ve been charged with creating cross-platform data sets that measure total video views. How do we do this when the metric you’ve always used for video views no longer exists, and views happen for more than just video? What we’re saying was a video view in March 2025 is not the same as what we’re saying was a video views in May 2025\n\nMy point is: this sucks ass. How are you going to validate these changes and explain the data to stakeholders? It’s great that you’re working with sources with well-defined schemas, but social media platforms do not keep things consistent for long, always introducing and redefining metrics and post types. Keep all the columns.",

We have on-prem data, some data is in Oracle or db2, and my division mostly lives in Synapse.\n\nThe Synapse data is often pulled from those other sources (via Synapse Pipelines or stored procedures), cleaned (usually in SQL, sometimes in pandas), and finally dumped into a table.\n\nNotice - there’s no bronze layer. I think this is the definition of ETL since we transform before we load. I could be wrong.\n\nWhat’s nice about this workflow: it minimizes costs and it reduces cognitive burden since, there’s fewer intermediate tables.\n\nWhat stinks about this workflow: it’s hard to reason about data lineage and there’s little to no audit trail. Where does this variable come from? Have to dig deep in some low level db just to find the source. If a table churns out questionable data, where did the mistake happen? Is it in the transformation logic, or was there some miscommunication with the source table? Again, tricky to understand. \n\nSo while having a dumping ground for raw  data seems redundant and can introduce extra expenses, sometimes it’s worth it. I believe that pattern is called ELT, since you load the ugly raw data into a new source system before cleaning it.\n\nAnother benefit of the bronze layer or ELT approach is that it can reduce the number of ad hoc queries against the low level transactional database, which slows everything down. And having the raw data under the same roof as your data warehouse’s clean data, again, opens up new forms of exploratory analysis.\n\nA nice compromise, instead of having permanent intermediate tables, is to have trunc and load tables that are refreshed at regular intervals. That way the data doesn’t eat up so many costs, but there’s still an audit trail for testing and observing data lineage.",

        "body": "Ways I would tackle it:\n\n1. Denormalized counters in your post record (small scale)\n\nYou add integer columns like `comments_count`, `likes_count` directly on your posts table.\n\nWhenever someone adds or removes a comment (or like), you increment/decrement that column instead of re‑scanning all comments.\n\nMost relational databases (Postgres, MySQL) can do an atomic `UPDATE posts SET comments_count = comments_count + 1 WHERE id = ?` cheaply, especially when that column is in memory.\n\nThis would be my first pick given you can ship this in minutes with zero infrastructure beyond your main database.\n\n2. Sharded or distributed counters (mid scale)\n\nFor “hot” posts with millions of comments/likes - think celebrities, viral content etc., a single counter can become a write hotspot.\n\nYou break it into N shards:\n\n    UPDATE comment_counter_shards\n       SET shard_count = shard_count + 1\n     WHERE post_id = ? AND shard_id = rand_between(1, N)\n\nTo read the total, you sum over those N shards. N is tuned (often 4–16) so no single row fights over locks.\n\nThis solution pays off only when your single‑row updates actually become a bottleneck (once you hit sustained write contention). Until then its probably an overkill.\n\n3. In‑memory caching (Redis, Memcached, etc.)\n\nMaintain the “current” counts in a fast key‑value store. On each write you atomically INCR or DECR the Redis key (e.g. post:123:comments).\n\nFeed readers pull from cache, falling back to the database only if the cache miss occurs.\n\nEach 1 & 2 solutions could be combined with this method for low-latency reads.\n\nI am about to drive - lemme think of other ways, I will edit and add to this post if something else comes up.\n\nUPDATE: Some more thoughts:\n\nTo keep write latency low, counters could update asynchronously (e.g. via a message queue).\n\nYou accept sub‑second lag in the displayed count in exchange for high throughput (which for non-YMYL stuff like like/comment count is acceptable).\n\nAlso worth noting, there are specialized data stores with native counters like Cassandra and Bigtable from Google. They support atomic counter columns across distributed nodes, so you offload the complexity of sharding and locking.\n\nBut if you are at that stage and its your own service, you probably made it and I want your job :)\n\nAnyways, its weekend.

You just need to define a function and output a Polars Dataframe, and Dagster does the rest. This what you built is an asset (important to understand why Dagster is different to other orchestrators).\n\nThat asset can have dependencies with other Dagster assets. And what can be an asset? dbt models, Airbyte-generated tables, etc. (anything that can materialize data in a \\[table, file, memory, etc\\] is an asset) so when you need build N-asset and its parents (because Dagster respects the order) is awesome.

        "body": "I'd say that an Inmon approach (at least originally, the man keeps evolving his ideas and publishing new books) compares better as a data architecture, much like a data mesh, more than Kimball (at least when he started, that guy kept on expanding his concepts as well).\n\nInmon's DW design favored more or less 3 data layers:\n- A raw layer, that started as a landing zone and eventually evolved to an \"operational data store\". Originally is way quite simple, but an ODS was supposed to provide operational level reporting capabilities, with even near real-time if possible (it was quite visionary when proposed in the 90s);\n- A Data Warehouse layer, which was supposed to have a fully integrated view of the business for analytical purposes. This matched mostly his definition: \"subject-oriented, non-volatile, integrated, time-variant collection of data\". The DW layer is rarely, if ever, accessed by BI tools or end users. It is the single source of truth that feeds the specific databases (next bullet) supporting analytic and decision nerds. As such, it tends to be more normalized (not really full 3NF, but in that direction), as this would make it more reusable for different sets of requirements - including future ones.\n- Data marts: these are tightly scoped to the needs of specific use cases. For reporting and BI, it's common to model those as Kimball star schemas; for data science, other formats, even files, are possible. For specific reports, it could be a very custom thing.\n\nThis actually is the source for a medallion architecture, and also became a full data architecture before Kimball came up with the concept of a DW using \"conformed dimensions\". I built quite a few DWs using Inmon's approach, and I can tell you they evolve well and survive a lot. The main challenges are:\n- Figuring out a good priority for which domains/subjects to build first. It's no use trying to model the whole DW layer before delivering something, but people still try that.\n- Knowing how to capture a business in its entirety in a data model. Eventually, as you iterate, you'll find inconsistencies, redundancies, things no one thought about, politics, etc. Solving those to one common model is hard; letting them pass reduces the value of the DW layer over time, putting g the entire architecture in check;\n- Compound effort of having data go through 3 layers (or more) before delivering value. Again, this is people just assuming they have to adopt and build it all before any value is delivered. My approach was to first do a high level business mapping in domains to identify opportunities and prioritize. The first 2-3 deliveries usually had very light landing and a straightforward middle layer model, generating stars was straightforward, fast and cheap. As the platform grew, complexity would be added but not as a burden - it is a way to actually represent the business and deliver higher-level analytics. The kind that needs cross domain analysis, decision and optimization. Doing that on top of starts is incredibly harder (been there, done that).\n\nInmon kept evolving his design, addressing data quality, unstructured data, real-time and others, but he lost importance as the world moved to cloud and Hadoop - even though he published about those and his designs were perfectly applicable there. It's more that everything pre-cloud and pre-agile was sort of left behind by a new generation.\n\nEdit:typos",

        "body": "> orbits/predictions that would require going through the entire database more than once to establish relationships between planets/stars and calculate distances based on multiple columns and making sub queries based on the results\n\nThis aspect sounds like you want to step out of SQL for some steps, or at least generate intermediate tables. Generating a subquery based on the results of another query isn't really how CTEs work - a CTE just creates a view or 'virtual table' that you can query from. The 'going through the entire database more than once' sounds like you want to do some kind of iterative work, where you want to save the results at each step and move on.\n\nThis doesn't necessitate using a particular DB, but you might want to think about how you would approach some of these things in another language. Using Python, for instance, lets you make use of many different tools that work well together, it will let you take an imperative approach to calculating things, and you'll be able to easily write output data to files and review them using csv/jsonl/parquet formats.\n\nYou would also be able to set up long running processes to be done incrementally. Say you create a list of all systems 'A' to calculate the distance to all other systems 'B' - if this would take a long time, you can store a table with which 'A' systems have been done. Then your imperative program can just find the next 'A' system to calculate, and do the calculations for that. This sort of chunking might make processing more resilient to timeouts or memory issues.\n\n> if making multiple smaller tables with a few columns (5-10) or a single one with all columns (30-40) would be best\n\nIf you land on columnar storage like parquet, or duckdb's internal storage, then it doesn't matter how many columns you have. Their data layout means that all the data for a column is stored together, so it can completely skip over columns you don't need. The general tradeoff with columnar systems is they often make it a bit slower to pick out individual values. So if your main way of using the data is to grab out the data for a specific system, this isn't as efficient.\n\nIf you have a row-based store then you might be better served with multiple tables if you can organise columns into groups that are often used together. For example if coordinates aren't often used in conjuction with other columns, but you want to do a lot of work comparing coordinates, then you could split that off to its own table. If all the tables share the same primary key, and you make sure they are all indexed the same, it should be fine to perform joins between these tables. This is likely a relatively small optimisation, since it really just makes disk reads a bit more efficient.\n\n> The best database option that would basically be read only...\n\nThis mostly means that something based on columnar-storage will be fine. You aren't updating rows, so you don't need anything transactional. It doesn't preclude row-based systems either, so essentially everything is open to you.\n\nIf postgres is working for you, just keep it in there. That's fine.\n\nSQLite probably won't work - it doesn't have a compressed format, and you'll likely run into issues with the large data volume relative to disk size.\n\nIf most of what you are doing is running through lots of data at once, then you could convert the tables to parquet files and query with something like DuckDB, Polars, or Daft. Each of those also make it easier to script with python and exchange data from an sql processing model to an imperative one in python. Daft may have a benefit that it has a built-in method to spread execution to multiple processes on your machine, so if something goes oom it can recover and retry, and can spill intermediate steps to disk.\n\nOr, as others have mentioned, you could add an extension for duckdb to get data via postgres.\n\n---\n\nIn general, I'd leave things in postgres for now and see if you can point things like DuckDB at it, and see how their processing model works for you. Polars [can connect to a database](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.read_database.html) and [so can Daft](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/integrations/sql/). If you're going to hit OOM issues it will happen in this processing step regardless of how the data is stored, so if you try out a few different processing engines working off of the existing postgres data, you might find what works for you.\n\nIf any of these tools work for you, then you might consider shifting the data to parquet format as it may be smaller to store and more efficient to read. Every one of these can write data out to parquet ([duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/file_formats/parquet_export.html), [polars](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.LazyFrame.sink_parquet.html), [daft](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/api/dataframe/#daft.DataFrame.write_parquet).",

Postgres for sure is one of those, but for your use case you'd want an Analytic (OLAP) Database so you could use Clickhouse.\n\nDoing rankings is a typical analytic task with a window function. Establishing relationships, the full table scan part is just part and parcel of what a traditional database does but you going in and actually mapping the relationships you could use a CTE. Better yet would be something like dbt (data build tool).\n\nNow I'm not saying you'll be accessing all 225G's at once in which case *maybe*  you won't hit your 32G of system memory limit. I'm not sure queries you do plan on running. But to be on the safe side just use a traditional analytic server like Clickhouse and if it turns out that the queries you end up running don't have huge joins or aren't working with tables that are 60gigs at a time in size then you can just use DuckDB.\n\nEdit: How you end up modeling this data and what queries you run against it might be a separate issue. I think the baseline technical aspect is to get you up and running. \n\nActually one thing I hadn't considered is you can just keep running everything in Postgres since it's already in it, and then use DuckDB with the postgres extension known as pg\\_duck\n\n[https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html)",

All in a tool that could be easily updated, distributed, and used by nontechnical stakeholders. This was my first analyst gig too, so don’t expect anything too cool—it was 100% locally ran Python that generated an Excel file daily.\n\nIt was an Excel workbook with a summary sheet and another sheet for every country’s detail page. It used Excel formulas like HYPERLINK() to let users conveniently jump around the thing. Using Python allowed me to move a lot of the calculation backward into the Python step though, so I could basically bootstrap every cell with hardcoded values in its functions—no dynamic lookup stuff needed. It made the excel unmaintainable, sure, but it was quick as hell despite being big as hell. The python was maintainable, and I think that was the point. Excel was just the interface, getting generated every day from scratch.\n\nThe Python script would connect to like 8 different APIs (a corporate db, several Google APIs, Reddit, Meta, and two porn networks) and generate a fresh report every morning. It was actually easier to regenerate the whole thing every day, than to try updating any single copy. The sources maintained their own history, and I just pulled it in every single day. Worked like a charm. I don’t work there anymore, but I often think about how I hope they’ve upgraded that thing by now (assuming it’s still around).",

It contains the relevant schemas, SLAs, who’s who, DQ rules, logic rules, etc in one consolidated form. Even better, it’s agreed by all parties that this is what the solution is. \n\nUnfortunately it still requires a lot of maturity to get right and people still try to shortcut it, but it’s definitely an improvement on DEs trying to piece together the holistic requirement from multiple docs.",

I've been there, battling inconsistent naming and typos like it's whack-a-mole. \n\nIn my experience, a multi-pronged approach works best:\n\n1. Upstream communication: Work with the manual entry team to establish data quality guidelines.\n2. Data cleaning pipelines: Build robust ETL processes to standardize and clean data at ingestion.\n3. Fuzzy matching algorithms: Implement more sophisticated matching techniques (e.g., Levenshtein distance).\n4. Data quality monitoring: Set up automated checks to flag potential issues early.\n\nIt's a journey, but these strategies have saved my sanity in similar situations.

The biggest problem I had like this was cleaning addresses around the world. There were about 400 million of them. They were almost always manually input, inconsistent and had tons of dupicates and semi-duplicates. In addition to that fun, the rules that constituted a \"good\" address changed from country to country. The acid test for the US was the addresses in Atlanta, GA. There are dozens of valid variations of Peachtree. Some countries, such as Switzerland, had the individual/company as part of a valid address. This didn't even begin to address misspellings and incorrect abbreviations.\n\nIt is solvable and straightforward but not easy. You have to use different techniques for different problems in the data set. Sometimes a lookup against existing data is needed. Sometimes it is a correction table. \n\nIn this case, it required brut force data cleansing using SQL (so I could treat things as sets and get some performance). I was able to run through the entire set in about 25 minutes. Once the bulk of the data was cleansed, I started using the Google mapping API on the front end to validate addresses. This started making the problem a bit better.",

        "body": "Wait, am I understanding correctly: did you set up Airflow such that it is pulling DAG code from multiple repos? That's what the \"git submodules\" thing makes me believe is going on.\n\nMy advice: do not do that. Unless you have literally thousands of engineers, **just do a monorepo for Airflow DAGs**. There are few reasons to make it more complicated than that and there are a lot of upsides to the monorepo in terms of how real world projects develop, in addition to just relieving yourself of the deployment headache (which is the #1 reason). Those other reasons are:\n\n- a single commit can touch multiple DAGs across multiple projects\n\n- projects can share Airflow-level utils\n\n- sync dependencies in Airflow runtime\n\n- external DAG dependencies\n\n- easier to run a local version of the whole instance if your Airflow isn't dependent on CI-specific things to glue things together\n\n- less magic\n\nSo save yourself the headache and just do the monorepo.\n\nFrom there, deployment is very simple. Every major Airflow deployment method, including the Helm Chart but also MWAA and Astronomer, just mounts the `dags/` folder as a volume, and so deployments that do not introduce new dependencies are as simple as updating the folder.\n\nExternal systems that get called by Airflow can be in their own separate repos, but know where the dividing line is between those systems and Airflow as an orcestrator: KubernetesOperator, CloudRunCreateJobOperator, EcsTaskRunOperator. Yes modifying the `argv` of a container's command requires two commits across two separate repos, but that's not a big deal (cross-DAG commits are way more annoying when they're cross-repo; within-DAG commits being cross-repo is really not that annoying. The monorepo really wants to optimize for that case to be easier).\n\nAlso, never ever use git submodules. You can either take my advice right here right now, or you can waste your time and learn the hard way.",

If they're large enough, you save them as s3 objects in their own right. If they're small, you send them to something like Kinesis Firehose, which will automatically buffer objects up to 15mins/300MB and then save them out to s3.\n\nIf you want to track where you are up to, and you are running all this in a single process, you can just have a json object in s3 that you overwrite with the currently active data, so that if something stops or crashes you can pick up from the last request. If you have multiple concurrent processes or it is updating very fast, you can store it all in a tiny DynamoDB against a particular key.\n\n---\n\nMicrobatching ingestion into a single duckdb database sounds off. You replace objects in s3, so every write will be a full rewrite of the file. If you wanted to make data like this available to duckdb for processing, you would be writing append-only to some other file format that duckdb could read.\n\nFor remote data instances with updates like this, you might use duckdb as the processing engine, but you would be using an open table format like deltalake or iceberg to allow you to do write transactions on the data in a way that is more amenable to the way object storage works.",

Always think, what you want to show, when building a star schema - and always shoot for a star, when you have a snowflake (dimension connected to another dimension), you need to reason yourself, if it's the correct approach.\n\n\nTry to have a discussion with some LLM (chat GPT...) it will guide you, but ask questions about why...\n\nAnd also, when in doubt, go to the elementary source: https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/\n\n\nOr, easier to consume:https://www.proserveit.com/blog/guide-to-dimensional-modelling",

        "body": "You may want to check out Ralph Kimball's data model book as that's the bible on this stuff.  You are way overcomplicating this.  If your descriptive concept has a 1:many relationship to a fact table (meaning only one description is related to a single record) then you directly join that dimension to the fact.  Title would be an example of that as a movie only has one title.  A many to many relationship would use a bridge table, in this case people.  There are many actors in each movie.  Generally you want to avoid many to many, but it's useful  for some cases like that.  I usually put a fact, or column to aggregate, in my factless fact tables as it's often easier to deal with in BI tools, but it's optional.  Y\n\nou also want to consolidate your dimensions so that related information is not in a separate table.  Title, title type and title season are all related, or do not differ across the rows of the fact.  A movie will always have been produced in the same season, have the same category, director or whatever.  If you wanted to represent movie revenue in your fact by region, then you would have a separate dimension for region as the same title would have several records in the fact with different regions and different revenue amounts.  \n\nHigh level looking at this I think you have a fact table, date dimension, title dimension and actor dimension with a bridge.  Might be a bit more complex if I thought through it, but looks pretty simple.",

It is HIGHLY unlikely that you will actually have weather information by route/problem.

I would find the mid-point for a given crag (or section if it’s really big or they are far apart etc) and just map that weather prediction by “area”. That will simplify things A LOT.

Learning from other people is a crutch and always will be.  I always thought in my previous career \"well, I'll just learn from this person until I can stand on my own two feet, and everything will be fine\".  It never happened.  I never improved and ended up hating my job because I became more experienced on paper, but in reality, my knowledge didn't correlate with my experience.  And it showed.\n\nWhen it came to DE, I taught myself and found it liberating not feeling like I was stuck, waiting for somebody else to hold my hand all the time.  I could just look at a piece of work, play around, get a feel for it and then continue from there.  Every time I learnt something new, it stuck much harder because I discovered it myself rather than somebody saying, \"Make sure you sort out XYZ\" before I had time to think about it.\n\nOn top of that, it's another incentive to go ahead and start building instead of another excuse to sit on social media all day.\n\nMy recommendation is to stop chasing the ideas of other people and develop your own.  Knowing what's good and what's bad comes with time and it's really common with beginners that they want to be perfect from the get go, so go out of their way to try and seek knowledge from people who claim to know more.  Making mistakes and being imperfect is part of learning.  I'm a firm believer you don't need a mentor and most people who say you need a mentor are, ironically, mentors.\n\n> Have any of you found value in attending data engineering or analytics conferences?\n\nMostly surface level.  I went to a large one in Europe and my manager joked at the time \"Remember: you are all happily employed\" because it was a running joke that the conferences are just for companies to poach from other companies.  I enjoyed the community aspect, learnt a few things.  Won some competitions.  Getting paid to have fun in a new city is fun.\n\n> Any learning paths or courses that helped you understand more than just what works but also why?\n\nHonestly? Teach yourself, be willing to learn (as in, be wrong and improve rather than be wrong and convinced you'll be right the next time with exactly the same approach).  I'd also say don't chase tools, learn concepts instead as it saves you so much time.  Be curious.  Be patient - there is no other way to put in 10,000 hours other than putting in 10,000 hours.",

At each major stage, you can insert lightweight validation gates to catch issues early, before pushing into the next phase.\n\nYou can use Soda Core for this (open source). It lets you define checks as YAML files and trigger them in Python or SQL-based workflows. Example:\n\n    checks for model_inputs:\n      - row_count > 10000\n      - missing_count(client_score) = 0\n      - min(transaction_amount) >= 0\n\nYou can run these after data ingestion, data transformation, and post-modeling (e.g. “no negative predictions” or “R² above threshold”).\n\nIf you’re curious, I just wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kmeqz2/lightweight_e2e_pipeline_data_validation_using/) about this type of lightweight validation using Python and YAML — not specific to ML models, but the idea applies.\n\nHappy to share how others have structured this if you want to go deeper.",

When the request comes in the lambda writes a request to our SQS queue\n3. Fargate listens to the SQS event and executes a dbt run where each variable specified gets passed as args into Jinja e.g \n```\ndbt run --vars '{\"key\": \"value\"}\n```\nWhere the vars here are those that were POSTed to your api endpoint.

You create a dag that compiles and run your model and exposes the orchestrator api.\n\nBut it might be to complex.\n\nI would probably create a fast api app and expose its api ( secure it and so on).\nCalling your api would create a background task that compiles the dbt project and run it. Not using the background task could make the request timeout coz it take some time.\n\nAnd this could be your biggest problem: this would take a lot of time.\nIs it possible to compile your model in different variations and then use correct version based on the columns in the request? \n\nIf not the case- try catching the queries so if an user calls with columns a and b. You compile the models and save the compiled model in a map. Colums as a key. When next time the same user calls the api with the same columns they do not go trough the pain of compiling it. \n\nAnd as one suggest previously wrap the dbt in a service with the queue. So it work on one request at a time.\n\nLots of additional questions could be asked but it seems like nice interesting task.",

One thing that’s worked is using a single Delta table with a version or snapshot column. You can tag each row with client and version info, so you don’t need to spin up new tables all the time. Then, just filter by those columns when users need to access a specific version\n\nTable snapshots are basically just copies, so they’ll use about as much storage as making a new table. If you want to save space, sticking to a single table and partitioning or tagging by client/version is usually more efficient",

Keeping adapters pluggable while managing schema evolution can be tricky. I've seen Protobuf and Avro co-exist by employing a versioned API and maintaining translation layers for different formats. As the source schemas evolve, design your adapters to convert attributes by using version tags that can read old and new formats.   For handling backward compatibility, I’ve found success in employing a gradual deprecation strategy, where deprecated fields are flagged and eventually phased out after ensuring historical data doesn't rely on them. This requires robust logging and version tracking to maintain access to past sessions without breaking existing conversations. I've tried tools like HashiCorp's Consul for real-time schema sync, but DreamFactory is noteworthy for schema management when integrating multiple data sources into one cohesive setup. It's worth exploring how it can simplify your process for managing schema changes across SQL, NoSQL, and more.",

You’re trying to train your brain to think in abstractions, understand decomposition, generalization, managing complexity, logic, and structure. That’s what CS is for. That’s what good teaching is for. And no, you don’t need to build the next Minecraft, in fact trying to do that too early is gonna confuse you more.\n\nOn the other hand, if you really want to build something, being a app, a game or wathever, then code becomes the tool but not the subject. You’ll learn plenty by doing, that's for sure, but your brain is focused on making it work, not on understanding the system. The trap is thinking the second automatically teaches the first. Sometimes it does, with enough reflection. But often, it builds habits that are hard to unlearn later.\nIf you want to learn programming, keep it small, controlled, and concept-driven. Then build up.

Using a ternary lets you keep a block of all your property assignments that’s likely to fit on your screen and be easier to read and check off against a mapping spec. \n\nIn normal coding, I prefer if statements. The style should make the pattern obvious while skimming a thousand lines of unfamiliar code base.

It keeps the entire thing on one line just so that things don't look as messy and cluttered, and the presence of the operator itself tells you that we have a 1-liner going on here.\n\nIn other languages that don't have them, I still tend to prefer the 1-liner for the same reasons, but I also just feel weird about it because it's not as immediately apparently what's going on. I'll use some Free Pascal as an example, because that is unfortunately my favorite language to work with.\n\n  \nIn C/C++\n\n    // no ternary\n    if (X > Y) {\n      return X;\n    } else {\n      return Y;\n    }\n    \n    // ternary\n    return (X > Y) ?

In FPC and other language that don't have one, it's only very slightly more effort to figure out what's going on, but it still kinda rubs me the wrong way and I might want to just use the whole if..else block to make the intention more clear.\n\nAll that being said, it's basically all inconsequential and up to personal preference. I can't see getting upset over seeing multiple blocks of conditionals vs. multiple 1-liners.",

It produces a lot of reasonable looking code but it's like generative \"art\", looks great at first glance 100 metres away but doesn't really hold up to scrutiny.\n\nAt best it develops at an almost intermediate dev level both in code quality and understanding of the context. I use it to augment my auto complete and boilerplate stuff like unit tests but asking it to do much more than that is dubious at best and I usually regret it when I try because I end up just spending as much time refactoring it as I would just writing it correctly in the first place.\n\nI don't think we're going to see massive breakthroughs in coding LLMs and we're already getting diminishing returns. The limitation being that by design it's going to produce the most average code it's trained on and it's started to get trained on it's own buggy code.\n\nI maintain that in 5-10 years there will be a huge demand for senior engineers that understand coding because there will be a generation of vibe coders that don't know how to fix all the technical debt they created. Thankfully I'll be more or less retired.",

To completely hand over software development to AI means you are just automating automation, which gives you less control and specificity.\n\nThat said, for writing difficult algorithms or complex systems, AI may be used for most of that work in the future, the same way that chess engines can outplay humans.\n\nThe problem with AI coding right now is that it is simply based on large language models, not a formal system such as coding verification. for example, you can task large language models to play chess, but they constantly suggest illegal moves and while they can make some very clever moves, they also make incredibly stupid ones at times as well.\n\nAI coding will take off once the machine learning systems are based on rigorous formal descriptions of programming languages, not just general large language models.\n\nRight now I would argue the best uses of AI for coding is translating large code bases from one language to another, prototyping of very simple ideas, or embedding an AI system to allow users to prompt the text.\n\nThe problem is LLMs are very easy to apply to a wide variety of tasks, but LLMs aren't specifically tailored for programming, so just like LLMs are much worse than a chess engine, specifically designed for chess, there will likely be innovations for ai programming that aren't just \"feed this LLM a bunch of code and see what it can do.\"\n\nLLMs will continue to get better, but even before LLMs people created logical proof systems and formal verification tools that are much more specific to programming.\n\nI imagine a scenario where you just write the test cases and then the ai system generates the code and algorithms that can pass those test cases.",

Find the curriculum of what you want to learn on a university website. Find ressources to learn the topics (if they give the books used for the courses, buy them and study them). Ace the ressources (my goal was to absorb 100% of the content of those ressources. I deemed acceptable if I ended above 90%, with the last 10% me having understood the concept but maybe lacking excellent execution).  \n\n> without getting overwhelmed?  \n\nYou will get overwhelmed. It's normal. Learn to deal with that. You'll need discipline to stay on schedule (yes, build a schedule for your learning path), and a schedule slow enough so that you can consistently be 1 week ahead in case you stumble onto something difficult that requires 1 full week of research and work to grasp. It will happen.  \n\nSource: I did self-teach maths, statistics, and a bit of programming up to bachelor level (I think it's that equivalent in the US, 3 years into college), and managed to get accepted in a master's degree. This way I only did 2 years of university to get a master's degree worth on the job market + network from the university.  \nYes, I'm not fully self-taught, people may dismiss my experience as \"basically not self-taught\" if they want, but at least I'm transparent.  \n\nJust to add, going the self-taught route is much harder than going the university route. I did that because I couldn't afford to stop working for 5 years to get back into the job market with a decent job and I was super motivated.",

You need to learn by doing projects because projects by definition have an end. Tutorial Hell is like open world games, you can just keep going. \n\n1. What I did was to set myself projects which interested me that we adjacent to the kind of tasks I'd be doing in a job. In my case it was an analysing books to understand the relationships between characters. I also had other ideas around web-scraping for data journalism type use cases. \n\n Rabbit-holes are great and you should dive into them, but having a project tethers you to what you're trying to achieve and you can drag yourself back because you start to feel guilty that you've not made progress. If your goal is undefined \"I'm going to learn\" that mindset will encourage you to keep going deeper. For example, in my case I spent time working out how to get data into pandas, but I also went down some rabbit-holes of anonymous functions and different file formats which were good to know, but not directly applicable. I didn't get into what's possible to do in numpy because my motivation was to get my project done, not to learn learn learn. \n\n1. Same answer as the other two. \"Do projects.\" 99.9% of programming is going to fall outside of your project's scope, so it naturally limits you to a domain that should be manageable. If it doesn't, then the programming mindset of continually breaking down the problem until you have something you can solve or you can research how to solve it will get you the rest of the way.",

Come up with a similar type of problem, and try to figure that out. If you're not sure where to find coding exercises, ChatGPT is a good source. Don't use it to cheat or \"vibe code\" because you won't learn that way. But you can take a topic, whatever you're learning at the moment(road maps are good for this) and ask it to give you an explanation of how the topic works(like loops as mentioned above, or dictionaries, or whatever) and then ask it to give you some problems to work on. \n\nWhen it comes to coding, doing it really is the key to learning. The more I struggle the more I learn, personally. My first job after graduation for example was as an electrical technician. I learned the very basics of PLC coding in my class but when it came to actually troubleshooting big assembly lines with those programs I really got thrown in the deep end and got exponentially better because of how tough it was at first.",

Perfection is not the aim of the game because you will *never* achieve perfection, because stuff changes all time (including yourself).",

Dad would set the support posts like fence posts aka dig a hole, insert wooden post, pour in a bag of concrete mix, water it with the garden hose, voila!  But no, that wouldn’t last.  So then you learn about the sonotube forms.  Then you learn that concrete touching wooden post isn’t ideal, so you learn about the entire lineup of Simpson Strong-Tie products.  Then you learn about adding an elephant foot base to the bottom of the concrete form.  Then you start learning about different types of forces and loads and how to account for them. And on, and on, and on, and on. \n\nFast forward to my own project.  I swear to god, that thing can hold two semi-trucks parked on top of it.   After the inevitable nuclear war, it will still be here even with the house completely gone.  Ten generations from now, people will think the Romans must have built it as it continues to last through the ages. \n\nAnd thus, the one aspect that never gets discussed in r/Decks.  Over-engineering.  After everything was done, I finally learned that anyone can build a bridge, anyone can build a deck, etc.  It takes an engineer to build one that barely stands (and works).\n\nEdit: as I proofread my post, I vaguely realize I probably should have looked at which sub this was…",

I don't suppose you kept the material from your prior courses? It would help you to review the stuff you should have learned.\n\nOther things to consider is learning a second language for small programs (like Python, which can also be used for bigger programs but is nice when you want to write a 100 line program to do something simple). The other is learning git.\n\nWrite down the things you need to learn. Prioritize the list. Try to focus on just 2-3 things (or less) and try to keep it short term. Once a week, write down how well the past week went. If you achieved the tasks, write that down. If you didn't, write that down.

Most of the top software engineers make a ton of money at work and then spend their free time with their families and friends—they don't hang around on Reddit all day typing comments about OOP. Typically it's the jobless, the students, or the juniors with low responsibility at work who have extra time and motivation to hang around on programming forums all day. Exceptions apply of course, but that's the general gist of it.\n2. Most of the best software out there is written with OOP, Java, C++... Basically with everything that you don't see as being fancy or recommended on Reddit.\n\nCan you find a connection between these two points?\n\nCould it be that the real seniors who are working on real projects and being paid top money are still using OOP, Java, C++, etc.? Or to be more accurate, they use whatever works the best for the task at hand, whether that's OOP or FP or something else entirely?\n\nMeanwhile the \"seniors\" who either 1. haven't quite grasped OOP *yet*, or 2. gave up after they failed once instead of thriving to improve —are the very people who are most active on these forums, trying to justify their opinions to others, religiously hating the most successful and widespread paradigm of all time instead of learning the ups and downs of each approach.\n\nSo why do these people hate OOP in the first place? Because it's easy to get wrong. It's an insanely potent tool when used right, but it takes years of experience, active studying, experimenting, and trial and error to get right. They've seen horrible inheritance trees based on the \"is-a\" vs \"has-a\" rule, which completely fails if you use it with the English language rather than the physical constructs. Some examples of this going with English are:\n\n- Wrong: A football player *is-a* human -> `FootballPlayer extends Human`\n  - Correct: A human *has-a* job or a hobby -> `player.hobby = football`\n- Wrong: An invisible video-game enemy *is-a* video-game enemy -> `InvisEnemy extends Enemy`\n  - Correct: An enemy character *has-a* opacity -> `enemy.opacity = 0.0`\n- Wrong: An android phone *is-a* phone -> `Android extends Phone`\n  - Correct: A phone *has-a* operating system -> `phone.os = android`\n\nThese are just some of the examples where following the English language fails you, and where you should rely on the [Composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) principle instead. Of course people have taken this too far to the other extereme as well, going as far as erasing all of language support for inheritance and forcing inheritance through composition... which sucks as well. Android very much *is-a* operating system, and Firefox very much *is-a* browser.",

If all the web browsers supported LUA or some new language, then maybe JavaScript wouldn't be he language of choice. Additionally you could argue that TypeScript is the web development language, but it's compilation phase turns it into JavaScript...so is it TypeScript or JavaScript?\n\nI suspect Java and Android is because Java existed, was free, and android needed some language for programmers to develop in.  Also JAVA is nice in that it really hides the hardware/OS from the development process.  You can develop a JAVA app on Windows, Linux, MacOS and be reasonable certain it will run in the Android OS.\n\nI would ague against C++ as the king of the OS, C is more the king of the OS development.  Mostly because all the popular OSes were developed when C++ had more overhead and ran slower, so writing the code in C avoided those issues.  You really don't want your OS to be slowing you down.  \n\nThe Linux Kernel for example is all C and now Rust maybe, I'm not sure.  I suspect Windows is all C.  These days C/C++/Rust are good because they compile down to native CPU instructions so your program has the least amount of overhead.  There is a cost however, in that you have to handle idiosyncrasies between hardware and OSes yourself.  This may be as simple as just compiling for that hardware, but can have other issues.\n\nC# and games I have no comments on.  My guess would be time to market, some programming languages let you produce code faster with fewer bugs, the code may not run as fast as code written in another language, but as long as it runs \"fast enough\" then people will buy it, the company will make money, and the developers will get paid, so everyone is happy.",

You have the enshrined problem (this language is used for this field, so all the tools use that language, and at some point its hard to 'break in' with another language to do the same thing, even if it would be great for it).  You have the 'no can do' problems, like java has a ton of things it simply will not do without arm twisting and work arounds, like operator overloading.  Not a big deal you say?  Consider some linear algebra: AX=B.  In C++, that could look like B = A\\*X;  In java that has to look like B.assign(A.multiply(X));  Now imagine an equation with 5 or 6 pieces in it written the java way... it looks nothing like the math and is hard to write, hard to read, and hard to maintain.   There are several other key things java does not directly support that make it frustrating to use for some tasks, including a bizarre workaround just to have an unsigned int.   Java has nice stuff too, though: it works pretty cleanly on various OS without the frustration that some C++ projects can present when porting.   \n\nC# is tied heavily to windows, and windows has 'won' the gaming audience by and large.  Less so today, but like the enshrined problem with languages, gaming is enshrined in windows very heavily (compared to other desktop OS).  Between that and game engine support and native OS tie in, it has a leg up right away.  Then you add in the pointers and other support that push it towards C++ and away from java's rigid approach, and its performance, you start to see why it pulled into the gaming industry.  Java got (and deserved) a bad rep early on for being slow, and while that has been fixed in a broad sense, it still suffers from the rep and the reality (it still isn't as fast as c++ when push comes to shove). \n\nSo to sort of try to answer.. its a mix of the language's performance, tools, design, and so on alongside an almost 'social' problem of getting a foothold in an area that is already dominated by something else.  New languages come and go, but the ones that stick and are used heavily in any field get there by being better than what was used before.  Python is kind of an oddball there, as its niche is being easy to use for hobby programmers, which is an area that has grown huge (everyone wants a little knowledge now) in the last 20 years or so.  In the 80s and 90s, most people were happy if they could use a word processor without too much work.",

If you're studying something that gives you energy, that you actually enjoy, then you're going to succeed.\n\nGoing to school really worked for me. Progressing through a well structured course and having teachers/classmates I could talk to, ask questions of and practise with was invaluable. Plus, having a recognised qualification at the end of it makes you a credible candidate.\n\nI don't have advice beyond be humble, learn to love the pain of ignorance and be consistent. If you genuinely enjoy coding this will all come easily to you. Good luck and have fun!\n\nEdit: typos",

It's easier to show the technical managers what you have built than just yapping about it. In my experience, everyone in the webdev bootcamp I have attended, knows that personal projects are crucial to land a job, but most end up not building anything either way.\n\nAlso, I think Python is agood starting point, but if I were you, I'd pick a niche on top of python. For example build an API server using python, or build an automation script using python. \n\nThat way, if you got offer for role that's not related to python, you can still explain the technology and mechanisms, even though they are using different programming language. \n\n\nI know I'm still very junior, but I'm sharing this to paint the picture of the path you may experience as a career shifter.

Each language is designed with different tradeoffs for a different use case/purpose. C is an old language that's supposed to work close to the hardware. You have direct control of all the memory, and you don't pay for abstractions that you don't use. As a beginner programmer, you probably don't care about any of that unless your explicit goal is to use the language as a means to learn about what's going on at the hardware level. It sounds like you just want to build something cool. Languages like C# or python or javascript are much better suited to that purpose. Moreover, there is really no rule that you need to \"stick to a language\". Sure, if you're a professional with 10 YoE it makes sense to stick to your area of expertise, but besides that, you should feel free to oscillate between lots of languages whenever you want. Even single projects can combine multiple languages. You should think first about what you want to learn or build, and then work from there to what's a good language for that. You can learn the basics of a new language in like an hour, and you'll never truly master any language so don't even worry about that.",

At university you got probably got two different subjects like analysis and design just to understand this all.\n\nSo, you want to create a blackjack game? Then imagine how it is played in real life, you have a deck made of cards, you have a dealer, you have one or more players, players ask for cards (or the dealer draws cards), they bet, and the one closer to 21 points wins. Write down in text the interactions, like \"the dealer shuffles two, three, four decks of cards\", \"the dealer deals one card to every player\", \"the players bet\", etc, etc, and then find the nouns and the verbs. Nouns are potential classes (player, dealer, card, deck, bet, etc) whereas verbs are potential methods (deal, bet, withdraw, etc). Then build the relations between the different nouns, in terms of pure OOP how the player interacts with the dealers, what is the \"protocol\" between them, which \"messages\" does the player expect the dealer to handle, which \"messages\" the dealer expects the player to handle, etc.\n\nMaybe you should begin with simpler designs? Like create a File class that lets you work with files? Create a Calculator class that lets you execute math operations? That might help.",

Be dumb.\n\n\nIf that means rarely or never using 95% of what OOP has offer, then **that's the right way to do it**!\n\n\nDon't use inheritance at all, unless you know it's going to save you a LOT of typing. And even then, be very careful with it, keep it absolutely minimal, and don't layer it. Especially multiple inheritance.\n\n\nDon't use static props and methods in your design. They are typically just a bandaid on what could otherwise be done by regular props and methods. They're mainly helpful when you code yourself into a corner and don't want to redo large bits, so don't use them in the beginning.\n\n\nDon't try to organize your code according to the typical OOP tutorials. It never works. Real world code is not made out of Dogs and Rectangles.\n\n\nIf you're fighting the multimethod problem, aka if you cannot decide between doing `dog.eat(food)` or `food.eatenBy(dog)`, consider making an `Eating` class, and then call `eating.eat(dog, food)`.\n\n\nUse OOP mainly to encapsulate state, as in, have each object only directly talk to its own data. Don't modify values inside objects other than self. Use getters/setters. That way you can intercept the modifications and ensure that the data within the object is always consistent.\n\n\nTry to have classes that are either mostly/fully just data, or mostly/fully just functions. Those are your \"nouns\" and \"verbs\", analogical to the structs and functions in non-OOP languages.\n\n\nBe perfectly happy with making a class which is only instantiated once. In fact, most of your classes should probably be instantiated only once.\n\n\n\"The problem with OOP is that you want a banana, but you get a monkey holding a banana, inside the rest of the jungle\" - someone else's quote.\n\n\nOOP is too much. It's a huge pile of features. The worst thing you can do is trying to use them all just because they exist.\n\n\nConsider this: goto and global variables exist too.\n\n\nWrite a basic class that doesn't inherit anything, add regular methods, regular properties, one constructor if needed to pre-fill the properties, and then instantiate it and use it.

Then identify the relationships between those objects (i.e. Deck has 52 cards, Player/Delear has a Hand, Hand is a collection of Cards etc). The identify some of the action that can be done against those objects (i.e. Deck shuffles, Deck deals a Card, Player/Dealer Stands or Plays, the Hand requests a Card, Hand goes bust, Hand has a Total).\n\nOnce you have the OOD uses that design to play out imaginary games on paper and refine the design until it works as expected.

They used this crazy nested loops and nested if else constructs and an array. It did not implement the desired logic precisely so it kept running into cases it didn't acct for. Anyway i rewrote that whole thing and used a map map set. Now for a tiny bit of extra memory we don't have to worry about missing cases cause the desired logic is exact for each scenario without having to handle individual scenarios.  It also runs twice as fast but this was not really a concern. The logic being proper according to specs is the real change. I should never see this issue again. New cases should have no impact now and be processed precisely.   \n   \nAnother item was a batch job that have 15 if else blocks to run the same logic on 15 different string builders. Rewrote that to reuse 1 string builder and remove all the  if else blocks using a bucketing approach and while loop. Now the records can expand as much as needed without issue. Used to be every time data grew someone would add another if else.",

There are several alleys towards unblocking and you must timebox your attempts, not fall for sunk cost fallacy, reassess the problem, rubber duck yours, others and even 3rd party code, ask for help, ask for clarifications, break down the problem into known facts, stash/shelve your changes and start over, or my favorite: do something else and come back to the problem later.\n\nRemember: the only thing that can solve a problem is a solution to it, and debugging for months isn't a solution, it may help identify the problem but that depends how you go about it. You are also not responsible for all the overlying causes to blockers, so if it tends to happen over and over in the same code base maybe it's the code base and not you (as a senior dev I've found that the faster I assess that the code base stinks, the faster I deal with blockers).\n\nThere are resources online that tackle this very part of software development and with science and practice you'll unblock yourself much faster and you won't feel blocked that many times.",

(But you can get far with other, less conventional techniques too: flashcards work for some people, a Zettelkasten for others, or try building a memory palace or using mnemonics or singing a song about Python or whatever. Do what works best for you, and feel free to use multiple methods.)\n\n>I kinda draw a blank on what to write when watching videos or reading code, because everything seems important\n\nIt sounds like you're early on in your learning journey right now, so it's no wonder that there's a lot to learn. You can't whittle it down yet; it will whittle itself down as you get more experienced. Start anyway. Be prepared to forget a lot the first few times you do it: memory builds up gradually and incrementally, not all at once.\n\nSooner or later, you'll have used for loops (or whatever) so much that you can throw away your old notes on them entirely, or refine those notes into just the tricky little corners you keep getting stuck on or some cool new feature you heard about recently. That's okay. Your notes can evolve with you.\n\nTry working through a tutorial on whatever language you're learning, and every week or three, pause to design yourself a \"cheat sheet\" of what you've learnt so far. (Look up other cheat sheets on Google Images for inspiration of how to lay them out. Try to make it maximally useful for **you**, not just to cram it full of as much information as you can get on the page. Don't be afraid to go through lots of rough drafts and lots of scrap paper. This step **is** the learning process.)",

So I do recommend trying to dedicate time to that. You can go through a basic tutorial and write and execute the code, and keep doing this with increasingly advanced concepts in the programming language you're interested in.\n\nBest of luck!!",

I had issues with fine motor control, basically it hurts to write.  The biggest issues with this is that my penmanship sucks, and I trained myself to get to the point quickly.  I would write just enough to get the point across.  This didn't help my English grade when I need to write a three page paper.  So I had to constantly go back and be more descriptive.  My family got a home PC and this helped, but I still needed to write out all my answers for tests.\n\n2. My short term memory was found to be lacking.  This frustrated my parents because if I wasn't actively listening to them when they told me to do something I would literally not remember what they said, or often not even remember we had a conversation.  Of course the way around this was they had to make sure they had my full attention before telling me to do something.\n\n3. There might have been other stuff, but I don't remember. \n\nLooking back on school, I did well in Math and Science where I would understand the concepts and apply them.  I did poorly in History and English where there is a lot of memorization.\n\nI am now the lead programming architect at my company.  If people have bugs they can't solve, they come to me.  If people don't know how to write something, they come to me.  If there is a bug anywhere in our code base, I can fix it, not because I remember exactly what that code does, but I understand how that code should work.\n\nWhen programming people start off learning the language, which is needed.  The only way you are going to remember the language is by using it, by writing programs. I \"know\" many many languages, I will learn a new one for fun to see if I like it better than whatever is currently my favorite, but if I don't program in a language for a month, I have to use google to refresh my memory.\n\nTruthfully, anyone can learn a programming language, but to really program you need to be able to think logically, you need to be able to break big problems down into smaller tasks, then break those smaller tasks into even smaller tasks.  You keep doing that until those tasks are small enough that you can logically perform them in a programming language....any programming language.  The language is just a way to tell the computer what it needs to do and there are many ways to do that.  Again the only way to get good at that, is to program.",

Programming is the one discipline where it’s actually encouraged to rely on the internet as much as you want since it would be impractical for us to remember every little detail about every language and library we use, and most programming languages and libraries have extensive documentation online.\n\nOnce you are past learning the fundamental structures of code (data types, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.) everything you want to do with code is just a few well-constructed google searches away. Learning to code is as much about learning how to do efficient research as it is about learning actual coding.\n\nI will say, having short term memory just emphasizes the need for good coding practices even more, which many beginners tend to neglect. Good coding is all about foresight, and sacrificing time in the present to save you work in the future. Make sure you take the time to write yourself clear and helpful comments at every step of the way while coding and whenever you see multiple ways of writing some code, choose the way that is easiest to read; this will save you so much mental strain down the road. You should be able to tell generally what a piece of code does just by looking at it for a few seconds, even if it’s like you’ve never seen it before.\n\nYou’ll also learn there are ways of structuring your code such that you don’t have to remember how the whole system works all at once in order to understand one piece of it. This is actually one of the key tenets of object oriented design, often called “abstraction”. The better you learn to follow these design principles the easier of a time you will have coding bigger and bigger projects.",

How much experience do/did you actually get?

It is essential that you talk through your problem-solving steps, be very verbal, and don't stop talking while you are working.

For example, 'talk about a time when you found yourself running out of time to complete a project'. Each behavior question should be treated as an opportunity to send a signal about yourself - You are smart, work well with others, take ownership, think deeply when solving problems, etc. Review the Amazon Leadership principles (there are 14 of them), and try to include at least one in every single behavior answer. \n* Technical interviews are a learned skill.

I am unfamiliar with the word \"placement\", but it would probably help others if you mentioned you're from India so you get replies from those in India, otherwise, you tend to get an American or European perspective.\n\nI think it all depends on how well you know a programming language and DSA. There are two kinds of people (more than that, of course). There are those who want to learn a few key skills and be done with it, with a guarantee they won't have to learn anything more. I call this the \"barista\" type. You can't learn to make lattes and cappuccinos right away, but once you do, you're set. There's not a whole lot more to learn.\n\nThen, there are those that like to learn new things. It's this type that tends to do better as a programmer. \n\nI'm sure there are some jobs that don't require you to get past a certain point, e.g., there are still Cobol jobs and Cobol programmers, and that isn't changing so rapidly.  But for the most part, you'll likely have to learn something new. For example, I was programming in Java a lot, but if I were to do AI programming, I'd likely have to switch to Python.\n\nSorry there aren't any clear cut answers. If you ask \"If I do X, will Y happen\", the answer is, it depends on how you do X. That is, it depends on how much you master a programming language.\n\nTo delve into this just a bit deeper, there are two aspects to mastering a programming language.\n\nThe first has to do with learning the language, which means syntax/semantics of stuff like assignment statements, arrays, functions, classes, etc. It also means getting familiar with popular libraries. You may also have to learn a build tool. More recent languages tend to assume you're building a bigger program with multiple files.\n\nThe other part--and some would argue the more important part is to learn to think algorithmically. That is, how do you solve a problem. That part can depend on skills outside of programming. For example, if you are trying to trying to simulate gravity for a physics engine to be used in a video game, then you need to know some physics. You have to express the physics as code.\n\nJust because you program, you may lack the expertise in what the program is about. \n\nThen, there is a kind of vague goal of trying to organize your code well. I've been using Claude to help organize some of my personal projects and it does a pretty good job.",

So for your case, C++ and Python will do.\n\nFor DSAs, my advice is to pick Python because it's the easiest way to learn DSAs without worrying about the complexity of the language. When it comes to interviews, they will allow you to pick the language you are comfortable with. And Python will always be there as an option.\n\nIt's possible you just didn't like the web dev course by Harry. So try out another learning material. Or if nothing works, then it just means you don't like web dev.\n\nIn regards to the question in the post, if you can solve DSA questions, then you are halfway there. So many ask DSA questions in the interviews. So def get good at that. You should also get comfortable with OOP/OOD/design principles/SOLID patterns and other basic patterns. And work on some project that you are interested in. Use Git/GitHub to manage your project. Also, work on your behavioural interviews, use the STAR method: [https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR\\_Method\\_Interviews.pdf](https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf)",

Yes, they can't handle load, but you'll only have one client.) You'd use the localhost loopback to put the client and server on the same device. If it's OK to do everything in-browser, you could write everything in Brython and use standard HTML forms and JavaScript APIs. Making the client and server communicate is not that much harder. You'd do custom handlers. GUIs usually have at least two threads anyway, so you'll have to do something like this regardless. It might be slightly easier to install Bottle at that point, but the standard library can do it.\n\nThere's Gooey which automatically converts command-line applications into GUIs.

It also opened up embedded systems more which goes along with the robotics, which now in my final year of college ive been making an autonomous drone for detecting and spraying pesticides on different types of plants.\n\nOf course you can do this in python as well, but C and C++ add some layers of challenge and fun because you can actually do everything by register level programming which gets fun and writing drivers.\n\nAnyways, not to say my path is the one you should follow but I think really sinking your teeth into one or two fields will give you a different perspective and don’t hold back, go full throttle into it.

A full-stack developer is expected to be able to build an entire modern application from the ground up on their own, more or less. \n\nI'm not sure if it's really a choice you should be making as a freshman? Like, as a student you should be learning a little bit about all of these things ANYWAYS and you should be constructing small projects from the ground up to get your feet under you, but I think that level of specialization (or, in the case of a full-stack developer, that profound committment to not specializing) is something you don't really settle in to until you're a bit more experienced?",

I've heard that Indian universities (at least some of them) have a more practical curriculum than those in, say, the US. They are more likely to cover specific technologies (say, Spring, or some web framework).\n\nIn any case, \"good choice\" is subjective. It's certainly popular. You're not going to get one answer, so you'll have to decide among many answers. For example, someone could say there's a lack of young Cobol programmers and despite fewer jobs being in Cobol, they exist, and are mostly by older programmers that may retire soon.\n\nIs that a good choice? Most would say no, but maybe? There's less competition, but that could mean fewer opportunities as well.\n\nGiven its popularity, it's probably not a bad choice, provided you're willing to do other things.\n\nOther choices, which may or may not be available to you are data science, machine learning, but they do require more math (e.g., statistics).",

What is the benefit of doing projects that you’re not even interested in doing, that you let AI do for you?\n\nMy programming is my job. I show up at my job, I do my work, I log off.

Programming jobs would only be for the handful of people making these CASE-tools.\n\nSo I went into hardware instead. And then the web happened, and all the CASE-tools for making mainframe business-programs were shoved to one side, because now everyone had to build something new. \n\nIn the late 90s everyone talked about programming being replaced by drawing UML-diagrams and then emailing them to India or other countries with cheaper labour, and they would then do the actual programming.\n\nThen languages like Python began to become popular, and everyone talked about programming not being just for programmers anymore, because now everyone could learn to program, and there would be no more need for dedicated programmers.\n\nThen a lot of low-code and no-code tools became popular, and everyone talked about that soon there wouldn't be more need for programmers.\n\nIn the late 2010s everyone began talking about how everything was already built, and in the future there wouldn't be more need for programmers, since most of the jobs would be simple adjustments to existing frameworks.\n\nAnd now, in the mid 2020s, everyone is talking about how in the future there won't be need for programmers, because some tool will handle everything for us.\n\n  \nThe problem with those tools, as amazing as they all are, is that they can only solve \"yesterdays problems\". As soon as some new technology, or a new business-problem, or a new oppertunity comes along, they aren't up to the job, and programmers have to step in.\n\nSo go ahead and focus on your interests - if you enjoy learning, programming, robotics, AI or whatever, you'll become good at it, and it will help you learn more stuff! Programming is always a good thing to learn - most of us won't work with the technologies we began learning on, but getting into the mindset of solving problems and building software, will always be a good thing! Even when the tech changes - only specific tech-knowledge becomes obsolete, but usually you use it to make learning the next thing easier!",

AI is also prone to hallucinations and many major companies, such as my current employer,  will not use it and are NOT sharing their code into AI as they want to protect their intellectual property. \n\n If your high school has a vocational program that includes computer programming, consider enrolling.

Perfect! You're close to understanding reduce because all 3 share one foundational behavior: Run a function on each item of the array.\n\nNow, here's how they differ:\n\nforEach: You want to just call the function for each item in the array. You don't necessarily want to do anything to the items or the array itself and you don't want to return anything.\n\nmap: You want to transform each item in the array into a new value. Example: You have an array with the values 1,2,3? Use map to transform the array into a new array with the values 2,4,6. The key here is your goal is to transform the original array into a new array with new items. The new array is an array of the same length as the original. Start with 3 items in your array? You'll end with 3 items in your new array.\n\nreduce: Similarly to map, your goal is to transform the array into something else. However, that something else can be anything! With map, you return a new array. With reduce, you return a new ANYTHING. You can turn the original array into an object (most common use case) or you can return a number, string, boolean, literally whatever you want. Example: Have an array of 1,2,3? Use reduce to return the sum of all numbers.",

Write a function to, I don't know, calculate the totalPrice of a list of Product objects, each with its own price ... Here's the solution, just so you know what I mean:\n\n    function calculateTotalPrice(products) {\n      let totalPrice = 0;\n      for(const product of products) {\n        totalPrice += product.price;\n      }\n      return totalPrice;\n    }\n\n  \nThen, when that works, write a more generic function, that doesn't know about product.price, but takes another function as a parameter, one that returns the value to add to the totalPrice. Meaning that this function should be able to calculate any total.\n\nAnd continue on to you have basically re-implemented .reduce with your own code.\n\nIt is important that you write it yourself, using your own thinking, and not get the solution from somewhere else, because it isn't about the solution, it is about the thinking that goes into it.\n\nThat is how I learned most of the array-functions (filter, map, etc.), coming from the old procedural way of thinking, I wrote my own implementation (with loads of bugs and imperfections) to understand what was going on.\n\n  \nAnd the benefit of using the builtin functions, is that other people know what they mean and can read it quickly, but having to understand someone elses implementation always requires having to read a lot of code, until you realize: ah, he's just reducing!",

Perhaps there is a better way. \n\nSometimes, there are few examples because  the use case is very old, and the greybeards who solved these problems though the solutions were intuitive enough that they did not put them on the internet, or they predate that custom. \n\nSometimes, there are few examples because your use case is actually esoteric, and you must figure it out. \n\nMost of the time, you can work through not understanding how some code works or how to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller steps that you do understand. The ability to do this is a fundamental engineering skill. ",

Classes, modules, folders, packages, microservices, clusters are just different ways of organizing functions. The bad architect (let's call them John) looks towards options higher up in that list, when putting a bunch of files into a well-named folder would be just as clean.\n2. Functions with side-effects need special attention: A pure function will rarely cause scalability issues, a function that upserts into a database will. Learning to segregate side effects is a skill that takes a lifetime to learn, but it really helps if you don't have to use @Transcational 8 times during a HTTP request's execution. The other day I sped up a messy procedure by 500% just by moving all db lookups to one place and parallelizing them, John would have held architecture meetings for the next half year to make the service with 20 monthly users \"multi-instance ready\" instead of identifying the bottleneck.\n3. Bounded-everything. To know how much scale you need, know how many resources you need. That's easy when you write code that needs a fixed amount of RAM, or that runs in a fixed amount of time. John does `database.readAll()` until one day the server crashes, and he gets pat on the back when he fixes the issue after a two-day outage. (Turns out the service was not multi-instance ready and they all crashed)\n4. Distributed systems are HARD. People love to add microservices willy nilly because it looks cool in the diagrams, but just really try to avoid it. I usually play devils advocate for just making a big monolith. Stick to conway's law, that's fine, but NO JOHN WE DO NOT NEED 11 FUNCTION APPS WITH 300LOC EACH JUST BECAUSE YOU READ ABOUT THE ADAPTER PATTERN AND KAFKA IN SOME BOOK.

So as much as like the command-line and keybinds, I prefer the more visual approach, where I can swap over to the mouse at certain times (for for certain workflows). I prefer VSCode (even though I program on Linux).\n\nThat said, you can use Vim keybinds (and custom keybinds) in VSCode, and you can use VSCode keybinds in Vim.\n\nOverall, I'd argue that Vim will slow you down (at least at first), and you're better off trying it out later when you have some more experience under your belt. With Vim, once you get a grasp on everything you're doing, all of your macros, and map all of your keybinds perfectly... you'll be blazing fast. Editing code, refactoring code, and navigating between functions, files, and folders will be instant. But getting there is HARD and, debatably, acute speed isn't a huge priority when it comes to writing code, or writing quality code.\n\nI'd say, in regards to people I've worked with who use Vim, they're typically \"not faster than me at all\" or they're something like \"10% faster than me at best\". There's always the rare exception, the sweaty nerd who's so good at Vim that they're flying through code and edits at light speed, but they're rare, and I'd suggest that \"it has more to do with them\" than it does \"Vim\".

Also LeetCode and that type of programming doesn't really translate to real world projects. The best way to get better is by doing simple projects at first, and add complexity over time. For instance, I used to be a trainer for cyber developers in the C programming language. We used to start them off by having them build a simple calculator. What they didn't know is that we weren't really grading how well they could add and subtract numbers, but rather how secure their code was. Can I break it, or exploit it in some way? Are they checking for underflow and overflow? After a couple failed submissions they would finally catch on and understand what they needed to do to pass the tests. Next would be FileCalc, which is okay do the same thing, but all the equations are stored in files, and I want you to give me a file of all the solutions. Again we'd test them by giving them bad files to see if they were doing proper error handling and such. Then there was ThreadCalc, which was okay now do everything using a thread pool. And NetCalc, okay now do ThreadCalc but over a network.\n\nIf they could do all of that we figured they had learned enough to be on the team and contribute. But it takes time. You do most of your learning through failing, not succeeding. So take everything you're doing right now and understand that it's hard and that's okay. Nobody should expect you to be able to contribute immediately unless you're experienced.\n\nAlso, we have quite a few west point grads, and they struggle as much as anyone would. So don't feel like you're going through it alone. It takes time to get good. A lot of it is about pattern recognition. Over time you'll start to see what are called \"code smells\" and you'll immediately see things that look weird and out of place, which means you're improving. If you can look at code you did 6 months ago and your immediate reaction is: \"this is garbage\", then that's a tell-tale sign you're improving. Good luck and don't sweat the small stuff.",

When you establish an initial contact, go over the following\n\n* Ask what they hope to get out of the tutoring? Are they primarily interested in learning concepts?\n* Inform them what you're willing to do for them\n* Inform them what you're not willing to do for them\n\nI can imagine two kinds of students that would want tutoring. First, there's those that are being forced to get a tutor because they are struggling. Maybe parents are pushing them. This can also work the other way where parents are trying to get their kids ahead. Second would be an older learner who just wants to get started. They are likely more motivated.\n\nThe difficulty in tutoring is whether students want you to do their homework for them, or do their projects for them. This is cheating. If you don't want to facilitate that, you should indicate that ahead of time.\n\nFor example, you can explain a scenario to the student where you say \"If you say to me 'I have to turn in this programming assignment by tomorrow, or I'll get a zero, and I've barely started!', I'm going to tell you, no, I don't do that. You should plan ahead on your assignments and not rely on me to do them for you.\"\n\nSetting expectations is something you should do.\n\nYou learn to teach as you go along, so what works for one student might not work for another.",

Now this is a broad model of how a ui program works, there are many other paradigms used, however in event driven architectures it can mostly be boiled down to mvc or model view control.  \n\nWith games or any ui program with a simulation info does kind of loop in the simulation/model. But this still doesn't really break the previous statement, how paradox games work is in the event handling side of things it is basically 2 steps repeated over and over: get players input then compute new state, when one of the players is lagging what happens is its basically blocking on the get players input stage, the simulation doesn't look at real time it looks at simulations slices (ticks), and so to the simulation everything comes in at the same time, but at the get players input we know that isn't true. Typically the lag will come from one player not verifying the previous simulation slice fast enough.",

Instead the game just runs slower and it takes longer to pass time in the game. Rimworld has a similar system where it aims for a set tick amount per second and throttles to a slower tick speed to try and prevent lag by slowing the game down.\n\nLets say your cpu can handle 100 calculations per tick. In essence what happens is if over the course of the game you go from 100 calculations per tick up to 1000 calculations per tick over the course of a game, then the tick speed will get 10x slower by the end and you shouldn't in theory see your computer drop below 60 fps",

I'm pretty sure there's some bottom floor to the rock speed so instead of lowering the speed any more, the game lags\n\n2.) there's some fundamental problem in the Clausewitz engine paradox games made that causes the game to lag when hitting that lower bound where it processes stack up causing lag. I assume this is bc the CPU usage is wildly inconsistent second to second due to a possible lack of  multi threading engine architecture, so the games frequently max out cpu usage at 100%. This is why the lag can sometimes disappear when lowering game speed by one level even though tick speed didn't change.\n\nRimWorld does not have this problem in my experience and only really experiences lag from running out of memory (or poorly optimized mods).",

With Qt and Slint you actually write the layout of your UI using a custom language and then you can connect to the markup via Rust, C++, Python, JavaScript. In a sense it can feel like web programming: you have a separate markup file and event listeners.\n\nYou can also target OS-native APIs from C++, C#, or Swift if you want to build apps for specific platforms only.\n\nAnd there are many other widget libraries, either language-specific (like Glimmer for Ruby) or cross-language, like wxWidgets or GTK. There are many-many choices and also many libraries that wrap other libraries. Like, with wxWidgets in order to target Linux you can use wxGTK or wxQt, and similar things exist for other platforms.\n\nI would first decide whether cross-platform support is a must, and then pick a language and look for options for that specific language.",

I did get pretty good with scripting languages though.\n\nFor the last few months I’ve been doing Boot.dev and it’s been a game changer.

A cert, bootcamp, or experience can be just as good.\n\nThe big issue for me, like you, will be taking a pay cut. As an IT Manager I make good money, so I’ll have to find the right thing. I don’t want to live in a major city, so that will hold me back as well. My plan is to create some side hustle things, easy things like a Secret Santa app to gain experience.

Intermediate concepts have a tendency to come organically. For instance, memory management, vectors and pointers are not really worth looking into if you're a complete beginner, however whilst working with fundamental concepts, you will eventually have a need for a dynamic array, or will want to edit variables inside of a function - it is at this point you'll learn these more advanced concepts.\n\nIn terms of \"real world projects\", just automate one aspect of your life, then move onto another, as you get better at coding you'll discover things you can automate you previously didn't realise.",

As others have mentioned too, the SLT executives also don't pay for quality execution and productization either (UI/UX, actual internal tooling, Quality assurance testing, organizational software to actually help PMs and engineers, etc.).\n\n\nIt's not just being cheap on Total Compensation.  Internally there's very little travel and expenses budgets, morale events are gone and often paid by managers, no free food or snacks, the equipment is cheap, internal IT is garbage tier, we had to fight to get replacement computers. Also, those bonuses were structured in a way to be weaponized. You NEVER hit max bonus and more often hit midpoint or less if the manager just disliked you.\n\n\nPeople like to joke about Amazon's \"frugality\" leadership principle. But there's a difference between the definition of frugal (pay for just enough) and Microsoft's cheapness.\n\nEdit: Let me add one more cheap thing. Microsoft just had their 50th Anniversary. I would say that's quite a milestone for a big company, right? Let's just say when Windows 11 came out, we all got to pick out pretty fantastic goodies (sweaters, premium jackets, memorabilia's, etc.). For the 50th...I got to pick out a Teams background. And watch 3 CEOs pat each other on the back. Oh, and more copilot features (internal copilot is garbage tier and extremely watered down).",

        "body": "Investors want profit, which is revenue minus costs. Software needs developers, which are expensive. The big promise of AI is to drastically slash software development costs. There are a couple of ways for doing that:\n\n* By allowing less skilled folks to create good-enough software without having to pay experienced developers. Here, AI tools compete with the low-code/no-code industry. Nothing new.\n* By making good developers more productive. This is where AI-based code completion comes in.\n* By having the AI system independently solve high-level tasks. This is the dream of “agentic AI”.\n\nIt doesn't matter for AI companies if there will be fewer mid-skilled developers buying their subscriptions. A client company wants to get some amount of software development done. In theory, it can achieve this by some mix of humans and AI tools. Choosing some amount of AI is an economic win-win situation if AI-productivity is more cost-effective than human-productivity. But this means the price cap of an AI tool subscription isn't hundreds of dollars per month, but whatever it would cost to hire another human developer. And good developers are quite expensive.\n\nNow the neat thing for AI companies is that they don't have to realize these productivity gains themselves. They just have to convince other businesses that there *could* be productivity gains using these tools, that everyone else is doing it, and that your investors will start asking questions if you don't also jump on the hype train.\n\nIn a gold rush, sell shovels.\n\nThe problem here is that AI tools aren't cost-effective (yet). They are generally not cost-effective for users due to quite uneven quality, and they're not sold at-cost by the tool providers, because GPUs are so dang expensive. Currently, the field is propelled by the belief that the economics will work out soon™.\n\nPersonally, I'm fairly relaxed about this. AI-written code is generally well below my skill-level (especially when taking architecture and design concerns into account), and I don't see a plausible path for AI to catch up. Ever-bigger models with ever-larger context windows cost exponentially more, which could mean that the productivity:cost break-even point for high-skill activities like software development is never reached before the tool providers go bankrupt. There are also systematic problems, like software projects having a lot of implicit and oral context that is not available to an LLM.\n\nAI is probably here to stay, but software developers are some of the last folks who have to worry about this.",

Not the case. I'm given a puzzle that I've never done before, given a deadline to finish it, and asked every single day (multiple times) how close I am to finishing it.\n\nThis is not true. You're talking about book-keeping. Accounting - which is much broader - can be an extremely complex job depending on what you're working on. It is rarely deterministic.\n\nAgain, you're confusing modern accounting with old school accounting.\n\n>The fact that once they do their time at the Big 4 + get their CPA, they are basically set for life. The grind ACTUALLY seems to pay off in their career. \n\nThe issue with this logic is that the equivalent of getting your CPA and doing your time at a Big 4 is not \"average SWE job\". You need a 5 years BS+MS degree, pass the CPA certification, and then be a really, really good candidate. \n\nLike, if you were a CS MS grad from a top 50 school and got accepted to a FAANG you would also be set for life. And you wouldn't have to live through those 60-80 hour weeks working at a big 4. \n\n>In tech? You have to study LeetCode, OOP, System Design over and over and over every time you want to job hop\n\nThis is also not true. I have worked at a bunch of companies that never did \"grind to prepare for this\" interviews. And the more experience you get, the less likely this is to happen.\n\n>The fact that it's a stable job and literally everyone needs them.\n\nI think this is valid, but the trade-off is money. And again - Big 4 money is great, but Big 4 money is not what the average accountant is making, and if you're an average developer, you're not going to be an elite accountant.\n\n>The fact that their interviews consist of 1-2 behavioural rounds and that's literally it\n\n1. This isn't accurate as most of them are going to be asked to work through a business case or something along those lines, but also 2. Part of it is that it's a regulated industry so not only do you have to get and maintain a CPA, but your work is also much more likely to hard to f\\*\\*\\* up without someone noticing. Like, accounting is not a field where you \"fail fast\", where \"don't let good enough get in the way of perfect\" flies. \n\nWhich mind you - is the thing that can make it extremely taxing.\n\n>Immune to AI and offshoring due to legal reasons\n\nImmune to offshoring, sure.\n\nImmune to AI - way less immune than developers. Because you don't even need AI - decent ML could take a huge axe to accounting jobs. That just hasn't happened yet, but the risk is there, and much higher than the odds that you will automate developers.",

And despite your belief that accountants don’t have to deal with debugging, a lot of the work is checking for mistakes in tax documents/filings and referencing various tax laws to try to figure out why numbers don’t line up.\n\nYou also imply accountants have better WLB. Just like with software engineering, this really depends on your company, team, and role. Furthermore, work hours are consistently brutal across the entire industry during tax season; expect 80-100 hours a week in the first quarter and 60+ during the extension period. My WLB as a SWE is significantly better than all the accountants I know.\n\nLastly, accounting is just as vulnerable to being replaced by AI as our own, which you probably don’t realize because you don’t spend time in those circles and/or they don’t complain about it as much as we do. Just do a quick Google search for AI accounting tools and look at how many results pop up.\n\nThe only thing accounting has on software engineering right now is stability, but if you want more stability for generally shittier pay there’s way better jobs for that.",

Even today with 5 YoE, recruiters get shook at that one contribution I did in 2023 to the most popular logging solution for Salesforce. The other thing you can do is build your own projects to demonstrate you can build new things from scratch. Start simple, build a blog, add comments, add the ability to subscribe via email, tie it in to a content-management system - Lotta places need blogs. Once that's done, chronical your open source contributions & post tech-related content on there. There's a certain \"man's is published, he knows what he's doing\" energy from having a nice blog.\n\nEssentially the goal is to build a sufficiently impressive portfolio that you have *something* to put on a resume & something to talk about in an interview. A nice plus is if your projects make money - could be a small amount, even just $1-5 / month is noteworthy. \n\nA lot of people are giving you shit - but we all started from nothing at some point, it might take 6-12 months for you to build a sufficiently impressive portfolio that it lands you a job - but a year from now is a year from now regardless of what you do now. It may as well be the case that a year from now you work in tech as opposed to not.",

One thing he continuously emphasized is that it's a *copilot*. We are still the pilots. He himself said that the most dangerous thing about Copilot, and the biggest disasters he's seen, are people that trust it. Copilot is a tool that can help us quickly get through mundane tasks. It is not a resource that can be used to blindly generate code we ship to production. *The creators* are telling us that it should not be used for blind code generation. That's telling.\n\nA funny thing about those trainings that I noticed is that the instructor himself struggled a lot during all his demos because the AI wouldn't co-operate, and he had to live debug why things weren't working the way he wanted. It's very telling when a *live demo to a major customer* goes haywire.\n\nI use AI the exact same way I use StackOverflow. It's a tool to get me information, or get quick answers to mundane tasks. It's *not* something I just copy/paste. It *augments* my abilities, it doesn't generate my code.

I have good success when I ask AI to make small code changes, not full on large features for half the the ticket I'm working on.\n\nI used AI heavily when I first started my job that used a framework I didn't have much experience with and over time I new what I was doing and avoid AI unless I need it to debug my code or can't find what I'm looking for on stack overflow or code docs. Sometimes I use AI to automate simple and but long tasks that would otherwise be easy but monotonous to do. \n\n\nOverall I would say not to become dependent on AI. If you know how to code what you want to code, it will be faster if you code it yourself and not ask the robo intern to do it for you.",

        "body": "I had a fun observation recently.\nWorking with Claude Code, I started out slow getting it to review and understand that structure of the codebase I'm working on, it run and analysis and report back things like \"The project is well, structured and cleanly coded adheres to best principles,\" kind of comments.\n\n\nThen I'd coach it through, tell to analyze a specific pattern being used in the project (for example the exception handling pattern in use) and point it a feature that had the pattern fully and correctly implemented and tell it \"Feature A shows the exemplar for this pattern, analyze the implementation carefully. Now apply the exemplar pattern to feature B,\"\n\n\nAnd it would do a good job of correctly implementing the pattern and saved a substantial amount of time. It'd get things wrong here and there and always needed a clean up, but overall it did about as well as a decent intern.\n\n\nAnd then I started giving a little more latitude. I wrote out a requirements document for a new feature, got it to analyze the code base again, feed it the requirements document and worked through it with it.\n\n\nIt did a reasonable job of putting together code that met the requirements. I did catch it trying to cheat on the unit tests, very badly. Something it definitely learnt from the unit tests in its training data. It did hallucinate a few things and left some half implemented code it had started and then deserted lying around. The worst thing I caught it doing was going of and off and making changes to completely unrelated code that would've broken things.\nBut overall, it's output was mediocre AF. It was messy, convoluted, had nonsensical functions it had added and forgotten about, barely conformed to the patterns required.\n\n\nSo next session, I loaded it up and ask it to review the code base, it does so and comes back with \"Areas of the code are well designed and implemented, with clean code and adheres to best practices, but feature XYZ contains numerous errors, technical debt and fails to meet the same stand as the rest of the code\". Feature XYZ was the feature I'd asked it to implement. So at least it was able to identify that it's output was garbage. I did let it have a go at clean up it's mess, but it just made it worse to the point I had to roll back all the changes fir the session and then went and cleaned it up myself. So no time was saved that day.\n\n\nSo lesson here is, just like with juniors, if you give it a well crafted exemplar to learn from, it'll do an acceptable job of implementing code  based on that. But, just like with juniors, if you give it a requirements document and turn it loose on a new feature, it'll get the job mostly done, but it'll be ugly as all hell and need a fair bit of work to get it over the line.\n\n\nBut where the junior wins out is in when you send the work back, show them the exemplar and get them to rework things, the junior won't usually make things worse.",

Some may be lucky enough to find another role internally, but losing your job hurts and is a very stressful time.\n\nA silver lining perhaps is that these losses seem to be Seattle-focused. If laid-off, being in Seattle and a current employee will almost certainly put you at the top of the list for hiring, in the area where the most jobs are.\n\nWhat I'll also add is that it's worth noting where these layoffs have occurred. Devices is a huge org, but many of the divisions are ones where new products were recently launched or are due to be launched. That's not a great look for Amazon, especially if the new versions of Alexa, Zoox, or Kuiper start to suffer issues. It's equally a really shitty look internally if these are successful - why the fuck would you work hard to make something a success when your payoff is losing your job?",

They produce code no where near JR levels and most mid to sr employees spend more time fighting the AI to do basic shit that it takes away from business goals. \n\nOk now why are companies claiming they are getting gains?? Well it's simple. Money. Managers and execs make more money by laying off employees and squeezing the existing labor for all it's worth. And also they know the products are going to be absolutely garbage but they do not give a fuck as long as they have that multi year contract linked.\n\nThey set up deals like a house if cards, demand massive bonuses, pay PR firms to fluff their profiles, then bounce before it all comes down. It's a game of musical chairs and hot potato all at once. That's it.\n\nOh and the final bonus to all this behavior is it brings wages down.

Sounds like you did your best, so you should be proud, even if it's hard.\n\nAnother thing – you are not your work. Maybe it's worth taking some time to consider how much of your personal identity is entangled with producing shareholder value. If you care a lot about that, you'll probably always be a little dissatisfied because shareholder value doesn't give a fuck about you. \n\nIt's okay to feel bad for a few days, but after that, pick your head up and get back to it.

Were there other positions in the company you could have explored, probably.  Could you have helped out other teams, probably.  But the bottom line is, you're a number.  If a company needs to cut corners or decides to move positions offshore, there isn't much you can do about it.  You could have been picked due to performance, salary, age, likability.  You will never know the real reason so don't beat yourself up over it but, be honest with yourself and look at what you could have done differently and learn from that.\n\nGet on the job hunt now and work hard at it.  Don't take time off to lick your wounds.  That will only put you behind.  Job hunting is your full-time job now.  Do all of the things you hear about such as formatting your resume and cover letters for each application.  ChatGPT and Grok make it easy.  It's a stupid game that we all have to play now.  I've had recruiters admit that they only look at the top 3-5 resumes that some AI spits out to them after receiving hundreds.\n\nKeep a log of who you apply to so you have the info handy when a company contacts you 6 weeks later saying your resume impressed them and you have no idea who they are or the position you applied to.  OneNote is great for this.  It also makes it easy and organized to fill out unemployment claims.\n\nStart being frugal with your money now.  Life is expensive and your savings will go fast.\n\nBiggest thing is stay positive.  Looking for a job when you are unemployed is a grueling process and it's easy to get depressed.  That will kill your drive and make things worse.  Get out and be active.  You don't have to spend money to keep yourself fit and engaged in things.

I am dealing with a very tricky health issue, get an appointment at our renowned medical school, only to find out I'll be seen by a NP (nurse practitioner). Not very confidence inspiring never mind my primary care provider is an NP or as my kid calls them, a noctor /s but it's the reality of where healthcare is going (i work software for a large healthcare administration company). \n\nThird, i get the meaningful part. Having worked in the automotive industry for three decades i had the same desire. It does feel meaningful to see your stuff in action.\n\nHaving said all that, I'd say try big pharma, some health tech, and medical devices companies. Or any embedded really, automotive or aerospace. My partner worked 15 years in big pharma manufacturing. Her software helped make many very popular meds.

Even mediocre engineers have landed \\*something\\* after a few months of being laid off.\n\nWhen it comes to senior engineers (5+ YOE), I don't know anyone who's had trouble landing offers (if they're a citizen, considers relocating and open to hybrid).\n\nAs a side note, my team has been interviewing recently and the quality of the candidates we're getting has been pretty bad. Tons of people are blatantly cheating with AI. The majority of the other candidates can't answer basic system design questions, clearly lied during their behavioral interviews, can't solve leetcode medium questions or lied in their application about not requiring sponsorship.

Going into a meeting without you would be like trying to code without Google. When people run into issues they ping you because ***you're Google***.\n\nYou can fix that. Just setting up a random Teams channel and telling them to send their questions there is a start, but it's not enough. Also, it's useless if you keep answering direct-pings. If you get direct pings, politely redirect them to the dev channel. You don't need to come off as if you're avoiding helping them, you can hide it under the guise of \"visibility\" to others.\n\nBut the \"Go-To Person\" at a company that *doesn't* suffer from that is the person management comes to when they need to *get shit done*. They aren't going to waste your talents asnwering stupid questions in a support channel. When there's some really hard task that *needs* to be done fast, and right the first time, they point immediately at the \"Go-To Person\", they don't want to risk giving that ticket to anyone else in the team. You're the tool they use when they don't have any margin for error, because they know you don't need any.\n\n*That's* my experience as the \"Go-To Person\". I always naturally fall into that role, and its great. I've done some awesome things, I've pulled some miracles, I get interesting work, I have the trust of my management. You just have to make sure if you notice things devolving, you establish clear boundaries and process.",

There's always been a bottleneck at juniors as juniors don't make money for companies, they cost money. Companies train juniors so that they can become seniors later and the number of seniors wont go down (causing senior salaries to spike), but now lots of companies are betting on AI becoming the new Seniors of the future so many have stopped investing in creating seniors out of juniors. I\"d say this is incredily short sighted, especially considering the limitations AI is still showing with complex architecture and languages/frameworks/libraries/etc that change more often then the AI models are updated. But I may be naive on that.\n\n>Will this subside, and is a CS degree becoming less worth it?\n\nDepends what happens with AI. Either it will wipe out most development jobs and we'll all be screwed, or it wont and we'll all keep working. There's no way to know because there's no way to know what the AI will be capable of next year, let alone five years down the road.\n\nIf I had to bet, I'd bet on it taking 5-10 years and then AI will be wiping out most jobs, and either societies will have some form of UBI, or societies will be devolving into violence and anger at the rich.\n\nCS degrees are already becoming worth less (not worthless) as our salaries are dropping over the past 3 years, but that doesn't mean people shouldn't learn CS, it's still a good job and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Plus if you like programming, it's a great hobby that you can use to build things you want/like, or create entrepreneurial ventures with. If AI takes over, there wont be money in it, but there wont be money in almost  anything at that point, so you're best off still learning what you enjoy and hoping those in positions of power are smart enough to see the violence coming and giving people a basic living wage paid for by the AI and the rich, then we can spend our free time coding whatever we want for fun.",

This could be a stellar move for your career if this were the case. \n\nThe second, and probably more likely, possibility is less rosy. It’s a team of older engineers who are content to stay in one place and keep the lights on. They‘ve been at this place so long that their COL raises may have forced HR to put them in a higher pay band. \n\nI’ve seen both of these. I left the second one within 5 months and it was damaging to my career. I got paged constantly, there were memory leaks, they were deploying by building artifacts locally and dropping them into prod servers with ftp. You need to figure out what end this falls on.",

The interview process was generally:\n\n* HR Intro Call\n* 1 hour Hiring Manager / Tech Screen\n* On-site panel interview for 2 hours / 2 interviews 1-on-1 with a SWE lasting about 1 hour each\n\nFrankly it's harder to get an offer now, because companies are more picky.  They are scared to death of a false positive hire and will sacrifice the false negative hire all day every day.  I personally think there are tons of talent out there that with some ramp up time on the job would be an excellent SWE.\n\nEvery company I have worked for over my 15 YOE never really had issues hiring once candidates applied. Granted these were non-tech companies in non-tech cities so they were not hiring out of the same pool of candidates as bit tech companies.  If you could do reverse a string level problems with C or C++ you would get an offer. \n\nThese companies were fine with ramp up time and showing candidates, at all levels, what they needed to know to do the job.  Just finding people that had an aptitude for being a SWE was the problem. Aptitude does not mean some rock star coder, but could wrap their head around concepts when shown to them.\n\nGranted I've never applied to a startup, so maybe that world is different.",

        "body": "It is much more a consequence of the company values.\n\nBad work culture and bad work/life balance aren't the same thing than having high operational target metrics.\n\nAmazon has an intentional culture of employees being always working, always tethered to operations, and committing to die at the job. They make you feel bad for taking more than a week of vacation in a year of 12 hours work days. That's more a correlation than a causation but Bezos doesn't see it that way and since he's writing the checks, that's how it works. This is not specific to AWS and affects other areas at Amazon which are less tied to operations. Regardless they built the narrative that such shitty conditions are simply the result of the nature of the job, that if you're not always on the edge of burnout, the business will crumble and the competition will overtake them. Most people have known nothing else so they believe it.\n\nOther sectors and countries have laws so that demanding jobs don't ruin the life of people. For obvious reasons, truckers cannot drive more than X hours per day. Airline pilots must observe rest times, etc. Because obviously pushing these limits isn't good. It doesn't mean we can't have trucks and airplanes, it means we had to find ways to make it work and compensate for the demanding conditions of such jobs, often in the form of regulations against abuses. Companies still find ways to be competitive.\n\nIn some other countries if you are on-duty you need to be compensated for that even if the pager doesn't ring. Being available for the job is considered a work related duty so it needs to be compensated. If you join the call for an incident the law requires the employer to clock hours in addition to your regular pay -- even if you're not an hourly employee. On holidays you get up to double pay. And their online services aren't more or less reliable.\n\nThe US tech has close to no worker protection laws so the only things that retains companies to crush employees is how long they want to keep them and how easily they can find a job elsewhere. That somewhat works if the job market is balanced and companies are compelled to watch wlb to be attractive. This is often made easier by the general American narrative that government is a bad thing, that politics are here to trick us not to protect us, so employees hope for their company to do the right thing by themselves and rarely think about forms of civil action.",

If it’s not mitigated every 15 minutes passed it will page the next in line, so an issue that has been going for an hour would have the VP and like 20 other on call engineers getting yelled at trying to mitigate the issue.

That seems like an extremely arbitrary way to make that distinction, it's just a name. It's not a Professional Engineer license, or any sort of official, legal classification... it's a word.\n\nOnly explanation I can think of is do you have a BS? Or a BSE? Your friend who is pursing a Software Engingeering degree, are *they* getting a BS? or a BSE?\n\nThat *is* an official distinction, it's the type of degree you're getting. A Bachelor of Science vs a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, so maybe that explains it?\n\nComputer Science degrees can fall under either. My CS degree is a BSE for example, but you could get either at my school. If you got your CS degree through the liberal arts school, you'd get a BS. If you got it through the engineering school, you'd get a BSE. But the core program requirements were identical, there was just some minor differences in electives.\n\nIf that's the case, maybe you could consider pursuing an MSE? It sounds like you like your job, and it's a decent gig, so I'd hate for you to leave it just over an arbitrary gate. Have you spoken to your manager about options? Or specifics on the policy?

It's only a matter of time.\n\nWith that knowledge, I hold onto a good WLB for as long as it stays good. I have no interest in job hopping just to make some more money, I already make plenty. When the WLB is good, I couldn't care less if I'm underpaid. I know full well those small 1-5% annual raises don't keep me up with the market, and I'm perfectly OK with that.

Irrespective of market, but it's doubly true in bad markets. If we're talking about $40k to $80k it'd be a different conversation, but $110k to $150k wouldn't cause me to jump ship.\n\nThat's just me though. These are *my* priorities, and *my* goals in life.

Some of the critiscism I am seeing here is true that the problem with this is a new officer of some kind can fire you any day and it can come to a screeching halt so IDK if its really better or worse but my personal view is a chill job where you are not stressed or worried is better.",

No job is perfectly secure. Lots of people who were working for the government, gov. contractors, and research institutions who thought they would have a job forever are now looking. The best job security is the kind you make yourself, by having a diverse skillset and a wide reaching network. Working at different places is the easiest way to do that. \n\n3. there’s absolutely no harm in submitting some resumes and taking a few interviews. You’re actually in the best possible position. You don’t need a job right now, you have one that you like and could stay at. You’re not in any hurry. Only apply for jobs here and there that seem very interesting to you, that meet your preferences (remote, etc.). If you do a couple interviews and git a whiff of bad WLB, bail. If you do go through all the way and get an offer, start your negotiations at a stupid high salary, what do you have to lose?",

But like I said, once your resume is on my desk, I dont care if you have it or not. \n\n\nOther reason to have LinkedIn is it is one of the best ways to stay in touch with coworkers. Layoffs happen and their Slack account is deactivated immediately and you realize you don't have so in so's phone number. LinkedIn is where I message them and check in how they're doing.",

Make it known internally you want some growth on that side. If you’re currently unemployed, it’ll be an uphill battle for sure.

The fact that you are getting on-sites makes me think it's going better for you than you may feel. A lot of people aren't getting call backs or past a first interview. \n\nI imagine the big issues is that you are probably going to be in a junior, or at best, a mid level development position and those are already rare nowadays. I can imagine it would be hard to land a senior position when you don't have proper dev experience. Is there a reason why you haven't tried to pivot to a team lead/management role already? I know that doesn't get you into development, but it could potentially be a smart career move for someone at your level of expertise. \n\nFrom the development side, I do work with someone who switched from sales to dev later in life ( like maybe mid 40s ). He did a bootcamp, but the thing that helped him start getting interviews was contributing to open source projects. They helped him have a commit history he could point to in github and show he was able to work with other developers and follow a bit of a process on a large scale project. He's great and brings a lot to our team and also has a lot of work experience that most of the team doesn't, which is a plus. \n\nI think the biggest issue is finding a team that matches your skillset.Starting out the best position is the one you can get, but you might be at a place in life where you can't take on just any job. You are probably making bigger considerations around time commitments, location, pay, ect.. which might be limiting you a bit. If you have flexibility on any of those, you might be able to expand your search and find something. \n\nAnother option could be to lean harder into your support experience. I'm in the process of transitioning a more support heavy development position. We will have a dedicated support team that will be fully focused on development support. I don't have any hiring capacity for this year unfortunately since it's a very new thing, but I'd be interested in candidates with a heavier support background. Most developers are not interested in doing support, especially when it's something they have to do with some frequency. They want to build and refine features. So, being the person who is both good and support and happy to do it could set you apart if you find the right position/company. \n\nWish I had even better advise. I think it's universally agreed on that getting the first development job is the hardest. One you land that, it'll still be hard, but maybe not as hard as the first time.",

Remove the managers, somebody or something else will continue to pass on the bullshit to you.\n\nBtw in this economy management layers are even more targeted than individual contributors, the narrative now is they are the unnecessary red tape that slows everything down (translation: the company doesn't need them anymore and they cost money). You have more issues in common with them than differences.",

AI, no AI, it doesn't matter, the buck has to stop with someone, and that's a variety of managers.\n\nI do think there is truth to your statement, though. At least at my company, we have no team level managers. I run a team, and I'm a senior engineer. The next layer of management is on the \"team of teams\" level. I do like this, and although a lot of project/product management falls on me when it comes to planning and execution, it's a lot easier when the managers just trust me on the technical details, empower me with a team to get the job done and the right set of people to answer my questions, and just step back and let me do my thing.\n\nIn my role, the managers just worry about goals, and how we allocate resources to go achieve them. For me, that's easy to deal with: everything we do must be towards some goal, I can get that done with the team, and management makes sure that impact/effort ratio remains high.\n\nAfter all, what I want for everyone on my team is to have a good, impactful review period which translates into good reviews. Instead of fighting management, I get a lot further by thinking of them as partners in the process, where trust is a two way street, and we are on the same team. Maybe that's niave, but the only way to be trusted to build anything significant, or lead, is to have a manager agree to the spend.",

It is not a company's responsibility (even though it is great when they help you with it). So when working for companies that do not facilitate this, you must spend your free time. It sucks, yes, but that's just how it is.\n\nI can't tell you what you should learn. You have the skills to figure that out yourself. Look at Stackoverflow's yearly survey and see what people use. Google around a bit. Look at job postings to see what technologies are in demand. Pick something to learn based on what interests you and what seems relevant to you.\n\nAlso, it was due to stagnation that I left my first job, and I have never looked back.",

When I began, I was working primarily in Android development where I would work in Java and some additional Python scripts for automation. Then I worked on another project where I was mainly doing Python and some PowerShell and Bash scripting. After that, I did Python for a while but got exposed to microservice architecture, and found myself working a whole lot with Docker, RabbitMQ, and various other technologies.\n\nAfterwards I pivoted again to a new project which was more web-centric, and found myself developing using Java Spring Boot for the backend, and React for our frontend.\n\nAnother pivot, and I spent quite some time doing Data Science/Analytics for numerous stakeholders; during this time I found myself writing numerous SQL queries, working a lot in Jupyter Notebook in Python, and also dabbling in Machine Learning.\n\nMy most recent pivot I've been working with Django to build a web service, and again working with microservice architecture, and doing a whole lot of database work again.\n\nMy transitions have been quite extreme over the last several years, going from embedded systems, to data science/ML, to web development, and so on.

        "body": "So, I'm 5 years deep into my career, which I hope gives me a good amount of perspective without being grizzled and jaded. Most of it was as a developer at a boutique consulting firm, and I stuck with the same client for about 3 years, a large at home healthcare company. Then bounced around other clients for a little over a year before we had a bad quarter and a headcount reduction. I got another job within the month building business software at a major auto manufacturer. \n\nAll that said, here's something I wish I knew 5 years ago. \n\nThe technical stuff, coding, architecture, deployments, are NOT the toughest part of the job. There's a good chance that coding is the easiest part of your work. It's working with and meeting the often inconsistent expectations of clients, product managers, stakeholders, and business analysts that will make your job hard. But, the good thing about that, is the better you learn to understand these people's perspectives and speak their language instead of nerd gibberish, you will be so much more valuable to your team. It's one thing to be a good coder, but when you're a good coder who can get the non-technical decision makers on your side, you become the person who GETS THINGS DONE. \n\nI inherited my current position from someone who was a good developer, but a really poor communicator. He didn't set expectations and just said whatever he needed to so people would stop asking him to explain. He developed a notorious reputation in the other departments as someone who didn't make sense and couldn't deliver. The tough part was he actually was a good developer, but people who didn't trust him tried to get in his way. \n\nLong story short, even though you're a developer, educate yourself in the business as a whole. Ask people from other departments about what they do and what their pain points are. Take their perspectives into account when it's appropriate and let them know that you're doing that (in a humble way, of course). You'll be an asset to the company as a whole and unique opportunities may open up.",

If you don't know something, anything that you don't know how to do/don't get/understand, ask for help. Do a bit of research first but do not spend more than an hour. If you are clueless on something even after an hour, just ask for help\n\n\\- When you have learned something new, take notes on it\n\n\\- Work on challenging tickets. It's the best way to learn things quickly\n\n\\- If you are working with a tech stack/tools you are not familiar with/you are new to it, work on a project that uses the tech stack/tools\n\n\\- Before you do something like make a PR for instance, ask what the company's convention/process is. Sometimes they may want you to write a PR in a certain way as an example. This goes for documentation, git commits, code as well. Pretty much anything where you need to do something for the company\n\n\\- Don't focus so much on documenting things when you are working on a ticket. Document for you, not for the company. But if the senior dev asks you to document something, then document. E.g., say you are working on something new, don't spend so much time neatly documenting an activity diagram or a sequence diagram. Focus on the dev work. If the company wants you to create a documentation, then document it. Not all documentation are useful for the company\n\n\\- Don't share anything personal/personal life issues. Colleagues may form negative opinions about you. This is like fitting into the company politics, if you don't fit, then you may be seen undesirable from a social point of view. Just keep it positive and professional\n\n\\- Company may have certain events or even activities like weekly soccer or board games. They may even have an internal committee where they are responsible for holding team related events/activities. Join them to maintain and improve relationships with the people in your company\n\n\\- At least when I did my internship, they valued efficiency. If you can complete work quickly and if you are able to take on work quickly, you will be seen as a highly valuable employee, you will get promoted easily\n\nThat's all I can think of right now, I may add more if I can think of anything else.",

You have that half in spades, you definitely are working hard and maybe a bit too hard (5000 applications in 8 months is nuts, thats close to 160 applications daily without any breaks). The other half is working smart. When you are looking for a job, you are selling your particular skillset to the company. Do you reflect on the applications that you do send in or do you just mass apply? How are you proving to the companies that you are sending these applications that you are indeed the best candidate?\n\nI am not saying that all of this is your fault either, the job market is fucked, but you don't control the market and neither do I, I am simply saying the things that are in your control which should be the primary focus.\n\nFor the masters question, do you think it will lower your chances, raise your chances, or keep them the same? That is how I would make my decision. If you answer that you don't know then you should be asking yourself questions to find out. For example, if you are looking to hire a software engineer and you see 2 resumes that are identical except for the education section where one has a masters degree in computer science listed and one that has a boot camp degree that is listed, which one would you personally choose? Imo the answer is pretty clear there.\n\nYou have to remember I don't know you though, don't take what I am saying personally. I could go the route of telling you how unfair everything is and how I feel bad for you but that doesn't solve anything in relation to you having a job so I tried my best to instead challenge your process since its the only thing you control.",

Surprisingly, my job applications are performing worse now on platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed than they did back when I was still in high school and only knew basic Python, plus a bit of JavaScript and Java.\n\nPeople often suggest networking, and while that advice holds some truth, it's a double-edged sword in a metropolitan area. On one hand, there are more people and potential connections. On the other hand, interactions tend to feel impersonal and transactional. Stories like mine aren’t uncommon. Many peers I know have moved to places like Texas, California, or Florida in search of better opportunities.\n\nEven my career center and professors, many of whom have extensive industry experience, are surprised I haven’t landed something yet. I don’t mean to sound like I’m bragging, but it really speaks to how tough the job market is right now, especially in a place like NYC.\n\nThat said, I wouldn’t say you’re out of luck, especially if you’re in a close-knit suburban area where networking feels more genuine. In many ways, that can be an advantage over the more isolated experience of job hunting in a big city.",

I don't work frontend so I don't know for sure how obscure electron is, but it's not one of the languages/frameworks I have heard of. Because your company is small you likely lack the branding. You're ultimately looking for a candidate who has experience in a more niche framework, high risk/low stability role (unless you have a ton of funding), probably paying average or below average rate. You're bringing to the table \"pretty laid back environment, with great team\". That might sound good to you, but it's not a strong selling point.\n\nYou have to be realistic with the talent you can attract (and hang on to).

The tradeoff here is that for above pay band talent, you need to invest in training them, or at least hire someone who can self-onboard.\n* Offer the use of technology, like Rust, or Haskell, or anything else, that people will pay a passion tax for. I'm not sure if Electron is this, and this is more a decision that needed to have been made when picking out the tech stack.\n* Offer responsibilities and ownership far above what the level of talent you are looking for would otherwise get. A decent mid or junior can make bank and work for a company where they are insulated from all decision making\n\nI work at a big tech company, but pound for pound, the best dev team I've ever been on was at a Haskell start up: nearly everyone was a career changer, and loved Haskell. That love of the language was a requirement, and we got some really awesome people.\n\nWhat's also important to consider, is that you are making an offer to the market, and the simplest way this problem is solved is just more money.",

        "body": "System design is definitely a unique beast, but with some persistence and practice, it's totally doable. One thing that might help is to start by reading up on some basic concepts like scaling, latency, and capacity planning. GeeksforGeeks has some great articles on these topics that can give you a solid foundation.\n\nAlso, try watching some system design interview prep videos on YouTube (e.g., System Design Primer or Cracking the Coding Interview). They cover a lot of the same ground as LeetCode problems but in a more theoretical sense. As for actual practice, start by trying to design a simple system like a blog comment section or a user authentication system - it'll help you get your feet wet with thinking through scalability and performance.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper, I've used an AI tool that listens to system design interview questions and suggests responses in real time. If you're interested, I can share it with you. Keep at it, and don't worry if it takes a few weeks or even months to get the hang of it - the more you practice, the better you'll understand these concepts!",

That'd be the better of the two options.\n\nHonestly, if you just want to maximize your chances of getting a job:\n\n1. Pick one major and do it really well. CS is ideal, but Data Science is totally fine.\n\n2. Do projects, go beyond what's required in class. Be curious. Try to really understand things.\n\n3. Apply for internships every summer. Do everything you can to get an internship. Use your career center, reach out to alums who graduated from your school recently, make friends with pros via open-source projects.\n\nUltimately those things matter more than a double-major or master's.\n\nDo the master's if you really want to learn some of the material that goes beyond undergraduate CS or DS, and you really want to learn it in an academic environment. Don't do it expecting an easier time finding a job or a higher salary, it won't help. However, it might be worth it if the subfield you want to go into is really advanced.",

If things don't seem to be moving forward and improving over the next few years that may be my sign to move on, but I do like the people I work with and the company is very enthusiastic about any engagement. Just asking for learning materials seemed to be viewed very positively, and dedication looks to be well rewarded here. It seems like poor management has led to stagnation, and the team is all fairly new to working on this specific project so there's absolutely room to grow.

If you don't like it, find something you like. Coding isn't the money making jackpot it was seen as before, but if you like coding, it will be fun and useful even if AI wipes out the industry, knowing how computers work and how to get them to do what you want will always be a positive, it just might not always be a viable career. But it should be remembered that if AI becomes \"smart\" enough to wipe out coding, it will be wiping out a **lot** of jobs, coding gets the most news articles about it, but there are very few industries or jobs that AI wont be better at than humans. If Coding as a career is over, so are most careers, at that point, either society allows us to live with a UBI and coding can be a pretty cool hobby, or societies wont allow us to live and revolution will be the cool hobby. \n\nIf you want to \"AI proof\" yourself, learn 2-3 diffent jobs in different areas. Like coding, wood working, and farming. Coding if tech keeps growing. wood working if it doesn't. And farming in case things go real bad....",

It doesn't grant unique access to a field in the way that accounting or engineering do, but it's a bit more accessible for people and can still be great.\n\nUltimately, if you're doing this for job security and money then accounting or engineering might be better simply because a lot of jobs in those fields are locked behind a hard CPA/PE requirement, both of which require a specific degree. If you have passion woven in there, I bet you can make CS work.",

But if you do enjoy problem-solving and are interested in software development, QE/SDET can be a great career path.\n\nThat being said, the tech industry is always changing, and QE/SDET roles at FAANG companies can be super competitive. It's possible that some people had bad experiences during the mass hiring era, but it sounds like your interview with this team was really positive. I would say that if you're genuinely interested in the role and think you'd be a good fit, it might be worth exploring further.\n\nOne thing that helped me when I was in a similar spot was using this AI tool that listens to interview questions and provides suggested responses in real time - it's not a magic solution, but it can help you feel more prepared. If you're interested, I can share it with you. Keep going and don't be afraid to ask for feedback or advice from people who have been through the process - good luck!",
