Open the reports/dashboards the next day, and it was basically DOA. \n\nSo I go to the digital marketing manager guy doing the project and said \"hey man, there's like nothing happening here wtf?\" And he said \"Oh sorry the marketing launch got pushed by two weeks, but we forgot to tell you\".

You see Google moving in with their Data Transfer service.  Every cloud has always had a model of 'cheap to put stuff into it and expensive to take it out' it only makes sense that they would look at Fivetran and say 'we could offer this for way cheaper by only supporting our own cloud and making up the profit on extra usage/storage in our cloud after the data is there.  So they need to diversify.",

We thought SQLMesh might be that thing, but now I'm leaning towards something like [Kedro+Ibis](https://kedro.org/blog/building-scalable-data-pipelines-with-kedro-and-ibis)\\+[BSL](https://juhache.substack.com/p/the-boring-semantic-layer), and/or higher level abstraction that can be AI-native, with built-in best practices.\n\nI'm confident in the future of open source data transformations because of two things:\n\n1. **Existing users are fine.** If and when Fivetran tries to monetize dbt to the detriment of its users, the community will almost certainly **fork** dbt-core to maintain its openness (gratis+libre) for the longterm. However, the investments from the dbtLabs folks will almost certainly slow down or stop. Which means dbt may be staleware in a few years.\n2. **Necessity is the mother of invention.** The acquisition alone is reason to inspire others to build higher-level abstractions that don't inherit dbt's innate weaknesses. *(Does anyone really think dbt+Jinja was the ideal solution?)* The next generation of transformation solutions should accomplish more with less code, and with semantic metadata baked in.\n\nI've built three dbt clones in my career, two of which were *before* dbt itself launched, and one of which was successfully [patented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10846284B1/en) during my time at Amazon AWS. I am eternally thankful to dbt because it was the first CI/CD-friendly transformation tool to reach critical market share. The dbt team proved to the world that \"transformations as code\" is viable and that data pipelines are not incompatible with SDLC best practices.\n\nThe future has been changed for the better because dbt exists, but dbt is neither the only solution nor the best solution for the problems data engineers face today and tomorrow.\n\nThere will be more and better solutions on the horizon. 😎",

Photon, catalyst, etc. won’t do it for you. There is an enormous amount of electricity and money burning out there in unoptimized Spark jobs, where a traditionals RDBMS SQL shop was convinced they can unlock 20% performance by just migrating to Databricks, whereas with a little investment they could achive 10x+ faster and more efficient jobs.

Don’t rush to “scale up” with Databricks when you could model cleanly with dbt and keep the “small” data that breaks down easily in fully managed platforms like Snowflake.\n\nMost companies don’t need complex, custom reports. Pre-aggregated APIs and recent data (7–30 days) often cover 90% of use cases. That way, it will be affordable.\n\nIf stakeholders flood you with requests, remember: those “quick asks” can become long term data headaches. Raise the flag early as some things just don’t have enough ROI to maintain.\n\nIf the company truly needs heavy customization, build a real data team. Otherwise, stay lean. Not every data problem needs a big data solution.",

If the setup delivers value (aka if we shut it down how desperate are the people) it opens up more budget. As someone said here, saying no becomes essential. Or better ask why they need this data, what actions are they planning to derive from it. Ask them if the metric they ask for is dropping by 20% what are they planning to do.

I have regular flare-ups of imposter syndrome, but have come to realize this usually happens under high negative pressure from unrealistic deadlines, poisonous office politics, or when I’m simply ill or haven’t been sleeping enough. The good days by far offset the bad ones, and I’ll realize that there are plenty of essential skills and experience that I bring to the table that typical CS profiles bring less of: e.g. engineers tend to ‘tunnel’ into technical problem solving and often struggle to zoom out and grasp the broader domain context. I have experience in multiple business process domains and in financial management, which in turn drives (executive) decision making. If you don’t grasp that, you can design fantastic technical solutions, but won’t ever get top down support to fund and execute against them.\n\nSo, we can all learn from each other and together we create success. In my spare time I dig into my team’s code and do engineering training/certifications to learn more about that space and better lead my teams by asking better questions. \n\nI cannot judge whether you’re too far out of your depth in your current role, or whether you’re simply suffering the discomfort that actually indicates that you’re in the ‘learning zone’. That’s up to you to figure out. Just don’t be afraid to fail and don’t walk away out of fear. And take care of your physical and mental health while you’re working on your professional growth.

You'll learn by shipping stuff.\n1b - Yes learn DBT\n1c - Don't think about it just ship.\n\n2a - Get a solid, easy to expand ETL/ELT service going. Adding more data to your DW should be *easy*. When non-data people come to you with \"oh I wanted to see X data that's not on the DW\", you should be like \"oh I'll get it there for you\" and within a few bizdays it's there. Have an ELT/ETL layer that's simple and easy to expand, and this sort of interaction will happen.\n\n2b - You should be chilling in your spare time, you'll learn all you need by working on building the stuff that's just beyond what you can comfortably deliver right now. Progressive overload. Don't settle, but don't try to reach for the moon right away. Build yourself a ladder first.\n\n2c - Just build stuff, and when the subject come up you say you're learning data engineering on the fly, out of necessity.\n\n\nIf you're doing any sort of data-related study in your spare time, I recommend the more theoretical, foundational stuff. Kimball's data modelling, Klepmann's Data Intensive Applications, SICP. This sort of mind-expanding work that makes you stop thinking about code (trees) and start thinking about systems, data transport, semantics, read/write patterns (the forest).",

Revive dbt for staging, marts, incremental models on large tables, tests (unique/not null, referential), and source freshness; publish dbt docs so Metabase fields have descriptions. Start scheduling with GitHub Actions or a simple EC2 cron, then move to Step Functions or MWAA; add alerts via SNS. Point Metabase at marts only, use segments/metrics, row-level security for client views, and pre-aggregated tables with indexes to speed dashboards. Call out bad practices: reporting off OLTP, manual Excel copies, shared creds, no environments, laptop crons, no backfill plan, inconsistent IDs, and sloppy PII access. Learn IAM, S3, RDS, Lambda, Step Functions, Terraform basics, CDC with DMS/Debezium, and Kimball + SQL tuning.

If you don't consider how you want to manage Infrastructure in this new world you get to great my advice would be look at a reference architecture for a lake house on AWS. Ask your company to send you to re:Invent in December take hands onlabs for building data lakes (avoid any sales sessions just do hands on labs) you will come out with a better idea of what to do. Also take a BASIC terraform course. It will make everything better. It will be confusing at first but ChatGPT/Claude will get you most of the way there. AWS + Python gives you A LOT of options. IMO DBT is kinda shitty. SQL ETL's are ass, because you cannot really unit test these things effectively. Focus more on python (it will get you 90% of what you need for most use cases) look at serverless event driven architectures, less work less thinking long term but you need to monitor that shit and make sure the SPICE FLOWS! Postgres is fine. Your use cases determine your data persistence. If you don't have a lot of data don't over complicate shit use and RDBMS + Python, geter done.\n2. look back at 1. I personally don't think much of DEs that focused on DBT or Databricks they usually don't know much....sorry to say that but it's the truth. I want coders. I want people who understand distributed systems. I don't care if people know Redshift of Snowflake as long as they understand what those systems are...MPPs. That's abstracted from most DEs. It means Sr folks have to learn ya some shit about an MPP like redshift and snowflake both great infra but they cost and abstract aspects of what's going on under the hood. They are not a golden hammer. Look at the use cases. Postgres on aurora can bang out A LOT of DE use cases. Don't buy a destroyer class ship to manage bass fishing :D\n\nb. pyspark is a good thing to pick up. Understand when you want a python script v a pyspark script to run a job. Understand shit like Airflow and how you split compute from your orchestration layer. Airflow is not an ETL it's orchestration. ELT work and computer is done on other infra like an AWS lambda. As you go further focus on microservices, apis, event driven architectures stuff like that. \n\nc. AWS tools are legit DE tools you just gotta look at the right shit. Get a cursory understanding  these AWS servies (timebox yourself to a few hours  total here) EventBridge, Kinesis, Manage Ariflow, managed kafka, lambdas, glue, redshift. aurora(postgresql). Athena.  You can solve pretty much all problems with these with out really managing much infra. I can count on one hand the number of times my serverless systems have died in production....AWS went down  each time :D.....that was a long one DM me I am an old hand. Happy to answer questions.\n\nPS avoid Pandas unless you are working on small scale stuff it's a fucking huge package with way more stuff than you need in most cases. That said it's super convenient to bang out small tasks on small contianers.",

Doesn’t matter if you have a schema management system but the engineers only update it after they’ve broken the system. \n\nIf this is your first job and you’re the only DE, it may be difficult to implement good process. \n\nBut it’s a small company—not super unwieldy yet. So get in there and set higher expectations for everyone—if they want their data to be reliably available, they need to not break things in production without sufficient notice. \n\nIf this situation persists, you will eventually get so caught up in fixing things on an ad hoc basis that you’ll never get anything new built. \n\nYour CTO is not wrong—you should ALSO build tests to reject the bad data input when it fails and alert you to the new state. Ideally a failed test rolls back the data back to a prior stable state. Bad data shouldn’t break the downstream system, it should be rejected. The feasibility of that will depend on your specific system.\n\nEdit; also…what is the development process like? Are there separate dev/test/prod environments where you can get pulled in earlier via PR’s?\n\nBreaking changes shouldn’t get that far without anyone being notified.",

Ideally, this should be an exact replica of production in order to address the exact challenge you raise.\n\nTo ensure that your code changes aren't breaking things, you should have some sort of data unit testing framework as well. The way I typically tackle this is to have a tiny, but representative, csv of data for each source table. Key tables (marts, facts, entities etc.) throughout my DAG also have csv files of expected outputs. When making code changes, run the sample source data through your pipeline and verify that the output table still matches the contents of your csv of expected results. Or that the updates you've made to your csv of expected results are indeed what emerges from your DAG.\n\nA big part of my dbt evangelism arises from the fact that implementing the above is quite handy when using dbt. But it's also doable regardless of your stack if you take the time to build the framework for it.",

From your BI tool's perspective this'll be as if there are denormalized tables, but when the tool queries these tables the view will be executed.\n   * This works if your data is small, but it gets harder to maintain, debug, and scale for larger datasets.\n* The more maintainable alternative here is to build a \"data pipeline\":\n   * The pipeline would get the raw data from the production systems, as well as any other external systems you need data from.\n   * Builds data models using SQL and Python and persists them into the database.\n   * Your BI tools then connects to the modeled tables instead.\n   * This allows the queries to be more efficient and faster, since the data is pre-calculated.\n   * This also makes analyzing this data easier in BI usecases.\n   * The added benefit of this is that if you want to use a different BI tool tomorrow, or if you need to use this data in some other way than a BI tool, such as jupyter notebooks and python scripts, then the data is also usable for that.\n\nThere are a bazillion different tools that allow you to build data pipelines. In your case, it could be as simple as starting with a few views on your Postgres database, and see how it works. Once you run into performance issues or any other trouble, you can consider persisting the data with a proper data pipeline.",

There are three options in the market today - (1) dynamic tables in snowflake, (2) delta live tables in databricks, and (3) tabsdata that also does ingestion.\n\nGiven that you are just starting out and may not be in one of the big data platforms, try tabsdata.

It has an SQL query engine (optionally serverless) based on a proprietary, massively parallel processing columnar database engine and an old fork of PostgreSQL 8. It has its own specific table storage optimizations such as distribution styles and sort keys. It is designed for data warehousing and BI.\n\nAthena is newer (2016), and solely a query engine (based on open-source Trino by default, or Spark), so you need to manage the data storage in another tool, such as S3. It's designed for interactive querying on data lakes, while Glue is designed for ETL. Although it doesn't mean you can't use Athena for transformations, I just would not bet that it will be cheaper than Glue (serverless Spark) for production ETLs. The design of interactive query tools is usually made to be faster in exchange for more resources consumption, which may not be the best trade-off for production ETLs.\n\nRunning Spark on EMR may be a cheaper way to run distributed SQL transformations on AWS, but then you have to deal with EMR cluster management.",

What’s worked for me: define the line you’ll pay for (SSO, SOC2, SLA’d support, on-call), and measure internal cost in hours; when upkeep crosses that, buy. Put escape hatches in contracts (export everything, 90-day license change notice, no feature-only lock-in) and keep a self-hosted path warm with IaC and a quarterly failover drill. Standardize on portable interfaces to reduce switching pain (Kafka API, Parquet on S3, Trino/ANSI SQL). Watch vendor risk signals: neutral governance, license history, bus factor, cadence, and how many third-party integrations exist. Airbyte handles ingestion and Trino covers federated queries; DreamFactory auto-generates secure REST APIs over our databases so product teams can ship without bespoke ETL. In short, treat OSS like any dependency: budget it, monitor it, and always have an exit plan.",

Saying you have too much on is completely alright (provided you have too much on) and then you have to present them alternatives e.g. there is too much work and all of it can't be completed at the same time without more resource.  If I get more resource, then fine.  If I don't get more resource, what do you want to be prioritised and who do we need to let know that this isn't going to be on time.",

Edit: I see that you say the MI has Admin permission in the Fabric workspace, so you should be covered there already. If the notebook and warehouse are in different workspaces, the MI will probably need at least Contributor in both workspaces. It doesn't need to have any permissions on the capacity.\n\nPerhaps the .synapsesql() just doesn't work when triggered by MI. This seems to be a related case: https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Warehouse/Service-Principal-Getting-quot-HTTP-request-forbidden-quot-When/m-p/4832636\n\nAs a workaround, you can write to a Lakehouse table (and, if you insist on using a Warehouse, you can use API to do a metadata sync of the Lakehouse SQL Analytics Endpoint and then load the data from the Lakehouse SQL Analytics Endpoint into the Warehouse using a T-SQL script/stored procedure).\n\nRe: Storage blob contributor.

Finding yourself reusing the same default arguments put it in a variable and import across dags. If you find you need to change common elements in that variable put the definition in a function with parameters. \n\nSame thing with open telemetry or open lineage, define your structure for making the call and do it once. A big advantage of this is structure, everything looks the same data is captured in a uniform way and simplifies your life a ton. Depending on your size this can start as simple parameters but may evolve into some kind of log class that you pass as a parameter. \n\nWord of warning stay away from template files. I've worked with too many teams that start doing templates to try and enable non engineers to just drop in SQL or something and it makes life miserable. Speeds up initial work but it will cause a lot of headaches down the road with unmaintained, unoptimized code and leaves you with a swampy mess of data.\n\nKeep a good folder structure. Don't put your orchestration code in the same folder as your data quality code. Favor nested folders. That ELT folder you have probably has sub components maybe by source, domain, project or whatever else makes sense for your team and size. \n\nTLDR; Break things up, software design principles apply to data engineering as well.

You can spin up literally all of these in a Single Docker container or 3 seperate containers and let your job run.\n\nIf you want to go one step ahead and build dashboards, you can add Apache Superset.",

That way you end up with more clarity on which column goes to what.  And optionally, you can prefix each column name with the role play if that works best for your reporting tool.

DynamoDB works well (GSIs on status/source + TTL for old versions), though Postgres is fine if you want richer queries. In Temporal, run per-document workflows with chunking/embedding as children; batch Qdrant upserts and use idempotency keys like hash(docid|chunkidx|embedversion). Keep S3 versioning and a manifest so you can replay safely. In Qdrant, index payload fields (docid, version), and retire old vectors by version when a doc changes.

In the modern data world partitioning should be approached with the following mindset: read patterns (increasing read performance by partition pruning), data distribution i.e. your partitioning should make sense in terms of how you organize the data in files AND partitions (avoiding small files and data skew, but also creating enough optimal sized files so you can parallelize reading), and considering your deployment/compute sizing so you can actually take advantage of the things you can do in parallel and scale accordingly (again has to do with how you organize your data in files). \nAlthough partitioning is a tool you can also use to “group” and “label” your data, like you mentioned, - e.g. being able to reprocess a subset of your data based on a label (processing time) - I would discourage you from using it like this. You have other tools for this purpose that will not hurt performance in the long run. Use partitioning as intended: a tool to distribute your data to ensure performant reads and scalability.\n\n2. If you don’t need an immutable bronze data use a lakehouse format straight away like Iceberg and do updates/merge. Optimize for copy-on-write or merge-on-read based on the volume of your late or dupe data. Do proper table maintenance for healthy filesizes and valuable snapshots. (This equals to SCD type 1 btw)\nIf you need the raw data, you can do CDC in an extra column or in a side table. Just like in a regular DWH. You trade downstream performance for history granularity. (This is SCD type 2+)\n\n\nNote: Iceberg/Delta/Hudi are gold because they bring SQL and data warehousing back to big data.\n\n3. Look at 1.\n\n\nFor idempotency you can also implement watermarking or something with the snapshoting/tagging/branching features of your lakehouse format. This “metadata” can carry the same information that you want to implement with the “processing time” partitioning. These are all small things that can help you, but ultimately idempotency and deterministic behavior should be achieved on the data pipeline level with whatever tools you have. Don’t sculpt your data to make your life easier when coding data pipelines, shape it to make it friendly for the consumers.",

If you're okay with a short downtime then you could even just drop and recreate the Postgres table. You could probably just use CSV files so you maintain native support for the Postgres commands.\n\nThe memory consideration on the server is, IMHO, a bit ridiculous for data this small; sounds like a problem you'd have in like 2004. Just do whatever you need; seriously doubt there will be issues with memory unless the server is really underpowered.\n\nBTW, an `updated_at` column in the source is exactly how this situation is typically handled so then you can store a \"high water mark\" (last update datetime handled) so you know which new records to import when your job re-runs. That's a major problem if that field is invalid. If you can talk to whoever is managing the mysql db, tell them to stop updating every row, if possible, as that seems like a mistake or at least an anti-pattern.

That way you can just work around any issues which have to do with what records to copy and just fully replicate the table. (It isn't efficient but unless your tables are super wide, a few million rows should be fast to load into a new table, especially if you drop the indexes first.)",

They said you get throttled, and then I walked them through a hypothetical which clearly showed that F64 is unlikely to work for us. We run 100s of workspace and cover multiple clients over multiple sectors globally.\n\nNot even 2 hours later, one of my clients who have moved over to Fabric (not sure of their capacity, but probably F64, since that is the flavour MS lead the pitch calls with), started having issues with dashboards and my analysts just sent me laughing emoji saying 'we where just talking about this...' and included a screen grab where you could see their dashboards where timing out because of capacity limits.\n\nAnyway, previously the enterprise option would have been great, and we would have gotten that, but that is a different story...\n\nFabric, personally, not sold on.

I inherited a Synapse environment, struggled with all the weirdness of it for a couple of years, and then found Microsoft changing directions (again) on their home grown data stack, to Fabric, without any real clear guidance or easy way of migrating.\n\nSo I didn't. I just setup my own stack using Azure's base resources(basic storage accounts, containerized and function apps, Azure SQL, data factory for orchestration) that were less likely to be discontinued every few years and then let the business choose what BI solution they wanted to move to.\n\nIt ended up cutting our costs to like 1/4th of what I had projected it to be at if we would have migrated to Fabric. At the time, there was no migration plan for users of older Synapse to Fabric and it was going to be a re-implementation for us anyways.\n\nWhile I wish Microsoft the best with Fabric, if it's anything like the product model they had for Synapse, it will be dead in like 5 years too. Synapse utilized many of Azure's base resources all linked together, but their development was forked and specialized to Synapse - so they're not 1:1 migrations. To further add problems to this, based on feature requests we made and escalated support tickets to engineering, the development of those forks were done by a small overseas team that basically had no bandwidth but bug fixes. Which is why the actual number of features implemented in Synapse past its first year were non-existent, and why everything was so quirky in it.",

You want to be conditioning your brain to long periods of mental focus on complex things - you're working out your brain just like a powerlifter goes to the gym to build muscle. Getting someone else to lift the weights for you - or getting AI to solve problems for you - actively works against what you're trying to do.\n\nAnyway, you absolutely can learn without AI and you'll learn faster and better without it (AI is good for tricking people into thinking they've learned something when they really haven't). Learning from books (while constantly trying things out yourself and seeing how they work) remains one of the best ways (second really only to being guided through by a quality instructor).",

I played through all of [https://nandgame.com](https://nandgame.com) and that really helped since after you play through that you have built a computer from scratch. I also later found the game Turing Complete on Steam, playing through that would make you understand all the low-level things. And I built my own 8-bit computer in hardware description language after that which helped cement all of it. Courses in hardware description language, electronics and Assembly (and C/Assembly) and \"embedded\" as they call it probably good to really be able to reason about things.

Your code just says \"print this character\", the libraries say \"call the OS specific routine for printing characters\", the OS says \"hey VGA card/bios, print this character on the screen\".  All of this code can be written in the same language, ultimately everything is just machine code when it hits the CPU\n\nWe provide the layers for convenience, not because they are necessary",

The special thing about a system call is that it allows *user* code (running with low privileges) to call *kernel* code (running with high privileges) in a controlled way.\n\nThe kernel can \"receive\" syscalls from user code, but within the kernel itself, plain old function calls are used. If you read the source code for Linux, which is written in C, you'll mostly just see a lot of functions calling other functions.\n\nIn terms of what those function calls within the kernel actually *do*: sometimes they just manipulate data, like any other function you might write yourself. For instance, the \"list of running processes\" is a kernel data structure, so when you start a new process running with the `fork` and `exec` syscalls, you're just calling kernel code that adds a new entry to that list.\n\nSimilarly, when you use a syscall like `write` to \"print\" text from your program, normally what you're really doing is writing characters to a queue (a.k.a. a pipe or FIFO). Some other part of the system (e.g. a terminal emulator) is going to read those characters and figure out how to display them on the screen. The queue itself belongs to the kernel, so programs use syscalls to ask the kernel to read and write it.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the kernel code has to manipulate hardware. It usually does this by accessing special memory addresses ([memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O)) which read or write the corresponding registers in a hardware device. The kernel's higher privilege level allows it to do this directly. User code is normally forbidden from doing this by the CPU's memory protection hardware.",

Except when eating something, the tail is not removed.

        "body": "Strictly speaking, you don't need both for-loops and while-loops.  In fact, when I was young and the only programming language I knew was BASIC, I realized that you didn't even need FOR-loops; you could accomplish the same thing with just IF-statements and GOTOs.\n\nSo why did BASIC use FOR loops at all?  Because sometimes you want a loop that iterates using a counter variable, and writing a FOR-loop makes it so much easier to write and read than using only IFs and GOTOs.\n\nOkay, so why do some languages also use while-loops in addition to for-loops?  Because sometimes the logic you want to implement is clearer as a for-loop with a counter and/or current element, and sometimes the logic is clearer as a loop that continues *while* a condition remains true.\n\nSome programming languages allow the use of an *until*\\-loop, a loop that keeps running *until* a condition is met.  An until-loop is functionally equivalent to a while-not-loop, so why is there a need for an until-loop?\n\nWell, it's not that there's a specific *need* for it, it's that sometimes the logic is clearer when you realize that a body of code needs to be repeated over and over *until* a specific condition is met -- or that the body needs to repeatedly execute with the goal of causing that condition to be true.",

Put enough time in, and you'll get there.\n\nWhat some people are \\*born\\* with I think, is the kind of mind that finds this stuff compellingly interesting. Not everybody working on open source is doing it so they can put something on their CV. Most aren't. Most just enjoy solving the problem.\n\nIn 2025, I have now started to advise people that if this is not you, if you don't actually have this interest and are instead just looking for comfortable, well-paid employment, think carefully.

It was fun to think about how to solve the problem, what kinds of things I'd want the app to do, and then write it. We decided that we'd have a web interface for adding/deleting items, and then QR-codes embedded in the box labels so my wife could point her phone at a box and \"see\" the contents.\n\nMy daughter, a comp-sci sophomore at the local university, helped me code and debug it, which was also a really fun father/daughter experience. We're currently in the middle of adding the 40 or so boxes from our storage room to the inventory. When we're done, we'll be able to find stuff (Funny story, while opening boxes to add items to the app, we've discovered stuff we'd forgotten we had).\n\nI work in tech, but I am not a programmer.

This forces your brain to recall actively rather than just re-reading.\n\nAlso, focus on understanding the logic and pattern behind a problem rather than the exact code. If you can explain the approach in words or pseudocode, you’ll remember it better and can reconstruct the code when needed.\n\nThen, reimplement problems from scratch without looking at your old code.

Did the Odin Project to learn as much as possible and then build a digital shift planer that we now use at the company I work at (I am a warehouse worker). I also won a company award for it. Also built several mobile Apps for myself with React Native and of course many small projects that were part of Odin Project. Currently building an App that me and a friend of mine plan to turn into a company. \n All in all I spent almost 3000 hours with programming so far over almost 2 years. I had many highs and many lows in that time. Imo the most important thing is persistence, to sit myself down and do the work even if I don't feel like it has been the most important thing in these 2 years.",

C++ is an older language and probably provides a better understand of some concepts like memory management and resources. Java is typically used for more full stuck development positions, while C++ is generally used more for embedded systems. Do either one of them interest you more than the other? \n\nThings to consider:\n\n* Is it one or the other or will you be taking both eventually? If both take the C++ one first since the lower level concepts may be easier to learn before you've learned the higher level concepts. If you can only take one programming class ever, I think the concepts in Java are more important to modern programming. \n* Do you know anything about the teachers? All things equal I'd pick the class with the better teacher. A good teacher makes it more engaging to learn.  \n* If your a CS major or need to take later classes, which class will be more important to your next ones? If you need to take Java 101 and then Java 102 then opt for Java, but if you're going to be an EE and never take a programming class again then maybe C++ is the better choice. \n* Which one sounds more appealing to you?\n* Are you more interested in embedded systems and high perfomance computing (C++) or modern applications and web development (Java)? \n\nFor me personally, the concepts in C++ were useful to learn, but I've very rarely had to worry about things like memory management and performance in my jobs.",

Rarely can you get all three at once.\n\nObject-oriented programming and functional programming are approaches for managing system complexity. With OOP, you're defining components as \"objects\" with specific functionalities so that you have a system-wide vocabulary for what things do. Furthermore, by making things modular, you limit how much you have to fit in your head at any one time in order to change the system.\n\nWith functional programming, you're trying to isolate state to as few places as possible and keep all your functions throughout your system simple and deterministic, so when you're writing a function you have a finite number of ways that function can behave and it's simple to create, write, and test.\n\nI have met very few engineers who understand why OOP and FP are desirable. They just follow them dogmatically because they were taught them in college and don't know how to do things another way. Furthermore, they often do them wrong. They think simply using functions is FP or just defining boilerplate objects is OOP without actually writing coherent modules to reduce system complexity.\n\nIf you'd like a more robust discussion on this, my favorite book on the topic is \"A Philosophy of Software Design\" by John Ousterhout.

You may or may not have good ideas of what that entails.\n\nIn general, it helps to have a college degree in CS or software engineering to be a software engineer. The credentials of getting a degree show, to an extent, that you have accomplished something challenging. Whether you're any good at the end is debatable. Some turn out great. Some can't recall much of what they learn. Even so, the paper (degree) is worth a lot.\n\nBut it costs money, takes time, and can be challenging, especially if you already have a career.\n\nSome go to bootcamps, but you need to do some research. They turn to go too fast for some and they are expensive, but not as much as colleges. These typically last 3-6 months and is basically full-time (like a 9-5 experience).\n\nYou can get a Master's degree in software engineering if you have an undergrad degree in something. Some masters degrees don't require any prior programming knowledge (some require a CS or equivalent degree, so you need to do research).\n\nAlso, you could try asking /r/cscareerquestions or perhaps some reddit closer to your experience.",

Computer science is great for some many reasons, but it would probably be massive overkill in this case.  Years of school work and lots of debt.  Don't do it.  Find a python beginner course and learn the basics of python.  Then start writing scripts for whatever you need.",

There's no reason for OOP other than to make it easier for humans to work with code.\n\nIn my opinion, the most useful purpose of OOP is to let you establish rules, so that somebody working with your code can't accidentally use it wrong.\n\nThat's why it's so popular at large companies. Someone can design a class and give it a very simple public interface. They can then trust that junior engineers can safely call the public interface and it will work correctly.\n\nSimilarly, it can enable someone to extend an existing well-written class and customize its behavior while ensuring the core functionality still works.\n\nWithout OOP, it'd be much easier for lots of people all working on the same project to do something wrong or break something.\n\nSometimes the goal is to enforce rules for yourself! Even if you're the only one working on a program, OOP provides a way to organize it and help keep you from accidentally using your own code the wrong way.",

Like, people are still arguing over what this term means to this day, and they refuse to agree on a concrete definition.\n\nTypically though, OOP is, unsurprisingly centered around the idea of \"objects\"; encapsulated bundles of data, and methods that can interact with a given instance of said data. Under an OOP framework, a program is simply various interactions between different component objects.\n\nIn a Tamagotchi, you have a 'pet', that gets fed 'food' that you buy from the 'store', and keep in your 'inventory' until needed. The 'pet' can have different 'states' that effect its behaviour - states like \"hungry\", \"happy\" or \"dead\". All of these are displayed to the user of the game by a 'game window', and specific information can be managed by a 'settings manager'. You get the gist.\n\nMany people argue that OOP has proverbial 'pillars'; \"encapsulation\" (keeping related fields and methods bundled together in classes), \"inheritance\" (objects can inherit behaviour of other objects), and \"polymorphism\" (use an interface, dummy), but that's another question, and whether some of them matter enough is again, in contention.",

An example of this would be creating an instance of a class called HTTPServer and using it will cause it to start an http server without exposing you to the underlying sockets or network protocols to make it work - you don’t need to know all of the variables used by HTTPServer.",

Sign up for courses that both teach you something fundamental and make you implement things. Operating systems is a perfect example. You will learn a lot about how computers work from a low level and it will include writing and reading code. Other examples could be networks, distributed systems, embedded systems, or computer graphics. Basically any class where your homework is largely writing code. Many classes could fall into this category or not depending on how they're taught. For example, some compilers courses will have you write a compiler and others will just teach the theory and test you in it. Check the course before signing up to make sure it is not too theory heavy.\n\nThis is how you learn programming fundamentals, by learning how other people solved hard problems and then reimplementing the solutions yourself. For example, instead of learning about software design in an abstract sense, just learn about operating systems. You'll learn all the OOP principles. Separation of concerns, modularization, polymorphism. And what's even cooler is you'll learn it all in a language that isn't even OOP and then you will have an aha moment when you realize OOP is not the foundation.\n\nIf you have extra time to study, spend it doing the optional challenge exercises or questions on your homeworks/labs or join a team building a project. If you are stuck, go to office hours and ask for help. Take advantage of the resources and expertise available to you. Professors have connections in industry, if you stand out they can help you or they might even employ you directly",

This leads most (nearly all) new programmers to learn a wrong lesson: That learning programming languages is hard. It's realy not. Once you know a few, picking up another is a matter of a weekend and a few hours reading the docs. \n\nC#, Java and C++ share most of their concepts. They might have slightly different keywords and implementations, but that's just the surface layer. Once you know one of them really well (I mean really well, like understanding and being able to explain WHY thing are the way they are, and how they work under the hood) you can really write in all 3. \n\nFor Backend developent, you can basically choose what you want. C# and Java are better than C++ (in this specific case), many people also like Python or JS, Ruby, Go, PHP or rust. I could proably list 10 more languages if I took the time. \n\nI for one wrote backends in Python, JS, C# and rust and personally, the only language I didn't like out of those 4, was JavaScript. \n\nAnd, a last short point: Look at your local job market. Where I live (when I looked last), C# and Python were more popular than Java for Backend Dev specifically for example, but Java is also used for Android Dev and some Desktop UIs.

Most of the tutorials you find online are articles on blogs or YouTube videos, and they tend to cover some specific topic. In order to get the big picture that you need when you're learning a new language or large framework, you'd need to read/watch dozens of those types of tutorials, often from multiple authors, and try to synthesize general knowledge from that hodgepodge of specifics. I'd avoid any book with the word \"cookbook\" in the title for the same reason.\n\nWhat you want when you're learning a big topic is a big, comprehensive source that was built to teach that larger topic from soup to nuts, so you take a well-planned path through all the material you need and get a single, coherent perspective. To me, that mostly means getting a good book and working your way through it, but courses like the ones offered online by Stanford, Harvard, etc. would also work well.",

In practice, the compiler will enter `main` and move the stack pointer some offset; this space behind the stack pointer will go back to the end of the stack frame - the stack frame contains the information of where to go when `main` returns. This is the space allocated for the local variables. For you, that'd be about 4 bytes on a typical dev machine. So when `value_giver` returns, the memory for the return value is already allocated, and the compiler will generate machine instructions to write it into this stack space.\n\nIf you're curious, you could pick up a book on writing compilers, and function call conventions, virtual registers, register allocation via graph coloring, caching and swapping, virtual address spaces, and all sorts of fun theory put into practice.\n\nTypically compilers will generate machine code that all the local variables are allocated all at once, so this code:\n\n    void fn() {\n      int x;\n\n      // Stuff...\n\n      int y;\n\n      // Stuff...\n\nThe stack memory will look like:\n\n    [fn frame][x][y][stack pointer]\n\nSo even though `y` comes into scope later in the function code, all locals were allocated at once; it's just less work to do it this way, and the memory for `y` is inaccessible until the machine code that uses it comes into scope. Compilers don't have to do it this way, and the C standard says effectively nothing about machine code generation. C is a high level language that targets an abstract machine. The compiler projects that abstraction to the actual machine.\n\nAs far as C is concerned, `a = 25` because that's the code you wrote. How it's realized depends on the compiler and the target architecture that is going to execute those instructions.\n\nTo blow your mind - Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine - a purely mechanical clockwork digital computer. He never did get the funding to build it; some private investor spent millions of dollars and commissioned his earlier Difference Engine to be built, and it was completed and put on display in a London Museum for 2 years, before being brought into his private collection. All the Difference Engine does is compute logarithms.\n\nBut the Analytical Engine was digitized and simulated - and it fucking worked. Earlier analysis of the design has shown IT IS Turing Complete, and it was indeed designed to be a general purpose computer. So being Turing Complete means it is exactly equivalent to your computer you're using right now - just mechanical and slower. This means YOU CAN write a C compiler for the Analytical Engine and compile this program for it, and it would run. The gears would whirl and turn, and move in lockstep, and the output would be as you expect.",

In reality this is optimised, but in a very simple stack based system you just return the execution to where the function was called and then the assignment copies the value on the stack. The return type defines the width (how many bits/bytes) are on the stack. After that the next function call will write to the stack, overwriting that value.\n\nThe stack, CPU registers, and pointers that control program execution and function calls make it all work. \n\nThere's a pointer that tells the CPU which instruction to execute next. That's the \"Instruction Pointer\" (IP). It can \"jump\" to where a function and and then \"jump\" back when the function returns. The pointers can just be on the stack because stacking those addresses makes it easy.  \n  \nSince it uses a stack\\*, it must know where on the stack the function has to work with local variables.

It sadly happens, but not too often. \n\nThe thing that does put me off quite often is when I get resumes from new graduates who decide to rate themselves out of 5 for each of their skills and put 5/5 for most of them. That's funny to me. I've been writing Java code professionally since 1999 and if I was feeling particularly confident I \\*might\\* give myself a 4. There are certainly people better than I am. \n\nDon't do that. The interviewer, if they know what is good for them, and also good for you, will be thinking not, \"can this person already do the job?\", but rather, \"is this somebody I think I could train?\". This means trying to be as solid as you can in the basics, admit the stuff you don't know, and ask them questions that make it clear that you understand that they know more than you, and you are interested in learning from them. If they are the kind of place that will expect somebody in your position to already be an experienced professional developer, they wont hire you.... and you will have dodged a bullet.",

You need to understand how to build your own project, so by watching beginning videos, you can see how arrays, loops, and functions come together.  As you go along, think of ideas for your own projects, like maybe build a calculator with HTML/CSS, then work the functionality, and with a calculator, you can make it more complex as you learn more.  Figure out how to make things functional.  I mean, you can build a webpage that looks like a blog with HTML and CSS, but how do you get comments to post for everyone to see, then allow replies?  Do you know how to do that?  That could be a project, to give things action, to make them work.  Add functionality.\n\nFurthermore, I would look into intermediate courses.   O'Reilly has a couple intermediate python courses and one of them has a live instructor.  I've been thinking of signing up for that, but haven't looked into costs.  I used to be a member and it was like 600/yr.  I just don't know if you can take 1 class for free or if you have to pay for a month or a few months.... but it may be worth looking into for you.\n\nI saw you're interning, can I ask where?

Consequently money was flowing in an unnaturally free and cheap way across the economy since.\n\nSince then, interest rates have gone up, money has become tighter and more scarce, and the \"party\" is coming to an end so to speak.\n\nWhen money is tighter, consumers spend less, businesses hire less, people invest less, people are more risk averse, etc. The economy as a whole starts to slow down.\n\nSo startups that were once being flooded with money by investors throwing everything they could at anything resembling \"tech\" suddenly see their investments dry up. Mid-sized businesses can't get loans. Companies aren't willing to spend as much money on advertisements, so sites like google, instagram, Facebook, etc. see their revenue go down. Consumers buy less products on Amazon.\n\nSo everyone stops hiring, and then they start doing layoffs, which means people have even less money to spend on stuff, and the cycle continues to plummet downward into a recession.\n\nAnd that is what we're going through now.\n\nAre there some jobs being made obsolete by AI? Yeah, probably. But that is a secondary factor. The \"crash\" following the \"high\" of reckless monetary policy is the primary reason the economy is crashing now, in tech as much as everywhere else.\n\nHope that helps you.",

You can *read about* concepts, but eventually you should start writing code. I recommend finding a book or online course and sticking to it. The constant switching between tutorials is called *tutorial hell*, where you reread about the same basic concepts but never actually do anything. It's a common trap for beginners.",

Python does have more going on under the hood, and can feel more \"abstracted\" away from the hardware, while C does not hide many things from you.\n\nBaby steps... \"toy\" programs are good for learning syntax. Get a logo bouncing on the screen, or make a button change the background color to a random color.  If you are using HTML and CSS with your JavaScript then this should be approachable to a beginner. \n\nYou don't have to design the Sistine Chapel from scratch.

Use feature flags (LaunchDarkly or Unleash) to hide unfinished modules so you can merge to main safely. For shared code, keep packages private and link via workspaces; add Changesets to version only when you actually need a publish, otherwise just bump internal packages and let turbo’s cache handle rebuilds. If you truly need hard isolation but one domain, use Next.js multi‑zone or Azure Front Door path routing so /community, /registration, etc. point at separate app artifacts.\n\nFor APIs across apps, I’ve paired LaunchDarkly and Azure Front Door with DreamFactory to auto-generate secure endpoints over shared databases without writing boilerplate.\n\nTL;DR: monorepo + per‑app pipelines + feature flags; multi‑zone if you need stricter deploy isolation.",

It took me the introductory course (with an extra course I took, because I was struggling) and a practical course with a group project in my 2. semester. After that course, I felt like I can built stuff that's really helpful for me. And that's what I did. Been programming for 13 years now. \n\nIt's definitely not about being smart. Programming is really one of the easier concepts in a CS curriculum. And Python is especially easy. I was taught Java at first (which I'm glad about). But I think you also need to either be wired to think like a programmer or you need to learn it. You will learn to think more analytically and you will learn how to solve problems. Or you will find out that that kind of thinking is just not for you.\n\nMy advice is: Just stick with it. If you can find any joy or interest in programming, then stick with it. It will click some day. If the whole experience is just a drag to you, even after trying for months, that might mean that it's not for you. Also: Don't do it for the money. If you don't enjoy it, you'll be miserable.\n\nBTW: I barely passed my introductory programming course. But once I finished the practical course in the second semester, I was an A-B student when I came to practical programming courses. They were always interesting and I always got some sort of satisfaction out of it learning new things and solving problems. Most of the time, I was the one pulling the group. So, don't worry if it's hard at first. Because it is. It might click some day, but it takes a lot of practice! You have to sit down and write code. A LOT! Don't skip any homework. Write and practice as much code as possible.\n\nBut I also have to ask: What kind of CS MASTERS needs to give an intro to PYTHON? That's nuts! How did you even get into the masters without a CS bachelor?",

        "body": "If it makes you feel better, this is a field where you constantly feel like you're not smart enough for it. \n\n\nYou basically get comfortable at feeling dumb, feeling lost, and failing repeatedly. Learn to allow yourself to experience these things without negativity or devaluing your self-worth. Being comfortable with that opens up your mind for everything else. That way, you won't feel discouraged for doing extra research or taking longer than others to figure things out...or you could just ignore that and stress out 24/7 😏\n\n\nWith that said, a lot of programmers are obsessed with the idea that learning it must be really difficult; if you can't do x thing in y way, then \"you're not cut out for it.\"\n\n\nI find *that* ridiculous, just like I find the method to teach you for loops a little odd. \n\n\nDon't be afraid to take a few steps back and look up introductory courses to x concept and asking for a lot of guidance if you're stuck on something. \n\n\nIf you wind up going further down this path, remember this - building usable programs is really important, even if they're very basic to start.\n\n\nMy curriculum failed to even suggest that. We've never even built a basic calculator like you are now. This led to my growth in programming being at a near plateau for 2 years. \n\n\nI learned theory, syntax, and basic concepts but never actually trained the most important aspect of a programmer - solving problems. A programmer is a problem-solver who uses tools (languages, functions, etc) to solve them. \n\n\nThat's why many people emphasize solving the problem with writing out diagrams, pictures, words, etc, then turning that into psuedocode you can easily follow. \n\n\nHere's a simple way breaking the problem down would look like:\n- If I receive 2 numbers, let's say 6 and 2, what would the end result be? 12? \n- How would I get from my base numbers to get to 12 while only adding? Adding by 2, 6 times?\n- How do I make my program loop by 6 times?\n- How do I make sure I correctly add 2 each time in that loop? \n- How do I see if my end result is 12?\n- How do I replace my numbers 6 and 2 with variables? \n- Would I get the same result assigning 6 and 2 to those variables before the loop?\n- How do I get user input to achieve the same result?\n\n\nSo on and so forth. Maybe add some psuedocode to give a basic idea of how it would flow in code. \n\n\nBuilding a bigger program would follow a similar process. Whenever you break down a problem but get stuck on breaking it down further for x, y, z reasons, that might be a good indicator of searching up a little more about x, y, and z.\n\n\nHope that helps! I'm a fellow beginner, so you might even be building something I find difficult right now lmao. ",

If you’re curious about how computers actually work under the hood, memory, CPU, OS, hardware interactions, then absolutely go for it. It gives you a strong foundation that makes you a better developer overall. Languages like C, C++, or Rust teach you to think about efficiency, optimization, and resource management in ways high-level languages hide.\n\nThat said, it’s not always beginner-friendly. Debugging and memory management can be frustrating at first. If your goal is app or web dev, you might not need to dive deep right away. But if you’re into systems, embedded, cybersecurity, or game engines, learning low-level programming is 100% worth it. It’s harder, but it pays off in skill and understanding.",

Find a beginner friendly book or course about basic consepts of programming and go through it. Know what? If you are aiming to master C++, your initial learning doesn’t even need to be in C++. Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, didn’t start out with C++, of course. He also says in interviews that every programmer would benefit from learning a handful of languages. Find some pods with Bjarne Stroustrup!\n\nMister C++ himself perhaps wouldn’t agree with this, but much of the best books on programming basics use Lisps as a vehicle. This way, they can focus on the programming itself, rather than forcing complex syntax on the reader.\n\nOne good example is “The Little Schemer” by Friedman & Felleisen. If you choose that one, I’ll spoil one thing: The “rules” and ”commandments” presented in the book are just rules within the book, meant to be applied when solving the exercises; they are generally not rules of the Scheme lang. This could be a bit confusing, if you haven’t understood it. Another thing: if you don’t solve a problem now, you maybe solve it next time. This is a simple, little book, that kind of escalates sneakily. You can read it over and over again till you get everything.",

Kevlin Henney is another great lecturer to check out when it comes to code semantics and programming linguistics which can also lend a hand in your learning style.\n\nI would recommend beginning with compilers that you invoke via the CLI (g++ or clang, so maybe start on Linux or a Mac) instead of an IDE that compiles everything for you (such as Visual Studio or Code::Blocks.) This way you can learn how build systems work under the hood and get into makefiles and also expose yourself to valgrind (this is essential if you want to learn and do your due diligence in the craft.)\n\nAlso, it would be helpful to learn some C if you haven't already. I recommend c99 for simplicity unless you want to see what threading is all about, then go with c11 or newer. Furthermore, have a very in-depth understanding of how compiled languages differ from interpreted languages (static vs. dynamic languages, respectively)\n\nI could go at length, and for some context, I typically point to prerequisites before the actual topic one wants to study. The foundations are too important to ignore, imo",

Flask lets you make a simple website to view and edit data, and SQLite can store everything in a single file. You will need a backup plan for the database, but it's simple and doesn't require a server.\n\nIf multiple people need access at the same time, you will need a server and a proper database. Node.js lets you run JavaScript on the server to handle multiple users. A NoSQL database like MongoDB is easier than SQL for beginners because you don't have to plan tables and relationships in advance. You can just add new fields as you go (Useful if they later need to add random stuff they forgot to mention). An online database just means the database lives on a server everyone can access, but it requires hosting, security, and backups. There are generous free tiers but it adds complexity.\n\nFor now, start small with Flask and SQLite on your own computer as a demo. Focus on the key features, tracking animals, medications, and volunteer logs. Once it works, you can think about scaling it with Node.js and MongoDB if more people need access or using something like Pymongo to keep using your Flask app instead of redoing it in Node.js.\n\nWhat you are building is a basic CRUD app with a form to add new animals and a table to view them. It's simple enough that an AI could probably build it for you. If you want to learn, use AI as a tutor or guide so you don't get lost. Keep it simple. Adding too many features will make it take longer to finish and harder to maintain later.",

A country suffices. \n\nFrom a central EU and USA perspective: \n\nA degree is not 100% necessary, but makes the entire process of finding and keeping (good) jobs a lot easier. If you want to go this route, taking all general STEM classes you can get before will help. \n\nA computer science degree will generally give you good basics, but you will be expected to \"self learn\" programming along the way. You will probably get taught the basics for programming as well, but everything beyond that is incidental. Programming is to computer science as masonry to an architect. This is the slowest route, but you will be the most well rounded, and able to go into basically any field (inside of IT) you want to specialize in. \n\nA software engineering degree locks you out of very few things: Theoretical CS research is the only thing that comes to mind, but I am sure there is a little more. It mostly has the same basics as a general computer science degree, but you specialize in how software works, is made and programming a lot more. Theoretical CS and other possible specializations, like Bio/medicine and programming, physics or IT-security will be ignored more. If you know that you want to be a programmer, this is always solid. \n\nIn some countries you also have vocational training as a programmer, you can treat this like a Software Engineering degree, but shorter and with less prestige. \n\nThen you can go the self taught route. Here it's even more about a good portfolio, to prove oyu are able to work, and good networking. You need connections to get anywhere, because you need to give people a reason to even consider you an option. Normally the degree does that for you (to an extend, networking is also important if you have one) \n\nCertificates are motly completely useless in my experience. This will vary greatly throughout different regions and specific fields, but when we did technical evaluations of new candidates, we just ignored any certificates. The only thing we looked at was education and prior experience, like a portfolio or earlier jobs they've had. I know now, that in some countries they hold quite a bit more value, and that's why it's important to say where (approximately) you will be looking for work, once your education is done. \n\nIf you want to know where to start for self learning, there is a quite well written FAQ section in this subreddit (right hand side of your screen on PC, you will find it on mobile as well) with a list of places to start, very well laid out and explained",

One of the best ways to keep motivation in my opinion is building something that solves a problem you have, because the drive to solve a problem is what makes programming so insanely addictive and fun. Solving a problem you have is the most rewarding and motivational thing I've ever experienced programming. So, try it out, don't wait for motivation just think of something that annoys you and build a solution. For example, I didn't like having to go to so many different sites to compress and convert different file formats so I made my own website that converts and compresses audios, videos and images in one simple place and that is one of my favorite projects because it really showed me that motivation doesn't come from waiting around or watching courses, but from solving problems, coming up with something to make and making it.\n\nStay consistent by practicing and by making mistakes, keep yourself in that loop of frustrated about why your code isn't running but then you figure it out and you're really happy, that loop of dopamine will make learning fun and addictive for you. And when learning and problem solving becomes addictive that's when you start building the software you dream of building, because you start to realize that nothing is too difficult you just have to put in more work.",

A template engine can allow one HTML fragment to include others, and it can also allow more dynamic substitutions. Many beginners use Python along with the lightweight Flask web framework, which uses the Jinja template engine.\n\nIf you're dedicated to using Java, you can use servlets and JSP pages (kind of old school) or you can go with a more modern framework like Spring, which supports a variety of template engines.\n\nIf you want to use client-side rendering with JavaScript, you once again have lots of options: React, Angular, Svelte, Vue, ...",

They often enjoy getting to explain their reasoning and the merits of their decisions, if they're doing so to someone who is genuinely curious and interested.",

Every single failure teaches you something. It teaches you how not to do things, which is equally important to knowing how to do things.

Text file? CSV? JSON? Excel? - depending on that, you need different tools - research them.\n\nThe whole thing starts by formulating your requirements. The more detailed you formulate them, the better.\n\nThen, break the large idea down into small units - open the file, read a line - process a line - write the output - repeat until there are no more lines\n\nThat's way too coarse - further breakdown is necessary - open and read are okay(ish) - processing needs much deeper drilling into - since you haven't told what you need to do with the data and in what format the original data is, this is up to you to figure out - last writing to file is also okay(ish).\n\nGo deeper and deeper - break things down, rinse and repeat.\n\nOnly if you do that, you will get a deep understanding of what you even want/have to do.\n\nThen, start working on implementing your parts - one after the other.\n\n---\n\nGood luck!",

Could this be the solution to what I'm trying to do?\n\nIt could be sufficient for your purposes, but more of an alternative to using React. Likely the technique you're looking for is what we call templating. It's also what SSGs use.\n\nI'm not personally familiar with react so I can't give an exact answer for your situation, but one common type of templating is [jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), where you can have a template like `hello {{name}}` (which you should be familiar with from basic string interpolation), and logic like `{% for name in names %}hello {{name}}{% endfor %}`.\n\nStatic site generators essentially use templates to produce static HTML that you can serve to people through stuff like github pager, a simple Apache webserver, etc. Usually it involves some setup in terms of theming and what you want headers, footers, etc to be, and then you can do stuff like add blog posts written in Markdown with minimal effort.\n\nYou can find static site generators in pretty much any language. Some commonly used ones include\n\n* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (Ruby)\n* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Go)\n* [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) (Rust, but more special-purpose)\n\nSome of the ones I've used include\n\n* [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) (node.js)\n* [hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) (Haskell)\n\nYou can find [a list of SSGs on jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/). There's 370 of them currently, some general-purpose, some special-purpose. Given that you seem to have some experience with node.js you could have a look at 11ty to see if it seems to cover your needs.",

Store event data in a DB/CMS with fields like title, date, backgroundColor, theme, and a blocks array (e.g., hero, speakers, schedule). Your EventPage maps blocks to components, so “unique flair” is just data. For SEO, compute meta tags from the fetched event. Prefetch the event on card hover or intersection to keep it snappy.\n\n\n\nIf you want SSG, Next.js works well: pages/events/\\[slug\\] with getStaticPaths to build popular events, and revalidate to keep them fresh. You still drive layout from metadata, so special cases don’t break the system.\n\n\n\nFor backends, I’ve used Hasura for instant GraphQL on Postgres and Supabase for auth/storage; when I needed REST from an existing SQL DB without writing controllers, DreamFactory auto-generated endpoints and docs.\n\n\n\nBottom line: build a single data-driven EventPage under a dynamic route and let metadata handle variations.",

Whatever matches your interests. You'll always be learning\n- Build up your knowledge while building many projects utilizing Git. Push a few into production if applicable \n- Always be curious about what's going on under the hood and dive deep into books\n- Find the fun in what you're doing and learning \n\n\nThen, when you've built a lot of personal projects (without following step-by-step tutorials) and maybe pushed some into production:\n- Go for a masters in an adjacent field (CS, software engineering, etc) if you can\n- Apply to jobs and internships \n\n\nAvoid paid bootcamps if you can. I heard that the vast majority of recent bootcampers don't get placements, which follows the unemployment rates of CS majors.\n\n\nI believe all of the information within a bootcamp and CS degree are available online free.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you absolutely need a job within a few months and absolutely want this field, well, I recommend being wary of Reddit. It'll be filled with countless people who have way more experience than us who are struggling to find work. \n\n\nI'd recommend going through a list of fields (search up developer roadmap github for ideas of what they look like), then seeing which ones are hiring the most.\n\n\nAlso, try checking out github repos for remote work. \n\n\nOnce you find something that's hiring a lot, you can start doing your research on a process suitable for you.\n\n\nI'm assuming that the faster you want a job, the more effort you'll have to put into networking, applying, and finding unorthodox methods to get in. Some people even resort to cheating to get placements.\n\n\n.\n\n\nLook into IT roles as well to see if they're hiring. You may have to get a certification (like the comptia ones) or get a helpdesk or desktop support role and move up from there with more experience and certs. \n\n\n.\n\n\nIf you find something, put me on too! ",

This is a static table of function pointers - each abstract class and derived class has it's own table. Your instance points to its table.\n\nSo then, if you have a `B` instance, but through type erasure you only have an `A` pointer, then calling a method will undergo a lookup so the correct implementation is called.\n\nMaybe.\n\nThe vtable only contains entries for `virtual` methods. In your example, the only entry in the vtable of both `A` and `B` will be for `print`. You didn't make `~A` virtual, so when you `delete a`, the compiler doesn't know `a` is pointing to a `B`. The compiler only knows the non-virtual interface presented to it through the `A` type.\n\n---\n\nIf you google OOP in C, you can find tutorials for building objects in C, including modeling inheritance, and polymorphism. The object code generated by this exercise typically matches the C++ equivalent exactly. The first C++ compiler - CFront, was originally a transpiler to C.\n\nSo why not just use C? Because the two languages have different type systems. C++ grants you much more type safety - and type safety is more than just catching errors; compilers are theorem provers, and they use type information in order to optimize more aggressively. C and C++ are both high level abstract languages, they're not high level assembly languages. It's not about what machine code they generate.",

It’s very frustrating to be at work doing repetitive, mindless stuff, without the ability to physically type at all lol. That’s life of course. I suppose I need to regroup and look into a more realistic plan of action. \n\nAs for u/abrahamguo thank you for a potential solution. I may give it a shot before giving up on the audio-only listening. It’s a cool idea.",

Why are you even studying computer sciences?\n\nPerhaps try to (re)define your goals and decide based on that if you should keep going or if you should give up.\n\nYou were born too late to deal with programming? So, the progress has stopped and no updates, no new libraries, no new technologies will come any more? Who do you think is making all these updates to your apps, improving the AI that you are so much worried about, creating new systems and maintaining the existing ones? How come exactly you were born too late?\n\nIn terms of something being useless or not, have you tried to assess the current market, if it is being used or if it is useless? It takes exactly few seconds to write \"DSA use in 2025\" or \"Python jobs in 2025\". You are not proving/disproving these worries and claims and remaining in your own darkness.\n\nIn terms of competitive programming, it is not as important. Better care about hackathons. And for both, what will realistically happen when you start doing these NOW? Right now when you start doing competitive programming, what will happen? You'll be last in the rankings? But will you gain absolutely nothing from it? No new experience, no new knowledge, no new skills? What will happen when you join the next upcoming hackathon? Realistically, what will happen? You won't get anything done? You'll place last? Your stuff does not work? Your stuff will be basic? But even that will be a position to gain new information from. You'll learn where are you and you'll learn what else you can improve in yourself. And at best, you get something done and do not land last in the ranking.\n\nAnd about memorizing stuff then computer sciences is not just about memorizing stuff but about that information into a practice. You sit in lectures -> try to do something practical after that and use that new knowledge. You learn a new technology -> start using that new technology. It is all about practicing what you are learning.\n\nYou are worried about the AI. Who stops you from hopping on the AI train? Learn to use it (not learn to rely on it blindly). Free AI tools are there. It takes just few Youtube videos to see how to use one or another tool. You can allocate one weekend on learning to use an AI and already you'll know more and you'll be more experienced than prior to that weekend.\n\nHopelessness will not change anything. Start taking real actions. Stop worrying about \"what if\"-s. Either you do things or you do not.",

        "body": "Write an HTTP server.\n\nHTTP is a text based protocol, and you can get away with just implementing GET and POST - and you don't even need the whole thing - you can just ignore authentication, for example. You generate an HTTP response IN TEXT. It's all text. That's the point of this exercise.\n\nSeriously, don't overthink it - it's not hard. You're not writing a complete web server, you just need to read text from a stream, figure out what message type you got, and service it.\n\nYou can write main in terms of `std::cin` and `std::cout`. What makes standard IO so special is that you can use the `netcat` command to open a listening socket on port 8080, and launch an instance of your program - `netcat` will establish the TCP stream for you, and redirect all IO to your program's standard IO. So here you're coding against `std::cin` and `std::cout`, and in reality, it's coming from a TCP socket over a pipe across the network.\n\nNow you can just hit the localhost loopback device with a web browser on port 8080, and your program just reads `std::cin` to process the GET request, and you write back a payload with the most barebones HTML that says \"Hello World!\" in it. Or maybe some JSON, or XML, since both those are transport protocols - you can just write it raw, you don't need a template engine that processes JSON or anything like that.\n\nBut you could... If you get ambitious...\n\nYou can also use `telnet` or `curl` to interact with your little server and see a more raw view, or the developer tools built into the browser - whatever those do...\n\nAs for your code, OOP is message passing to objects, so you can implement a couple message types:\n\n    class GET {};\n    class POST {};\n\n    using request = std::variant<GET, POST>;\n\n    std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, request &);\n\nThe stream operator will start to parse out the HTTP request, determine the request type, and then create the corresponding variant type. This makes this stream operator here a factory method. Once you get as far as knowing the message type, you could defer to the message type instance to populate itself from the stream:\n\n    class GET {\n      friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, GET &);\n    };\n    class POST {\n      friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, POST &);\n    };\n\nYou'll probably want a response message:\n\n    class response {\n      friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &, const response &);\n    };\n\nTo make an object, you make it streamable:\n\n    class http_server: public std::streambuf {};\n\nIf you want to parse text, you overload a couple things:\n\n    class http_server: public std::streambuf {\n      int_type underflow() override, overflow(int_type) override;\n    };\n\nAnd you can plug that into a stream:\n\n    http_server svr;\n    std::iostream ios{&svr};\n\nYou can make a number of these, for being different kinds of processors and handlers and stages that all perform steps. Messages move content, objects do work. This is OOP in C++. This is why Bjarne invented C++, because he wanted more control over message passing, and he wanted greater type safety than either Smalltalk or C. Streams are the interface - and frankly you can bypass the stream implementations almost completely if you're messaging internally in your application - you don't have to serialize to text all the damn time. There's a lot you can do with OOP if you think in terms of objects and messages.\n\nI demonstrate these principles in past posts of mine, I spend most of my Reddit time answering C++ questions on Reddit, so look up a couple of my past examples.\n\nBut if you can implement objects and message passing as OOP intended, I think you'll show your professor something he's almost certainly never seen in his life. MOST people can't even tell you what OOP IS, because they've never seen it themselves, before. Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism? These principles are NOT OOP, they just come OUT of OOP. These principles exist in other paradigms, too. You've got polymorphism in everything from imperative programming to functional programming, for example. Most C++ code is C with Classes because people don't know what they're doing - garbage in, garbage out. I've spoken to other developers who understand OOP, but in 30 years I've never actually met one in real life, never worked with one. I've worked with a Windows 95/DirectX/COM co-author, I've worked with the former maintainer of the Intel Fortran compiler (and that's a big fucking deal, since it's used on all the worlds supercomputers), and I've shown them this stuff, how Bjarne writes code, and they've never seen anything like it before.",

A 90 minute take home, a virtual technical, and a virtual behavioral. Only their final rounds are in-person.\n\nThat said, I definitely expected this. Just like companies work arrangements are mostly going back to how they were pre-covid with hybrid being the most common, followed by 100% onsite, followed by remote being the most rare. Interviews are the same way. In-person worked. Not only is it a way to prevent cheating, but it's significantly easier to read body language, and to get a better vibe of a person (in *both* directions, this benefits the candidate to judge the interviewers) when you're in-person.\n\nIt's also not that expensive for the company. The final round can be expensive-ish to fly people in, like Google's doing here. But pre-covid something that was common before the final rounds was to have candidates early in the process drive out to a proctored test site to do their \"interview\" there. There's thousands upon thousands of test centers *globally*, you just drive out ot one near you. I've done it before, it was pretty easy. Local proctored testing is very cheap.\n\nI think this was inevitable. The rise of AI just sped things along a bit.\n\nAnd to those who haven't done in-person interviews before, it's ***way*** easier to whiteboard out a problem in pseudocode and another person in the room, versus doing it in a real IDE via typing where all your syntax needs to be right with people staring at you on camera.",

There’s a huge gap between the skills companies actually need and the number of people already trained and looking for work. So you end up with fewer openings and way too many applicants, and let’s not even talk about how low the salaries companies are offering these days. It’s not just tech either, people are getting degrees in fields like anthropology or psychology, and unless they go all the way to a PhD, they’re stuck in an endless loop of not having enough experience. The good thing is your degree is still super relevant to today’s needs.\n\nI think you should get your resume in front of as many people as possible. Find companies in your area where you’d actually like to work and reach out to people in the departments you’re interested in. Tell them your situation, ask if they know of any openings, and see if they’re willing to help or give some guidance. It’s not a guaranteed solution, but it really does increase your chances. If you’re open to remote work, check out [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/); it shares a simple but effective way to send your resume to hundreds of companies.\n\nAnd don’t forget, all the jobs you’ve done to get by still matter. Every bit of work experience teaches discipline, problem-solving, and perseverance. Those things count more than you think.

Ridiculous.

That said, I've had professors with perfect English who were bad enough that I thought it was impacting my grade. I got in the habit each semester of researching the professors of classes I wanted to take, checking out ratemyprofessor, and yes, profiling them to an extent. It's not worth it to suffer through a semester where you're not learning anything.\n\n\nThe good news is that there's no end of supplemental resources you can find for whatever topic you're studying. If you can't understand your professor, it's definitely an unfortunate waste of time to be in lecture, but as long as you know what skills you're supposed to be developing you can get there on your own.\n\n\nAlso, some of those professors are better in office hours. I can zone out to the lecture of someone who's hard to understand, but if it's 1:1, they have to go at your pace, so you can have them repeat or rephrase until you're satisfied.",

Electrical and comp hardware looks pretty competitive too given limited postings. I don't see any clear underfilled jobs. Plus a lot of jobs out there are requiring multiple years of exp .",

So, in all, not that bad, but very frustrating and time consuming. Back then Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft had all just laid off 10K employees that week each, so it was impossible for anyone to get a new FAANG offer.\n\nIt’s difficult, but keep trying and work hard - I have faith good things will come :)",

All jobs were \"desirable\" jobs and companies. Sorry for being a bit vague, I keep the personal details vague on reddit.\n\nI learned two lessons from the search. First of all, make sure to keep in touch with your network, especially the people you did great work with in the past. Not all stretches of your career will have you working with people you click with and on projects that succeed, but the stretches that do are where your real network comes from.\n\nSecond, make sure to study system design interviews. They've become performance theater at this point like LeetCode and you're expected to \"know the moves\" at some places. Most staff+ interviews also had a project presentation and Q&A part which paradoxically is the opposite where you're cooked if you never had the scope and scars but you don't need to study for. Also expect newer companies to ask more non-memorizable-from-internet coding and system design questions, which IMO is a great thing because that'll probably trickle to the rest of the industry eventually.\n\nThe above is for ICs who are still hands on. The market seems to be rough for pure engineering management roles unless your previous team was a strong match for the role.",

They, again, just don't want to.\n\nSo let me spin your own question back at you. Why do so many engineers and scientists in the east pivot *out* of their technical career track and go into political/management roles where they stop doing the work they supposedly loved doing?\n\nThat's very strange to me as someone in the West.

I learned a whole, whole lot, though mostly on my own in terms of technical stuff, but a lot on the business side from being in such a small and early company.\n\n\nIt's not for everyone, but contrary to most other comments, I see it as a great opportunity because instead of sitting down and trying to figure out a project to work on to practice, learn, and solve problems, which is hard, you actually have that part taken care of. You're also basically on the weeds immediately of figuring out things like cross-functional communication and collaboration, prioritization of value generation vs maintainability based on expected impact and necessity, autonomy and ownership etc...\n\n\nHence, why its the \"senior junior\" situation. You speed run learning some senior skills while potentially missing out on some of the more mid-level things like adhering to team styling, some knowledge gaps that come from needing to ship and not having the time or team for learning more about developing in a mature project, learning about choosing when to apply design patterns etc...\n\n\nThose things tend to come about from a bit slower of a pace where engineers can be deeper on engineering rather than making sure market fit has been established, runway is secured, and good enough is more important than scaling and maintaining due to the rapid nature of changing demands.\n\n\nBut, as I said, that isn't for everyone which is okay. It also qualifies you much more towards startups/early/growth since the dynamics and environment, as well as associated skills and knowledge, aren't the same as more matured process and product. So it can be a little harder when trying to transition to something else, but I think its excellent experience to have.\n\n\nI feel like it may be easier to go from startup to mid+ than the other way around. Just my thoughts.",

What I would do in that situation instead of waiting is, reach out to that team you are waiting on, ask if they can at least agree on the structure of the JSON. Then vibe code a fake API so you can build out your front end. \n\nBasically find any way you can to move forward without “waiting”. Even if you have to make changes later, you will be better off and look more proactive.\n\nThat’s my advice",

The industry is cyclical, so going through busts suck and will happen more than once (layoffs, business decisions that go against engineering etc...)\n2. Interviewing is stressful, time consuming, and arduous (leetcode etc...)\n3. Not finding some level of interest and enjoyment in the field. This is a field that requires constant learning so if you want to be competitive you cannot stagnate. This is not a great profession to coast bc that will either lead to the learning feeling like a PITA or to you being in a lackluster position which will make future job hunts harder (see 1&2).\n\nPersonally I was most burnt out working boring jobs with outdated tech that did not have room to grow or stay competitive, even though they were fairly easy and chill.\n\nI felt the least burnt out working on interesting projects with modern tech and smart people, even though I was working 10-20 hours more a week than the chill jobs.",

That was not the norm in most careers.\n\nSecond, LOTS of passion in this industry. Or at least, there was. Any industry that attracts passionate people who love the idea of the work has problems with burnout.\n\nThird, it's a type of work that many people find they really put themselves deeply into. You have to defend your ideas, work as part of a team, take ownership. You are seen as an expert, a go to person. You have special knowledge no one else has. All of that further encourages people to go all in.\n\nFinally, for a long time the MONEY you could get at the top of the field was insane. But also random. Working harder and making yoru company succeed could be the difference between a nice middle class life and being a billionaire. No doctor is thinking they might be the next Bill Gates if they work just a LIIIITLE bit harder.\n\nHuge parts of the industry have no problem with burnout.

And I might have a days worth of tedious work that I know how to do mixed into all that but the rest takes active learning, stressing/sweating, asking around etc. and that’s exhausting. And frequently, it could be your fault or could be zero percent your fault, you do something wrong or have to go back and start a part all over and some MBA thinks you’re underperforming because someone at their old company with a totally different process and set of standards accomplished something remotely similar, maybe, in a little less time…\n\nI find even doctors, tradespeople, other engineers and frankly just about every other job has a LOT more autopilot work.

Owners want to maximize their own profit, so it is in the owner's best interest to pay the worker as little as possible, and to work the worker as long as possible. This is made worse by the fact that profit under capitalism actually tends to fall over time, since capitalism is quite good at making things more efficient it tends to overproduce things in the long run, devaluing the products it produces, meaning often the only way to squeeze out more profit is by squeezing the workers.\n\nThe workers in IT fields are well paid (still much less than the actual value they provide to the company), but work long hours, frequently more than full time, in order to meet arbitrary deadlines and push profits to an extreme. This work is highly mentally taxing contributing to burnout. Additionally globalization, outsourcing, and complacency due to high salaries makes demands for better working environments difficult.\n\nedit: To make things worse, since the 2010s tech companies have been relying on an extremely loan heavy monetary strategy due to low interest rates which actually requires profits to grow exponentially in order to pay their loans back, but this strategy is beginning to falter due to problems like \"running out of people on the planet to sell to\", and \"2% higher interest rates to combat hyper inflation caused by tech company speculative circle jerking\", and \"loans coming due\". Workers are getting squeezed even harder as such.\n\nAnyway some drunk stinky german guy figured out all of this in the 1800s in a long winded economic treatise on commodities.",

Making software, selling software/companies, tech contracts, selling your time/expertise etc, so many paths to bank. \n\nI'm convinced most of this sub is from the bottom of bottom community colleges with degrees not worth their paper or there is something else with them that isn't being honestly portrayed online. It's bad out there but compared to the rest of the economy, we are still coasting. Maybe it's time to get good? \n\nBeing a professional means being competitive. It's your name and honor on the line for your skills regarding computers and all their business. That's such a large area. How do you still find no opportunity there?!?",

Career advice, particular from junior/new/student peeps naturally comes in.\n\nI would actually encourage /r/cscareerquestions members to spend time in OTHER disciplines, reading, and trying to understand what others go through.

To quote a movie, \"We're not so different you and I.\"\n\n2) Junior new employee problems and concerns have even MORE overlap.\n\n3) Other discipline subreddits probably (my guess) have a HIGHER experience level overall that /r/cscareerquestions.  I am a FIRM believer that senior more experienced people just... do everything better... than junior people.  This isn't a mentality that I necessarily see prevalent in this community.

The company I worked for the longest time had three employees and does not exist anymore (this was *fun* to explain to Japanese immigration for my work visa), and the largest company I ever worked for had 8000 employees worldwide. I have never had a problem getting interviews.\n\n2. Not all recognizable brands are good. Accenture's reputation is that they select for conformity, not skill.\n\n3. AI will have a massive shift soon. Pretty much everyone noticed by now that there have been several trillion dollars invested into AI by now, so there will now have to be a few trillion dollars in revenue, soon, or investors will pull the plug. It won't be entirely dead, but completely different.\n\n4. Employment laws and expectations in Japan and Europe are different. My expectation is that when the bottom drops out from the current AI boom, Accenture will focus on retraining you, and you may end up doing something completely different, but you will still have a job, while a mid-sized company may lay off people more quickly, but on the upside, you then already have a visa.\n\nSo basically, if your plan is to leave Japan, and your main skillset is AI related, the \"leave now\" option is likely better. Amsterdam is also a good place to start, the next opportunity might be in Berlin, which is also a nice city but much more of a culture shock, and more depressing in winter.",

Maybe a few thousand if you compare it to eating out / doordashing. When you're already looking at $200k+ TC, a few thousand dollars in free food shouldn't even be a blip on your radar. That, and I prefer bringing my own meals in to the office, even when there's free food.

Significantly above everything else, including salary.\n\nSo on that alone, #1 isn't even an option for me.\n\nI'm not sure #2 sounds all that appealing to me either... cause I agree with you, being at a hybrid/onsite place as a new grad is really valuable.

I think in most cases management does not even know what \"quality code\" looks like and just relies on SWEs to do their job.  Now SWE \"talent\" comes in to play and most companies are not hiring big tech company level SWEs since they cannot compete with total compensation.\n\nI've worked on safety critical medical devices at private non-tech companies in non-tech cities, think dialysis machines, for my 15+ year career.   These companies have mature processes as they have been around for 30+ years. The devices we created were safe and had FDA approval, but the codebase was real spaghetti in many areas.\n\nMost of the time it came down to SWEs just working within the existing code base.  They don't really care about pushing for refactors unless it was absolutely necessary.  SWEs were not intentionally sabotaging the project.  They did the best they could with the skills they had.  Management doesn't complain about code quality so there is no issue from these SWEs perspective.\n\nThe SWEs at the majority of companies are not grinding DS&A or design patterns trying to get in to top tech companies.  They can code up features that do what they need to do and that's about it.  These companies are not trying to compete with big tech companies as they cannot come close to matching total compensation.\n\nThey try to sell themselves to SWEs in different ways, but it just attracts SWEs that:  (off the top of my head)\n\n* don't know the value of their talent\n* meet the companies bar, but would not be talented enough to get in to big tech companies for big pay\n* late in their career where they are financially secure to coast in a job\n\nSo this is a long way of saying, yes it's pretty common in the industry to have production ready code that is poorly designed.  I would even wager that is the expectation and not the expectation when you look at the industry at large and not a small slice like only big tech companies. \n\nI'd bet even if you went to look at some codebase at google there would be SWEs that say this is poorly designed we need to refactor.  Most of the time the refactor is now worth it and as a SWE you take it as a lesson learned for the next time you do the same or similar thing.",

Being a \"lead\" at a non-tech company managing an API with \"tens of thousand of requests\" does not mean you are entitled to a senior role at a tech company. \n\nYou got one (1) interview for what seems like an entry level role, and you fucked it. The Amazon SDE-1 interview process is possible THE MOST documented interview known to man, engineering or otherwise. There are more people taking that interview than there are engineers at your company. One (1) google search would have told you what to expect. There are YouTube videos, guides on Blind, Reddit posts, the list goes on. The fact that you simply prayed it would be leetcode and showed up and failed is on you. \n\nTo be honest, you're not really underpaid. I've worked at non-tech F500 companies and 100k in a L/M COL is about right for someone with your level of experience. If you want to get paid the big bucks, you need to be that good.",

May seem like a lot but it’s better than pretending to know. \n\nI’d recommend making a documentation of some kind on the codebase and being diligent in recording each step taken when doing a task. Then you can refer back to your notes and eventually it starts to paint an overall picture of the code base you are working on. \n\nFor example start by creating notes on the files in the code base you are most familiar with and then move on from there. Can even be 2-3 sentences if you don’t fully know - Auth.ts “This code deals with the security of client.” \n\nEventually with good documentation will help clear things up, good luck!",

This confidence comes from several sources depending on your environment and your team/org structure:\n\n1. Knowing who knows what. At large companies with lots of knowledge silos, this is probably the most important bit. Most likely, the unfamiliar bits of the codebase is also owned by them, so if you need to make changes there, you'd have to get their buy-in anyways\n2. Knowing how to find what you're looking for - both in terms of the codebase tooling (e.g. if you guys have a bespoke code search or repo management layer) as well as a high-level idea of how things are generally organized (and this usually goes back to #1) and how to trace through the difference packages, as well as relevant documents or memos that have documented relevant design discussions and decisions\n3. Having the (un)earned confidence that things will go well - I actually think this is the most important aspect. Most of the time, it's easier to just assume that you'll find what you're looking for and not fret too much about the task. This comes with time, and I find that not stressing out about unknowns is just as important as being competent in the domains you do know.",

I concluded it was way too complicated for what it did because it relied upon a convoluted ECS implementation to serve the frontend for no discernible reason (SPA , no server side rendering, never will need it given it's internal tooling with no need for major performance focus). I implemented a much simpler / cheaper way of hosting it as static content in S3 and ran it in parallel in dev as proof of concept.\n\nI spoke with our engineering manager who agreed it was a preferable approach and now we're integrating it to reduce architectural / build complexity.\n\nMy point being, don't just take tickets to solve the immediate problem. See if you can solve the upstream problem too. My initial ticket was some version bump needed of a dependency for security reasons but the underlying problem was that we were managing unnecessarily complex infrastructure to serve up a basic SPA frontend. I solved the version issue by just adopting a simpler deployment approach but I learnt along the way and got kudos from our engineering lead for improving a process.",

When I was looking last year, I received more callbacks from out-of-state than in-state (California). If you are a US citizen, apply to government companies all over the USA - I received almost 80% of callbacks on those.\n\nLeetcode is worth the effort as it help with interview, projects on the side - no in my opinion.",

Networking was by far the most beneficial and is what ultimately led to me landing my first position. \n\nI did have two strong projects on my resume my machine vision capstone project and a solo built web app with unit testing, end to end testing and source code analysis\n\nIf you are comfortable with networking or at least willing to put yourself out there and get better at it you will most likely be fine especially if you have one or two or more strong achievements from your internships/projects\n\nAdditionally, consider your financial situation. I had no school debt and had support from family while networking job searching\n\nLastly, I don’t think extra courses are going to make a huge difference. Extra projects that aren’t boiler plate, followed a tutorial word for word are much more useful.",

You may see people post LinkedIn premium stats where X% of people applying to an entry level role have a masters... but that doesn't mean they're *getting the role*.\n\nWhen a company is hiring for a regular SWE position that requires no specialized knowledge outside of a bachelors, if they see someone with a masters applying, all they see is a flight risk. They're not stupid. They know someone with a masters degree is just going to use that \"normal\" position as a stepping stone, and leave the moment they have a job lined up that has work utilizing their degree, and more importantly, pay reflecting the advanced degree.\n\nYou can claim that this is the job you want, and you're in it for the long term all you want.... but no sane company is going to believe you.\n\nNone of this is a problem if you're getting a masters/PhD in order to chase jobs that require a masters/PhD. It becomes a problem when you're using those degrees just to delay your entry into the market.\n\nStick it out with applying. Getting an internship sophomore year is pretty difficult. You'll likely have better luck after your Junior year. And even if you don't.... in my opinion your time is better spent in the market, applying until you get something lined up. Side note, are you applying to roles besides SWE? I did a PM internship after my sophomore year because that's all I could line up.

Many people build careers through certifications, strong portfolios, internships, and practical experience. What matters most is demonstrating that you can solve problems, learn quickly, and contribute.\n\nIf you enjoy programming, it’s worth thinking about ways to keep doing it without burning out. That could mean continuing your degree at a slower pace, taking a break, or focusing on building projects and internships that align with your goals. Leadership and managerial roles come later, and they often care more about results and experience than the exact degree.\n\nHonestly, there’s no perfect answer. Try weighing what will keep you motivated and learning while protecting your well-being. Even switching to a more flexible path can get you where you want without feeling trapped or behind.\n\nYou’re not “less than” anyone without a degree, what matters is what you DO with your skills and opportunities.",

Youre a new grad, dont worry about this. Pay attention to others around you and learn from this\n\nThree. Ask questions when youre stuck and cant solve something, but dont be annoying asking questions every time youre stuck, and dont never ask questions and stay stuck forever.

You arent expected to know much your first 6-12 months but at a certain point you wont be the youngest or newest person in the room so make sure you grow by then. You never know when they will start asking you questions and expect you know the answer to. \n\n\\- Ive started to use AI in my work and honestly it's really nie to understand the codebase. Use it as a pair programming tool. But dont rely on it too heavily. Make sure you understand what it's trying to convey. I have founda. few errors or things that the AI overlooks. I.e. I was trying to create a new print statement andasked the AI to go through it as it was a new field and needed to touch like 10 files. When i tested it, it wasnt working and i realized that at no point did the AI ever make sure that all the cases were covered because there was one case that would never hit because we never set that variable.\n\n\\- Ask questions and try to befriend older engineers. This is key. It's scary but you gotta play the game. The game isnt always getting as much out there, it's how your coworkers speak of you. Many jr engineers will twiddle their thumbs, SWEs hate that. Dont twiddle your thumbs, if you are stuck ask anybody. In stand up say, I am stuck. It goes a long way when you can say that openly.\n\n\\- when you complete something, show proof of it. Ask for 15 minutes post stand up to display in front of team. The team will lvoe that. \n\n\\-if you have a mentor, use that person but also try to cut the cord as quickly as you can. Ive seen jr engineers kind of cling to the mentor andwhenver they get stuck they just wait for the mentor to come back rom their 3 hour meeting even when they know where to go to but are too afraid of going themselves.",

I really like my new team and have come to gain their respect and trust over time. I have been performing well over my current job title for a long time now and It’s been an extremely frustrating experience all year to constantly be led on and be on this low wage honestly. I felt unmotivated and dejected at times, since I was working really hard at work to provide value etc.\n\nAnyway I was supposed to receive a promotion at the beginning of the year and have STILL not got it, it’s been getting stretched out for months on end. We are supposed to get it this month but we are now going to get an increase to 31k which is lower than what several other devs that are objectively much much worse than me are getting. All you can do is find a new job honestly, I have two final stage interviews lined up this month and will take either of them for a lot more money. TLDR: My company has been screwing me and other people over all year with our pay and now have two final interviews for a lot more pay lined up. All you can do really is go out in the market and get what you’re worth. I’ve been applying so much, it’s a big time sink but worth leaving a company severely underpaying you.",

I'm sure you can come up with ways to tie your software skills with freelancing. \n\n\nYou'd be surprised at how much people would shell out for simple plug-ins with the right marketing. \n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nI wish I had your skills.

        "body": "I started out as a FE dev and became a BE dev. Now I don't even want to touch anything FE, although I'm technically full-stack I'd only write BE on my resume. Backend code is always much cleaner, simpler, and easier to debug - but it requires knowledge of certain things you don't often think about as a FE dev.\n\nHere are my 2-cents of everything you need to know to be a GOOD BE dev.\n\nFirst of all, you need a general understanding of the internet itself. How it works, and why it is the way it is. You need to know what HTTP requests are and how they work. A BE dev is not a network engineer, but you still want to know what ports are, what UDP and TCP is. All BE development establishes connections to someone or something (most often databases, but depending on the product it could be establishing connections peer to peer or in any other way)\n\nAfter that, you need to understand that backend code is not like FE code. The same design and architectural patterns don't make sense. It helps to think of BE code as a series of completely isolated scripts that a computer will be processing. It doesn't run on a client, it's not available to a client, users have no idea what that code is and they will never see it or directly interact with it. In the simplest context, think of a simple user registration form. The frontend has some inputs it captures, and then it sends it to the backend for processing. The backend then does all of the work to make that registration actually happen with those inputs - which is most often inserting rows to the database.\n\nYou need to understand and be able to work with databases, you need to be able to read and write SQL. I can't think of any BE position where the code is not interacting with a database. In many instances, that's ALL the code is doing - interacting with a database.\n\nYou need to understand and be able to manage remote servers and web servers. Familiarity with unix.\n\nSecurity is a concern in BE development for sure, but generally common sense will go a long way and people often think some kind of over-engineering is required to have something secure. Have a properly secured server, with correctly set-up file permissions, whitelists, and firewalls. Don't set anything public that shouldn't be public. Don't store files or sensitive data in weird places. Don't store sensitive data like passwords in plain text. Don't install random packages and libraries that you're not 100% confident in and have a genuine use-case for. Don't work out of a system or computer that's potentially compromised. All validation must be properly handled in the backend, what the FE does is irrelevant in terms of security. Don't have any method someone could exploit to fire off code or SQL on your system. Use services like Cloudflare to help with spam reduction and bot detection. Keep all software/packages regularly updated (including the OS the server is on), and finally keep logs of everything including errors, accesses, requests, etc. Regardless of the scale of a product or application, if all of the above are met, the product will be completely secure from a BE perspective.\n\nOverall, I'd say there is a lot more power with backend development than there is with FE. There are more job opportunities for it, and there are just more things you can do in general. The code you write is not just something to be used exclusively for a client's UI - it can be used for quite literally anything, from the world's most complex sorting and filtering algorithms to data analytics to machine learning to whatever else. Lastly, I'd say the beauty of backend code is once it's written, it's made to last forever as long as the computer running it is still on. It's not subject to the change of forever-changing things like clients, npm packages, and designs. In other words, if someone wrote the backend script for a user registration form in 1990, it would be just as valid code as one made today.",

I joke to my coworkers that we’re all just data plumbers.\n\n\nHave you done system design interviews? That will honestly cover 80% of what you need to know for BE stuff, and every cloud host has their own version of the sys design components that you’ll study. The rest is LLD (which you likely already have experience with), dev ops if needed, and testing.",

If you want to specialize in the creative side of things you'll need to work on developing more advanced technical skills such as graphics/shader programming, webGPU/webGL, Three.js, and etc. to distinguish yourself. \n\nI believe the general industry title for such roles is \"creative developer\" - basically a developer with a focus on the areas I mentioned alongside all the existing requirements of a frontend developer. Demand for this skill set is infrequent - most projects that involve this kind of work are usually advertising/marketing related and are typically contracted to web design agencies or freelancers in the field. On rare occasions larger companies may selectively recruit a few of these roles but career-wise I don't think it's very viable long term unless you have the right connections and can distinguish yourself with a strong portfolio.\n\nI personally think working as a regular frontend developer is a much more preferable position to be in in terms of career progression and compensation. That being said however if you're passionate about this then you should continue to pursue it inside and outside of work whenever you can - often times in your career you'll stumble upon opportune moments, so having the right skill set at the right time can definitely lead you down a desirable path!",

Most front end devs are making client apps with enterprise applications where the UX insights to be mindful of are about making it intuitive to sort through complicated workflows with lots of data.  If you know how to target those more creative roles, great, but I have had to use far less of my graphic design skills even while working on e commerce and retail platforms.  Learn what you love and interests you, but you need to balance your learning towards in demand, marketable skills earlier in your career.

With a master's in electrical or computer engineering, and even possibly without one, someone with a CS degree could get a job at any of the following: Cadence/Altium/etc. writing EDA software, Micron/Atmel/Marvel writing RTL abstraction, TI working on DSP compilers and kernels, ST on IDEs/programmers/debuggers, etc.\n\nThose are just examples I have some familiarity with, and they're mostly in the US.\n\nYou don't even necessarily need semiconductor knowledge for all of these roles. Pretty much across the board though you will need to have extensive knowledge of systems programming, C/C++, and probably some amount of embedded/peripheral device knowledge for even the EDA roles.\n\nThat all being said, this poster says \"fullstack and a CS degree.\" Some university CS programs are not particularly helpful to get in to this world, and fullstack / web development / computer networking all have virtually no relevance here. If this poster would not be comfortable writing C and/or C++ professionally, a master's would be a good place to start.",

Even the more software-y positions like compiler work are mostly C++ as you mentioned (and damned difficult to get into and do as a newish graduate)\n\nThe usual advice I'd give would be to look into openings for USA jobs for semiconductor and see what's available. Manufacturing side not as much but engineering or tooling wise there's a lot of companies doing that kind of work, but whether there's jobs is not clear.",

I don't think it's at all accurate to say that \"the jobs are overseas.\" The global semiconductor software market is large, and the US market is still a huge player. I don't even know if it's accurate to say that this domain in the US has upskilled, so much as computing generally has blown up to a become a much broader field, and so the semiconductor domain has passively/relatively become more specialized over time.\n\nI don't even think it's necessarily accurate to say that these jobs are hard to get. They're more specialized, and they mostly default to recruiting from a few universities with relevant EE/CE/EECS programs because those are the few programs that reliably prepare new grads for the jobs.\n\nNow, the reality is that most American CS graduates have looked at an increasingly global semiconductor market, the difficulty of having to learn an enormous amount of theory and practical skills, increasing competition from technical graduates from universities in India/China/Korea/Southeast Asia, and the risks of over-specializing in a software domain, and by and large chosen to go into full stack/web development instead.\n\nI would need more information to give individual advice on this topic, and I would strongly caution against going into this field for the money. Semiconductor/embedded work can still be unbelievably lucrative, even as an employee and not as a founder or early hire, but in most cases the dividends come when people are long into their career and can author patents and papers or manage large projects.",
