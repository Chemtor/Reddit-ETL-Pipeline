My initial reaction to it was how well thought out it was and how well documented. It felt like a db platform built to address the pain points of battle weary DW practitioners.\n\nThroughout my career I've seen \"Tech X is better than Tech Y, why can't people see that\". It depends on whether those advantages are relevant to your business. There are always pain points. What impact, if any, do these have on your business and do they negate the advantages.\n\nI worked for a consultancy that was a Snowflake partner. We worked out how to run Snowflake, and other SaaS tech at very low cost.  As a Snowflake partner, this made us as popular with them as hemorrhoids in a spacehopper race.\n\nWhat people forget in Tech X vs Tech Y arguments, particularly in the SaaS world, is that both are watching each other, evolving, copying/stealing features. Yesterday, Tech X was ahead, today Tech Y is ahead, tomorrow, who knows?\n\nRemember too, it isn't the size of the wand, its the magic of the magician.  Lets suppose you can query infinite data infinitely fast. Management take one look at the results, don't like them and send your team off on weeks worth of wild goose chases to determine why the figures don't match their perceptions if what ought to be. Even if you prove the figures are accurate they are likely to insist they are wrong because the data on which the results are based didn't include other factors.",

If your processed data already resides on their platform, it's understandable you get dazzled by these new offerings because it is easy to use all of them and even faster to get a POC out in front of the executives.

Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering. A *data engineer* manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.\n\nData engineering as a fundamental concept is always going to be the same, but how this is accomplished has evolved and changed over time. The scale of data has become larger, the requests for data have become more complex, and the data engineering solutions have changed. \n\nThe decoupling of compute and storage has been a big deal over the last 2 decades. The rise of columnar storage has made OBT a viable solution over Kimball's strict dimensional modeling. Kafka has changed how data can be incrementally ingested. \n\nMore recently, there has been a mainstream shift towards data mesh architectures, eliminating a need for a centralized data warehouse. Policy driven access control and dynamic data masking has changed how data governance is enforced. Snowflake and Databricks are continuing to gain market share. LLM's are changing what needs to be delivered to stakeholders.",

First, it's a bank. Despite their desire and rhetoric it is not a tech company. The people in charge of technology have no idea what they are doing and because it is a bank they get to mandate their will without requiring buy in from engineering. I remember reading a blog post from Uber about their CICD initiative and how they couldn't just force their colleagues to use it. At Capital One you can roll out the biggest piece of shit and then mandate it's adoption across the company to the detriment of everyone.\n\n\nSecond, their absolutely insane performance management system completely cripples the company. I don't think I can return until they fix it and they never will until Rich retires.\n\n\nHaving to continuously fire the bottom fifteen percent performers is insane. I'm all for firing non performers but it requires the ability to identify who is performing. I've been in performance management meetings where I was the only other person who could open GitHub. If you're going to do extreme performance management then you need to have the ability to actually know who is getting work done. Instead, it's completely based on narrative. People who cannot code, do not know you or your product, will decide your merit. It is insane and stupid and many good engineers flee the company for the reasons mentioned above.\n\n\nThat said, there are very good people who for either spite or stubbornness (like myself) stick it out and try to make it a better place. They really are doing shit no other bank can. There are very good teams doing interesting work and very toxic teams where you will get fucked.\n\n\nJust like life it's a mixed bag. They pay well and if you aren't a coward you can learn a lot from those few awesome engineers holding down the fort. Take the money ride the wave and see where it takes you. ",

Improves query performance: You can perform faster query execution on smaller tables that have undergone normalization.\n>  1. Minimizes **update anomalies**: With normalized tables, you can easily update data without affecting other records.\n>  1. Enhances data integrity: It ensures that data remains consistent and accurate.\n\nAnyway, I'll encourage you to skim their section about \"update anomalies\" and focus on the examples.",

That makes it possible to handle massive historical datasets without expensive SSD clusters or rebalancing.\n\nFrom a performance standpoint, we’ve benchmarked Arc using ClickBench, the industry-standard analytical test suite.\n\nOn identical hardware (AWS c6a.4xlarge), Arc outperforms TimescaleDB and InfluxDB by a wide margin.\n\nWithout cache: Arc ranks #8 out of 60+ systems.\n\nWith cache: it climbs to #3 overall, just behind DuckDB and ClickHouse.\n\nBenchmarks and details here: [https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#performance-benchmark-](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#performance-benchmark-), here too: [https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#clickbench-results](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc?tab=readme-ov-file#clickbench-results)\n\nIn short, DuckDB gives Arc its analytics speed, but Arc extends that into a scalable, long-term time-series warehouse that can economically retain and query billions of records using Parquet and object storage.",

I actually dug a bit into Delta Lake and SeaweedFS after your comment, both are super interesting projects.\n\nFrom what I see, Delta Lake (or delta-rs) is more data-lake oriented, strong on ACID transactions, schema evolution, and batch updates. Arc’s focus is a bit different: it’s built for continuous ingestion and fast time-based queries, where writes are append-only and most performance comes from how data is partitioned and scanned, not from transactional updates.\n\nRight now, MinIO is the default because it’s stable, simple, and S3-compatible, which makes it easy to run Arc anywhere (local, on-prem, or cloud).\n\nThat said, we’re still very early in the journey, and the storage layer isn’t locked in stone, we’ll definitely explore other options if they offer better trade-offs in performance or availability. Thanks for the SeaweedFS suggestion, we’ll plan to run some tests and look into supporting it as a storage backend.",

Then costs get bumped up the prioritization ladder so code is refactored and things are turned off that should've been turned off a while ago, then the costs go down so the org prioritizes building new things and the cycle repeats. New tools/processes are occasionally thrown into the mix to help out with costs as well.",

I was serving a corporate meeting dinner and spilled a whole gravy boat down some important person's suit jacket.\n\nTo echo what my old manager said to somebody who kept apologising, nobody wants to hear apologies.  Everybody just wants to see improvement.\n\nFirst thing is hold yourself to high standards.  Give yourself a rule - you're allowed to make mistakes once.  Once you mess up, you make adjustments to fix it.  I am quite forgetful and give myself a lot to do although I've found writing down a list of actions for a project, prioritising them, and then going through them one by one was great for my organisation.\n\nSecond is to also be kind to yourself.  Care about what you can control, accept that shit happens for things you can't.  If you miss an edge case that you can't predict, then honestly, there's no point beating yourself up about it.  \n  \nI'll give you another story - I was getting a user reporting a migration \"wasn't correct\" even though it was 100% exactly the same as it was before.  \"I don't see these characters that are appearing before.  They're there now.  The migration has failed\", they said.  If you look at it with the naked eye, you'd be right.  They don't exist...IN THE SQL DATABASE.  When converted to parquet they show up.  Shit was literally invisible to the naked eye and to the IDE looking at the text in SQL, but if you go and look at the fucking location specific character encoding and convert it, it is 100% there.\n\nThis comes with experience.  Some things cannot be helped.  Mistakes will always happen.  It's how we handle them after which defines us as people.",

I see no reason as to why it should not be a breeze, though I have not used CDGC and DBT together yet.\n\n> Can we kick of DBT loads from informatica after ingesting the data?\n\nYes. You can execute your tasks on command line or use the API and track the jobs through there if you need. \nBut if you already have an orchestrator, why push that into Informatica? Informaticas catalog can get lineage etc anyway.\n\n> Is it DBT better or should we need to stick with snowflake sps? \n\nNot sure what you mean. \nDepends on situation and circumstances.\n\n\nYou can use cdgc, data lineage, data quality and profiling in Informatica, without having Informatica to handle your ingestion or transformation. Or you can if you wish. Remember you can go to docs.informatica.com and download the scanners' document on DBT if you you wan't to know what is supported. Or any other systems you might thave, that Informatica supports. If you are to touch these tools you should have gotten an account so you can get the information that is requires an account. Haven't ever understood why some parts of the documentation requires an account, really.",

Garbage in, garbage out still applies, and with AI models relying on massive, reliable datasets, the demand for skilled data engineers, data architects, and analysts is only going to grow.\n\nThe point about ultra high integrity data is key. Companies will need to rethink their entire data strategy, from ingestion to processing to validation, because legacy systems just will not cut it. The AI wave does not replace humans. It raises the bar for the humans managing data. In fact, those who understand how to design systems that consistently produce high-quality data will be more in demand than ever.\n\nIt is not just about feeding AI. It is about building a data-first infrastructure that can power analytics, operational applications, and AI-driven products simultaneously. Exciting times for anyone in data engineering or data strategy.",

AI makes garbage data problems exponentially worse because now you're making bad decisions at scale. So yeah, demand for proper data engineering should go up.\n\nWhere it gets interesting is AI might change what data engineering looks like. The tedious stuff like basic ETL scripts and transformations, that's already getting easier. But the hard problems? Understanding messy legacy systems, making architectural decisions, and figuring out data lineage in nightmare scenarios that still need humans who know what they're doing.\n\nThe bit about companies needing to restart their data operations rings true. I've seen organisations realise their data is basically unusable for anything sophisticated and having to retrofit quality controls they should've had from day one.\n\nI reckon junior roles doing routine work might shift, but experienced data engineers who can actually solve complex problems? They'll be fine. Probably busier than ever.\n\nWhat's your experience been? Are you seeing companies actually investing in proper data quality or just hoping AI magically fixes it?",

If you want to sell yourself as a consultant, make sure you have the experience to know what you're doing. Then all other questions (how to do it, how to scale, how much will it cost) solve themselves.\n\nIf you don't have the experience and you want to learn at the cost of the client, make sure to tell them upfront. Otherwise you're building something that won't fit their needs, and that won't be able to adapt to their future needs. Something like this wouldn't sell, even if it's free.\n\nI would recommend joining an established data team as an junior employee or consultant for 2 to 5 years, until you've mastered one niche in the field. You might need to pitch as a data analyst instead of a DE, because DE is typically not seen as a junior-level job.",

Keep costs tiny by using on-demand pricing, turning off BI Engine, setting maximum bytes billed in every query/source, and materializing small summary tables for Looker Studio. For speed, use Extract Data in Looker Studio on top of your fact tables. \n\n\n\nFor handoff/sell: include a cost dashboard, a runbook (schemas, schedules, service account permissions), version-controlled SQL in a client-owned repo, and a light maintenance retainer. I’ve paired dbt Core and Airbyte for ETL, with DreamFactory when I needed a quick secure REST API layer for Apps Script or external tools. \n\n\n\nBottom line: client-owned GCP, BigQuery with cost guards, and precomputed models over Sheets hacks.",

If you do not care to, for example, be notified of schema changes like type changes or field additions, or you have a limited nr of fields and you want to type manually, then maybe you do not care. If you do care, the discussion ends here - let dlt discover schema and accept the limitation that comes along. \n\nThat being said, there is also also a benefit to using json in db - the data is pre-joined so retrieval of nested data is faster than re-joining tables. For this reason we are working to add typed complex data support to give you nested with schema discovery option where supported by the destination.\n\nIf you do not care to manage schema then let's talk about the raw data  - there is a benefit to storing json for debugging. My personal preference is to use a mounted drive and persist the extract and normalize packages (raw and normalised pre-loading) data in a bucket with <30d deletion (serves debugging and implies with gdpr without extra management), or to load via a staging bucket. IMO json does not belong in SQL because once it's there you havw to take it out to be able to use proper tooling to handle it.  \n  \nregarding raw data - dlt doesn't change the data, so if you want to just debug the data, you can debug it in db. dlt does change metadata such as column names, adds types, or removes null-only columns (they have no data, cannot be typed)",

Why:\n- being too specific with LLMs kills their agency. Semantic/metric layers often even define how you sort the data. It’s good for dashboards and such but not for exploratory analysis usually triggered by prompting — recommended read: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents\n\n- semantic layers are (due to how specific they need to be) are long and never ending projects.

Edit: I see that you say the MI has Admin permission in the Fabric workspace, so you should be covered there already. If the notebook and warehouse are in different workspaces, the MI will probably need at least Contributor in both workspaces. It doesn't need to have any permissions on the capacity.\n\nPerhaps the .synapsesql() just doesn't work when triggered by MI.

No, it should not be relevant here. Storage blob roles are Azure roles. In Fabric, the Workspace Contributor (or Member/Admin) is what matters.",

Worst case I can use the NB to pull and write to the adls then use a copy data task in ADF to push to the wh as that seems to work.was just hoping to skip extra steps.\n\nThanks for those links I will have a look through, seems like there are quite a few cases.\n\nThanks for the info on the az role, I wasn't sure if it would need access to the Fabric capacity resource which sits in azure and has azure roles as it's required for some other tasks.\n\nThanks again!",

But they agree on Parquet, Deletion vectors, and I believe they've just aligned on geospatial data types too. So they're very similar and as a result, can be made interoperable. \n\nShould you prefer Iceberg or Delta Lake as your \"preferred\" catalog or open table format? Jury still seems to be out. \n\nBut if you end up wanting to change your preferred format, or end up needing to speak multiple to interface with tools that only handle one, that's very doable these days thanks to tools like Apache XTable.\n\nSee https://xtable.apache.org/. It can translate between Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi metadata, without needing to duplicate the data itself. \n\nDisclosure: my employer contributes to Apache XTable (and offers table format virtualization et cetera as part of Microsoft OneLake: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-iceberg-tables)\n\nNot trying to sell you anything here though - Apache XTable is OSS and thus free to run on-premise of course (except for the hardware itself and your time, of course). If you have e.g. S3 api compatible blob storage on premise, believe it's supported: https://xtable.apache.org/docs/how-to\n\nAlso has nice docs on integrating with various other catalogs: https://xtable.apache.org/docs/catalogs-index",

In other words, a majority of this complexity is just the result of compensating for platform gaps, which ends up destroying maintainability and predictability.\n\nMy $0.02 - go with a platform that provides a declarative (as opposed to imperative) approach, where you focus on the data flow/transformation, and the platform handles the failures in a predictable manner. \n\n* If you are already on databricks, delta live tables are it. \n* If you are exploring alternatives and want something lighter weight, tabsdata is a good alternative that you can run on your laptop and expand on later. \n\nBoth these systems will allow you to use your favorite python tools without having to worry about orchestration overhead and failures etc.",

It also saves time.\n   * You can expand the list of sources that you cover. You can take a look at ready-made platforms or open-source tools to ingest data from all these different sources you need.\n   * At this stage, the data would land in a place you control in a certain layout and structure at least.\n* In terms of formats, the answer would depend very heavily on the types of formats:\n   * If you have machine-readable formats like JSON, CSV, Excel files, Parquet files, and whatnot, this just becomes an orchestration problem, throw a data pipeline tool on it and you are golden.\n   * I presume that's not the only thing, since you give the PDF example. Parsing PDFs with varying schemas over time is a hell I don't wish my worst enemies to go through, so that's not easy.\n   * I have recently played around with Mistral's OCR model to extract a bunch of invoice data and it worked flawlessly, tackled \\~95% of our incoming invoices.\n   * This would still require you to build a data pipeline solution around this, where the underlying work would be done by an AI model that would extract the structured data.\n   * Once you have the structured data out, you would store this data in a data warehouse or a data lake with a clear schema and structure.\n\nFrom this point onwards, you would have a:\n\n* Central lake where you store the raw files\n* A data warehouse / data lake where you store the extracted and structured data\n\nThis would theoretically get you to a better place. Obviously, what I wrote above contains a huge list of assumptions, but hopefully it helps with the general idea.",

For each source object, canonicalize JSON (sorted keys) or extract PDF text, then compute a doc hash and per-chunk hash; skip unchanged docs and only re-embed chunks whose hash changed. Track docid, sourceurl, lastseenetag, dochash, embedmodel, embedversion, chunkid, chunkhash, qdrantid, status, and pagination watermarks. DynamoDB works well (GSIs on status/source + TTL for old versions), though Postgres is fine if you want richer queries. In Temporal, run per-document workflows with chunking/embedding as children; batch Qdrant upserts and use idempotency keys like hash(docid|chunkidx|embedversion). Keep S3 versioning and a manifest so you can replay safely. In Qdrant, index payload fields (docid, version), and retire old vectors by version when a doc changes. Airbyte and AWS Glue handled odd API pulls for us; DreamFactory helped when we had to auto-generate REST APIs from legacy DBs to keep ingestion consistent. Add the metadata DB early and rely on hashing/versioning so updates don’t blow up your pipeline.",

When a second “one-time” fix shows up, you’ll wish you had either a small overrides table or Type 2. I’d lean to a separate overrides table keyed by the business key with columns overridevalue, overriddenat, overriddenby, reason; then finalvalue = COALESCE(overridevalue, sourcevalue). That lets you revoke, reapply, and report on overrides without touching the base record. If you keep it inline, make origvalue immutable, add updatedat/updatedby/reason, and guard the update path so file uploads can’t rewrite origvalue.\n\nPerformance-wise, COALESCE on a nullable override column is cheap; just index the business key. Keep raw in bronze, compute final in silver, and document the rule. Fivetran and dbt handled this cleanly for me, and DreamFactory exposed a small CRUD API so ops could edit the override table safely.\n\nSo yes, your approach works, just enforce immutability and plan for audits or use an overrides table.",

It sucks because you could be a perfectly competent data engineer who builds solid pipelines without knowing every detail of the DAG scheduler or executor memory management, but some companies use these deep theory questions as a filtering mechanism. The frustrating part is there's no universal standard - one company wants you to explain catalyst optimizer stages, another just wants to see you write a working transformation. Your best bet is to have a baseline understanding of the theory (what happens when you call an action vs transformation, basic execution model, why shuffles are expensive) but don't kill yourself memorizing every architectural detail unless you're targeting companies known for this style of interviewing.\n\nThe shift in how you prepare should really depend on the signals you're getting from your interviews. If you're consistently hitting walls on theory questions, then yeah, dedicate more time to understanding the \"why\" and \"how\" beneath the surface. But if you're getting through technical rounds and failing elsewhere, your time might be better spent on system design, communication skills, or just doing more practice problems. The truth is most associate-level work doesn't require you to debug Spark's physical plan daily, but being able to speak intelligently about it shows depth of knowledge that some interviewers value highly.\n\nIf you want help for these unpredictable theory questions when they come up, I built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of curveball interview scenarios.",

At deploy time, read the registry and build assets with consistent keys like source.table; new tables mean a small config change, not new code. Use SourceAsset for cross-repo dependencies and auto-materialize policies to keep downstream models up to date.\n\nPartition raw by ingestion date (daily/hourly), then map partitions downstream; avoid per-table custom partitions unless there’s a real reason. Cap fan-out with multi-asset nodes for shared transforms. Sensors: file sensors for landing zones, plus a “schema drift” sensor that diffs metadata and opens a PR to update the registry so assets get generated on the next deploy. Testing: unit-test asset functions with buildassetcontext, add asset checks for row counts/nulls, and layer Great Expectations or pandera where needed.\n\nI’ve used Airbyte for ingestion and dbt for transforms; in a few cases DreamFactory auto-generated REST APIs on top of legacy DBs so Dagster could pull from them without custom services.\n\nShort version: keep core assets static, generate raw assets from metadata.",

As an example, Docker comes from the realm of virtualization- the technique of nesting one or more virtual machines inside of a bare metal hypervisor.  Virtualization comes from emulation- reading code made for one type of machine and converting it in real-time to run on the actual machine- Java is an example, being built on the \"Java Virtual Machine.\"\n\n\nEmulation actually has much older roots, though- it dates back to when mainframes were the most common way to get things done. It was common for mainframes to be used to emulate several early microcomputer for software development to test programs that were meant to be cross-compiled before Windows became dominant. And old programs made for older mainframes would sometimes be supported via emulation to allow businesses to upgrade their equipment as technology improved.\n\n\nThis all comes down to one of the most important skills in programming: the ability to take one big problem, and break it down into smaller sub-problems that are easier to answer. When you go deep enough into a computer, you will see that the whole thing is basically the idea of a lightswitch, on or off, just repeated billions and trillions of times.",

The special thing about a system call is that it allows *user* code (running with low privileges) to call *kernel* code (running with high privileges) in a controlled way.\n\nThe kernel can \"receive\" syscalls from user code, but within the kernel itself, plain old function calls are used. If you read the source code for Linux, which is written in C, you'll mostly just see a lot of functions calling other functions.\n\nIn terms of what those function calls within the kernel actually *do*: sometimes they just manipulate data, like any other function you might write yourself. For instance, the \"list of running processes\" is a kernel data structure, so when you start a new process running with the `fork` and `exec` syscalls, you're just calling kernel code that adds a new entry to that list.\n\nSimilarly, when you use a syscall like `write` to \"print\" text from your program, normally what you're really doing is writing characters to a queue (a.k.a. a pipe or FIFO). Some other part of the system (e.g. a terminal emulator) is going to read those characters and figure out how to display them on the screen. The queue itself belongs to the kernel, so programs use syscalls to ask the kernel to read and write it.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the kernel code has to manipulate hardware. It usually does this by accessing special memory addresses ([memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O)) which read or write the corresponding registers in a hardware device. The kernel's higher privilege level allows it to do this directly. User code is normally forbidden from doing this by the CPU's memory protection hardware.",

It's a good video.\n\nBut really it's because the thing you call \"time\" isn't just one thing. The measurement unit and restriction physicists and astronomers need and grapple with isn't really identical to the social construct involved in your alarm clock. The laws of physics, the laws of a country and the laws of an economic zone aren't even laws in the same sense.\n\nE.g. one difference between unix time and UTC is [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second). There are a few different strategies to dealing with this on computers, like making the seconds slightly longer throughout the day, or adding a 61st second to a relevant minute, which may be enumerated as either `59, 60, 00` or `59, 59, 00`. All of the options fuck with software that has no clue what a leap second is.\n\nAnother example: [Sidereal years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year) aren't the same thing as the thing you're used to thinking of as a year (here's a nice [veritasium video on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUHkTs-Ipfg)).\n\nAnd those are just physics problems. In addition you've got all the social problems involved in timezones as the other commenters have gone into.\n\n\"Time\" is a simple word hiding a lot of horribly complex ideas. So the implementations wind up complex too.\n\nAnd then usually they get something wrong, or become unwieldy in attempts to become more correct, and are replaced with something that is promised to be more pleasant to use.",

In other words, I am very product-oriented.\n\nThink of a product that you actually want to exist in the real world. It's okay if the thing you want to build happens to be in existence already, just don't make \"clones\" of things that already exist. Like don't go make a Twitter clone because you'll get bored before you can solve the fun problems and there are about a thousand videos showing you every step of solving said problems. Not fun, not unique, not impressive, not engaging in my opinion.\n\nThat being said, there's nothing wrong with going forward with your own social media idea and forging your own path. I would even encourage you to do so if that's what you are interested in. And you can take inspiration from how existing products handle certain problems. That's a common practice. Copy the high-performers. Aggregate existing solutions from difference sources to create a new output.\n\nThe real gains are when you see a gap in the real world that technology can fill and then you capitalize on it. No good app to do some random thing that would be really cool if it existed? Build that app. Deploy it. Tell people about it. Maybe they will use it. Improve said app based on feedback. Maybe they will tell their friends. Next thing you know you have learned a world of information and built skills you didn't know existed.\n\nThat's how I stayed engaged. Not the path for everyone.",

Why are there 3 layers of indirection? Wat is this ;-; ?? \".   \n  \nThe gap isn't about raw coding skill - its about how \"professional\" code is shaped - it doesnt simply \\*work\\*, but is architected to survive years of changes, changing requirements, multiple contributors and weird edge cases. What seperates a Jr. SWE from Sr. SWE is more about instinct, rather than pure DSA knowledge. \n\n1. Read the classics.  \nReading literature is a great way to learn theory of things and new patterns.   \nStuff like *Design Patterns*, *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, *Anti-Patterns*, *A Philosophy of Software Design*, *Clean Code -* not saying you gotta drop everything and read them \\*right now\\*, but imo those are some of the books that kinda live on the must-read list for devs at some point.\n\n2. Rewrite your own old code.  \nGrab a project you wrote quite a time ago and try to read it like you weren't the one who made it. Start asking yourself questions. Bonus: refactoring is way easier and faster now, because your \"thinking level\" has leveled up since then. You would be seeing it more as a system and not just a bunch of code glued together.\n\n3. Try contributing to large OSS projects.  \nTips:  \n\\- Dont just read the code - look at the directory structure, the test layout, how errors propagate.   \n\\- Look into how they are documenting it, how they introduce breaking changes, logging and observability.  \n\\- Notice how they isolate I/O, how they handle state across the application, how they make things testable.  \n  \nThe feedback you are going to receive in your PRs is going to be invaluable (even if sometimes served cold). Soft skills become more and more important the further you go in your career. You may write the cleanest code in the world, but if you can't explain your thinking, review someone else's PR and give them feedback or advocate for better design - it is going to hold you back. Communication is \\*key\\*.\n\n**TL;DR:**   \nReal-world code is about making it last. The instinct you will develop from experience, mistakes and seeing how big systems fail and evolve is going to shape how you design, develop and debug . Read literature to get the theory, revisit (and refactor) your own old code and see your growth, study bit open-source projects. Also, communication matters more than people admit.",

Evaluate your toolchain periodically, using a good IDE, updated compiler versions, linters, static analysis, continuous integration, etc. and treat compiler warnings as hard errors.\n\n\n2. Production code has what will probably look to you like an insane amount of error-handling code and error/debug logging. It's there for a reason. Amateurs like my former self are satisfied letting an app crash with a cryptic message.\n\n\n3. Similarly, an apparently huge quantity of unit test code. Former me was focused on \"getting the code to work\", but if it only works for the happy-path cases, that's not nearly good enough.\n\n\n4. Once it's working and tested, resist the urge to go changing things willy-nilly. When you change something, anything at all, you run the risk of introducing errors. Don't change things unless you have a good reason.\n\n\n5. If you observe something about your code that you don't understand, any kind of unexplained behavior... don't stop working until you DO understand it. It's very often an error lurking. Don't ignore it.\n\n\nThere's lots more. Again, you learn best by working with professionals and shipping software to real users.",

There was no Google and I had a \"secret codebook\" with some simple programming details, and I taught myself from there until I took a class in high school on C++. It's *way* easier to learn now. So yes, I would argue you can definitely do it!\n\nThe key thing is to start small. Take things one step at a time. Don't add a game engine before you know what a variable or condition is. You don't need to finish the whole [Harvard CS50 course](https://www.youtube.com/cs50) before you open a game engine, but at least a few intro videos can be a big help.\n\nFor game engines, both Unity and Godot are popular for beginners. Godot is easier to start with (simpler, no setup), Unity has more jobs/resources. Both are great choices.\n\nEither way, I'd take one of many online programming courses in Python or C\\# before jumping into an engine, or perhaps dig into the CS50 course for more structured learning. A game engine adds a bunch of concepts on top of programming that are specific to the engine. If you want to jump in with both feet, that's fine, but you may struggle with information overload. If that happens, I recommend taking a break from the game engine and going back to programming basics, then trying the engine again when you feel more comfortable.\n\nGood luck!",

And I was less solely focused on game dev, I was more overall into scripting/automation/etc, so that’s not to say its not possible if you put more effort into it; again especially because back then you just had one or two good youtube video series and the rest was crack open the books.. and asking questions was pulling teeth, unlike today with AI, etc",

GameMaker Studio is free or $99 for a non console license and games like Stardew Valley were made with it. \n\nYou can own a car and not be a mechanic. \n\n\nThere are 5 minute - 15 minute tutorials in GMS that will show you how to use the software to make different simple concepts.

Those of us who are ESL will very likely speak with an accent but can still be very capable at English, and without mixing languages all the time (if anything the contamination seems to go more the other way when younger people with a smaller vocabulary are overexposed to anglophone memes).\n\nSignificant semantic differences like that of string mutability should become reflexive over time, though you may also find that your expectations gravitate towards the strictest among the languages you usually use, as you don't get errors for being more conservative than you strictly need to be.\n\nThere are some things that are more trivial differences that I think you'll just have to live with though, like whether it's `s.trim()` or `s.strip()`, or `len(xs)` vs `xs.len()`. For those you basically just have to have a language server or some other step to catch your goofs. You'll be able to fix it immediately as soon as you get the feedback because you ultimately know the semantics you want and you do know both variants, but made a mistake on the level of a spelling mistake. (And of course it's possible to stumble into spelling mistakes that result in valid grammar with different semantics, just like in human languages.)\n\nSo I expect that I'll get the case right for `bool`/`Bool` because I can remember that convention for a given language, but I _will_ mix up whether or not it ends with `-ean` because that's not really something I can reason my way into.",

        "body": "This is an entire field called GIS. The short of it is that you have two basic types of GeoSpatial data, vector and raster. Vector data is basically a table of attributes, but one of the fields has a geometry. Think Latitude and Longitude for points, and then just an array of those for Lines / Polygons. Raster Data is an image that you drape over your canvas, but it has embeded or an extra file with information saying where and how to place the image, like a tiff world ‘.tfw’ file.\n\nAny geospatial data will have a spatial reference for the coordinates, like WGS84 for your typical lat longs in decimal degrees or degree, minutes, seconds. Not knowing your spatial reference is a good way to get your data to show up off the eastern coast of Africa on null island.\n\nAnyway, for vector data, like roads, the road name will be stored in a field in the table and can be displayed as a label. Rasters obviously can’t really store data as a field, but they can be used to store data like imagery (rgb values from satellites), elevation, land use classifications, whatever where you need a value for every spot on the map.\n\nNow you have all this data, collected at the municipal, State/Provincial, and Federal levels, but how you need to put it on a map. You could make static maps (pdfs or images) using desktop software like QGIS or ArcGIS, or you could make the data available through a Map Server or WMS/WFS service and then have a web map the requests the data from those servers. The web server is usually something like QGIS Server or ArcGIS server, and then you consume it using a map library like leaflet, open layers, or ArcGIS JavaScript API. \n\nOf course, over the internet, this can be slow depending on the size of the data, so then you start getting into tiling your data. So for rasters, you’ve pre-tiled your data (vector and raster can do this) at different zoom levels, so as a user pans around a map, they’re only calling the specific tiles they need to display on the map instead of asking for the server to constantly clip and send the data they need for their extent. \n\nAnyways, that’s my quick intro, and each of those areas could be greatly expanded upon.",

The cartographers' term for these imagery maps is \"orthophotomap\".  They aren't satellite maps, but they play them on TV. \n\nWeb servers spit out those images as \"tiles\". The web map viewers have all sorts of fancy Javascript to retrieve, scale, and rotate those tiles so they look seamless. If you watch your map app you can see it retrieving and displaying tile-by-tile.\n\nYou can see, especially in more remote areas, the swaths of imagery. Maybe one swath was taken in the spring, and another in the fall. So they look a bit different.\n\nThe features, I think Google has their own streets-and-borders-and-rivers data. OpenStreetMap.org has a crowdsourced and quite excellent freely available database like that. With nice APIs.  Good good stuff. You could make a very interesting student project with it if you wanted to.\n\nI once worked at a map-making company that got hired to make a super high rez orthophotomap of O'Hare International Airport near Chicago. Our pilot got an earful from Air Traffic Control when he tried to get them to let him do his job flying back and forth over the field at 600ft above ground level. He had to get the top airport executive and some ATC honcho to go together up to the tower and personally tell the controllers to cooperate. No visible swaths in that job!",

Rarely can you get all three at once.\n\nObject-oriented programming and functional programming are approaches for managing system complexity. With OOP, you're defining components as \"objects\" with specific functionalities so that you have a system-wide vocabulary for what things do. Furthermore, by making things modular, you limit how much you have to fit in your head at any one time in order to change the system.\n\nWith functional programming, you're trying to isolate state to as few places as possible and keep all your functions throughout your system simple and deterministic, so when you're writing a function you have a finite number of ways that function can behave and it's simple to create, write, and test.\n\nI have met very few engineers who understand why OOP and FP are desirable. They just follow them dogmatically because they were taught them in college and don't know how to do things another way. Furthermore, they often do them wrong. They think simply using functions is FP or just defining boilerplate objects is OOP without actually writing coherent modules to reduce system complexity.\n\nIf you'd like a more robust discussion on this, my favorite book on the topic is \"A Philosophy of Software Design\" by John Ousterhout.

In this case, it's nice to be able to pull in just the external data definitions, and not the rest of the class.\n\n\nIt's been a while, so I can't remember off the top of my head how this shows up when you hit a circular include, but keep it in mind as you start to add more features.",

They're not mutually exclusive.\n\nThere are products that are open-source, but they charge money for it. The motivations can range here - maybe the source is open to promote trust, maybe it's open so that hobbyists can access it for free while business users can pay for support.\n\nThere are also products that are closed-source, but free to consumers. I'm sure you can think of plenty of examples of this.\n\nSo in your case, I think the answer depends on the target market.\n\nIf your goal is to reach as many non-tech-savvy end users as possible, then no this is not a common approach. The vast majority of users will not go through the hassle of getting an API key. What most companies do is figure out a way to monetize the app sufficiently to pay for the usage. Maybe that means all users pay a fee, maybe it means ads.\n\nA really, really common solution is for the product to be free to most customers, but the \"top\" users pay more and that subsidizes the costs for everyone else.\n\nAs an example the game Geoguessr depends heavily on the Google Maps API, which costs money. They let free users play 3 games a day, and then charge $2.50 - $5.00 per month if you want to play more. They \"lose\" money on the free users but gain community.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're building this primarily for yourself and you just want to share, this is pretty common - enabling others to benefit from your work if they want to go through the trouble of getting it set up, at no cost to you. So if you just want to share and not create a business, then this is fine.",

That's a cool thing to do, but it's not entirely practical in most cases.\n\nMost open source software's purpose isn't to let every user build their own copy (though that's possible to do), but to let other users go over your code and help fix errors and vulnerabilities, as well as keep the project going, because if you don't maintain the project someone will copy it and create a fork.\n\nQuick edit: I mention this because it might be possible for you to split the cost among your users. 1 business key is most likely much cheaper than 1000 single user keys - single user keys might be free for that API for now, but if it becomes popular that might not stay that way.",

These people will also not only just know the languages/tech that you mentioned, but they would also know computer science fundamentals like data structures, algorithms, OOP, etc. Obviously, most new grads are not experts in these things, but I’m just giving an idea of what you’d probably be up against. Related to that, you would have to learn leetcode, which is most of the time, not extremely relevant to the job/position, but usually required to pass an interview.\n\nYes you can learn all of those things yourself, but to add onto the issue of no degree, a lot of ATS résumé scanners used to look for candidates will immediately filter out people without degrees.\n\nSo, most people will suggest that you get a degree if you are serious about getting a developer or adjacent position. Not only would you learn important computer science concepts, but it is a good chance for networking and will help you to land a job.\n\nObviously, this is not guaranteed advice, as now, even  new grads with internship experience are struggling to find jobs. Yes, you can get a job while self learning, but it is extremely difficult. So if you are serious about this, I would at least consider the idea of going to school, or try self learning first and see if this is something you want to pursue even.",

You can do this over and over until they're small enough. That'll give you a kind of plan.\n\nFocusing on this skill first will let you realise you can split things into pieces and then do them in whichever order you like.\n\nThis is a skill that's totally useful for all programming tasks.\n\nThe second thing to learn is \"make skeletons\" or scaffolds — that's to say make it real as soon as possible. The way I do this is I get the minimum viable thing that can do **anything** in place first. When we first learn programming we learn how to do hello world because it's this; the minimum working program.\n\nFor your example, get a single hello web page up, served, online. Get that done. Ok. Now make it two pages that interlink, now make it slighly pretty, now add some graphics, now another page, etc etc. All the while your **big** aim is to build your finished website you have a plan of, but at each step of the way you're making it real, you're getting a serotonin hit from finishing tasks and you're feeling good because you're building things in reality, without doing too much at once, and this lets you get feedback early, too (from both yourself and other people). As you proceed, you may feel the pull to go down rabbit holes and add features, but you should really just add the features to your future list, and possibly change yours plans if it makes sense, and pick the next thing to do based on priorities of getting your project done according to your aims.\n\nAt any time you're free to tear it all down and start again, but this prototyping style of development is extremely useful in **any** kind of development (not just software), and will serve you well for the entire time you develop software of any kind. Get good at these two things, and then when a really big project comes along, you'll be equipped to tackle it by doing a bunch of little prototype experiments on the things you don't know how to do to prove to yourself you can do them, then break the project into pieces and build it bit by bit getting feedback along the way. (\"Agile\" development is really nothing more than keeping the list of next things to do prioritised on your end goal, and allowing for the fact that time is limited and you **may** actually never finish all the features because you run out of time).\n\nThere are other recommendations, but these are the two most important, in my opinion.",

I like the struggle (masochist >,>)\" This is the best attitude you can have. As long as you're enjoying the process of learning, it's just a matter of putting in the hours, hands on keyboard. So, don't stress too much about things, keep having fun.\n\nSecond piece of advice: It's really useful to have a concrete goal in mind. It sounds like you have this right now, but are getting pulled in a few directions by wanting to learn everything, that's okay. I have this issue when I'm working or learning, I'll get these great ideas for new features, projects, things to learn, etc. It's really easy to get sidetracked by them, since a lot of them are genuinely good ideas. My approach is when I'm working on a project, I keep 3 separate todo lists:\n\n1. What are the next steps for my project *right now*. These are things I *need* to get to in the next 1-3 days working on this project. If I am working on a feature and think \"Oooh, I can't forget to update this other thing or it will all break\" I write that down in this list. \n\n2. A list of future features for this project that might be fun to work on later. This could be something like \"Ahh, I want to redesign this component, maybe next week\".\n\n3. A list of other projects I want to work on, or things I want to learn. If I see a cool programming book. Or I have an idea for a cool new website to build. I'll write it down in this list.\n\nBy keeping these three lists, it really helps me avoid going down too deep into rabbit holes. I have a great idea, but instead of getting sidetracked for hours, days, weeks following it, I take a minute or two to get it into the appropriate list. \n\nAlso, lists #1 and #2 make it much easier to jump back into whatever I was last working on the next time I sit down to work on the project. For that reason, I try to keep a list #1 and #2 for each project I have, and I store them in the project itself, so they're always nearby.\n\nHope that's useful!",

Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, didn’t start out with C++, of course. He also says in interviews that every programmer would benefit from learning a handful of languages. Find some pods with Bjarne Stroustrup!\n\nMister C++ himself perhaps wouldn’t agree with this, but much of the best books on programming basics use Lisps as a vehicle. This way, they can focus on the programming itself, rather than forcing complex syntax on the reader.\n\nOne good example is “The Little Schemer” by Friedman & Felleisen. If you choose that one, I’ll spoil one thing: The “rules” and ”commandments” presented in the book are just rules within the book, meant to be applied when solving the exercises; they are generally not rules of the Scheme lang. This could be a bit confusing, if you haven’t understood it. Another thing: if you don’t solve a problem now, you maybe solve it next time. This is a simple, little book, that kind of escalates sneakily. You can read it over and over again till you get everything.",

Sure you could read books and do your own projects but will you?  Most people will not go nearly as in depth because we tend to be lazy and disorganized.  Our bootcamp enforced attendance and had weekly challenges which were difficult enough to require several hours of time outside the class activities.\n\nSecond our challenges and course material was carefully selected to reflect current industry demands.  If you are watching YouTube videos you will likely get sucked into a small niche of data analytics rather than learning the general concepts.  This paired with instructional staff who gave feedback, showed issues and helped refine your knowledge, lead to a good base.\n\nBut aside from this the students who did well and actually got positions, which were more than I expected, were ones who continued polishing and building a portfolio.  We got them running but the finish line often requires continued education.  But you do build momentum and result in several potential portfolio projects so it is better.\n\nTLDR:  Bootcamps provide structure and accountability that self learning rarely provides unless you are very organized and driven - but students often still needed to continue working on and polishing their portfolio to get their foot in the door.",

I also have terminal ADHD.\n\nI firmly believe that almost anyone, including those of us with ADHD, can learn almost anything with the right resources and learning strategies. Those resources aren't guaranteed to be available to you, and you aren't guaranteed to find the right learning strategy if you go looking, but there is a very good chance that you are capable of this.\n\nRandom notes in no particular order from what you've said:\n\n* You're \"supposed\" to learn TypeScript, Rust, JavaScript, Python, React? Why? It is far more valuable to be a good dev in one tech stack than a novice in 10. I strongly suggest picking one set of technologies that you feel suits your purposes and sticking with that. Jumping languages and frameworks every 5 seconds is exhausting and doesn't really teach you anything useful in my experience. It's also much easier for a good Python dev to become a good C# dev than it is for a polyglot novice to become good at any language, IMO.\n* Find a practice/learning style which suits you so that the endless learning doesn't become too much of a chore. For me, implementation is everything. I don't often \"get\" things unless I practice them myself, so if for example I'm learning some new data structure I'll usually hand-code an implementation of it rather than importing someone else's and prove to myself first that it works as I expect, and second that I've gathered enough information to create it. I also use this with programming for other things - my mind is a sieve when it comes to calculus, for example, but writing programs that *do* calculus really helps me crystalise the knowledge.\n* Respect the ADHD. A lot of people aren't going to get it and will give you advice that amounts to \"just keep trying\". Ignore them. I strongly believe that banging your head against a wall or burning yourself out trying to force your mind to act neurotypical is a net negative for learning. If you find yourself struggling for more than, say, 15 minutes on a problem you're quite possibly reinforcing the struggle rather than the progress. Learn when to be gentle with yourself, when to give up and look up the answers. There is such thing as trying too hard.\n* Drink water, sleep, exercise, socialise, rest and relax! Too many junior devs treat their health like shit and then are surprised when they feel like shit. Your concentration and working memory are already compromised by a neurological condition - don't make it worse.\n\nI think I've rambled long enough - please feel free to ask any questions you might have.",

Any other arbitrary assignment sounds even less intuitive.\n\nTake a look at one of the earliest encodings, [ASCII](https://www.asciitable.com/).  You'll find the first 32 values are all internal flags of some sort.  Some of those values helped with porting from prior system's encoding.\n\nThe ASCII table is actually pretty clever.  The 'A' at 41 and 'a' at 61 allow for upper and lower case conversion and testing to be simple bit operations.  There's a few more hidden gems in there.\n\nIt all comes down to bits.  Placement allows for certain operations to be done more efficiently.  Very low values have more value as symbols than something human readable.",

Computers are not capable of storing anything but integer values, which is why we devise so many various encoding schemes for things that aren't integers.\n\nAnd the answer it is more useful not to when treating them as string/character values, and not really all that useful when parsing a string into a numeric type. First, the idea only properly works for integers. Second, it only really works in a useful way for single digits. You need a minimum of 4 bits to count to 9 (`b1001`) and then quite a bit more for letters and punctuation. Even if we eliminate all of the control characters and limit ourselves to printable characters included in ASCII encoding, you still need at least 7 bits to cover those 95 characters with values from 0 (`b0000000`) to 94 (`b1011110`). We haven't even saved a single bit eliminating those (generally) unnecessary codes, but there aren't a lot of machines using 7-bit addressing these days, so let's assume the smallest numeric type you could use for encoding is probably 8 bits anyway. So to store the value 255 you would need 3 bytes. What's the super easy conversion to go from `b00000010-b00000101-b00000101` to `b11111111`? There isn't one really. You could argue that the conversion is still slightly simpler, but it isn't really significantly so, and it's hardly worth losing the benefits such as simpler and more performant sorting for characters.",

And the time taken to traverse the filesystem and open the file is even tinier. (Profiling will tell you just how tiny.)\n\nAnd as a counterpoint, whenever you go from having a single source of truth (e.g. the filesystem) to multiple separate data stores (the filesystem + a separate database), you increase the number of opportunities for complexity and bugs to creep into your system.\n\nFor *interactive* use, it might well be desirable to maintain a DB with metadata and indexes, so that you can quickly search for individual files. But for a big batch reprocessing job which is going to be slow anyway, I think it makes sense to just treat what's in the filesystem as authoritative, instead of relying on a DB that might potentially become out of sync if there's a bug. The difference in performance is likely to be small.\n\nIf the performance does actually matter (e.g. because you want to re-run your reprocessing job frequently) then what I would probably do is just maintain an index of paths/timestamps/checksums which are known to be \"good\" (don't need re-encoding). This allows you to avoid repeatedly scanning files that haven't changed. But the index itself contains no important data. If it gets lost, or stale, or corrupted, it's extremely unlikely to cause any kind of inconsistency or bad behavior; the worst that will happen is redoing unnecessary work.",

Others run on the client side using JavaScript, by dynamically assembling the page using DOM elements.\n\nAs a very simple example, if all of the pieces you want to use are static content, you can use a web server that supports [Server Side Includes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes). This technology isn't used much nowadays, but it's relatively easy to understand.\n\nIf you're writing a custom webapp backend, then you can use any server-side templating engine that you want. A template engine can allow one HTML fragment to include others, and it can also allow more dynamic substitutions. Many beginners use Python along with the lightweight Flask web framework, which uses the Jinja template engine.\n\nIf you're dedicated to using Java, you can use servlets and JSP pages (kind of old school) or you can go with a more modern framework like Spring, which supports a variety of template engines.\n\nIf you want to use client-side rendering with JavaScript, you once again have lots of options: React, Angular, Svelte, Vue, ...",

This way you can learn how build systems work under the hood and get into makefiles and also expose yourself to valgrind (this is essential if you want to learn and do your due diligence in the craft.)\n\nAlso, it would be helpful to learn some C if you haven't already. I recommend c99 for simplicity unless you want to see what threading is all about, then go with c11 or newer. Furthermore, have a very in-depth understanding of how compiled languages differ from interpreted languages (static vs. dynamic languages, respectively)\n\nI could go at length, and for some context, I typically point to prerequisites before the actual topic one wants to study. The foundations are too important to ignore, imo",

One of the best ways to keep motivation in my opinion is building something that solves a problem you have, because the drive to solve a problem is what makes programming so insanely addictive and fun. Solving a problem you have is the most rewarding and motivational thing I've ever experienced programming. So, try it out, don't wait for motivation just think of something that annoys you and build a solution. For example, I didn't like having to go to so many different sites to compress and convert different file formats so I made my own website that converts and compresses audios, videos and images in one simple place and that is one of my favorite projects because it really showed me that motivation doesn't come from waiting around or watching courses, but from solving problems, coming up with something to make and making it.\n\nStay consistent by practicing and by making mistakes, keep yourself in that loop of frustrated about why your code isn't running but then you figure it out and you're really happy, that loop of dopamine will make learning fun and addictive for you. And when learning and problem solving becomes addictive that's when you start building the software you dream of building, because you start to realize that nothing is too difficult you just have to put in more work.",

Than this other game they didn't develop where they didn't have that loading screen constraint? How can you compare the two? How can anyone not in bad faith be affirmative that the current game is better than this other game they didn't develop without constraints?   \nI know you didn't come up with these examples, that they come from people looking for stuff to analyze and make content out of. But they are just bad generalizations.  \n\nIn any projects, you have constraints, and your goal is do the best thing possible despoite those constraints. And sometimes, being creative with those constraints helps a lot in doing that. but people don't intentionally self-inflict contraints when they want to do a product.  \n\nIt can however be a nice way to spark creativity or to develop one's skill by forcing oneself to do something differnetly than how they were doing it. I'm thinking of game jams (to stay in the realm of video games examples), where the goal is specifically to add two massive constraints (time and a custom directive) in order to force developers to be creative. The goal of these games is not to be products, even though some of them end up being great base ideas that later get expanded into full games.",

Perhaps if you are *very* used to learning this way, I know fully blind programmers. \n\nIt’s not just the seeing, it’s the doing.

Imagine trying to learn to play baseball purely by listening - or learning to play the guitar purely by listening.\n\nIt's fine for an hour or two of introductory material - but once you get beyond that, any strategy or advanced knowledge you might be taught wouldn't make any sense if you haven't had a chance to practice.\n\nIf you want to listen to something programming-related, how about Neal Stephenson audiobooks? Snow Crash, Diamond Age and Cryptonomicon have some of the best descriptions I've seen of programming in fiction.

From there, you need to understand programming isn't just \"learning a language\", but its a skill of problem solving. To practice that problem solving skill you can try and build some small projects or do coding challenges. For simple challenges, check out [Exercism's C++ track](https://exercism.org/tracks/cpp/), a bunch of simple coding challenges to help tease your brain and develop the problem solving skill. Exercism also has a mentoring service if you get stuck on some problems, don't be afraid to use it. After that, I would tackle some projects of sorts. You could use something like [Code academy's guided C++ projects](https://www.codecademy.com/projects/language/c-plus-plus) as an example or even jump straight into unity as you should have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of C++ and programming generally.\n\nSo this is just an example, but in short\n\n1. Programming fundamentals through [learncpp.com](http://learncpp.com)\n2. Solve coding challenges and get help from mentors on [exercism.org](http://exercism.org)\n3. Do some projects with code academy or unity directly.\n\nRemember to take your time. This is a lifelong endeavor, don't get frustrated if you get stuck. Just try to code a little bit every day and you will really absorb and understand. Give yourself a year, just code everyday and you will be OK.",

If you’re curious about how computers actually work under the hood, memory, CPU, OS, hardware interactions, then absolutely go for it. It gives you a strong foundation that makes you a better developer overall. Languages like C, C++, or Rust teach you to think about efficiency, optimization, and resource management in ways high-level languages hide.\n\nThat said, it’s not always beginner-friendly. Debugging and memory management can be frustrating at first. If your goal is app or web dev, you might not need to dive deep right away. But if you’re into systems, embedded, cybersecurity, or game engines, learning low-level programming is 100% worth it. It’s harder, but it pays off in skill and understanding.",

I understood the concepts and how they apply to real-world problems, but never actually built anything.\n\nIt's not the course that is to blame here. It is, like every single time, *you*, the learner. If you felt you are only solving exercise after exercise, you could and should have sought out mini projects to build. The *Frequently Asked Questions* right here in the *sidebar* have more than plenty project ideas.\n\nYou can't expect to get everything spoon fed. *You* have to take the initiative to do things, to learn, not wait for the stuff to be given to you.\n\nWhen I learnt programming in the early 1980s, tutorials simply did not exist. There was no internet, there were barely any knowledgeable people in my (rural) area, and still I learnt programming on my own and was already a competent programmer when I later did my degree. How? Through active programming. Through *trying*, through *experimenting*, through *building things* out of my own imagination.\n\nYou have the entire internet with its near infinite resources and knowledge at your fingertips, but no incentive to improve yourself, which your stopping the course clearly indicates. The same will happen with every single course you take.\n\nYou just want to eat the cake, but not muster the energy and take the effort to learn to bake it.",

Like, people are still arguing over what this term means to this day, and they refuse to agree on a concrete definition.\n\nTypically though, OOP is, unsurprisingly centered around the idea of \"objects\"; encapsulated bundles of data, and methods that can interact with a given instance of said data. Under an OOP framework, a program is simply various interactions between different component objects.\n\nIn a Tamagotchi, you have a 'pet', that gets fed 'food' that you buy from the 'store', and keep in your 'inventory' until needed. The 'pet' can have different 'states' that effect its behaviour - states like \"hungry\", \"happy\" or \"dead\". All of these are displayed to the user of the game by a 'game window', and specific information can be managed by a 'settings manager'. You get the gist.\n\nMany people argue that OOP has proverbial 'pillars'; \"encapsulation\" (keeping related fields and methods bundled together in classes), \"inheritance\" (objects can inherit behaviour of other objects), and \"polymorphism\" (use an interface, dummy), but that's another question, and whether some of them matter enough is again, in contention.",

And for both, what will realistically happen when you start doing these NOW? Right now when you start doing competitive programming, what will happen? You'll be last in the rankings? But will you gain absolutely nothing from it? No new experience, no new knowledge, no new skills? What will happen when you join the next upcoming hackathon? Realistically, what will happen?

You sit in lectures -> try to do something practical after that and use that new knowledge. You learn a new technology -> start using that new technology.

Free AI tools are there. It takes just few Youtube videos to see how to use one or another tool. You can allocate one weekend on learning to use an AI and already you'll know more and you'll be more experienced than prior to that weekend.\n\nHopelessness will not change anything.

        "body": "Oh brother, lets break this down, and I'm going to explain this in a high level, so I don't have any Java-specific tips to give. Maybe just general ones.\n\nSo in this 2 weeks, you would have to create:\n- mechanics (movement, AI/automatons, pass/fail conditions, etc.)\n- look (UI, aesthetics, animations, etc.)\n- other utils that can be optional (save/load system, settings system, the extra stuff that can help with accessibility)\n\nThere can be more things here and there depending on complexity, but as a bare minimum, you would make all of these and combine them all together.\n\nYou're now probably thinking \"oh boi this is a lot of work\" and I don't know how many you are in the team, so my first suggestion is to make it as simple as possible, and only add features if it's possible within the timeframe. Don't try to make too much features that just ends up delaying the release. We call that \"feature creep\". Write a TODO list and gauge the complexity of certain features or aspects so that your team can prioritize on ones that are critical. Don't try to deliver a car without an engine. That's what happened to my team in my game development course in university and we used Unity3D, which has less boilerplate setup than Java Swing (or at least, we don't code the UI from scratch), and we're given a longer time to make the game. Feature creep fucked us over.\n\nNext suggestion is learning git and GitHub. Host your project there, and you all can collaborate wherever you are and you can revert changes if stuff did not work right. Creating branches is useful so that everyone's works can be isolated. And you can do peer reviews. This helps with code quality and engages collaboration with each other.\n\nLast suggestion: always test. If possible, reserve a few days for playtesting and bugfixing after playtest. That's why we have alpha and beta tests. Alpha test is your whole team testing the game, and beta test is other people playing your game. This will give you a fresh perspective on people interacting with your game. Like as simple as a certain hitbox not working right. Or a critical bug that can happen when conditions are met that your whole team has not encountered in your internal playtesting.\n\nAnd that's it from me. I'm not a professional game developer by any means, and I'm not specialized in Java Swing or Java in general (although it's my main programming language), but my game development course and my current job gave me a lot of insight and workflows on how to tackle potentially large projects like these. And I've realized that the difficulty is not necessarily on the programming, but planning and managing the project altogether. So I guess the first step now is to setup all the things. GitHub, the initial Java project and needed external libraries. Then plan it all out, so that you can assign tasks to yourselves. Feel free to chat in DM. Just don't show weird sht or send a virus that destroys my PC.\n\nOh right before I forget that this post exists, my other advice is to not make AI do your work. Sometimes, they're just doing random sht. Other times, it collides with something. AI relies on your foundation code to become a good asset (which can still screw up, but it may screw up less). So assuming you are allowed to use AI coding agents (because this question will come up at some point), always verify what it types out. Again, this is where peer reviews come into play. Either do it in school or via GitHub PRs.\n\nAnd NEVER EVER USE GENERATIVE AI FOR ANY CREATIVE ASSETS LIKE ART OR MUSIC. We have free assets to use on the Internet if you have to. Making any form of artistic work via Generative AI is a middle finger to artists that have spent hours and hours on making artworks that people appreciate, enjoy, or even connect with.",

The main purpose of technology is to **improve the way we do something**, either with a tool or otherwise. Instead of calculating numbers by hand, we use a calculator to automate the process. Instead of converting a lot of numbers using a calculator, we use a spreadsheet program to do it in bulk. A lot of the constructs of programming serve the same purpose.\n\nAt its very basic, most programs can be written with if-conditions and variables alone. However, we don't do that, and we use lists, loops, functions and classes instead, **not** because we have to (exceptions apply), but because we want to. Most of them serve the same purpose: **to shorten and simplify code at the cost of more complex and intricate logic**.\n\nFor example, instead of writing:\n\n    cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;\n    cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;\n    cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;\n    cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;\n    cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;\n\nYou can instead write:\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        cout << \"Hello World\" << endl;\n    }\n\nClasses serve a similar purpose: instead of having loose, disconnected variables and functions all over the place, you \"group\" them into objects. This gives you many benefits, making it much simpler to code certain algorithms, keeping your code organized so that you don't confuse yourself and others as your code base expands, and in some languages, it provides a layer of \"code safety\" as well.\n\nBut to emphasize, you do **not** have to necessarily write code this way, in most cases. A lot of different syntax \"oddities\" exist to be **shortcuts**, such as how `i++` is mostly just `i = i + 1`. The same is true of a while-loop versus a for-loop, the former of which is more fundamental. \n\nThis is why it seems there are so many solutions to the same problem, but they all do the same thing in varying levels of efficiency, in terms of logic and/or syntax.",

In practice, all platforms I've seen would support `-2**31` as well. \n\nI.e. the values -2147483648 up to and including 2147483647 should fit in a 32-bit signed integer. But the C Standard (at least all C Standards before C23) only requires platforms to support from -2147483647 to 2147483647 in order to accomodate storing the integer in non 2's complement form. However it seems that C23 requires 2's complement, so maybe that is different in C23. In practice, though, all platforms you're likely to use are using 2's complement. \n\nHowever, 1L << 31 results in 2147483648, a value that does not fit in a 32-bit signed integer, so you are invoking integer overflow (which is formally undefined behaviour, but since you're doing at \"at compile time\" maybe it's really implementation defined). \n\nIn any case, we surely can't expect that the result will be the same in this case between platforms (32-bit long vs. 64-bit long).\n\nIf you want the same behaviour, you should suffix ul on your integer constant (some people prefer writing uL or UL for readability). That way, you'll be working with 32-bit unsigned long vs. 64-bit unsigned long. The sizes are different but since you're still within the 32-bit unsigned range in your example, you'll get the same behaviour in this case. Since 1ul << 31 is unsigned long, you should also update the printf format from %ld to %lu to ensure the correct integer interpretation when printing it out.",

Literals are implicitly cast to the assigned type because this pedantic redundancy is a wholly unnecessary distraction that has no benefit in any sense of the word.\n\nSo I've played with it, and wrote the variations:\n\n    int x = 5;\n    int x = 5L;\n    int x = 5LL;\n    int x = 5ULL;\n\nAnd I compiled them under GCC for ARM and x86_64.

The type is determined by the type declaration of the variable being assigned, and the literal is implicitly converted at compile-time.\n\nNow as for your code:\n\n    printf(\"%zu %ld\", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);\n\nYeah, the type is deduced from the literal itself, so of course you're going to get a non-portable result.\n\n---\n\nI think it's important to understand how to use primitive types.\n\nC defines a whole family of type aliases. They are guaranteed to alias the built-in types. First are the fixed width types:\n\n    int8_t\n\nEtc. The fixed width types ARE NOT guaranteed to be defined in the first place - they are only defined on platforms that actually have native hardware support for those exact widths. If there is no 16 bit type support on that hardware, there is no `int16_t`. This comes up on DSPs and ASICs the most, though you'll also see it on FPGAs, in some old or really tiny embedded architectures, like old 4-bit machines, or some exotic or esoteric hardware few have ever heard of.\n\nThe fixed width types are for implementing protocols. These could be file formats, hardware interfaces, or network/transport protocols. You will use these for defining types that are going to be serialized or mapped to hardware. You'll use these in data buffers.\n\nThen there are the `least` types:\n\n    uint_least32_t\n\nEtc. These types are the smallest widths available with at least as many bits, and these types are ALWAYS defined. For platforms that support fixed width types, they're 1:1. They may contain more bits, but you cannot portably rely on that, nor should you, because that defeats the point.\n\nUse these types in your in-memory data structures to maximize system and cache memory density and bus transfer efficiency.\n\nContinued...",

These are the most computationally efficient use of hardware registers on your platform with at least as many bits. Very often these will be larger than the bit size specified. Registers tend to be laid out in powers of two word sizes - word, double word, quad word... And so will these. Ideally, what you'll get is these values will be optimized and either never see cache or system memory - your code should be small enough that they exist only in registers - for sufficiently large hardware platforms.\n\nC has a weak type system, because C is a negotiation between the standard, the hardware, and you. This flexibility inherent to the primitive types is also a form of portability in its own right. This is how you can port Unix from one architecture to another, because you write code in terms of `int`, and you get whatever size and extent that hardware can handle, whatever hardware you go to. You get internal consistency. It's when you start working with external data that you need to accommodate data protocols and their data.\n\nMost of the time you don't need fixed width types - and it's actually not desirable for computation. They're either too big for memory, or too small for registers. Besides - if you're not defining a protocol, who cares how many bits you have exactly? All you care about is that you have enough - which is something you need to figure out at design time. What are you doing? How many bits do you need? Once you know, you want the fewest to store in memory, and then you don't care how many are used for actual computation, so long as it's fast and efficient.\n\nSo the `least` and `fast` end up being the types you use the most. They're completely inappropriate and not portable for protocols, and you want to get away from the fixed width types as soon as possible - at the fringes, where IO happens.\n\nSo this code:\n\n    printf(\"%zu %ld\", sizeof(1L), 1L << 31);\n\nIt's completely asinine. You're not outputting the size and extent of a type, but of a value, and the type of the value is up to the compiler's discretion - the implementation just PICKED SOMETHING, because it doesn't matter; in all other code, this would be narrowed or widened implicitly and correctly. This is fine for writing debug, but as you're writing to the `stdout` file descriptor and presuming you were trying to do something REAL, you'd be wanting to write in terms of a protocol, which means the correct thing to do is write this in terms of a fixed width type to make it portable.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing is about the C type system - an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. You are not expected to use the primitive types directly - you're expected to make your own types in terms of primitives, and then describe your solution in terms of that. If you didn't care what the type was - then you'd write your implementation as a macro, and practice the Generic Programming paradigm.\n\nYour `int` is always something more specific, a quantity, a range, a unit of something. Make your types and control your semantics. An `int` can perform all arithmetic and bitwise operations, but a `weight` can only add to other `weight`s, and can only multiply against scalars. A `weight` can't be negative. So:\n\n    typedef struct weight weight;\n\n    weight *create(int_least32_t);\n    weight *dup(const weight *);\n    weight *copy(weight *, const weight *);\n    void destroy(weight *);\n    weight *add(weight *, const weight *);\n    weight *multiply(weight *, int);\n    int_least32_t weight_to_int(const weight *);\n    int print(const weight *);\n\nNotice it's an opaque pointer. `print` returns an `int` because `printf` returns an `int`. `multiply` accepts an `int` because its an arbitrary value - unless in your design you know something better. An `int` is going to be the native word size, so efficient. Then you implement:\n\n    struct weight {\n      int_least32_t value;\n    };\n\n    weight *create(const int_least32_t value) {\n      weight *w = NULL;\n\n      if(value >= 0) {\n        weight *w = (weight *)malloc(sizeof(weight));\n        w.value = value;\n      }\n\n      return w;\n    }\n\n    //...\n\n    weight *add(weight *res, const weight *w) {\n      if(res && w) {\n        res.value += w.value;\n\n        return res;\n      }\n\n      return NULL;\n    }\n\n    weight *multiply(weight *res, const int v) {\n      if(res && v >= 0) {\n        res.value *= v;\n\n        return res;\n      }\n\n      return NULL;\n    }",

This may be why the Standard says you are only allowed to left-shift up to 31 bits for a 32-bit unsigned type. If the type of unsigned long is a 32-bit type on a particular platform (e.g. ARM), then indeed shifting it left by 48 is undefined behaviour.\n\nMore on this can be found discussed here: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784996/why-does-left-shift-operation-invoke-undefined-behaviour-when-the-left-side-oper)\n\nAlso, I'm not really sure you can avoid implicit integer promotion in a single expression like 1ul << 48. Even if you write UINT32_C(1) as suggested in the other reply on the thread, the type produced by that expression is actually uint_least32_t (i.e. it could be 32-bit or it could be bigger).\n\nSo in my view, an expression like 1ul << 48 is just not portable. I would hope that my compiler would give me a warning if I were compiling that code on a platform where unsigned long is 32-bit, but it's conceivable that on other platforms (where unsigned long is 64-bit), that it would compile with no warning but still be non-portable, as you seem to have discovered.\n\nIf you're really in a bind and need to do something like the above in a portable way, you could consider computing it at runtime. Though in this case it seems a bit like a waste of time, since it seems like we want the final value 0 in this case:\n\n    uint64_t tmp = 1ul;  \n    tmp <<= 48;  \n    uint32_t value = (uint32_t)tmp;  \n    printf(\"%zu\\n\", sizeof(value));  \n    printf(\"%lu\\n\", value);\n\nThis should give the same result regardless of what size long's are on the platform. And the result should be 0 on all platforms that support uint32_t (for all possible starting values of value), since vacated bits get filled in with 0 -- unless I'm misunderstanding something that could happen differently on some platform (seems unlikely though).",

That would be your *Web 2.0* milestone.\n\nOnly after that I would suggest moving to *Java* and trying to repeat *Web 1.0* and *Web 2.0* milestones. Java and Spring do a lot of things about overall project structure, architecture, testability, etc. And if you jump straight into it you will be overwhelmed. Node will help you see quickly how different bits fit together and this will help with covering basics of language-independent web stack.",

Good to be defensive when dealing with user input and to assume the user will break it, so check the index input for 1) being a number and 2) actually being an accessible index of the list in question before accessing it, and maybe if it's not, tell the user that the input was invalid. As it is now, you do catch it, but it also ends the program. Maybe it doesn't need to end the program!",

Alternatively, you can go into subreddits and discords for the language you are using. \n\nThere are some objective measures you can do. You could benchmark your engine with a known example scene, and see how much memory, FPS, TPS (ticks per second, FPS but for physics), etc. it uses. You can see if it crashes, how good the error messages are, and how well documented it is. \n\nHow clean your code is, is another subjective measure.

In my case, computer sciences was my passion and my hobby and I eventually went for a degree in it and started working as a software developer. If your passion is art, then yeah, artists are not making much, as I have heard. \n\nDo not pick software development just because of its salary. When I did my university studies I saw people picking computer sciences for all the wrong reasons: salary, a friend recommended, a mother wanted, a wish to escape an army service (it is compulsory here), etc. And they dropped out. I saw students burning out, being depressed, etc. because they realized they picked a wrong field. Do you need the same?\n\nPick software development when you have an interest towards it. When you are good problem solver. When you have a mathematical mind. Because software development is all about analyzing different real life problems, coming up with ideas for solutions to these problems, and then implementing and delivering these solutions. If you are not a creative person, if you are unable to figure out solutions to random problems, if you are not interested in sitting behind a computer for 8 hours a day, then this field is not for you.\n\nThe next step, pick a field that is in demand in place where you plan to start working. And for time being, that place will be Sudan. You are less likely to find a remote job as a beginner or even as a Junior software developer. Which means, you should set your current goal to find a job in your local market. Check job offers in cities around you. From there you can find the technologies and job positions that are in demand. \n\nFor example you can be interested in blockchains, and it is a valid interest, but when there are exactly ZERO jobs for it, then should you pick it as your main specialty? You can pick it as a side hobby then, but not as something you will be doing for a job.\n\nAnd about machine learning, AI, web development (frontend, backend, full stack), applied cryptography, cyber security, etc. What about trying out these things? The same way how you'd try these out while doing your Bachelor studies in Computer Sciences and having these introduced to you during your courses. When I did my degree studies I learnt some embedded programming, web application development, telecom technologies, system administration, cyber security, different maths, etc. Did I specialize in all of these? No. I specialized in web application development (mainly backend) and in cyber security (did Master studies in it). \n\nIf you are considering becoming a web application developer then better go for full stack. Which stack? Depends on your local job market. In some places they want PHP developers. Where I live they want Java developers. Pick the technology based on job offers. And the same goes for choosing the front end framework. May it be React, Angular, Vue or something else. Also, then you have to learn some web application security and also some DevOps (enough to deal with Docker, setting up Kafka or some message queuing tool, working with logs, setting up CI/CD pipeline, and perhaps even trying out Kubernetes). Because writing code is not enough. What if your stuff gets hacked? What if the application stops working when 100 people start using it? You have to consider real life scenarios.",

You don't *have* to use BP for keeping track of the current function's stack frame; that's just what C compilers typically do.\n\nThe only stack instruction that changes the contents of the BP register is POP BP.\n\nC typically sets up stack frames based on BP like this.  The assembly code for a C function called `myfunc` probably looks like this, regardless of what `myfunc` actually does:\n\n    myfunc:\n        PUSH BP\n        MOV BP,SP\n        ; ... function goes here ...\n        POP BP\n        RET\n\nBut again, that's just what C compilers [1] do.  Your own assembly programs don't have to do things this way; you could use BP to hold a number used in a calculation instead.\n\nThat being said, there are several reasons to set up a stack frame the same way a C compiler would:\n\n- It's a standard practice that makes your code easier to understand\n- BP can index the stack without a segment prefix override [2]\n- You must index the stack to access arguments from high-level languages\n- You can use stack as a convenient way to quickly allocate memory in your function (this is how high-level languages allocate memory for local variables if you have too many to fit in registers)\n\nI agree with another poster's recommendation to figure out a way to get assembly listings produced by a compiler.  For all the popular modern C compilers, [Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/) is an easy way to do this, but it only seems to support 32-bit or 64-bit x86 targets.  (The most visible difference between 16-bit assembly is 32-bit register names start with E, for example ECX; and 64-bit register names start with R, for example RCX.)\n\n[1] Different programming languages use different calling conventions, especially in the previous millenium.  Meaning the arguments might be laid out in a different order, or there might be some extra information.  For example if you're interfacing with, say, the QBASIC programming language instead of C, you will need a FAR return (to a different segment) that pops the caller's arguments off the stack, [like this](http://www.petesqbsite.com/sections/tutorials/tuts/doorknob/asm_appendix1.html), and the arguments are also passed in reverse order compared to C.\n\n[2] Segments are important for 16-bit assembly, which I assume you're working with as you say \"BP\" (16-bit) not \"EBP\" (32-bit) or \"RBP\" (64-bit).  But segments aren't relevant to 32-bit or 64-bit programs; the popular modern OS's all use flat memory models, and manage memory with paging rather than segments.",

Hoentsly it was more like 20 hours and chilled for the rest of the week.\n\nFAANG, was more like what you describe. \n\nAnd my current big tech, closer to 40 but it's not stressful. \n\nManagement will tell you to not go over but im willing to bet there's a \"wink-wink\" to do it.

In fact unless you're the rare 1%, you probably should be putting up less PR's as a staff, senior, etc. then you do as a junior.\n\nThat's because your job becomes more and more about improving the quality and speed of the devs around you. Devs on your team should be moving tickets faster with you there.\n\nThe reward becomes harder to see and it's not for everyone. You'll have less days logging off feeling great because you finally solved a problem that's blocking a release, but more quarters feeling good because you identified and shipped a solution that enabled 2+ projects to deliver quicker.

You need people who can guide other engineers, break down hard problems in a way that are tangible to less experienced engineers, and mostly when you’re building a piece of software, it’s rarely greenfield, but more about building a piece of the jigsaw puzzle in a larger ecosystem, so you need to talk to other people (who own the other neighbouring pieces of your jigsaw puzzle) to make sure you design the piece in a good way, and these skills are hard to come by, a combination of tech competence, understanding the system well enough to be able to decide the direction you want to take it in, is a harder skill than people understand. In reality it does sadly look a lot like jira tickets and docs/slides, but youre not becoming useless, unless you’re being passive, because you’re (somewhat) in a driving seat.",

The progression is natural, but you can carve your career a bit based on your own goals. If you want to maximize career growth, you have to align yourself with business goals and impact, and the way to do this is rarely to output more code but instead be a multiplier- train up other devs, lead initiatives, set up processes to streamline things. Part of this may in fact be figuring out ways to trim down meetings but still maintain same output and quality. This may mean you decline meetings that aren't useful.\n\nAlternatively you can also drive impact by being very technical and the expert on one technology. At my internship (circa 2017) Docker was still somewhat new and some guy named Sheldon learned about it at a meetup and introduced it to the company and he was the \"Docker guy\" who people would go to get help.\n\nOr you can choose to just focus on doing what you want to do and not min-max career development. My first job out of college was low 6 figures, and feasibly that was enough to never \"career develop\" again from financial aspect. If you are financially where you want to be, then no reason to let the corporation decide what you get out of your \\~8 hours a day you're giving to the company.",

Cite past failed deployments made by this DevOps as reasons for why to change the current system.\n\nRather than perform deployments, the DevOps team would create the tools or system that enable you to do deployments without direct access to the system.\n\nThe DevOps are frustrated because they have to deploy code they didn't write. I guarantee you, there are times when your deployment instructions or post-deploy verification steps are lacking, because no one is perfect. So rather than focus on which \"false bugs\" they filed, be a professional and ignore it. Come up with plans which prevent the DevOps from accidentally applying the wrong config file.

It does a lot of our trivial crap, for sure, just as DreamWeaver allowed us to sigh and get more work from fixing sites created in WYSIWGs editors (which honestly, has become my \"new normal\" of fixing AI slop bullshit from people who aren't FEEs; it grinds my gears, but whatever - I get a paycheck, and my team trusts that I know what I'm doing).\n\nBut it's not going to be able to handle complex code bases.

First of all, make sure to keep in touch with your network, especially the people you did great work with in the past. Not all stretches of your career will have you working with people you click with and on projects that succeed, but the stretches that do are where your real network comes from.\n\nSecond, make sure to study system design interviews. They've become performance theater at this point like LeetCode and you're expected to \"know the moves\" at some places. Most staff+ interviews also had a project presentation and Q&A part which paradoxically is the opposite where you're cooked if you never had the scope and scars but you don't need to study for. Also expect newer companies to ask more non-memorizable-from-internet coding and system design questions, which IMO is a great thing because that'll probably trickle to the rest of the industry eventually.\n\nThe above is for ICs who are still hands on.

GPT cannot answer that for them without it being obvious or very disjointed. \n\nTo assess technical expertise you let them tell you the stuff they think was hard or interesting. If they're left speechless then there's your answer. This should be mega easy for a senior engineer to do. Get them to use a screen sharing tool to make a quick box diagram of the architecture or components, how they relate. Prod them for all the minor details you can to make sure they aren't just bullshitting and have meaningful knowledge.\n\nLike yes, GPT messes up quiz questions about \"how do undefined and null differ in JavaScript\" (who gives a shit?) but it's not going to let them *convincingly* fake knowing about a whole system architecture or what makes it well designed.\n\nAnd frankly if they can use LLMs to properly solve challenging programming tasks then cool, that is itself a skill. Like at a certain point if someone is really good at \"cheating\" and constructing this whole interview hacking strategy then they're probably smart enough to do the real job lol.",

I've had to give them whiteboard problems....and I really don't think either are very useful. \n\n\nPeople study for those things in a way that they do not study for their job. And I do the same. \n\n\nBut I get it. It's an attempt to be objective. Still, I don't think it's really that useful. LLMs haven't really changed anything, IMHO.\n\n\nHere's what I really did, at least when I was still in the office.\n\n\nLet me talk to them. It can even be over lunch.  We just have a chat about their last project, or any project they want. It can be academic or professional. It can be a Pokemon fan site. I don't care. Preferably something they are passionate about, especially for the earlier career folk.\n\n\nLow stress. I'm not trying to trick you. Explain it to me. Let me ask some questions. There aren't even right or wrong answers. It's about communication, and clarity, and a depth of understanding. Use a napkin and draw something out if it helps. \n\n\nIf I'm doing it right, it should be the easiest interview they've ever had. It hardly feels like an interview... I'm just like a slightly overenthusiastic fan of their work. I'm trying to help them demonstrate all the awesome stuff they have done. \n\n\nIt's not a sales job. There isn't any benefit in them practicing to prepare. The questions I ask are all over the place and are specific to their project and their previous responses. I'm intentionally asking questions that will let them demonstrate a breadth and depth of knowledge. It's not a prepared slide deck they could practice with. The way to crush this interview is to fully understand the ins and outs of a sufficiently complex codebase, or at least, section of codebase, AND the languages, frameworks and tools they'd use. \n\n\nPracticing for my interview would be exactly like practicing for the job. And our conversation is basically the same as I would have with a coworker who wrote XYZ in our codebase, except, ya know, I'd be less interested and ask fewer questions, but it's really really close. \n\n\nI've personally watched people who aced our technical problem _because they had seen it before_ get hired and be mediocre. I've also lied about a candidate who failed his whiteboard session miserably because they were nervous, hadn't prepped and hardly communicated anything, but during our 'culture fit' spent 45 minutes convincing me that he was an experienced developer who didn't do well under pressure. He was a great hire. I'm old, and he's actually progressed further in his career than I have. \n\n\nMaybe I've just been lucky, but I've never had a decently long chat like this with someone and thought 'Wow, they really know their stuff' and been wrong.",

I've had this happen where they throw a 'gotcha' and all of a sudden you're in a different vertical than what you thought they were going to test you on. Big fat waste of time for everyone involved because you can't code something you're unprepared for within less than an hour window, even though you could do it within 3 hours and a bunch of Googling. If you're going to build a Wordle game, tell them before. If they're going to fetch data, manipulate data, filter data, and display a list, tell them beforehand. These are two very different things and you could be super sharp at one and not the other.\n\n\\- Live technical test with AI. The key here is to check whether or not they are blindly accepting prompts from AI. Take the time to ask questions around what the code they just accepted is doing and why they think that is a good solution.\n\n\\- Timed test (take home/alone). Give them a quite complicated technical test and 3-4 hours to complete it with a submission deadline. They will have to use AI to solve it in that time. Then you follow up in another meeting to discuss the solution and why they did what they did.\n\n\\- Take home test. Make it complicated as above. They will use AI but how do they handle state management? How do they fetch data? How do they handle errors? Is it scalable? Etc. You can ask for more if you're permitting AI.\n\nYou can effectively assess someone's ability even when they use AI. All you need to do is ask a bunch of questions around the solution to see if they know what they're doing. Overall, just remember that you're trying to hire someone, you're not trying to catch someone out who can't remember a certain method on the spot, that won't tell you anything other than your process is an act of gatekeeping. If you judged a fish on it's ability to climb tree's you'd believe it was stupid so ask yourself if you're setting your candidates up for success.",

You have to grasp that you are part of a team, and if you aren't a team player, it doesn't matter what merits you believe you have over another team member. You aren't the one handing out the raises and promotions. The leaders of the team decide what the team values. \n\nSo, if you don't like what the team values, that's fine. You can go find another team, but recognize that the game is the same. If you want to be valuable to the team, you have to show growth in ways that the team values, not just what you deem valuable. \n\nOn the other hand, if you can't do that, and feel strongly that you know what is valuable better than anyone else, that's the spirit that drives entrepreneurs. Your path to a good boss might be becoming your own, but you better be able to sell your authority as the guy who knows to clients, and understand what they find valuable.",

Also, with your yeo, you may have to consider entry/junior level positions at this point. Also look into doing contract work through recruiters.",

Maybe mid-level engineer from what I can tell. You might be able to even upsell as a senior engineer in some places pretty easily depending on your confidence and leadership ambitions. \n\nObviously the work you did won't be a tit-for-tat match with a backend engineer working on some Java WebLogic crap or something but at the end of the day what's more important is that you clearly have the background skills to build complex data pipelines.\n\nI'd say focus on selling your FAAS and AWS cloud skillset, those are pretty important in modern infra.   \n\n>How do I recover from being this rusty after months out of the field?  \n  \nWhat's the most efficient way to rebuild technical skills when you've been disconnected for this long, especially the deep technical knowledge that comes up in interviews?\n\nYou're probably not really all that rusty. Go do a few LCs and you'll be right back to golden most likely. The important thing to recognize is that if you've done it once, you can do it all again. \n\n>Is my experience even marketable in the current climate, or is \"data integration and ETL work\" too niche or not in-demand right now? \n\nI think anything is marketable with the right verbiage, personally. You could be a mainframe developer and as long as you demonstrate the ability to learn, manage complex systems, and build out feature services I think most places would be happy with it. \n\nAlso, ETL is probably still very much relevant in the modern age. It's not like data pipelines are suddenly agnostic and all-encompassing. I don't have the personal experience with the BIG data boys though, as my only experience with ETL was with a financial firm myself doing similar work as yours but I can't imagine the practice is somehow deprecated and forgotten to time already. \n\n>And for people who've been through extended unemployment periods where your skills got rusty - how did you get sharp again? What actually worked for rebuilding that technical depth?\n\nYou can't really build technical depth without working on some larger systems imo. So either build your own or work with what you've got. I built some side projects for fun back in the day that I never really took anywhere but just used to keep my cloud knowledge fresh and available. But realistically you can probably just get by with some refresher courses.",

I relearned some fundamentals using Udemy and started working on my Master's degree. I also picked up courses in System Design using [hellointerview.com](http://hellointerview.com) and educative.io. I use ChatGPT a lot to create study guides for myself when I interview at companies, I try to get a refresher on their tech stack so I can speak their language. I also started doing Leetcode religiously, completed Neetcode's 150 and have about 170 problems on Leetcode.com.  It's been a rough journey where I've been passing DSA interviews and System design interviews, but now companies are starting to ask on the job syntax questions to really filter down candidates. There's just too many of us, the market is overly saturated.  So now I'm on the grind, building apps from scratch and iterating on it over and over again until I have the syntax down to a T as well. We'll see how my next interviews go. I've had friends in the same boat and I had one friend that studied LC for 6 months straight to get into Meta, but ended up failing the System Design. The other thing is they're super picky about languages now, if you say you know Java, they want you to do their stupid LC in Java. As if knowing syntax is going to make you a good engineer....\n\nI've been unemployed for a year and still looking, so you're not alone.\n\nPeople that are employed will never understand what we're going through. In fact, they wouldn't even pass their own interviews today. I can guarantee you that I have more skill than any of them in any system design interview or leetcode question.  All they know is how to interview people and of course when you have all the answers in front of you it's easy to do that.\n\nStay strong my brother, I've also considered other roles that are closely related like Customer Support Engineer, DevOps, IT Support, and wait until the economy gets better. I've been applying to those roles and it's been a lot better since they don't ask ridiculous questions and demand regurgitation of syntax immediately. This industries has a lack of respect for senior engineers with the way they treat their engineers. I, too, might have to exit the field as well. I still really enjoy coding and building things, but it may have to do be something I do as a hobby for now instead of professionally.",

What I do with my career is really on me, and is based on my personal goals and priorities. It'd be odd if my tech lead sat me down and explained what he wants me to do after I quit the company we're at.\n\nBut technical-wise, I had a great tech lead at my new grad company. His mentorship style was kinda trial by fire. He'd expect you to first try things on your own, do your own research on the company wiki, etc. Then, he'd be there to fallback on when you got stuck. Notably he didn't spoonfeed answers to anybody, he'd help nudge you towards the right answer. If I didn't do a good job of searching the wiki, we'd sit together and he'd help guide me down the right path. If I was missing some technical knowledge, he'd push me towards how I could've gained that knowledge myself with the right prodding. Stuff like that.\n\nMaybe most importantly he was really patient, and knew that helping others was a *part of his job*. He was always happy to help, and he did so with a smile.\n\nThat's one mistake I see a lot of people making on this subreddit. People think that helping others means they have less time to do their ticket, or that it makes them replaceable, or that it's not their problem when other people get stuck.\n\nThat creates a toxic culture. Helping others is a *part of the job*. If Ticket A is late because I needed to help somebody? Not a problem, I have very clear justification on why Ticket A is late, and I communicated that early and often. If you're giving significant mentorship, then a good manager/PM will make sure you have a reduced sprint load, or even give you dedicated consulting tickets with points on them.\n\nI'm really thankful for my new grad tech lead, because I was able to take those very healthy practices, and carry them with me throughout my career. I cultivate that kind of a healthy culture wherever I go now.\n\nThat being said, after I left that new grad job with about 3.5 YOE, I didn't really receive mentorship anymore. The expectation became that I was the mentor.",

Usually expectations will be you should be able to answer coding questions better than a junior or mid level SWE, but YMMV based on company.\n\nWhen you are on the job, coding skills matter less as Senior and higher roles will be less about you coding 90% of the time and more about gathering consensus.  Soft skills start to matter more as you are participating in more meetings and things like that.  Again YMMV based on company.",

It’s extremely important. You might not code as much but you will be reading tons of it, you will need to understand how systems connect, performance, and tons of other things. Above all you will have to communicate and get buy in, from technical and non technical people. \n\nSo for both I would say communication is number 1.  I have met staff engineers who were meh technically but they were amazing at getting their ideas into production.

Even if you aren't writing code, you are probably weighing in on design choices, diving deep into high-profile operational issues, or helping teams with disagreements, all of which require understanding technical areas - someone without that understanding usually does not do well. \n\nThe other thing I've seen in my own career is that while I have gotten more senior, things have mostly shifted from depth to breadth. There was a time where I knew everything about my area: if you had a question about how to build a Java app using Spring storing data in Postgres, MySQL, DynamoDB or Mongo, that used Maven as a build script - I probably knew the answer (and still might, at least for whatever old version I used back in the day). Now, the set of things I weigh in spans a very broad set. As a result, in a lot of rooms I do not have the most detailed knowledge of the topic at hand, but I have a ton of context about a whole bunch of other things and how the particular decision fits into 53 other decisions we as a team are trying to make.\n\n>it took 2 months to get *one component* shipped.\n\nThere are two different reasons why this might be. On the one hand, at larger companies the consequences of getting something wrong are much higher, so it is worth it to make sure that component gets shipped the right way. On the other hand, it could be that, yes, you are suffering from bureaucracy. If you've ever had the opportunity to work with a really senior IC though, one of the things they can be great at is figuring out how to remove unnecessary bureaucracy (and navigating needed bureaucracy).",

The company I worked for the longest time had three employees and does not exist anymore (this was *fun* to explain to Japanese immigration for my work visa), and the largest company I ever worked for had 8000 employees worldwide. I have never had a problem getting interviews.\n\n2. Not all recognizable brands are good. Accenture's reputation is that they select for conformity, not skill.\n\n3. AI will have a massive shift soon. Pretty much everyone noticed by now that there have been several trillion dollars invested into AI by now, so there will now have to be a few trillion dollars in revenue, soon, or investors will pull the plug. It won't be entirely dead, but completely different.\n\n4. Employment laws and expectations in Japan and Europe are different. My expectation is that when the bottom drops out from the current AI boom, Accenture will focus on retraining you, and you may end up doing something completely different, but you will still have a job, while a mid-sized company may lay off people more quickly, but on the upside, you then already have a visa.\n\nSo basically, if your plan is to leave Japan, and your main skillset is AI related, the \"leave now\" option is likely better. Amsterdam is also a good place to start, the next opportunity might be in Berlin, which is also a nice city but much more of a culture shock, and more depressing in winter.",

It's nostalgic to look at but pretty useless - what matters is clients, what are you going to do even if it was legal to launch as competition would you maintain it yourself? Would you outpace a team of developers who are already familiar with the project and who have established clients that provide business feedback and existing infrastructure?\n\nIn my current company I've spent so much time documenting and maintaining one of the core services I could *probably* write it from memory even if security is pretty strict. So even if you weren't allowed you could recreate it given time.\n\nEven with all the security measures people are listing in the comments, you need a single WFH day or a secluded and unsupervised location in your office to simply use your phone to record your screen as you scroll through the code, even for a massive code base it would only take a few hours as the video can be slowed down later.\n\nApart from very specific things (namely algorithms that can be gamed like recommendation/ranking stuff) which are closely guarded, code by itself is pretty worthless.",

This usually means doing more but it is a good way to learn and actually gain experience. \n\nThis will probably get me blasted on this sub, but don't be afraid to take the 40-50k job that no one else wants. You are new to the dev world. Take it and start gaining experience. After a year, start looking for something else, job hop and increase your pay that way. \n\nPersonally, I started out at a really low paying job. But I worked my butt off. I learned the entire stack (building a server, configuring the network, building code, testing code, creating the CI/CD pipelines, deploying the code, [get blasted for not testing well enough], iterate on the code, redeploy, maintain the code. Then as time progressed, I learned more about micro services, cloud tech, load balancing and ways to handle very very large amounts of data. I got to the point where I knew the entire pipeline of the entire setup, I was then able to communicate with customers about what was possible and know how to fix stuff when things broke. \n\nIf you want to be the person everyone goes to, you need to gain the experience and know how to solve complex problems and more importantly be able to communicate the issues and ways to solve it in a way the customer understands.",

I graduated over 2 years ago, and I had some random people from my university try to cold connect for jobs via LinkedIn. I had a million things going on in my personal life, and when I circled back, they never replied. \n\nI think you just need to build things. I’ve learned the most when something didn’t work or got broken and then fixed it. You can find tutorials/courses on how to set things up. They’re not perfect, and quality varies greatly, but what else are you going to do? Hope you can find a stranger with enough free time who is also good enough to give you free training? It does happen, but I think it’ll be very hard to find. \n\nThere’s more info available than there ever has been. You can even use LLMs for some high-level guidance. Don’t wait for a perfect situation or hope someone will spoon-feed you. You might be able to find info/guidance in domain-specific subs, but you have to be careful, as there is a lot of advice out there. ",

A lot of my webdev friends are struggling to find work, but my C/C++ and embedded peers are only slightly affected by the downturn in the job market.\n\n\nAnother thing that can differentiate a project is using project management software to drive it. Most companies use Jira or similar to track tasks. Showing familiarity with Jira, it's git integrations, and following workflows does a lot to assure companies you can be productive and provide metrics. I, personally, don't put a lot of stock in such metrics, but the people hiring sure do. In the same vein, having examples of unit tests and CI/CD are also big.

I've got over 3 years of professional dev experience, a master degree, published academic research in AI applications, and I was laid off 3 months ago.

Even working as a technician or line operator can open doors to better opportunities and build your network at the right companies.

The question is how to leverage that experience to get interviews.  \n  \nIf you can't get interviews your probably falling short at the application stage (missing some keywords in your resume, or languages/tools that are needed for the job). If you ever get a denial reach out to the hiring manager and see what was missing from your experience and work on getting that experience even if it's solo work. Worse case the hiring person doesn't respond, best case they give you some pointers. (This is assuming it isn't a fake posting) \n\nIf you are you're getting interviews but not moving forward, then the HR or panel stage is the crux to get over. The HR round is your chance to show passion and explain how your background can benefit the **company**. The panel round is where you prove your technical knowledge and problem solving skills. Use your HR round to figure out what projects are currently being worked on by the company and figure out if they're interesting to you. You will burn out if you find the work boring, and then you're back to square 1. \n\nYou mentioned companies hiring people with more experience, sure that will happen, but I have worked with people who have 10+ years of experience and they still got laid off with me. They are struggling to get past the HR round because they got too comfortable, they lost their passion, ability to adapt, and put less effort into what a company needs and is hiring for. Effort and curiosity counts more than people think. the only thing better is experience.  \n  \nFocusing on projects is the best idea to open you up to getting experience. Even better than that is trying to contribute to open source of projects you're truly interested in. You'll be working with other developers, getting real world coding experience, and getting feedback on your code. This is a HUGE advantage when getting through the panel round with other engineers reviewing your work live. Keep building and publishing your work, and make sure recruiters can actually *see* what you’ve been working on. That visibility can make a huge difference.\n\nAgain this field is beyond tough right now, but keep applying, there are so many of us with experience looking for a job, but we are still working with other engineers to continue growing out knowledge an experience. Find your passion and drive yourself into it, employers will notice that more than you realize.",

I think in most cases management does not even know what \"quality code\" looks like and just relies on SWEs to do their job.  Now SWE \"talent\" comes in to play and most companies are not hiring big tech company level SWEs since they cannot compete with total compensation.\n\nI've worked on safety critical medical devices at private non-tech companies in non-tech cities, think dialysis machines, for my 15+ year career.   These companies have mature processes as they have been around for 30+ years. The devices we created were safe and had FDA approval, but the codebase was real spaghetti in many areas.\n\nMost of the time it came down to SWEs just working within the existing code base.  They don't really care about pushing for refactors unless it was absolutely necessary.  SWEs were not intentionally sabotaging the project.  They did the best they could with the skills they had.  Management doesn't complain about code quality so there is no issue from these SWEs perspective.\n\nThe SWEs at the majority of companies are not grinding DS&A or design patterns trying to get in to top tech companies.  They can code up features that do what they need to do and that's about it.  These companies are not trying to compete with big tech companies as they cannot come close to matching total compensation.\n\nThey try to sell themselves to SWEs in different ways, but it just attracts SWEs that:  (off the top of my head)\n\n* don't know the value of their talent\n* meet the companies bar, but would not be talented enough to get in to big tech companies for big pay\n* late in their career where they are financially secure to coast in a job\n\nSo this is a long way of saying, yes it's pretty common in the industry to have production ready code that is poorly designed.  I would even wager that is the expectation and not the expectation when you look at the industry at large and not a small slice like only big tech companies. \n\nI'd bet even if you went to look at some codebase at google there would be SWEs that say this is poorly designed we need to refactor.  Most of the time the refactor is now worth it and as a SWE you take it as a lesson learned for the next time you do the same or similar thing.",

Angry employees don't tend to give the most honest, or \"fair\" reviews. Someone who just got fired for bad performance usually isn't going to go on Glassdoor and write a review that says \"Got fired, my fault, great company though!\". They're going to do everything they can to drag that company through the mud.\n\nPositive reviews are the same way. Those usually aren't very genuine either. HR often encourages their employees to leave positive reviews while they work there. Those won't be genuine either.\n\nAn anecdote of mine, I was considering joining an established startup, and their Glassdoor had a bunch of reviews complaining about nepotism, and how if you aren't buddy buddy with the CEO, you'll never get good raises or get promoted.\n\nI didn't get that vibe at all when I spoke with my hiring manager, the team, a manager from another team, and the CTO. So I joined them anyways.\n\nI stayed at that company 5 long years. I got *several* of the biggest raises I've gotten in my 12 year long career there, by a pretty huge margine. I got promoted twice, including to Senior, without any action or politicking on my part, they were handed to me on merit unprompted.\n\nI'm the last person to be \"buddy buddy\" with anyone at work. I don't like to chit chat, I don't like going to company happy hours. I certainly wasn't buddies with the CEO or CTO (or anyone for that matter). Doubt the CEO even knew my name. The CTO and I spoke once in a blue moon. I just went into work and did my job, and then left. And yet, huge raises, multiple promotions.\n\nPretty sure the people that were leaving those negatives reviews didn't get good raises or promotions *because they didn't deserve them*.

So you provide them with optionality.\n\nSo my professional opinion is that you should focus your learning on what interests you most, and explore various domains.

        "body": "AI is definitely changing how we work so the key is learning how to work with AI instead of competing against it. Cloud, networking, cybersecurity, and even data are all being enhanced by AI, not replaced. For example, AI tools might automate small tasks (like monitoring servers or cleaning data), but people will still be needed to set things up, make decisions, and handle complex problems that AI can’t. The folks who understand both tech and AI will actually become more valuable.\n\nOnce you build up a tech foundation, it’s pretty easy to switch paths. If you start in cloud and later want to move into AI or automation, your cloud knowledge will carry over. Same with data as if you learn Python and SQL, you can pivot into analytics, AI, or even DevOps later. So you’re not locking yourself into one lane forever, you’re just building stepping stones.",

You can also ask it to do web searches or research for you, if you tell it to find learning resources or videos for you (based on topics or styles that you tell it that you prefer).\n\nFor example, if you have an enterprise approved AI LLM you can use, then when one of your AI/ML peers publishes a document or a slide deck, you can just upload the doc and give it a prompt like this \"I am a software engineer, trying to learn more about AI/ML. One of my coworkers shared this doc recently, can you help break it down and explain what it means? Assume I know basic software and technology concepts, but that I have no advanced statistics or data science training.\" \n\nOf course, if you don't have a safe enterprise AI to use, then you can't be uploading sensitive documents to your personal subscription. But you can still take certain key phrases or concepts that are generic, and ask Claude or ChatGPT to explain then (e.g. what is XGBoost? how do you run an A/B test? what does stat sig mean? how does deep learning work? etc.).\n\nUsing an AI LLM is no substitute for real education or reading and studying textbooks, and it won't make you transform into a full ML engineer overnight or something... but it can actually be a very useful starting point for someone who is a beginner. Eventually you can use it to help you generate sample projects, build your own ML model as a tutorial, etc. \n\nAlso, once you feel like you've got a basic grasp, then you should graduate from asking your initially dumb questions to your AI LLM only, to asking (slightly?) less dumb questions to your actual coworkers. Don't pester them and don't make them responsible for teaching you, but generally speaking if you show serious interest in learning and put in work yourself, most people are happy to talk about their work with you (especially if, as an engineer, you might sometimes be able to help unblock them in various ways, then you can trade knowledge sharing and favors with them).",

And I know people that have children that just leave them in the States and either get a parent to watch them or hire a babysitter.\n\nI will never understand the people that just put their entire lives on hold as soon as they have a kid. If that's what having a kid is like, I never fucking want kids. But luckily I have plenty of examples of people I know that have still lived their lives to its fullest even with kids. Hell, that couple I mentioned beforehand? *They travelled more than me that year*. I'm single, with no kids. And yet somehow, with a newly born child, they travelled more than me. They're living life right.\n\nI know I didn't answer your question at all, and I introduced even more questions... so apologies for that, but I think your perspective is creating a lot of issues in your mind that don't need to exist. This isn't a \"now or never\" situation. Your career shouldn't be an ultimatum of \"I can only take extended breaks when I'm unemployed\". You can have a balanced life, and a balanced career, without reaching for extremes.",

Others have everyone fending for themselves. You need to try to figure out which one the company you're talking to is. Another problem is if they're a smaller company, they might have fewer clients. Find out how many clients they have and the nature of their contracts. I worked at a contracting company that tried to present themselves as a consulting company. They had two clients when I interviewed, but then lost one between when I accepted the offer and started. They eventually lost their last client and had some layoffs along with a bunch of people leaving to join the company that took over the contract. \n\nAnother challenge, like with any company, is how much the interviewers actually lie to you or not. For example, I was told during my interviews the contract was for three years. It was actually three 1-year options, so they had to be renewed each year. \n\nTry to get an idea if they're really doing consulting work or they are more staffing/contracting. Especially with less experience, you'll probably be doing more development work. Normally, the higher you are in a company, the more they want you to be doing sales. You also want to get an idea of how they get new projects, and what their project pipeline looks like.",

I will say usually when it's looking bad now, it's safe to assume to say it would look better in 3 years and the best time to get into something is when everyone is avoiding it. I get the fear of AI, but the way i see it AI will either replace jobs or can make more jobs. Like if a a team of 10 can complete 30 tasks  (3 each) in a month without a AI. But 1 engineer with AI can complete 6 tasks a month. Some companies may just fire half but i think most companies will keep the 10 like the fact that they can get more tasks done, meet deadlines easier, etc. Now that creates better bonuses and profit for everybody and the following year there may be enough money to hire more people.\n\nNow if you are struggling in your classes and are stressed out, id recommend going into EE or even CE. I knew many kids who dropped out of CS and CE because they couldnt handle the coidng classes. Coding was much harder than they expected. In my school IT was seen as the CS dropout degree because IT had a low application rate, but a high transfer rate. Like IT courses would be empty fall of freshman year but by spring of freshman or fall of sopohemore year, the classes would be packed.",

It’s obviously not true but somehow still true at the same time: applications to a job take a lot less work than to a college (also college applications take money). Most problems asked in coding interviews are honestly not Leetcode hard level for big tech. You can get unlucky but they ask a lot of medium with follow up to hard. The interviewers are just people working their job every day and they don’t want to ask a question nobody can understand, there’s no joy to sitting awkwardly for 45 minutes.

Managers will manually review the 100 applicants down to 20 they are interesting in doing phone screens with. The phone screens are ~15 minute conversations where the manager asks some very basic questions.\n* **Interview Stage**: 4 - 6. Managers will conduct phone screens with the 20 applicants and from that pick around 5 +/- a one or two that they want to interview\n* **Interview Rounds**: In my group we usually do two rounds of interviews. First one is typically remote unless the applicant lives nearby but the second one is always mandatory in person. Each round is pretty similar but with different groups of engineers. The managers will sit in and watch but let the engineers do all the actual interviewing. The actual interviews are about 30% behavioral/personality and 70% coding checks. The coding checks are pretty simple. Nothing from leetcode. Just basic programming questions or prompts to write simple functions. We are mostly just looking to see if you actually know how to code and didn't cheat your way through college. The questions barely get harder than fizz-buzz level and yet still like 50% of the applicants fail massively at this stage.\n\n\nSo if we use 2K as the total number of applicants. Then ~5% of resumes are actually looked at by a person. ~1% make it to phone screens. ~0.25% make it to interview stage. Keep in mind these percentages include all the non-eligible candidates which are all automatically filtered out.",

May seem like a lot but it’s better than pretending to know. \n\nI’d recommend making a documentation of some kind on the codebase and being diligent in recording each step taken when doing a task. Then you can refer back to your notes and eventually it starts to paint an overall picture of the code base you are working on. \n\nFor example start by creating notes on the files in the code base you are most familiar with and then move on from there. Can even be 2-3 sentences if you don’t fully know - Auth.ts “This code deals with the security of client.” \n\nEventually with good documentation will help clear things up, good luck!",

This confidence comes from several sources depending on your environment and your team/org structure:\n\n1. Knowing who knows what. At large companies with lots of knowledge silos, this is probably the most important bit. Most likely, the unfamiliar bits of the codebase is also owned by them, so if you need to make changes there, you'd have to get their buy-in anyways\n2. Knowing how to find what you're looking for - both in terms of the codebase tooling (e.g. if you guys have a bespoke code search or repo management layer) as well as a high-level idea of how things are generally organized (and this usually goes back to #1) and how to trace through the difference packages, as well as relevant documents or memos that have documented relevant design discussions and decisions\n3. Having the (un)earned confidence that things will go well - I actually think this is the most important aspect. Most of the time, it's easier to just assume that you'll find what you're looking for and not fret too much about the task. This comes with time, and I find that not stressing out about unknowns is just as important as being competent in the domains you do know.",

        "body": "Startups can be a *lot* of fun, but for every 10 startups you'll find 1 great one, 2 great ones that will still fail, and 7 that are some level of bad to awful.\n\nA **successful** startup (and I can't stress this enough - those are VERY rare) will go through 2-5 rounds of fundraising, \"pre-seed\" is the first one. At this point, the company has managed to convince a venture capitalist to part with a small amount of money. Don't take this as a sign of confidence though - to you and me it's the equivalent of lending a friend $5 to play the slots and promise us 20% of whatever they win.\n\nIf they *are* successful (again - super rare) it can be an awesome pay day for you... but that pay day also can take a *long long* time. I joined one startup back in 2015 that *still* hasn't had an exit event - the $880 worth of stock I got back then is now worth about $110k (back of the envelope) but I can't (reasonably) actually do anything with it because it's still private equity.\n\nI joined another startup \\~2 years ago though, which had a more typical liquidation exit - I got a fat offer from the next company that hired me and more career advancement in the year of working there than in the 5 preceding years in FAANG combined, but my $160k of equity earned me a total of $0 because there wasn't anything left over after the debts and preferred stock was paid out. Even *that* was a pretty lucky case - I was working for *way* less than I was worth and really stretching myself to do so, if my next (current) employer hadn't taken notice of me I would have just found myself sitting around putting my heart and soul into something with nothing to show for it.\n\n**Startups are FANTASTIC for learning a lot of things \"in the trenches\" though**. **This is NOT appropriate for everybody.** If you're really ambitious and love being part of the rat race (especially early career where this is especially helpful!) it can be an awesome thing. It means late days, doing things *way* outside your comfort zone, learning skills that you should never have to deal with as an engineer... but that also means getting a broad skill set and great experience in a short time.\n\nIn my experience, judge the founders *very critically*. I like to ask founders hard questions to see how they react. It takes experience in business and industry to get a feel for what's good / not good, what you like / don't, I can't really give great advice here - but if you're interested in young companies and startups, the best way to get that experience is the hard way!\n\nIf you're happy with the base pay and want to hustle for a bit, it could be a good opportunity. It will be a hustle, odds are much more than 50/50 that you'll end up working your ass off for something that fails, but you'll learn a ton along the way and make some good connections. The people you meet at startups are, disproportionately, the kind of professional connection that'll be really valuable to you in 5-10 years as well.",

Containerize a small Java service, push to ECR, deploy to ECS Fargate or EKS. Provision with Terraform (VPC, IAM, RDS), wire CI/CD with GitHub Actions, add canary/blue‑green, alerts in CloudWatch/Prometheus, and cost alarms. Practice runbooks, rollbacks, backup/restore, and least‑privilege IAM. At work, volunteer to own the pipeline, infra modules, or a lift‑and‑shift of a legacy service; that experience counts more than certs, but AWS SAA then Developer or DevOps Pro will help you get callbacks.\n\nDay to day is less feature coding and more incidents, reliability, and cost/security reviews. Market’s decent for platform/SRE, but entry is noisy; real deployments and on-call stories beat toy labs. I’ve used AWS API Gateway and Kong to manage APIs, and brought in DreamFactory to quickly expose Snowflake and SQL Server as REST during a migration.\n\nIt’s worth it if you can show ops chops and accept on-call; your Java background plus a focused lab and internal wins can get you there.",
