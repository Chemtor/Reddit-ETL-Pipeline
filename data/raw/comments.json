It's not a \"commercial open source\" project with an \"enterprise version\" or \"hidden proprietary features,\" like Delta and other similar projects. The project itself is not very popular or exciting, and Apache Spark is often considered \"not modern.\" However, I know that half of the identity resolution projects at a real-world scale of billions of entities rely on GraphFrames' implementation of the Connected Components algorithm. If one needs to cluster graphs on a scale of billions, compute centralities, etc., GraphFrames is the solution. GraphFrames is the only known to me open-source project that can handle such a scale without requiring separate infrastructure. It takes up almost all of my free time, around six to eight hours per week (unpaid, of course), but I'm happy to work on something interesting. What could be better than taking a scientific paper with a distributed graph algorithm and putting it into Scala code? After my routine paid job of moving data from one place to another and doing boring ETLs, GraphFrames contributions are like fresh air to me.",

If you know what you are doing, it can be helpful so you can focus on the intricate and complex and not fatigue at the mundane or redundant. \n\nThe current push in \"AI\", which most only know as the effects of LLMs will think their approach is novel when it is actually novice. Industry and government have seen periodic phases of this and like those phases the masses will move onto the next fad before they have gained any understanding in the prior. \n\nAs a cross between a scientist and an engineer I have seen these waves appear and receed. Each time people like me are subjected to the beatings of unbridled and undirected passion by those who have not spent their time earning an understanding and respecting it for what it is. We then pick up the pieces when that frenzy fades into the abyss. \n\nI do believe that these tools are useful for those who understand how to use them while understanding their assumptions, limitations, and correct use cases. I believe this is what sets us apart from those caught up in a layman's understanding of the latest advancement.\n\nThis does not mean that our types won't be in for a wild ride of unnecessary pain and suffering but at the end of the day it is this 1% that keep society balanced on a blade's edge between order and chaos.\n\nI hope this was helpful.",

It is like comparing \"Ford vs a V8\" -- what? That's not even the same category of thing.\n\nDo a comparison of Iceberg and Delta Lake in both Databricks and another execution engine so you can compare the difference of the two formats. Or change the comparison to be Databricks vs a more self-managed Glue.\n\nAlso \"without vendor lock-in\" seems like it has little real basis. Delta Lake can be read and written by multiple different execution engines. Databricks code is still just SQL and/or pyspark, and it reads/writes to cloud storage that can be access by other execution engines. There's no more or less lock-in between Databricks and Glue -- they both have their custom extensions to pyspark and their own catalogs.",

For a while I've been able to weight the proportion towards admin/engineering/come-architecture work because of some team changes around me, and seniority, I guess.\n\nBack to the blurry line, though.  If a data engineer \"does pipelines\"... WTF even is a \"pipeline\"?  Isn't it just input to output?  What's the output of a data engineer?  Varies wildly, I'd say.  Probably also very dependent on team makeup, like mine.  If output is data at a cleaned/\"silver\" state where an \"analyst\" or \"modeller\" comes in to then make it star schema or something else: well, for me in my place, that's not worth much.  50% value kind of thing.  Good for the self service analyst who wants to just get it into Excel.  Maybe you don't want to build enterprise reports with it, though, for example.\n\nSo, if a \"data engineer does pipelines\" is part of the definition of an engineer, and that pipeline involves extracting data from an SQL server or an API feed into some kind of staging area in a warehouse or data lake....  I repeat my thinking, that's half the job at best, and worth that much.  In that case we would do some general analysis of the raw/source data; set up some options in config/metadata; set up the automation; and that's kind of that bit done.  The rest is *analysis*, *modelling*.\n\nSo, I guess I do arguably quite a lot of analyst work as an engineer.  Sorry for the waffle.",

Business wants you to say ‘yes this is accurate’, then shit on you if they find something they deem inaccurate, it’s typical cover-your-ass where words like ‘accountable’ get thrown around - things can get spicy, but rarely get better. First Come up with a definition of what must be in place for you to ‘trust’ a data source - eg minimum 100 randomly sampled days over a 3 year timeline showing 0% variance from your ‘source of truth’ reports, maybe you need monitoring, referential integrity testing etc - whatever you think you would need to be able to say to them ‘yes, based on our definition of accurate, this is accurate’. Once you have that list, make a spreadsheet that lists sources, and which boxes on your ‘trust checklist’ they meet or not. This should be something you personally believe vs a list off the internet IMO as you need to adapt it to your businesses goals / quality thresholds. \n\nDepending on how familiar you are with the data sources, prioritize that list and have a discussion with management about why/what needs to get implemented. If they deny it, every time something wrong gets caught in production, make a note on that list of which data sources had problems because a feature in your checklist wasn’t implemented. \n\nThis makes things less emotional/loose and more working in quantifiable/tangible steps towards achievable goals - you do just have to hold the line on the pressure thing, keep discussions very black and white & honest about timelines business can expect - don’t fall into the trap of grossly underestimating just to keep them happy, those timeline bills come due eventually. \n\nGood luck!",

I suppose, do I ever know confidentially what I will be working on in 6 months? Let alone predict it for someone else, let alone a *new* person?  We do the needful. \n\n>the documentation for their stuff is atrocious to say the least\n\nWELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD JACKASS! But seriously this will usually (always?) be the case. \n\n>I basically had to resort on making my OWN documentation\n\nYup.  I have a sweet \"make a .txt file of notes\" system myself.  Though eventually you won't need them as you get more familiar. \n\n>The culture / it's people is a hit or miss\n\nThis *does* vary a lot by company.  Everywhere I worked has had a distinctive culture. \n\n>riding an emotional rollercoaster because of the work load / tension from the amount of p1 or escalation incidents that have happened on the short span of a month.\n\nThis is probably, mostly, because you're new.  \n\nYou don't know how their stuff works. You don't know where to look (or where it's pointless to look), and you don't know who to ask about X (or who it's pointless to ask about X).  This will get better.  Restarting this process is the worst part of job switching imo. \n\n>Are jobs supposed to feel like this?\n\nConceptually, everything you described seems very typical. \n\n> I'm contemplating whether if its worth to stay given the brutality of the job market or just find another job. \n\nOf course, go nowhere until you have another offer.  \n\nIf you can get another (seemingly better) offer - great.  Keep in mind if you leave this place after say, 6 months - what if the next place is also unexpectedly not what you want?  Are you going to feel stuck for awhile, cuz you don't want **two** 6 months stints in a row on your resume?\n\nPersonally, I'd relax on job searching and plan to stick around at least >= 1 years to learn things well there, learn what your options are there, and have it be a 'safe' tenure on your resume.  But I know people who have done some rapid, consecutive hops, and done well too, so grain of salt.\n\nSidenote: Maybe watch Office Space if you never have?",

This is most often done when rapidly prototyping in a tool like PowerBI. \n\nOBT also works better for some niche storage / warehouse types. An example of this would be Microsoft ADX which actually has very poor join performance if you have a dimensional table that may be large. ADX has no row indexes which means lookup key performance is very bad. In order to mitigate this limitation ADX very much favors OBT data design over dimensionaal / Kimball modeling.",

Watch some YT videos on how DM interviews are done, there's tons of mockup interview videos. Maybe take Udemy course if you want.\nThen learn distributed storage and compute (Snowflake, Databricks). Either of these are almost used across different domains for DWH. \nRemember, Snowflake is easy to pickup since it does all the background work like cluster mgmt, micro partitions where as Databricks has slightly uphill learning curve since the users need to learn resource and cluster management, partitioning, etc. \n\nIn data engineering world, both AWS and Azure are heavily used. Companies that has web based application tend to use AWS from my past experience. In US, both AWS and Azure are popular. In Canada, have seen more of a Microsoft shop across.\nNot many companies use GCP in data engineering world.

It's better if you use a combination of standard approaches (column level masking with policy tags, row level access controls, authorised views) in my opinion.\n\nYou _can_ use custom masking routines in your column level security. This involves creating a UDF that operates on the column and decides how to mask it. To make this work, you need to insert suitable info into the column, so you'd need to do something a bit hacky:\n\n1. create a column in an upstream layer indicating whether a row's ID is present in your list of those-to-be-masked\n2. prepend some identifier to the column of interest if it's in a row that needs masking\n\n```\nSELECT\n    CONCAT(\n        IF(to_be_masked, 'MASKME::', ''),\n        valuable_col\n    ) AS valuable_col,\n...\n```\n\n3.

NiFi has some nice retry mechanisms built into it, so I can set up a job to try up to 10 times, every 5 minutes, and then if it still fails, to shoot me Slack notification out to let us know about the problem.\n\nIt's a low code tool where you drag and drop modules, but as far as low code goes, it's very \"low level\".  You aren't going to have a \"Stripe\" module, but there is an \"InvokeHTTP\" module, where you can make any type of HTTP call, so just like you'd have to set the request type (POST, GET, PUT, etc), API enpoint and HTTP headers in Python, you'd have to set those in NiFi as well.  You need to have technical understanding of how things work, but NiFi itself makes building the actually jobs really easy.  You can inspect data as it moves between different modules, so troubleshooting is really, really easy.",

Meaning its not a a run-at-3-am cron scheduler, but instead events & rules on an aws event bus. So in this example the \"choosing batch\" does not automatically exclude the Event Driven part. Our glue jobs were built to process records in batch, but then we also went back and swapped out the scheduled runs with pub-sub events.... and all of this was done **without touching the glue code...**\n\n  \nBatch to streaming is a bigger effort to transition to. Scheduled to event driven is much easier, I do not mind using aws event bridge + step functions. Eventually I'll get around to refreshing quicksight data sets with the same pattern. \n\n\n\nThe use case we up against still does **not require streaming**, It's more about cramming a growning amount of ETL into the off business hours. This is becoming more of a need and less of a wish as complexity grows and threading needles with schedules no longer is practical.",

Almost all data pipelines I build leverage small micro-batches with event & temporal triggering:  \n\n   * Data streams into files on s3, persisted once either a time or size threshold is met.  Max time is typically 1-15 minutes, depending on the feed.\n   * Once it lands all further processing is typically event-driven leveraging s3 event notifications and parallel processing kubernetes, ecs, lambda, or whatever.\n   * If downstream apps need to run against newly-arriving files, they can subscribe to s3 event notifications for when they do.  These can also be translated to load timestamps & ids if the apps want to query the database rather than just read the s3 file.\n   * If downstream apps need to run against a certain newly-arrived period of data (ex: the most recent day/hour/etc) then a specific agent is responsible for periodically querying the data and is solely responsible for dictating when a given period is complete.  And then it sends out a sns message and apps can subscribe to that.\n\nThe net results is that it's extremely resistant to data quality problems from late-arriving data, it delivers data as quickly as it's economically feasible, most of the system is fault-tolerant and self-healing, and you don't have bloated daily processes failing in the middle of the night and lengthy outages, you deploy during the day, you know immediately if there are problems, and it doesn't take 8 hours in the middle of the night to know if the fix worked.",

There are some people (usually from a Java background and sometimes C++) that seem to think all production code must be OOP which it sounds like you have run into. This mindset leads to odd things in Python, like classes with only one method other than init (just write a function) and classes with only static methods (just put the functions in a module).\n\nPython often lets you write simple clean code by just putting functions in modules or passing them as arguments without classes. In a lot of DE code, functions are often only run once rather than many times across an application so there is less utility for OOP than there is in SWE.\n\nOOP is worth knowing of course. Some examples from the last week I've had is writing my own Operators and Hooks in Airflow which requires you to inherit from various base classes, another would be managing database connections. I have also written code using the connector design pattern to allow easy connections to many different cloud storages for a pipeline.\n\nPython is a very loosy goosey language in OOP terms so I'd stick to Python specific resources or you will get confused. I'd recommend \"Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming: Build robust and maintainable software with object-oriented design patterns in Python 3.8\" by Dusty Phillips. You don't need to read all of it, if you know what an Abstract Base Class is and why you'd use one and why composition is favoured over inheritance then move on to Arjan Codes' design pattern videos on youtube.",

If you have 4 worker nodes each with 8 cores you need to repartition or coalesce by 32 and the column you're partitioning on (assuming all the data for one partition can fit in the proportion of each machine so you don't get memory issues where the data either gets split or you get out of memory errors )\n\n\nThat way all the data for each write will be grouped on the one node you're using and each writer will just be able to write the full partition.\n\n\nYou get multiple files when spark is writing to one location from multiple writers , as it can't append columns , only write new files ",

A really common reason for doing analytics in Postgres is that there is some existing application database, and people want to know some stats about the usage of the application. So you do the obvious thing and query the application db (or hopefully a read-replica of it) to get those answers. And it works great at smallish scale.  \n\nI’ve reached maybe 1/2 of the scale you provided before giving up and migrating to a purpose-built analytics db. Skill issue?  Maybe.  But I never found a good solution in Postgres to make large aggregate queries with many joins and group by’s fast enough, without manually adding an index to many columns.  It started to feel like trying to jam a square peg into a round hole.\n\nThese days it’s pretty simple to replicate pertinent data out of an application db into an analytics db to build dashboards. You can even add those dashboards back into the application.  I think the juice is worth the squeeze to bite the bullet and use the best application database there is (Postgres ftw) and some other db for analytics.",

Source data: Ask engineers/data generators to fill out DBT Source YAMLs. They are technical, and probably won’t mind the interfacing. Also ask for existing docs, design reviews, and the code. AI should be able to read the code and tell you what it’s doing. \n2. Transforms: Same thing with analysts/wh users. Describe the table/views/columns and ask them to state their assumptions. Their data is a lot of work and valuable! We’re moving towards making data products. \n3 exposures: approach business owners and those reporting to business and at this point just ask for the reports/models/ which see important and a URL which can get you to the report, or to know what is being referenced. “If you tell us what you’re looking at, we can ensure it’s not impacted by warehouse changes and upstream data evolving”\n\n\n1. The data portability alone is worth it. DBT docs are accepted everywhere - you can pull them into warehouses, data vendors, data catalog tools, and it has its own free portal you and put oh GitHub pages.\n2. Get SQL writers to use DBT templating. Big org win. Otherwise you can rewrite their tables with a script and show them a lineage graph, and then they will start using DBT\n3.

You can download later books in pdf, and ebook format, and mobi in this bundle for few titles too.

We packaged it and exposed it through a FastAPI endpoint. It was deployed on k8s with a load balancer for horizontal and elastic scaling. The main app called the endpoint with the payload and we answered with a float (the score).  \nUsing FastAPI background tasks, we sent asynchronously the payload, timestamp and score as a JSON to S3 (we could also have published it to Kafka). Then, a small ETL orchestrated by Prefect imported the JSONs into ClickHouse. The API was capable of answering the request in \\~100ms. It was fast enough for the small product we had back then.\n\nComing back to Flink: I believe that for usecases that requires statefulness, it is indeed the best solution. You could also use Spark, even though it will very likely be slower. Another good fit is TImeplus/Proton (waaaaaaay easier to setup than Flink, the tradeoff being the flexibility on the choice of the pattern).",

The result of the silver and gold stage are both written into a table in the duckDB database, which is a \\`.duckdb\\` file (no \"raw files\" like in bronze). I believe duckDB does not support an incremental write into external locations/Delta Tables through dbt at the moment.\n\n3) Yes, I simply query the gold table from the database. I added the duckDB database as resource in Dagster and by this it can be easily used in assets.

Companies were all US but across sectors from retail to tech.\naside: Negotiate people! I had access to the numbers and contractors that were doing the same role, same tasks could have 75k spreads in salary. Also change jobs, you don't owe any company anything and it's how you really bump your salary. \n\nProjects I did as a contractor with PSO included:\nBuilding a CLI wrapper around GCP's CMLE that allowed data scientists with local PCs, with graphics cards, to have a containerized workflow that would work locally and a flag of '--cloud' would run the same job on CMLE. Crazy reduction in spin up times, validation of flags and savings on cost of spinning up clusters with hundreds of graphics cards for 10 minutes to fail during startup. \n\nLots of data migrations. \"Get this Oracle DB into the cloud like bigquery... no its license expired and we don't have the ability to do CDC or replicas to avoid pulling too much during working hours oh and you need to use a vpn tunnel that is 25mb/s.. no we don't know what data we want so get everything... how does cloud work?\"\n\nHelped a startup convert their Data Workflows that executed in an on prem location to separate compute from storage, then containerize compute, then migrate storage to the cloud, then migrate remaining compute to the cloud. (Not distributed compue. Python/Java ETLs).\n\nAnd really, listening to a ton of meetings that cover insider Political BS(Which team owns what data, who should have permissions, VP wants method A but acquired company does it method B and wants to keep the current method, etc). Realizing when your contract is just to 'validate' some execs preferences and agreeing. Also constantly pushing back on Realtime data everywhere.",

Log filename, row counts, checksums, and load status in a control table; redirect bad rows to a reject folder with a reason code. After a successful run, move files to an archive with a timestamp. Deploy to the SSIS Catalog, schedule via SQL Agent with retries and email alerts. This gives you audit trails, restartability, and easier handoffs than ad‑hoc scripts. For Access migration, point forms/reports at SQL views or stored procs and retire most VBA.\n\nIf you stick with Python, wrap it in a single CLI, write to the same control table, call BULK INSERT or bcp for speed, and schedule with SQL Agent instead of Task Scheduler. I’ve used Azure Data Factory and Prefect for orchestration, and DreamFactory to auto-generate REST over SQL Server so Access/VBA could poll load status and logs.\n\nSSIS with SQL Agent is the clean, maintainable path here.",

I think that is ideal to get started with local development, as it also creates a basic Airflow project structure for you, where you can add your DAG. If you are on mac, just install it via brew install astro, then make a new directory for your project and run:\n\n    astro dev init\n\nAnd afterwards, run the following command to start your local Airflow environment:\n\n    astro dev start\n\nI would not recommend switching to Airflow 2, there are enough pragmatic ways to get the latest version running. If you still have issues, please share a few environment details and the actual error.\n\nHave fun 🫶",

Like, are you just ingesting a few tables from one system, one business process... Or an entire enterprise worth of different business processes, tens of systems, etc? And what kind of source data formats - just SQL databases, or less-structured APIs, etc?\n- how much transformation, data cleansing, etc etc will need to happen between raw data and final semantic models?\n\nRemember you don't have to follow a literal bronze/silver/gold structure - people often take medallion architecture too literally. If your use case is simple with one SQL source, you might only need a raw/bronze kind of layer to land the data, then straight to gold/final in one hop. If your use cases and data are complex you might need more than three layers, and you might differentiate one layer to multiple workspaces thematically, even just within prod.\n\nFor small teams and simpler scenarios, you also don't _necessarily_ need separate dev and test environments. Depends on what tools you're using within Fabric, how you're testing, who is testing, how deployments are managed, how often things are changing, etc. Sometimes, testing can reasonably happen in the same workspace you develop in, then you just promote to prod.",

Not to discourage you, but my two cents if you're main goal is maximising TC, I'd say getting into IT isn't worth it. No one knows, but my guess is you're path of maximal TC will be to stick in traditional eng and eventually transition to management. That will probably pay off better in the long term and be easier then trying to move to IT/DE.\n\nIf you do want advice on moving, I made the transition through self study. What I did first, and my recommendation is to start with cs50 which is Harvard's free into to computer science course. I think it's worth doing even if you end up studying a master's. If probably also recommend casting a wide net for data or software engineering, especially look out for embedded engineering which might be a good niche giving your background. Good luck again!",

Don’t violate the bronze access restrictions (silver builders only), don’t call anything gold that’s not in a state that’s consumable by the business as a whole. Other than that it’s need based discretionary access to different layers of silver. You give more scrutiny to the new kid in marketing trying to circumvent the process because he doesn’t understand how things work than you do to the data science team doing a sanctioned POC.\n\nPeople often get hung up on the 3 layer system rather than thinking about why the boundaries are there. Less labels, more principles I say. \n\nEdit: Another caveat is that something “uncleansed” that is to be used for a special purpose and not as a regular silver building block should be tagged as such. Maybe we call it Nickel",

You'll configure the connection in your script (spark.read.jdbc) each time you need to extract data, but it'll give you flexibility in how you interact with the db and the ability to tune your extract. \nRelevant docs: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-jdbc.html\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/spark/connector?view=sql-server-ver17\n\nOption 2: Add the SQLServer as a foreign catalog in Databricks. This will populate an object in the Databricks catalog that allows you to query/explore the DB as though it were a native table. Downside is that performance can be rough as you relinquish control over the query in favor of a simpler interface. Spoiler: this is using JDBC under the hood\nRelevant docs: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/query-federation/sql-server\n\n\nThere are other ways (sqlalchemy for example), but these two options have worked well in my experience.\n\nIf you're pulling multiple tables from the same db, set up a class or set of functions to allow yourself to reuse them for any datasets you need to pull. This way your workflow can read like a series of simple steps ex: get_max_cdc_column, fetch_new_data, add_metadata_columns, write_to_delta. Added benefit here is you can quickly whip up new ingests by passing different args to your functions.",

Also similar to Salesforce DataCloud and Snowflake, same concept.\n\nWhy export into something, then send it, then import it, to process it into staging? Just a lot of overhead.\n\nThe only valid reason to do something else is for API's that need event-driven updates in near real-time between systems. Else, read directly. Use any audit columns to your advantage to make incremental loads. Some systems you have no choice, no direct access to the MSSQL server, so you must use API or whatever else is given.\n\nWhen in doubt and vendor-based software (like an ERP) - use API first, direct query second. As the vendor can do schema changes and break your code. Not with APIs.\n\nWe have local VMs and azure VMs and I connect directly, albeit with the approriate security in place, and a staging layer. Complex queries across the network over Linked Server is a big NO - don't do that. Single table pulls are fine. Combine later from staging.",

Then one Databricks DLT or Auto Loader pipeline per DB using apply\\_changes for upserts, with a jobs cluster or serverless and autoscale. Use Trigger.AvailableNow for micro-batch or continuous if latency matters. Compact small files and VACUUM on schedule.\n\nIf you want managed CDC, Estuary or Fivetran are easy; DIY is Debezium -> Event Hubs/Kafka -> ADLS sink. I’ve used Fivetran and Estuary for SQL Server CDC, and DreamFactory when we needed a quick REST layer over odd sources with no connector.\n\nCost/control tips: consolidate pipelines, reuse a shared job cluster, use spot where safe, and separate bronze/silver/gold by schema. Handle drift as add-only where possible; treat renames as add+drop and keep a dead-letter path.\n\nNet: centralize compute and offload or standardize CDC; let Databricks focus on transforms.",

With tech or coding, no one cares *how* you learned the skills; you can pick them up on the side. I used the fundamentals of economic thinking to guide how and why I learned technology.\n\nIn 2025, you barely need more than CS50 level coding skills and a few personal projects to get started. And when the tech bubble burst, I wasn’t lumped in with the thousands of CS grads who could code but didn’t understand the business problems they were solving, which is a very dangerous trap.\n\nFor me, having an analytical mindset with a self-driven focus on technology opened a ton of doors, gave me flexibility, and has been lucrative. I didn’t make as much as my CS friends when we graduated in 2017, but I eventually caught up and even moved ahead into management and strategy roles while many of them stayed or are stuck being code monkeys or data janitors (still well-paid, but gets old quick).",

This is similar to giving them access to a database that you own, but gives you better cost and load protection: they'll be using their own compute to read it so it's less likely they'll blow up your bill by reading the data (though they can rack up big egress fees if your dataset is large).\n* you can share data directly to your customer's database or data warehouse. The upside is that the data shows up directly where they're ready to consume it, and they have to do zero work in order to get the data. It's also much more secure than letting them access your database directly (for example, they can't take your database down by accident by putting undue load on it). The downside is that it can be more or less cumbersome for your team to implement, depending on whether you build it in house or use existing tools. If you decide to use tools for this, assuming your data exists in places other than that RDS instance, you can leverage some of the native sharing functionality of some data warehouses (eg Databricks' Delta Sharing, or Snowflake's Data Sharing). Alternatively, you can use a vendor like us ([https://prequel.co](https://prequel.co/)) that will let you write data from your database instance directly to your customer's db / warehouse regardless of what stack they run.\n\n*Full transparency: we're a software vendor in this space.*",

The one case where we still see this with abctl is when it’s running on a VM that’s below our minimum recommended resources - in that scenario, performance can degrade in exactly the ways you’re describing.\n\nThe other factor here is your specific use case: Postgres-to-Postgres. Postgres isn’t a great database for moving large amounts of data, so even outside Airbyte, this pattern tends to be slow.\n\nNormally I’d suggest our Flex product, which handles these workloads much more gracefully, but I understand you’re looking for something that’s predictable in cost. In that case, I think the best next step is to understand why the Cloud version isn’t performing well for you - since Cloud should not exhibit any of the problems you’re seeing on abctl. If we can diagnose that, there’s a good chance we can get you to something stable without changing tools entirely.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’m happy to take a closer look at your Cloud account with our team. Please dm me with your details so I can get back to you on official Airbyte channels.",

Even though your old systems are completely shut off, the legacy data still remains accessible for audit-related requirements.\n* **Security**: Your obsolete systems are often vulnerable to numerous security threats which can compromise your entire IT infrastructure. By decommissioning legacy systems, you can ensure that your existing infrastructure is secure and protected from any unwanted breach.\n* **Sustainability goals**: By downsizing your old system, you can significantly reduce the energy consumption required to run the obsolete systems, contributing to your organisation's sustainability targets. \n\nApart from these significant advantages, another important factor to keep in mind is that you can also outsource your **legacy** system **decommissioning** requirements to a professional expert.

That, to me, is the real problem, not whether one language, like Python, is the best choice or not when you are starting out.\n\nI've begun lots of videos that have promised to teach me, I don't know, Terraform in two hours only to become bored out of my skull in 15 minutes because the teaching is terrible (mainly because IT people generally do not know how to teach, because they don't know how to communicate) and to move on to watching videos of Rottweiler puppies for three hours straight.\n\nThere's a reason why documentation can be awful. It's because many people who know how to do IT-type stuff are incredibly good at doing those kinds of things. What they are generally terrible at is communication, for example explaining how some library or other works.\n\nGood succinct explanations would make even the most difficult technology accessible to all. \n\nThink about Amazon Web Services. When I started to look into it a few years ago I became really depressed because I thought I had suddenly become stupid. It was almost impenetrable. Now that I know something about it I find myself asking, \"Would it really hurt AWS to write just a few pages – just two, for crying out aloud – that tells beginners what the hell the whole thing is about?\"\n\nI have just bought a book on Terraform. It's good but only because I already know about Terraform. Documentation is similar. Too much of it is written by people who think that everyone understands things already. In which case, why do they bother writing the documentation in the first place?",

Messing around with computers, experimenting with viruses (at one point my laptop was full of malware), camping our computer classroom during secondary/high school studies - all of that was interesting for me. So, I went for a degree and I never regret it. Started Bachelor studies when being 28. Graduated when being 32, and then followed it up with Master studies in Cyber security. And working as a junior software developer at the same time.\n\nSelf-study will not take you far. You do not know what you do not know but what you should know. While in a university professors know what you should know and make you to study it. Even when you do not like it. Yes, you can google \"X roadmap\" or something but this only touches the main topics not tells what exactly you have to learn in it. You can also pick some online bootcamp course, but this only teaches you the very basics that usually is not enough to get hired.\n\nWith self study your portfolio will be much more generic. You'll be copying the tutorials you are following, writing meaningless calculators. While university studies will introduce you into much more complex topics and also will give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects. Either as part of your course studies, as part of hackathons, part of the computer club or robotics club or such that you might join, or as your Bachelor thesis project. \n\nAlso, you'll learn all the theory that comes handy later on. Online tutorials and bootcamps show you how to write a functioning simple prototype but they do not tell you why to do it the way you are doing. And often they leave out all kinds of things that will be needed during your work as a software developer.\n\nAnd then there are connections. All your course mates, professors, computer club mates, they can later on help you with finding a job. Most of your course mates graduate and get hired. Some of the professors already are working in different companies while also part time being lecturers in a university. People can give you referrals. You'll get none of that as a self-learner. \n\nNow, to the downside of doing these studies: you won't be able to study full time and work full time at the same time. Either your studies will stretch over to 4-6 years, to lower your study load, or you'll have to lower your work load. I was working with 50% load and studying full time. And I run out of all the free time. Sometimes my flatmates (I shared an apartment with other students) found me sleeping in the middle of my notebooks. I feel into sleep while studying. \n\nAlso, it can cost for you. Where I am from, university studies are free for our citizens. Well, free as long as you are passing your exams and not failing some course. Retaking a course will cost. But in other countries it can be that the studies fully cost money. \n\nI will put it so: how will you stand out as a self-learner from the crowd of university graduates, vocational school graduates, and junior developers changing their company? Why a company should hire a self-learner over a guy who has a degree? If you can figure it out for yourself, then sure, go with a self-study. But if you do not have a strong plan to have an advantage over degree holders, then go for a degree.",

Translating tech talk to something simple so that stakeholders can understand is essential. You don’t need to be super techy to be a BA, you need to be organized, communicate clearly, and able to move the “needle-over” on projects consistently. Not saying this is an Easy job whatsoever, but it is fulfilling and can be learned. Data Analyst make data digestible to stakeholders so that they can make informed business decisions. Good luck",

One activity of that work is programming (writing the actual code that accomplishes the task), but there is a lot more involved such as understanding requirements, and design. It turns out that if we just start coding from our heads we inevitably run into problems so there are strategies and best practices that aim to reduce the likelihood of things going badly.\n\nRegarding job prospects software developers often have degrees in either discipline and in many ways they end up overlapping so it doesn't matter too much which one you pick, what matters is that you put in a lot of effort to actually become good at your job.",

Did you omit it for the format because of time/space constraints?\n- You claim \"don't learn SQL like it's 2010\", but then never use any features post SQL'99. From skipping through I didn't see a single CTE, window function, recursive query, lateral join, json data, tree data, vector data or generalised indexes. This is really basic stuff. Sure, it's not an SQL course but a database design course - but these features are capabilities of databases nowadays that can be used.\n- you seem to do this implementation agnostic, but some stuff here is highly database dependent. Postgres does not have a tinyint type, text data behaves very differently on MySQL vs Postgres. Of course that can't be fully addressed in these videos, but with a full video on string types to wave this away as \"text may be better on any length\" is... weird.\n- ~~same with date types, a datatype introduction there should have timezones in it.~~ - nvm, it does mention it in the constraints video\n- NULL algebra is relegated to one of the last chapters it seems, but it's a gigantic footgun.

I focus heavily on entities, relationships, cardinalities, constraints, and conceptual/logic design. Because of that, relational algebra, window functions, etc aren't core to the curriculum for this class.\n* I also intentionally keep the SQL examples **implementation-agnostic**. If all you want to learn is vendor differences, you need to look elsewhere.\n* For the data types videos, the goal is to give beginners enough intuition to make reasonable design decisions, not to provide an exhaustive catalog of every nuance across engines.\n* As for NULL semantics, that topic *is* included, but it shows up later because students need some conceptual grounding first. By the time they get there, they’re ready for a deeper discussion of null traps.\n* As for \"A table is used to represent a single entity\", it helps beginners learn in the 1st lesson. Nuances like junction tables are inappropriate in the 1st lesson, and are covered as the course progresses.\n\nThese choices are mainly for pacing and approachability, especially for students encountering databases for the first time. That said, your points about relational algebra and modern SQL features are fair for someone looking for a different style of course, and I appreciate you raising them.",

        "body": "A team from our company and teams from two other companies are working together on one large project. We do reviews in a rotation: team A, team B, team C, team A... We have noticed how one team had started producing visibly worse PRs recently. With stuff that clearly comes from an AI: needless comments, helper methods that make no sense, deleted parts of unit tests / integration tests, unnecessary visibility modifications (making a method public when it has absolutely no reason to be public), using full-path dependencies in a code (instead of using \"import this.is.some.package.dependency\" they use it as \"var this.is.some.package.dependency = some value or initialization\", etc. Stuff that serves no purpose or is even dangerous (deleting functionality to \"fix\" tests).\n\nWe have just rejected such PRs when the PR makes no sense. If it is a small code smell or such, we let them change it. If it is a nonsense, then we reject it and tell to rewrite the code. \"IDK\" is not acceptable answer to comments that we add.\n\nThere have been also some complaints that we do not accept such PRs and the task stays unfinished because of taking too much time in the code review phase. But then we just escalated our concerns to our managers. It is their responsibility to talk with the managers of other teams for them to deal with their developers. Inside our team we do use AI tools but we also share both pros and cons with each other to teach the whole team to not fully rely on an AI and to not permit AI-generated code that does not first pass the review/criticism of the developer himself. \n\nWe also are using SonarQube tool for checking some of the more common mistakes in coding style and such. The person who is pushing his PR has to fix these findings before even forwarding the PR to somebody for a review. We will not consider a PR that has unfixed findings from SonarQube and from one vulnerability check scanner.\n\nAlso, the PR has to have a good test coverage (measured by another tool). Adding a feature without tests that verify its functionality, that also is not an option. The coverage % will drop and is visible from the PR.\n\nI'd say that first talk with these bad actors. If talking does not work then escalate it to your manager. And just reject such PRs / do not approve these. Set merge rules to prohibit a merge without an approval. So they can't even sneak pass your unapproved review.",

I've worked with plenty of indie teams of the latter, and the skill/experience level of the programmers that you find in those are very low. It's usually someone who just started learning game dev after watching a tutorial video on YouTube. Sometimes, you find someone who already knows how to code because they're a CS major in college or something. It's almost never an actual experienced programmer, because they're usually not out and about looking for unpaid or rev-share work. \n\nIt's one of the main reasons why I stopped working with other programmers on projects. I can code the game by myself, and I team up with artists, composers, etc., to cover the skills I'm not good at. Finding a good programmer out in the wild is like finding a needle in a haystack, and the bad ones just slow down the team. Even when someone says they have several years of experience, you have to take it with a grain of salt. I worked for a studio with a dev whose LinkedIn showed 3 years of game dev experience, but he didn't understand the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. He wrote a path finding algorithm that took 3-7 seconds instead of the 40 milliseconds it should have taken after I fixed the bug. The bug? The GetNeighbors function was iterating over every tile in the game board (several thousand of them) to find the neighboring tiles each time it was called, instead of simply retrieving a stored list of neighbors or using a constant time method like adding/subtracting 1 to the X, Y, Z coordinates.  \n\nIf your studio is actually paying people, your studio needs to re-evaluate what they're paying for. If it's a team of volunteers, just let go of the unskilled programmers.\n\nI also hope that your studio isn't trying to build a MMORPG that's supposed to have thousands of players all in the same server interacting with each other in real-time or something along that line. If the project is over scoped to a degree that's challenging even for AAA studios, it's very unlikely that your studio will succeed with a team of volunteers who have no obligation to stay on the project. I've seen plenty of those from the numerous \"idea guys\" that frequent the collaboration channels on game dev Discord servers.",

Tone back the anxiety and dread and allow yourself to rest a little, making bits of progress. Follow their request. Be more communicative. \n\n\nIf you were there for that long, they likely won't be firing you if you maintain a positive attitude, check in more, and ask for advice. \n\n\nIn fact, you could probably slow your progress to an absolute crawl, but they might not care if you're really great to be around and look as if you're working hard.\n\n\n.\n\n\nDon't devolve yourself into a puddle of stress and anxiety. When you talk to your boss, don't have every conversation be about how stressed you are, how you're feeling down, etc. \n\n\nInstead, hold it in and be chipper. Instead of, \"I'm so stressed I don't know what to do can you help me?\", ask \"hey, I got done with that task you gave me! Am I progressing alright? If you need to me to speed it up, I'll be right on it!\"\n\n\nIf they tell you're great with some little nitpick, don't speed up and stress. Thank them for the feedback and maybe throw in a nice comment or two. \n\n\nIf they say you can pick up the pace a little, don't speed up and stress. Instead, \"Got it! I'll get right to it! Do you have any advice for me to help me along, perhaps something to focus in on?\"\n\n\nThey might give advice or direct you to your coworkers.  \n\n\nWhen you talk to your coworkers, don't be down, sad, and anxious. Let them know, \"man, I've been making so much progress but that imposter syndrome is vicious. You ever get that feeling?\" \n\n\nIf they're open to it, ask them what they've done to overcome it and how they progressed. You can spin negative things in a positive light through tone, word choice, and body language. \n\n\nYou can also throw in, \"I finished that one task, for some reason it was an absolute doozy! Still. I'm sorry for getting in a bit late. Would you have some advice for being more effective next time?\" to whoever assigns the task. They may already say it via their response, but you can also slip in a question about their expectations for the time frame and how to speed up your workflow to match it.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nStop judging yourself based on your own inflated metrics. Don't judge yourself on other people's behalf. Let them determine whether you're making good progress (like your boss said) or not.\n\n\nAs long as you actively *show* people you're improving, then they'll be lenient towards you. You don't show them by sitting in a corner by yourself stressing. You actively talk to them, keep it positive, don't reveal how seriously stressed you've been, and slowly open *them* up for advice and help. See what they're feeling, their thoughts, and their processes. Ask for their advice on your current work, your plans for progress, etc. Don't overwhelm them, but give them little bits to bite at while you're allowing them to speak a lot about themselves and their work/feelings. Make sure to let them know how great their advice was after you've implemented it.\n\n\nIf you present yourself as a good listener, pleasant to talk to, open to feedback, and always seeking advice, even if your progress is a small fraction of the speed it is now, people will *feel* like you're working harder than ever before, even with missing tasks dates. That's the beauty of perception. ",

If necessary then participate in the next team event and just have either one on one talk or one on X talk. Either sit down with them in a sauna and just sit in that hot place and talk with everybody. Or, if you are drinking alcohol then drink with others. Or something else. Point being: be in a relaxing environment and just talk with people as fellow people not as your team mates. Talking helps. Little ranting helps. They will tell you how they see it. Just bond with your team not grow distanced of everybody.\n\nBut coming back to your work then it is absolutely normal that you won't be on the same level as everybody else after being a junior just for 5 months. Forget comparing yourself with mid-level or senior-level developers. They are mid and senior because they have a whole lot of more experience, knowledge and skills. And they gained it with time. They also were juniors once. They also were slow, once. And even there is no point to compare yourself with other juniors. Every junior has a different past. Some juniors got a degree. Do you have a degree or you have a diploma or neither? Some juniors participated in computer clubs and such, during their studies. Some have been coding since a kid/teenager because their parents were in the IT field.\n\nCompare yourself only with the past you. Did you learn anything new during the sprint (or, if your team is not using sprints then during last week/month)? If you did, then well done. You are only competing with yourself. Not with others.\n\nAsk your boss if the time estimate in these tasks is taking you into consideration or the time estimate is how majority of the team members should be able to finish it in time. Let's say the time estimate is 3 days. Is this 3 days what your team mates should be able to do it in given time or is this 3 days also what a fresh junior should handle? Ask him what will happen when you deliver your task one or two days later. Depending on a project it can be that nothing happens. Some projects are quite agile. Client is fine with waiting some days more. Other are public sector projects where the government and ministries are setting fixed deadlines that can't be changed. Perhaps you delivering your stuff one or two days later, as a new junior, is totally fine. YOU must talk with your boss over this.\n\nYou are not expected to work off the clock. This can give wrong idea to the boss. Perhaps they should put more days or story points to the estimate when going over the tasks in the backlog. But when you are working at the night or something then they will not see this (unless you push your stuff, then pipelines will leave a mark behind). Work 8 hours a day. For the better or for the worse. You doing overhours WILL start affecting the quality of your tasks. Right now you are freaking out over a bug. The next time you might blow up their test environment or something. Because of being too tired, from working more than 8 hours. Stop working more. Get rest.\n\nBugs happen. This is why QA and/or developers testing the product exist. Even mids and sometimes senior developers have a bug in their code, a missed business case. Or a client asks something to be changed. You have to write tests to your functionality. Then test locally. Then test in your team's testing environment (if it exists). And after that pass it on to your team mates (QA or just other developers). They will do a code review and will do the testing. It is a normal process flow. Especially as it was a small bug. That is fine.\n\nYour boss is right. You must communicate more. If you are stuck then ask for help. Tell what you tried, what did not work out, where do you think the issue is (or where it is not). And people will help you out then. If you feel that you are running out of hours then talk with your boss. It is his job to ask more hours from the client or re-prioritize tasks. But when you are not communicating with your team and with your boss, then nobody can help you.",

It is not even close to being the same.\n\nTreat it as a learning experience and understand that preparing for technical interviews is very very different. Remember that interviews are intentionally designed to expose what you *don't* now. Good interviewers rarely focus on what you *do* know. Interviewing is a skill and you should definitely focus on it if those skills are weak.\n\nI would actually argue that with these concepts.. the theoretical foundations have to be there, yes, but how it's applied in real world scenarios is far more important. The edge cases, the pragmatic approaches.. the theory only goes so far. And the only thing that matters here is experience. You won't really understand hashing until you've screwed it up. You only really understand securing an API until there you cause an unauthed API incident, etc. Having text book theory about all of these with no real world use is actually worse. Best to be honest and say, \"I don't understand the inner workings entirely, but this is how I have used it, and this is what I learned, found interesting, found tricky..\"\n\nThe other thing you nailed, was your understanding about your communication style. You need to develop clear, concise, confident, vocabulary about these concepts, it has to be second nature.\n\nOf course, any seasoned dev can google/stackoverflow/llm the answers and patch something together in a real job context. But can they think and speak on the spot and come up with a clear approach to a complex problem?  Interviewers look for \"architectural sense\". Are they just slapping ideas together, or can they actually build and piece together a system, that works? Can they document and write a spec, without help?\n\nYour ability to communicate ideas, problems, solutions, and tradeoffs, as a dev is more important than your ability to code. Maybe not at first when you're getting started, but certainly in mid career, and late career, it's everything.\n\nThere are plenty of resources and courses online to learn about just about everything. It needs to become an obsession on your part, to consume as much knowledge as you can AND then apply it in personal projects, over and over again, from scratch, from frameworks, from everything, until the skills are cemented. It's brutally tough, I get it. There's so much to learn and specialize into.\n\nBut in this job market and hiring climate, only the obsessed, people who truly love this stuff, will make it. There is no room for casuals anymore. The bar is so much higher than it was a decade ago, but there is also ten times more resources/avenues for learning/getting started.",

Study them enough to describe them, compare them, know their differences and what each one is usually better at.

Why don't they just rewrite the code in a new language.\n\nHere are some reasons why not\n\n* The code is extremely large\n* No one knows how the code works fully\n* The code isn't commented\n\nWhen you have a million lines of code that has been tested and debugged, and you're asked to recreate its behavior, how do you do it? Not all code is written well. Some of it is pretty crappy. But it still functions. \n\nYou can also lose intent. Why does this code do what it does? What was the business logic behind this case or that case?\n\nMost programming is on existing code. Rewrites are generally quite uncommon. Writing completely new code is rather uncommon too.\n\nFor example, a lot of AI programming is being done in Python. Because there are communities using Python, there's not a great push to move that to, say, Rust or Gleam.\n\nYou fall into the trap many beginners fall into. You think a language is obsolete because one person says it's so. You look at the newest, shiniest language, even though few people have adopted it because you think one day, it will become popular. Yet languages like C++, Java, C# are still widely used.\n\nIt's not a problem to learn something a bit more obscure like Rust, but it does limit the jobs you can get, and you have to be better than typical to get a job.",

You have 8 years working experience, in managing, leading, delivering, not only digital products, but people - devs, ux, all of the entire end to end lifecycle of designing and delivering a product. Not to mention the soft skills that come with it. Communication, team work, resolving conflicts, Senior stakeholder management.\n\nYou will be more desirable to a hiring manager, than a graduate with none of these skills, nor experience.\n\nI had a similar background to you, 15 years working in digital. Knowing web management like the back of my hand.\n\nIn my experience, when I finished the bootcamp - there were two types of hiring managers I experienced. 1) Those who just wanted coding monkeys and were not interested in my professional experience and just saw me as a junior dev, with no coding experience. 2) And those who saw I was well polished working professional, with solid experience in the industry and web, who could fit in easily because of this, with ADDITIONAL technical skills aka coding.\n\nI would say most of the people who interviewed me, valued my prior experience and saw it as valuable. My first salary offer as a dev after the bootcamp was £50k. Only for the reason, I was a junior dev WITH already strong industry experience.\n\nYour only blocker right now, is the economy. It’s awful for all devs, especially juniors. However, you’re CV is still going to like strong for the reasons above. You’re also young.\n\nGo for it. Don’t let the negative comments put you off.",

        "body": "I got into software engineering in my 40s, with no college or connections in the industry, and coming from a radically different sector (brick and mortar retail). ngl it's definitely hard mode getting your \\*first\\* job, but after that first one you're basically indistinguishable from any other candidate.\n\nMy journey in a nutshell: I was a self-taught programmer who'd never met another software engineer in my life. I quit my old job to move to a major tech hub (this was before I had kids -- it would be much harder to do this now) because, you know, you should go where the money is. And by \"move\" I mean \"sleep on the floor of the one guy I know in this city\".\n\nI was very quickly disabused of the notion I'd get hired as a software engineer because 1) I had absolutely no worthwhile experience to speak of, and no one is hiring you off a portfolio.\\[0\\] 2) I was objectively unqualified, which I can now say with the benefit of hindsight. I wasn't competent enough to understand how actually incompetent I was.\n\nAfter sleeping on my friend's floor for a scary six months of unemployment and failing to get hired as a software engineer, I changed my approach from \"What can I do to get someone to hire me as a software engineer?\" (because that clearly wasn't working) to \"What can I do to get on a path that will allow me to take meaningful steps toward my goal?\" and this basically unlocked everything for me.\n\nI made lists of what I deemed the \"right\" companies to facilitate my growth. These were:\n\n1. Companies that were smallish but definitely growing. Successful startups or just post-startup-phase companies. Places like this, you're going to get asked to flex out of your zone all the time, and internal mobility is very high relative to the Googles or Metas of the world.\n2. Companies where software engineering was in the DNA of the company: whether it was a strong engineering brand, or the customers were engineers. I wanted to become a software engineer, so I wanted a place that had software engineering top of mind (ie not like, a photo-sharing app or dog-walking-as-a-service or whatever).\n\nAnd I guess (3): a place where my past background might be at least slightly relevant, to leverage in some way the value of my past life.\n\nAnd from there I made it my goal to get \\*any\\* role in one of those companies. I would have taken a role in the kitchen.\n\nI got hired as a non-technical customer support agent at what was the dream company on my list. And I spent the next few years proving to them that I am awesome and capable of bigger and better things, and after a few years transitioned internally to a software engineering role, which I would have ABSOLUTELY NOT ever been considered for as an external candidate, largely because I was not competent to do the job. It's much, much easier to become competent while you're inside the house. When you're on the outside, you're largely flying blind and it's very very easy to waste energy. Inside, you will get \\*precise\\* intelligence about what you need to succeed.\n\nAnd I've been here ever since. Dream job.\n\n\\[0\\] unless it's literally insane or you are some major tech influencer / Techerati Twitter / library-maintaining celebrity / etc",

I had done courses and written projects, but were talking a website for a darts leader board (no auth or devops or security) and a heap of courses basically reordering arrays and finding numbers who’s sqrt is a prime in On. Really nothing helpful.\nMy task was to convert this massive test class in to a proper mocked unit test. I had never heard of mocking until that point.\n\nBut what do you do? I failed that task before I moved on to another and eventually figured out how to read debug logs and just got on with it. \n\nFast forward 6 years, I’m pretty solid with what I do. I know what I don’t know, where to seek advice and just follow the KISS principle. Break everything down in to small manageable tasks.\n\nAnd those memes where people say “don’t touch this code because it works and no one knows how/why” are bullshit. You don’t know how it works, figure it out. Debug, logging etc - there’s no magic.",

Either way, it sounds like you may want to drop physics if it's not *strictly* required by your program. I know it wasn't for mine. If it's a hard requirement, then try a better reviewed professor.\n\n>Idk if this degree even worth it? I’m paying a lot of money for it and for what?\n\nThis one is a weird one. It's 100% worth it money-wise for those who make it in the field. There aren't *recent* statistics on this, but I'm willing to bet 50% or more of CS grads are making it into the field. \n\n>To have my mental health destroyed\n\nYour mental health is most important. Nothing is worth degrading your mental wellness to the point of considering s\\*\\*cide.\n\n>Like I feel so much happier when I just learn on my own and not having to worry about the test and be able to do it on my own pace.\n\nI mean, a viable option is changing to a different, \"related\" major, and simply learning CS on your own.\n\n>At the same time I know I’m not gonna be the first nor the last student to ever fail a class but still maybe college wasn’t the right call for me after all.\n\nYeah, no one expects college to be so hard to the point of failing a class (or more). What you're feeling is 100% natural. Just remember that everyone that's good at XYZ, was really bad at it for a really long time.",

But the good thing is, this moment will pass. If you genuinely are interested in tech, just keep on pushing, it’ll be worth the effort. if there’s a simmer of hope to pass the test, study as hard as possible to pass it. worst case scenario, you have to retake the class but you now know everything in all future exams. \n\nAs for your career in tech, you have to do side projects and internships. As long as you keep these up, you’ll be fine after graduation. Many graduates lacks experience needed to land a job, which is already over saturated. If you don’t like tech, then you should find what you want to do. since you’re only on your 3nd semester, you still have a bit of freedom to explore while you take all the prerequisite aa classes. \n\nOn the side note, you should have financial aid no? You could also look for jobs in your school like desk help. you could study while getting paid. College isn’t for everyone, there’s different ways to make money. But it is an investment.

If this class isn’t a prerequisite for some other class, you can try your best to pass, and if you don’t then you can schedule to retake it on a semester where you have easier classes. If the professor just isn’t very good, look to see if your university has a partnership with any local community colleges (assuming you’re in the US) and you can usually coordinate taking some courses there and have them transfer. Sometimes you can work with the department academic adviser to propose a replacement course that could potentially fulfill the degree requirements.

And why are we multiplying it with this input value anyway?\n\nOr, in a SQL query, you'll see me doing \"where exists\" to filter, instead of \"where in\" or even just a straight inner join.  But why did I do that?  There's a very good reason for it.\n\nA paragraph for a function, maybe.  But what is the function actually doing, and why is it doing it?  Why this particular way?  What's this early exit for?  Are there requirements and limitations?  What happens when the requirements are missed or a limitation is exceeded?\n\n\"The code tells the story\" is, well, find something you wrote a year ago you haven't touched since.

        "body": "The value of taking notes isn't the note itself, it's having written it in the first place. You are exercising your mind by writing it.\n\nIn the industry, documentation is scarce. The point of you writing your documentation is to get you to think about what you're doing in your homework. You're practicing structured thinking and discipline. It's helping you more than you realize.\n\nThe only reason I write documentation is when I'm publishing an API. Clients rely on accurate documentation when consuming 3rd party code. The documentation is either correct - or it's COMPLETELY DEAD. If your documentation betrays the client, they'll never trust the documentation or the product ever again. You wouldn't, if it were you.\n\nBeyond that, there are design documents that describe system architecture at a high level. This is for internal consumption for my colleagues. I don't rely on my own documentation.\n\nThe last layer of documentation is the source code itself. The program documents itself. Abstraction hides complexity and tells us WHAT - this is the most important; an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. The implementation tells us HOW - and we really don't care. `std::for_each` could be in terms of `for`, `while`, or `goto`, I don't give a fucking shit. Comments in the code tell us WHY, and provides context.\n\nOutside of your class requirements, you never write documentation that tells us what the code tells us. If I see:\n\n    template<typename T>\n    std::span<T>::iterator median(std::span<T>);\n\nI don't need to be told the `median` function computes a median. I need to be told the parameters are a sorted range and the return value is within the range, because I can't express that in code. I need to know the rounding function used, as it's consequential. I don't care how the median is computed, otherwise.\n\nThere are a TON of bad comments, and they should tickle your intuition that something ain't right. The problem with comments that tell me what the code tells me is who is the authority? The code or the comment? This matters when the code and the comment don't agree - which they usually don't. A comment might be a heading, telling us where we are and what the next segment does. We call those \"functions\". Break your code up. Let the compiler elide the calls and composite the function for you. It's a sign your functions are too big.\n\nAnother way comments and documentation warn you of bad code is that the whole thing is bad. Getters and setters - \"Gets the thing\", and \"Sets the thing\". Bad sign. Getters and setters are not OOP, if you're busy learning that, they're an anti-pattern. It's a sign of boilerplate - which there should be none. It's redundant. You have a misunderstanding of applied software engineering, and this code can't be justified when there are equal or superior solutions.\n\nUse bad documentation as a test for code quality. It takes time and practice, and a development of a deep understanding of idioms, paradigms, patterns, and our craft. It'll take years, and you're just starting.",

You end up learning a lot about structuring code, handling events, and keeping big systems organized. Sure, you skip some of the low-level engine guts, but the practical stuff carries over to almost anything. And if you’re messing with something chunky like Unreal, tools like Incredibuild make the whole build-and-iterate loop way less painful.",

You don't need to learn every single thing from all of those areas, or even from a single book. Just being familiar with the core ideas / basics helps a lot. Then slowly study more of those books and topics as time goes by.\n\nBut here are some of the best programming books that were popular already back in the 1990s:\n\n* The Art Of Computer Programming series of books (Donald Knuth)\n* Design Patterns (Gamma, Helm, etc.)\n* Anti Patterns (Brown, Malveau)\n* Refactoring (Martin Fowler)\n* Pragmatic Programmer (Hunt, Thomas)\n* Introduction To Algorithms (Cormen, Leiserson)\n\nThose should get you really far. And the more you test everything you've read and learned from the books, the faster you'll become good at what you do. So don't wait to try out the ideas from those books. Try them out when you're reading, if possible. Pick a project or two and develop them from start to finish. You'll learn tons that way. Only reading doesn't get you very far. You have to design and implement something larger.",

Functions can be given other functions as arguments which makes this quite a bit more powerful than it sounds at first.  \n\nBy all means learn useful OOP, but also learn functional programming concepts.

Start with the basics: encapsulation to hide internals, inheritance for reusing code, polymorphism so methods adapt per class, and abstraction to keep things simple. Go with Python for its clean syntax—check Codecademy's free module or Python docs to build easy classes, say a Car with drive and honk methods. Java's good too if you want stricter rules; Oracle's tutorials are free and solid.\n\nOnce that's down, build projects to make it real,a text RPG with inheriting character classes or a bank app with transaction types. Use Replit for quick setups and GitHub to track and learn from others. Do a couple projects monthly; that's where OOP clicks, not just reading.\n\nFor deeper stuff, grab \"Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design\" for its visual take or \"Clean Code\" for practical tips. freeCodeCamp has interactive sections, Coursera's Java OOP course from Duke is structured well, and YouTube spots like Corey Schafer show examples clearly. Later, skim design patterns like Singleton from the Gang of Four book, but don't rush. You got this.",

I very much recommend that for a -very- deep dive!\n\n  \nIf you are more into data structures than user interfaces, taking a deep dive into the **Collections framework** in Java is another interesting example of using OOP!\n\n  \nAnd of course, there's always the option of building your own game - like e.g. **a simple text adventure**, with objects representing items, rooms and characters, using inheritance and polymorphism to give different items either similar or different attributes, and letting objects communicate, like hitting an enemy with a weapon could happen as the player-object calling a hit-method on the enemy-object with a weapon-object, and the enemy-object then asks the weapon-object how much damage it would inflict, and subtract from its own health. That is another good exercise into understanding how to use Objects to represent entities.",

Their intent would be clearer if they'd called the function `toggleAutoPlay` too.\n\nYou don't need the if statement at all if you use code like this:-\n\n    let intervalId;\n    \n    function startAutoPlay() {\n      intervalId = setInterval(function () {\n          const playerMove = pickComputerMove();\n          playGame(playerMove);\n        }, 1000);\n      document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').innerHTML = 'Stop';\n      document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').onClick = stopAutoPlay;\n    };\n    \n    \n    function stopAutoPlay() {\n      clearInterval(intervalId);\n      document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').innerHTML = 'Auto Play';\n      document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').onClick = startAutoPlay;\n    };\n\nInstead of checking state variables and branching, you just make the click event point to the right code block in the first place,  Personally I'm not a big fan of the choice to put the looping function inline either, there's a lot to be said for a few extra lines of code and the additional clarity.",

In the `else` statement, it stops autoplaying.\n\nWe don't know the state of `isAutoPlaying` at the time someone calls the `autoPlay()` function. It's initialized to `false` but that will change over the course of the app running. `autoPlay()` isn't called immediately. We don't actually see *where* it's called in this code, but my bet is it's tied to a button click event. So when the app starts running, it's `false`, and then the first time `autoPlay()` is called it will call the first branch of the `if` statement and set `isAutoPlaying` to `true`. The next time it's called, `isAutoPlaying` will be `true` and run the `else` branch instead, resetting `isAutoPlaying` to `false` again.\n\nQuick edit: The statement `!isAutoPlaying` doesn't actually change the value of `isAutoPlaying`. The value doesn't change until it's explicitly set with an `=` sign. It's just flipping the value in that one `if` statement.",

There were always questions I had no idea about, even after all those years, or things I simply hadn’t used in a long time and couldn't remember anymore.\n\nSo I started creating my own flashcards, for example for JavaScript, and printing them out. After two or three months of learning in my free time, I knew the answers to all the questions I had prepared. I passed nine out of ten interviews (meaning I answered all their questions), and I think about half of the companies ended up offering me a job.\n\nBased on that positive experience, over a year ago I built an app with flashcards and quizzes for developers to prepare for technical interviews, and now a few thousand people use it. Most flashcards are free (about 70 percent across 30 categories), and the subscription unlocks quizzes, which also help track progress more effectively. Of course, all of this was before AI appeared. Today it is much harder to even get an interview invitation and there are far more candidates applying for each position, so in my opinion it is even more important to be well prepared in order to stand out.\n\nIf you’d like to test your knowledge, let me know.

        "body": "The short answer is as obvious as it is unhelpful: Experience and training. \n\nThe long asnwer is: Every single one of us started out this way. The reason I (for example) can read documentation now, is that I have mental models ready. Just yesterday I had to read the cods for a linear algebra crate in rust, and for a database ORM (also in rust). Reading those today feels familiar, and I can anticipate where I am going. I know most of the terms used, I have done the relevant math manually and programmed it before. Everything fits into the models I have built in my brain neatly. \n\nComparing this to when I first started writing ray tracers at university: I just passed linear algebra, and had no pracical experience. Everytime I read an unfamiliar word, I had to go back, and refresh my memory of that specific thing. \"How does XYZ relate to ABC again?\". The more unfamiliar words, concepts and language features you have to keep in your head, the harder it will always be for you to read documentation, or to plan and write complex code. \n\nThere are basically two ways to learn this stuff: Theoretical and Practical. \n\nTheoretical covers stuff like lectures, and classes, but also online courses, reading a book or a tutorial. This can help you gain information a lot faster, since it is (hopefully) well structured and presented in a proper way to learn. \n\n Practical is things like coding, but also exercises you would do for class or for a course (or in a book). This will solidify the knowledge you gained from the theoretical part. It also forms shortcuts in your brain. After you have build the third backed with APIs, you will instantly know what to do when you start your fourth. You will have a folder structure figured out, some patterns you want to use, and how to name the endpoints. This is the type of knowledge you only get by implementing the same concept repeatadly, you cannot really get this from theory alone (and people who only got this from theory alone most often have really weird, and mostly impactical, solutions to certain problems)",

It was called the MSDN Library.\n\nMicrosoft would pay their technical writers' large amounts of money to produce highly accurate technical documentation.\n\nThose roles are now gone, as technical documentation now comes down to reading the source code or battling through autogenerated documentation.\n\nBut the lack of high-quality documentation is missed, at least by me.",

That's why we made better CAPTCHAs. When the best OCR could outperform the worst human, we changed techniques. Pick the stop sign. Solve the math problem. Slide the puzzle piece. These all got defeated in their own way. It didn't remotely require \"AI\" in the buzzword context we use it today.\n\nThe modern ubiquitous reCAPTCHA - owned by Google - is more focused on behavioral scoring than solving a challenge. You won't get specific details on how it works, that's by design. Security through obscurity is still important.\n\nMimicking imprecise human input is not exactly difficult, and still doesn't require \"AI\". From what I understand reCAPTCHA is as much about browser fingerprinting, IP reputation, web history, logged in Google account and many other signals, as it is about checking if the mouse shakes while you move it. Cloudflare does something similar. These signals are relatively easy to defeat at the individual level, but harder to scale. Which is really what most websites care about - not a couple bots creating accounts, but a troll farm creating hundreds.\n\nGoogle constantly improves detection with machine learning. Google doesn't publish the efficacy of reCAPTCHA. They may not even have accurate figures themselves, because identifying real world bots is exactly the problem. [Independent research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12108) suggests reCAPTCHA v3 may be the most effective CAPTCHA and highly accurate. If your project requires a greater degree of confidence to prevent automated abuse, you should look at alternatives to CAPTCHA, eg. ID checks or payment details. I'm pretty sure every alternative has much more friction than CAPTCHAs, which is why they're largely still used.",

Most users have a surplus of compute available at any given moment, but that extra cost adds up quickly for bots.\n\nFor example, lets use factorization as this compute. The server can take a list of prime numbers, and select 'n' random prime numbers from that list (repeats allowed), quickly compute the product and send it to the client. The client then needs to factor the product into it's prime factors and send those back to the server, which is a lot more work than computing the product.\n\nThe tricky part there is finding hard enough problems to meaningfully deter bots, but not force users on potato (crappy) computers off your site.",

UNIX pros will have no trouble typing the above command, but after a few times of using it they will probably start to hate it. New users, of course, will be lost trying to type the above.\n\nImagine your program worked like this instead:\n\n    ./my_awesome_program -o my_output.txt my_input.txt\n\nIn general, that's much easier to use, for newbs and pros alike. But of course you'll have to write at minimum some code for processing the arguments (see Python's argparse, for example), and code for opening input files, opening output files, checking for errors, etc. However, such code is definitely reusable across projects, though, so once you've written it once, you can and should reuse it in many different such command-line tools, not only to prevent code rewriting, but also to enforce \"consistency\" in your CLI apps.\n\nBTW, even for programs that accept input parameters by naming files, it's a popular convention to also allow an option to read from standard input. This is particularly useful if the input the user wants to process comes from another file. Typically this option is called \"-\":\n\n    ./some_other_program_that_produces_output | ./my_awesome_program -o out.txt -\n\nSo in that way of calling the program, the output goes to out.txt, and the input comes from standard input (specified by the - argument for the filename), which we can see comes from some other program (but your program should not know nor care about that). Python's argparse may have an option and/or example for handling this as well (see the manual).",

As another person said, if you really, really need a mobile app that you download and install from your phone's app store, you can use Apache Cordova after you built the mobile website and just plug your existing website code (HTML, CSS  JavaScript) into Apache Cordova.

Windows likes to track every tiny thing during install, and random background stuff can ruin the package. a throwaway VM cuts down on the chaos.\n2. package through a build pipeline instead of the “wizard” tool the interactive MSIX Packaging Tool is notorious for unpredictable results. using the command line or Visual Studio packaging is less painful once you get it set up.\n3. run the analyzer early the MSIX Packaging Tool has a validation pass before signing and uploading. running that more often can help catch the filename issues before you get deep into the workflow.\n4. use the Windows App Cert Kit often it gives clearer errors than the packaging tool itself. not perfect, but better than “something somewhere is wrong, good luck.”\n5. don’t be afraid to lean on the store submission support they actually respond and can look at what the logs are trying (and failing) to tell you.\n\nnone of that makes the tool magically good, but it gives you a bit more control over the chaos.",

But the more mutable state you have the more bug-prone you inherently are and the harder it is actually parallelize your program, not to mention that people are undisciplined and leak internal state everywhere anyway…\n\nAnd as the video you saw points out OOP=Inheritance+Encapsulation. And inheritance is in general kinda pointless… Composition is better mechanism of abstraction and parametric polymorphism/parametric types (think of C++ templates) are way better way of code reuse, there has been at-least million PLT texts written on this topic, they aren’t that hard to find either. So that’s why in lot of people say that OOP is essentially just a method of encapsulation.\n\nAlso as someone in this thread pointed out, everybody defines OOP bit differently, for what’s it worth I recently saw this definition and kinda liked it: ”compile-time hierarchy of encapsulation that matches the domain model”",

        "body": "Object Oriented Programming is based on an ideology, whereas Functional Programming is based on mathematical principles. I'll tell you right now that FP is consistently smaller, faster, easier to maintain, and scales better than OOP. You REALLY should focus on FP.\n\nThe principles of OOP do not cause OOP, they come out of OOP as a consequence. So you can use abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance as standalone idioms, or in other paradigms - Functional Programming has all these things, too - and you can still completely miss OOP.\n\nOOP is all about message passing. It's also known as the Actor Model of computation, which you might want to read up on. There's an old tome called Theory of Objects you might want to track down and read, you might want to Google Alan Kay and Carl Hewitt. You might also benefit from dabbling in Smalltalk for a bit - Squeak is a modern implementation.\n\n---\n\nIn OOP - you send messages to objects, and the objects decide ENTIRELY how to handle that message.\n\nYou do not call `car.accelerate();`, you instead create a message, \"I wanna go faster\", and you pass that to the driver, and the driver decides what to do with that. MAYBE they accelerate the car, maybe they maintain a more consistent speed by moving to a less busy lane, maybe they take a shorter route, maybe they're already doing everything they can and have to ignore you.\n\nJava doesn't have a message passing interface like Smalltalk an C++ do, but you can build something - make a `Producer` and `Consumer`, both derived from `Runnable`, that share a `Message` queue. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level construct. In C++, it's standard streams.\n\nYou are giving the object - the actor, autonomy and agency. You are not giving up control. You don't need to command the object what to do and when to do it; it's your object - you built it, you designed it, you've just relocated WHAT and WHEN to somewhere else in your design - when you construct the object. Want a more aggressive driver? Give it more aggressive characteristics as a part of it's construction parameters. Now when you pass it messages, you know it will drive as predictably as you have prescribed.\n\nObjects have no public interface beyond the message passing interface, maybe some necessary boilerplate per your language. You don't GET or SET anything - members are implementation details. You don't push or pull information, you can send it messages with new information, or you can submit a question or query and maybe get a response. Normally objects are constructed in terms of other objects. A car that is accelerated - you don't QUERY the car for the speed, the transmission sends a message to the speedometer, which could be a text output, it could be a widget, an analog device, a HUD...\n\nSo in OOP, you assemble this graph structure of objects as your nodes and message channels as your edges. Your inputs are a source, a monitor, a motor controller, a log file... These are sinks. Things in the middle of the graph can be both sources and sinks - you can make objects that produce their own messages, consume messages, and produce other messages as a response. Perhaps a motor controller is producing heat, speed and power consumption on its own, but also responds to control inputs to speed up or slow down, and acknowledges it received the request.\n\nI dunno, use your imagination.\n\nOOP is GREAT for graph theory, which means it's great for distributed systems. Bjarne invented C++ because he wanted to build network simulators (could have just done it with a matrix - linear algebra is great for solving for networks), but its performance is quite damningly limited. It's ability to scale is also limited - you can scale your graph horizontally all you want, but eventually the size of the network becomes the most limiting factor and you can't get additional performance.\n\nYou can abstract any problem into the OOP domain. That doesn't mean it's a good fit. You can make a text character an object and pass it a message asking it to capitalize itself. This is how Smalltalk works, since everything is an object. But consider the overhead... OOP, Smalltalk presumed a smart compiler, an investment in the paradigm could make the object oriented nature compile out, leaving optimal machine code behind. I don't suppose that's flawed, but it would be an investment in this unique programming paradigm. You're basically trying to get the paradigm out of the way so you can get back down to the lambda calculus formula of computation that the program should actually be.\n\nSo in any of these languages, you can create User Defined Types, as classes certainly are, but that doesn't make them object oriented. Without that autonomous agency, without message passing, it's just more imperative programming, where you're taking direct, explicit control of what happens, when and where.\n\nAnd think about it, once you have an object that accepts messages - you have abstraction aka complexity hiding; you don't know how the object is implemented and you don't care so long as it behaves as it should in lieu of the message. You have encapsulation, which is that bundling of state and functions, aka you can build it internally in terms of stateful behavior. You have polymorphism, which is the ability to interchange any object for any other and they each decide what a message means to them. And you have inheritance, which is an implementation detail, but gives you type hierarchies for when that is sometimes useful.\n\nYou weren't TRYING for any of that, but you get it for free.",

The front end's entire existence is built upon what your back end provides it. You will need to make available what the front end needs, which often involves knowing a decent amount about front end development. \n\nE.g. You're working with a server-rendered app and the front end suddenly needs some back end data globally available. You *could* create an endpoint and have the front end devs request the data from the back end when the JS runs. But... you just sent the page to the client, and it's a single context, right? So you could just render some JS into the page to define some global data, avoiding the unnecessary round trip, and tell front end devs they have the data already. (I'm not saying this matters per se, just an example of some knowledge of front end helping you make a back end decision. There might be reasons you *want* an endpoint instead).",

If you understand the tools that the UI has access to and the trade offs that different UI decisions have, that’s much more important than being able to center a div. I don’t care if a backend dev knows the intricacies of flex box or what browsers css-grid works in, they should know that giving the UI a huge garbled mess, and telling them to just sort and filter it all out in the UI, that’s not only a jerk thing to do, it’s MUCH slower to do almost any of that in a browser on a 5 year old phone than to just do it on the server (could also be a vulnerability based on what it is).\n\nAs another person said however: if you do have to make a change in the UI, you should know what you’re doing, within reason. If you don’t know what you’re doing, you may screw things up and make the other devs mad at you and please don’t do that. You’re supposed to be a team. If you need help, always ask. If your team isn’t helpful (for any reason other than lack of expertise), they aren’t a very good team.",

Something like that makes it easy to update and edit the content without changing any code. There are thousands of free templates and plug-ins that let you make pretty nice looking sites with Wordpress, or you can customize it yourself with HTML and CSS without writing the whole thing from scratch, or even hire someone to build your template but edit the content yourself.\n\nNow if you find it fun to build the HTML by yourself that's great!

Always an element of awkward timing with things like this. Maybe the external service should be idempotent so that it can be notified again without causing issue. If we don't control that, then depending on how we know that the external service has been notified (e.g. response, webhook etc.) we could enqueue the state update then, which retries until it succeeds. Or we could hold open and append to a write-ahead log which is usually very fast, then reconcile later. All sorts of possibilities.\n\nI haven't seen the setup of course, but my thinking was that the previous (Received?) state + presence of a state update task in the job queue (which can only happen on receipt of confirmation of notification from the external service) is enough info not to re-send the notification, else the state change has succeeded so you wouldn't anyway. A separate flag or an extra state could be used too. Definitely no need for \"sub\" states (within states).",

They don't have to be technical just any human willing to engage with you. Demo what you did and explain it, the pressure from this should force you to know the material well and the questions they ask may provoke new areas of inquiry you didn't think of. having someone ask questions also forces you to examine the things you think you know, do you really know it ? or just feel like you do.\n\nif you just need to memorize pure data for tests or things to just know you can combat the forgetting curve with spaced repetition.   \n  \ngood luck! and try to have fun with it :)",

That's great and it's what you need to do but it won't make you an athlete in 2 months. It'll just set you on the right path. Just keep doing what you're doing and maybe add some practice material but things that will challenge you. Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python by Al Sweigart is an excellent choice as well as sites such as Exercism, and lastly you can simply ask an AI to give you some projects to do. Don't cheat with it because that will defeat the whole purpose but they're very good at giving you things that will match up with your skills. Show it what you've been studying and ask it for a project for you to practice on.",

Start with just addition and subtraction. If you get an input of X + Y or X - Y, calculate that. Then add in multiplication and division, and associated priorities. How would you handle A + B * C vs. A * B + C? How would PEMDAS work for these cases, and how can you implement the rules so that PEMDAS works?

Most beginners get stuck because they jump from syntax straight into “real projects” without actually learning how to think through problems yet.\n\nWhat helped me early on was treating it like leveling in a game. First, get comfortable solving tiny problems on your own, not with speed, just with clarity. Things like loops, conditions, arrays, and functions should feel boring before you move on. Once that foundation stops feeling heavy, start recreating small tools you already understand: a calculator, a todo list, a simple CLI game, anything where the logic is familiar. That’s where your brain starts connecting the dots between “writing code” and “building something.”\n\nLeetCode and the competitive stuff makes more sense *after* you’ve built a handful of small projects and can reason through the steps of a problem without panicking. And choosing what to build becomes easier once you’ve stumbled through a few mini-projects and noticed what feels fun to you vs. what frustrates you.\n\nYou're not behind....you’re just at the stage where the real learning starts. Keep the momentum and focus on understanding, not rushing. The speed comes later.",

They don't care.\n\nOne way would be to review their code and to ask questions about their code. Try to understand. Get them to react. As long as you keep a positive learning attitude, this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nLet's mention the \"good code\" part. What is good code? Code that works? Code that achieve high quality? Medium quality? Where do we draw the line here? The threshold is set by the reviewer/company. This is an idea. For some good code is just what works. For other there needs to be tests. For others it requires maintainability.\n\nWe have a bunch of best practices and guidelines to follow to help you do better code (solid, dry, kiss, DDD, hexa/clean...). A lot of opinions on what works and what don't. And knowing what fits or not is generally a matter of experience more than knowledge.\n\nNow, if people at your company are not helping you in any way, I doubt you can think of yourself as an intern (whatever the title). An intern must be managed and led by someone. So if you ask questions and don't get answers, get ignored and such... You are solo. So make the most for yourself.",

Use that function in other functions. You don't WANT to store a whole lot of logic in your working memory. You want to reduce the amount of logic you need to think about at one time by creating fewer, fatter units of logic that you can think about instead.",

During my first master's degree, I noticed that I had lost my ability to manipulate things in my mind and got back to chess for that reason. It improved significantly for things outside of chess. I'm not saying you should start practicing calculation in chess, I'm just saying that this is trainable, so it will come over time.  \n\n> My workaround is to comment the hell out of everything, for example \"// 'r' now contains a pointer to 'rects_' from rect_packer which has x, y, h, w, etc. data\" because even though it's so obvious at the time when I come back to it in a couple hours or a couple days I have to click through all the files again just to re-understand what is doing what.   \n\nYou should have better variable name then. The variable, function and method names should ideally be clear enough that you can read the code and understand what it does, what each thing contains.  \n\n> To hopefully improve this ability I'm working on the Trachtenberg method and doing 3x3 digit multiplication which seriously over clocks my mental CPU but I can manage, however I'm not sure if there is something better I can do to improve the \"concurrent logic buffer\" size in my head.   \n\nI don't know this method nor its goal. But if you are doing it just for the reasons mentioned in this topic, it's a waste of time imo.  \n- Be more dilligent with your variable names and code structure. Do not hesitate to break down things into smaller functions that you reuse (one benefit of a very small function is that you can wrap a few lines of code into a single function call. That function name can then be explicit about what that part does, making the whole code more readable).  \n- Things will come with practice. Don't think of yourself as unable, or dumb, or whatever. It will come, just keep practicing and learning and doing, make your own life easy when you can (for example, good variable names, again, is a way to make your life easy).

When you say you look up documentation for JavaScript, are you talking about looking up DOM APIs like addEventListener, querySelectorAll, and so on? None of those are actually part of JavaScript, they're part of the web platform which has tens of thousands of JavaScript APIs. Or if you're on the backend then you've got the thousands of APIs in Node.js, Express.js, and whatever else you're using on the server side.\n\nSo if your JS code is using the web platform or Node.js but your C program is \"pure C\" that just reads and writes files, for example, then it's not a fair comparison.\n\nI'll bet that if you write C code for a Linux kernel driver, or a GTK+ or Win32 GUI application, for example, you'd look up documentation just as much as when you write JavaScript.",

And secondly it was far to passive for my taste. I learn far quicker by hacking on stuff and referencing docs than I do listening to someone talk.\n\nBut then I was already pretty experienced at that point, and I could filter out the stuff that I already knew from other languages and frameworks while focusing on what was new to me. If \"everything\" was new then I could imagine videos would be more helpful.\n\nAlso everyone is different so I guess my only real advice is throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.",

But plenty of companies, across all industries, are still in need of quality devs.\n\nAnd don’t overlook the small/mid-size local businesses, there’s WAY less competition and they’d kill for your skillset. Less pressure to perform means you can just chill there & upskill until a more exciting opportunity arises.\n\nYou don’t have to follow any those recs, find whatever path suits you.

I actually see it as something of a badge of honor and a sign that you’re a good person (I know I’m patting myself on the back by saying that). Many get trapped in a filter bubble and think everyone loves tech and they’re doing something special for the world. It’s almost kind of cult like. People who become skeptical of tech usually have broader social circles I’ve noticed. Many of my friends have burned out from tech in the past few years and had to discover themselves. Even those still working in tech seem broadly indifferent \n\nI’d recommend getting a job at a medium sized company making a very practical product. Basically something you can explain to a non technical stranger with a quick sentence. “I make an app for selling movie tickets” or something. It tends to feel a lot less tech-y than “I work at the latest AI startup making cloud infra for machine learning” or whatever buzzwords",

They begin profit maxxing and cost cutting\n5. Around this time, the veterans from step 2 start to get pushed out or move on \n6. Business people squeeze the last dollar out of the product and everyone just kinda hates it now. It’s stale\n7. Business people get frustrated as they can’t make money. They leave. \n8.

But their job is also incredibly easy to have done anywhere else in the world and the rest of the world now has reasonably talented programmers unlike a few years ago where there was a significant skill gap in most cases. As such why would you ever pay someone 160k or something like that, when you could pay 15/hr instead? Its basic math. Do I think US based SEs will start having to be paid 15/hr?

As these titles are in the IC track.   \n  \nThis can be important because if you say you want to be an architect or staff title but are talking about management you may be sending mixed messages to gatekeepers. I was surprised about your post title and then the contents of your post weren't about jobs that are commonly thought of as being management. They may think you don't know what you want. Or worse they may think you aren't experienced enough to know the difference and set your application to the side.\n\n\\> my manager keeps saying i'm \"operating at the next level\" but when i apply for staff or principal engineer roles, either internally or externally, i hit a wall.\n\nYou will have to be honest with yourself here as we can't evaluate you. But if you are struggling in the behavioral and system design rounds it doesn't sound like you are there. You shouldn't be struggling at all in a behavioral at any of the titles you've expressed. Those titles have a lot of coordination with other stakeholders and you should be able to breeze through them for those titles. Likewise system design is also a fundamental task for those titles. If you are struggling then that may mean you haven't worked on complex enough tasks for them to feel comfortable hiring you with that title. Yes interviewing is a different skill, but it's just as important for getting the job. Yes sometimes the interview is harder than the actual job.\n\nIf you have skip level meetings I'd highly encourage you to talk to your manager's manager about getting specific with what \"strategic thinking\", \"broader impact\" and \"working on communication\" means to them. Strategic thinking to me would be forward thinking about the feature not just how it's used right now but how will it be used in the future, should it be architected a little differently so we can get future wins for free. You may already be doing this, and what you really need to work on is how people perceive you. If you aren't explaining your thought process to your boss then he may not realize that you are doing \"strategic thinking\". You should be doing this in 1 on 1s.   \n  \nSometimes using the phrases they care about can work too. I know it sounds dumb but when they are filling out a review and you've been consistently talking about strategy for a project to make sure it has impact can go a long way. Broader impact tends to mean impacting multiple departments. If you are already doing that it might be code for you getting more visibility within those departments when you work in projects that impact them. That could be scheduling meetings to ensure the technical requirements will fulfill their needs. Yes product is usually involved here, but product isn't technical and may not make optimal choices.\n\nIt should also be noted in some companies they have to have a business need for the title you want to be promoted into. You simply operating at that level isn't enough justification.\n\nLastly, the market is utter garbage right now. You are competing against a lot of other people. Some of those people have been laid off from major companies. You really need to stand out.",

It’s a topic that is very challenging to offer “general” advice on.\n\nIf you haven’t read Will Larson’s book on the topic, I highly recommend it:\n\nhttps://staffeng.com/book/\n\nSuggest your current manager read it as well. It may help the conversations to be less “vague”. Frankly, if your manager is unwilling to read the book, or any book on the topic, it’s very unlikely you will find an internal staff+ position.

We've basically hit the point of diminishing returns for the everyday consumer and for business use of LLMs and GPT systems.\n\n\nWith that in mind, I can't predict the future, but for the time being, LLMs and GPT systems are *a convenient excuse* for the layoffs required in the post-COVID recession conditions. Businesses don't like to scare their shareholders and stakeholders by saying \"the market sucks and we shrunk\", so they spin it as \"we adopted AI, so the 40% reduction in forces is actually 40% efficiency!!!\" LLMs and GPT systems also took off right when crypto startups needed an exit plan and a way to unload *thousands* of GPUs.\n\n\nSo you'll need to prepare to job-hunt in a very large recession, and the AI / ML sector is currently experiencing a hype bubble. Obviously, some of that hype is totally valid -- they are fantastic at classification problems that don't have formalized training sets. But, a lot of the hype is business people and end users not quite understanding the shell game going on. And there's plenty of grifting because people think they'll be able to sell their \"bottle imp\" before it's too late. LLMs and GPT systems will remain, and they're *really* cool.

And when you do, **have a backup plan because juniors are the first staff to be laid off when money gets tight**. Don't be too proud to find part-time jobs to pay the bills for the year or two finding CS jobs can take in a competitive market.",

        "body": "My thoughts on the situation are that AI is kind of a magnifier of what was already becoming an issue in the CS world even before AI. There really hasn't been anything new in the software world (outside of Gen AI) in quite a while, and what has been done before is quickly becoming so saturated, that there's not a whole lot of reason to make more of it. Software has eaten the world, but it turns out the world was not as big of a meal as what was once thought.\n\nFor example, you see posts like \"wow Gemini 3 can make a threejs game!\" or \"look at this fancy UI GPT-5 made!\" and they are for sure impressive if you are completely unaware of how commonplace it is for people to make stuff like that since well before generative AI took off.\n\nLook at [Deepmind's game examples](https://www.youtube.com/@googledeepmind/playables) on Youtube, you have:\n\n1. A very basic dungeon crawler in threejs\n2. A starfox-like\n3. A subway surfer clone with a pirate theme\n4. Astroids\n5. A space invaders clone\n\nAll of which are impressive if you've never made them and have no clue how to, but none of which are new or innovative. People have no new ideas and AI is exacerbating that issue because if it has been done before, eventually an AI can be trained on the output and imitate it.",

They are nuggets I learned from a lifetime of being in tech and it applies no matter what is going on in the world....\n\n- Be flexible, willing to adapt and always find enjoyment in learning and don't get attached to any tech, job, title, company\n- There is no such thing as a secure job, title, or company no matter the state of the world. Downturns just are more in your face about it. \n- Nothing is permanent. Have a great job? Cool. Enjoy it. It can go away tomorrow. Unemployed? I am so sorry. It sucks. Just keep working on your skills and applying to everything. \n- Luck is a major factor in literally everything. You could be the best specialist in your field and can't find work. You could not tie your shoes and make $500k a year. Just focus on what is with in your control and not how the dice lands when you roll it. \n\nI suppose the other thing is be careful with online reading. Specially this sub. I love it here but also realize negativity and doom get the play here and in the media. We will all get through this one way or another.

Hell, I was.\n\nBut remember, graduating with a CS degree equips you with a tool belt that goes much further than just being able to write some JavaScript. Unfortunately we can’t all be on here posting about how our big name company is giving us 225k a year or whatever. BUT! You are definitely still employable.\n\nTo my new grads out here losing hope: the outlook may be discouraging but the tough people outlast tough times. There is a lot of crazy stuff happening in the world right now that unfortunately does affect the current parameters of your situation, but these are temporary circumstances. Remember, your degree is literally based on problem solving.\n\nMy last suggestion is to open your horizons a bit, which I’m sure you’ve done already. There are a lot of companies that aren’t specifically the “big names” we see here, but are big names in their own industry. This is also how you find some neat niches to grow your specialities in. Right now, you should be open to anything. You just want your foot in the door— any door. Except for doors with red flags. Always run from those. GIS is a really cool industry that never gets talked about on the main stage. Do with that information what you will.\n\nNEVER GIVE UP!",

Yet they keep complaining about a lack of devs and so people train to become junior devs.\n\nSenior wages might be dragged down too eventually as those people who started off earning £20k in 2025 (seriously wtf...) eventually get enough experience to start competing with people earning £80k.

But I understand that’s not even the TC so it’s not really a 1:1 but is there a way to know the min I would be offered without actually seeing the offer?\n\nIt depends on what you're trying to maximize for.  You can absolutely just say \"I won't accept less than $160k\" and filter out opportunities this way... the downside is if they actually were willing to pay $200k you might have unwittingly lowballed yourself (after all, if you're happy with 160, they can just offer you that or a bit more).  But the upside is you don't waste your time if they're actually only willing to pay $120k.  Revealing nothing on your end first lets you maximize the possible offer but at the cost of maybe wasting your time.\n\nIf the range is big you could also ask something like \"what's the difference between a $130k candidate and a $200k candidate?\"  Usually if it's that big it has something to do with leveling.",

Staff and above focus more on why.\n\nAs a staff, it's my job to become deeply intimate and opinionated with the product or platform I am paid to improve, as well my company's technical roadmap. From there, I need to form solid business cases as to what technical work is most important for my team, defend those with SLT or C-suite leadership, and then set up my seniors for success in the execution of that roadmap.\n\nAs a senior, it's your job to become deeply intimate and opinionated on the problem that's put in front of you, likely a project from your staff dev or manager. The business case is already made at that point, and your staff dev has likely proven the case with a poc of some sort, so you need to lead the execution of the solution. \n\nBecome an expert in leading solutions E2E as a senior. Then shadow your staff as much as you can to start understanding their world and responsibilities. \n\nIf I can be frank, going from senior to staff in 1.5 years is extremely tight.

They can't tell what's impressive and what isn't, so they default to assuming it's all entry-level. Mention the most advanced courses, but cut things like \"Computer Science I/II\". A short list of courses that sound more impressive is better.\n\nThe skills section needs serious trimming. That LeetCode level notation doesn't mean anything to most hiring managers. It's not an industry standard, and honestly it reads like you're trying too hard to quantify something that your GitHub and projects should already demonstrate. Same with the soft skills list. Saying you have \"time management\" is meaningless when you could just show it by describing how you delivered a complex medical AI tool with proper NLP pipelines and error detection.\n\nYour language list is creating a credibility problem. Eleven languages including VB and Prolog makes it look like you've dabbled in everything but mastered nothing. Recruiters know that's not realistic for someone graduating in 2026. You'd be better off splitting this into \"proficient\" (languages you've used in substantial projects) and \"familiar\" (things you've learned but haven't built much with). Don't bother listing languages where you're only familar that are unlikely to be relevant for the types of jobs you're pursuing to keep the length reasonable. That honesty will make you look more competent.\n\nThe Task Scheduler project is actively hurting you. Your first two projects demonstrate real engineering thinking; then you list a project whose features are \"arrays, scanners, and conditional statements.\" That's literally week-three CS101 material. Removing it entirely would strengthen your resume by raising the average quality of what you're showing.\n\nYour game project description has a weird gap. You did a great job explaining the design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy), which shows architectural thinking, but you completely forgot to mention what you built it in. Unity with C#? Unreal with C++? Custom engine? The tech stack matters way more to a hiring manager than knowing it was inspired by backrooms-style horror games.\n\nMore generally, every bullet point should pass this test: would a junior developer find this impressive, or would they think \"yeah, that's just normal programming\"? If it's the latter, cut it. Your resume should show the ceiling of what you can do, not document every step of your learning process. \n\nYou'll have a bit more empty space, but that's better than getting mentally downgraded for a bad relevant to irrelevant ratio or preventing the reader's eye from catching the important parts in the 10ish seconds they're going to skim it.",

In terms of direct applications in CS, standard examples include:\n\n1. Determining the numerical sensitivity of an algorithm or function to small floating point perturbations. This would include, notably, numerical linear algebra, which underpins all statistical and machine-learning oriented algorithms.\n2. Optimization algorithms, in which you study how to find the minimum solution to some equation and/or constraints by using calculus. Would be useful in any industrial engineering-type software.\n3. Classical Big-O notation, which describes growth rates as a function of input size. Useful for understanding whether your algorithms are prohibitively expensive when scaled up.\n4. Simulation of physical motion or physical behaviors, as used in computer graphics and visualization, scientific computing, signal processing and other similar physics-oriented domains.\n\nIn summary, I would say that calculus does indeed play a foundational role in the study of many core CS algorithmic domains. Note that these algorithmic domains don't necessarily have a lot of overlap with the kind of work you might do in industry, unless you're working on cutting edge stuff. But nonetheless if we're strictly talking about computer science as an academic subject, then absolutely yes calculus plays a role.\n\nHowever, if you're talking about very specific techniques in calculus like how to compute certain integrals by various substitutions or other random stuff like that, then no, those skills are mostly ways for students to exercise their quantitative and mental reasoning while learning the concepts.",

What matters more is being comfortable with the tools, understanding the concepts, and having a few solid projects that prove you can actually do the work.\n\nThe market is rough right now, so having something structured behind your transition can make a difference. I’m doing a master’s in a tech field for that reason. It’s not required, but it helps add credibility when you’re coming from a non-technical major.\n\nSelf-learning absolutely isn’t a waste of time.

        "body": "It's easy to get into design paralysis early in your career trying to come up with a perfect design. The business stance is that code doesn't have to be pretty, code has to get the job done. And a working project that looks like shit now is pretty much always worth much more than a promised project in the future whose only differentiating feature is that it \"looks better\", \"will be more maintainable\" or \"doesn't carry the same technical debt\" (Spoiler alert, it will carry about the same technical debt.)\n\n\nWant to improve your designs without introducing [YAGNI](https://wiki.c2.com/?YouArentGonnaNeedIt) violations? I've found that [test driven development](https://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment) or at the very least development where you write a method or two in your classes (assuming you're an OO shop) and then write some tests to test them will highlight deficiencies in your design without you designing a bunch of extra stuff you're never going to need. If you find yourself with some down time, you can also go back and write tests for older code if it's possible to do so. A lot of the time older code is heavily coupled and can't really be used outside its existing context, so it can be difficult to do that.\n\n\nIdentifying pain points to fix when you have some refactoring time can also be helpful. You can often clean up a bit around code you're working on without it taking too much more time and without impacting a huge amount of the code base. Incrementally improving quality of the code is a lot easier to pitch to management than throwing the entire code base out and starting from scratch. That's another thing that junior level programmers often want to do, generally before they've even had a chance to understand the code base as a whole.",

At a time when I should be becoming more senior in my career and settling into a company I'm currently left unemployed and having a hard time fighting the feeling of burnout and lack of motivation. AI has slightly compounded those feelings.\n\nI have a good feeling I'll make it through and land an amazing job somewhere that I'll love and grow in but right now being unemployed kind of sucks. I think it's pretty typical for developers to go through layoffs as the field moves pretty quickly and developers need down time to brush up on their skills and stay current but I just can't find the motivation to do that at the moment. \n\nI've been in that six month employment window where you're still being judged by management and your colleagues. If you go into a role burnt out you're not going to make a good impression, in all likelyhood you're probably just going through some type of burnout.\n\nId try as best as you can to get plenty of sleep and go outside for walks, maybe some more rigorous exercise like biking or hiking if you can. Stay away from technology for a few weeks or maybe months and then come back to it with some fresh perspectives.\n\nThis is also why managing your money well as a developer is so important because you never know when you'll need to rely on your savings, it's just a very common thing to be laid off in this profession. Hopefully the market stabilizes soon but who knows what's down the pipeline with the addition of AI",

There are mass layoffs despite wildly successful quarterly results. People are clearly working harder and longer than ever despite AI \"efficiency gains\". In a recent on-site interview, the SVP of the company (a fairly successful series B startup) told me he believes 100% of code will be written by AI. I said maybe 90% just to at least sound like I'm playing along a bit, and said AI need human reviews and verification. He didn't seem to buy that and asked me why he'd trust my code over an AI's code. That left me speechless and not particularly amused.\n\n\nThe whole career just feels hollow now. A few months back I started getting my excitement back and working on some old projects, but now I'm firmly back in the \"eeehhhhhh\" phase. It's just a soul-sucking situation in my opinion.",

It's always good idea to continuously be upskilling wherever you are.",

My FAANG experience is fine and mostly transferrable. It got me interviews at hot companies.\n\nThe problem is that the startup work is basically invisible as long as it stays on the side, and societal pressure makes me feel guilty for not prioritizing the corporate job. If I didn’t have these startups, I’d probably still be grinding interviews and chasing new roles.\n\nBut the truth is I don’t really want another corporate role. It just doesn’t interest me anymore. Maybe when I’m older with kids I’ll feel differently, but right now I want to chase the startup dream. It’s the whole reason I got into this field in the first place, to build cool things that people actually use and maybe build something of my own.",

It could be as simple as you love your work better at startups or maybe it’s just a grass is greener situation. Only you can figure that out \n- Best advice, talk to those in your network on both sides of the coin for perspective. \n\n\nAt the end of the day though if you’re ok with the money part of this and you feel this is your path at this time, it’s certainly a reasonable choice.\n\n\nBut if you want the “odds” version of this, yes, on paper staying at fanng will probably be better for your net worth long term.\n\n\nAlso then again the industry is in such a shift who knows how effective traditional wisdom is going forward 10 years on this .

Make note on weak problems and consider tossing it back to unknown problems. \n\nAs you practice, study and repetition I think are your best bet. Also, with ADHD maybe medication would help?",

He would wait a few weeks if he had to, but of course, he emphasized that he needed me ASAP. Ultimately, I decided I had to look forward and accepted the start date before the bonus payout. My previous employer did end up paying a decent bonus that I missed out on.\n\nI've been at this job for two years now, and in my opinion, there was no actual rush where a few weeks would have mattered, but as soon as I mentioned it to the hiring manager, I realized that it was now a test of my commitment to the new job. In hindsight, I should have just lied and made up some excuse about why I couldn't start until the payout date.\n\nRegardless of the specifics of my experience, my advice is to look forward.",

Maybe that's not a crime, but it felt unprofessional and rushed.\n\nWere the calls important?\n\nIt's a sign of disrespect for your time and life. Nobody calls about business after hours - not without an appointment, or unless something urgent has come up. (There is an argument to be made that not everyone would want to be called at work about their application, but if I'm reading this right you're too young for that?)\n\nThe question you should ask yourself is this: If this is when they are on the clock, what will they expect me to do?\n\n>They originally said there would be three stages: verbal English, technical interview, and then a written English test at the office. I only completed the first two, and they skipped the final step and moved me forward anyway.\n\nYour English seems fine; they might have legitimately decided that if your spoken English was as good as it was, that your written English would be up to par.\n\nI find it far more worrying that 2/3 of the process are focusing on something that should be mostly irrelevant.\n\n>I started as *Software Engineer*. Then later they said I might be placed into front-end. Then they said they do front-end, DevOps, software engineering, etc. and **they** will decide which department I'm going into. They literally told me **\"you have no choice\".**\n\nThat's fair, I suppose. The company has open positions to fill, they decide where they want you to be. You are free to accept or to walk away. Not nearly every company is like google, where they need so many people that there can be a degree of choice, and an entire matching process.\n\nAnd it is not uncommon, especially at the beginning of a career, that they will see strengths and weaknesses in you that might not align with what you imagine yourself doing.\n\nBut rejecting an offer is a perfectly fine choice.\n\n>4. **The salary dropped mid-process.**\n\nThat is outright terrible.\n\nEspecially if they are not certain of the role they are going to offer you.\n\n>They keep mentioning 5-month training period, but they haven't explained what exactly it includes, how it works, or what kind of guarantee (if any) there is afterward.\n\nAnd this is where it starts to sound like a scam to me.\n\nIf they don't have a precise role, how can they have a training program?\n\n>6. **They want my passport, social card, and bank account details before showing a contract.**\n\nI don't know where you're from, and what is usual there. Nobody in what is widely considered \"the western world\" would think that is normal or acceptable. This is where I would start to run for the nearest exist - but maybe you live in some dystopian hell hole where this is what employers do. You have my sympathies.\n\n>Everything combined makes me unsure whether this is normal or a big red flag.\n\nBig red flag. I just can't tell if it says bad things about your country, or just this company. Ask someone local to you.",
