AI/ML over media files is almost always highly parallelized specialized GPU-based compute.  That's expensive.  It makes sense to save the outputs or cache it.  Even retrieving the color would be cheaper to write out as an: image_url, color then re-compute on the fly.  This type of compute is very different from traditional database model of: retrieve off file system via index, store in memory and then compute over a set.  It assumes quick computation over a large set of small things.  Media files tend to be large.  They take up too much space in memory.  They can easily blow up a hard drive.

Fast forward 6 months the data team is still trying to get their complex and brittle near real time analytics engine up and running while folks are asking “where is my data?”\n\nI don’t think it matters how someone defines a “data product” (really who cares?), what matters more is the thought process that you should first identify “why” someone needs something data related and then work backwards in your data stack to deliver the data to them in a format that makes sense (i.e. dashboard, downloadable dataset, or landing bulk data in a bucket/SFTP)\n\nLastly, there have been a handful of times at companies I have worked at where they realized “oh, this isn’t actually a Data Engineering problem but actually something we need to build into our main application.” A lot of times people confound that just because something involves data, it is somehow a Data Engineering problem to solve, not always the case.",

Write slowly changing dimensions, date spines, and window-heavy aggregates - that forces you to master CTEs, recursives, and performance tuning. Hackerrank Advanced SQL and LeetCode’s harder DB questions are solid drills, but nothing matches shipping a mini warehouse: spin up Snowflake’s free tier, pipe data with dbt, visualize in Apache Superset, and wire alerting tests with dbt-expectations. I’ve used Superset and dbt Cloud, and DreamFactory slips in when I want a quick REST layer on top of my practice schemas so a small Flask front end can hammer them with real requests. Building end-to-end projects like this will teach you more about modeling and SQL trade-offs than any static course.",

Run DBT externally in a cloud hosted service, which fully decouples the softwares (good), but then deal with having to manage two services instead of 1 (bad)\n\n\nHonestly I would just recommend orchestrating in DBT cloud. It costs some money per run but probably less than an airflow deployment.\n\nEdit: 2 doesn’t seem that bad now that I’ve written it out.",

When we started there was very little data (and time) and very complex business logic to implemet, so mvs were the quickest solution at the time. We created a bunch of them and we refresh them daily in Airflow. If I would have know the company will develop as it develops, I would start with dbt right away. But I didnt, so I would have used mvs again - they have their advantages.\n\nThat beign said, drawbacks of the mv (postgres edition, some drawbacks may vary in Oracle, tho they both use plsql):\n* when you refresh data it always has exclusive lock - you can't even select during refresh time\n* it fast become time consuming. And you can't natively refresh only part of the Data, you either need to refresh all of it, or create duplicated code to simulate 'partitions' \n* become very resource consuming. At peak, our main mv refreshed 4 hours, during night. If I refresh it during the day it sometimes timesout because of lack of the resources (I put the same query in dbt and some how it managed resources much better)\n* it's easy to add just another column.

The challenge is to ensure that when your visualization tool fires off its queries it can actually use the view. When the tool needs e.g. an aggregation level the view can not provide it may fall back on querying the underlying tables. So it can be finicky to setup and maintain as requirements change. It's also not useful if the user wants frequent updates of the data during the day.\n\nWhenever running into performance issues, the first step is to analyze queries plans and optimize by indexing, partitioning etc. Another issue is typically that many visualization tools pull in everything at the lowest grain level (individual transactions) while 90% of the visuals only need aggregated data. So then create aggregates on the db and use these instead. Only query on the lowest detail level when the user drills down into a specific subset of data and then make sure the data is indexed or partitioned along the attributes on which the subset is filtered.",

Sometimes I would stumble on the answer I needed in the results or the actual link I was looking for somewhere buried in the comments 3 links in and apply it as needed. But for the past several years that's become less and less useful as (I assume) the [SEO](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide) has trended more towards people treating search engines like people, so I've started needing to do the same. Now my questions are more like \"*How do I add X onto Y?\" + \"\"Z language\"\"*.\n\nGoing to something like W3schools.com and looking through the functions by language/category and applying them to the situation at hand step-by-step until I get what I needed has always worked, though it's obviously more effort than a single result giving you a ready-made answer. So has watching videos related to the subject I'm trying to resolve.\n\nSo.. I guess my advice is to change your search patterns to be more like natural language (and utilize [advanced search engine options like flags](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/) to filter out bad results), look for \"beginner\" type sites to help narrow down your search criteria (or expand it if needed), and try to include keywords that will help you find examples.

Since ur a solo engineer, you want a way to onboard new tables, databases, or sources into the datalake quickly and avoid becoming a bottleneck. If you have solid experience with DLT and can make it dynamic thats a great place to start. \nIf not then it might be worth looking into Airbyte its straightforward to set up, and makes adding new ingestions really simple. \n\nThat way you’ll have more time to focus on building transformations using dbt/sqlmesh, and spend the effort understanding the data to make it consumable and valuable to others. \n\nAs a quick win to get something in place fast, you could use Airbyte to ingest data, then build procedures inside the database and schedule them using SQL Server Agent to run a few times a day. Its a simple and reliable setup that works well for most common data sources.\n\nIf come across cases where the source needs more customization or a different approach, you can handle those separately using Airflow.\n\nWhile this setup is running, it’s a good time to step back and explore what tools and designs best match your longterm use cases،، before fully committing to a specific stack.",

(dlt supports pipeline secrets as environment variables).\n\nWe built an internal library that collects a few commonly used functions, one of them is to fetch pipeline secrets from the keyvault - so developers just need to make sure to store the secret as valid JSON - and it's good to go.",

How the source and destination management should be handled in this case? Cause this is something that I don't fully understand and I feel that dlthub documentation is not helping... Is there a way to create a central \"repo\" for all the sources and destinations? And then just call the resource I need? Because now I'm doing it in each task I do in Airflow:\n\n    @task\n    def some_etl():\n      source = get_mssql_source(conn_name=\"xxx\", tables=[\"yyy\"])\n      target = get_mssql_destination(conn_name=\"zzz\")\n      pipeline = dlt.pipeline(\n        \n    pipeline_name\n    =\"ingest_something\",\n        \n    destination\n    =target,\n        \n    dataset_name\n    =\"xyz\",\n      )\n    \n    pipeline.run(source)\n\nget\\_mssql\\_source and get\\_mssql\\_destinaton are my custom functions which are getting the credentials from the Airflow connections and creating the sql\\_database and mssql objects in dlt.

Do expand your toolset over time and if you can, but do not focus on the tool as such. Instead focus on solving the problem at hand with the tool(s) available, as effectively and efficiently as possible. Also keep in mind someone else will eventually pick up where you left off, so document what you've done in an accessible way.\n\n3) know and paint the bigger picture for yourself and others to understand more easily what is going on. This helps you to do a better job and explain what you are doing, but it also helps others to understand and match their skills to the task at hand. \n\nIf you focus on these 3 abilities, you can work in any company of any size. Your experience in some tools, like Databricks, counts of course, yet less so because you know the tool technically, more so because you know how to apply it to the above 3 abilities. Every new tool is just a means to and end. If you can master 1 tool, you can master another one, and another one after that.\n\nTrust yourself. You'll find the right opportunity. Hope this helps.",

        "body": "Hey!\n\nFirst, sorry to hear that. Startups are tricky to get into and until you have been working for a bit, it’s hard to know the right questions to ask to avoid coming in too early.\n\nRegarding what you should do next, I would advise against freelancing. Most companies don’t want to hire freelancers with 10 years of experience as they can simply go with a boutique consulting company. I’m not saying it is impossible, but it is a steep hill to climb and it also sounds like you could benefit working in a team environment and learning from more experienced engineers.\n\nThe top 4 things that will help get the average data engineering job are the following (in this order):\n\n1. SQL\n2. Python\n3. Shell scripting (aka bash)\n4. Data modeling (i.e. fact and dimensional modeling)\n\nOnce you get a good grasp of these, then you layer on whatever are the current popular tech stack tools/platforms like the following (no order):\n\n1. Clouding computing (AWS/Azure) - sounds like you are already good here.\n2. dbt \n3. Snowflake/Databricks\n4. Orchestration (Airflow or Dagster)\n5. Extract Load tools (dltHub, Airbyte, etc.)\n\nThese are going to be your most common tools. While there are things like Spark, Trino, Kafka, etc., not all companies use them so there is limited value in focusing on them.\n\nNext, I’d also pick up good software development tools like:\n\n1. Docker\n2. source control (GitHub)\n3. CI/CD (GitHub Actions)\n4. Infrastructure as Code (i.e. terraform)\n\nThis is quite a bit and I suggest starting at the top of my post and slowly working down. Next, while you can apply to jobs, the entry job market is very strained right now. You need to start networking, ideally in person but if that isn’t feasible then you need to seek out online networking.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions.",

I have found this is the best way to just organically grow your network.\n\nNeither of these approaches are quick as it takes quite a bit of time to build a network and get to the point you connect with someone looking to hire.\n\nI also recommend starting to post on LinkedIn. Doesn’t have to be clickbait, but just show some activity. Regardless of how folks feel about LinkedIn, it is widely used and being active on it helps give you visibility. One thing I recommend to folks is as they are learning/working on things, simply post to LinkedIn.",

It is just a small reward for me, that will cost you nothing. If you don't want to register, it's ok, you can dm me and I am more than happy to send the code to you privately. \n\nEverything has been done with good intentions, and when you diss my hardwork like this, it hurts fyi. \n\nI hope you understand, and I wish you the very best!",

The pains you are encountering are normal, and technology maturity has nothing to do with these.\n\nThere are a few options depending on size of topic and frequency of user requests. If these are low, then I would suggest giving kSQL a try, I believe it is its initial purpose. Otherwise like another redditor said: writing a little spark tool, like a cli with a --sql option can work.\n\nBut keep in mind this is going to deserialize potentially all messages in a topic at a time.\n\nSo if this is too high workload for your laptops, then this is the signal to replicate the data to a system made for data exploration. Your parquet attempts with Kafka connect or Spark are good ones. So keep digging in that direction.\n\nThe ignoring of tombstones is really strange, it's just a null value for a given key, it should propagate. Is it your experience or is this coming from documentation?\n\nThen for the Avro->Parquet with Spark attempt you should not have to use Arrow. Just go from reading the topic (and deserialization) straight to `write.options(...).parquet(...)` \nThere might be some tweaking to allow for dynamic schemas depending on which topic you read, which folder you write to, and some tweaking in the frequency of that job to not write too-small-files\n\nEdit: Additionally:\n\n for Avro to Json with Kafka Connect try and set `value.converter.decimal.format` to `numeric` \n\nthere were a couple of issues like this with Json serde apparently:\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-481%3A+SerDe+Improvements+for+Connect+Decimal+type+in+JSON",

Inventory management, demand forecasting, sales analysis, sentiment analysis of social media comments, etc. Then, think about how you'd model that data. Put together a schema, maybe visualize it with a diagram, and then test it by writing queries against your schema to address the analyses you came up with. If you can write queries against the schema that achieve everything you're trying to do, then it's likely a sufficient schema. If you can't write good SQL against the schema, then rework it.\n\nAnd as a bonus, you can make it as complicated as you want. What if the coffee shop has multiple locations? What are some likely candidates for slowly changing dimensions, and how do you handle them? What if the coffee shop wanted real-time sales analysis to predict demand at 15-minute intervals?\n\nIn my opinion, you don't need a website to give you examples of businesses that need data models unless you want validation that your model is satisfactory. All you need is a walk around town and an analytical mindset.",

You use a group by or windows to only keep the max value, maybe before the join maybe after. This approach scales much further than most people realize, especially with polars.\n\nDoing it this way prevents all the headaches and footguns that come with manually updating slices of pandas dataframes.\n\nIf group bys and joins sound scary or complex, then you're missing the fundamental concepts of data manipulation, and I would strongly recommend brushing up on them.",

That's the best kind of decision-making because 1) you'll be more confident yourself and 2) you can point people to the data if/when they ask why you made the choices you did.\n\nSo what you might do here is set up one dataset with each partitioning scheme, then run a similar query to what you will in production.

The upside of this is that it's a common pattern that most of your customers will understand. The downside is that they have to write code (ie do work) to get the data out. The shape of the data is limited to what you serve over the API. It also puts a bunch of extraneous load on your servers (we've seen APIs be taken down because they were being scraped aggressively for BI purposes).\n* you can let your customers download CSVs. Like the first option, this will take work on your side to support and operationalize. The upside is that it's a pretty well understood pattern. The downside is that your customers might get annoyed quickly because this is a manual process: if they want data with any kind of regularity, they'll have to do this over and over again.\n* you can share data directly to your customer's database or data warehouse. The upside is that the data shows up directly where they're ready to consume it, and they have to do zero work in order to get the data. It's also much more secure than letting them access your database directly (for example, they can't take your database down by accident by putting undue load on it). The downside is that it can be more or less cumbersome for your team to implement, depending on whether you build it in house or use existing tools. If you decide to use tools for this, assuming your data exists in places other than that RDS instance, you can leverage some of the native sharing functionality of some data warehouses (eg Databricks' Delta Sharing, or Snowflake's Data Sharing). Alternatively, you can use a vendor like us ([https://prequel.co](https://prequel.co/)) that will let you write data from your RDS instance directly to your customer's db / warehouse regardless of what stack they run.\n\n*Full transparency: we're a software vendor in this space.*",

Request models and validation are important as they clean massively your back end logic: i.e. you know there is always going to be a user_id key in the request payload and its data type is int.\n\nTake into account requests volume (already mentioned usage plan, also lambda concurrency limit at account level) and speed of response (good queries, database indices, elasitc cache or api gateway cache - for instance) when finalizing details.

The goal is to use cheap table scans and drop the source data into an intermediate temp file for staging. (Parquet or one of its derivative)\n\nMoving data out of the source is sometimes described as creating your \"bronze\" layer.  Personally I think that sounds a little pretentious.  But there is a lot of responsibility involved. You need to know the source, and avoid burying it with unnatural workloads that it was never designed to handle.  In general it should be safe to do table scans on a clustered index in the source database.  Those simple queries should go unnoticed (ideally).\n\nThe next part is loading the data back into a warehouse or lake house.  This is called building your silver layer (at the lowest granularity required).  Basically this work involves reading data back out of the temp files and then loading it into a star schema.\n\nSpark is where the magic happens.\n\nMy preference for all this data movement involves the heavy use of spark.  Microsoft loves spark as much as any other company (besides databricks itself of course). I would learn spark if you aren't familiar. That is where you find as much compute as you need, and is far more important than other decisions you may need to make (like whether to send data to a db, or dwh, or lakehouse... and whether the data will live in fabric or elsewhere)",

        "body": "I'm part of the engineering team behind Synapse Dedicated, Synapse Serverless, and Fabric Warehouse.\n\nSome notes about best practices that will improve your security posture and also ease a potential future Fabric migration you eluded to above. \n* Fabric does not support \"basic auth\", e.g. basic username and password. This is in line with existing best practices in Synapse and elsewhere - use Entra instead, e.g. Managed Identity, Service Principals, et cetera instead. So when setting up logins et cetera in Synapse, I'd suggest following that best practice. Here's a doc on this - whole doc is useful, but I've linked to the section on disabling local Auth: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/active-directory-authentication#disable-local-authentication\n* Ditto on SAS keys and account keys- if you have to, use the user delegated kind. But user passthrough is what we support in both and the modern recommendation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/develop-storage-files-storage-access-control?tabs=user-identity\n* Dedicated can take a fair bit of fine tuning to run at its best. 500 Gb isn't very large by its standards, which is good, but also, means that you're paying its overheads without getting as much out of it. Fabric Warehouse does a much better job that Dedicated did with that sort of volume, generally\n* Depending on your needs, I'd consider Serverless as well. It doesn't require as much tuning to get the best out of it.\n\nHappy to answer questions.\n\nEdit: and just to be very clear, I'd generally strongly advise new development target Fabric over Synapse. Synapse remains Generally Available and supported, but isn't seeing significant feature development. Fabric has a lot of improvements that aren't in Synapse, and continues to get more. But it doesn't sound like that's an option here, so the advice I'm giving here is intended to help you make the best of it, as I think it's important we support our customers regardless of platform. Also, this is my personal opinion, not official advice :).",

In '22 and '23 I saw virtually no enhancements being made in Synapse, and Microsoft started putting banners in that portal to get everyone to move out to Fabric.   That is where they decided to make future investment.  Microsoft loves to rug-pull on their data engineering customers.  Be careful.",

        "body": "Others have pointed towards resources like Splink for solving the technical problem of entity matching. The other problem is non-technical issue of defining requirements and expectations and achieving sign off for the new solution from the business owners.\n\nEntity Matching is never perfect. There will always be trade-offs involved in any solution, and there will be exceptions where valid matches are missed or incorrect matches are made. You should agree with business owners on:\n\n1. Methods for measuring and monitoring data quality. Example: routinely sample N records, analysts inspect and flag any incorrect matches and then produce a % accurate metric.\n2. A process for what happens when there are exceptions (if needed). Example: a defined process for analysts to input overrides in particular cases.\n3. Understand the risks when there are exceptions. Will it impact downstream business processes?\n\nDefining requirements and success criteria up front will make your life easier in the long run as it will help avoid on an ongoing cycle of tweaking rules or ad-hoc \"fixes\" once the process is live.\n\nOnce you have a working solution in development, you will also want to compare the results from the existing process to the new solution. Take a sample of records and  explain any differences. You can present these examples to the business owners to demonstrate why outputs have changed and (hopefully) why the new process is superior.",

It's actually a pretty standard technique in entity resolution. The real issue isn't the approach - it's probably the implementation quality given what you've described.\n\nFor the technical side - before you rebuild everything, try profiling the current pipeline to see where the actual bottlenecks are. Sometimes these \"bad\" codebases have one or two critical performance issues that, once fixed, buy you time to do a proper rewrite. We've seen 10x improvements just from fixing obvious stuff like loading data multiple times or running queries in loops.\n\nFor entity resolution at your scale, you might want to look into:\n\n\\- Splink (open source, handles blocking and matching pretty well)\n\n\\- RecordLinkage library if you're in Python\n\n\\- Even AWS Entity Resolution if you're cloud-native\n\nThe blocking strategy is solid but the devil's in the details. Are they blocking on multiple attributes? Are they handling things like nicknames, abbreviations, different email formats?",

Is this something you'll easily find in the CI or only in the monitoring?\n\nI've been working at a company in the past where the team managing the production system and the analytics system where completely decoupled, thus we were extremely fragile with such changes.",

I absolutely do think this sort of change, like details of a publication, should be part of a CI pipeline, using one of the tools for managing database migrations. Flyway is one I've used with success in the past, lately I found pgroll (https://github.com/xataio/pgroll) and its innovative take very interesting, I don't have hands-on experience with it, though. Postgres can be started up very quickly in a container (it's what we're using for testing Debezium itself, too), so this can easily happen for tests on CI, too.\n\nOn the aspect of changes to a publication and thus a CDC event stream changing its schema, that's a very large topic by itself. In general, the team owning an application and its database should also be in charge of its change event streams and their schemas, evolving them with compatibility in mind, ideally implementing the idea of \"Data Products\", i.e. consciously designed data streams with a well-defined, documented, and stable contract. Stream processing with tools like Flink can be one way for shielding consumers from the impact of upstream schema changes.",

For Oracle, there's this one, for instance: https://gitlab.com/osp-silver/oss/movex-cdc. I'd always recommend log-based CDC if it's available for a given database.",

However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it gives you more control and flexibility over the data pipeline.\n\nYou can use a secondary pipeline (could be DBT or custom scripts) to filter and push only the relevant client data to their lake. This gives you the ability to implement data governance, ensure data quality, and maintain audit trails. Plus, you'll have the flexibility to serve multiple clients from the same source without cross contamination.\n\nYou can implement client specific transformations, add data validation layers, and set up automated monitoring to ensure data freshness and accuracy. The slight complexity of the process pays dividends in maintainability and scalability, especially if you plan to onboard more clients with similar requirements. Also consider if your client has other data sources they'd want integrated, platforms like Windsor.ai excel at selective data extraction from multiple channels with proper tenant isolation, which could create a more comprehensive analytics ecosystem alongside your survey insights.",

Since your platform team is already managing EC2 infrastructure, adding DLT pipelines to your existing Airflow setup is the path of least resistance.\n\nBefore committing to self hosted solutions though, Windsor.ai might solve your cost problem, they handle MySQL → Snowflake with competitive pricing that could bring your 30MMAR spend down.

I suppose this is a fundamental aspect of using columnstore databases, given that updates are computationally expensive.\n\nDatastream converts a CDC stream into batch merges (\"background apply jobs\") when writing to BQ. Each time a background apply job is run, BQ will scan the entire table regardless of the partitioning on the table. But, if you don't need super-frequent updates, you can change the \"max\\_staleness\" setting on the destination table in BQ to limit how frequently background apply jobs run. This should greatly decrease costs if you aren't already doing it:\n\n[https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/change-data-capture#cost-best-practices](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/change-data-capture#cost-best-practices)\n\nAs for setting up your own merge ingestion, the cost of each merge is based on the amount of data scanned in all relevant partitions of the destination table:\n\n[https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/dml-syntax#partitioned\\_tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/dml-syntax#partitioned_tables)\n\nUnless I'm mistaken, this means that the partitioned column has to be included in the merge condition in order for the partitioning strategy to provide any cost-savings benefit. In practice, I found that partitioning on the primary key (or an integer component of it, if it's a composite PK) is the best way to minimize merge costs. \n\nAnd obviously, reducing the frequency of your merge updates will help here as well.",

Pretty sure [continue.dev](http://continue.dev) is producing chunks of like 2 or 3 lines from the doc files.  It performs better if I use DIFY and force just a 1024 char chunk, with 100 char overlap, but even that tends to return the docs header boilerplate fragments, and not specific code that examples or describes the thing I'm asking about.  This may just be a hard use case, where you want to ask \"how do I use this cli tool to build xyz\", and have it not return \"to use cli tool for xyz do the following...\" but instead, grab the example code and list of command line options.   \n\nProbably would be better on a big organization SOP that had clear things like \"policy on internal document encryption is this and that\".  In a nice clean paragraph.  \n\nAnyways, thanks for the tip, I learned something.",

Ramp up on model evaluation, Docker, and CI before worrying about deep-learning theory. Your Snowflake time still counts-fast queries and cost tuning matter when a model calls for thousands of feature lookups per hour. After two-three end-to-end models you’ll know if deep math excites you or if staff-level DE feels better.\n\nI’ve tried Databricks and Vertex AI for this stack, but DreamFactory handled the boring part of auto-spinning REST APIs from Snowflake so the model server could hit features without hand-built Flask.\n\nThe sweet spot is staying close to data while adding ML tooling rather than jumping to executive courses right away.",

You can just read Excel as a CSV and bulk insert into Azure SQL and then do your merge. Why introduce an arbitrary data format and add complications like a whole other platform Databricks when you're probably just dealing with a few hundred rows?\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/import-export/import-data-from-excel-to-sql?view=sql-server-ver17#bulk-insert-command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/import-export/import-data-from-excel-to-sql?view=sql-server-ver17#bulk-insert-command)\n\nThat being said:\n\n* ADLS is *not* NoSQL ... it's a storage layer. Databricks supports reading ADLS Gen 2 - that's where your Delta tables are stored in Azure when using Unity Catalog.\n\n* Not sure what you mean by \"I'm assuming you can't because ... NoSQL\" - Databricks is based on Spark, it will happily read unstructured data in files from your data lake.\n\nAnd while in your specific case you can't do it because you have multiple sheets, *if* your Excel file was just a single sheet you can just read it directly in Databricks SQL\n\n`select * from read_files('/Volumes/my_volume/uploads/test.xlsx', schemaEvolutionMode => 'none')`\n\n(You can use an arbitrary ABFSS location if you provide a credential to Databricks SQL's [data access configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/sql/data-access-configuration) but Volumes are a lot more convenient and easier to manage.)",

It's extremely hard skill to get good at even after years of doing it.\n\n3) Distributed storage and compute (Snowflake, Databricks). \n\n4) Cloud (One cloud provider is more than enough since those skills can be applied across).\n\n5) Little bit of programming.

The tech industry, especially at tier 1 and 2 companies, has gotten brutal about technical assessments, and overselling skills often backfires spectacularly during system design rounds or when they ask you to architect a real-time data pipeline on the spot. The path forward is building genuine DE skills through side projects that demonstrate her understanding of distributed systems, cloud platforms, and modern data stack tools like Airflow, Spark, or Kafka. She should leverage her analyst background as a strength since she understands data quality, business requirements, and analytics workflows better than most engineers transitioning from pure software development.\n\nThe reality is that breaking into tier 1/2 companies as a DE without that exact experience is tough for everyone right now, not just international candidates. She needs to create a portfolio that shows end-to-end data engineering projects, contribute to open source tools, and target companies where her domain expertise as an analyst adds value to the DE role. Internal transfers within her current company or targeting data-heavy startups that value her analytical background might be more realistic stepping stones than jumping straight to FAANG. The interview process for these roles involves complex technical discussions about trade-offs, scalability, and system design that you simply can't fake your way through.\n\nI'm on the team that built [AI interview assistant](http://interviews.chat), and data engineering interviews can throw curveballs about distributed systems and pipeline architecture that really test your depth of knowledge, so having a tool to practice those tricky technical scenarios might help her feel more confident when she does land those interviews.",

But at the same time centralise BI or engineering teams sit outside the business and, having been burned by getting blamed before, want to push the risk and design back to the business as much as possible.\n\n\nSo pretty much every place I've worked has done kind of communications barrier between technical and business but when you get right into it, it's really more about the data side being unwilling or unable to think about the business process and do effective blue sky thinking about how to leverage their talents against a shared problem and pushing the business to become data designers instead and come to them with a spec.\n\n\nI reckon there's definitely some value to be had by getting an AI in the loop somewhere to help translating, but I don't think it attacks the core of why people always have this problem and the model you've described sounds like it's trying to remove the need for data development to understand the business world and problems. I think generally the opposite should hold, which is that data teams who want to only do the tech and not the people work are the problem.\n\n\nNot the worst example of a shitty pitch for yet another data AI tool startup hustle in that you've picked a good problem area, and there'd be an audience for it, but personally I'd give a hard pass to anything selling me the idea that the people problem of business/tech culture clash can be solved with a tech product.",

I’ve had had some success and made a lot of duds when testing and deploying AI/LLM solutions for non or semi-technical SMEs in enterprise orgs, so when I read your idea, I recall a lot of those learnings.\n\nTo me, the communication gap you are looking at is the like, 20% problem that requires 80% of the effort to solve. It’s one of those permutative problems that when solved destroys agility and flexibility of organizations and when pushed all the way in the other direction of giving everyone free reign and no direction can make other orgs look like a barrel of monkeys. \n\nSo all that preface is to say tools that presuppose that you will be able to solve knowledge transfer between more than like 3 layers of a business of how information passes through competency layers (ex in my prev. comment) is a cursed problem. \n\nBecause of that, I see problems with a tool that suggests that a Director can cross 5+ competence layers and genuinely get what they need, because to be completely clear: While data is served at a wide scale to many ICs and SMEs, the general purpose of all data is to help teams inform leaders, because all of that data is meant for those teams to make better decisions, and to then show data of improvement to the leaders. So for a tool to cut across all of this and save money or time or both, you would need to create a tool that solve all of these layers based off of a leader level prompt, which is really hard to do, and I think cost/success% wise outside of scope of existing tech. \n\nWhat I personally see as the clear line path for llm products are places where you can extend a sme 50% of the way in the direction of a couple of other domains that require proficiency and time spent learning. Tools that can take a great manager with ok tech chops, and solve the little simple ad-hoc tasks that you would originally bog down report devs / automation analysts in excel, idk the examples arent always great they are niche and reveal themselves through iteration. \n\nI think that smart LLM practitioners will not try to replace the human in the middle, not because its the right thing to do, but because its the financially prudent and performant thing to do, and they will support SMEs to become more proficient in adjacent domains. More so, at least, than was previously possible or expectable in the past. That will help solve the communication gap (a bit) in these orgs that prevent end to end technical implementations today.\n\nSorry if this was too long! It’s a really interesting topic. I think good historical cues to take are to look at how no-code / low-code tools have started, been hyped, and where they ended up. Sometimes they do pretty good (Power Automate, Zapier), but they never have a “playing field levelling effect” across all layers of an org. Rn a Director could use Power Automate to already pull and transform their own data, but they won’t. \n\nNot to say those loops can’t get better and more accessible, that does seem to be a good use case for LLMs, I just think that it will more often than not require that someone knows something about the field they are using an LLM solution for, even if its an adjacent one (which is the more practical value prop of AI except for OpenAI who get to be the core chatbot, lucky them).",

        "body": "Here's my list of why it's tough to teach yourself.\n\n**Figuring out what to learn**\n\nThis is the number 1 problem. How do you know you are \"learning the basics\"? Which YouTube videos are you watching? There's so much stuff, it's hard to pick. \n\nThere's even a bit of procrastination. Some lay out plans that will take years to complete which means it won't get done. They will add an intro programming courses, maybe discrete math, maybe SQL, maybe operating systems. The fact is, most people never get much past the first course. \n\nLesson: you don't have to plan that far ahead\n\n**Hard to make progress**\n\nIt's tough to motivate yourself. For a handful of people, learning to program is (kind of) fun. For others, it's boring (yet, not easy). You have to learn syntax, e.g., a for-loop in C. You have to learn what you can do with that syntax, e.g., iterate through arrays.\n\n**You fail to learn control flow properly**\n\nIf you're learning a procedure language, or a language that has procedural aspects, like Python, it becomes useful to emulate the computer, going one step at a time. You want to know what happens at every step. This low-level approach helps you understand how your program behaves.\n\nThe human mind often skips steps, making assumptions about what stuff does. This is where it's helpful to learn a debugger, or do the poor man's equivalent and print \"debug\" statements.\n\n**There's not a lot of material on debugging**\n\nAs a beginner, you're likely to write buggy code, ie, code that has mistakes. Fixing those bugs means determining *what* caused the bug, i.e., identifying the bug. Then, *fixing* the bug.\n\nFor as much time as a beginner spends learning material, surprisingly little covers debugging.\n\n**There's a lot of advice**\n\nPerhaps the most common one is \"build projects\". Here's the thinking behind that approach. Beginners sometimes learn from tutorials. However, many tutorials are too advanced for beginners. Worse than that, they tell you *what* to do, but not *why*.\n\nYou might wonder why they don't explain things. After all, don't learners want to learn? Here's the problem. How do you know how much the person watching your tutorial knows? If you can barely program, then you'll spend time talking about programming basics, and the part about building what you're building is now a fraction of the tutorial.\n\nEven if you know programming basics, it's still not enough. For example, you might be following a tutorial on React (not recommended for beginners). It will tell you to do this and that for React, but not the *design* of React. What was the philosophy behind React? Why does it look the way it does (i.e., why Javascript)? Explaining how React does stuff takes time, and tutorials predominantly skip over it, and jump into using it. \n\nThese tutorials fail to show you the big picture. Instead, you're in the weeds (stuck in the minute details).\n\nSome beginners begin jumping from one tutorial to another, building stuff, but not understanding what they are building nor how to change what they are building.\n\nThis leads to the common advice *build a project*. \n\nHere's my beef with that approach. You need to learn basics first. You need to learn basic syntax, control flow. You need a mental model of what the computer is doing. You need basic debugging skills. You need to do small exercises to help you learn, say, for-loops.\n\nThat part, to many, is boring. \n\nThe other complaint I have is you're asked \"find something you're passionate about\". Most beginners have a hard time identifying what they want to build, or they want to build something far too sophisticated, like a 3D game. They struggle with coding tic-tac-toe, and that's far too boring to be fun.\n\nThe analogy I typically give is learning a foreign language. There are two popular approaches. The academic approach teaches it like an English teacher teaches English, i.e., it's about grammar. The other approach is to learn phrases. The second way is meant to avoid long hours of learning a language's grammar so you can take a vacation somewhere and get by with little knowledge of the language.\n\nI liken the second approach to building a project. It only works if the following happen: you have a reasonable sized project (can be hard), you figure out what you need (also, can be hard), you find what you need (also hard). The driving motivation is you're building something you can use. A programming exercise doesn't do that, but I feel it's a necessary prerequisite.\n\nStill, some can manage to learn enough of a language by searching for what they need. But the part they leave out is how they search for what they need. They tell you to build a project, but then no one ever shows you how they build the project. I suspect if they showed the steps, a beginner would say \"but how did you know to do that?\". It requires search skills (or you could capitulate and let the LLM do all the work, but then you're not really learning).\n\n**Staying motivated**\n\nMany beginners burn out. Or they procrastinate and play video games (or something else) or they have family issues that require their time. With no one to motivate you but yourself, many quit after a month or two. It's not fun. It's not easy. The concepts are too hard. It seems like it will take forever to do something simple. There's so much material out there.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nMany things contribute to self-teaching being a challenge.",

But at work, We had an ERP that fed an oracle database with over 20 years of data across multiple departments. It was there I saw all the ways I could use programming to solve my work problems. I went from being an inventory guy to our company sole software developer. \n\nGo on github and find something you care about. Fork it and play with it and think about what you wish it had and start implementing. Failure is key to success. Not AI, not another Python tutorial. Write it yourself by hand until it turns to muscle memory. If you get stuck give yourself some pen and paper and 30 minutes and write down your problem.\n\nYou know you are getting when you start asking Google how to do http request. How to connect to x database. How to wrap and unwrap json. You start asking about real concepts.

I taught intro computer science at university level once upon a time.\n\nThe feeling you are describing happens every semester with just about every student at one particular point in intro programming.\n\nSo, you're not alone ✅.\n\nIn university, it's the point after we teach loops (for and while), arrays, iterating through arrays using loops, and even arrays of different types.\n\nEveryone is happy and everything is great... But then...\n\nOnce we create a \"multi-dimensional array\", ie an array where each element is an array and write a nested loop to iterate through each array, no matter how smoothly I tried to guide students through it (which I always tried new things to build up to it and put significant effort into), just about everyone's' minds break and it's like they suddenly know nothing haha.\n\nSuddenly they can't even write if statements anymore. 🤦‍♂️\n\nIt was a problem I tried to solve so many times, but I couldn't.\n\nMy theory of what happens is the following:\n\nA multi-dimensional array is effectively the first ever ACTUAL \"application\" or \"practical usage\" of computer science.\n\nUp to that point, students learn just raw mechanics (variables, conditions, loops, etc) but don't apply them to anything...\n\nIt's never easy to leave the raw mechanics world and enter the world of applying your mechanics towards real-world problems.\n\nIt's like your first time jumping off the high dive. It's always uncomfortable and challenging! And, that's okay!\n\nIt's when you start to realize that simple logic can get complex quite quickly. Look at the code for binary search - it's extremely short yet profoundly powerful.\n\nMy advice: Put your raw mechanical skills in your toolbox, stop focusing on them, and start using them.\n\nAnd, as always, give yourself grace and enjoy the process! 🙂",

Do not use AI to solve your problems as you won't learn anything (even if you think you did). I had my biggest aha moments when my code didn't work and I spent sometimes hours debugging and understanding why things don't work. The more you struggle, the more you tell your brain this is important, so don't forget it when you eventually solve the problem. The struggle is an important part of the learning process.\nA resource I always recommend because I did it myself is the Odin Project which focuses on web development but also teaches you problem solving. The projects are picked by the skill level you should have if you learned everything prior to the project which is great because then if you cannot do the project, you know that you need to go back and learn the topics which came prior to the project. The resource is open source and created by developers for beginners. You start with projects like Rock paper scissors and end with a full stack social network you need to develop yourself.",

The only way you can describe something good is by intimately going deeper into the types and built in functionalist that are hardware dependant and already exist in the machine you are using.

Don't be afraid to experiment. Play around. Break things. Fix them. Practice, practice, practice, and practice more.\n+ Don't go looking for tutorials for everything. Learn to stand on your own feet. In that line, do a proper fundamentals course and then throw away the training wheels and start building.\n+ Don't give up too quickly. If you get stuck, go away. Take a break. Do something mundane, something with low brain activity. Go for a walk, go to the gym, take a shower, clean up, whatever. Then, often the answer comes by itself or if not, sleep over it.\n+ Don't use AI for anything other than explanations.\n+ Don't put a \"code first\" approach. Code is only the means to tell the computer what we want it to do. The steps before the code, the *algorithms*, the *steps by step solutions* to tasks are what really counts. Sit down with pencil and paper and go through the task. Analyze it. Break it down. Solve it *your* own way, as *you, the person* would do it. Track the steps. Then, once you have a working solution, think about how to *implement* the steps in code. Remember that you can't solve what you don't understand.\n+ Don't be afraid to ask questions. Yet, when asking, demonstrate your efforts in the line of \"I have researched *this*\", \"I have tried to understand *that* but am stuck at *this*\". Don't just ask \"How to do *this*\" as such questions will not be well received.\n+ Make the documentation of the language you are learning your best buddy. Make heavy use of it. Learn to work with it.\n+ Your other best buddy should be good old Dr. Google (or the search engine of your choice)\n+ Expect to be slow. Expect to run against obstacles. That's completely normal when learning. Only those who do not give up and conquer the obstacles (certain stubbornness is necessary here) can succeed.\n+ Do not look at how much you have to learn - it is a mountain that you cannot reach the summit. Look at the path, the steps ahead of you and walk one step after the other. This way, it becomes a lot more manageable and less disheartening.\n+ Be prepared for a lifetime of learning. You will never \"master\" anything. You will become *proficient* and you have to be satisfied with that.\n\n**Edit:** something more\n\n+ Adjust your approach to *failure*. Don't see it as something negative. It is completely normal to fail. See it as *gained experience*. You now know how not to do something. That is more than you knew before you tried it. It is equally important to know how not to do something as to know how to do something. \n\n   I've added this point because way too many people despair, are frustrated, are destroyed as soon as they encounter failure and then, they instantly reconsider their choices or directly give up.",

Also, debugger can help you a lot with understanding how code flow works etc. Similarly, your IDE might make your life much easier, if you spend some time discovering its features\n\n\\- don't just fix effects of issues, but get to the bottom of them; a good programmer shouldn't just sweep issues under the rug (especially issues like regressions) but explains the root cause, so that it does not propagate further. It's a good practice overall and is good for professional development. Going back to previous point - learning how to use some non-obvious features of git, like blame, and integrating them into IDE, can make a world of difference while at it\n\n\\- keep your ego in check; there's much more to be said here, but this is an important one, especially around code reviews. There's two sides of that - one is don't take criticism of your work personally. It's very hard at first and might not be possible at all in some cases, but try to find a way to do it. Second - be kind when commenting others' code. You should point to the issues, but even you're 100% correct to point something out, do your best to use soft language and not make it inflammatory.

Clean Code had a lot of great ideas to course-correct.\n\nHowever, the example code could have been better chosen. A lot of the example code constructs HTML from strings, which was common at the time but seems really dated now because we all use templating libraries for that which are way cleaner and more general-purpose.\n\nIn addition, the book goes into gnarly details of mocking in Java and a lot of that content is totally out-of-date today.\n\nI'd recommend this book instead:\n\nThe Art of Readable Code: Simple and Practical Techniques for Writing Better Code\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Art-Readable-Code-Practical-Techniques/dp/0596802293](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Readable-Code-Practical-Techniques/dp/0596802293)\n\nI think it's designed to be more timeless and applies to lots of different languages and types of code.",

There are some weird sideeffects to everything, and throughout the book he seems to think that sideeffects are okay as long as they happen inside the same object.

I have no problem doing work in functional languages and using those paradigms, but I can certainly see where and how many people would truggle compsred to OO where I more often think \"how can you struggle with this, it's not a hard concept FFS\".\n\nAll in all I would actually prefer to use OO paradigms everywhere and I'm much more comfortable implementing them, but the actual reason I do so less often is that other people struggle so much with OO and we end up having to resort to more functional ones and languages to either appease or even dumb things down for those who just can't get their head around OO design. It's basically a case of getting sick of every time you write a project or codebase using OO patterns, you eventually get some goddanm whiner come along and complain about using OO, and/or they start writing functional code which makes the OO codebase an absolute mess.",

Languages are tools, so limiting people's choices to a single way of doing things makes no sense to me. I personally use whatever I think makes the most sense and is easiest to understand by people reading my code at any given point. Plus I also care about performance so I default to imperative programming because state machines are imperative by definition and thus the nature of imperative code makes it much easier to reason about that particular aspect.",

Hell even displaying information in a console isn't straightforward in functional programming. Read about Monads if you want to know what I mean (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)\n\n\nNow this isn't to say functional languages are bad. They have a lot of applications in science and research  due to the way they enforce consistency, especially when you want to parallelize operations without worrying about shared resources management. it's just that in my opinion, functional programming isn't designed for a lot of enterprise level software that modern software engineers work with.",

        "body": "You're asking more questions than you think. \n\n1.) Tech is extremely competitive. Many factors contribute to this. It used to be that tech seemed such a brain-dead obvious bet for a lucrative career that it seemed foolish *not* to attempt some sort of STEM career. This means that you can have a CS degree, several fullstack apps in your portfolio, and are able to steamroll the LeetCode 150 and not even get interviews. The constant rejection of any job search process is soul sucking, but the energy that goes into the ground level for software development makes the search a really special journey into feelings of worthlessness.\n\n2.) Gaming is the worst part of tech. That's not even discussing the wild freefall the AAA side of the industry is experiencing. The reason is because gaming is a prestige position. No matter what happens, folks like you are gonna say, \"I don't care. I want to make games.\" Because games are awesome. Since the line to work on projects is out the door, management can pay less and work their talent harder. A normal tech job outside of start-ups can give a really good work/life balance, even more so if you land a remote position. That is considerably less likely for a similar position at a gaming company. Call it crunch or \"Bioware magic,\" but those companies you dream of working for know about your dreams, for better or worse. \n\n3.) As game projects increase in scale, distribution of labor gets more distinct. You aren't \"programming a game,\" you're \"responsible for the flow of the inventory system but not the menu system itself or the actual UI of the system.\" This isn't a bad thing. It's just how the sausage is made. But it can take away some of the razzle-dazzle of \"making a game.\" \n\n4.) This is an incredible time to work in a small group or going yolo solo. Unreal Engine is free, and blueprints make it a lot more accessible than raw-dogging C++. Unity is free (but don't use Unity). Godot is free. Phaser3 is free. YouTube U is free. Check out /r/gamedev and r/IndieDev. There are posts on those forums every other day from folks who are further than you in this process asking themselves, \"Am I wasting my time?\" And the answers may be illuminating. \n\n5.) Game dev just isn't something you should be going into for love of the game if you want to make money. If you shift to the most lucrative corners of making games, you will bleed out your love, and if you focus hard on making projects of love, you won't have as much money or as much help (co-workers), and it's an uphill battle to be noticed. Undertale is the exception. Balatro is the exception. Vampire Survivors is the exception. I hope you're an exception.... but you'll probably need a day job or a rich spouse/parent. \n\n6.) Learning to program is worth it as a skill on its own, I truly believe that. I LOVE that I can have an idea, think about how to make it, and just... make it. It's a really, really fun superpower. It was also really hard won. Understanding how all the pipes fit together beneath the user level is incredibly useful. I think everyone should at least learn to build and deploy a CRUD app without AI so they can just understand what the hell is happening. That said, there are other parts of the game industry than programmers or artists, same as there are other paths in \"tech\" besides engineers, bright-eyed founders, and parasitic C-suite villains.",

It took a while for me to get that confidence and that switch of knowing how to actually use what I'm learning and it wasn't really one singular thing, tutorials did kind of help me, and projects DEFINITELY pushed that learning even further, but it was mainly answering programming questions and basically trying to teach everything I learned to someone or something. Obviously I wasn't good at programming, but because I was passionate about the field I would still try to answer programming questions and so I would study the concept and fact-check myself all the time, because I dont want to give the other person wrong information. Basically the Feynmann technique. It works really well for me.\n\n Just simple [rubber duck debugging](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and answering questions helped me go from not understanding how to put new concepts together to being able to write code confidently. Because I was taking my time and explaining everything like I was a teacher and that helped me slow down and understand the benefits and the reasons for some of the concepts I was using like loops and functions, it opened my eyes to what I did and didnt understand. By answering programming questions I also read a lot of code that wasn't mine and that also helped me understand documentation a lot better as well teaching me how to identify good coding practices. As for when I learned to understand it all? I don't know,  it took months and I have no idea when it clicked. I think a lot of it is a gradual process.

This is nowhere near the same thing as taking a course.\n\nWith that said, you could slog through the text books, and then sign up for 1 semester at WGU or some other similar school, pregame a bunch of the outsourced learning when possible, and then test out of everything.  This would get you a CS degree in \"a single semester,\" which basically just means it's a very cost-effective approach if you are disciplined and/or smart enough.\n\nPersonally, I've taken a more organic approach of just pursuing things when I'm interested in them, and always pushing myself to dive deeper in the why behind things.  It takes a lot longer, but is more fun for me.  For instance, I taught myself web dev and explored that for a while, then moved onto lower-level things with C++ by making a game engine.  Now I have dived deeper into embedded systems and learned to program Arm assembly.  This has taught me a lot about logic gates and CPU architecture.  Along the way, I have learned and practiced data structures and algorithms whenever I needed to or felt like it.\n\nNext up is either going to be learning network protocols for IoT stuff, or learning operating system design to create my own RTOS.  Eventually I'll get into database design when I want to, and I think that about covers everything.

Anyway, see the modules and then you can see which direction to go. You can probably also get their reading lists, which are basically enough books to keep any student busy full time. You might even be able to use their libraries or chat to the professors in the department cafe, depending on the place, but you won't get academic tutors etc.\n\nTo a student that's just graduated doing it all on their own without paying is the kind of thing that looks possible in hindsight but is actually a bit insane.\n\nOn a more practical level, do a bit of general learning then focus in on something while learning more about whatever you come across along the way.",

Even worse, only about %30 of employers even view my resume at all! I do think you'll need more than the one project before you start hearing back. It sounds like the project you built is strong, so the other projects can be small, but polished. I'd aim for 2-3 more unless your WhatsApp clone is completely out of this world. \n\n\n\n\nThe main thing I've learned so far while looking, is that breaking in as a self taught dev is going to require lots of networking and people skills. On paper, you have one big reason for people to throw your resume out right away, and with thousands of options that's exactly what they'll do. You're going to need a connection pretty much. You don't need to have one right now, but you're going to need to make one. Whether that be at tech meetups, on linkedIn in, or in real life. \n\n\n\n\nSo my brutally honest answer to your question, if you're young with nothing else making you stand out on your resume except that project, your chances are very very low if you're just cold applying. ",

And some stuff from analysis, linear algebra and trig might also help.\n-  Do you know what is an algorithm? and I mean rigorously, not just a hunch. you need to be able to atleast surface level analyze them to explain them.\n- Do you know how digital electronics operate? You need just some surface level stuff, but again lot of stuff is basically impossible to explain without at-least a bit of understanding.\n\nI would recomend you read some books about the topic, my recomendations are:\n- \"Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs\" by Niklaus Wirth\n- \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" by H. Abelson, G. J. Sussman and J. Sussman.\n\nYou don't have to read them whole (tho I recommned you do), but atleast the first halves or so of each.\n\nGoing through the MIT CS101 MOOC might be worth it as well...\n\nThen you have to pick a language/enviroment and just try to teach them these concepts in it...\nThe interesting options there are:\n- Scratch - Some people think it's great, I think it's difficult to teach some fundamental stuff in it and I think grade 8 student might have already outgrown it... Plus 14 year old me would probably think it's the lamest think ever\n- Flowgorithm - similar to scratch, better at teaching some fundamentals, but more tedious for the students\n- Lua - Lua is imo extremely underated as a teaching language, it's way more powerfull than the above, actually usable in the real world, plus you have a great resource in the \"Lua Reference Manual\" by Roberto Ierusalimschy, you can then throw a in library like LÖVE into the mix and have a great fun enviroment to teach in.\n- Pascal - Pascal is also awesome teaching language, maybe not suitable in your case, but once again way more practical, makes it very easy to teach more advanced concepts, and \"Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs\" uses it for it's examples. Lazarus is really nice modern enviroment to learn pascal in, and once again gives the student way more real world applicable knowledge then something like Scratch.\n- Racket - again great teaching language, you might find it easier to teach if you are particularly mathematically inclined.\n- Python - it is an option, I don't particurarly like it as a teaching language, but there are some great books and is actually very practical in the real world.",

The host name portion of an URL can use a domain name or an IP address to specify a host (which might actually be more than one machine), but each scheme (the first part of the URL, e.g. `https:`, `mailto:`, etc.) has its own rules for interpreting the rest of the URL. For example, the `tel:` scheme is followed by a phone number rather than host name.\n\nThere’s no real difference between accessing a machine via IP or domain name; the sending machine resolves a domain name into an IP address using DNS as part of establishing communication. The actual connection is made using the IP address. So, yes, hacking is also done using IP addresses, but no, that’s not really a basis for hacking — it’s just how internet communication works.",

They work like mailing addresses and just like mailing addresses have nothing to do with whether there’s a locked door or even a building at the site. Also, just as a large building might have an internal mailroom, computers connecting to a local network like your WiFi router will have a local address behind your internet connection’s public one. They usually start with 192.168 or 10.x. These local devices cannot be reached directly unless a forwarding rule of some kind is set up. They can only receive responses to their requests and this affords them a lot of protection from attack. \n\nThe DNS system is an aliasing system. You can buy or really rent with the right to renew a domain like mysite.com from a trusted registrar. They’ll have a portal where you can specify that mysite.com should direct traffic to a certain ip address or forward it to another domain. There are other entries for email addresses using that domain and several options. Browsing to the site involves using DNS to do a destination lookup and then sending traffic to the final ip. This also allows those IPs to change if needed. The second part of this is traffic encryption using a ssl cert the registrar sells you and verifies on the fly. This addresses most DNS breaches other than the authority itself because the traffic recipient must also have a copy of the cert.\n\nNone of this is actually securing your computer. It’s just addressing and impersonation prevention and traffic encryption. That’s more the realm of firewalls that block suspicious traffic and anti malware that disables suspicious programs.",

It's beginner friendly and incredibly versatile. You already know what you want to do and that alone will get you far. I would stick with Python because there is little to no downsides to learning it for programming since it's easy and plus you already bought a course for it. Of course there will never be a perfect option but for learning programming and making desktop apps, Python is fine, especially if performance isn't your main goal. Which I don't believe it should be if you're a complete beginner. Focus on learning Python, as well as important programming and computer science concepts like data structures and algorithms and after that every other language will be a lot easier.",

I'm a Linux sysadmin/engineer who was tasked with migrating 200+ RHEL 7 servers to RHEL 9. The sheer scale and complexity (legacy code, service variations, completely different deployment strategies between versions) made bash scripts impractical. I had to learn Ansible. The pressure drove me to pick it up in a month, become proficient by six months, and complete production migration within the year. Now I use Ansible everywhere. That's automation born from necessity.\n\nMore often though, automation springs from fixing daily annoyances. I hate tracking my hours, so I built an iOS shortcut that logs my ins/outs and generates a weekly spreadsheet for my boss. When I used to distrohop on Linux, I created an Ansible dotfiles repo to streamline setups.\n\nThe key is to identify what genuinely annoys you, then ask \"how would I automate this?\" The search for solutions naturally follows.",

Ideally you should know both.\n\nOne reason is because there's easily 1000x more C++ code out there than Rust code. While people who are starting new projects from scratch might be more likely to use Rust now, most existing C++ projects are not going to rewrite.\n\nEven places that use Rust for all new code use a lot of code written in other languages. Rust programs often call into libraries written in C, C++, and other languages, and sometimes you'll need to read, debug, or modify that code too. So knowing C++ is pretty useful.\n\nAnother reason is that experiencing the flaws of C++ will help Rust make a lot more sense. Rust was designed in particular because it just wasn't possible to write memory-safe code in C++. There's no better way to appreciate that than to try to write C++ and to see how an error can cause your program to crash or corrupt memory, then to experience how Rust prevents that code from even compiling.",

I used to be quite competitive during bachelor's and put a lot of effort into staying ahead, but in the masters, I just realized that having a more nuanced and focused skill set is more productive.

That skill might not be used to the employers but showcase that you are smart.\n\nIn my case, I have a degree in ai, and I got a job offer not because they needed an AI spesielt but because they think that makes me smart(i dont know about that tho 😅).\nSomeone with a deep understanding of a topic that they dont teach in uni will be better prepared for the industry than someone with good leetcode stats.",

How you do algorithms, how you solve problems, how to be efficient, how to have a clean structure and style.  After you learned with your first language you can jump into most other language pretty fast. I started with C++ and when I had to use Phython I read the documentation and boom. You really only need to learn programming once, the languages are just a tool and you switch tools for different purposes.\n\nThat doesn't mean you shouldn't specialize. All languages have their own merrits but the thinking you have to do while writing stays the same. Specializing is something you should think about after learning your first few languages.\n\nAnd honestly with languages like Python there is not much to specialize in. But others like C++ people who are really specialized to that specific language are very valuable to some companies. But we are talking about really expert level technical knowledge of a very complicated language. It is dry and the work isn't very interesting, at least for me.\n\nMy starting recommendations are:\n\n- C++\n\nI started with this one so I am biased and you need to know that you probably won't ever fully grasp everything about this language. It can do everything, it is used for everything, C is the backbone of programming. If you are good at C++ thats a real thing to be proud of and from there on you will tackle every other language. Still very hard and frustrating to learn. Some even start with C and I think thats also a really good starting point. C doesn't offer the same quality of life stuff that C++ does but that just means that tackling the hurdles that language presents really teaches you that \"logic\" that I talked about earlier. Tho I'm not sure how much that will help in real-life since you will most likely use a more user friendly language anyway. I'd say C++ offers almost the same experience while beeing way more beginner friendly.\n\n- Python \n\nIf you have trouble with C++ (wich is totally fine, as I said C++ is a real challenge) Python is amazing. It is fast to learn, it is convenient and most of all Python is really really fun to start with and that is super important while learning. For real don't torture yourself with C++ too much, just switch to Python and try C++ later!\n\n2. What branch?\n\nHonestly just try out a few different things. Maybe there are projects you really want do do yourself. You could get into web development and create a cool website. You could try something simple like making Minecraft Server plugins and hosting a server.",

This will considerably reduce the barrier.\n\nPartly the above paragraph is the reason Harvard's CS50 starts with *Scratch*, a visual programming language designed for children learning programming. It loosely resembles the graphics of \"Nassi-Shneiderman Charts\", another approach to drawing algorithms. This approach helps focusing on the actual *program*, on the *steps* to solve a problem without getting tied up in programming language syntax. Personally, I think that this is a great approach to learning programming - especially in the beginning stage.",

        "body": "When you are first starting, some people find flowcharts easier to understand. They are a graphical representation so it is \"friendly\" in some way. Explaining procedures that involve branching (\"conditions\" in non-techie speak) to non-programmers is also often done with a flowchart and \"not\" pseudocode, by the way. So in some way, flowcharts seem to be naturally are intuitive to all audiences. Personally I think it's due to the uses of little arrows that can point in whichever direction. And I think it's been shown that most humans have a sort of \"spatial memory\" of sorts, so if you're following such a diagram you can think of each box of the logic as a little room in which you are standing. Following another arrow goes to another room, and so on. Also you can add little pictures, colors, etc. to such a digram to make it more fun, if you want.\n\nHowever, when you're actually writing out code, a lot of people don't like to draw that much (at least I don't). If I'm thinking about how to do a problem on a whiteboard, or on paper, then I prefer \"pseudocode\".\n\nOne time I \"do\" prefer a diagram, though, is whenever there's a \"state machine\" in the code, or if I'm implementing a data structure that has a natural graphical or tabular representation (e.g. lists, trees, matrices, etc.). In such a case, I like the graphical representation but I will heavily abbreviate it in writing. But in the code I will use clear labels at each state for maintainability/\"greppability\" purposes.\n\nSo in summary: you should ultimately aim to learn to read/write all forms of these ways of expressing a program. The flowchart and/or pseudocode are intended to be \"programming language\" neutral and to be read by a human. You are supposed to read them and then implement it in a natural way in whatever programming language happens to be your favourite (or the one which you happen to be using).",

It doesn't have to be actual \"problems\", it can be something as simple as creating a program that tells you which day of the week a certain date is - that is solving the problem of \"wanting to know which day of the week a certain date is\".\n\nSo the problems you should work to solve are very much related to the kind of programming you can do and the kind of programming you want to do.\n\nFor me, back when I was learning, it was all about games. Simple board or paper games like **tic-tac-toe** and **solitaire** (where you jump over pins), **hangman** and **rock-paper-scissors**. But also \"action\" games, mostly simple shoot'em'ups where you move a spaceship around and try to shoot or avoid oncoming enemies - and of course 2D 'grid'-games like **sokoban** and various **zelda**\\-clones.\n\nIf you are not into games, and want to write something that runs purely textbased, that can also be fun and simple. Some small projects that I still occasionally enjoy are programs to convert numbers like 123 to words like \"one hundred and twenty three\", or to/from roman numerals. Also just silly little experiments with inputs and branching, like a stupid chat-bot that doesn't really understands what you are writing, but just looks for keywords.\n\nI like to think of it as being creative with LEGO bricks - you have a collection of sets, with instructions, and you've seen how you can use the bricks you have to build those sets. Now if you take all the sets apart, what else could you maybe build with the same bricks? Could you make a spaceship or a western town or a ghost train? Just having some vague idea, and trying to connect bricks will get you a long way - and the cool thing about programming is that you never run out of bricks, but you sometime have to learn just a tiny bit more (add a few more bricks to your collection) to build exactly what you want.\n\nSo start with assessing your collection of \"bricks\" - what kind of problems could you solve with what you have?",

Instead, I decided the approach that would be better is to open the docs, dog through the sample project to see how some things interact, and just dive in.\n\nAfter 3 days (about 45-60min daily) I'm getting an idea of how things interact, and tonight I'm just gonna start coding and see what happens.\n\nTyping this, I've actually learned most things in life this way. Working on cars, doing things around the house. Just have something you can reference to figure out why something works or doesn't work, you can do the rest.",

Put that on a college application or whatever and your genuine hard work and commitment over time and taking it seriously will probably put you a lot farther than most people.

Show up, join a team, and build a solution in 48 hours with your team, and present it to the judges.  \n\nThere are a few benefits of this approach:    \n  \n1) It raises the stakes. Suddenly, you're not just completing an exercise to get some course's Certificate Of Completion. Suddenly, there are prizes involved, and team mates who rely on you (and who you rely on). It makes it much more exciting. As a result, you'll be driven to learn things you wouldn't have expected to, and end up with a richer learning experience.   \n2) It will boost your confidence. You might be competing against people doing PhDs. And you'll suddenly realise that even though you're 14, your project is could still beat theirs (and in some competitions, it will).    \n3) It's the most fun learning environment. The real purpose of going to a hackathon is to learn a new skill. Often, hackathons are sponsored by someone who has invented a new technology of some sort and who wants to promote it among the software community. By doing a hackathon and learning that skill, you become among the first one in your town who gets experience with it, and you find that a few months to a year later, there are job ads for someone who knows that skill (and of course, no applicant does). Knowing the newest technology gives your IT projects a big advantage, because new technologies tend to make your projects better.   \n  \nHope that's useful. Good luck!",

They last only a day or so, which isn’t enough time to become intimately familiar with even the simplest technologies. New programmers may not even realize that they haven’t even been exposed to the difficult parts of programming yet—architecture, scaling, and maintenance. Hackathons will not expose any of those issues.\n\nIn short, a hackathon is no better than spending a comparable amount of time on a personal project, but with the added bonus of a cash prize (or similar).",

You have to use a pointer. Arrays have never become full first-class values in C. You also can't assign one array to another:\n\n    int x[2];\n    int y[2];\n    x = y;\n\nThe reason, 50 years ago, was that it would have required emitting too many assembly language instructions from that one statement (and passing a large array as a value can overflow your stack); the restriction has never been lifted because `strcpy` and `memcpy` work better for most people.*\n\nAs for why it's a pointer to the first character of the string and not to the string: pointers in C are designed to be the interface to arrays. They're how you access any element of an array, any time you do. An array, when used as a value, is always converted to a pointer to its first element; adding (or subtracting) an integer to a pointer moves it that many places through the array, and, of course dereferencing the result accesses the selected element.\n\n`x[i]` is syntax sugar for `*(x + i)`, which means (assuming `x` is an array): take a pointer to the first element of `x`, move that pointer (hopefully forward) `i` positions, then get the element at that location.\n\nSo once you have a pointer into an array, you can access the whole array from there.\n\n\n* Citation needed, according to anyone who's ever passed the wrong length to `memcpy` and smashed the return address on the call stack. But fixing that produces a *very* different language than C.",

Make sure you have a thorough understanding of all the basics of programming - from variables to loops to conditionals to functions and recursion and all that stuff. They literally write books to teach *children* this stuff - I started learning it when I was 8 - so you need to get it down cold. Like be able to write it in your sleep down cold.\n\nThen work your way up bit by bit to make more and more complex projects, writing it all from scratch. Alternate that with trying to really thoroughly understand the more advanced concepts in your language of choice. It'll take time - probably a lot of it - but move slow and learn it all thoroughly.\n\nI think most of the time when folks get stuck like this it is because they moved faster than they learned, and ended up creating things without mastering the fundamentals. I've literally seen students who were working on big web app projects who couldn't write a simple while loop without access to google or chat-gpt and they were wondering why they were stalling out and struggling.",

Explain exactly where you're stuck as best you can, so the AI can help you better.\n\nThen, when it doesn't work, go to Reddit and ask r/learnjavascript , there's lots of posts people make whenever they get stuck there as well.

If you do, it should be easy to understand for loops because they are just syntax sugar for writing them shorter. \n\nFor loop expression has three parts \n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n        //this part gets executed 10 times\n    }\n\nThe first `int i = 0` is what gets executed once before the loop starts. The second one `i < 10` gets executed before every loop iteration, and terminates the loop if it evaluates to false. The third one `i++` executes after every loop iteration. \n\nExactly the same code can be written as \n\n    int i = 0; \n    while (i < 10) {\n        //this part gets executed 10 times\n        i++;\n    }\n\nIt should be fairly easy to understand how this works. \n\nThe for loop just saves you two lines of vertical space by allowing you to put your code for initializing your iterator and incrementing it into the same place as loop condition.",

There's a ton of knowledge out there, and it's impossible to have it all in your head. Plus what you need to know changes over time, with different jobs, different projects, different situations.\n\nIf you sit me down with a task, I will probably not know the approach to take straight away. But I'll be able to not only work out the approach but also implement it. That is what you do day in and day out in a software development job, at least if you're not just cranking the same code out over and over.\n\nThe \"always manage to screw up in the end\" is the part to work on. Figure out how you screwed up and take that forward by not doing it again. They say an expert is just someone who has already made all the mistakes. Every mistake you make - if you learn from it - is a step along the path to becoming an expert. :)",

As a result, I can fill the niche of someone who can do both the design and implementation of industrial controls as well as all the analytics work and modeling. One of my more recent self directed projects(company gives out bonuses for lean/Six Sigma work if it saves time or money) was implementing a machine learning vision QC system because I was annoyed that they kept bringing up materials waste and false failures as well as false passes at meetings without anyone coming up with real solutions.\n\nWasn't too tricky because it leveraged both of my fields of knowledge - with vision stuff being a core part of automation engineering and ML being a core part of data science. I 'acquired' some high definition cameras from the stock room because it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission and set up a test station to work with. Stupid thing was the company already had some kind of setup like this but it was automatically failing everything and they didn't know how to fix it, so I wasn't working from scratch and had a *lot* of data on hand to work with.\n\nThe current process as of 9 months ago now is that instead of each part being inspected manually with microscopes, which is slow and has a lot of human flaws due to the product being high grade optical gear, it gets placed in a fixture, the operator presses a button to activate the program which then snaps a photo and scans it for flaws, highlights anything outside of spec which is then passed on to a quality technician, and is otherwise cleared for use down the line. The machine learning aspect mostly applies to parts that are less easily measurable by humans. I can't really go into more details.\n\nMy boss thinks I'm highly motivated and hard working but mostly I'm just easily bored and irritable.",

I have a bafflingly wide variety of skillsets just because my first job after graduation required me to learn how to fix stuff as an electrical technician in a factory.

Then suddenly I had to learn how machinery worked and interacted with other sections, service lasers, look at code far more complex than anything I'd ever seen before, solve physical problems without actual pre-determined solutions, reprogram stuff completely outside of my realm of expertise(like vision QC) because there were no engineers on my shift at night. A lot of the time it really sucked but the mindset I was able to form out of it, which is to say being able to take a wide overview and draw on many different areas to look for solutions to problems, has been invaluable. \n\nSome of the stuff was much older than me, basically nothing was uniform, and a bunch of the programming was in German. I do not speak German. \n\nActually only met several of the engineers at the current gig because while I was testing out some equipment I overheard them complaining about a camera system we had for measuring extreme temperature variance on the products and how the guy who does it is on vacation. Poked my head in and went \"oh hey you guys are looking at Cognex? I know how that stuff works\" because at my first job I had needed to configure a ton of them and work within the software more than a few times.

While Python is great at data-wrangling scripts and ML, it's a fairly sub-optimal for enterprise applications due to lower runtime performance and no support for data encapsulation. C++ is blazingly fast for compute-intensive algorithms thanks to your ability to allocate just as much memory as you need on the page-level, but I'd rather shoot myself in the foot than build applications with very high IO throughput. But whatever you choose to start with, **do not start with JavaScript.**",

Go to a used bookstore and buy some grade 11 and 12 math books, should be maybe $20 each. There is real value in having a consistent point of reference  & a logical progression through stuff that the internet just doesn't manage. \n\nExperiment with geometric or graphical ways to represent problems/solutions. Not everyone is great at numbers, and some problems solve particularly well using geometry that are difficult with numbers. And drawing can be fun. \n\nFocus on being really really consistent about how you solve things. For each line of the equation you are solving you should be able to write down the rule / law you are applying.  One step per line. As your skill improve & this stuff becomes brain memory you will be able to just do the operation and  not note down the rule. \n\nBe careful what symbols you use, to make sure they are distinct from the math operators. variable x and multiplication operator x is easy to mix up, so stylize or box around your variables to identify them easier. \n\nBedmas is your friend. Brackets, exponents, (multiplication and division), (addition and subtraction). Big messy ambiguous equations suck. Break things up for clarity with brackets. You can sort of treat the additions/subtractions as break points in an equation,  like this   a\\*b/c + d\\^e  =>  \\[\\]+\\[\\]  so you can think about each smaller chunk at a time. \n\nEstimation is your friend. It helps you check if things are reasonable. \n\nAI is excellent at being able to generate problem sets for you to solve. Not so good at providing you the answers. To be clear, AI is fucking terrible at math! Do not trust its answers.   \n[https://www.wolframalpha.com/](https://www.wolframalpha.com/)   may be a good reference site for you.",

Or alternatively you have a moment where you get it and it becomes a non-issue.\n\nIMO the best use of Tailwind is something like Shadcn/UI which builds upon a headless framework, Radix, then uses tailwind in a really effective way with overrides and theme extensions. If you haven’t dug around a well maintained Shadcn/UI project on GitHub I recommend you do so.\n\nOh also having to look up documentation/cheat sheet… have you installed the tailwind extension in VS Code? It’s a big help. You can hover over classes and it will show you the CSS behind them.",

When you are good at programming, the language really doesn't mater you can pick up a new one in a weekend for fun.\n\nIf you are pre-college I would say use whatever language you like, learn it, build programs with it, get good at programming i.e. breaking large problems down into smaller problems, then breaking those smaller problems down into even smaller problems, keep doing that until you can tell the computer what steps it needs to perform.\n\nWhen I went to college a long long time ago, there was basically 1 de-facto language, C, that was the language it best to know because most people there knew it and you could do your assignments in C.  Not sure if colleges these day have a de-facto language.

C++ can also be brutally slow to compile.\n* If you have a desktop machine of any kind at home, you will really appreciate the ability to `ssh` into that machine to compile larger things.\n* Back when I was using it, Crostini had a ton of subtle, annoying bugs in it that made the system kinda unstable. It wasn't particularly fun, and I finally ended up installing custom firmware on it so that I could put a mainstream Linux distribution on it.\n* My particular model of Chromebook was really poorly supported by the upstream Linux kernel for a long time and required a patched kernel to get things like the keyboard and touchpad to work properly.

If the way you're working has fundamental issues affecting how your program works, you'll find out for sure when it either breaks or becomes impossilble to work with.

        "body": "I think that learning python is a journey. No one course or class will get you to mastery of python. I have seen many students believing that doing a course gets them there. I think going through some beginners books or courses like you do is certainly a good start. I like this book which is available on GitHub for free and you can work on it directly in Colab:\n\n  \n[https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/)\n\ngoing through some texts gives you \"muscle memory\" and usually helps. Once you have done the course and worked through a book, it should be much easier to see where you are going. Especially for Python there are lots of great resources. \n\nWhen people speak about \"advanced Python\" it is not a specific course, but rather some ideas/concepts/approaches that you do not see in a beginners course. These could include iterators and generators (e.g. yield), decorators and content managers (with, wraps), typing and packaging (type hints, virtual environments, concurrency (async, await), metaprogramming (metaclasses, \\_\\_getattr\\_\\_, descriptors), performance and memory (profiling, understanding how NumPy works).\n\nI think that consistency is important. It is a matter of working 1-2 hours every day. After 3 months you should be at a good beginner level. 9-12 months might get you closer to being ready for a job. Of course, everybody is different and times depend on the individual. Using AI to help explain code or comment on your code. If you use it wisely it can act as a personal tutor. (It can also solve most of the beginner exercises, but then you don't learn much.) \n\nThere is also material you should learn like a web framework, databases, testing (pytest) , git, docker, basic deployment. \n\nI would think of this as an ongoing task. There is much to learn and you should continuously expand your skillset. In fact there is so much that each software engineer or programmer develops a rather individual profile as you cannot learn everything. For a new project you  might need to learn a new tool or a new skill, which is why after many years you become a more rounded programmer. \n\nBy the way, it turns out that employers often like experienced programmers at a level that early graduates/beginners can hardly achieve. It is a good idea to work on many different projects of your own, and put them on GitHub to develop a portfolio of projects and skills to show off. This is a great way to learn and show off what you have achieved.",

It's harder because it doesn't punish bad coding habits so your projects can become hard to maintain. Also there are a lot more frameworks and libraries to learn if you want to build bigger apps. The frameworks make coding easier because you they abstract away implementation details, but there are so many around that it can become overwhelming. \n\nThere's also more online development platforms nowadays, so you can start to learn coding online without installing anything on your machine.

You have to budget. \"Do I need to know more about how this platform works, or do I need to know how this one library works, or do I need to know how HTTP is meant to handle this, or do I need to learn how to use that new AI thingy to debug this, or...\" You have to pick. That means you have to get comfortable not knowing some things and planning out what you need to learn.\n\nThe more senior you are, the more this is true. You'll eventually need to start delegating work to others, and the whole point of that is that you don't need to come completely up to speed on all of the details of what they're doing. And in meetings, the new kids will have even worse imposter syndrome than you do, and they'll never want to admit they don't know something, so it's your job as the senior engineer to ask clarifying questions, sometimes even when you know the answer, even if you think it'll make you look dumb, to make sure the junior devs don't have to ask on their own.\n\nSome developers solve the imposter syndrome by cultivating a giant ego. \"I can't be an imposter; I'm a programming god, a 10x hax0r, I look down on fools who use (vi or emacs) instead of (emacs or vi).\" Don't become that guy. Just get comfortable with feeling a little like an imposter.",

A good design gives you that \"ah hah\" feeling when reading through the code, like \"oh, someone really thought about how this was going to work\".\n\nOf the two, I would say that having a good design is about 50x more important than having good \"style\". If you give me a program with bad style but a good design, then all I have to do is run clang-format on it (or the equiivalent). However, if you give me a program with a terrible design, then there's no amount of automation that can fix that. It's like building a house on a bad foundation.\n\nNow, that being said, if you can't even be bothered to run code styling tools on your code, then if you were to give me your code, then it will inevitably create some kind of a mildly to grossly bad impression in my opinion. It's a bit like sending me an e-mail riddled with typos. Sure, maybe I can still read it, but couldn't you have at least taken 2 seconds to press F7 and do the spell check before sending it?

Just learn a few ideas.\n\nHere are some quick ones.\n\n* Learn good variable names and function names (harder than you think, but valuable).\n* Write lots of short functions (a bit controversial), say 50 lines at most.\n* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Don't copy/paste the same code. If you're doing that, write a function that has that common code.\n\nYou're writing smaller projects that's maybe 500 lines or so. This doesn't require the same level of organization as huge programs with many files. However, it is good to organize the code within a single file.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't worry about how fast your program runs. It runs fast. Until you learn DSA (mostly the algorithms), it's hard to improve the speed, and often meaningless. \n\nOh yes, learn from others. You'll see better solutions out there. Don't beat yourself up that you didn't come up with it. Most people can't come up with brilliant code. Instead, they see others, and imitate it.

Can't stress how important it is to have a long whiteboard session at the beginning.  Map out the plan and stick to it until mvp.  Test it, show it to the customer, then refactor only if necessary.   And usually you will only be refactoring for maintainability and readability not for efficiency.   You're just starting so you are a long ways off from needing to write \"efficient\" code.  Most of the time people toil days or weeks to reduce a few lines of code which ultimately saves microseconds.   Not worth it you'll burn out and start accumulating tech debt.  So I agree with the general sentiment of get it working first then tune it only if necessary. \n\nPoint of clarity, im not saying do not write \"clean\" code that's different.

Generate a random number from 1 to 100 (or whatever range you prefer) \n\n2. Prompt the user for a number guess\n\n3. Read user input \n\n4. Convert user input to a number so you can compare it to your secret number\n\n5. Tell the user whether their guess is higher or lower than the secret number\n\n6. Loop steps 2-5 until the number is guessed, and then exit the loop and print a victory message\n\nIt might not sound the most exciting, but practice is good even for simple ideas. Games can be an engaging way to learn. They can also get way more complex than most \"real\" software for business. If you try making a few simple games and then go for something more complex (maybe use the ebiten engine to get some 2d graphics) you'll become vastly more skilled.\n\nThat is similar to my path, except I had Java 7(?) with basic swing graphics and later lwjgl engine. I love go now, though! It's not the best option for building a game client, but it's fun to work with. It is better suited to making a game server.

Similarly by separating the prints from the evaluation you could check you get the correct message by feeding the function the game result. This would also enable you to reuse the same logic for PvP and PvCPU by just swapping how each player's move is generated rather than having to modify the entire function. \n\nfourthly, you probably want to use std:: flush or std::endl In a couple places to make sure the buffer gets flushed. Otherwise it's possible the user is left there with a blank screen because the flush isn't neccesarily triggered. \n\noverall though it's challenging to say too much since it at the end of the day works, and that's the main thing. plus it's quite short and a constrained scope so some of the stuff about testing is probably overkill.",

Make sure you're only allowing the access that you want to, from the domains that you intend to. There are a lot of terrible tutorials that will tell you to use headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` which is very insecure in a lot of cases.\n\n(The same-origin policy won't affect things like cron jobs that are making requests to your backend directly. It only affects browsers, because it affects the situation where a browser is making requests *on behalf* of a user, initiated by domain A, and sending/receiving data to domain B.

When you choose your specialization, perhaps join an open source project on Github and start contributing to it by finding issues with the \"beginner\" tag, for example fixing documentation, typos or small bugs. You will have to learn version control and how to work together with other contributors. When you create \"pull requests\" with your fixes, more experienced programmers will have to review them and guide you further. You will have to read and comprehend a lot of code written by others, which will teach you a lot about the chosen programming language and problem domain. Finally, you will be able to write your own features and contribute larger code patches to a project.",

If you rely on them too soon, you risk becoming dependent on magic you don’t fully control. It’s like learning to drive by only using autopilot.\n\nOn the other hand, Python is definitely a good call especially with how tied it is to AI and backend development. But before anything else, I’d focus on mastering the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Once you’re comfortable there, frameworks will actually make sense and feel empowering instead of confusing.\n\nThis comment was enhanced by ChatGPT to improve clarity and readability",

It's obviously a very different job than traditional SWE as my day started in the maintenance \"crib\" with a bunch of physical laborers, talking about what areas of the facility need work and adjustment. But I would walk around with my laptop on a sling hooking up to conveyors and scanners, checking read rates and making adjustments to timings based on failing motors or air pneumatics.

It comes in two flawors: IT architect in the stile of Amazon / Azure. Basically is a more experienced developer. Not sure if that is what you want. But for someone that is fresh of programming should be easy to get the certifications. There is the second flawor, which is Enterprise Architect. Keyword here TOGAF certification. Good career prospect in big corporations that have to enforce standards across various department and keep in the IT (and shadow IT) in check. Very little, if no, programming in this case.\n\n\\- IT Service Manager. Basically the guy that ensure that the IT landscape is up and running in an economical way. Keword ITIL certification. Very little, if no programming here.\n\n\\- DevOps. Still a good portion of programming, but more focused on scripting and testing. \n\n\\- Legal for IT. This probably would require more than a simple certification. But there is a lot (I mean a lot) of request of people with IT skills and knowledge of the legal aspects associated to contracts, licenses, privacy aspects and their implications. Probably a bachelor may be required to work in this field. No programming needed to do this job though. In any of the previous companies I have worked for (all big corporations), this was usually a very very difficult position to fill.\n\n\\- Security expert. Keyword ISC square certificate. Is a mix of enforcing standard guidelines for cyber security in big corporations and cyber response. Probably would require a good deal of reskilling, but getting an entry job in this field should not be impossible.\n\nLast but not least. Get your burnout in check! \n\nGood luck for everything",

        "body": "If you want to leverage your background in software you could: \n\n- go into QA.  The kind of QA where you develop software to test the main system but that software never gets released elsewhere.  Tools that do test setup, stress tests, volume tests, etc.    This isn’t necessarily a forever job but one that will let you reset. \n\n- find a field far divorced from what you’ve done; if you were in banking go work at a transportation company; different problem set; different vibe. \n\n————\n\nAsk yourself what you really mean when you say your ‘work is disappearing into the void’. \n\nDescribe out loud or in writing where you’d want your work to appear: \n\nI would: \n\n- loved to have worked on developing the iPhone\n- been responsible for part of SpaceX program \n- written the program that detected fraud or cyber attacks \n- …\n\nNow ask yourself what you like doing and whether there is a need for software in that industry. \n\n\nAnother thing is to take a few weeks off and then look back at what went wrong at your old job.  Write down phrases that capture the culture or how you felt: \n\n- too many impossible deadlines\n- always picking up for other people’s delays and mistakes \n- sales over promised features; they got the bonus but we got the work \n- all the tech was over ten years old \n- no one would embrace new ideas \n- always got blame if something went wrong but never got credit for all the things that went right\n\n\nNow ask - what could you have done differently. \n\nThis is a great opportunity to learn from your mistakes. \n\n\n—————-\n\nPersonal recommendation regarding getting laid off after all those years:  take some time. \n\nAdd up all the weeks, days, months you worked rather than taking vacation.  You’re long overdue. \n\nTake a few weeks to disconnect.  \n\nBut first - let a few industry contacts know that you’re available but will be out of touch for 2-3 weeks.   You’ll reach out when you return.  Of course, you can time the emails release when you’re about to return as well.  Just don’t burden yourself with job hunting and interviews while you’re decompressing and handling the change. \n\nMy best idea for disconnecting was camping around an area I’d never visited.  Left the phone in the car so I didn’t look at it all day.   Did some fishing, swimming, hiking.  Lots of physical activity - very little mental activity. \n\nBefore you start to feel guilty that you’re not chasing the next thing immediately you should realize that you’re:\nA) still thinking about the old job\nB) stressed out & might leave a poor impression \nC) dealing with some financial uncertainty \n\nAll of these are stressors that could affect your demeanor during an interview. \n\n——————-\n\nNow that you’re back put together your search plan: \n\n1. Who do you let know you’re available \n2. What type of work/environment do you want \n3. Has your experience changed the relative importance of ‘things I want in a job’?  \n—- some people realize that stability is far more important to them than they realized\n—- others see this as breaking chains that held them to a location \n4. Consider doing some short term tech consulting - not necessarily programming.  During one break I did network installation once the wires were pulled; I did database maintenance and reorganization; did some sys admin cleanup work.  Things that were tech related but not development.  \n\nI always found lots of little things that organizations never got around to that had big impact. \n\nDid a full database backup\nRan the purge routine for old data \nRe-orged the database \nRebuilt the indexes \n\nSuddenly the system is 10x faster.  Customer was happy; salesman was happier. \n\n———————————\n\n\n\n\n\n———————\n\nSet up your daily schedule: \n\n1. Manage list of current jobs being pursued\n2. Identify new opportunities\n3. Network with people about the jobs listed in both 1 and 2. \n4. Network with people ‘without asking for a job’;  just catching up; things have changed; just talking to people while i figure out what’s next;   …. Let them suggest others to speak with & prompt them \n5. Get some exercise; burn off tension; \n6. Take advantage of any programs whether financial or search related ( unemployment insurance, job placement boards ) \n\n \n————————-\n\nWRT wanting out of tech: \n\nThink about leveraging your way out. \n\nHad a colleague who worked to develop a risk management system for derivative trading.  In doing so he learned as much about derivatives as any of the traders.  Got an interview and got hired as a trader at a smaller firm. \n\nSo have you developed any non-programming skills while developing a system?  Anything in which you’re interested and can be competitive? \n\nWould you want to run a small consulting firm?  Lots of other things required other than software development: marketing, sales, contract negotiation, project management, resource management, payroll and other admin.   Frankly the repetitiveness of that caused me to dislike that role so I hired someone to run the firm. \n\nWhat’s your personality like?  Could you do software sales?  Or software sales support?  \n\nOften ex-developers are an asset to a sales organization because they are more believable due to their experience ( and they tend to tell the truth about what’s possible and what’s not).  \n\n\n\n——————\n\nBest of luck.",

Intentionally seek out lower stress CS jobs outside of purely tech companies, for example manufacturing, logistics or energy.

Your goal is to over time develop an income producing portfolio that gives you a lot of options financially (aka FU money). That means that if you're working at a company you like, you can stay on, but, if there's a bad management shift, you can walk away without any financial worries.",

They are trying to kill OpenAI in a war of attrition and stagnate progress in the AI arms race so that they can catch up and inherit everything OpenAI would’ve been developing. \n\nTo preface this, meta is notorious for poaching talent from competitors just to have them do nothing of consequence. They literally pay people to not work for their competitors. This happened a bunch during Covid in the metaverse era. It happened a bunch more before then as well when hiring was cheap. \n\nHear me out. Meta is poaching all the top talent responsible for the creation of all the top of the line benchmark models and techniques from OpenAI. What do you do with all these people? I don’t legitimately believe that they will achieve anything more than what OpenAI and Google have already managed to achieve. I definitely don’t think their progress will be faster. There’s a limit to how many top people can work concurrently towards a goal. Not going to allege these people have an ego, but a kitchen full of chefs will not operate properly. You need some dishwashers and floor cleaners as well. All of these are chefs.\n\nFurthermore, $100M salary is literally more than most pro athletes will ever touch. I can only think that Meta anticipates these people will take the money and eventually retire. These outrageous salary figures don’t make sense for employees a corporate setting. Corporate budgets are lowkey designed so that people will keep working and spending money and work harder so they can spend more money. Paying that high of a salary in a few years is beyond effective to incentivize people to keep working. People will call it a career after they retire with handfuls of millions, let alone hundreds of millions.\n\nIt might seem outlandish what I am alleging, but none of meta’s moves make sense without ulterior motives in my perspective. OpenAI is burning money at an alarming rate, still not profitable as a software company, and can’t keep researchers as they transition from a non-profit research org to a traditional corporate hierarchy. OpenAI is nothing without its researchers. This is a perfect time for Meta to try to accelerate OpenAI’s spiral into bankruptcy.\n\nTLDR; I am alleging that Zuck is paying insane salaries for this AI superteam to basically not work for his biggest foes (OpenAI and Google), and then basically have them retire or lay them off. Furthermore, he is ok if they don’t produce anything consequential because what he gains from his competitors dying (mainly OpenAI) is far beyond what he’s paying this superteam.",

The values are written out in a public memo and there’s an internal version with plenty of extra context, and the yearly 360 cycle plus management training emphasize them constantly so there’s no way to be ignorant of them. This team member was given a 3 strike policy by the manager to improve and he clearly kept failing (I personally witnessed 1 of these strikes happen in a small meeting) so he was exited. \n\nManagers are trained to be very clear about expectations and you are given a chance to improve if you don’t meet them.

I'm not stupid, I know the one and only reason you're reaching out to me is to advance your career. You're not reaching out to me because you want to be buddies, or want to form a genuine relationship. You're reaching out to me to use my status for your benefit. The minute you no longer need anything from me, we're not going to continue talking, or having coffee chats.\n\nThe alumni from my University that are a part of my network are the ones that *I knew in college*. My genuine friends. People I directly worked with, studied with, partied with, etc. The fact you happened to go to the same school I did doesn't really mean anything to me, there's hundreds of thousands of livnig alumni from my University. Over ten thousand graduate every year. Can you imagine if even one percent of the alumni base sent me LinkedIn messages asking for a coffee chat?\n\nIf you met me in a bar, or doing some hobby out in the wild, we got to talking, found out we went to the same college, and became fast friends, *then* I would be happy to refer you. We formed a genuine relationship *first*, in an environment where I don't feel like you're using me or the connection was fake. *That's* what I consider networking. Making friends in the wild. This actually happens quite a lot to me, there's a lot of alumni living in my city, and I've made some good friends because of it.\n\nI'm not actively annoyed at getting cold messages or anything, I'm not getting angry, I'm not personally offended that someone tried to reach out to me. I just ignore them.\n\nDon't let me discourage you though.... maybe 1000 alumni ignore you, but 1 responds and you get a job because of it. So it could totally still be worth it, and there's not really a downside. That's just how I personally view cold messaging, and I feel like most of the people I know personally operate the same way.",

I have seen huge boosts for some things like getting to write boiler plate and also one-shotting medium-complicated stuff that could have taken a long time to get right. Especially big speedup if you are not an expert at the language.\n\nBUT, I have also seen the opposite that it goes well in the beginning and then the LLM introduced bugs it cant find (even latest models and different models). You are then left with a huge body of unknown code you need to understand and find the bug in. Sometimes the bug can be complicated both to find and solve because the whole thing may not have been structured as you would have done it. Even if you are a senior developer you can become dragged into the mess, essentially becoming a 100 percent vibe coder. You get locked into the solutio space the LLM made, and it becomes harder to imagine how you might have done it. There's a temptation to go along and have the LLM fix its own mess rather than taking the plunge into it, creating an even bigger mess. That can waste a lot of time and leave a bad result. \n\n Just to be sure, I think LLM-generated code is not usually bad. Often it is very good about naming, error handling, best practices, reuse... Things many humans suck at. But when it gets stuck with something it can't solve it seems to mess the whole thing up again. So you really need to use it delicately. Have a feel for what it can do, when it is on the right track, when it is really understanding an issue and where it is merely guessing. Carefully review and roll back anything that doesnt work. Use dedicated sessions with minimal context for specific difficult problems, to help focus. But it is not easy - something the LLM might do well in one context, it can screw up in another (e.g. using wrong arguments etc. even though it clearly knows the right arguments in other contexts).\n\nWhen building larger systems of lasting value, build it all as you would yourself in smaller pieces one at a time and with unit testing... rather than hoping you can one-shot it all. Try to make good design decisions and it follow them, rather than the opposite. Review what it is doing. All this will eat into the benefit of course, but I still think there IS a net benefit, unlike examples of overuse which can be net negative.",

It's not how mature software shops work. I've been in various shops for almost 15 years. That's how shops with high turnover work. The #1 asset a team has is its knowledge of the project. The #2 is the stability and organization to improve the project. Nowhere in there is it advantageous to search for some 2x programmer who's going to take a new job in 6 months after posting to cscareerquestions. Instead we gel extremely well, know our strengths and weaknesses, and operate as a team.\n\n  \nPeople retire from my current shop. I hope I'm that lucky. \n\nThis sub has a lot of posts of people chasing FAANG careers and debasing themselves for ridiculous hiring practices. It scares all the students. But here's the deal: Software shops are everywhere; FAANG has notoriously fired full divisions and teams that were discovered to be doing nothing and were only hired as a flex; Some shops have a high turnover rate and only intend to keep developers for 3 years unless they fit in a management track; Plenty of asshole bosses have \"We're hiring,\" competitions to nab that top talent out of a pool of 500 applicants, but won't settle for #2 or 3.  \n  \nBuild stuff.

That's why we first saw the engineers get cut. The dev owners and leaders get more face time and essentially blamed the engineers. Then after that didn't fix anything the started cutting middle management who told them it was the engineers fault. \n\nNow they don't know why to do so they're bringing in consulting forms and offshoring work to fill in the gaps. From what I can tell these consulting firms as really leaning on the specialized/clear cut responsibilities by telling the businesses it's impossible to higher one expert who can respond to a wide variety of issues and software in today's specialized tool environment in a timely manner. The way to fix that is using consulting firms to bring in say an architect for a month, then bring in a cloud designer for a few months, once the architecture is setup bring in the engineers. Meanwhile now you're no longer paying an architect salary after the main chunk of work is done. \n\nI actually tend to agree with it but it's going to suck for us all around people",

If you think the sprint is unachievable, *communicate that*. You're not complaining, you're establishing expectations.\n\nIf anything, *not* communicating that and just bottling it up, and quietly missing the sprint deliverables is significantly worse than if you had communicated upfront that the sprint wasn't achievable. The problem isn't the missed deadline, it's the lack of communication.\n\nDeadlines really aren't a SWE's problem. They're a management problem. When deadlines are at risk, management has the power to dial back scope, increase resources, or adjust the deadline. That's project management 101, it's stuff that PM interns know. What us as the SWE's are responsible for is *communicating* when those deadlines are at risk, and aren't acheivable. Our job is communicating the *actual* time to delivery. So when you're given an amount of work that can't be reached by the deadline, *communicate that*. Then your management can do *their* job, and manage that deadline.",

You need to get used to estimations being wrong and telling the lead/PM/whoever as soon as you realize it so that everyone can re-prioritize.\n\nFor agile to be done correctly people need to be honest (to themselves and the team) about how much work they can realistically take on. It's better that you over-estimate, finish early and pull in tickets from next sprint rather than the reverse. Unfortunately sometimes PMs get overzealous with assigning work and you need to push back during planning if you think it's too much.",

Each class I'm working on right now, I know approximately what it needs to do in my grand scheme of things, and usually write unit tests as I go. Usually at any point in my project I can either build my code and run the tests to verify that everything I've built so far builds and works as expected or I'm within an hour or two of being able to do so. There is no \"I'm going to work 3 months on this before I know anything about whether or not it works.\"\n\n\nThe projects you see in CS are not really the projects you'll see out in the industry. They've probably already told you that most software projects are maintenance. You'll very rarely ever see new design, just because on average most projects' lifecycle is 80-90% maintenance. The skill of reading someone else's code and understanding what they're trying to accomplish is not really something I picked up in CS. I had to learn that as I go. I'm not saying wait and see what industry jobs are like if you don't like CS, I'm just saying don't expect anything you do to look very much like anything you've been doing.\n\n\nThey may also have told you that programming languages are as much for communicating with engineers as it is with computers. They didn't go into a great deal of detail about that when I was in school, but a decade after I got out of school a computer program was like a book for me. I can read it and I can tell you things about  what the guy who wrote it was thinking. Probably things not even he was really aware of. Comes in handy, and it kind of feels like a superpower when you get good at it. Not saying you should do anything in particular except keep that in mind if you make a career out of this.\n\n\nIf you enjoy doing this for a living, there is never an end state. It's impossible to know everything that there is to know about computers at the moment, and has been since the '80's. There's a lot of arrogance in the field because a lot of people seem to think that they do know everything there is to know, but it's far more important to have a pretty solid idea about what you don't know. At least as it pertains to what you're doing right now. The landscape is pretty much infinite here, and far more similar to the math landscape than I realized up until surprisingly recently. You probably can find something to explore there that's interesting to you. How easy that is or whether you even want to try is of course entirely up to you.\n\n\nWhatever you decide to do, *you* ultimately set the direction in your career. This is as true now in your academic career as it is in your professional one. You can decide to stay in academia somewhere and explore the frontiers or old problems there. You can go off to the industry and solve math problems for stabilizing fusion reactors or something. You can go grind out enterprise communication code at some company and probably make a lot of money. Long's as you have the rent by Friday it doesn't really matter all that much. But you decide what you're going to do with your life, or you can try to float through it without much of a plan at all. I think a lot of people try to do that. From what I've seen, that path leads to regret sooner or later. Maybe all paths do, but if I end up regretting anything at least I was the one who decided to go that way.\n\n\nHope you find a direction you like. Good luck!",

Most of the things you did uni are nothing like building software. Cyber security is nothing like building software, and probably nothing like leetcode and your uni projects. Robotics, game development, machine learning, etc, etc.\n\n\nOne thing I personally love about software development is designing various systems and components, then putting it all together to make my application or feature work. Then iterating on that to improve it. Some argue that this aspect is more of an art than a science. You won't ever get to experience this through leetcode or university.\n\n\nI don't know how much experience or knowledge you have with coding and building things, but your post reads more like you have not actually explored programming beyond leetcode and toy projects.\n\n\nTry broadening your horizons and trying different things.

Then 6-12 months after they get hired, those red flags start surfacing. Not a lack of technical ability, but rather just being a *bad employee*.\n\nThe value of referrals for a company is it's no longer a rando they're interviewing. It's someone that another employee, one they already like and trust, is saying is a good employee. It's not instantly getting you past the technical part of the interview or anything, that's why they still give leetcode interviews to referrals. It's just vouching for your character.\n\nAll employees are able to refer people to SWE roles. John Doe in sales can refer a SWE. Betty Jane in marketing can refer a SWE.\n\nDon't hyper-focus on meeting people from tech. Focus on meeting *people*. Period.\n\nWith that in mind, any hobby that involves more than 1 person. Join a social sports league, become a regular at your local dive bar, join a meetup group that tries out new restaurants every week, do *anything*.\n\nIf you make genuine friends, your network will grow.",

The coding rounds are definitely the wildcard here. If you do decide to withdraw, be upfront with your recruiter about needing more time to prepare rather than making excuses. Most recruiters appreciate honesty and might be more flexible about future timing. You could also try reaching out to coaches on platforms like prepfully who've been through Meta interviews recently to get a realistic assessment of your readiness in a mock setting.\n\nEither way, don't beat yourself up about it - better to interview when you're genuinely ready than to rush it and potentially hurt your chances for months.",

You might surprise yourself with what you can pull off under pressure, and worst case scenario, you get valuable interview experience and feedback that will help you crush it next time.

Its kind of like when you sell something on facebook marketplace and your asking for cash but someone offers a trade but then says \"what do you want\"...i don't know, i wasnt considering a trade how about you offer up what you've got available for trade rather than me just replying i'd trade for world peace.\n\nExample, Are they a crisis management center handling assistance for the community and managing it through a spreadsheet that they share among case workers?\n\nAre they having to track their hours and theres 10 people that email one manager their time sheets and the manager has to rekey all that information into another spreadsheet?\n\nStuff like that is what you have to look for in order to know \"i can do XYZ to make your life easier\". If you just say \"hey, im a developer and would like to volunteer with you\" your going to get blank stares because people either won't care or they don't know what they could use you for.\n\nAlso, don't just limit yourself to non-profits. Look around in your area,  maybe you've got a mom and pop trash guy in the area who runs a trash route with little to no tech usage, see if you can build him a notification service so he can let out schedule changes to his customer base.\n\nMaybe you've got a neighbor who runs an etsy shop but has no way of managing their inventory.\n\nPoint is, get creative, think about whats around you and see if you can fill any gaps, don't just offer your services...offer a solution.\n\nThis is the route i did back in the day and I was always asked why I didn't just get \"a job\" or was told to \"just go get a job\" either related or unrelated and my view was at the time, i could either get experience or i could get money but at that point in time with how the market was i couldn't get both and only experience was what would lead to a career.\n\nBeen at it 14 years now. If this career is something you want to do, just stick with it, stay hungry, find ways to provide value to people...don't just offer \"software development services\"....figure out a way in your area to offer solutions.",

Networking isn't some unique task where you go to some conference or meetup, exchange business cards, give everyone a firm handshake, and declare you're all in each others network now. That's not how it works.\n\nA network is made up of your genuine friends, family, and colleagues.\n\nWhen you define what a network actually is like that, it points out why \"networking\" is a silly term that doesn't need to exist. Networking is very simply *making friends*. Forming genuine relationships with people.\n\nIt's not forming fake relationships where the sole purpose you're speaking is to use them to get you a job.\n\nTech meetups are common suggestions for \"networking\", but that's not because it's a place people go to connect on LinkedIn. It's because it's a place where people that all have a shared interest go to do that shared interest together. When you do that, you *make friends* with those people. When they're your friends, they're now in your network.\n\nYou could go to a rock climbing meetup and it would have the exact same effect. You could go to your local dive bar and make friends with John Doe over a night of heavy drinking. It doesn't matter if John Doe is in tech or not, all that matters is that John Doe *has a job*. Anyone at a company can refer people to any position. Even if John's in sales, his company is likely hiring SWE's, and he'll be happy to refer a *genuine friend*.\n\nIt's not something that really happens overnight, forming a network takes time.

Get onto the overemployed train, some easier mid-level gig - since you don't have much experience in working in a team or a bigger company that's actually a great excuse to go after these kinds of jobs for someone your age. You could potentially double your income and make a close to $300k which is very decent.\n2. Do a side thing, develop a SaaS or something like that. Or do consulting. Always on-call, but real work <10 hours - this is a perfect setup to spend 30+ hours working on something that will be both fun and can get you some extra income one day. As well as developing your skills.\n3. Ask for more money, threaten to leave otherwise. To be honest you should have done this when the market was still good, you could have easily found a job that would pay more before 2023. But still, it sounds like they will be kind of lost without you. You probably have more leverage than you think. But there is a chance that it won't work. You probably know the best.\n\nAlso in this market and with your inexperience working in a larger team (or any team), $140k WFH is actually not that bad... It is extremely unlikely that you would be able to switch careers and make more money than that.\n\nThe biggest problem I see is that you are basically always on call, 24/7. That must suck. Maybe you could develop some kind of automation around it? Also why do you think the company is going under, any signs?",

I didn't study CS -- my degree was in Math -- but iirc, the BA option for math had less Math course requirements than the BS option.  I think it may have had less physics requirements as well?  I graduated a long time ago, so I am not completely sure.  I assume a BA for CS probably has less CS requirements.  Are you wanting to take less of these courses because you are trying to double major in something else that the BA will give you space for / possibly overlap on requirements?  Getting a college degree takes a lot of time and money -- my personal opinion is that since you are spending all of the time and money, you may as well get the option that looks better on paper (which is probably the BS) unless you have a good reason not to. Having the BA won't stop you from having a career, and it may have no impact at all on your career, but since you are studying anyway, you may as well pick the option most likely to give you an edge. If you are just getting the 1 degree-- I would get the BS.  If you are trying to double major to be a more rounded human and / or give you skills for alternative careers and getting a BA makes that possible - get the BA.",

Plenty of companies still need senior engineers who can build solid, reliable software without needing to sprinkle AI fairy dust on everything or architect for massive cloud scale.

Companies hiring senior engineers want someone who can think through complex problems, mentor junior developers, and deliver quality software - skills you've been developing this whole time.\n\nThat said, the market reality is that many job postings do mention cloud and AI, so having some basic familiarity won't hurt. You don't need expensive certifications or months of study though. Spend a weekend playing with AWS free tier, build a simple project, and you can honestly say you have hands-on experience. Same with AI tools - use GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT for a few coding tasks and you're ahead of many candidates. Focus more on leetcode since that's what actually determines if you pass the technical rounds. When tricky questions about technologies you haven't used come up in interviews, use [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) to help navigate those situations and frame your transferable experience effectively - I'm on the team that built it specifically for moments when you need to confidently discuss areas outside your direct experience.",

The second, is that innovation from simpler tasks frees us to do the more complicated tasks. 1000 years ago 95% of us were farmers: iron, then steel, and coal freed us from a life on the farm and let us build cities.

There are physical limitations to how much food any one person needs, so it's easy to see how we don't need too many farmers. You can make the same case about doctors or lawyers or accountants or architects. Their demand scales with the number of people on the planet: Demand ~ Population\n\nHowever, software is fundamentally different. There's always a new idea around the corner, some service that could be digitized, some new feature to be added, some code to be optimized. The amount of software scales both with the number of people *and* the amount of digital services each person is willing to adopt: Demand ~ Population x Digitalization.\n\nFurthermore, there's an idea that digitalization actually enables such a boost in efficiency that it's still a beneficial allocation of resources. For example, suppose you're playing Economy Manager 2025 and you have to decide what to do with 10 college grads with the goal of completing auditing companies. One way is to train all 10 to be accountants. However, if you were to train 1 software engineer, that one SWE could develop tooling to boost efficiency so that even if you have 1 fewer accountant, the remaining 9 accountants could double their speed.\n\nThis is why many people view the demand side of software to be much more flexible than traditional occupations like medicine or law. However, even if the demand for software is more flexible, there is indeed a limit. Software doesn't defy the laws of supply and demand, and yes, more supply is inevitable going to cause salaries to drop and hiring to slow.",

However full time jobs are also looking for more relevant experience. If you only worked with Java before you might not get hired for a C++ role for example.\n\nI think your best bet is to have multiple sets of resumes where all your projects align with the specific role you are targeting. So if you’re doing web roles, have a bunch of web projects listed, etc.\n\nYou should list your startup experience as real experience, but maybe just put Software Developer. Lead developer with no experience is a red flag\n\n\nIf I were you I’d be spam applying to both internships and full time. Some companies will hire interns for a year after grad",

I see value in new skills but no effort to do so because why? It's not going to make me money.\n\nI found what I did was look for things at work that were awful. Certain services or processes that sucked. I made it a goal to make those better and leveraged it for promotions.\n\nOver time I met my financial goals. Afterwords chasing money felt a little empty. Because I spent time at work I had little social life outside of work. I'm slowly trying to get to know people and I attend therapy to talk about barriers holding me back. \n\nI think if I could do it over, I would tell myself there's no rush. Sets goals and try to meet those over time vs stressing out in the moment about how I compared to other graduates. It would have likely lead to me making more friends and having free time to possibly learn the new skills I found interesting. \n\nMost important, do not neglect your health for your work.

Direct company career pages - boring but effective, especially for mid-size companies that aren't drowning in applications yet\n\n3. Networking/referrals - I know everyone says this but it's still the fastest path through the noise\n\nLinkedIn and Indeed are honestly black holes right now. You're competing with thousands of other people hitting \"easy apply\" on the same roles. The companies I work with get so many applications through those channels that they barely look at them unless you have some serious keywords or connections.\n\nHave you tried reaching out to recruiters who specialize in your tech stack? Not the spray-and-pray types, but ones who actually understand the technical side. We tend to have roles that aren't posted publicly yet.\n\nWhat's your tech stack btw? That might change the strategy a bit.\n\nAre you just applying to big companies or also interested in startups?\n\nGood luck!",

That time you spent hours debugging a segmentation fault, or when you had to figure out why your algorithm was timing out on edge cases, or even when you struggled to understand a complex concept and had to try multiple approaches before it clicked - these are all valid technical challenges that demonstrate problem-solving skills.\n\nThe key is to structure your answer around the process rather than the complexity of the problem itself. Pick something where you can clearly explain what went wrong, what steps you took to diagnose and solve it, what you learned, and how it made you a better developer. Maybe it was implementing a data structure from scratch, debugging a tricky race condition in a multithreaded program, or optimizing a slow database query.

Managers know it happens and try to combat that which is why they like when employees try to make up the time doing other things. So maybe if this happens again, bring it up to the manager like \"hey her transfer is taking longer than expected. Any other options I can do to get mine's done if not, what work can I pick up?\"",

But if you let it add up, it would exponentially be slower and slower. \n\nOne time we had to transfer some major data coming in from an even higher network that was barely used but people started to use it more as the project was winding down. We realized that the higher network just was never updated so we had to routinely update it with huge transfers. I put the CD in, it took me half days work to do it. Thankfully one of the Product owners ntocied in the first week it was taking me forever so he told me he had a secure hard drive that I could use whenever I needed to transfer huge data and it cut my time down by so much.\n\n  \nAgain take it as a learning lesson.
