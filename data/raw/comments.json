Yet, none of them really solve the core data issues like nulls, duplicates, redundancy and many more. The simple and old school style of sql, bash scripts and crontab jobs can do much more than fancy tools. \n\nIt makes feel like we all should go back to roots using pure sql for most part for pipelines processing and maybe little bit of Python here and there. I hate how much noise Databricks makes using the term, \"medallion architecture\", which already been in practice for more than 3 decades even in traditional warehouse environments. They just used fancy marketing tactics to sell their product. ",

The position is unlikely to go to anyone who is external. Direct competitor has a chance if they are beyond stellar. You are competing with applicants who have connections plus are experienced plus have direct knowledge of the domain.\n\nAnother company I know put up a fake job posting for DE (the position was already hired, but needed to repost due to a migration to a new hiring systems).  They purposely only posted the position on their public website and did not post on any job boards. Received 300 applicants in less than 1 day.\n\nSad thing was, their automated rejection email says: “we have reviewed your background and qualifications and determined that we do not have a position for you” pretty fucked up considering that not a single applicant was reviewed since it was a fake posting.\n\nThis position did go to someone who needs training though, that person had alot of experience in DA, but none in DE, and since high DA salaries are in-line with entry level DE, they know the applicant is capable and will stay. The company received many stellar applicants, but didn’t have the budget to pay for their asking salaries. Also, they wouldn’t lowball someone experienced since that person will quit the second the market improves.",

A lot of decisions don't have a massive checklist of \"all the things I need to know\" that, when you get to 70% acts as a threshold triggering the decision. A lot of decisions rely on knowledge and experience and attempting to quantify that at all ends up falling into the same trap that dashboards do: Qualitative judgements are only loosely connected to quantitative amounts.\n\nI don't doubt Jeff Bezos knows what he's doing up to a point but I have my doubts his actual working practice bears much resemblance to the principle he's expressing here.

Numbers need to be put in context and fit into some kind of overarching narrative before it clicks. The great writers of Substack already understand this. Think Scott Alexander, Noah Smith, Nate Silver. Or go read Wolf Street. MUCH more intuitive than any business dashboard I've ever looked at.\n\nBut the flip side of that is: when are dashboards appropriate? Should all analysis just be ad-hoc and narrative-driven? My intuition is that you should curate a very small, simple set of business-wide KPIs and put them on an internal website and have them update reliably a few times a day. For anything more strategic or involved, where there is a key decision to be made, you need analysts to put on the researcher hat and go do the analysis (hopefully with a nice clean data model that the DEs have set up). You need them to be opinionated. Dashboards aren't opinionated, they just tell you what happened without any further guidance.",

You can't not work forever. The bank account can't look like a seive. \n\nI've taken lower paying jobs before just to fill in the gap until I get a legit offer that was close to my target salary. Having that cash cushion is sooooo important. \n\nAll this to say, my backup plan has been to stash cash during the fat times, and use up as little as possible during the lean times. I often joke to my wife that I've always wanted to work at Home Depot. I do legitimately think that if I wasn't doing what I currently am, I'd work at HD.

It should, should, execute in the time, a full table scan completes, so on 500mm rows, maybe 5-10minutes, dont know the hardware setup.\n\nReasoning behind that statement :  \nVariable length string, that is just in the table meta data. Actual data is written to data pages. So EXPANING the length, should not cause a full page rewrite of a given page, since nothing needs to get rewritten. Already existing page splits, are not effected either, its already a pointer to another page.\n\nSo, it should be rather harmless, to change the variable length, as long as it gets increased. Decreasing the length, I'd be a bit more careful, but should functionally behave the same. Not having a clustered index... it should not affect that change, since if I know how mssql works internally, it will check every row, if it complies with \"new column meta data\", so a full read trough of the entire table. It doesn't matter in reality, if that table is a heap or a clustered index for a full scan.\n\nI'd say, plan for a couple of minutes of outage, and go for it. Take a full backup to a testing stage, run the change, to get a good idea of how long you got an outage. You will have a short outage, since you will have a full table lock, and any application trying to write to the table, will wait for that lock to be released. Depending on the isolation levels, you will have read queries do the same.\n\nTLDR:\n\nShouldn't be a big issue, should be 5-10 minutes of downtime.\n\n/edit: Its gonna be a schema lock, so whatever isolation level, read queries will be blocked as well.",

You can “ask” them things like, “why did this job fail?” and they’ll trace logs and give a quick readout.\n\nBut yeah—data access and vendor lock-in are real concerns.

        "body": "Fantastic question! I literally just spent the past \\~6 months spinning something like this up from scratch for my company, except I wasn't blessed with a $50k/yr budget on tools. More like $5k/year tops. Here was my approach:\n\n* Sources: AWS Aurora Postgres database, various APIs, potentially Netsuite down the road\n* Destination: Timescale (now TigerData) database hosted using Timescale Cloud but linked to our VPC via VPC peering -- **this is where the bulk of our budget is going**.\n* Tech stack:\n   * Pulumi TypeScript to build infrastructure in AWS to support the open source version of the orchestrator, mostly using ECS Fargate for the containers and leveraging existing networking infrastructure\n   * Dagster OSS as the orchestration (went back and forth between this and Prefect before landing on Dagster)\n   * Sling as the core extract and load software to sync data from Postgres to Timescale\n   * dbt core running within the Dagster framework to apply transformations on new data in Timescale\n   * Python scripts orchestrated by Dagster to get data from APIs. Originally wanted to try dltHub but ended up just writing my own scripts using requests (probably not ideal)\n   * Monitoring/notifications via Slack app integration (originally was using [ntfy.sh](http://ntfy.sh) for quick and dirty SNS topic-like notifications, getting Slack approval was challenging)\n   * Dockerized local development using the pre-built Timescale and Postgres Docker images + the same custom Dockerfile I use for Dagster production deployments to keep things as simple as possible.\n\nData is synced from Postgres every 4 hours and daily for the APIs as that's essentially all that's required by our business. The Postgres sync with Sling runs incrementally and is complete in about 20 minutes, which is not optimized by any means but is sufficient for our purposes. For context, our entire source database was only about 330GB and I wasn't replicating the entire thing.\n\nWriting YAML for Sling and later for dbt was a huge time slog for 100+ source tables; I leveraged an AI tool (Claude) to help generate a lot of that code after manually building some of the transformation models myself. Bonus to this is it was the generated YAML was pretty consistent for common columns like `created_at` or `_sling_loaded_at` audit columns.\n\nI am the lone developer and maintainer of this project -- most people on my team are unaware that I'm even working on a project like this, let alone what its purpose might be. It has been a wild and frustrating ride at times without many others to turn to for help, but it's been a great learning experience as well. Throughout the development, I tried to stress simplicity, modularity, and ease of maintenance as much as possible. Once a larger team becomes available to support something like this, you can make different decisions like moving your data replication tasks to something like Fivetran or using a real data warehouse like Snowflake (again, budget constraints for us).\n\n~~Best of luck to you!~~ Edit: I reread the question and realized this is hypothetical but best of luck if this is ever you in the future all the same! Also I feel like my stack is pretty interchangeable with SQL Server as the source, just use different connectors with Sling (I believe SQL Server is supported).",

We even got manager-employee hierarchy into the mart, so we can use BI tools now to show things like \"which tables are queried most often by people under director X?\" or \"what is the total attributed cost of running those queries?\"\n\"... for direct subordinates of X?\", \"... for all subordinates of X?\", \"... for all subordinates of X, who are not managers?\"\n\nAnd since we did good modelling in the data mart, PowerBI, does not need any extensions, or fancy DAX to answer such questions.",

Then made a vector equivalent value of the theme and the chunks,applied a roll-over technique aswell to merge adjacent chunks which cosine similarity beats a tested threshold. Then persisted this data to my database, with every single chunk having its appropriate time-window, from where it was cut off from in the YouTube video.\n\nI then created an interface with streamlit where I could see the data-breakdown, their theme, the video thumbnail and the time the video was cut off from, (so this also works as an automatically created YouTube chapters as opposed watching the video and titling sections by hand)\n\nI also created an input field where questions relating to any part in any of the videos are asked and the top 5 chunks which are most relevant to the question are retrieved and displayed on the UI.\n\nThe videos fed into the pipeline could be a playlist or multiple channels with batch extractions.\n\nI personally use this now to get to the most relevant part of an information I'm trying to reach out to in the news.

I agree with the comments about consulting mostly, but I doubt they would put you on client work or at least throw you to the wolves like they would with an employee.  Having worked both for telcos and consulting, I will give you some thoughts:\n\nConsulting:  you will probably work on one or a few projects.  They are looking for prospects to hire when you graduate so it's like an extended evaluation.  Consulting is good because you get exposure to different industries and projects, so you learn skills and approaches you might not pick up working elsewhere.  One other thing that's maybe overlooked is that you learn how to sell and explain your work, which is valuable in companies later when you need to justify a project or hype it up beyond just explaining the technical side.  Working there as an employee though can be grueling not just because of the hours, but because you need to build your career often with little help.  They assign you to some client and expect you to pick up the skills you need.  They usually do give you some support with a mentor role, but they might be good or just suck since they are assigned.  So it can be a stressful experience depending on your personality and resiliency.\n\nTelcos:  this is a good option because you will get exposure to a lot of processes with a lot of data flowing.  It's mostly structured though, but really teaches you how to deal with high volumes.  If we are talking a bigger telco like AT&T or whatever then they tend to have all the tools and applications so you aren't looking at a kludged together mess like in some other companies.  There is data stored around all the different processes that go on in a telco, so while the product isn't the data platform, it's probably as close as you are going to get.  There is usually some pretty high-level analytics work going on as well around customer retention and upsell.",

You have small or medium workloads with burst demand\n2. You truly need global scale or regional failover etc\n3. Access to particular technologies that you might not have volume to acquire yourself\n4.

Dagster does the orchestration for me, as implied, then dbt does transformations after data has landed in Timescale, also orchestrated by Dagster.\n\nI can't really speak to how the performance would be with loading data into Snowflake via Sling, but it backfilled about 300GB of data on the initial run in under 6 hours and every 4 hour incremental loads take around 20 minutes (though this could probably be optimized much further). All hosted on ECS Fargate containers.\n\nIf we had no budget constraints, I'd probably look at a SaaS offering to do the extract and load for me, like Fivetran or equivalent.",

Couple that with the trend of leaving jobs every 18-24 months, and you never really acquire any domain knowledge, you just bounce around doing the same technical thing.\n\nThe solution?  First, identify someone who knows what you want to know.  There is always \"that guy\".  Talk to him (or her) and just ask questions.  You will start to find out what things matter and what things you don't know.  Don't treat it like an interrogation, just ask questions to help answer 'why' questions you have about your work.  \"How come we match customer data through three other systems, wouldn't it be easier if we...?\"  ...well, we do that because regulations require XYZ, and then we have to ...\n\nThis is where you begin to acquire the kind of knowledge you're looking for.

If you want to move from “I adapt what’s already built” to “I build and improve,” aim for:\n\n* **Advanced Airflow** (custom operators, sensors, etc.)\n* **dbt** (great for modeling, testing, and habits that scale)\n* **CI/CD** (even lightweight GitHub Actions can go a long way)\n* **Cloud skills** (pick one—AWS, GCP, whatever your team might grow into)\n* **Streaming with Kafka** (even small local projects help)\n\n# Make it stick:\n\nIf you tend to fall off self-paced stuff (totally fair), give yourself some structure without burning out:\n\n* Pick one portfolio project and let that guide your learning.\n* Show up at the same time every day—even 30 mins counts.\n* Use tools that track streaks (DataCamp, GitHub commits).\n* Find a learning buddy or join a Discord to stay accountable.\n\n# Are certs worth it?\n\nOnly if they *help you finish*. If a nanodegree or structured program keeps you going, it’s 100% worth it. Just avoid collecting shiny badges without building anything. One finished track with a solid portfolio project beats 10 abandoned ones.",

        "body": "The author continues their absolutely-detached-from-reality rant against Iceberg. They've essentially looked at a sledgehammer and decided that it is 'not a serious tool' because it requires more effort, is more unwieldy, and lacks a claw compared to a regular hammer.\n\nThe article indicates it is a 21 minute read, so I'm going to be somewhat brief here, but essentially other than various truisms the entire thing can be broken down. The article is also quite sarcastic and derogatory, which gives me the impression that the author is more interested in puffing themselves up than earnestly engaging with the problem space.\n\nI'll pick a few things that are emblematic of the disconnect between the author's basis for criticism and what iceberg is actually for.\n\n---\n\n> It also means that the overhead of each file is large (in the order of 1KB).\n\nIceberg (and DeltaLake/Hudi, I'll not mention again) is intended for storing many gigabytes to terabytes and petabytes of data in a given 'table' -- a few KB of overhead is going to be less than 0.001% of the data you're actually reading or writing. You'll likely have more overhead within the parquet files themselves if they've been split relatively small, and your choice of compression algorithm is going to have orders of magnitude more impact.\n\n> Putting the burden on the client\n\nThe entire point of the base layer of 'lakehouse' implementations is to decouple storage from the compute. That is: *there is no server* to even consider to be 'putting the burden on the client'. You may as well complain that trains have to run on rails.\n\n> If clients need to write manifest lists that point at all Manifest Files - we have already leaked the location of every single S3 file worth stealing\n\nThe path to an S3 file is not sensitive data, it is protected through access control to the bucket. You may as well complain that clients connecting to databases leaks the IP of the database.\n\nIceberg is not intended to solve row-level security for you in the same way that parquet does not solve row level security. It simply isn't in the scope of what it is trying to solve, because it isn't seeking to replace a database.\n\n> Did we not learn in CS 101 that if you need O(n) operations to append to a list, you are probably doing something wrong?\n\nThis section completely ignores something that the author *should* know quite well, that sometimes you exchange processing time for space consumption. For metadata files the repeated data is utterly insignificant compared to all the other reads and writes that are happening, but because we're dealing with remote storage accessed over a network then when reading it is much more efficient to retrieve a single larger block of data than make many individual requests.\n\nIn fact the author later whinges that a query has to do sequential 2 metadata reads to locate the parquet files it needs - so they *do* understand the benefit of compacting data together, but they just choose to ignore that in this instance so that they can heap more derision on Iceberg.\n\n> Optimistic Concurrency - Why it does not work!  ... is there ever a point to optimistic concurrency control? ... In Iceberg, two concurrent writes to a table will ALWAYS be in conflict \n\nA section in which the author almost realises they may be lacking some perspective, but plows on ahead anyway.\n\nFirst of all, Iceberg is considered about the overall efficiency for readers and writers that are operating in completely isolated processing environments, and when writing data they are going to be writing a *lot* of data and it may take a relatively long time (seconds to minutes). A complete pessimistic lock would prevent concurrent non-conflicting writes, which means you could only ever effectively have one writer to a table, which would be an unnecessary restricting if you have pure-append ingestion processes, and pure-append ingestion processes are very common in lake/lakehouse implementations.\n\nAnd yes, you can have non-conflicting *data* writes even if the metadata writes are conflicting, but as I've mentioned in here the metadata is insignificant compared to the data in intended use cases. Getting a writer to rewrite even a 1MB metadata file is a significantly better tradeoff than having them sit idle for many seconds to minutes, when their compute runtime is costing you money. And that's if they even get a conflict - subsecond timings on completion of concurrent writes is pretty rare for the intended use cases.\n\n>  \"Tables grow large by being written to, they grow really large by being written to frequently\".\n\nComplete bullshit. My largest tables are either full snapshots taken periodically from sources, or they use streaming ingestion with buffered writes. In fact streaming ingestion is directly a use-case for optimistic concurrency - each partition can have a separate writer and they can all write data concurrently and commit periodically.\n\n> Did I mention that 1000 commits/sec is a pathetic number if you are appending rows to table?\n\nAbsolutely unhinged criticism. The target format is parquet and the default row group size for writers is on the order of 100k to 1M rows. To hit a required 1k commits/sec you'd be looking at ingesting >100M rows/sec and 100GB/sec of *compressed* data while having each individual parquet file be committed one-by-one with a thousand independent writing processes.\n\nWhat you would *actually* do is have a partitioned writer that has 1000 concurrent parquet writes, and it commits once per second. The author is just *inventing* problems.\n\n> Intermezzo: Iceberg REALLY does not want to be a database\n\nThen why are you critiquing it like it is one?\n\nThis is ridiculous. I'm out, and I'm barely half way through the article.",

You're generally bound by the transfer rates of the source and they provide the data in whatever format they choose. It's always going to come first.\n\nLoading, is a more variable step. You're still bound by the properties of the target storage. But since you choose what you're writing you have some more control of the process.\n\nTransformation is extremely variable. You usually have a lot of freedom in deciding how you transform the source data into target data. That includes breaking up the transformation into multiple steps.\n\nMoving from ETL to ELT is more about breaking up the T than it is about actually saving it to the end. The actual process is typically more like ET1L1T2L2T3L3...\n\nT1 is often limited to very simple transformations; de-duping and some light error checking is common. Then it gets written to disk in \"raw form\". We keep this work light so it can be fast and reliable. Since real systems have errors, we want to keep this simple so we minimize the chance of dropping data.\n\nT2 typically cleans the data. That typically takes more work since we're looking at the data more carefully and changing it more. We then write that to disk too since there are many different things we might do next.\n\nT3+ are typically curation steps that answer specific business questions. They can be very expensive to calculate (there are often dozens of JOINS going many layers deep) and they often drop data (often for speed or security) so we want to keep those older versions too. These final versions also get stored so the business users can access them quickly.\n\nNone of this makes much sense in small systems. They're techniques that are used in \"big data\". I would practice the basic tools (SQL, Spark, Python, etc) and supplement that by reading case studies on data deployments. That's where you'll see the real implementations and it's never as clean as ETL vs ELT.",

Like data quality, governance, security, anonymization, masking, encrypting.\n\nMaybe try studying technologies used at your company, see what database options are there, do they use the cloud? They code in python or spark? Do they use dbt? Be curious! Maybe they even have a study path to get into the tech stack they handle. \n\nHope this is helpful :)",

I'd steer anyone away from the academy for sure.\n\nA trap laid in the agreement to join the academy is talk of a refund but only if you did every bit of course work on the timeline they set up. So if you're stuck like OP you might miss deadlines, meaning they can deny your exit request. The agreement also states all issues are to be handled via arbitration. \n\nI ended up becoming a data engineer on my own but not because of the \"academy \".",

        "body": "Depends on your team size and data size I would say.\n\nThe “right” approach is to have data loaded to s3 before redshift. But most company won’t ever do anything with this. But it allow your to grow, avoid potential vendor locking, reduce DW cost by doing preaggregation yourself before loading it in redshift, etc, etc. But all of this requires a lot of effort? Which might be slowing you down to achieving you company goals. If you have a big enough data team it make sense, if you are pretty small the loading directly to redshift is very appealing.\n\nYou’ll always have the possibility to offload the data from redshift to s3 in the futur if that’s needed but you won’t shoot yourself in the foot and not deliver anything for the first 6 months.\n\nIn terms of pricing, you are analyzing storage cost which shouldn’t be a factor imo. Yes storage is way cheaper in s3. But the size of data you have in SAP isn’t probably not that big. You need to define that first. For example I don’t see a world where you have a terabyte of data to load from SAP to redshift. A terabyte of text files is a LOT of data for things that are entered manually or mostly in SAP. \n\nNow let’s say you have a terabyte of data because your company has a lot there (which you probably don’t) then having the storage cost in redshift would be something are 25$ per month for the hole data set. Our conversation here cost more than that. Depending on type of s3 storage you might save a lot but storage is negligible for small datasets.\n\nThe real DW cost is compute, and that needs to be considered. \n\nI know the business wants SAP and ALL other sources, but you should chunk this a lot so you endup delivering things in small chunks. Everyone wants everything yesterday but that’s not how things work. Start with SAP but not all, the most relevant concepts because there’s probably a lot of tables there to sync, clean, transform to make the data usable. The goal of you DW is to make data usable but also to get a single source of truth. If you just load raw data in and let business build dashboard on top of the raw data I can tell you this is going to be a mess in 2 months. \n\nStart small, get the table requirements that allow you to clean the data, make the data available, then repeat.\n\nTo go back on pricing, if for example you think that you have A LOT of data multiple terabytes. And that the storage cost will be around 1000$ a month because you have 40 terabytes to load and that can be an issue, then I can assure you, you won’t like the Fivetran Bill. If you need to think about the storage cost, then you need to rearchitect this because Fivetran is not the option you are looking for. It’s very good to load data quickly. It gets insanely expensive when you start to really use it. Most companies won’t have issue with fivetran cost because most company don’t have a lot of data.\n\nGood luck",

See correct config to save processing and make it write faster, as no retention period. You may also apply clustering rules here.\n\nThen I would ask, do you really need redshift? I know it exists and basically how it works but never worked since I mostly only move data from staging area to silver and gold areas in S3, using again Delta/iceberg, leaving data with dimensional modeling as needed by business.\nI generally use Databricks/snowflake to process it,but so far I know, you can also use Glue for it.\nDelta/iceberg have acid properties/time travel/and others that can be selected and designed as your need, replicating redshift pros.\n\nIf it is enough, you totally save redshift costs, and got a simpler arch in only one place. If you really need redshift you send only totally needed tables there. And allow silver/gold tables being connected to other tools in future.\n\nI am totally opened to comments here and up to suggestions if it works or not.",

But for now, we use only 50-60 tables, it’s just that we don’t know what tables will we use exactly in the future based on the use cases. For now the size of the data is very less like max 50gb worth 10 years of data.\nFor this much data, direct redshift would be ideal. But considering the future, if data size increases, it will be a problem. Although data honestly wouldn’t spike much. \n\nComing to your point where if redshift is even needed: yes I feel so because we currently have tableau connected directly to sap where the devs created views which consume a lot of compute making dashboards slow. If we use s3 tables, we will have to use Athena for querying and connect that to tableau, and we have a lot of complex queries/views built on top. I don’t think it’s a good solution to use Athena as our query engine.\n\nAnd I am the only DE here so it will be difficult for me to write code for every table and it’s upsert logic if it lands in s3 first. And it’s really too much dependency on me for every new table. \n\nFivetran makes it easy to load data and also handles auto schema changes. But again, it’s expensive.\n\nHence I am at cross roads.",

But note that it’s kinda nice to have a language that anyone can easily understand and transform data with rather than a specific one. Even more if you are a very small team of 1.\n\nAlso this is nice , but doesn’t seem manageable by only you. It’s a lot. Also I think you need some really good argument to change something that is currently working (redshift) with something that slower and would do the same thing.

As a data engineer I consider it's part of my job.\nMy concerns about DBT is that it's a simple product but not sealable in the future. Especially doing unit tests is very limited as some column types are not supported making testing some models impossible. With Spark jobs I can fully test queries making sure to handle edge cases properly and it's easier to scale jobs when data volume will grow, with DBT running on GitHub actions runners we are limited in performance and from my point of view it's not a clean way to schedule jobs: no clear monitoring, retry policies etc. like with Airflow for example",

You don’t need CDC or any schema changes on the source DB, which was a big win for us.\n\nMight be worth checking out if you're still exploring options.",

The pro subscription is a fixed cost per month (quite low), so if you have numerous job runs per month, it approaches 0 cents per run.\n* There are no details on the configuration / connectors being used for loading the TPCH dataset. CPU usage can vary quite a bit depending on the connector, and underlying driver. Furthermore, it could be mis-configured or not using the most optimal setup. Overall, users are quite happy with the performance.\n* Many useful features are omitted, such as [VSCode extension](https://docs.slingdata.io/sling-cli/vscode), [transforms](https://docs.slingdata.io/concepts/replication/transforms), [runtime variables](https://docs.slingdata.io/concepts/replication/runtime-variables), replication tagging, [python wrapper lib](https://docs.slingdata.io/examples/sling-python) (which is quite easy to use compared to dlt), [global connection system + dbt conns support](https://docs.slingdata.io/sling-cli/environment), [column casing/typing](https://docs.slingdata.io/concepts/replication/columns#column-casing), etc.\n* Sling reading APIs will come out soon, currently in private beta.\n\nWhat has become clear, at the end of the day, it is a matter of taste. Users prefer sling over dlt (or vice-versa) due to the type of overall UX and flexibility they each respectively provide.",

My understanding is that Pulsar is a push-based publish-subscribe model (like if you subscribed to someone’s Substack email newsletter). You therefore need a translation interface to perform the pull from the API and then publish it in the appropriate stream or message queue format to Pulsar. You may need something similar between Pulsar and Ceph as well; I’m not familiar enough with Pulsar to say. \n\nUnless your API fetcher has the ability to also write to object storage, your first point of storage appears to be the post-Pulsar Ceph so would be there. Ideally you want to create that archive copy as close to the source as possible, so it’s determining where the storage opportunities are in your flow. I’ve not heard of Aerospike before but a quick skim doesn’t look like it’s for this requirement. \n\nI asked about the role as it sounded like you were scoped to design the solution, which engineers tend to get a bit twitchy about PMs/POs doing 😅.

Either meet with a department head or manager who wants something done, or meet with an individual who's been asking for something to be fixed for months.

The worst datasets and tables are the ones I'm intimately familiar with. \n\n**4.

Take some Udemy courses, watch YT videos on dimensional modeling. There are plenty of free project YT videos on building pipelines. \n\nSince you're good with Oracle, start there for a valid certificate that you think can relate to DE role, even a data or solution architect certificate would be good on resume but experience always precedes certificates. \n\nLearn distributed compute and storage (Snowflake, Databricks), one is fine. Databricks has uphill learning curve compare to snowflake. \n\nPickup little bit of cloud (AWS or Azure), one is fine since the concepts can be applied across. Google cloud isn't very popular compare to the other two. You can also pickup cloud related skills on the job, doesn't have a steep learning curve. \n\nIf you're aiming for FAANG, then you'll need to learn DSA (Python works).

Why don’t you standardise your event log format/structure and emit it via logging.info()? Since you’re using Cloud Run, any stdout/stderr should be captured in Cloud Logging (which gives you access to Log Explorer & Cloud Monitoring for free). If you only want to track specific numeric values, then you can log them specifically in Cloud Monitoring.\n2. Alternatively, after standardising your event log format/structure, you can continue to export it to GCS and set up a Data Transfer Service to BigQuery. Or, if you want to continue using Postgres, you can setup a Cloud Function or Cloud Run Job (triggered by GCS) to load the data accordingly.",

I have no experience with Azure Synapse Serverless so I can't say either way.\n\nAnother option would be looking at RedGate tooling, which is my go-to for commercially licensed support for any of Microsoft's database technology. Nothing really compares to it and their tooling is extremely mature and has more features than you could ever use.",

You probably have no interest in how dating websites work etc. That is the likely reason you are not excited about it.\n\nPick a subject you enjoy in real life, like Football, cooking, rugby, gaming, etc. Then think of a little idea. Take football for example, you could build a simple hard coded Stadium displayer. Which shows you the top 10 largest stadiums in the world. It can then display facts about each stadium. Keep it real simple, nothing fancy. Make sure you write the project idea down too and break it up into small objectives.\n\nFor example:\n* Create array of hard coded data\n* Create stadium card to display name, image, stats like capacity, facts like famous matches played there\n\nThen once you have a basic version, have a look at it and see what to improve. Things like add a database, authentication, better styles, etc.\n\nIf you don’t relate programming to what you are actually passionate about and enjoy then you’ll probably just eventually drop it.\n\nThe people you see that are passionate about programming and love it are actually passionate about the area they’re building in rather than the idea of programming itself.",

You can do leet code, making your own app, it doesn't really matter, what matters is you are staring at code so your brain gets better at it.\n\nIf you do this you will have a bunch of free time and be ahead of everyone. If you don't do this you will be in a rush all the time and that SUCKS. Luckily I got this advice early so I only did like 1 or 2 all nighters in my entire degree.\n\nAlso make friends with your tutors and ask questions, it might take a few months but figure out who the smartest people in the year are and try and get into their study groups.\n\nAlso exercise. You will probably be able to take advantage of free classes at the gym and it does wonders for your mental health. To clarify join the classes as they will teach you how to exercise correctly, don't try and figure it out on your own.\n\nIf you want to get a partner / find a fun social group join the evening student dance classes. There's usually like salsa or something. If you have some social anxiety this will help MASSIVELY!\n\nIf you want to code in the evenings too see if there's some kind of competitive programming stuff like capture the flag teams. You get to travel on them and it's a pretty wild experience. You will also become friends with more experienced programmers who can give you great advice.\n\nJust to highlight again, 9 to 5 every week day you are studying.\n\nGood luck and have fun!",

This website doesn't deal with finding a job, but is great for knowing \\_what\\_ to learn in many technologies and career paths: [https://roadmap.sh/python](https://roadmap.sh/python) . If you don't have direction, that gives you it. Also join smaller online communities where daily discussions happen, so you can see not only what's in the tutorials and curated content, but how things work day-to-day.\n\nSkill itself is not enough to find a job. Yes, the market is much tougher than it was 5 years ago, but programming is still the right choice if you have the brains for it. It's going to take hard work to get a job, but the value/effort ratio is much higher than that for other jobs. The best case scenario is to know someone that can introduce you to the right company: trust and a feeling of community are valuable to companies that know what's good for them. So see if you, your family, or your friends know someone like that. Even if they don't have an opening, they may introduce you to further connections of theirs. Listen to their advice and don't take anything for granted.\n\nIf you can't find that person, it's time to polish your CV and hit the job boards. If you're not at all comfortable with your skill level, aim for \\*\\*PAID\\*\\* internships. You might need to apply to hundreds of jobs. It's going to feel like a slog, but it's worth it. Be respectful, definitely don't let AI write your application or emails, the lack of effort is noticed. Many companies won't notice a presence of effort either, but you're better off without them. When you see a company you really like, try to prototype an open source project in the same domain as their product, and put it in the application. Best case scenario they see the effort and dedication, and they'll know you can be valuable to them, worst case scenario you have one more small project in your portfolio for the next company you apply to. There was a period where being disruptive and extra casual gave you a leg up, we're no longer in that period: be respectful (don't confuse this with submissive) and professional. Remember the people on the other side are people too, and if you can make their life easier by being honest and not making the interview/email tough for them, they're more likely to want you as a team mate.\n\nBest of luck, and if you have any more questions feel free to ask.",

I was only employed there for just over a year as the company went into administration after that.\n\nFor the first 6 months, most of my work was making changes to the company website, updating pages, adding new functionality, fixing bugs etc.\n\nAfter the first 6 months, the company decided to redesign the website and to try to implement a proper content management system for the website and I was given the task of finding the right CMS, putting together a proposal for that CMS and then implementing it. I also did the website redesign (although I was building pages based off wireframes and a spec written by someone else, I'm not a graphical person). About a week after the launch the whole company went into administration, so no one really ever got to use my new website.\n\nIt was a small multinational and I was working out of their HQ. The web team was basically only 2 of us, and my boss spent most of his time working on the ecommerce site, so I got a huge amount of freedom to learn and try new things.\n\n  \nEdit: If anyone's wondering how long ago this was, I was working with classic ASP, asp.net 1.1 and webforms (which were all cutting edge at the time). Also Tables were an acceptable way of doing a 3 column page layout",

This is similar to being able to *read and understand* novels, but not automatically being able to *write* meaningful, fully developed ones.\n\nAlso, don't forget that code is only the *end product*, the final stage. What is before the code, what is leading to the code, the thought process, the design decisions, the compromises are what really counts.\n\nDo not just focus on the code. Focus on having a problem, analyzing the problem, breaking it down into smaller and smaller parts, then solve each of the parts individually and finally implement the solutions in code.\n\nI totally side with people saying that building stuff is the key as that is how entire generations of programmers learnt to program, even before the internet with its countless tutorials existed. Yet, only trying to implement already existing solutions is not the best way to get there.\n\nMy recommendation would be that if you see an interesting project somewhere try to replicate it *without* looking at the code first. This is the real way to learn. Figure out how things work. Try things. Experiment. Fail. Fix. Succeed.\n\nDo not be afraid of failure. Every failure is teaching you something. It is gained experience. You know now how not to do something, which is equally important to knowing how to do something. Failure and struggling are absolutely integral and vital parts of learning. The more you struggle, the more you remember.",

No one here can tell you if your approach is good FOR YOU.\n\nIn principle, your approach seems not bad. You should keep in mind as you go through these exercises that no matter how many repositories you comb through, you will only ever be touching the tip of the iceberg. The world of software development has more ways of doing absolutely everything than you can shake your fist at, and you will never become an expert by just looking at other people's work.\n\nI suggest as you go through these exercises, instead of trying to rebuild the same thing you just observed from scratch, establish a cadence of identifying problems that can be solved or improvements that can be made with code. While reviewing repositories, take notes. Then, when using the concepts you discovered in these repositories in your own solutions, do not allow yourself to look at the repositories at all. Instead, look at your notes.\n\nAnd remember as you go through this that it is not recreating other people's solutions that makes a great developer. I understand you're just trying to get started, and that's fine. But be aware that at some point you will want to detach completely from the example repositories and make an effort to implement a novel idea without any example to guide you. Programmer talent really shines when you find a gap and fix it. And the best developers are the ones who can think outside the box and identify solutions where one is not readily available. So make it your goal to get to a point where you're comfortable trying to do something that's entirely yours.",

How to code comes out of having a need that prevents you from attaining or achieving something that you want.  Figure out the why, and the how will come with experience.  \n\nWith your approach, you don't know why code is written in a certain way, or why code is written at all in a project to some extent.  It's a lot easier to learn when you know what the end objective is, and what success looks like.  It's a measurable, achievable milestone, rather than aiming at some amorphous end point that isn't anchored to the amount of experience and know-how you have.\n\nAn analogy; if you play chess for the first time, you may think that a good approach to play is to just capture as many pieces as possible.  Unfortunately, chess isn't so simple.  An 1800 ELO player is going to make moves that a 400 ELO player simply cannot even begin to understand the justification for, even if they understand the how, which was simply to move a piece legally.  So you might be able to go into a mature code base that people acknowledge as being well-written.  But you have no idea why it was written in that way, the intentions, the problems faced, the historical context.  And if you can't figure out the why, then I might as well hire an LLM over you, because they at least know the HOW even better than a human, even if they have no idea WHY they're writing code in a certain way for a certain purpose.",

By looking at someone else's solution you risk locking into what might very well not the best solution (or even a good one!).\n\nRemember: just because a program runs doesn't mean it's perfect. There could be all sorts of fuckery going on under the hood, things held together with spit and a prayer, and the next time the program gets updated, the author's best choice is to just start over from scratch - this happens a LOT in the real world.\n\nSo unless you're at the level of being able to determine if their code is good or bad (in which case reading their code is probably going to be pointless), copy the program by using it, learning it, and then recreating it - but better, of course.

See what happens, and what you can make happen, and understand what things do not just through your research but intuitively. What does it actually look like to change this number? Does it do what i expect? Can I add a button, or reroute a button to go somewhere else or do something else entirely?

        "body": "So when you move from C-like languages to Python you have to avoid \"thinking in C.\"  It is kinda hard to explain but every language has a \"mental model\" you have to adhere to.  If you use a \"mental model\" that is incompatible with your current language, it creates a sort of mental fog and you will get stuck.  \n\nI can tell you have a C model because you used words like \"iterate\" and \"insert.\"  I know Python programmers use them too but these words don't mean quite the same thing as what you have in mind.   \n\nThe mental model for C is \"memory\" like little pieces of boxes of data that you manipulate.  This data has an address and a type.  Variables in C are really pointers (of specific type) pointing at memory boxes. \n\nThe mental model for Python is more complicated because it has multiple fundamental types.  I will just use colloquial naem since a lot of higher languages all share these types.  They are scalar, array/vector, hash-table/named-array, and pair/dict.  Note they are not interchangeable.  When you program them you have to keep track of which type you are dealing with.  \n\nThis may seem trivial but it is a big difference especially with the issue you have.  You see, an array in Python is not the same as an array in C.  An array in Python is ***a type of object*** while in C it is just ***an array (a continuous line) of memory boxes.***\n\nThis means you cannot think of insert as ***iterating*** to the right spot of the memory and ***insert a box*** and move the rest of the box over to the right (assuming going from left to right).   \n\nIn object oriented languages like Python, you just simply use the object's method to insert.  Doing it any other way is just creating trouble for yourself.   \n\nIn some sense this gives Python its ease of use but it also creates a strange weakness.  Python programmers often have trouble adjusting to lower level languages like C.  It is your problem in reverse, except it is a lot harder to overcome.  \n\nI do not understand it completely but I feel it is like learning a manual clutch car versus automatic.  It is easy to learn automatics because you do not need to understand much to start much.  On the other hand, you need to understand the gear boxes to have that mental picture of the gear switching process when you drive to feel the gears switching into the right positions to get it.   If you are already accustomed to something easy why would you ever bother and want to struggle with something hard.  You will just quit.  So, congrats for learning a C based language first.\n\ne:  a big weakness of higher level languages, most but not all, is that you cannot create new fundamental types.   You might be asking what other types could there be?  A lot actually, pretty much everything you find in the standard C/C++ library.",

Tho, it’s still super friendly with important high level functions available to you! \n\nThe idea of macros in Rust is also attractive. So after a bit of JS, web and Python. I’m going deep into Rust.

I think youre confused because you have skipped some steps. games are very complex as softwares and building one with no concept of coding or system design would be very difficult.\n\ni think you should go learn coding first. know the more complex data types. know some algorithms so you can learn to think like a problem solver. the journey of learning is different for everyone. idk what would be best for you, but i can share how i started back in the day.\n\nso this is how i learned python: wanted to learn in a more practical way instead of just watching tutorials. went to https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard. picked python from their \"prepare by topic\" section and just started solving the problems one by one. you can see that it starts from very basic stuff like hello world, then arithmetic operators, if-else, loop... and eventually moves on to harder stuff. i googled when i got stuck. looked at solutions if i failed. even if i succeeded, i looked at solutions as it would always teach me different ways of doing things. i found the one-liners very interesting in particular. hackerrank gives you a goal, in the form of badges. i kept doing it till i had the max level badge. after that i moved on to codeforces to practice more problems. found this ladder [https://earthshakira.github.io/a2oj-clientside/server/Ladder11.html](https://earthshakira.github.io/a2oj-clientside/server/Ladder11.html) . some easy-ish problems that you should be breezing through.\n\nthis entire thing should take you 1-2 months. you should be very comfortable with python at the end of this journey. switching to something like gdscript or c# shouldnt be a big issue. if your look closely, all languages are same with some small fancy syntax differences. if you find yourself losing interest halfway through, then you might not be as interested in coding as you thought.\n\nmaking a game would still be a challenge after this journey but you should find yourself in a far more comfortable position that now.",

This will give you a solid baseline to work from. I suggested Python, because you mentioned *Godot* for Game Dev and Python is closest to GDScript (which is basically a specialized Python).\n\nThe fundamental data types are easily explained:\n\n+ *boolean* - a \"yes/no\", \"true/false\", \"on/off\" value\n+ *int* - a whole number\n+ *float* - a decimal number\n\n---\n\n*Class* is a bit more difficult: it is a scheme, a blueprint for data (fields) together with behavior (methods) - it is a generic description of what can be stored and done with something. Think of e.g. a *Poker Card*\n\n+ it has a *suit*\n+ it has a *rank*\n+ it may have a *numeric value* (mostly for sorting, or similar, or for a point value)\n+ it has a *face* (image)\n+ it has a *backside* (image)\n+ it can be *face up* or *face down* (which decides what the card will report when asked)\n   \nall the above are *data* - they are *fields*, *attributes*. Then, there is *behavior*, the *methods* - for a Poker Card these are fairly simple:  \n\n+ It can report its rank (provided that it is face up)  \n+ It can report its suit (provided that it is face up)  \n+ it can be *flipped* (toggled between face up and face down)   \n+ it can *draw* itself  \n\nNow, you have a *concept* of a *Poker Card* - a full description of the data and behavior - this is a *class*.\n\nAs such, this doesn't say anything about a *specific* card yet. That's where *objects* come into play - they are the *concrete* implementations, like the \"Queen of Hearts\", the \"Ace of Spades\", etc. Each card in a Poker Deck is a concrete *object*, an *instance* of our *Card* class, of our *blueprint*.\n\n----\n\nWhen to use what is a different story. This comes with practical experience. The more programs you write, the better you will understand what to use when.\n\nNote that in my description I did not (apart from \"class\" and \"object\", \"boolean\", \"int\", \"float\") use *any* programming language specific terminology as these *concepts* are common to most programming languages.\n\nExactly here is where good *courses* (like the aforementioned course), not just *tutorials*, shine. They explain everything from the ground up and give you ample practical exercises so that *you* have to do the work and understand the subjects.\n\nYou will need to sit down and start from zero with a proper course. That's the way to go.\n\nMost of the tutorials around assume some pre-existing knowledge or fall short on explaining the fundamentals.",

Its the standard reply I've seen when people ask \"how do I learn\" and other people respond \"just learn by doing projects from documentation and tutorials and such\"\n\nPersonally, I think that's incredibly stupid. It is migraine inducing cuz you're just flailing about randomly, and your foundations will be non-existent cuz your learning methodology involves \"monkey try thing, monkey see if thing work or not work, but either way monkey not know why thing work or not work\".\n\nFind a long detailed tutorial which suits your tastes that covers the fundamentals.  \nThe typical data-types (float vs double vs array vs list vs dict vs Godzilla's ballsack), the typical loops and the differences between them (while do vs do while, for vs while), indexing (most programming languages have 0 indexing), etc.\n\nIt may not be as sexy, and where Joe schmoe has a fully fledged game you may only have theoretical knowledge, but the difference is when you design a game, you will actually know how & why it works and you'll be able to account for why you chose a double instead of an integer and why you needed to use X instead of Y.\n\nPersonally I liked this tutorial [https://youtu.be/\\_uQrJ0TkZlc](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc) when I was beginning, but feel free to find one which suits your tastes.\n\n  \nBut yeah - how do you learn programming. My opinion, same way you should learn anything else. Don't put the cart before the horse and just start wildly doing things. Learn the fundamentals - what elements are at play, how they can be used, how they can't be used, etc. ONCE you're solid on that (won't take too long, its simple stuff, a few weeks depending on if this is your main pursuit or your learning it as a side interest) then do projects and learn by documentation and such",

But to be of any use to anyone, you'll need to break both of those down into separate smaller problems - how to make bolognaise sauce and how to cook spaghetti. \n\nThe spaghetti is fairly easy (assuming you're using dried) - boil some water, add salt, add the spaghetti and cook for 10 mins. That's a reusable little skill on its own that can be used with loads of dishes, and at some point could be switched out for a version where you make the spaghetti from scratch, without affecting the other part of the recipe - the sauce.\n\nFor the bolognaise itself , it's a bit more complicated - fry the onion, brown the meat, add the herbs and tomato sauce etc. \n\nAgain, each of those steps can be broken down into smaller ones. E.g. the onion - how to dice it and how to correctly cook it is a stand alone set of skills that, like cooking pasta, will be something you'll do in loads of recipes.\n\nWhat's any of this got to do with coding, you may ask. Those smaller steps - cooking the pasta, slicing the onion etc - are small reusable (and potentially replaceable) steps that are the equivalent of how you'd break down your code into reusable functions, and they all roll up into that top level overall recipe/application.",

You can draw rectangles & circles simply as well. If you're coding in OOP you can even make those classes. Since there's movement, and things are updating, you'll likely need a core game loop - easy enough to track. \n\nWe can then break things down further: \n\nTo make collisions, you need to know when a ball collides with a paddle. To know that, you need to know\n\n1) The Ball's position \n\n2) The Ball's direction (it shouldn't collide if it's not travelling toward the paddle)\n\n3) The Paddle's position (should be mostly static horizontally speaking)\n\n4) The Paddle's direction (either left or right)\n\nSo when the ball's at a point where it could collide with a paddle, check if that paddle overlaps with the ball, and if the ball is travelling toward it. \n\nIf so, calculate the reflection angle of the ball, apply that to the ball - maybe keep track of the paddle's travel speed and factor that in somehow. If the ball isn't colliding with anything, just let it travel on - adding the sine & cos of its direction to its position values (scaled by speed). \n\nThen we gotta add the player in. Let them control the left paddle with their W & S keys, or Up & Down, or their mouse, either way. If they move them (i.e. keep track of the last position of the mouse, and check whether it moves between updates), apply the movement to the paddle vertically (not horizontally) and scale that by how fast you want the paddle to move.\n\nFor the computer, either create some decision tree (like, if the current ball direction would cause you to miss, move toward it. Else, move to centre?) up to you. Or just have it go up and down.",

Since you have some idea of how to do this, then do something much simpler than pong.\n\nThere is always the challenge, when breaking down a problem, that you won't know how to do some step. For example, if you've never worked with interactive graphics, then you'll be stuck at that point, having to learn what to do.\n\nAnother challenge is how pong deals with the angles that the \"ball\" bounces. Is this something realistic or is there some pseudo-physics going on? It does seem to roughly obey angle of incidence equals angle of reflection. In other words, figuring out the dynamic behavior is hard.\n\nI'd probably try something like Snake where you don't have to deal with those kinds of physics.\n\nI think, as people break some of these problems down, they still wouldn't be able to code it up. They would still need extensive Googling or asking an LLM to find out answers they need. I doubt some will figure out the math needed if they aren't that strong in math (and even if they are, but are out of practice).",

If they write tests then you can review logic but besides that if it’s something important and non trivial you need to actually test it yourself in dev or even locally.\n\nSo for code review you don’t really need to think much about it. It would be checking for basic bad practices mostly. Conditionals that could be simplified but aren’t clear, bad naming, etc. More things you could expect to make the code confusing or difficult to add to in the future. Also of course you can check for basic business logic that it probably does what it should and whatever else you might happen to stumble upon. \n\nWhat is it like when you receive code reviews? I think you’re mixing code review expectations with general teamwork communication. I would think before you get to code review is typically when you make yourself available to answer questions and help younger devs out which it sounds like is your next wanted steps.",

Which is the basics such as knowing how to use variables, functions, logical statements, booleans, etc.\n\nStart small with basic projects related to something you enjoy in real life. For example, football, cooking, wrestling, gaming, etc. Take gaming for example, I’ve been playing runescape lately and enjoying that. I thought of an idea where you can select the items you want to upgrade to and it will tell you exactly the costs and items to upgrade it with and give a plan on that.\n\nWith any project break the idea / problem down to smaller objectives you can easily do. For the above I would do something like:\n* Hard code the upgrade data and item list for now\n* Create a function that can calculate the upgrade route of selected items\n* Display the items that you can select \n* Display the upgrade route once items are selected\n\nNow always keep your project simple and hard coded, then you can start adding improvements. For example I can connect it to a database, maybe supabase or MySQL or mongodb, etc. I can also connect it to authentication so users can save their ideal upgrade builds, presets, etc.\n\nYou want to always start small, then incrementally add to it. By adding overtime, that’s when a project gets complex. Even with the complex projects you mentioned, if you break them down into parts they’re actually very simple.\n\nYou have HTML, CSS and JS knowledge, so I’d recommend you pick up a framework like React / Next.js, Angular or Vue. I’d recommend you try all three with a basic project then you’ll get a feel on which one you’d like to use long term.\n\nIf you want some project ideas give a shout on what you enjoy and I can hit you back with some ideas. Try not to use AI during this period, use things like documentation, googling, books. Then once you’re comfortable you can use AI for research but don’t heavily rely on it for your code, you want to use it to help you grasp concepts. The key thing for you right now is to learn problem solving while you’re doing these projects.",

You download an *SDK* (software development kit)\n2. You write your code\n3. You compile/package it (or not, depending on the language)\n\nFirst off, what you're downloading is not the language, as that is more of an abstract concept, it's software that uses the language to build software. That can include an interpreter (e.g. with Python), a compiler (c), a runtime (java), and other tools such as a debugger.\n\nWriting your code is what you do with e.g. pycharm, but you can do that with anything. At the end of the day, what only matters is the content of the files, so whether you write it with pycharm, notepad, visual studio, or Morse code doesn't matter (it matters to you of course, not to the machine).\n\nAnd then there's what you're actually inquiring about. This steps is what depends most on the technology you're using. With Python, there isn't really anything more to do: you write your scripts, ...and that's it. You just run them and that's your software. That makes it easy and convenient, but not very user friendly which is one reason why you generally don't use python (directly) for user facing applications. For java, the final step is compiling into jar files, or an exe that will use the jar. That's already what you're doing when testing it while writing the code. The only difference is you might be including or removing some stuff from the final binary that you ship to users. Similarly for other compiled languages such as c and c++, it's the same story. The only difference is, you have to compile for each configuration (architecture, os, etc.), but don't need the user to download a runtime. Then for web stuff like JavaScript, it's a bit more complex since you have to host the website on the internet if you want people to access it. But here it's actually the most similar to what you were describing: you do use a software that brings your software to life, the browser! It's a bit similar to Java's runtime but way more involved \n\n\nI hope this kind of makes sense? It's hard to explain without knowing what you know and understand but hopefully I gave a somewhat clear picture of how it works. And don't worry about not understanding all of it, the world of software is vast and complex and developing software is as much about writing the code than it is about the final steps of deployment!",

There isn't a single answer for every type of thing you want to build.\n\nIn general if you want to build an app that you want others to be able to use, here are the most popular options:\n\n1. Make a website. It will cost you $10/year for your own domain name like Grumpy\\_Gremlin49.com, and $5 - 10/month to host the website. You'll need to learn some HTML and CSS to design the content, but most of the logic can be implemented in Python. The best part about the web is that it's the easiest for end users - they just type in your url and they're immediately using your app.\n\n2. Make a mobile app. For iOS it costs $99 to become a developer. You either make an iOS or Android only app using the special languages and frameworks designed for that, or you use a cross-platform framework designed to let you build an app once. There's a framework for making mobile apps with Python (Kivy) but it's not very professional. You upload your app to the play store / app store and then users can download it and use it.\n\n3. Make a desktop app. You can do that with Python. The main problem is getting it to users. You'd need a website to distribute it (see #1), and browsers and virus scanners will try to stop users from installing and running it. This is a fine solution for sending to a friend or making an internal app for a business, but these days making a good cross-platform desktop app for end users is a real pain. If you want to make an app for the Mac or Microsoft app stores, that does solve the virus scanner problem but it limits what your app is allowed to do.\n\nSo your next step is to pick one. The more specific the better. Pick something like web or iOS. Don't say \"all of the above\". Start somewhere.",

One of the mechanisms to do this is to containerize your application so that all system dependencies are bundled into the container (Docker is one of the easiest containerization tools; if you want, you should research Docker and Dockerfile).\n\nAfter the above packaging step (the usual artifact at the end of this stage is a deployable unit, in this case called a \"container image\"), you will need to then research how/where to host your application. If you are targetting running this code in the cloud (say AWS for eg), you will then need to research and decide whether you want to use Elastic Container Service (ECS) or a kubernetes-based solution. If going with ECS, most of the infrastructure-provisioning will already be taken care of - you will simply sign up for an AWS account, and then configure what tier you want to choose (depending on how heavy your application is and also depending on volume of users). Then comes the actual deployment.\n\n  \nI have skipped some steps like unit testing, CI builds, connection to a database, security (both runtime/dynamic scans and static scans). Depending on your comfort level and (I assume) your aim to get to a full-fledged application, you will need to research these as well. Ofc, if your application needs a UI, and assuming your python code is simply exposing API endpoints, you will then need to research react / angular / nextjs / vuejs /  etc (javascript frameworks) that will be used to build the UI for your application. That codebase will also follow a similar pattern of running the app, packaging, hosting, testing, etc.",

        "body": "Changing a language is kind of dangerous. Imagine a language changed every 3 years. You write a bunch of code this year. Three years from now, they change it, and now your code is broken. Does that seem reasonable? Many beginners feel code changes and they want to learn the latest, not realizing, using the same argument, that in a few years, they'd have to learn something new because the current stuff \"became obsolete\".\n\nOf course, 20 years is a long time, but languages that last time often change without breaking.\n\nFor example, Java has come out with new versions over the past 30+ years. Still, in principle, code written back then would still run now. The biggest changes occurred roughly 20 years ago when generics were introduced. Yes, there are a some other features that came out, but if you stuck mostly to that technology, you'd still be decently fine in Java. You'd only add to that knowledge instead of throwing it away.\n\nKeep in mind that code tends to stay around for long periods of time. Code can last 20 years or even longer. If you had to rewrite that code just to keep it up-to-date, that would be crazy amounts of unnecessary work. Beginners think new code is written all the time. They hear Rust is big, so they think millions of lines of Java code are tossed out, and they rewrite it all, not realizing how hard it is to rewrite code. If it took years to write, it takes years to rewrite.\n\nNow, there are things that have gotten old, but mostly in web technology. Even so, some still hangs around. I thought PHP went away 20 years ago. It's still around. People still use it because web sites were written 20 years ago. Sure, everyone tells you to learn React or something newer.\n\nThere was a posted months ago that wanted to learn Carbon, Google's answer to C++. It's not even been released, had no compiler that was available, and is still (for all I know) in limbo today. If they just learned C or Java, they'd be in better shape.\n\nAlso, many programmers learn more than one language, so even if you never use C again, learning to program translates (somewhat) to learning new languages, so it's not wasted time even if you think it is wasted time. The fact is, to learn programming, you will ultimately \"waste time\". Avoiding mistakes often means avoiding learning.",

If the new size is still smaller than what you originally asked for, it's possible that realloc() might not do anything.\n* The total amount of memory used will increase with n, but because it's freeing what it had before, at most \"n\" memory will ever be taken up.\n* You might think 1 + 2 + 3 +... + n is some sort of exponential sort of thing, but it's just n\\^2.

Actual companies use Ticket systems and Project Frameworks, like Scrum, for a uni project that would be overkill though. \n\nGit for version control and order. The most popular free platform for git is by far Github. \n\nAnd then: Code Reviews!\n\nTo Junior Devs, Code Reviews seem scary as hell. Having someone else judge what I have written - what if it is crap? Also the feel like they could never review someone else's code.\n\nAll wrong. Everyone can review code. Especially one written by peers. Most of what I've learned ever was either a suggestion from someone reviewing my code or something I found while reviewing other people's code. Code Reviews are amazing!\n\nMaking sure no feature makes it into production, before one other person, that hasn't worked on it, has approved of what you did, will automatically improve the quality a lot!",

Apply your own thought process. You don't need to understand a programming language or concept to understand the logic behind the topics you are thinking about. Lock yourself in a room and think about the problem from the base case.\n\nFor example, why do you need a temp variable to store values when swapping in an array? Well, imagine you are organizing a stack of books. You want to move the one in the 5th position to the 3rd position in the stack. So aks yourself, what do you do? \n\nYou have some options! First, you could pick them up in your hands and move them to where you want them. Or second, you could pick one up, lets say the 2nd one, and shove it in after the 5th book, shoving every other book after it down, then take the 5th book and put it back where the 2nd book was. Or visa versa.\n\nSo which option is better? It's a lot harder to move a bunch of books after the 5th book just to shove that 2nd book in there. So lets pick them up and swap instead.\n\nYou pick up book 2, pick up book 5, and swap them. Ok, so if you wanted to do that on a computer, what's different? Well, you used your hand to store the books temporarily, so it's clear you have to put them somewhere when you swap. But actually, we can do better! Because in a computer things don't physically exist and it's all information, we can just pick one of them up, and copy the other into it's place. \n\nNow you can ask yourself, what would happen if I didn't pick up that book before copying over it? Well you'd no longer know what the book was, right? You'd lose all the content, all the pages, the title, everything about that book would have been replaced by the book you just copied into its place. \n\nThis is the thought process you have to apply to *any problem* you don't understand. Stand with the fundamentals. This actually has a name; \"principles first approach\". This is what I employ to most problems. As you gain more experience, you will start to see parallels and abstractions, and shortcuts you can take with the \"base case\".\n\nFor example, now that you know you need to store a variable temporarily, and you are asked how to swap elements in a binary tree, or rotate it, you can start your base case at the fact that you'll need at least one temporary variable.\n\nBest of luck \\~",

You may have missed the opportunity to break into the field. The time of being able to finish bootcamps and getting a job is mostly over now. Companies are expecting a lot more experience now than before. The self learning path is still possible, but doing it while having a child and needing to work another job while learning? Sounds very tough, and the needed skill floor being higher now also means it will take much longer than before. \n\nNow, if you are really really interested in it and not just doing it for the money then I would still say without a doubt go for it. The reason why I think this is an important difference for self learners is because the people with actual interest are always going to dive deeper into things. They are going to spend that extra hour or 2 working more when others feel like they have done enough for the day. Although, who knows, maybe in the next years we are going to have yet another boom where there will be so much work that any fresh bootcamp graduate can quickly land a job. For now, understand that this is not how it currently is and it may or may not change for many years so be realistic with yourself.

I learned through codecademy for basics then in my sales role out of college I built a tool for myself to automate some of my role. That became surprisingly successful despite being simple as hell (literally my first project ever). It was just a webscraper with beautiful soup 4. \n\nMy point is more so that the problem here is about hiring and understanding the market data. If you study it in depth (this is actually my educational background ie HR) yes there are less jobs and that has directly led to waaaaaaaay more applicants per posting which means a waaaaay smaller chance of your resume ever being seen by a human and its ultimately just making it clear how awful the entire hiring process always has been ... imo the worst process in the world by far and so companies are often relying on referrals from employees as they tend to work better given that the employees can typically be more trustworthy than a resume and team cohesion and ability to get along with the team is one of the most important things any typical hiring manager is gonna care about (not saying that this should be the case). \n\nSo why i bring up my case is that getting a job is just sales and referrals are a great way to do sales. If they know you and like you they will hire you. Especially at places that aren't truly NASA or OpenAI or FAANG. I personally feel that most job advice in this subreddit feels like its skewed towards those companies because they did truly use to hire 1000s of juniors but there's still millions of 20-50 person companies in non tech intensive industries that cant tell good from bad skill level to begin with and are hiring.\n\nI'll also add that no one told me about the functional programming job route and how surprisingly little competition there is for some of these companies. While some typical job postings will have over 1000 applicants these functional jobs will have less than 50 and even then its not hard to beat out the other 50 \n\nLastly the other nuance to share here is that alllll industries right now to the best of my knowledge are crap for hiring. I dont personally know if I can say that programming is worse for hiring than others? My fiancée for example works in the public sector and there's been 1000s of job cuts",

If I had had the chance to go to school I probably would’ve leaned more towards computer vision, embedded, graphics/media or something else but being self taught I took the pragmatic approach to enter the web dev arena. \n\nSo my advice would be to pick up whatever interests you most, because that’ll make you happiest in the long run. If you are enamored by the high salaries in big tech then stick to web dev or AI but plenty of places pay highly for specialized and niche knowledge.",

CSS is used to make them look nice. There are some data structures there (headings, paragraphs, captions, images, all that), but it is a stretch to claim you can code up actual algorithms in HTML/CSS. There's a lot more to programming than those. Javascript, for just one example.\n\nWhat kind of programs would you like to make for your users? Web apps? Games? Mobile apps? Controllers for washing machines and microwave ovens? Medical devices?  I am not sure how you would know the answer to these questions as a sophomore. Take some more classes. Look at Unity or Unreal Engine for games. Do the web app tutorials in Microsoft C# / Dotnet. \n\nAs for debugging your life, my response is this: \"It is functioning as designed.\" \n\nKeep on learning. Keep on coding.

That way the API interface and potential changes are isolated to a small part of the code instead of being sprinkled everywhere.\n\nGood luck!",

Some companies will give you some algorithmic coding challenge and immediately reject you if you don't score high enough. Another company might care deeply about your portfolio...but care far less about what you make and more about the specific tech stack used.\n\n\nReally though, if you can make a huge project that's relevant to already successful businesses, you are kind of leap-frogging an entry level position by a mile. That's like start-up territory.\n\n\nI've done a lot of new hire interviews... And while ever company is free to do whatever they want, in the three companies I've hired for, they all viewed portfolios the same way. It's mostly just talking point to bring up during the interview. \n\n\nIt's not a huge deal, in the general case.\n\n\nLots of applicants will have the same degree and a good GPA but, amazingly, some really will be awful at actually producing code. In the old days, whiteboard/quiz type questions were how we tried to see if someone really could code, but then everyone just started studying specifically for the type of questions that would be asked. \n\n\nI'm really not going to spend more than five minutes looking at a git repo or even a live website or whatever because there are just too many applicants and plenty of applicants are just going to clone somebody else's open source project. \n\n\nIt's just something I would ask you about in the interview. I would expect you to be mildly passionate about it, because it's your project, and I would expect you to be able to speak intelligently about how you built it, on a technical level. \n\n\nCounter-intuitively an amazing project can be a reason we don't hire you.\n\n\nIf we hire you, we would ask you to sign a non-compete and claim ownership of everything you develop. These contracts weren't always enforceable, and it might be different in your location, but the company wants you to give up your project and work full time on whatever they care about. \n\n\nIf your project is so good, so impressive, so huge, that we think in 6 or 12 months it might take off and you would quit to pursue it, you would be a high risk hire. We want the applicant who will stick around for a handful of years. \n\n\nOnly twice have I witnessed this. The first was a guy who clearly wanted to develop games. He had an indie game he was in love with and basically admitted he just wanted to make games but had run out of money. The other guy quit his full time job to launch his own app, wrote the app, and didn't sell as many copies as he thought. He was looking for a job but he was clearly super passionate about his app and wanted to keep working and focusing on it. \n\n\nAs a person, and a developer who has my own side projects, I get it. We just need some money to pay the bills...but as an employee tasked with hiring good candidates... Those people aren't likely to be the best options and selecting a bad hire reflects poorly on me.",

        "body": "\\> What is a github post?\n\nNever really heard the term used in regards to github, so I'm not sure what you mean.\n\n\\> Is it called a repository\n\nA repository is a collection of files that are managed by version control. Git is a particular version control software that is very popular. Github is a place where you can store repositories online so that it's not just only on your computer. (To understand the difference, I've heard \"Git is to GitHub as Porn is to PornHub.\" Meaning that porn exists outside pornhub, it's just one place to keep it, which is what makes it analagous.)\n\n\\> And is there a way to bookmark and or like a repository just like you would like a Facebook post or something on Instagram?\n\nGithub has stars, \"watch\" toggles, forks, and you can just use any standard way you'd bookmark a webpage too of course.\n\n\\> Could someone just give me a short synopsis of some of the terminology used on the site?\n\nIf you learn git separately from github, then I think most of the terms you'll understand.\n\nThe specialized terms are things like a \"pull request\" which wouldn't make sense on just your own computer, but that is you submiting code for someone elses' project and, well, requesting that they pull it into their project. That could be bug fixes or feature implementations or documentation or anything else that makes sense for the project that the original author/maintainer might be interested in. There's also all kinds of options for automatically testing or building, or project management, etc. Frankly no one uses every feature, just the features relevant to their own workflow.\n\n\\> I want to use it more but I just don’t understand any of the different things you can do.\n\nMost of the things it can do won't make sense without knowing git.\n\n\\> Just to give you an idea, I didn’t build my PC just because I didn’t want to mess it up.\n\nEntirely understandable (although maybe I'm more reckless than you since I'm currently trying to fix my GPU with a soldering iron lol), and actually tangentially related to one of the problems version control/git aims to solve. By using git you can keep a history of all the versions of a file with a little note about what changed. That means if something gets messed up, you can maybe not \"easily\" but relatively easily go back to a version where everything in the file/project was in a good state and move on from there rather than hopiing you kept your \"known\\_good\\_backup\\_file.py\" actually unmodified.\n\n\\> main features someone like me who is not a programmer would need to know to work my way around it.\n\nHonestly as a non-programmer probably the main thing to do would be to submit \"issues\" for projects you use that you would notice a bug or miissing feature or whatever in. The exact way to do that varies for every project since everyone has their own preferences, but in general it's appreciated to get feedback from people actually using the tools you make.\n\n\\> I have used a couple posts to my benefit but each time had someone walk me through setting it up and after that, didn’t have to revisit it so it’s all a foreign language to me.\n\nUnfortunately git is just weird, and it takes a little bit of time forcing yourself to use it to get used to it. Ultimately there's like 5-10 common commands but there's way more than that in the tool so it's more intimidatting than it needs to be. Some non-programmers like book authors sometimes appreciate the \"time travel\" ability that it gives them, so it's possible that even without writing code that there's something youd' appreciate using version control for which would help you build up a little more of a habit of using git.",

While I can encourage learning either, if you're just starting out, it's better to follow what the university would teach you. It may be either C++, Java, or other programming languages like Python.\n\nFor me, I've learned Java in my first year of college. As a quick description, Java is pretty verbose and specific on how it does Object Oriented Programming, so it's pretty word-y but you may have a strong background of OOP. I haven't learned C++ so I can't say much other than it being a more low level language while still being familiar in terms of syntax. In reality though you would start learning either flow charts or pseudocodes before going to write things using a programming language before Data Structures and Algorithms (at least that's how I started in my college)",

Just not sure what kind of personal projects actually help when applying for junior or entry level roles.\n\nGenerally, I would focus on creating projects that:\n\n- Use the stack / technologies you want to use in practice, or want to get a job in. While not completely necessary, as you can show general software development aptitude by simply creating programs that work, having them also be using the technologies a company you are applying for immediately shows your general skill level to the person doing the interview with you.\n- Write applications that excite or interest you personally. You will find that in an interview just being able to talk about a project that interests you will convey genuine interest in our field of work. Personally as an interviewer, I am always very interested in hearing about projects people have written just because it interests them. \n- Document your projects, and make them representable. I like seeing Github URLs on applicant their CVs, but interviewers are likely not going to check out more than 1-3 projects. Pin or highlight the projects you are most proud of, provide them with good documentation, if possible with screenshots or in case of a web app: a demo website. Make it easy to run. Your goal is to entice the interviewer to check out the code, and maybe even clone your repo in order to do so.\n  - Your Emotion-AiCbot repo is a good example of this. Your custom-domain and medstuff repo's not so much. \n- Try and make your projects non-trivial. I do not get excited by projects like calculator or to-do apps. These are simple applications, and there are a bunch of prebaked tutorials for those on the internet. Created some niche application for your hobby, or which you use in your day-to-day life? Way more interesting.\n\n> I’m more into backend stuff, like APIs and automations, but I can handle some frontend too. Just not sure what kind of personal projects actually help when applying for junior or entry level roles.\n\nKnow that as a junior engineer, my expectation would be that you quickly pick up technologies and are a rapid learner. Try not to limit yourself too early in your development by preferring only certain types of task (e.g. back-end). Certainly do get proficient with at least one front-end technology, or you will not stand out among junior developers that are skilled in multiple domains.\n\nBest of luck.",

This is kind of what a binary search tree is doing.\n\nLisp has a built-in \"dotted\" notation for cons cells, so you can just write example trees out to test your lookups, for example.

Once you’re solid with that, binary trees become easier: it’s just two references instead of one (left and right).\n\nThen, build a simple Node class for your tree. Keep it minimal: just value, left, and right.\n\nNow, draw a small tree on paper and simulate what’s supposed to happen step by step:\n\nHow insertion flows,\n\nHow recursion works (base case + call stack),\n\nHow traversal happens (in-order, pre-order, post-order).\n\n\nUse a debugger or print() statements to watch the logic unfold live. That’s how you bridge the gap between understanding the concept and writing working code.\n\nFinally — don’t rush. Trees teach you recursion, memory structure, and flow control all at once. So if it’s hard, that just means you’re learning something real.\n\nYou're closer than you think.\n\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a sample in Python or a visual breakdown. Happy to help",

        "body": "I professionally work on a large codebase (~50+ million lines of code) containing a mix of backend and frontend code. We pretty much exclusively use plain-old dependency injection and do not quite use the service locator pattern.\n\nThis is partly due to the architecture of our codebase, which is a monorepo containing a bunch of microservices. That is, we have one giant repo where all code lives, and the code contains several thousand smaller programs that are managed by different teams and deployed independently at cadences picked by the owning team. (The monorepo + microservice approach makes it easier for each team to move independently while still making it easy to share + reuse + mass-refactor code, etc.)\n\nGiven this setup, having a central registry is not hugely useful because:\n\n1. If we create just one 'registry library' that everybody adds their thing to, it ends up introducing a major bottleneck to builds and tests. When we make a code change, our build system + CI pipeline tries building and testing only code that ends up depending on that code change in some way; having a single common module that nearly every microservice takes a dep on would add an unnecessary bottleneck.\n2. You don't really get much benefit out of having every single microservice create their own registry and register deps. If you're going through the hassle of this, you may as well just pass in those dependencies directly into your code and skip setting up the intermediary registry.\n\nBeyond this though, I personally think service locators are inferior to plain-old-code and dependency injection in general because:\n\n1. Having the dependencies be statically encoded in the source code instead of created dynamically via some magic framework makes it easier for IDEs and static analysis tools to determine where exactly different snippets of code are being used, programmatically update the code, more intelligently pick which tests must be run given certain code changes, perform type checking, etc. So, the less dynamic/runtime wiring we can have, the better.\n2. It also makes unit testing easier -- there's nothing simpler then just calling a plain-old-function or instantiating a plain-old-class. The less ceremony you can have, the better.\n3. Arguably service locators make it a little too easy to add new deps. Code that takes a large number of deps is usually a sign of poorly-designed code -- it should be broken up into smaller, better compartmentalized components. So, having a little bit of friction here seems like a pro, not a con.\n\nAll that said, it's true that these microservices need a way to communicate with each other -- need some sort of [service discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_discovery). This has less to do with code architecture and more to do with the reality that these microservices need to run on a fleet of many thousands of hosts, and so need a way of discovering which IP address any particular microservice replica is serving from at any given time.\n\nTo do this, we have microservices register their IP address in a system that's pretty similar to DNS; downstream microservices need to hard-code the specific service address and perform a lookup to talk to other microservices they take a dep on.\n\nIn fairness, the actual code to do all of the above can end up feeling pretty similar to the service locator pattern in practice -- it's just that instead of registering a pointer, we register IP addresses. So, I suppose we _do_ use a variant of this pattern in practice.\n\n> are multithreaded\n\nI think multi-threadness is irrelevant here. If your code is multi-threaded, your deps need to be thread-safe, no matter how they're passed around.",

Because a service locator provides that. \n\nJust as an example with my context, I use service locators in game development to provide convenient access to main systems (audio, saving, scene loading).

        "body": "Dependency injection has some pros over the service locator pattern:\n\n1. **No hidden dependencies!** \\- You know exactly what dependencies an object has just by looking at its constructor, and what dependencies a method has just by looking at its parameter list. You don't have to read through all the implementation details, or figure out through trial-and-error, what services need to be registered in your service locator for things to not break at runtime. If all required dependencies are explicitly listed as constructor and method parameters, the compiler makes it basically impossible to try and construct an object or execute a method without having everything in the right place for it to work (at least if the services passed to the client themselves also use dependency injection, etc.).\n2. **Safer async initialization** \\- If a service returned from a service locator requires some sort of asynchronous initialization before all its methods are ready to be used, then it could easily lead to a situation where a client forgets to check some IsReady property before calling some method, resulting in bugs. Or even if the service is explicitly registered as wrapped inside a promise object, then all clients need the additional complexity of handling waiting for the service to become ready, and unwrapping it. With dependency injection you can naturally always just wait for all services to be fully ready before you even initialize the client and pass them to its constructor. Thus all clients' code can remain very simple and focused, and the asynchronous nature of a few services don't end up spreading around the code base, and causing the whole APIs of all their clients to also become asynchronous in nature.\n3. **Better support for multiple services of the same type** \\- with dependency injection, you can easily at any time pass completely different services to separate instances of the same client type. You can pass a default logger to most of them, but pass a more verbose logger to that one instance that you want to debug more closely right now. If you use a global service locator, then you might just be completely stuck with all instances of a client class being stuck using the same services at any given time. Or even if you use multiple separate service locators, it'll still probably be much way more complicated to swap the service of one client instance in some particular context - potentially even requiring some substantial architectural changes to pull it off.\n4. **Clients don't have to worry about lifetime management** \\- if a client pulls out a service from a service locator, how do they know if they should dispose of it once they no longer need it? Did they get a transient service, or is it a singleton shared between multiple instances? Does the service locator have to return some other information besides the requested service, so that this can be resolved? Do clients just always have to return all services to the service locator, just in case? With dependency injection all the complexity of lifetime management is pulled out from all the many clients in your codebase, and can be centralized into a smaller number of composition roots, where the lifetimes of all the different services is probably more clear.\n5. **Clear initialization order** \\- if services are initialized lazily by a service locator, in whatever order they're requested by clients, then their initialization order can become an unknowable, unpredictable black box, where the order of initialization can change drastically due to small changes in the implementation details of clients. This can potentially lead to random spooky-action-at-a-distance bugs, where a small change to some object causes a chain effect, resulting in some event being raised before some service has had time to subscribe to it, causing things to silently break. With (pure) dependency injection the initialization order is super clear, and doesn't just suddenly change \"by itself\" without you being aware of what has happened.",

The brief window where files are accessible before metadata stripping or malware scanning is pretty normal most companies accept that low risk in exchange for smooth UX.\n\nSome common patterns I’ve seen:\n\nSingle bucket, async processing\n\nUser uploads → file is public/private in S3 almost immediately\n\nLambda/SQS/SNS triggers run in the background:\n\nStrip EXIF / metadata\n\nResize or generate thumbnails\n\nOptionally scan with ClamAV or an external scanning service\n\nOnce processed, either overwrite the file or mark it “safe” for serving\n\nTwo‑bucket flow while this is safer, it's slower \n\nTemporary “quarantine” bucket for raw uploads\n\nProcess + scan → copy to “public” bucket → CDN serves only from that bucket\n\nAdds latency but avoids serving unprocessed content\n\n\nHybrid\n\nSingle bucket, but the file is uploaded private by default\n\nProcessing Lambda flips ACL to public or moves it to a processed/ folder only after passing checks\n\nThis avoids serving potentially unsafe files without delaying uploads.",

People learnt way before the internet with its countless tutorials existed.\n\nYour approach is definitely not the very worst one, but you also have some typical misconceptions: just because you can *read and understand* code doesn't automatically mean you could *write* it, just as much as being able to *read and understand* novels won't automatically enable you to *write* a meaningful, fully developed one. You need to *practice yourself*.\n\nFurther, focusing on the code is generally the wrong approach. Code is only the *end product* of a long train of decisions, thoughts, considerations, and planning. What happens *before* the actual code, the design, is what really counts.\n\nSure, you may be able to implement X, but what's the reason to implement X in the way it is done? What are the design decisions and considerations that led to this specific implementation.\n\nYou need to learn to *design*. You need to learn to sit down with a problem and to analyze and break it down into smaller sub-problems that can be solved individually and *then*, finally, be implemented in code (in any language you know).\n\nYou, like way too many people, are trying to fast-track and are focusing too much on the end-product, instead of on the process of getting there.\n\nMy recommendation is to not use AI to give you solutions of any kind (code or not does not matter), only to give deeper explanations, as a glorified \"google\".",

Don't just build a working calculator with ChatGPT, do it in under 15 minutes. Write an HTTP server in Typescript, a compiler in C and a 3D rendering engine in Python. Make every project more challenging than a previous one and you will quickly stop hesitating about ChatGPT over-reliance and start ranting about it's limitations and read the docs & dive into fundamentals because you have to.",

If someone acting non-maliciously can break something it’s a failure of the process, not a failure on the individual engineer. \n\nThe best thing to do here is own up to the mistake and work with the entire team to recover it. It absolutely sucks to have to tell everyone about your mistake, but it’s always the best option to be transparent and lead the effort to fix it than to try and keep it quiet and hope no one notices, because if you do so it always turns into a bigger problem.\n\nOnce you fix things, the next best thing is to write up a post-mortem report outlining what happened, the recovery process, the root cause, and any learning items or action items the team should take to avoid a similar incident from happening again.",

Here's the deal:\n\nYou're right that coding isn’t just about syntax or solving tons of questions, it’s about learning to think computationally. That means breaking problems into smaller steps, organizing your logic, and gradually building up solutions. It’s a muscle, not a gift, and it takes time and the right kind of practice.\n\nInstead of rushing through LeetCode, start small and deliberately:\n\nPick simple problems (like on Exercism, Codewars, Edabit, or even structured platforms like Dataquest) and write out your thought process before coding anything.\n\nRead “*How to Solve It”* by Polya, it’s not about code, but about how to approach problems methodically.\n\nWatch CS50 lectures (especially the problem-solving parts), and go through hands-on projects like “*Build Your Own X* “ when you're ready.\n\nAlso, don’t panic when you get stuck. Practice tracing code with pen and paper, talking through your logic, and working with a study group or mentor if possible. Avoid relying on AI tools until you've tried solving it on your own first. They can short-circuit your growth if you're not careful.\n\nYou're not broken mate, you're just now learning how to actually learn CS. And that realization? It's a huge win. Keep showing up, focus on depth over quantity, and the improvement will come.\n\n ",

Make sure you're understanding why it works though and not just how to do it, thats a pitfall a lot of people fall into when learning anything. \n\nAlso I personally dont use ChatGPT to write any code. If i use it its usually for syntax issues (usually when learning a new language) or as a substitute for google. \n\nSorry I cant help more and im personally wondering the same question tbh. Its definetly hard to know when your competant enough to try and work in this field, but just make sure your always learning and try to always have fun doing it. :)\n\nEDIT: Typos",

You don't need to know everything as Google and AI exists (no programmer knows everything) but you need to build projects to learn how a project is constructed from start to finish and what is also important is that you don't use AI to solve problems. Struggling is part of the learning process and you only can learn debugging for example if your code, that you wrote yourself doesn't work and you go through it line by line trying to understand why the output is not what you want it to be. Like mentioned above theory is important too as you need to know that certain syntax even exists but then using this syntax so your brain gets used to it you can only learn by doing projects. Once you think you learned Javascript or Typescript for example (like you said you did), start a project and see if you know what to do. If the answer is you don't know then you need to spend more time with it until you can build a project yourself before moving on. \nI think even if you can get a job you will feel much more comfortable if you have done several projects.\n Like many here say, programming is not a sprint but a marathon.

There are two approaches. The first is polling, which is fine if updates can be delayed by a bit. iPhone email polls. The second is the CometD protocol which keeps a long lived socket open between client and server that closes after either a three minute timeout or when a “push” update is returned. This is inefficient in terms of open tcp sockets for the server and cannot massively scale but can support client counts in the thousands or tens of thousands.\n\nIf you control the servers, you would allow inbound connections to the database and secure that point using a firewall and likely a vpn for an internal server. You would also strictly authenticate connections including restricting senders to known ip ranges. A common strategy is to route traffic through the vpn and only permit connections from it unless a device is physically in an office and authenticated on a trusted network.",

That API server is then allowed to open connections to the private IP of the database server (possibly via some complicated networking or handshaking thing verifying that only the right process/user/machine can reach it). But that's if \"public IP\" means \"internet\" and not \"any other PC.\" \n\nIf you need it so that the database server can't be reached by anybody, then you're in trouble. \"Immediately\" means you want a direct connection between the API server and the database, but \"only outbound connections\" means you need the database to initiate the connection to the API server, and that's a configuration mess. If you have lots of API servers, your database would need to connect to all of them and manage reconnecting to any that die. You could certainly build a solution for that, but why?",

I actually get a little thrill when I get a rejection email (I’d ballpark it at about 10% of my applications actually receiving a rejection). You have layers of AI filtering before you can even get to a human. And I can assure you that the AI filters do not care about the super exciting hike I went on last weekend even if it could create that moment of good vibes with a human that you are emphasizing.\n\nThe hiring system IS adversarial. It’s turned into a sheer numbers game, a game of maximizing your odds of getting through the AI filters and still coming out vaguely believable on the other side. If I actually got a chance to speak with people regularly, I’d have a much different approach to how I apply, believe me. But I simply can’t afford to spend an hour retranslating my life experience into a bespoke application for every job listing when I know there is a very low chance anyone is even going to look at it and a lower chance I’ll beat out the other 300 people who applied for it within the first 5 minutes of it being listed.\n\nAnd while my heart goes out to all the gainfully employed hiring managers who find pressing a \nbutton to blanket filter out candidates a bit distasteful, I can assure you it feels infinitely worse on the other side where there are *actual* stakes (like can I feed my family next month).\n\nAgain, I’m not trying to trash you or anything. I really do appreciate the tips and plan to make use of them as much as possible.

Apparently the whole thing was a psychological test designed to drill down on something the candidate says they know until they reach the end of their knowledge. You succeed by saying “I don’t know”.

His resume was famously bullshit, filled with a fake graduation from the University of Georgia and founding engineer roles at startups that didn't exist. I want you to think long and hard about the fact that this man, by lying about every single facet of his life, was not only able to have his resume seen, but waved past several rounds of hiring managers at all the biggest corps in silicon valley. You need to accept the fact that you've built a system that optimizes for exactly this type of candidate. \n\nEvery problem that every hiring manager posts about on here has such obvious solutions that aren't being implemented. Every manager who posts on here about receiving too many applicants all seem to not want to just auto reject applications that are from outside the country. They all seem to not want to hire from whatever colleges or universities are near them. They all seem to want to have as much of the hiring process handled over zoom or by automation as possible. If you are a small bank in Omaha Nebraska that needs some entry level engineers and you list the job globally on indeed and zip recruiter rather than listing it on your company website and having your recruiter reach out to the local college for recent graduates then you deserve every single bullshitter and scammer who gums up your hiring process.",

I ask cause Ive been told by other SWEs to add more hard numbers which I can do, but it does feel hard knowing how to do it without feeling a little fake (capturing these metrics in production is not always clear). I don't really use AI for talking to people or in the interviewing process proper but it does feel like the job market is changing very quickly so it's hard to know what advice is still valid, especially as other people in the thread pointed out the best advice may be context dependent for where you're applying. Good post, I think it's really helpful getting a detailed perspective that fleshed out how people at startups may think differently about this problem!",

I had to learn all these on the job. In CS, you're always learning on the job. Java 7 was mainstream when I started, now I see companies using Java 14 or later. The degree teaches you CS theory and fundamentals and proves you have some work ethic and coding ability. University prestige matters greatly for your first job.\n\nYou can cycle back to CS and be entry level. The consulting industry won't care if you did something else for years but won't count that work experience. I'm not sure the job market is going to be any better. Unless I see proof of CS declining below [100,000 degrees per year](https://archive.is/mPNcX) in North America, I just see the squeeze tightening.\n\nBusiness minor, I think you saw that you can't list minors on job applications. Got to upsell during a job interview. At least you have MBA prereqs knocked out. Perhaps you could manage CS in the future. Nice that you know how to code but won't disagree with the devs on how long things take. Worst manager is a rusty coder who acts like they're not rusty. I had some database polite disagreements.",

Some spent many more years learning the craft and struggling for a job before finding success. If she really wants this, keep encouraging and tell her to stick it out, but be prepared to work harder for longer. She needs to be ready to take a job she doesn't like.

Ultimately, you gotta decide what is it that you want to do. \n\n\nI recommend that you don’t prioritize what you love or are passionate about. Obviously it is amazing if you love/are passionate about your career, but that does not give you much flexibility. It’s fine if you don’t stay in CS/SWE, but I think the answer for leaving should be more nuanced than “it’s not my passion”.\n\nSo to dig into that a bit deeper, why did you get into software development 6 years ago? Have the reasons back then changed? You mentioned that sometimes you wish you never had to look at code again, is there a specific reason why? Are those reasons innate to coding itself or the conditions of your workplace? One way you can test that question is by trying to learn some fundamental computer science theory. TBF this is an assumption, but I strongly suspect your bootcamp set you up to learn programming languages and frameworks and it didn’t teach you the fundamentals and theory of computer science. I think that’s important to learn in order to develop some passion since it makes the field an actual study, not a traded skill.\n\nI’ll use history as an example since that was your major. A lot of people don’t like history because they see it as just the practice of accounting of the events that happened in the past. To them, it feels like there’s “history” and there’s “current events” and the two aren’t connected much in their view. But a historian will understand how history is both a representation of the past and current events. They understand how history gives us a critical basis for evaluating human sociology, economics, politics, etc.\n\nThere’s an analogous experience that a SWE can have with coding and computer science. It’s obviously not going to get nearly into humanities studies like history, but its conceptualizations extend in their own ways in surprising ways.\n\n\nIf you read this and think “I really don’t care about any of that and I have no will to invest my time in that”, that’s totally fair and it would give you important feedback for your dilemma. \n\nAt the end of the day, whether you are passionate about it or not, you gotta have a mind that is curious to explore your professional field. If your mindset is similar to that as a cashier who doesn’t wish to expand their skillset in retail, then you’ll remain stagnant just as a cashier will. It may feel like you shouldn’t be stagnant since you obviously work in a field that requires more skills than being a cashier. But stagnation isn’t about where you are currently. It’s about how you are growing. \n\n\nTL;DR: Try to invest more time in learning CS fundamentals and theory to see if it will give you a  new perspective for finding interests in this field. If it doesn’t or you do not want to do that, then you’ll remain stagnant should consider what would you be willing to do that for and how can you make a career with that.",

Two were with engineers, each technical but only pretty basic coding and mostly conversational. Then a final call with the engineering department director. It's a <100 person company, maybe 30 engineers.\n\nIt's by far the shortest / least intense interview I've gone through, and I pretty much only interview for companies around that size or smaller. Most everywhere does 4+ rounds if you're including the intro call, but more than 5 is pretty unusual, and I am including \"take home exercise\" as a round.\n\nMost typical interview loops are:\n\n* Recruiter screen\n* Hiring manager screen\n* Technical round (often a take home)\n* Deeper technical round (common if last was a take home)\n* Final call with someone important (CTO, director, etc)\n\nStep 3 is *super* common when compared to 2020-2022, but sometimes rounds 2-3-4 there are combined in some way. Occasionally there will be no final round and it goes right to offer stage after the big technical round. It's also pretty common for the deep round to just be a discussion of the take home.\n\nShortest I've ever had was screen, conversational with HM, then a technical. After that was offer phase. 3 rounds was more common in 2015-2020, I think, but I've found that losing the in-person technical round to remote interviewing has made the process longer pretty much across the board.",

If you're interviewing for a medium-sized company (100-500 employees, I don't go smaller as the pay will be much lower), you will have 2 interviews: a technical one with a one to three engineers and a behavioural on-site one with an HR and probably someone ranking between your future team lead to the head of development. \n\nThe technical interview REALLY depends on the company. I'm interviewing for C++ positions, so the company will ask you questions about the non-trivial part of the language most relevant to them (examples are virtual methods, exceptions, thread synchronization, templates, stuff like that). They will also ask you general language and data structure questions(examples: the differences between map and unordered_map and between list and vector), and they might throw a leetcode-like problem in to see whether you understand concepts like big-O notation. Some companies can also ask you a bunch of really low-level questions where you'll need to know about alignment, big-endian vs little-endian, and the C standard library.\n\nThe behavioural interview is the basic HR questions(like \"what was your biggest fuckup?\" and \"why are you switching jobs?\"). One company I worked at gave me a personality test, but it was a legit one developed by scientists for professional orientation purposes, not something like MBTI(and the company itself was really nice and chill). \n\nThe entire process takes 2-3 weeks. They can even come with the positive feedback on the day of the interview. Then they give you a couple of weeks to think about their offer. The job afterwards is usually much more chill than in our Big Techs.",

The 200+ applicant pools are more common now, but your experience and realistic salary expectations could set you apart from fresh bootcamp grads demanding Silicon Valley wages.\n\nRegional markets vary significantly. Smaller cities and non-tech hubs often have less competition and more reasonable processes. You can use a service like Applyre to do a passive job search while you're still in your current situation. Local consulting firms, government contractors, and established businesses modernizing their systems are good targets.\n\nYour timing might actually work in your favor.

I was a paper millionaire. YEAH BABY I'M RICH!!! Yeah not so fast, lol.\n\nThis happened right as the bubble started to deflate. By the time I had vested 1/4 of my options and could sell anything, the stock price fell 35-40%. And it kept on falling and falling and falling. Layoffs started happening, and by the time my number was called, about 7/8 months later, about 60% of employees had been let go. Stock price was in the toilet. But my strike price was really low, so it was still something. From my several millions on paper, I ended up getting about $75K out of it. Not horrible. That would be worth about $150-160K today. Not life changing money, but enough to put a downpayment on a couple of houses. Which in turn appreciated to where it is life changing money. So indirectly I guess I did get those millions.\n\nOnce I was laid off, I chilled out for about 2 months, I played a lot of golf. I got a pretty good severance package, IIRC 3 months of salary and health insurance for 6 months. Or maybe the other around. It was 20+ years ago I don't remember all the details. I wasn't really worried about money as I had lived fairly frugally and socked away a lot. Plus I had the option money.\n\nI ended up moving to a LCOL mid sized city and got a job there. My salary was much lower than what I had been making before. But accounting for the difference in cost of living as well as taxes (I moved from ultra high tax state to ultra low tax state) I was right about even.\n\nIt was a wild ride and it was exciting. It was a place and time that was special. I loved the experience. Plus I met so many people back then that I am still in touch with today. One of them started a company himself. He asked me to join, I would have bene employee 4 or 5, something like that. I passed thinking, dude no way this will ever become anything, look around you tech is dead. That company was later sold to Microsoft for MUCHO MUCHO money. Oh well, win some lose some.",

It sounds like you’ve reached a terminal position at this current company. \n\nYou could try making some noise and seeing whether you get any support from the higher-ups in working towards goals that help you become a senior. But at 4 years, idk. \n\nI’m in a similar position to you, 3.5 years in and officially considered mid, but I know I offer much more than that. But I’ve got a pretty good deal all things considered, so I’ve let go of any resentment and just contribute as much as I need and not extra, unless absolutely required (I’m not very visible, but sometimes I might be when other teammates are out). \n\nBasically, I prefer being an IC vs. leading projects because there’s much less scrutiny and the routine is much more chill. I even talked to a teammate who is leading a project, and they’re questioning whether the visibility is worth it lol. I’ve had the chance in the past and I knew that it’s not something I’m into. \n\nI also keep up with the latest advancements in the field, primarily in terms of AI. I know I have the passion and drive in me, so I don’t attach a lot of worth to my title anymore. ",

But it's a VC funded hype bubble. There's going to be a lot of losers in a few years. And imo, that VC money is way better off in the hands of average engineers like you or I.\n\n\nI say take a stab at it. You have the credentials, both academic and professional. And you could probably ask for some ridiculous pay/options/stock contracts.\n\n\nYou literally have everything to gain and nothing to lose seeing as you have stable employment. My general take: if you have the skills and the ability to do so, get aboard the hype train while money grows on trees, get your bag, and gtfo. ",

I’ll warn that to someone with my level of experience it’s obvious that this sub is full of people who are barely into their career, and people who have done very little research into other careers.\n\nI can get another job easily even in this economy. It would be hard to get a job that pays as much as my current job does, but I’d still be making at least $180k. There’s very, very few other careers that can say something similar short of becoming a doctor. The reality is that becoming a software engineer is still one of your best options.\n\nBreaking into this career is hard. But so is breaking into most careers worth pursuing, and at the end other options will generally offer lower rewards than this one. If you network well, apply seriously and broadly, and do proper interview prep, eventually you’ll land something. I started out in a QA role that paid me less then my pizza delivery job, now I make nearly $300k.\n\nFar too many people in this sub preach about how you have to be passionate about software. That’s bull. The majority of the highly successful engineers I know, I’m talking people making over $300k, are very transparent they are only in it for the money. Passion isn’t a requirement. Being willing to work hard is. If anything the passionate people were the ones who tend to get suckered into longer hours and lower pay.\n\nThe only career people can even try to compare with the perks of software engineering is the trades, and that’s largely coming from people who don’t know much about the trades and are parroting what they’ve heard. The trades, on average, don’t pay nearly as much as software engineering. There are some exceptions, but even those tend to only pay the level of highly skilled senior software engineers, if we compare them to the exceptions for software engineers then engineering pay still generally blows the trades out of the water.\n\nTrade jobs that pay well are also highly competitive, trade jobs are limited to in person job opportunities, they’re incredibly hard on your body, they often require long hours, and they are rampant with sexism such that it’s hardly even a real option for women. Depending on where you live your race might also be a problem for the trades. If it were as easy to make a ton of money in the trades as some people pretend it is then everyone would do it. Yeah things are hard for software engineers now, but things are hard for everyone now. Computer science is still likely the best career for people willing to do the work. I’m not saying computer science will be easy. I’m saying nothing worth pursuing will be.",

        "body": "I’m a software engineer with 19 years work experience. There will always be a need for software engineers as technology progresses. \n\nHere are the things you need to know, not immediately but keep them in mind:\n\n1. New tech is always coming out, so you have to be comfortable constantly learning. For example, you should absolutely be taking classes about AI, ML, and LLMs in college. 10 years from now, there will be something else. You can’t just sit on knowledge in this field like in other fields, you have to keep learning or you get left behind. \n\n2. Microsoft tech stack isn’t used many places outside of government. Focus on Python and/or Java, as they are the two most popular in the real world. Learn fullstack eventually so you understand how the systems interact. \n\n3. Learn system design. You will learn more about the components in college, the earlier you learn this the better. Hellointerview is really good for this. \n\n4. Obviously DSA is critical. You need to be very comfortable with this. You will learn it in college, but getting started early can’t hurt. Lots of resources online. \n\n5. Learn cloud. Again, Microsoft tech isn’t used much. AWS is king, followed by google cloud. I would recommend learning AWS. You don’t have to be an expert but learn how to use it and what the different parts do. \n\n6. Make a GitHub account and work on projects. Especially anything cloud related and/or AI related. \n\n7. Don’t buy CS books (except school books). Everything you need can be found online, for free. \n\n8. I would recommend taking computer engineering instead of computer science, if you can. It’s half CS and half electrical engineering. You will learn how both the software and hardware work together, and if you decide you like hardware better, you can easily pivot to EE.\n\n9. Learn CI/CD fundamentals. Again, you don’t have to be an expert, but understanding how real releases to production work will help you be a more mature software engineer. Be comfortable setting up a build in something like Jenkins or Azure DevOps, for example. \n\n10. Learn version control. Git is by far the most popular. \n\n——\n\n\nMaybe I’ll add more if I think of anything else. But yeah, don’t get discouraged. There are definitely lots of people looking for jobs but it’s a great field and pays very well. You are always learning new things and always challenged, and you get to work with smart people.",

Right now I feel very much stuck at my current role because it's basically the ONLY option I have (it's not gonna stop me from continuing to apply though! 😎).\n\nI definitely caved into the CS influencers which was a big mistake. Had I known that it would've been hit as hard as it did, I would've gone into something else (probably medical or another engineering discipline). I will say that I do love coding, and a huge caveat is that I love frontend coding but don't care too much about being hands-on with backend/ML. The market is catered towards backend/ML and honestly wouldn't be surprised if frontend engineers specifically gets hit even more. So, as other people have commented, if you truly are passionate and dedicate yourself to fundamentals (use AI as a TOOL, not a solution!), then it will definitely pay off. I'm someone who is big in the life part of WLB, and I can say that this field doesn't really cater towards those type of people.",

You need to say what languages were used in your first two projects. Most people don't know what Flutter is. Then you need to expand your Technical Skills. Don't just say Java, add Spring Boot, Postgres with JDBC, Hibernate mapping, other Spring modules, any IDEs used. If same info is within your Java project, that's fine, have it in two places so HR is more likely to read.\n\nThen consider an MS to \"reset\" your work gap and be eligible for internships again.

In 5th grade we had to write a report and publically present it about \"What I want to be when I grow up\". A bunch of kids picked things like professional baseball player, firefighter, cop, \"business man\", etc.\n\nI wrote my report on wanting to be a \"Computer Scientist\".\n\nI wasn't even pursing SWE specifically. I wanted to get a CS degree, and find *any* technical job that utilized my CS degree. So from day 1 I was ride-or-die CS/tech-industry.\n\nBut around 10-12 years into my career, my mind has started drifting to simpler times. When I was a teenager, I worked in fast food, and it was one of the best jobs of my life. I literally met life long friends through that job that I still keep in touch with. It's what really brought me out of my shell as an awkward teen, it was pretty formative for my life.\n\nThe pay was shit, dealing with customers is god awful, but the job itself was very \"zen\". I go in, I sling some burgs for 6-12 hours, and I go home. There's no week/month-long projects, there's no quarterly objectives, there's no product managers, there's no on call, there's nothing to think about after work. It's just burgers. The only thing that followed me after my shifts was I always smelled like beef.\n\nBut around 10 YOE? I already got my bag. I literally have enough money stashed away that I could afford to work a full time minimum wage job for the rest of my life and not sacrifice anything about my current lifestyle. So when my last job went south, and I started looking for my current one.... I kept thinking \"what if I just... went back to fast food\". I made a spreadsheet to forecast my runway.\n\nUltimately I'm glad I stuck with it and landed my current job.... but I am at the point where if I get laid off, or this job goes south, \"soft-retiring\" is a very realistic option for me.\n\nMy passion in CS and computers is still as strong as ever. But I don't need to work in the industry to enjoy that side of my life anymore.",

Depending on your experience/qualifications, maybe even be open to that for 5-6 years.\n\nOtherwise, I'd probably start becoming desperate enough to involuntarily relocate around the 4-6 month mark. It's also important to point out how the job search itself is going would change how desperate I am.... Am I not even getting interviews? I'd be very desperate, I'd be open to relocating on the earlier side. Am I getting interviews, but just not offers? This is significantly easier to fix, I'd be working on this in month 1, let alone month 4... but if I'm getting a decent amount of bites I'd be freaking out closer to the 6 months mark.\n\nAt that stage I also wouldn't *only* be open to relocating. I'd be expanding my job search to consider non-SWE roles that my CS degree qualifies me for.

Work on those, ask quesitons, etc but at the same time: \n\n  \n\\- Learn the version control system / branching strategy / release schedule / rollback policies etc better than anyone else in the organization. You'll find that most people are fuzzy on large parts of it and you'll be able to solve and prevent many problems simply by not being fuzzy.\n\n\\- Find out where all the documentation is and start reading it. It will be of varying quality and often out of date but get comfortable with the org's business, architecture, network infrastructure, personnel structure, etc.\n\n\\- Talk to as many people as you can, in all roles and departments. Learn what they do. You will eventually save someone from a million dollar mistake because you will have awareness of things that no one else does. Make people like you and see you as useful. You will get many more opportunities that way.\n\n\\- Learn your tools and technology stack deeply. In the AI era it's more important than ever. It just takes a few books. Learn everything about Java, be able to talk about the major features that were added at various milestones and why you would use them. Same with Spring or whatever else you're using.",

Some things I did:\n\nI slowed down how fast I spoke. This helped me think more before I speak.\n\nI also started getting comfortable with the pauses. You DON'T have to constantly keep speaking. If you feel you are losing track of thought, just slow down, recollect your thoughts and then speak. Most people think you need to keep talking and in such cases use weird filler words which end up sounding less authoritative.\n\nUse these documents that I spoke about in the post. For eg a quick 1-pager doc that highlights what you want to discuss basically acts as a meeting agenda and lays down all the things that need to be discussed - that way you don't have to remember / memorize anything. If that is too much, then just note down the main points that you want to discuss on a sticky note or something. In my experience, if I have a clear structure that helps me navigate from one point to another, I have less chance to lose track of thought.\n\nLmk if that helps.

Instead of trying to cram yourself into that box, I would lean into the advantages of your position and away from the disadvantages you have in the traditional entry level pipeline.\n\nI would think about your plant very deeply, and find problems within the plant that are technology problems. I would then prioritize them by a combination of how valuable they are to the business (like how much they move earnings), how much delivery of that thing would prove your ability as a technology leader, and how personally interested I was in the project.\n\nFor example, if you are having problems with missing inventory, you could implement a better system for tracking the most critical inventory, perhaps integrated with internet connected scales/computer vision/whatever other systems you have for estimating counts and visualizing internal logistics. I would propose this fundamentally be a data warehouse, dbt sql transforms, and metabase, with a cloud function for collecting input data from sensors, but do whatever works.\n\nI would then just build it, prove it works, and get the company to use it. Don't try to get paid for it first. Just build it and make it work really well. Do that a couple times, and start leaning on leverage from the company depending on you for more things, only after they are indeed dependent on you, to change at least your title, if not your entire role. Ideally, hire an experienced software engineer or two, empower them with the leverage you built up, while you humbly learn from them, as a kind of servant leader.\n\nNow, you have the leverage of the labor market at the \\*leadership\\* level, which is a way better place to be, not the junior level which is a shit show. Maybe that leverage leads you to running technology teams at that company, or maybe you actually exercise it to join somewhere else. Regardless, that is \\*exactly\\* the kind of story that sells people into tech leadership roles, not a CS degree.\n\nThis is more or less what everyone I know who is outlier successful in tech did. Ignore the concept of job titles and norms around career pathways, focus on creating value, use that value to create leverage, use that leverage to both empower yourself to create more value and capture value, after there is a lot of value.\n\nAlmost no one on this sub will understand this because most are like 23, have no established leverage in a business with which they could do this, nor time to have done it, nor connections with leadership to have understood how things get done at that level.\n\nThe other pro is that it's no longer either/or. You are hedged the whole time by keeping your current job.\n\nThe core insight is that hiring managers are just looking for evidence that you can deliver requirements in their business. There is no stronger evidence than having already done that at a business. A 22 year old can't convince an established business to work with them to make that evidence with them. You probably can.",

You'd be shocked at the amount of JS devs who dont understand the call stack and event loop or don't know if js is a dynamically or statically typed language LOL\n2. Get good at DSA. Identity patterns and solve 2-3 mediums and 1 hard leetcode a week\n3. Get good at architecture. Buy the Alex Xu book and do some mock interviews. Maybe set up a server at home with redis since you're primary a front end. Cloud certs are just an extension of this. The AWS solutions architect exam is literally 65ish system design questions with an Amazon flair. \n4. Get good at soft skills. I recommend \"Grow: the essential guide to get promoted\". It's a 2 hour read and has been Invaluable to my career. Simply being active in meetings and sending follow up emails in the format of this book allowed me to lead projects early in my career \n\n1 and 4 can be done in a few months.

Completing all your work without defects or carryover while being told you're struggling is contradictory feedback that makes no sense. Your tech lead sounds unprofessional and possibly threatened by having to mentor someone, which is literally part of senior roles.\n\nThe fact that you study outside work, use proper question etiquette, take notes, and have certifications shows you're doing everything right. Good developers ask questions, especially early in their careers. A healthy team would encourage this, not punish it. The \"vibes-based\" performance reviews are particularly concerning red flags.\n\nDon't let one dysfunctional workplace convince you to abandon an entire career. Most tech teams aren't like this, and your methodical approach suggests you actually have good instincts for the field. Your current situation is damaging your confidence unnecessarily, and the longer you stay, the harder it becomes to remember that this isn't normal or acceptable.\n\nStart job searching immediately while you still have income. A service like Applyre might be helpful. When interviewing, ask about mentorship programs, team dynamics, and how they support junior developers. Good companies will have structured onboarding and patient senior developers.",

Personally I have a million interests and side projects and hobbies and things I want to learn (both in and out of software) so it really isn't hard for me to answer this question with confidence, but obviously that depends, again, on you. Nobody can answer the question for you and there's not one magical answer.\n\n\"Judging you for something that isn't your fault\" is what the world is made of brother. I'm not sure what you think a hiring process is but it is very much people looking for reasons not to hire people. You need to give them strong signals that you're worth hiring that override those negative signals. A 6 month - 1 year gap is easily overcomeable if you look like you have stayed engaged with software development, have a portfolio, interview well, etc.\n\nDefinitely do NOT say \"I've essentially been unengaged\"",

Guess where their loyalty is going to be?\n* Their job is to do an initial screening based on JD and hand over the candidate for interviews. In most cases, JD's are too generic and weak, hence they end up screening candidates without the right profile.\n* Recruiters aren't tecnical. Don't expect them to explain the JD or job with you or give you tactical advice - other than basic fluff about the company you can get on Reddit or their website\n\nPro tip: Learn to read JD and tailor your resume with the keywords mentioned (if you really have the experience).

Most companies today are shipping products faster via LLM APIs, so roles that once demanded model training and debugging have been flattened into integration-heavy workflows. That said, the deeper work still exists just in more focused places: research teams, model pre-training groups, infra/startup labs, or proprietary AI stack builders.\n\nIf you’re not seeing these roles on portals, it’s likely because they’re less advertised and more network-driven. You’re not burnt out you’re underutilized. Consider targeting orgs building from scratch (e.g., open-source foundation models, RLHF stacks, or custom embedding workflows) where your skill set is still a competitive advantage.

I got thrown under the bus 1 year later, ending up getting PIPed without any help.  I ended up learning nothing from that job (working inside a siloed facility without internet access nor work peers).\n\nAdded the 1 YoE to my resume and returned to my job search.  Got a job offer a week ago (2025).\n\nThe first job gave an offer the day after a brief interview.  I think they asked to identify a string palindrome and what polymorphism was.\n\nThe second job gave a job offer 2 months after the initial interview (I had assumed they had rejected me by then).  I had a gauntlet of 5 smaller technical interviews total.  They asked stuff like pass by reference, stack vs heap, multi-threading, setting bits, virtual tables, and other C topics.  I definitely badly bombed the very last one.\n\nI had lost hope in my future somewhere around 2024 (4 years of unemployment vs 1 year of employment is harsh), any job applications since then were just denial.  \"Everyone's better than me\",  \"I'll be homeless\", etc.  The app that led to an offer was ironically one I was NOT QUALIFIED for.  \"Oh, you want an X?  I'll give you an X!  I'll apply anyway you snobby-!\"\n\nThat company admitted to having frozen hiring at most of their teams, with the position I applied to being an exception.  I highly encourage people who feel lost to apply to jobs they are unqualified for (worked for me).\n\nI wish you luck in getting a job ASAP.",

You can also use Python for back-end like you would with C# or Java or JavaScript/Node.js. \n\nBut for front-end web development, JavaScript is pretty much an essential requirement, there's no way around JS for front-end web dev (there is TypeScript, but TypeScript is just JS with static typing and additional features, and you need to know JavaScript in order to know TypeScript, but since it includes static typing, your knowledge of C# will make it easier to learn TypeScript, but you must have JavaScript fundamentals down beforehand!)",

Many of those people left or were purged in waves of performance-based layoffs.\n\nI personally think that the work culture has improved but of course it depends on the team and manager.

When you work for a company like that, you're basically signing up for onboarding yourself in 6 months, and committed to staying out of the bottom 5-10% of the team.\n\nAt larger companies, there's opportunity to really go beyond your role, the performance review process is standardized, and when you submit a a promo packet, you'll get a response. I don't think it's that bad, but I also stepped up as a Senior to be in a team lead role, so that's a sort built in \"exceeds expectations\" as long as we deliver impact every perf period. It's fine to be motivated by money, I check stock price all the time, but the challenging nature of the work means folks that are passionate really hold an advantage.\n\nAs far as concern over getting PIP'd. I've found that the people on the PIP shortlist are the same ones that are more motivated by money than actually becoming better software engineers. In a workplace like a large company with stack ranking, you're not only competing against smart people, but smart people who are highly motivated and ambitious to move ahead.",

How can we facilitate this so it works for both of us?\n\nOn the mentor side, I’ve been working for a little over 5 years now, and I’ve always liked asking a lot of questions to my mentees to figure out how they would like to be supported, and then go from there to see what I can do to help them. This can come as direct advice from my side, sponsoring them to pick up or lead projects that can help them reach their goals, or putting them in touch with other folks within the team or company that could help them better than I can!
