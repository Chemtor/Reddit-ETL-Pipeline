        "author": "MikeDoesEverything",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In contrast to the vast number of posts which are basically either:\n\n* Announcing they are quitting\n* Complaining they can't get a job\n* Complaining they can't do their current job\n* \"I heard DE is dead.  Source: me.  Zero years experience in DE or any job for that matter. 25 years experience in TikTok.  I am 21 years old\"\n* Needing projects\n* Begging for \"tips\" how to pass the forbidden word which rhymes with schminterview (this one always gets a chuckle)\n* Also begging for \"tips\" on how to do their job (I put tips in inverted commas because what they want is a full blown solution to something they can't do)\n* AI generated posts (whilst I largely think the mods do a great job, the number of blatant AI posts in here is painful to read)\n\nI thought a nice change of pace was required.  So here it is - I'm a DE who is happy and is actually writing this post using my own brain.\n\nAbout me: I am self taught and have been a DE for just under 5 years ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/lmi2lg/from_a_beginner_to_beginners_from_printhello/)).  Spend most of my time doing quite interesting (to me) work where I have a data focussed, technical role building a data platform.  I earn a decent amount of money with which I'm happy with.\n\nMy work conditions are decent with an understanding and supportive manager.  Have to work weekends? Here's some very generous overtime.  Requested time off? No problem - go and enjoy your holiday and see you when you back with no questions asked.  They treat me like a person, I turn up every day and put in the extra work when they need me to.  Don't get me wrong, I'm the most cynical person ever although my last two managers have changed my mind completely.\n\nI dictate my own workload and have loads of freedom.  If something needs fixing, I will go ahead and fix it.  Opinions during technical discussions are always considered and rarely swatted away.  I get a lot of self satisfaction from turning out work and am a healthy mix of proud (when something is well built and works) and not so proud (something which really shouldn't exist but has to).  My job security is higher than most because I don't work in the US or in a high risk industry which means slightly less money although a lot less stress.\n\nRegularly get approached for new opportunities of both contract and FTE although have no plans on leaving any time soon because I like my current everything.  Yes, more money would be nice although the amount of \"arsehole pay\" I would need to cope working with, well, potential arseholes is quite high at the moment.\n\nBefore I get asked any predictable questions, some observations:\n\n* Most, if not all, people who have worked in IT and have never done another job are genuinely spoilt.  Much higher salaries, flexibility, and number of opportunities than most fields along with a lower barrier to entry, infinite learning resources, and possibility of building whatever you want from home with almost no restrictions.  My previous job required 4 years of education to get an actual entry level position, which is on-site only, and I was extremely lucky to have not needed a PhD. I got my first job in DE with £40-60 of courses and a used, crusty Dell Optiplex from Ebay.  The \"bad job market\" everybody is experiencing is probably better than most jobs best job market.\n* If you are using AI to fucking write REDDIT POSTS then you don't have imposter syndrome because you're a literal imposter.  If you don't even have the confidence to use your own words on a social media platform, then you should use this as an opportunity because arranging your thoughts or developing your communication style is something you clearly need practice with.  AI is making you worse to the point you are literally deferring what words you want to use to a computer.  Let that sink in for a sec how idiotic this is.  Yes, I am shaming you.\n* If you can't get a job and are instead reading this post, then seriously get off the internet and stick some time into getting better.  You don't need more courses.  You don't need guidance.  You don't need a fucking mentor.  You need discipline, motivation, and drive.  Real talk: if you find yourself giving up there are two choices.  You either take a break and find it within you to keep going or you can just do something else.\n* If you want to keep going: then keep going.  Somebody doing 10 hours a week and are \"talented\" will get outworked by the person doing 60+ hours a week who is \"average\". Time in the seat is a very important thing and there are no shortcuts for time spent learning.  The more time you spend learning new things and improving, the quicker you'll reach your goal.  What might take somebody 12 months might take you 6.  What might take you 6 somebody might learn in 3.  Ignore everybody else's journey and focus on yours.\n* If you want to stop: there's no shame in realising DE isn't for you.  There's no shame in realising ANY career isn't for you.  We're all good at something, friends.  Life doesn't always have to be a struggle.\n\nAMA\n\nEDIT: Jesus, already seeing AI replies.  If I suspect you are replying with an AI, you're giving me the permission to roast the fuck out of you.",

        "author": "Fonduemeup",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**After working as a DA for 1 year, DS/MLE for 3 years, and DE for 4, my outlook on this field (and life in general, sadly) has never been bleaker.** \n\nEvery position I've been in has had its own frustrations in some way: team is overworked, too much red tape, lack of leadership, lack of organization/strategy, hostile stakeholders, etc...And just recently, **management laid off some of our team because they \"think we should be able to use AI to be more productive\".** \n\nI feel like I have been searching for that mystical \"dream job\" for years, and yet it seems that I am further away from obtaining it as ever before. With AI having already made so much progress, I'm starting to think that this dream job I have been looking for may no longer even exist. \n\nEven though I've enjoyed my job at times in the past, **at this point, I think I'm done with this career.** \n\nI have lost all the passion that I originally had 8 years ago, and I don't foresee it ever returning. What will I do next? Who knows. I have a few months of savings that will keep me afloat before I figure that out, and if money starts running out, my backup plan is to become a surf instructor in Fiji (or something along those lines).   \n\n\n\nBefore the layoffs, my team was already using AI, and, while it's been increasingly useful, the tech is no where near the point of replacing multiple tenured engineers, at least in our situation. \n\nWe've been pretty good on staying up-to-date with AI trends - we hopped on Cursor back in February and have been using Claude Code since April. However, our codebase is way too convoluted for consistent results, and we lack proper documentation for AI agents to implement major changes. After several failed attempts to solve these issues, I find Claude Code only useful for small, localized features or fixes. Until LLMs can extrapolate code to understand the underlying business context, or write code that is fully aware of end-to-end system dependencies, my team will continue to face these problems. \n\n**My favorite part about working in data has always been when I get to solve challenging problems through code, but this has completely disappeared from my day-to-day work**. Writing complex logic is a fun challenge, and it's very rewarding when you finally build a working solution. Unfortunately, this is one of the few things AI is much more efficient than me at doing, so I barely do it anymore. Instead, I'm basically supervising a junior engineer (Claude) that does the work while I handle the administrative / PM duties. Meanwhile, I'm even more busy than before since we are all picking up the extra workload from our teammates that were let go. \n\nAs AI capabilities continue to improve, this part of my job will surely become a larger amount of my time, and I simply can't see myself doing it any more than I already am. I had a short stint as a manager a couple years ago, and while it wasn't for me, it was at least rewarding to help actual people. Instructing a LLM was interesting and fun at first, but the novelty wore off several months ago, and I now find it to be irritating above anything else. \n\nMost of my experience comes from startups and mid-sized companies, but it really hit me yesterday when talking to my friend who is a DS at a FAANG. She has been dealing with her own frustrations at work, and although her situation is very different than mine, she voiced the same negative sentiments that I had been feeling. I am now thinking that my feelings are more widespread than I thought. Or maybe I have just had bad luck. ",

        "title": "The Anatomy of a S3-Native Distributed Query Engine",
        "author": "heisenberg_zzh",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering,\n\nI'm the co-founder of Databend, an open source Snowflake alternative, and I wanted to share a bit of our journey building a SQL query engine that's designed to live on cloud storage like S3. This isn't a sales pitch—just an honest, educational walkthrough of the \"why\" behind our architecture. If you've ever been curious about what happens inside a query engine or why your queries on data lakes sometimes feel slow, I hope this sheds some light.\n\n**The Dream: A Database on S3**\n\nLike many of you, we love S3. It's cheap, it's huge, and it's durable. The dream is to just point a SQL engine at it and go, without managing a complex, traditional data warehouse. But there's a catch: S3 is a network service, and the network is *slow*.\n\nA single data request to S3 might take 50-200 milliseconds. In that tiny slice of time, your CPU could have executed millions of instructions. If your query engine just sits there and waits for the data to arrive, you're essentially paying for expensive CPUs to do nothing. This latency is the single biggest monster you have to slay when building a database on S3.\n\n**Why We Built a New Query Executor**\n\nWhen we started, we naturally looked at classic database designs. They're brilliant pieces of engineering, but they were born in a world of fast, local disks.\n\n1. **The \"Pull\" Model (aka the \"Volcano\" model):** Think of this like a game of telephone. The final step of your query plan (e.g., `SUM()`) asks the step before it for a row, which asks the step before it, and so on, all the way down to the data source. It's simple and has a nice, natural flow. **But on S3, it's a performance disaster.** When the first operator in the chain asks S3 for data, the *entire assembly line* of operators grinds to a halt. Your CPUs are idle, just waiting for data to arrive, while you're burning money on compute you can't use.\n2. **The \"Push\" Model (Vectorized Execution):** This is more like a factory assembly line. The data source pushes batches of data to the first worker, which processes it and pushes it to the next. It's fantastic for raw CPU performance. **But on S3, it's a memory bomb.** S3 can send data in unpredictable bursts. A fast data-scanning step can easily flood a slower step (like a complex `JOIN`), causing data to pile up in memory until the system crashes.\n\n**From SQL to an Execution Plan**\n\nSo, how does a simple SQL string like `SELECT * FROM ...` turn into a plan that our workers can run? It's a multi-stage process, a bit like a chef turning a recipe into a detailed kitchen workflow.\n\n1. **Parsing:** First, we parse the raw SQL text into a structured format called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This is just a tree that represents the query's grammar, making it understandable for the machine.\n2. **Logical Plan:** Next, we convert the AST into a *logical plan*. This describes the *what* of the query—the sequence of high-level operations needed, like \"scan this table,\" then \"filter these rows,\" then \"aggregate the results.\" It's still abstract and doesn't care about how the data is stored or how many machines we have.\n3. **Physical Plan:** This is where the magic happens. Our query optimizer takes the logical plan and transforms it into a *physical plan*. It looks at table statistics, data layout, and available resources to decide the most efficient *how*. For example, it decides whether to use a Hash Join or a Merge Join, how to distribute work across nodes, and in what order to join tables.\n4. **Executor Graph:** Finally, this physical plan is used to generate the actual graph of `Processor` actors that our scheduler will run. Each step in the physical plan becomes one or more workers in our asynchronous assembly line.\n\nThis whole process ensures that by the time we start executing, we have a cost-optimized, concrete plan ready to go.\n\n**A New Plan: Building for the Cloud**\n\nThe core idea was simple: **a worker should never block waiting for the network.** While it's waiting for S3, it should be able to do other useful work. This is the principle of asynchronous processing.\n\nWe designed a system in Rust based on a few key concepts:\n\n* **Workers as Independent \"Actors\":** Each part of the query plan—a `Filter`, `Join`, `Aggregate`—is an independent worker. Think of it as a specialist on an assembly line with a simple job and its own state.\n* **A Central \"Scheduler\" as the Factory Manager:** Instead of talking to each other, workers report their status to a central scheduler. A worker can raise its hand and say:\n   * \"I'm ready for data!\"\n   * \"I have a batch of data and I'm ready to do some computation.\"\n   * \"I'm about to ask S3 for data, which will take a while. You can check back on me later.\"\n   * \"Whoa, I'm getting overwhelmed! My output buffer is full! Tell the upstream workers to pause.\"\n* **Backpressure as the Safety Valve:** That last status is crucial. It's called **backpressure**, and it's the system's safety valve. It prevents the memory bomb. If a `JOIN` worker gets overwhelmed, it tells the scheduler, which then tells the `Scan` worker to stop fetching data from S3 for a moment. This allows the system to self-regulate and remain stable.\n* **IO Concurrency is Key to Hiding Latency:** Because asking for data is non-blocking, we can ask S3 for hundreds of different data chunks *all at once*. The scheduler then efficiently processes them as they arrive. This allows us to saturate the network connection and hide the latency of any single request, dramatically improving throughput.\n\n**How This Scales to Handle Complex SQL**\n\nThis architecture allows us to scale in two ways:\n\n1. **Multi-threading (Scaling Up):** For a single, large query, we can duplicate parts of the query pipeline. For example, we can have multiple `Scan` and `Partial Aggregate` workers running in parallel on different CPU cores, each processing a different part of the data. A final `Merge` step combines their results.\n2. **Distributed Execution (Scaling Out):** To scale across multiple machines, we treat the network as just another connection between workers. A special `Exchange` worker on one machine can send data to another `Exchange` worker on a different machine. To the rest of the query plan, it's completely transparent. This lets us use the same logic for a single-node query and a 100-node distributed query.\n\n**A Few Hard-Won Lessons**\n\n* **Stability over raw speed:** Building in robust backpressure from day one was the single most important decision for system stability.\n* **Separate your concerns:** We run I/O-heavy tasks (like waiting for the network) and CPU-heavy tasks (like decompressing data) on separate thread pools. This ensures that a long computation doesn't stop the engine from handling new data arriving from S3.\n* **Observability is everything:** When you have thousands of tiny tasks running in parallel, you need great tooling to see what's going on, like query profiles, flamegraphs, and distributed tracing logs to find where the bottlenecks are and why a query is slow.\n\nI hope this was a helpful, non-hyped look into what it takes to build a modern, cloud-native query engine. The concepts of asynchronous processing and backpressure are becoming more and more relevant for all kinds of data systems, not just databases.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions about our architecture or the trade-offs we made!

        "author": "OkSatisfaction7486",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, sorry if my English isn’t very good.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nI’m a fresh graduate in Actuarial Science. Got a Jr. Data Engineer role, but the Senior DE quit right before I joined now I’m the only DE. Everything is a mess (broken pipelines, legacy code, poor management, no guidance, layoffs). On top of that, they expect huge changes, endless requirements, and bad deadlines, with constant meetings leaving no time to work. I’m learning a lot, but I’m burned out and doubting if I should stay or return to actuarial work.\n\nI just graduated in May with a degree in Actuarial Science. And over here it’s common to have an internship while still studying during the semester, so almost everyone graduates with around two years of experience. During my internships, I worked on pension and macroeconomics analysis. Later, I had the opportunity to join a BI team at a fintech. There, I helped improve semantic models, fix dashboards with slow refresh times, and implement better practices. After that, I got another internship offer for the Data Engineering team, which was basically a one person team. I decided to give it a shot, and it turned out to be a good experience: I used Azure for the first time, learned some Scala, Airflow, and PySpark.\n\nFast forward to one month before graduation: an international manufacturer contacted me for a Jr DE position. I doubted if I could fit in, since my technical skills weren’t as strong as CS graduates. After three interviews (one with the Senior DE, where we had an amazing conversation), I got the job offer. I was skeptical, but I accepted it because the Senior DE convinced me it was a great opportunity. I even turned down another offer from an insurance company.\n\nTo my surprise, during onboarding they told me the Senior DE had just quit the Friday before, leaving me as the only DE. After some thought, I accepted. But I wasn’t ready for what I found:\n\n* No documentation\n* Broken pipelines\n* Tons of legacy code from outsourcing during the pandemic\n* Broken dashboards and angry users\n* A messy data lake with no organization\n* A passive-aggressive data steward whenever I try to improve workflows\n* A team using Scrum (my first time) with POs who don’t know what they need\n* A project manager who flames us whenever something goes wrong\n* A “data scientist” who is really used as an analytics engineer\n\nRight now, I’m doing my best: learning best practices, writing documentation, and even working extra hours. But it feels like I’m always just fixing problems. There’s one dashboard that breaks almost every day, pipelines that constantly need re-runs, and new business rules popping up all the time. On top of that, leadership keeps pushing for “big changes” with impossible deadlines, constant requirements, and back-to-back meetings that leave me with almost no time to actually focus on building things.\n\nAfter a 1:1 with my manager, he admitted the company’s vision changes almost daily. The CTO once told me about the importance of building a data driven mindset, but just three days later, layoffs happened and the CTO himself was gone. Now I have no guidance, I don’t know where we’re heading, and I’m doubting my skills.\n\n**What would you do in my position? Should I quit and go back to the actuarial path?**",

When the going gets real hard I go get another job, I have climbed up to a senior role now. Fortunately this employment history of two years per organization seems to be acceptable.\n\nProblem is I am here again. Have been interviewing for roles and trying to get excited again about new projects. Interviewing for some lead roles and already have an offer to lead migration from DBT to a streaming setup. But I wonder if I'm setting myself up for failure. I do enjoy technical challenges but I do sort of feel like I am only using one side of my brain as a data engineer.\n\nAm I just burnt out and maybe need a break? I feel like even with a break the same thing would eventually come back. I don't currently have a stressful job, for example I work about 30 hours a week maybe I need to find value from other parts of life.\n\nI am also looking at going back to school for a master's to pick up some skills that would allow me to maybe work on more interesting projects (don't have the CS or engineering undergrad background, would maybe be cool to explore other technical subjects) Not thinking I'd suddenly become a game developer but I love to tinker and maybe having more fundamentals would allow me to get a personal project off the ground to the point where that could be a full-time job. I would love to have more product-focused SWE skills versus just being able to migrate DBT models to Databricks. But the downside is becoming a poor student again when I already have a career, maybe just not the one I want.\n\nAnyone who has done DE type work for longer able to comment? Are these types of low points normal, or a hint I should try to continue to find something else?",

Recent data isn’t more valuable than historical data - e.g., financial data where accuracy matters more than freshness.\n3.

This solution uses a custom Single Message Transform (SMT) to emit OpenLineage events, allowing you to visualize your entire pipeline—from source connectors to Kafka topics and out to sinks like S3 and Apache Iceberg—all within Marquez.\n\nIt's a \"pass-through\" SMT, so it doesn't touch your data, but it hooks into the `RUNNING`, `COMPLETE`, and `FAIL` states to give you a complete picture in Marquez.\n\n**What it does:**\n- **Automatic Lifecycle Tracking:** Capturing `RUNNING`, `COMPLETE`, and `FAIL` states for your connectors.\n- **Rich Schema Discovery:** Integrating with the Confluent Schema Registry to capture column-level lineage for Avro records.\n- **Consistent Naming & Namespacing:** Ensuring your Kafka, S3, and Iceberg datasets are correctly identified and linked across systems.\n\nI'd love for you to check it out and give some feedback. The source code for the SMT is in the repo if you want to see how it works under the hood.\n\n**You can run the full demo environment here:**\nFactor House Local - https://github.com/factorhouse/factorhouse-local\n\n**And the full guide + source code is here:**\nKafka Connect Lineage Guide - https://github.com/factorhouse/examples/blob/main/projects/data-lineage-labs/lab1_kafka-connect.md\n\nThis is the first piece of a larger project, so stay tuned—I'm working on an end-to-end demo that will extend this lineage from Kafka into Flink and Spark next.\n\nCheers!\n",

Note that I did suggest a threshold or margin to flag discrepancies but they refused. The sourced data is incorrect to begin with because of inconsistent data values and now thats being used to validate the pipeline.\n\nThat doesn’t seem right to me, since the whole purpose of cleaning is to fix inconsistencies and remove bad data — so the totals will naturally differ by some margin.\nIs this a common practice, or is there a better way I can frame the validation I’ve already done to show it’s solid.

        "author": "peterxsyd",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# Dear Data Engineers,\n\nI’ve recently built a production-grade, from-scratch implementation of the ***Apache Arrow*** data standard in **Rust**—shaped to to strike a new balance between ***simplicity***, ***power***, and ***ergonomics***.\n\nI’d love to share it with you and get your thoughts, particularly if you:\n\n* Work in the *(more hardcore end) of the* **data engineering** space\n* Us**e Rust for data pipeline**s, or the Arrow data format for systems / engine / embedded work\n* Build **distributed** or **embedded** software that benefits from Arrow’s memory layout and wire protocols just as much as the columnar analytics it's typically known for.\n\n# Why did I build it?\n\n***Apache Arrow*** (and `arrow-rs`) are very powerful and have reshaped the data ecosystem through zero-copy memory sharing, lean buffer specs, and a rich interoperability story. When building certain types of high-performance data systems in Rust, though (e.g., distributed data, embedded), I found myself running into friction.\n\n# Pain points:\n\n* **Engineering Velocity:** The general-purpose design is great for the ecosystem, but I encountered long compile times *(30+ seconds).*\n* **Heavy Abstraction:** Deep trait layers and hierarchies made some otherwise simple tasks more involved—like printing a buffer or quickly seeing types in the IDE.\n* **Type Landscape:** Many logical Arrow types share the same physical representation. Completeness is important, but in my work I’ve valued a clearer, more consolidated type model. In shaping Minarrow, I leaned on the principle often attributed to Einstein: *“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler\".* This ethos has filtered through the conventions used in the library.\n* **Composability:** I often wanted to “opt up” and down abstraction levels depending on the situation—e.g. from a raw buffer to an Arrow Array—without friction.\n\nSo I set out to build something tuned for engineering workloads that plugs naturally into everyday Rust use cases without getting in the way. The result is an Arrow-*Compatible* implementation from the ground up.\n\n# Introducing: Minarrow\n\nArrow minimalism meets Rust polyglot data systems engineering.\n\n# Highlights:\n\n* Custom `Vec64` allocator: 64-byte aligned, SIMD-compatible. No setup required. Benchmarks indicate alloc parity with standard `Vec`.\n* Six base types (`IntegerArray<T>`, `FloatArray<T>`, `CategoricalArray<T>`, `StringArray<T>`, `BooleanArray<T>`, `DatetimeArray<T>`), slotting into many modern use cases (HFC, embedded work, streaming ) etc.\n* Arrow-compatible, with some simplifications:\n   * Logical Arrow types collapsed via generics (e.g. DATE32, DATE64 → `DatetimeArray<T>`).\n   * Dictionary encoding represented as `CategoricalArray<T>`.\n* Unified, ergonomic accessors: `myarr.num().i64()` with IDE support, no downcasting.\n* Arrow Schema support, chunked data, zero-copy views, schema metadata included.\n* Zero dependencies beyond `num-traits` *(and optional Rayon).*\n\n# Performance and ergonomics\n\n* **1.5s clean build,** <**0.15s rebuilds**\n* **Very fast runtime** *(See laptop benchmarks in repo)*\n* **Tokio-native IPC:** async IPC Table and Parquet readers/writers via sibling crate *Lightstream*\n* **Zero-copy MMAP r**eader *(\\~100m row reads in \\~4ms on my consumer laptop)*\n* **Automatic 64-byte alignment** *(avoiding SIMD penalties and runtime checks)*\n* `.to_polars()` and `.to_arrow()` built-in\n* Rayon parallelism\n* **Full FFI** via Arrow C Data Interface\n* **Extensive documentation**\n\n# Trade-offs:\n\n* **No nested types** *(List, Struct)* or other exotic Arrow types at this stage\n* **Full connector ecosystem** requires \\`.to\\_arrow()\\` bridge to Apache Arrow *(compile-time cost: 30–60s)* . *Note: IPC and Parquet are directly supported in Lightstream.*\n\n# Outcome:\n\n* **Fast, lean, and clean** – rapid iteration velocity\n* **Compatible**: Uses Arrow memory layout and ecosystem-pluggable\n* **Composable**: use only what’s necessary\n* **Performance** **without penalty** (compile times! Obviously Arrow itself is an *outstanding ecosystem*).\n\n# Where Minarrow fits:\n\n* **Ultra-performance data pipelines**\n* **Embedded system and** **polyglot** **apps**\n* **SIMD compute**\n* **Live streaming**\n* **HPC** and low-latency workloads\n* MIT Licensed\n\n# Open-Source sister-crates:\n\n* **Lightstream**: Native streaming with Tokio, for building custom wire formats and minimising memory copies. Includes SIMD-friendly async readers and writers, enabling direct SIMD-accelerated processing from a memory-mapped file.\n* **Simd-Kernels**: 100+ SIMD and standard kernels for statistical analysis, string processing, and more, with an extensive set of univariate distributions.\n* You can find these on crates-io or my GitHub.\n\nRust is still developing in the Data Engineering ecosystem, but if your work touches high-performance data pipelines, Arrow interoperability, or low-latency data systems, hopefully this will resonate.\n\nWould love your feedback.\n\nThanks,\n\nPB\n\n  \n**Github**: [https://github.com/pbower/minarrow](https://github.com/pbower/minarrow)",

Here’s what worked (and what didn’t):\n\n**1. Data ingestion**\n- Mix of **official APIs**, **custom scrapers**, and **file uploads (Excel/CSV)**.\n- APIs are great… until rate limits kick in.\n- Scrapers constantly broke due to DOM changes, so we moved towards a modular crawler architecture.\n\n**2. Transformation & storage**\n- For small data, Pandas was fine; for large-scale, we shifted to a Spark-based ETL flow.\n- Building a schema that supports both **structured fields** and **text blobs** was trickier than expected.\n- We store intermediate results to S3, then feed them into a Postgres + Elasticsearch hybrid.\n\n**3. Analysis & reporting**\n- Downstream consumers wanted dashboards and visualizations, so we auto-generate reports from aggregated metrics.\n- For trend detection, we rely on a mix of TF-IDF, sentiment scoring, and lightweight ML models.\n\nKey takeaways:\n- **Schema evolution** is the silent killer — plan for breaking changes early.\n- Invest in **pipeline observability** (we use OpenTelemetry) to debug failures faster.\n- Scaling ETL isn’t about size, it’s about **variance** — the more sources, the messier it gets.\n\nCurious if anyone here has tackled **multi-platform ETL** before:\n- Do you centralize all raw data first, or process at the edge?\n- How do you manage scraper reliability at scale?\n- Any tips on schema evolution when source structures are constantly changing?\n",

The issue is this is still a lot of data, and sometimes these query engines are still slow (couple seconds per query), which is annoying from a user standpoint when using a dashboard.\n\nI'm wondering if it makes sense to pre-aggregate all OLAP combinations but in a more key-value oriented way, and then use Postgres hstore or Cassandra or something to just do single-record lookups.

Thus, I'm working on a PoC migration strategy (Important note: the management is already convinced that migration is probably a good idea - so this is more a discussion on strategy).\n\n  \nMy current plan is to migrate a few of our staging postgres/mysql datatables to s3 as parquet files (using aws dms), and then copy those into Snowflake. Given that I'm the only data engineer atm, I choose Snowflake due to my familiarity with it and due to its simplicity (also the reason I'm not thinking on dealing with Iceberg in external stages and decided to go for Snowflake native format)\n\nMy comments / questions are  \n\\- Any pitfalls that I should be aware when performing a data migration via AWS DMS?  \n\\- Our postgres/mysql datatabases are actually being updated constantly via en event-driven architecture. How much of a problem can that be for the migration process? (The updating is not necessarily only append-operations, but often older rows are modified)  \n\\- Given the point above: does it make much of a difference to use provided instances or serverless for DMS?  \n\\- General advice on how to organize my parquet files system for bullet-proofing for full-scale migration in the future? (Or should I not think about it atm?)  \n\n\nAny insights or comments from similar experiences are welcomed :)\n\n  \n",

I needed vector search with sophisticated metadata filtering, but existing solutions were either,\n\n-Too bloated (full vector databases when I needed something minimal for analysis)\n-Limited in filtering capabilities\n-Had unintuitive APIs that I was not happy about.\n\nI wanted something minimal, fast, and with an API that feels natural - inspired by Polars, which I absolutely love.\n\nWhat Makes Otters Different\n\nExact Search: Perfect for small-to-medium datasets (up to ~10M vectors) where accuracy matters more than massive scale.\n\nPerformance: \n-SIMD-accelerated scoring\n-Zonemaps and Bloom filters for intelligent chunk pruning\n\nPolars-Inspired API: Write filters as simple expressions\n```\nmeta_store.query(query_vec, Metric::Cosine)\n    .meta_filter(col(\"price\").lt(100) & col(\"category\").eq(\"books\"))\n    .vec_filter(0.8, Cmp::Gt)\n    .take(10)\n    .collect()\n```\n\nThe library is in very early stages and there are tons of features that i want to add\nPython bindings, NumPy support\nSerialization and persistence\nParquet / Arrow integration\nVector quantization\netc.\n\nI'm primarily a Python/JAX/PyTorch developer, so diving into rust programming has been an incredible learning experience.\n\nIf you think this is interesting and worth your time, please give it a try.\nI welcome contributions and feedback !\n\nhttps://crates.io/crates/otters-rs\nhttps://github.com/AtharvBhat/otters",

The goal is to process retail sales data (invoices, customers, products) and make it ready for analysis.\n\nHere is what the project does:\n\n* **ETL and analysis:** Extract, transform, and analyze retail data using **pandas**. We also perform **data quality checks** in MySQL to ensure the data is clean and correct.\n* **Pipeline orchestration:** Airflow runs DAGs to automate the workflow.\n* **XCom storage:** Large pandas DataFrames are stored in **MinIO**. Airflow only keeps references, which makes it easier to pass data between tasks.\n* **Database:** MySQL stores metadata and results. It can run init scripts automatically to create tables or seed data.\n* **Metabase :** Used for simple visualization.\n\nYou can check the full project on GitHub:  \n[https://rafo044.github.io/Retailflow/](https://rafo044.github.io/Retailflow/)  \n[https://github.com/Rafo044/Retailflow](https://github.com/Rafo044/Retailflow)\n\nI built this project to explore Airflow, using object storage for XCom, and building ETL pipelines for retail data.\n\nIf you are new to this field like me, I would be happy to work together and share experience while building projects.\n\nI would also like to hear your thoughts.

This is basically an e-commerce store from where users can rent DVDs of their favorite movies and tv shows.  \nThink of it like a real-world product that we are developing.  \n\\- It will have a frontend  \n\\- It will have a backend  \n\\- It will have databases  \n\\- It will have data warehouses for analytics  \n\\- It will have admin dashboard for data visualization  \n\\- It will have microservices like ML, Notification services, user behavior tracking  \n  \nEach component of this product will be a project in itself, this will help us in learning and implementing solutions in context of a real world product hence we will be able to understand all the things that are missed while learning new technologies.  We will also get an understanding the development journey of any real world project and we will be able to create projects with professionalism.\n\nThe first component of this project is complete and I want to share this with you all.\n\nThe most important component of this project is the Data. The data component is divided into 2 parts:-  \n**Content Metadata** and **Transactional Data.** The content data is the metadata of the movies and tv shows which will be rendered on the front end. All the data related to transactions and user navigation will be handled in the Transactional Data part.\n\nAs content data is going to be document based hence we will be use NoSQL database for this. In our case we are using **MongoDB.**   \nIn this part of the project we have created the modules which contain the methods to fetch and load the initial bulk data of movies, tv shows and credits in our MongoDB that will be rendered on the frontend. The modules are reusable, hence using this we will be automating the pipeline. I have attached the workflow image of the project yet.   \nFor more information checkout the GitHub link of the project: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Kartikrast/dvd-rental-data-pipelines)\n\nNext Steps:-\n\n\\- automating the bulk loading pipeline  \n\\- creating a pipeline to handle and updates changes[](https://github.com/Kartikrast/dvd-rental-data-pipelines)\n\nPlease fam check this out and give me your feedback or any suggestions, I would love to hear from you guys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r0uod4ajxcnf1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a85d14e118e455b63bd353d27e53b611c37439a\n\n",

        "content": "There are plenty of situations in ETL where time makes all the difference.\n\nImagine you want to ask: *“How many containers are waiting at the port right now?”*\n\nTo answer that, your pipeline can’t just rely on last night’s batch. It needs to continuously fetch updates, apply change data capture (CDC), and keep the index live.\n\nThat’s exactly the kind of foundational use case my guide covers. I’d love your brutal feedback on whether this is useful in your workflows.\n\nThe approach builds on the Pathway framework (a stream data processing engine with Python wrappers). What we’ve used here are pre-built components already deployed in production by engineering teams.\n\nOn top of that, we’ve just released the Pathway MCP Server, which makes it simple to expose your live ETL outputs and analytics to client apps and downstream services.\n\nCircling back to the example, here’s how you can set this up step by step:\n\n* Capture your data streams as Pathway tables (with CDC built in). [https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/pathway\\_mcp\\_server/](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/pathway_mcp_server/)\n* Define your transformations for aggregations, counts, or joins — they stay current as new rows flow in.\n* Expose the continuously updated tables/analytics via Pathway MCP Server, so other services can query the current state. [https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/pathway-mcp-claude-desktop/](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/pathway-mcp-claude-desktop/)\n\nPS – many teams start with our YAML templates for quick deployment, but you can always write full Python code if you need finer control.",

I’m fine keeping a local DuckDB “warehouse” and pushing to MD at the end.\n\n**What I’ve built so far**\n\n* **Python + lxml** extractors (minimal XPath, mostly `.find`/`.findtext`\\-style).\n* **Bucketing**:\n   * I split the file list into buckets (e.g., 1k–10k XMLs per bucket).\n   * Each bucket runs in its **own process** and writes to its **own local DuckDB** file.\n   * Inside a bucket, I use a **ThreadPool** to parse XMLs concurrently and **batch insert** every N files.\n* **Merge step**:\n   * After buckets finish, I **merge** all bucket DBs into a fresh, timestamped **final DuckDB**.\n   * (When I want MD, I `ATTACH` MotherDuck and do one `INSERT … SELECT` per table.)\n* **Fault tolerance**:\n   * Per-run, per-bucket outputs (separate files) let me **re-run only failed buckets** without redoing everything.\n   * I keep per-run staging dirs and a clean final DB name to avoid merging with stale data.\n\n**Current performance (local)**\n\n* On a small test: **100 XMLs** → \\~**0.46s/file** end-to-end on Windows (NVMe SSD), total \\~**49s** including merge.\n* When I pushed per-batch directly to MotherDuck earlier, it was **way slower** (network/commit overhead), hence the current **local-first, single push** design.\n\n**Constraints/notes**\n\n* Data is static on disk; I can pre-generate a file manifest and shard however I want.\n* I can increase hardware parallelism, but I’d prefer to squeeze the most out of a single beefy box before renting cluster time.\n* I’m fine changing the staging format (DuckDB ↔ Parquet) if it meaningfully improves merge/push speed or reliability.\n\nIf you’ve built similar pipelines (XML/JSON → analytics DB) I’d love to hear what worked, what didn’t, and any “wish I knew sooner” tips. I want to speed my process up and improve it, but without comprimising quality.  \n\nIn short: What are your thoughts? How would you improve this? Have you done anything like this before?\n\nThanks! 🙏",

        "content": "I’m excited to share my latest project: **PyRMap**, a lightweight R-Python bridge designed to make data exchange between R and Python faster and cleaner.\n\n*What it does:*\n\nPyRMap allows R to pass data to Python via memory-mapped files (mmap) for near-zero overhead communication. The workflow is simple:\n\n1. R writes the data to a memory-mapped binary file.\n2. Python reads the data and processes it (even running models).\n3. Results are written back to another memory-mapped file, instantly accessible by R.\n\n*Key advantages over reticulate:*\n\n* ⚡ Performance: As shown in my benchmark, for \\~1.5 GB of data, PyRMap is significantly faster than reticulate – reducing data transfer times by 40%\n\n* 🧹 Clean & maintainable code: Data is passed via shared memory, making the R and Python code more organized and decoupled (check example 8 from here - [https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap/tree/main/example/example\\_8\\_reticulate\\_comparation](https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap/tree/main/example/example_8_reticulate_comparation)). Python runs as a separate process, avoiding some of the overhead reticulate introduces.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhcpmljn1bof1.jpg?width=1270&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0b557ef319ddb8f5ae0d2f3ea2647eb1f69bfe1\n\nCurrent limitations:\n\n* Linux-only\n* Only supports running the entire Python script, not individual function calls.\n* Intermediate results in pipelines are not yet accessible.\n\nPyRMap is also part of a bigger vision: RR, a custom R interpreter written in RPython, which I hope to launch next year.\n\nCheck it out here: [https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap](https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap)\n\nWould you use a tool like this?",

I believe the advantage of Foundry is having everything ready-made, but it's also a double-edged sword since everything gets locked into the platform (besides being extremely expensive).",

        "author": "Aware_Actuator4939",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm interested in making a pivot to data engineering. Like the author of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kp2puy/am_i_too_old/), I'm in my 60s and plan to work until I'm 75 or so. Unlike that person, I have a background in technical support, IT services, and data processing. From 2007 to 2018, I worked as a data operator for a company that does data processing for financial services and health benefits businesses. I taught myself Python, Ruby, and PowerShell and used them to troubleshoot and repair problems with the data processing pipelines. From 2018 to 2023, I did email and chat tech support for Google Maps Platform APIs. \n\nLike literally millions of other people, I enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Certificate course and started researching data careers. I think that I would prefer data engineering over data science or data analytics, but from my research, I concluded that I would need a master's degree to get into data engineering, while it would be possible to get a data analytics job with a community college degree and a good data portfolio.\n\nIn 2023, I started taking classes for a computer information technology associate's degree at my local community college. \n\nEarlier this year, though, I discovered online university WGU (Western Governors University) has bachelor's and master's degrees in data analytics. The bachelor's degree has a much better focus on data analytics than my community college degrees. The WGU data analytics [master's degree](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-masters-program.html) (MSDA) has a specialization in data engineering, which reawakened my interest in the field. \n\nI've been preparing to start at WGU to earn the [bachelor's in data analytics](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-bachelors-program.html) (BSDA), then enroll in the master's degree with data engineering specialization. Last month, WGU rolled out four degree programs in [Cloud and Network Engineering](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cloud-network-engineering-bachelors-program.html) (General, AWS, Azure, and Cisco specializations). Since then, I've been trying to decide if I would be better off earning one of those degrees (instead of the BSDA) to prepare for the MSDA.\n\nSome of the courses in the **BS in Data Analytics (BSDA)**:\n\n* Data Management (using SQL) (3 courses)\n* Python programming (3 courses), R programming (1 course)\n* Data Wrangling\n* Data Visualization\n* Big Data Foundations\n* Cloud Foundations\n* Machine Learning, Machine Learning DevOps (1 course each)\n* Network and Security - Foundations (only 1 course)\n\nSome of the courses in the **BS in Cloud and Network Engineering (Azure Specialization) (BSCNE)**:\n\n* Network and Security - Foundations (same course as above)\n* Networks (CompTIA Network+)\n* Network and Security Applications (CompTIA Security+)\n* Network Analytics and Troubleshooting\n* Python for IT Automation\n* AI for IT Automation and Security\n* Cloud Platform Solutions\n* Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure and Orchestration\n* Cloud and Network Security Models\n\nBesides Network+ and Security+, I would earn CompTIA A+ and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, Azure Administrator, and Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions certifications in the BSCNE degree. The BSDA degree would give me AWS Cloud Practitioner and a couple of other certifications.\n\nIf you've gotten this far - thank you! Thank you very much! \n\nAlso, I have questions:\n\n1. Would the master's in Data Analytics (Data Engineering specialization) from **WGU** be worth it for a data engineering job seeker?\n2. If so, which WGU bachelor's degree would be better preparation for the data engineering MSDA and a later data engineering role - the bachelor's in Data Analysis, or the bachelor's in Cloud and Network Engineering (Azure or AWS)?",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just started my first ever job as a junior  dev last week (fresh out of school), and honestly it already feels like a disaster. I’m starting to question myself a bit.\n\nMy first day was Monday, and by Friday I was already in home office. Same today too and Monday too. The only office days are Wednesday and Thursday, which feels a bit sad because I’m brand new and immediately working from home with barely any guidance is to much.\n\nI never really got a proper introduction to the project, the systems, or how tickets are normally solved. My very first ticket was basically: “Yo, look in our system, I have a ticket for you, try to solve it. If you have questions, ask me…” That’s it. No walkthrough, no explanation of where to start. I asked how they usually approach tickets or where to even find the relevant code, but I still felt pretty lost.\n\nTo be fair, I did get a decent intro into the running software itself, so I kind of understand the product. But that’s where it ended. Meanwhile, I see other people who started just a month before me sitting next to their team lead getting tons of explanations and support.\n\nSomehow I managed to solve 3 tickets (a mix of with and without help), but most of the time I have nothing to do. I’m just sitting here, bored, not knowing what I should be learning or focusing on.\n\nI’ve tried to be proactive and ask what I could look into:\n\nYesterday I asked if there were patterns or frameworks I should study. The response was just: “Take a look at EF and how we make the models\" EF and setting up a config for models isnt that hard so I understood it quite fast.\n\nToday I asked again and just got sent some tickets to read through “to see if I understand what the customer wants.” which is so overwhelming.\n\nAnother coworker told me to check out their validation logic cause I will be working with this part of the project, but there are a ton of files with different rules and it’s overwhelming to dig into alone at home.\n\nSo now I’m just sitting here wondering: am I doing something wrong? Is it normal to feel this lost and useless in the first week? Or did I pick the wrong career path entirely?\n\nIt’s super frustrating because I want to learn and contribute, but right now it feels like I’m just drifting.\n\nHas anyone else been in this situation? Is this just how the start usually feels, or is this a red flag?",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "\\*EDIT: Title should be \"not a good **teacher\"**\n\n\n\nI hate to say it but ThePrimeagen is not a good teacher.\n\nI just completed boot.dev's \"Learn the HTTP Protocol in Go\" course taught by ThePrimeagen on YouTube. What I did was to first attempt the course myself, and only when I got stuck did I refer and watch the same chapter and lesson he was at on the video.\n\nIn the video, Prime is taking the entire course in one go, and he was doing it on stream, and I think that was the biggest reason his lesson was not good. He is a content creator, so when he codes, he is saying \"yayayayaya\", or \"boom boom\", and rarely ever explaning what he is doing. There are times when he does, but since this is a course, I did have the expectation he would explain what he is doing. He's basically DrDisrespect with that 'stache and mannerism if you what I mean.\n\nI would attribute this to because he was streaming it. I can tell his viewers are seasoned developers because they would comment about things and he replies. In that sense, Prime wasn't doing a course, he was just programming and talking to other developers of the same level, hence the lack of verbose explanations.\n\nSecondly, while Prime did create this course, what he does in the video is also somewhat different from the course. When programming, there are defintely different ways to do things for sure. But if I go into a lecture and the lecturer doesn't use the textbook that the lesson was built upon, I would be confused too. Especially since I attempted code myself, and only looked at his videos afterwards. Like how he would convert his functions to handle \\[\\]byte instead of string.\n\nThe reason why I'm saying is because I took 3 of Lane's course: \"Learn Go\", \"Build a Blog Aggregator in Go\" and \"Build an AI Agent in Python\". In those videos, Lane explains each line of code he is doing and why. And he also shows us what happens when he doesn't know what to do, i.e. asking Boots etc. His lessons really explains everything well and I can highly recommend courses he designs.\n\nIn Prime's word, I have a skill issue and I'm taking the L. I accept that because if I didn't have a skill issue, I wouldn't be on a learning platform at all. Now the course itself definitely taught me a lot more about HTTP protocols, but after watching 3 other courses by Lane, I was quite dissapointed by the quality of this guided project video that I had to make this post. Maybe Lane will remake this video with him guiding it but I highly doubt so, he's a busy guy and I'm looking forward to the next course he is making.",

We wont even touch on object oriented programming untill the end of this year) so i learned some stuff on my own, we are learning java in school, so i decided to get ahead and read a little about classes and objects, also learn python syntax since its simpler and i use it more often.\n\nFor my graduation thesis next year i decided to make my own 2d rocket flight simulation in python (since im also interested in rocketry) and ive already started on it, but im having trouble with knowing where to start. For example, i use numpy for some mathematical operations not present in python by default and i have no idea how people know the syntax for the functions that you need to call.\n\nBasically i want to know how do you go from i know the default stuff in python to i can find a library and immediatly figure out what it does and how to use it.",

Everything feels messy and I’m just typing stuff without really knowing why.\n\nI know OOP is super important in Java, but I have no clue how to actually *use* it to build something real. I want to go into backend dev (frontend wasn’t for me), but right now I’m low-key worried I won’t have the skills for the job market.\n\nSo yeah, my questions are:\n\n* How do you actually get good at OOP?\n* How important is OOP for backend Java devs?\n* Any tips for learning backend without losing my sanity?\n\nBasically, I don’t wanna feel like I’m just copy-pasting my way through life 😅 Any advice would be awesome.",

My thought-process is basically \"if I don't know how it ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE VISUALLY, I don't know what to do/type\". It just occurred to me that despite not being exactly a newbie-programmer, I've never really successfully solved my problems myself. The solutions I get is always from EXACTLY copying a sample source or someone else's code. You ever heard of the saying \"figure it out yourself\"? I literally cannot do that; I just don't have the mental capacity to do so. I have to copy, or I can't do anything.\n\n  \nTechnically I can understand high-level concepts to a degree, but at the end of the day I'm always going to say \"yeah.., I get it.., I understand the concept here but....., do you have a sample I can look at?\". I really think there's a certain level of hard-requirement for being proficient at any technical skill, and that is to be able to implement something by actually \"figuring it out yourself\"; for times where you just don't have access to resources like documentation or online source codes, online tutorials, etc..., and I think even till now, I just never met this IQ-requirement. You could even pass me a sample code and say \"see this section of the code? Just change it a bit....\", and I will ask you \"okay sure.., but do you have a sample of how that looks like?\"\n\nI guess I really do qualify as de-facto brainless. I don't really know what to do about that, to be honest. Does anyone have a sample on this?\n\n(Edit: No, I'm not trying to make a joke there)",

That kind of hit me, and now I really don’t want to waste any more time.\n\nI’m interested in backend development, AI/ML, and also GenAI (since it feels like everything is moving there now). The problem is I don’t know what exact skills are needed to actually be good at these fields. I see so many roadmaps and courses online that it’s overwhelming, and I can’t figure out which ones are actually worth following.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\nWhat core skills should I focus on if I want to be proficient in backend, AI/ML, and GenAI (not just toy projects)?\n\nAre there any courses/resources that genuinely take you from beginner → advanced and help you build real projects?\n\nHow do I balance DSA + backend + ML/GenAI without spreading myself too thin?\n\nWould appreciate some advice from a peer , senior or anyone currently working in this field.\n\n",

He's already done some Scratch and Roblox Studio stuff, and he's now messing around with beginner Python and Unity.\n\nAre there good online programming tutors who actually specialize in working with kids or teens? I've seen a few platforms offering online coding tutoring, but it's hard to know what's legit. Open to individual instructors or programs just want something reliable and age-appropriate.\n\nIf anyone has recommendations for online coding tutors or platforms they've used and liked, I'd really appreciate it.",

Once done, we can compare the original vs the reversed, if match we will return 'true'.  \n\n\n    const palindromes = function (word) {\n      //split the string into each letter, into an array\n      let splitWord = word\n        .toLowerCase()\n        .replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '')\n        .split('');\n    \n      console.log(splitWord);\n    \n      let reversed = [...splitWord].reverse();\n      console.log(reversed);\n    \n      let cleanedString = splitWord.join('');\n      let reversedString = reversed.join('');\n    \n      return cleanedString === reversedString;\n    };\n    \n    palindromes('car!');",

        "author": "FitPlantain4281",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I'm working on an app that essentially allows you to log things you do throughout the day. So if I wake up at 7 AM and do Yoga on September 2, then later I look at the logs for September 2, I will see that I did in fact do Yoga at 7 AM.\n\nI'm really struggling with timezones, mainly because I have it in my head that times should always be stored in UTC, and it's a headache to get working.\n\nThe standard advice is to store it in UTC and then convert to the users timezone when retrieving it, but this doesn't work here since I always want to see the log time relative to the timezone I was in at that time, not the one I'm in now (so if I was in California on September 2 when I did Yoga, then later I look at the log while I'm in New York, I still want to see that I did it at 7 AM, not that I did it 10 AM Eastern.)\n\nSo the solution I came up with is to store started\\_at and ended\\_at in UTC, and also store the timezone offsets for wherever the user was at that time, that way I can always display the correct time for the logs. However, this seems really inefficient from a database indexing perspective. 99% of the log queries on the app are for a specific calendar day according to the users location on that day. Which means looking up logs for a specific day goes from the built in database timestamp magic, to having to query every log in a 3 day range, calculate the times adjusted for the saved timezone offset of that record, and then check if the date matches. \n\nSo I also added a relative\\_start\\_date and relative\\_end\\_date to every log, which always stores whatever calendar date the log was started and finished on according to the user's timezone at that time. This way queries can easily be searched by date.\n\nThe system kind of works, but I keep second guessing if it's really the best way. It feels like a lot of work and a lot of somewhat overlapping fields (started\\_at, ended\\_at, relative\\_start\\_date, relative\\_end\\_date, start\\_time\\_zone\\_offset, end\\_time\\_zone\\_offset) just to keep track of the time. It almost feels like it would be easier to just store the calendar date and then store start\\_time and end\\_time as seconds from midnight (and maybe an optional end\\_calendar\\_date for cases when the log spans two days), but I have it in my head that this is wrong and times should always be in stored in UTC.\n\nWhat do you guys think? How would you store times in this situation? ",

This is my first time creating a web application, and so far I have create parts of the front end, and I am looking into creating lists of problems.\n\nNow, this is my first time looking into databases, and from what I have heard, SQLite and PostgreSQL are recommended the most for personal projects. I am wondering what is best for storing my problems, and its related data.\n\nSince the problems lists won't be that large, and won't be changing much, I was thinking of using SQLite, as from what I have heard it is the most simple to get up and running.\n\nNow, I have also been thinking about allowing users to create accounts on the site, and that may require the use of a more capable database, since there would be more frequent changes happening to the DB, which PostgreSQL might be better for this.\n\nLastly, I have also taken into the consideration of using both DB's, one for the problems, and the other for handling users, but I am not sure if this is a wise decision. If this is feasible, then it would allow me to focus on SQLite for the problems, and then PostgreSQL when implementing users.\n\nI was just wondering about what the best approach is, thanks in advance.",

        "content": "Hi, I got a 5 last year on AP Computer Science A and enjoyed coding with Java the entirety of last year. I want to continue coding further however I’m so lost on what to do in order to continue. I know a big thing with Java is android app development, however I don’t daily drive an android.\n\nBut just in general, I don’t have the slightest idea on where to go to develop even just simple .exes or apps on my computer. I know the Java covered in the AP class is obviously not enough but I have no idea where to go next after all the material learned in the class.\n\nThe big thing I want to do with coding is mostly just developing apps (specifically for homebrewed devices like my 3DS) but even then I don’t know how to make an app in general. I know app development takes a pretty big commitment to do, but I just want to try even if it’s just on my free time. Another thing would just be making mods on games I play.\n\nAlso another question is if I should just learn a different language like C++, as that has much more use cases (for me atleast) or if something like Java is enough. \n\nSo I’m just wondering what I can do with my knowledge from the class and where to go next.\n\nIf you guys can share some resources, that would be seriously appreciated.\n\nThanks",

My masters program ever so slightly touched on some technical aspects of computing, and I kind of got the bug for it intellectually.  I started learning a few languages, but I've always been the type of person who needs to understand why something rather than just how. Thus, I've decided to learn computer science in a real way, which led me to SICP.\n\nLook, I'm not dumb, but damn this book makes me feel like a moron.  I'll be reading and getting it pretty well, and then it throws an exercise at me that makes me question my worth as a human being.\n\nSome of the exercises are fine, and I get it mostly right and understand what's going on with my mistakes, but some just feel way beyond me (it's the Simpson rule exercise that prompted me to write this btw).\n\nI guess I'm just wondering if this is a normal feeling, or do I need a new hobby?  Again, to be fair, I actually feel like I have a pretty decent understanding of what the book is getting at; working through recursions from recursive and iterative frames was really instructive, and seeing the general summation formula was a big eureka moment for me, but good God that exercise brought me right back down to earth.",

Then, with the basics down in Python, moved on to HTML. Learning with FreeCodeCamp full stack curriculum now, like it better as there is more involvement and actual coding. Should I just continue with the course (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, front end libraries, and then Python) or should I finish Python first and then move on to the front end? Equally interested in learning web development and machine learning. Do I need to know lots of Python for machine learning? Which one should I learn first?

Because of that, I'm actually much closer to getting a CS degree than an SE degree in terms of coursework.  I've read a few discussions about which degree people should go into from an interest POV, but I'm asking purely from a practical employability POV.  Some people have noted that WGU's SE degree might not be as mathematically rigorous as others, but it is ABET-accredited, which seemed to be the differentiator for Mechanical Engineers when I worked as an intern (non-ABET were essentially looked at as a liability).\n\nMy questions are: \n\n\\- Does one degree have better job prospects in this market?   \n\\- SE doesn't require much math; is it looked at in a different light because of that?  \n\\- If I stay in SE, should I list my completed math classes in the education section of my resume?  Will that be a differentiator?\n\nI'm enjoying SE, but if I can graduate earlier, that would also be great, and if they are relatively equivalent or if SE is somewhat worse, my only argument for staying in SE is that I'll be taking more classes and therefore possibly will learn more.  \n\nAny advice on that is appreciated, thanks!",

I can solve a problem (in due time), with some help of either colleagues, internet, or LLMs, but I reckon there are people (mostly on youtube) that are like a few levels above me, like 11-12/10, I can't follow their reasoning most of the time.  \nAlso some people's ability to read a problem for the first time, and immediately come up with the optimal solution, is astonishing, while I have to iterate multiple times, and not without errors.\n\nSo I guess, my question is more for the people with some experience on their side, either in corporate or in startups, or for big personal projects. How do you become a better programmer and a better problem solver?\n\nI'm not looking only for answers like \"Read X book from Y\" (although they are appreciated), but I am looking for what changed your approach in programming, problem solving, that made you go from \"I am able to read some code, write normal/trivial functions\" to \"I can start from an idea and turn it into a functional program, with all its libraries/dependancies developed from scratch\".",

        "content": "**EDIT: To everyone obsessing about the 4 years, yes you all are correct that there was a spike in 2021 and I was aware of that. I did my math wrong by half a year. So 3.5 years. Either way, my point still stands. Downturn started in 2022 and hasn't improved since, which again is longer than any other downturn I have seen in tech prior. See FRED graph for the downtrend starting at that point and hasn't gone up since. Lets try to stick to the point of the post and not distract from the conversation over half a year.**\n\nAll I constantly hear in this field is \"its cyclical\" and right now is part of a cycle. I am not aware of any other cycle in tech history where the job market has been this bad for this long. Its been nearly 4 years now of a horrible job market and it is only getting worse it seems.\n\nFRED data shows too that right now job posting are as bad if not worse than the worst part of the pandemic, when hardly anyone was hiring. That doesn't factor in all the new games that are being played, like posting of ghost jobs. Factor in that, and it is probably way worse.\n\nAlso, jobs on the broader market just got revised down by almost a 1 million jobs today. Meaning, they overestimated the amount of jobs created by close to 1 million jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, companies \"still can't find qualified candidates\" and we continue to approve more and more visas in the US for mainly tech jobs. Nevermind the massive trend of now shipping jobs overseas or nearshore. Nevermind too the AI going on as well. Yes, I realize that much of the AI stuff is overhyped, but this sub is in denial if they think that hasn't affected hiring trends as well.\n\nI'm sorry, what is this jobs market anymore? When does this madness stop?",

        "author": "d_wilson123",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "It has been a career bucket list item to work at a startup that is just getting off the ground.  I joined as a staff engineer on a central platform team with one other engineer.  Eventually the team grew to 4 engineers.  As startups tend to do the financials struggled and the team was let go.  However with everything I learned I could confidently speak about almost all parts of platform engineering with hands-on confidence I did 1 interview which resulted in 1 offer.  [Note: It was a company I had previously worked for and knew lots of people.  This isn't a brag about getting a job in a struggling market so this context is important.]  Here is some of my experiences.\n\nWorking at large companies things tend to be somewhat figured out.  A typical question I would get when interviewing new engineers for roles on the team was about what the most difficult part of the job is.  My honest answer was always there was me and another engineer.  If we didn't know the answer that means you have to figure it out because no one else at the company knows.  These are some of the parts of the job I always knew about but lacked working hands-on:\n\n\n**DNS** - At every company I worked for DNS was managed by another team, typically SREs.  I knew about various record types and all that and I knew how to dig a DNS record but here we had to setup the R53 ourselves, purchase the domains ourselves, setup the subdomains ourselves and setup all the record ourselves.  We had to figure out how to manage this in a sustainable way so DNS isn't spread across a bunch of AWS accounts and do that in a secure fashion.\n\n\n**CICD** - Of course every engineer oftentimes interfaces with CICD.  My experience was typically extending some scripts someone else wrote to do most of the hard stuff.  The cluster was owned and operated by someone else.  But we had to figure out what CICD to use, how to integrate it into our pipelines, how to build our services, how to house containers, how to deploy the services.  There was no service builder helper to extend it had to start from scratch.\n\n\n**App Startup** - The companies I worked for already had app startup figured out.  There was some framework you'd implement which would give you logging, metrics and some form of observability for free out of the box.  But we had to figure out how to get these apps running and build out this framework ourselves.  This even included selecting which language to use for our platform, how to structure the project and coding standards.\n\n\n**Infrastructure** - Every place loves to interview you on scalability but I've personally always found it somewhat abstracted away from me as the developer.  My job was to crunch the code to make my container and it was someone else's job to scale it up or at least provide a convenient way to do so - usually some core tech team.  At the very least usually stuff before it hits your code is owned and operated by someone else.  Now again we leveraged AWS so lots of it is batteries included.  The API Gateways scale, if we're using serverless it scales, if we're using a managed database it scales.  But not everything was managed.  So we typically had to write out the entire infrastructure diagrams ourselves and find scale points.  This allowed me to walk into system design interviews not just spewing out memorization about various scaling techniques I actually had to live and breathe it for a long time.  Questions about trade offs and decisions were now extremely easy to talk about because these were things I actually had to solve personally.\n\n\n**IAC** - I lacked a lot of Terraform know-how going into the job.  So even simple questions which I now know as Terraform 101 such as \"How do I save this state file from my ephemeral CICD node?\" were complete unknowns.  We had to figure out basically everything Terraform from scratch.  Companies I've worked for in the past usually didn't expose Terraform to me directly.  They were hybrid bare metal and public cloud options.  So we had some form of IAC but it was always proprietary to the company, usually owned and managed by someone else and typically pared down.  So this gave me direct exposure to how to describe my infrastructure as code including things like I said about how to save state files, how to tag my resources, how to manage int/dev/stage/prod environments and all of that.  My previous experience was just writing some YAML and it was someone else's job to interpret all of that.\n\n\n**Observability** - Like I said previously usually this is something included in the app framework of the company.  But this gave me experience setting up Grafana (our tool of choice), pumping or replicating logs to it, setting up collectors for metrics, setting up alerting and all the dashboarding.  The alerting and dashboarding I'm sure most people have had experience with but usually for logging and metrics I'd just have to inject something into my application and it \"just worked\" without having to think about it too terribly much.\n\n\nThis is a long winded post and not a question at all but more a bit of advice.  If you are given the opportunity to work at a very early stage start up I highly recommend it.  My end result was the same as most early start ups - I got let go.  However I feel it made me a much more employable engineer that now can talk about times I actually built a lot of components that go into a backend platform.  I don't need to talk about these things in the abstract, which of course is still important to understand, but I can speak to them in the concrete now.  It was a fantastic growing and learning experience for me, personally.",

I jumped into what looked like a safer and more stable position. The onboarding was smooth and everyone was friendly but then reality hit me on day one.\n\nThe department I joined is basically one guy and now me. The entire workflow is a storm of spreadsheets and manual emails. I realized almost immediately that the whole thing could be automated with a few scripts and dashboards. What currently takes a week could be done in a couple of hours. Which means the existence of the department itself is hanging by a thread.\n\nHere is the catch. To actually automate I would need direct access to the system and that access has to go through my boss. Doing it on my own is impossible without going through him, and going through him means making myself a direct threat to his role and survival.\n\nOn top of that, in just two days of onboarding I was already dumped with actual work, despite only having the most superficial understanding of their processes and tools. The approach was basically “just figure it out.” There is no documentation at all, and to make it worse the processes themselves are arbitrary. One client gets handled one way, another client gets handled completely differently, with no clear rules or references for why things change. It feels random, improvised, and fragile.\n\nTo make things worse the company has its own AI and digital transformation division. If they ever notice what is really going on, they could easily absorb or eliminate this function. Which leaves me in a place where my job is both fragile and painfully boring.\n\nNow I feel stuck. If I leave too soon my résumé will show a disastrous short stay and I will look unreliable. If I stay I risk wasting my time in something that feels pointless and might get axed anyway. Right now my plan is to keep my head down for a while and later reframe the story as “I improved and automated processes and then decided to move toward project or team management because there was no further path in that role.”\n\nI know a lot of people here have been through bad career moves. I just needed to share this because right now it feels like I made one of the worst professional choices of my life",

        "title": "Amazon System Design : What Actually Happens (2025 Guide)",
        "author": "Bushwookie_69",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "If you're preparing for an Amazon SDE interview, you're probably wondering what the system design round actually looks like. Not the generic advice you find everywhere, but what really happens in that room (or video call).\n\nI've collected insights from engineers who've recently been through the process, and what I found might surprise you. The Amazon system design interview has evolved significantly, and if you're still preparing with outdated materials, you're setting yourself up for a rough time.\n\n# When You'll Face System Design\n\nLet's clear this up right away, because there's a lot of confusion about this.\n\n**SDE1 (Entry Level):** Usually no system design. You might get basic object-oriented design questions, but full system design is rare. If you're a new grad or have less than 2 years of experience, focus on coding rounds instead.\n\n**SDE2 (Mid-Level):** This is where it starts. You'll face at least one system design round, typically lasting 45-60 minutes. The questions are scoped appropriately they won't ask you to design all of AWS, but they will test if you can think beyond just writing code.\n\n**SDE3 and Above (Senior):** Expect 1-2 system design rounds, and they get serious. The Bar Raiser might throw you a curveball system design question too. At this level, they're evaluating if you can own and architect significant portions of Amazon's infrastructure.\n\n**Phone Screen vs Onsite:** Here's something people don't realize system design can appear in phone screens for SDE2+ roles. It's not just an onsite thing anymore. One engineer told me they got a 30-minute system design question during their phone screen, which caught them completely off guard.\n\n# The Interview Format\n\nHere's exactly how those 45-60 minutes typically break down:\n\n**Minutes 0-5: The Setup** The interviewer presents the problem, and here's the thing it's intentionally vague. They might say something like \"Design a system to handle package tracking for Amazon deliveries.\" That's it. No requirements, no scale, nothing.\n\n**Minutes 5-15: Requirements Gathering** This is where most candidates mess up. They jump straight into drawing boxes and arrows. Don't do that. Ask questions. Lots of them.\n\nReal questions you should ask:\n\n* \"What's the scale we're talking about? Thousands of packages or millions?\"\n* \"Do we need real-time updates or is eventual consistency okay?\"\n* \"What's our budget constraint?\" (Yes, Amazon cares about cost)\n* \"Are we building this from scratch or can we use existing AWS services?\"\n\nOne SDE3 shared that their interviewer specifically noted they were impressed when asked about cost implications. That's pure Amazon thinking right there frugality is one of their leadership principles, and it should show in your design.\n\n**Minutes 15-35: High-Level Design** Now you start drawing. But here's what's different about Amazon they want to see you think about their ecosystem. If you're designing a notification system and don't mention SNS or SQS, you're missing the mark. They expect you to know basic AWS services.\n\nYou'll sketch out your components:\n\n* Data flow\n* Major system components\n* Database choices (and why)\n* API design\n* How components communicate\n\n**Minutes 35-50: Deep Dive** The interviewer will pick one component and drill down. \"Tell me more about how you'd handle the database.\" or \"What happens when this service gets 10x the traffic?\"\n\nThis is where the interview gets interesting. They might suddenly change requirements. \"Oh, I forgot to mention, we need to support 10 million packages per day.\" How does your design hold up? Can you adapt without starting over?\n\n**Minutes 50-55: Trade-offs and Wrap-up**\n\nThey'll ask about trade-offs in your design. Not specific product names, but concepts like: \"Why did you choose NoSQL over a relational database?\" \"What are the downsides of your approach?\" \"How would you handle data consistency with your chosen architecture?\" \"What would you monitor to ensure this system is healthy?\n\n# What Amazon Actually Asks\n\nWhile other companies might ask you to design generic systems, Amazon focuses on their actual operational challenges. Here's what they really ask about:\n\n**Real Examples from Recent Interviews:**\n\n* Design a distributed inventory management system\n* Design a monitoring platform for internal microservices\n* Design a package routing optimization system\n* Design a fraud detection pipeline for returns\n* Design a CDN for Amazon's static content\n* Design a warehouse robot coordination system\n\nNotice a pattern? These are all Amazon-specific problems. They're operational, practical, and tied to real business needs.\n\nOne engineer interviewing for SDE3 was asked to \"Design a system to track and optimize delivery driver routes in real-time.\" The interviewer wanted to see:\n\n* How they'd handle GPS data from thousands of drivers\n* Cost optimization\n* Real-time rerouting capabilities\n* Integration with existing Amazon systems\n\nAnother candidate for SDE2 got: \"Design a simple notification system for order updates.\" This isn't some generic problem it's something Amazon handles millions of times daily.\n\n# How Leadership Principles Show Up\n\nAmazon evaluates your system design through their Leadership Principles lens:\n\n* **Customer focus:** Your design should prioritize user experience. Fast response times, reliable service, good error handling.\n* **Cost awareness:** Don't over-engineer. If you're using 100 servers when 10 would work, they'll notice.\n* **Scalability:** Your design should handle growth. They'll often ask \"What if traffic increases 10x?\"\n* **Technical depth:** Be ready to explain details. If you mention a database, know why you chose it over alternatives.\n\n**The Bar Raiser's Perspective**\n\nThe Bar Raiser ensures new hires improve the team's overall quality. They're trained to be objective and look for:\n\n* Clear technical reasoning\n* Ability to handle changing requirements\n* How you make trade-offs\n* Whether you can explain complex ideas simply\n\nThey have veto power but rarely use it. Their main job is ensuring the interview process is fair and thorough.\n\n# Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\nBased on what I've heard from both successful and unsuccessful candidates:\n\n**1. Over-engineering**\n\nKeep your design appropriate for the stated requirements. If the problem is US-only, don't design for global deployment.\n\n**2. Ignoring Cost** Amazon runs on thin margins. If your solution requires 1000 servers when 100 would do, that's a red flag. Always think about cost optimization.\n\n**3. Not Knowing AWS Basics**\n\nYou don't need to be an AWS expert, but knowing S3, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, and Lambda is expected for SDE2+. Building a custom solution when an AWS service already exists shows you didn't do your homework.\n\n**4. Forgetting About Operations** How do you monitor your system? What metrics do you track? How do you handle deployments? Amazon thinks about Day 2 operations, not just Day 1 launch.\n\n**5. Not Asking Clarifying Questions** As Amazon's own interview prep states: \"Expect at least one question on software systems design\" and \"Your interviewer will ask questions related to your design, and you should ask questions to complete and validate your design.\" The ambiguity is intentional they want to see how you handle it.\n\n# Preparation Tips\n\nHere's how to actually prepare for the Amazon system design interview:\n\n**Study AWS Services** You don't need to know everything, but understand:\n\n* S3 (object storage)\n* DynamoDB (NoSQL)\n* RDS (relational databases)\n* SQS/SNS (messaging)\n* Lambda (serverless)\n* CloudFront (CDN)\n* ElastiCache (caching)\n\n**Practice Amazon-Specific Scenarios** Instead of generic problems, practice:\n\n* E-commerce systems (shopping cart, inventory)\n* Logistics (routing, tracking)\n* Internal tools (monitoring, deployment)\n* Cost optimization problems\n\n**Read Amazon Engineering Blogs** Amazon's engineering blog has real architecture deep-dives. Reading how they actually built Prime Video's architecture is more valuable than memorizing generic patterns.\n\n**Mock Interviews with Constraints** Practice with realistic constraints:\n\n* \"System must handle 100,000 daily active users\"\n* \"Data must be retained for 90 days\"\n* \"API response time under 200 ms\"\n\n**Learn to Handle Curveballs** Practice having requirements change mid-design. If someone says \"actually, make that 100x the scale,\" can you adapt without panicking?\n\n# Your Game Plan\n\nLook, the Amazon system design interview is challenging, but it's not impossible. The key is understanding what they're actually looking for: engineers who can build practical, cost-effective systems that scale.\n\nHere's your action plan:\n\n1. Learn basic AWS services (spend a weekend on this)\n2. Practice 5-10 Amazon-specific design problems\n3. Always include cost in your discussions\n4. Think about operations and monitoring\n5. Be ready to adapt when requirements change\n\n# The Real Questions They're Asking\n\nAfter talking to engineers and collecting real interview experiences, my team and I realized there's a huge gap between what people study and what Amazon actually asks. We've been collecting actual system design questions from recent Amazon interviews complete with the specific constraints and requirements the interviewers used.\n\nWe built [leetwho.com](http://leetwho.com/) to share these real questions. It's not another tutorial site it's actual problems from actual interviews, organized by company and level. When Amazon shifts their focus (like their recent emphasis on ML system design), we know within weeks because our contributors are actively interviewing.\n\nIf you want to practice with what Amazon actually asks instead of generic problems, check out our collection. We keep it updated with the latest patterns and questions.\n\nRemember, the Amazon system design interview isn't about having perfect answers. It's about showing you can think like an Amazon engineer: customer-focused, cost-conscious, and capable of building systems that actually work at scale.\n\nGood luck with your interview. You've got this.",

Applying to jobs feels pointless since I never hear anything back. Even applying to similar positions to the one I left at the end of 2024 I get rejected for. Do I just forget my degree and go work as a waiter? Surely there are jobs out there but clearly no company wants to take me.

        "content": "Im a mid-level engineer who got a new job this year. I was just given my first big project and am working with another mid-level engineer who has been here for about 2 years. We are both working under a PE who is leading the project. \n\nWe have distributed the work and at the start I was wrapping up some bug fixes that my manager asked me to complete. The other mid-level im working with is a really nice guy and he is really motivated which I like. The problem is he is almost too motivated to the point that he has just started coding like crazy and in the first week did some of the work on my plate. I've seen him push code on the weekends at like midnight. One time I asked him if he works onthe weekends and he says sometimes he's bored at home and watches tv and code. I politely let him know that we should work together and I dont want him to feel like he did everything. So he backed off some of my stuff a bit. \n\nBut throughout the project, it seems he is going 150% towards any little changes that need to be added. If we need to add a change, he has just added it. Since he has been here for 2 years, he knows which people to go to outside of us 3 for questions and a few times I heard he had a few meetings with people to discuss things, so i asked him to keep me included as well and to give me any resources of people in case I had questions. He has done better of doing that but a few times forgot to send me some useful stuff.  I was gone for a couple days and in those days he made some major changes. Again I think it's great, but now it feels like the whole code is practically his (maybe 70% of it) and the PE has noticed and even in meetings will talk more to him and say (let's call my co-worker mike for the example) \"Mike can you write a note and make that change\". Barely has directed me. \n\nI feel like I have to step in and say \"ill make this change\" or make it clear that ill do the change. I feel like anything I have discovered ill reach out to him and let him know but I can tell that when it comes to visibility it looks like he's doing 90%. He has done more but I think it's more like 60%-70%. I dont think Mike really is doing this to be spiteful or anything I just think he's one of those people who is just really motivated and just starts and doesnt stop. Again, i think that's great and it definetely has kept me in my feet but I also feel like im getting pushed out. \n\nI should say that I got laid off from my last job before I got this job and i think a reason for it was because I was slightly a more passive engineer and I feel like this could be held against me that Mike did 70% of the work and it may look like I was lazy on this project. \n\nHow can I better handle this situation?",

        "content": "**Original text:**  \nWas interviewing a candidate today, she is from India (not my choice) - EDIT: SEE BELOW FOR WHAT I MEANT HERE. She has solid experience 5 years. We're trying to fill a full stack .net and angular role (once again, not my choice). We had three sessions - get to know you, framework and language knowledge, and then LC easy (13 - Roman numeral to integer) with screen sharing.  She seems really stiff and nervous, but literally answers every question 100% accurately.\n\nFor the knowledge section it would usually take her a couple stabs and seconds of silence to get to the right / correct answer.\n\nMe: \"What is the best data structure for storing 10 million records in memory?\" Her: \"A list or array but for that many records I think you should use a dictionary.\"  \nMe: \"How would you handle a sql query that takes 30 seconds to return?\"  \nHer: \"blah blah blah, pagination, blah blah blah.\" (in a follow up questions she finally got to indexes\"  \nMe: \"What's SOLID\"  \nHer: \\*literally lists of the entire acronym correctly with what it means\\*\n\nI'm really skeptical at this point she either has notes, or is using chatgpt on another monitor. I'm personally fine with this, because I find it pretty easy to sus out and honestly only do this section because it's required by our HR department (I told them I wanted to do a single 2 hour long session with two LCs and a live project collaboration and skip the knowledge check and they were like \"no, that's not how we do it.\" >(ভ⤙ ভ \")<).\n\nThen we get to the LC. I share her a fiddle with the LC and tell her can use Visual Studio, or VS Code, or the fiddle - up to her. I tell her getting the solution isn't the important part - being able to explain her logic and thought process is. She then stumbles around with Visual Studio for like 3 minutes trying to create a solution, then switches to VS code - copies the fiddle into a FUCKING JAVASCRIPT FILE AND PROCEEDS TO RAW DOG THE C# WITHOUT SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING IN A JAVASCRIPT FILE. IN COMPLETE AWKWARD SILENCE TOO lol. I am floored. Is this cheating? Is she that nervous?\n\nBut the problem with the cheating scenario is I can see her working through the problem like I would. I.e. first create a method to iterate the string and break it into chars, then a method where she used a switch to get the int value, then she put the check for the previous char is less than in a static method, etc.\n\nAt the end, once again in complete fucking silence, she just dumps her javascript c# bastard child into the fiddle, runs it and gets the correct answer. I am so speechless at this. I ask her to explain her solution, which she does a decent job at and explains the business logic pretty well, then we drop from the interview.\n\nI use this same LC easy for pretty much every interview, and I literally have never seen such unhinged behavior in my life. My gut is telling me she just hates interviewing, but is secretly an interviewing chad and has done a TON of prep - but I also am out of the interviewee game - I haven't interviewed for a position since before COVID. Tell me, fellow gamers, is the cheating tech that good that it will tell you specifically how to fake reasoning out a solution? Or is it also giving nervousness / awkardness to you guys?\n\n**Edit**: I am leaving the original post body as to not receive criticism of secrecy. In my statement about the interviewee, I say \"*she is from India (not my choice)*\". What I meant by this is to say, I have no control over this decision - and to show that simplistic suggestions as \"just interview in person,\" won't work. Yes my company has an office in India that they could interview at, but there is nobody on my team or my boss' team that could do that for us. All five of my team leads are in N / S America. We do have employees on my team there, but they are all mid level. This is a senior role. I have in the past asked for support from other teams for this, but have been either ignored or told there isn't resources to support it.\n\nI personally fully support companies hiring everywhere in the world and employees being able to work everywhere in the world, at a good salary with no exploitation and nobody losing their jobs to accomplish this. Some of the best engineers I have ever worked with are Indian, both from collaborating across the world or as H1B on the path to green card and citizenship in the US. 🇮🇳 ❤️\n\nAlso, for this role, we cannot hire anywhere but in India as it is part of our companies expense budget for India. We are filling an open role from somebody who was already in India when I became manager of the team, who left some time ago. I can't go more into detail due to HR/Compliance reasons.\n\nI could have explained all of this above, yes, but I was already writing a really long post and wanted to just get to the point without detracting from it with a long winded explanation nobody could have wanted. Well here is the long winded explanation several have asked for.\n\nIf you felt my comments about the interviewees ethnicity or national origin were offensive or mean - I apologize.\n\nAlso for those that are wondering why I said (*once again, not my choice*) for .net / angular - yeah I fucking hate that shit. Eat 💩 angular team and microsoft. /s - .net isnt as bad as PHP. angular isnt as bad as jquery was. \\*\\*shudders\\*\\*",

I'm so tired of this process, I see my friends and people all around me getting FAANG+ offers and I can't even get interviews. Rising junior at a T20 school, 3.86 GPA and I don't know how I can get the experience they want. I'm only applying for internships for next summer. How am I supposed to build experience when I'm getting rejected from minimum wage startup internships right now?? I applied as a junior last year and didn't have any luck either.\n\nI've had my resume reviewed by many people around me. I've grinded personal projects. I've joined clubs and labs to try to get experience. I try to Leetcode for an hour every day but what's the point of Leetcoding if I never get to use it?? I don't clear resume screens enough to get OAs very often and even when I crush them I wake up to rejections every morning. Feels like I'm just throwing applications into a void.\n\nI've tried networking, coffee chatting and writing personalized messages to seniors on LinkedIn. I still get auto-rejected even with referrals. It's so crushing when I still haven't had an opportunity to talk to a HUMAN after all of this time.\n\nI hope I'm not the only one who's been going through this. I guess I'm trying to figure out what I have to do to get results. I'm willing to put the work in I'm just confused on what I need to do: Is it my resume that's the issue? Is it the market? Or is this just a volume issue and I need to put in a thousand more. I've always had a passion for CS ever since I was a kid and I went into this major with a love for it but it's starting to fade.\n\nHere's my resume: [https://imgur.com/a/KlAex5v](https://imgur.com/a/KlAex5v)",

        "author": "btzmacin",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm a senior engineer (12 YOE), and a friend of the family's kid is a recent grad who, naturally, hasn't been able to land a job, given he didn't do any internships before graduating.  His dad asked me if there was anything I could do and I cringed, but told him to have the kid text me and I'd see what I could do to get him on track, but not to expect miracles.\n\nMy plan for advising him is to set expectations: not having any experience on his resume exiting college will make it impossible to land any engineering role in the current job market.  He probably needs to run a 3-year-long marathon to get where he wants to be.\n\nI think his only shot is going to be a tech-adjacent role, probably helpdesk or support, but maybe a business analyst or junior product/project manager role if he is incredibly lucky.  Of course, he needs to continue applying to junior engineer openings on the off chance they give him an interview, for the experience of interviewing alone.\n\nEven making these concessions, he needs to wrap his mind around 6 months to a year of applying everyday with nothing to show for it.  If his parents need him to contribute to the household, a McJob will be necessary to make ends meet.\n\nWhile applying, I'd have him come up with a product.  It doesn't have to be groundbreaking, disruptive, profitable, or even revenue-generating.  What's important is that he build it from zero, and that the result is usable by some audience.  To build the product, I'd advise him to leverage AI the same way we used to leverage stackoverflow.  Once he ships an MVP, he can include it on his resume, but he needs to continue to iterate on it.\n\nIf he lands a eng-adjacent role, he needs to stay there for 2 years at least to avoid being labeled as a job-hopper.  Keep working on the side project, or kick off a new one.  Automate tasks at work with and without AI.\n\nDid I miss anything, or is anything above way off base?  I don't want to scare the kid, but at the same time, this market is horrendous for seniors...I can't imagine having nothing but coursework on my resume right now.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This isn’t a CS career question, but this subreddit is full of smart minds (please suggest another sub if there’s somewhere else to take this)!  I’m about 10 years into my engineering career; self-taught and came into Disney as a senior mobile engineer, then left after five years to join a big tech.  I came into big tech at a pretty high level role for an IC, which sometimes gets into my head that I have imposter syndrome.\n\nAny job I’ve ever had in tech, I’ve been a high performer.  I got promoted at Disney after three months, highly unlikely because I’m any more skilled than anyone else (I’m definitely not), but probably I spent a weekend on a high-impact side project that was fun and had cross-functional impact, and I’m a good communicator.  I sort of coasted there, but big tech has been a gut punch.\n\nI’m 6 months into my role at big tech and was rated as an underperformer.  Given that I came in at a high level, I have no doubt the expectations were high, but I think I’m doing my best.  I say yes to a lot (often a curse), take on whatever is asked of me, and try to push through learning complex systems and very frequent uncertainty of what I should be doing every day.  I work with smart and very helpful people, but when I hit a technical glitch (often), rarely does anyone on my team have any solution that works, and I end up spending time finding more resources or trying to self-solve until I get it.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve ever been anything but a star performer.  I think I’m letting work for such a prestigious company get to me, but I also think I’m trusting colleagues to tell me where to focus each day and not delivering quickly at all because the systems are complex, ridden with issues, and while people try to help me, I don’t genuinely feel like I’m getting a lot of help or even know what questions to ask until I hit a problem.\n\nHas anyone else ever dealt with this?  I know this is nuanced, but it’s causing me serious anxiety.",

        "content": "I’m an early-career frontend developer, and I’ve been at my first job (a startup) for about 10 months now.\n\nFirst, I was assigned to work on a product that had quite a few bad practices - not type-safe, over a thousand TypeScript/linter errors, and a huge 10k+ LOC table component. With a lot of effort from me and my teammate, we managed to make it somewhat decent and easier to work with.\n\nApparently because I did a good job, I was thrown into another project that was built in-house, and honestly, I’m feeling extremely frustrated because it’s the same story all over again - the codebase is even harder to work with. Some examples:\n\n* Massive 2k+ LOC React components\n* Misuse of Context API for basically everything\n* Features tightly coupled, imagine component with 10+ useEffects, sockets, table column definitions, 10 level deep ternary operators, and subtle differences depending on \"mode\" - reused like 20 times throughout the app, used to display completely different entities.\n* Testing and modularization are basically nonexistent\n* Unclear dependencies (Entity info modal depends on a 2k LOC Loads context and on a common state that is consumed by chat modal, which depends on a 2k LOC NewLoads context, etc...)\n* This project is built on NextJS + It has a separate node backend. Why? Good question.\n\nHonestly, it’s just incredibly bad.\n\nI also position myself as a full-stack developer, so I took some tasks on the backend side - same story:\n\n* 8k+ LOC controllers mixing validation, service, and repository logic\n* Error handling? `res.status(500).json({ msg: \"Internal server error\" })` \\- lol\n* Not using prepared statements (hello SQLi)\n* No pagination in a logistics app\n* Why assign some common processed data into a shared variable, when you can just copy and paste the processing part.\n* Copy-pasted logic with zero abstraction\n* Lots of inconsistencies (e.g., phone field required in some places, optional in others)\n* No tests and probably untestable - ZERO classes in a 100k LOC codebase\n\nSo, honestly, I am extremely frustrated. It feels like everything I learned about writing maintainable code is being wasted.\n\nI’m considering leaving for a healthier codebase, but since this is my first job and I don’t have a formal CS degree, I’m worried about how it’ll look. I want to grow my skills, especially in maintainable React development, but I don’t want to feel stuck in this mess forever.\n\nSo my questions:\n\n1. Is it reasonable to leave a first job after 10 months because the code is unmaintainable?\n2. How do I frame this experience positively in interviews?\n3. Any tips for surviving in such a codebase?\n\n  \nEdit: Is the industry really in such bad shape? How come software engineers are paid so well when so many overlook even the basics?",

She gets some equity too, but I’m not sure the numbers.\n\nSo my wife and I together currently have a TC of about ~$310,000 or so.\n\nIf I take the FAANG offer, we will have to move which means my wife must quit her job. She will look for a new job, but we don’t know how long that search would take or what level she would end up at after finding a job. We also have 2 young kids (both under 5 years old).\n\nThe FAANG position would pay me much better than my current role, but it comes with risk:\n\n(1) My wife will be out of a job for awhile\n(2) FAANG layoffs happen all the time, and we would have to uproot our family and buy a house in the bay area. What if layoffs happen right after we move there? My current role - while paid much lower - is essentially guaranteed to not have layoffs (for at least another 2 years).\n\nI also work remote right now, so with this FAANG company I’d be going in office.\n\nWhat do yall think?

I was mostly targeting roles that required 1-3 YOE.\n\nI found that a lot of companies don't even ask leetcode questions anymore (probably because of cheating with AI). They mostly ask leetcode \"variations\" that are not algorithmically difficult, but instead are multi-part questions that require you to parse a lot of information and code up a solution very quickly given the time constraints.\n\nFor system design the bar seemed to be pretty low, which makes sense given my YOE.\n\n**Information**\n\n* Location: Toronto (applied in Canada + US)\n* YOE: 2 as a SWE\n* I am a Canadian Citizen\n\n**Preparation**\n\n* I spent a lot of time improving my resume and getting feedback on it from friends in the industry\n* Leetcode: Did most of grind 75\n* System Design: Mostly just used [hellointerview.com](http://hellointerview.com)",

During onboarding, that’s exactly what I was doing: learning their existing algorithms, analyzing data, and starting to get involved in core development.\n\nBut recently, my manager completely changed my responsibilities. Now, I’m doing hardware testing and working as a software integrator. This is not what I signed up for. To make it worse, I know there are open positions in the team for this kind of integrator work that have gone unfilled for months.\n\nI left the old job to work in Computer Vision. I would’ve never applied to be a software integrator. I feel misled and honestly kind of trapped.\n\nHow can I bring this up with my manager in a professional way? I’d like to return to the role I also don’t want to come across as uncooperative, especially being so new.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something like this before?\n\nThank you.",

I heard the behavioural is equally as important as the technical so I'm preparing and noting down stories/ answers / LPs I can potentially use for potential questions. My question is, should I try to answer every question with a STAR (L) story?\n\nObviously, questions like: \"describe a time ...\" or \"share an example\" should be answered in that format.   \n  \nBut how about questions that don't necessarily indicate they're looking for a story? Ex:\n\n  \nWhat do you do when you have a disagreement with someone on your team?  \nHow do you help a client figure out what they want when they’re not sure?  \nTell me about how you balance deadlines with day-to-day responsibilities\n\n\\- my question for all of these questions is:  \nShould I just respond back with how I do something or what I do?  \nOr should I coming up with a scenario where I did that?   \nOr, describe how I do it and then follow it up with a story describing when I did that?\n\nTell me about a goal you achieved.  \n\\- Another contrasting example, this one sounds different. It sounds like it's asking for a story.\n\n  \nThanks a lot!",

Very good benefits (free parking, free delivered lunch, free barista, free bar after 3pm, 10k education stipend, and a standard 401k match). ~1k employees but my team would have 4 people. I’d be in the engineering department of the company on the “Fintech” team. \n\nOption 2:\nTC ~200k (165 base + 10% bonus + 20k stock vest 4 years) with a tech stack that I am very familiar with but not interested in. I also don’t feel that I would learn / grow a lot here. Standard benefits (snacks and drinks, stipend for certifications, standard 401k match). <500 employees startup, and I would have 1 teammate. I’d be on the Business Apps team of the IT department of the company. \n\nMy feeling:\nI feel like I want to go with Option 1 because it just feels way better. The interviews with Option 1 were better and the people seemed much better. They also have a dedicated QA team, product managers, real SDLC, and AGILE with sprints while Option 2 has none of these. In addition, the problem set at Option 1 seems much more interesting to me, and the stipend would help as I want to get a MSCS / MCS as I am self taught and want to have a degree in CS. \n\nThoughts?\n\n",

Me and several others got on projects that lasted 2-4 weeks because our managers mislead our clients into thinking we were senior level and we told them we weren't when we started working and weren't as efficient as they expected us to be. \n\nSo, there are questions like explain how you used JIRA to collaborate and work more effectively as a team or a time where you used Spring Boot to increase productivity and enhance a service.   I've used both those tools, but coming up with such details of how I improved a legacy system with spring boot or more than just describing how JIRA works, I don't really have anything else to say.  It's just that I've been mostly working on coding skills and creating some services with the limitations of what I can do in a short time as only one person, and I can't give them the answers they want.  \n\nAm I supposed to lie and repeat other people's answers I find on the internet or is there a way to actually get this level of agile experience without working on an agile team first for long enough.  \n\nOne of those projects over the 3 months was a 2 month project where most of the time we were not doing anything because the client poorly planned the teams and 7 of us on a team that really only needed about 2 people with only a few services and very few bugs coming through on them.  \n\nAre there any teams that are actually designing something new or re-creating services requiring actual coding skills instead of just fixing minor bugs that take about 5 minutes or migrating from something like Maven to Gradle?  It seems all we've ever done is busy work on systems that were outdated and didn't learn anything as all we did was updated packages and fixed vulnerabilities that anyone can do. ",

        "author": "theploop",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone, not sure if this is the right place but I could use some advice.\nI’ve been working as a .NET web developer for a little over 5 years now, mostly on enterprise and government-type projects. I’d say I’m mid-level, maybe senior depending on the team. The thing is, I feel a bit stuck in my career. Moving toward a team lead role in .NET seems to require switching jobs, grinding harder technically, and pushing myself in ways I can’t really do right now for personal reasons.\nA friend suggested I look into Dynamics 365. His reasoning was that it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communication — which are actually strengths of mine. Plus, having a solid dev background might give me an edge compared to people who started directly in Dynamics.\nI did a bit of research and it seems like the Dynamics market is growing and there’s a clearer career path (especially with certifications). I get that certs alone aren’t enough without real experience, but at least the path feels more structured than in my current track. I’ve also heard people say Dynamics can be “boring” or “not real programming,” but honestly, I’m fine with that — stability and problem-solving are more important to me now.\nFor context, I’m currently in a financially good job, so I’m not desperate to switch. But I don’t want to stay stagnant either.\nSo my questions are:\n• Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?\n• What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?\n• Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?\nWould love to hear from people who are already in the field or made a similar switch.",

I've indicated that I'm very interested in the position, however I'm worried I may have been a bit too eager in showing my interest as the salary of the position wasn't disclosed, would require that I change from full-remote to hybrid, and the company is generally known for giving lackluster at best raises/promotions. I'm already on the lower end of the payscale for my current role, so I have a feeling they're going to try lowballing me on the salary extra hard for the new position by just offering like a 15% bump (for reference the low end of the band for the new role in my area on glassdoor/indeed is more like a 40-50% bump compared to my current salary), which I feel wouldn't be worth it at all when taking into account the additional responsibilities, costs of commuting, and degraded work/life balance. Assuming that the company does lowball me and isn't willing to budge, how would you guys recommend I handle things? Respectfully decline the position despite previously showing great interest in it and take this as a sign to start looking for a new position, or just grit my teeth and accept the lowball offer and try to leverage the new title to get a new job somewhere offering a salary and benefits more in line with what appears to be industry standard after 3-6 months in the new role?",

I say sort of cuz if you drew an architecture diagram of all 15 repos many of them would not touch or relate to each other.\n\n The 3 engineers traditionally did pair programming on these repos 100% of the time.\nNow that I've joined, it's 1 of their jobs to \"train\" me or bring me up to date, which constitutes of pairing on every ticket.\n\nThis for some reason does not help me learn. I feel like I am just watching someone who knows very well what they're doing write code without explaining anything. Half the time their tickers aren't even groomed out enough to know which of the 15 repos work is supposed to be done in, or even what the problem is clearly.\n\nThe previous engineers know how to solution because they've done the work a thousand times before, so they know exactly what repo and which file and what the problem is.\nBut for me, I have no idea.\n\nAnd there is no architecture diagram for most of the repos, no documentation explaining what the repos do, how they connect to each other, or even how to set up the dev environment beyond giving a few npm scripts to start the app.\n\nI feel like every time I ask questions like \"well what does this repo do\" they just answer like very vaguely \"well it just grabs this data and takes it here\" and it gives me like 10% understanding because they already know everything, so they're explaining it like I already know everything too.\n\nI'm trying to compile a list of all the repos GitHub's and all the URL's of the front end, and a documentation sheet of what each repo does, but I don't know what I don't know and this feels like it shouldn't be my job.\nBefore I passed my last project off to another team I made several confluence pages explaining the system, making diagrams, how to run locally, architecture etc. so when I passed the project over, the new devs had everything they needed.\n\nThis new team has none of that. Is it rude to ask them to make this documentation? Or am I just not asking enough questions? I don't know how to learn in a place where you don't even work in the same repo twice. Every time a new ticket comes up I'm diving into a repo I've never seen and I'm supposed to understand it well enough to finish the ticket with no background knowledge.\n\nI feel like usually you'd start a new dev on smaller bites but because we're pairing they just kinda threw me into the deep end.\n\nAny tips on how to succeed in this environment? I really like my company because of the work life balance and culture, so I don't wanna leave, especially in this economy. ",

        "content": "Recently started a role at company I just interned for. Cyber role, but I originally wanted to go for SWE. \n\nI have less than 3 months at the company and I am still applying. I was wondering if it is worse to have the full time experience on my CV and apply? Should I just leave it off? My thought process is that it isn’t enough time to show any value on resume. Or if it’s a bad look to be applying so soon after getting hired.\n\nThe other side of the coin being that having a job makes you a more desirable candidate or allows you to have more negotiating power. \n\nAlso, because it isn’t SWE experience, I just wonder if it will even be considered applicable experience. Job requirement has me coding maybe 40% of the time according to job posting. I’m still onboarding so I don’t actually know all of what I will be doing. \n\nI only have internship and this experience.",

        "content": "I've been developing software professionally for over 7 years now. I'm a certified AWS Solutions Architect and have designed and developed several full stack applications from the ground up. I've been feeling burnt out in my field for the last couple of years, and realized that I've always had a passion for robotics, but never got into it professionally as life took me down the full stack direction. I'm now determined to transition into robotics, even if it means going back to school for a masters, but I'm looking into other options to hopefully save time and money while still providing reasonable opportunities for me to land a job in the field. I have some experience with arduinos and pis, but I'm pretty much a beginner in this space.\n\nI came across this course https://www.theconstruct.ai/robotics-developer/ which looks promising if it could help me get a solid internship with a company, but was curious if others had recommendations for making this jump. I'm at the point where I'm planning to leave my current position in about 6 months and work on getting the needed education/portfolio full time until I land a new position. I want to fully commit to this rather than slowly transition over the course of a couple years. \n\nWith that being said, what are some options for transitioning into robotics as a career for someone who is already working in software? Anyone here working in robotics now that was previously full stack? Would love to hear any insights on this.",

After that, I have 6 years of experience in an IT Consulting firm - my job title said \"Consultant.\" I mostly worked on application support in production (incident management and bug fixes) for client projects, primarily on the backend which for the most part, involved a Java-based low code integration development platform and Oracle DB/SQL on the database side. Occasionally, I would use Core Java as and when needed. I also got familiar with version control and CICD concepts.\n\nWhile working on this job, I had been parallelly doing a lot of self learning on fundamental CS topics like Data Structures, Algorithm design and analysis. I eventually left to pursue a Master's in Computer Science from where I recently graduated. I have been practicing Leetcode and System Design. My goal is to get an SWE job.\n\n**My question: Does my earlier 6 years of experience in application support count as relevant experience for SWE roles? Should I aim purely for entry-level roles or can I also consider mid-level roles that need 2-3 years of experience? Will companies refuse to consider me for entry-level roles, in favor of people who just graduated from undergrad CS?**",
