        "content": "Ever tried loading 85GB of government data with encoding issues, broken foreign keys, and dates from 2027? Welcome to my world processing Brazil's entire company registry.\n\n# The Challenge\n\nBrazil publishes monthly snapshots of every registered company - that's 50+ million businesses, 60+ million establishments, and 20+ million partnership records. The catch? ISO-8859-1 encoding, semicolon delimiters, decimal commas, and a schema that's evolved through decades of legacy systems.\n\n# What I Built\n\n[**CNPJ Data Pipeline**](https://github.com/cnpj-chat/cnpj-data-pipeline) \\- A Python pipeline that actually handles this beast intelligently:\n\n    # Auto-detects your system and adapts strategy\n    Memory < 8GB: Streaming with 100k chunks\n    Memory 8-32GB: 2M record batches  \n    Memory > 32GB: 5M record parallel processing\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Smart chunking** \\- Processes files larger than available RAM without OOM\n* **Resilient downloads** \\- Retry logic for unstable government servers\n* **Incremental processing** \\- Tracks processed files, handles monthly updates\n* **Database abstraction** \\- Clean adapter pattern (PostgreSQL implemented, MySQL/BigQuery ready for contributions)\n\n# Hard-Won Lessons\n\n**1. The database is always the bottleneck**\n\n    # This is 10x faster than INSERT\n    COPY table FROM STDIN WITH CSV\n    \n    # But for upserts, staging tables beat everything\n    INSERT INTO target SELECT * FROM staging\n    ON CONFLICT UPDATE\n\n**2. Government data reflects history, not perfection**\n\n* \\~2% of economic activity codes don't exist in reference tables\n* Some companies are \"founded\" in the future\n* Double-encoded UTF-8 wrapped in Latin-1 (yes, really)\n\n**3. Memory-aware processing saves lives**\n\n    # Don't do this with 2GB files\n    df = pd.read_csv(huge_file)  # üíÄ\n    \n    # Do this instead\n    for chunk in pl.read_csv_lazy(huge_file):\n        process_and_forget(chunk)\n\n# Performance Numbers\n\n* VPS (4GB RAM): \\~12 hours for full dataset\n* Standard server (16GB): \\~3 hours\n* Beefy box (64GB+): \\~1 hour\n\nThe beauty? It adapts automatically. No configuration needed.\n\n# The Code\n\nBuilt with modern Python practices:\n\n* Type hints everywhere\n* Proper error handling with exponential backoff\n* Comprehensive logging\n* Docker support out of the box\n\n&#8203;\n\n    # One command to start\n    docker-compose --profile postgres up --build\n\n# Why Open Source This?\n\nAfter spending months perfecting this pipeline, I realized every Brazilian startup, researcher, and data scientist faces the same challenge. Why should everyone reinvent this wheel?\n\nThe code is MIT licensed and ready for contributions. Need MySQL support? Want to add BigQuery? The adapter pattern makes it straightforward.\n\n**GitHub**: [https://github.com/cnpj-chat/cnpj-data-pipeline](https://github.com/cnpj-chat/cnpj-data-pipeline)\n\nSometimes the best code is the code that handles the messy reality of production data. This pipeline doesn't assume perfection - it assumes chaos and deals with it gracefully. Because in data engineering, resilience beats elegance every time.",

        "author": "ssinchenko",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I often hear the question of why Apache Spark is considered \"slow.\" Some attribute it to \"Java being slow,\" while others point to Spark‚Äôs supposedly outdated design. I disagree with both claims. I don‚Äôt think Spark is poorly designed, nor do I believe that using JVM languages is the root cause. In fact, I wouldn‚Äôt even say that Spark is truly slow.\n\nBecause this question comes up so frequently, I wanted to explore the answer for myself first. In short, Spark is a unified engine, not just as a marketing term, but in practice. Its execution model is hybrid, combining both code generation and vectorization, with a fallback to iterative row processing in the Volcano style. On one hand, this enables Spark to handle streaming, semi-structured data, and well-structured tabular data, making it a truly unified engine. On the other hand, the No Free Lunch Theorem applies: you can't excel at everything. As a result, open-source Vanilla Spark will almost always be slower on DWH-like OLAP queries compared to specialized solutions like Snowflake or Trino, which rely on a purely vectorized execution model.\n\nThis blog post is a compilation of my own Logseq notes from investigating the topic, reading scientific papers on the pros and cons of different execution models, diving into Spark's source code, and mapping all of this to Lakehouse workloads.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not affiliated with Databricks or its competitors in any way, but I use Spark in my daily work and maintain several OSS projects like GraphFrames and GraphAr that rely on Apache Spark. In my blog post, I have aimed to remain as neutral as possible.\n\nI‚Äôd be happy to hear any feedback on my post, and I hope you find it interesting to read!",

In my experience is really hard to test sql scripts, usually sql files are giant blocks of code that need to be tested at once. Something we like about tools like pandas is that we can apply testing strategies from the software developers world without to much extra work and in at any kind of granularity we want. \n\nHow are you implementing data pipelines with DuckDB and how are you testing them?

        "content": "\"Start right. Shift left.\"\n\nIs that just another marketing gimmick in data engineering?\n\nHere is my opinion after thinking about it for the last couple of weeks.\n\nI bet every data engineer who's ever been exposed to data quality has heard at least one of these two terms.\n\nThe first time I heard ‚Äúshift left‚Äù and ‚Äúshift right,‚Äù it felt like an empty concept.\n\nOf course, I come from AI/ML, where pretty much everything is a marketing gimmick until proven otherwise. üòÇ\n\nAnd ‚Äústart right, shift left‚Äù can really feel like nonsense. Especially when it's said without a practical explanation, a set of tools to do it, or even a reason why it makes sense.\n\n  \nNow that I need to get better at data engineering, I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot. So...\n\n**Here is what I've come to understand about \"start right\" and \"shift left\".** (please correct if wrong).\n\n  \n**Start right**\n\nStart right is about detection. It means spotting your first data quality issues at the far right end of your data pipeline. Usually called downstream.\n\nBut not with traditional data quality tests. The idea is to do it in a scalable way. Something you can quickly set up across hundreds or thousands of tables and get results fast.\n\nBecause nobody wants to set up manual checks for every single table.\n\nIn practice, starting right means using data observability tools that rely on algorithms to pick up anomalies in your data quality metrics. It's about finding the unknowns.\n\nOnce that‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs way easier to prioritize which tables need a manual check. That‚Äôs where ‚Äúshift left‚Äù comes in.\n\n  \n**Shift left**\n\nShift left is about prevention. It's about stopping the issues you found earlier from happening again.\n\nYou do that by moving to the left side of the pipeline (upstream) and setting up manual checks and data contracts.\n\nThis is where engineers and business folks agree on what the data should always look like. What values are valid? What data types should we support? What filters should be in place?\n\n  \n\\---\n\nBy starting right and shifting left, we take a realistic and practical approach to data quality. Sure, you can add some basic checks early on. But no matter what, there will always be things we miss, issues that only show up downstream.\n\nThankfully, ML isn‚Äôt just a gimmick. It can really help us notice what‚Äôs broken.",

        "author": "godz_ares",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey all,\n\n[https://github.com/RubelAhmed10082000/CragWeatherDatabase](https://github.com/RubelAhmed10082000/CragWeatherDatabase)\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any feedback and any recommendations to improve my code. I was especially wondering whether a DuckDB database was the right way to go.  I am still learning and developing my understanding of ETL concepts. There's an explanation below but feel free to ignore if you don't want to read too much. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nMy project's goal is to allow rock climbers to better plan their outdoor climbing sessions based on which locations have the best weather (e.g. no precipitation, not too cold etc.).\n\nCurrently I have the ETL pipeline sorted out.\n\nThe rock climbing location Dataframe contains data such as the name of the location, the name of the routes, the difficulty of the routes as well as the safety grade where relevant. It also contains the type of rock (if known) and the type of climb.\n\nThis data was scraped by a Redditor I met called u/AmbitiousTie, who gave a helping hand by scraping UKC, a very famous rock climbing website. I can't claim credit for this. \n\nI wrote some code to normalize and clean the Dataframe. Some changes I made was dropping some columns, changing the datatypes, removing nulls etc. Each row pertains to a singular route. With over 120,000 rows of data.\n\nI used the longitude and latitude of my climbing Dataframe as an argument for my Weather API call. I used OpenMeteo free tier API as it is extremely generous. Currently, the code only fetches weather data for only 50 climbing locations. But when the API is called without this limitation it has over 710,000 rows of data. While this does take a long time but I can use pagination on my endpoint to only call the weather data for the locations that is currently being seeing by the user at a single time..\n\nI used Great-Expectations to validate both Dataframe at both a schema, row and column level.  \n\nI loaded both Dataframe into an in-memory DuckDB database, following the schema seen below (but without the dimDateTime table). Credit to u/No-Adhesiveness-6921 for recommending this schema. I used DuckDB because it was the easiest to use - I tried setting up a PostgreSQL database but ended up with errors and got frustrated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vkb85ebk7y6f1.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f13454a40df069957a5aaec7b2df111830c316\n\nI used Airflow to orchestrate the pipeline. The pipeline is run every day at 1AM to ensure the weather data is up to data. Currently the DAG involves one instance which encapsulates the entire ETL pipeline. However, I plan to modularize my DAGs in the future. I am just finding it hard to find a way to process Dataframe from one instance to another.\n\nDocker was used for virtualisation to get the Airflow to run.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rpquq7c8y6f1.png?width=1351&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c3720d0188006c25aabbf9931956bb63cf98637\n\nI also used pytest for both unit testing and features testing.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI am planning on increasing the size of my climbing data. Maybe all the climbing locations in Europe, then the world. This will probably require Spark and some threading as well. \n\nI also want to create an endpoint and I am planning on learning FastAPI to do this but others have recommended Flask or Django\n\n**Challenges:**\n\nDocker - Docker is a pain in the ass to setup and is as close to black magic as I have come in my short coding journey.\n\nGreat Expectations - I do not like this package. While flexible and having a great library of expectations, is is extremely cumbersome. I have to add expectations to a suite one by one. This will be a bottleneck in the future for sure. Also getting your data setup to be validated is convoluted. It also didn't play well with Airflow. I couldn't get the validation operator to work due to an import error. I also couldn't get data docs to work either. As a result I had to integrate validations directly into my ETL code and the user is forced to scour the .json file to find why a certain validation failed. I am actively searching for a replacement.",

        "content": "Hi !\n\nI know this isn't a UI subreddit, but wanted to share something here.\n\nI've been working in the data space for the past 7 years and have been extremely frustrated by the lack of good UI/UX. lots of stuff is purely programatic, super static, slow, etc. Probably some of the worst UI suites out there.\n\nI've been working on an interface to work with data interactively, with as little latency as possible. To make it ***feel*** instant.\n\nWe accidentally built an insanely fast rendering mechanism for large tables. I found it to be so fast that I was curious to see how much I could throw at it...\n\nSo I shoved in 100 million rows (and 16 columns) of test data...\n\nThe results... well... even surprised me...\n\n[100 million rows preview](https://reddit.com/link/1lb13ep/video/yeivgrn7wt6f1/player)\n\n*This is a development build, which is not available yet, but wanted show here first...*\n\nOnce the data loaded (which did take some time) the scrolling performance was buttery smooth. My MacBook's display is 120hz and you cannot feel any slowdown. No lag, super smooth scrolling, and instant calculations if you add a custom column.\n\nFor those curious, the main thread latency for operations like deleting a column, or reordering were between **120¬µs-300¬µs**. So that means you hit the keyboard, and it's done. No waiting. Of course this is not for *every* operation, but for the common ones, it's extremely fast.\n\nGetting results for custom columns were **<30ms**, no matter where you were in the table. Any latency you see via ### is just a UI choice we made but will probably change it (it's kinda ugly).\n\n  \n***How did we do this?***\n\nThis technique uses a combination of lazy loading, minimal memory copying, value caching, and GPU accelerated rendering of the cells. Plus some very special sauce I frankly don't want to share ;) To be clear, **this was not easy.**\n\nWe also set out to ensure that we hit a roundtrip time of <33ms UI updates per distinct user action (other than scrolling). This is the threshold for feeling instant.\n\nWe explicitly avoided the use of Javascript and other web technologies, because frankly they're entirely incapable of performance like this.\n\n***Could we do more?***\n\n*Actually, yes.* I have some ideas to make the initial load time even faster, but still experimenting. \n\n  \n***Okay, but is looking at 100 million rows actually useful?***\n\nFor a 100 million rows, honestly, probably not. But who knows ? I know that for smaller datasets, in 10s of millions, I've wanted the ability to look through all the rows to copy certain values, etc.\n\nIn this case, it's kind of just a side-effect of a really well-built rendering architecture ;)\n\nIf you wanted, and you had a really beefy computer, I'm sure you could do 500 million or more with the same performance. Maybe we'll do that someday (?)\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me know what you think. I was thinking about making a more technical write up for those curious...",

Know SQL, Python, Metabase (BI Tool).\n\nThe company I work for hires a third-party software company that has built and maintains custom apps and software for us including POS (point-of-sale) and Inventory Management software. Additionally, they built us a customer facing mobile application (we're a restaurant group).\n\nThey (the  software company) uses a Mysql version 5.7 database which I understand reached end of life in 2023. This has caused some annoyances like not being able to use dbt or upgrade past version 0.47.9 of Metabase. Recently, I asked them if we can/should upgrade to Mysql 8 at some point and if there is anything we should worry about since version 5.7 reached end of life (like security, tech debt, etc.).\n\nTheir response was \"It (5.7) is still widely used today and we don't need to worry about any vulnerabilities, we'll look into upgrading though\". Then after they \"looked into it\" they said it is best for us to stick with 5.7 for \"stability\". \n\nI am not a data or software engineer, but it SEEMS like what they really mean is \"It would be a lot of work for us to migrate everything over to version 8 and we don't want to deal with that\". I'm not saying it wouldn't be a lot of work, but my feeling is that using 5.7 is not as common as they try to make it out to be and they just don't want to deal with the upgrade and all that it entails.\n\nI'll say again, I know migrating over to 8 would likely take days/weeks/months(?) and is not just a \"click here to migrate and...done!\" kind of thing. The benefits may seem small - me being able to use things like ctes, window functions, the latest version of Metabase (which has some feature that would really benefit us) - but would nonetheless be a great improvement. \n\n  \n1) Is mysql 5.7 still that commonly used?\n\n2) Would most company's have already upgraded?\n\n3) Besides being an inconvenience, are there actual security issues to worry about if we don't upgrade?",

It‚Äôs been about a month, but I haven't gotten any \"pure\" data engineering projects yet. The company isn't fully tech-focused ‚Äî it's more into providing services like HR, payroll, audit, tax, etc.\n\nCurrently, I'm mostly working on building chatbots for CRM and sales teams, and I might do more AI and automation-related tasks in the coming months. The team here is quite small, and there might be some Data Lake projects coming later, but nothing is confirmed yet.\n\nIs it normal for DE interns to be doing this kind of work? Should I be concerned that I‚Äôm not working on traditional DE projects like pipelines, data warehouses, ETL, etc.? Its not like I dont enjoy this but I do want to build a career in data engineering, so I just want to make sure I'm on the right path.\n\nWould appreciate any advice or experiences!",

Better *security features*: lineage tracking, RBAC, and edge protections.\n\n*Second test (run by me):*\n- Recreated equivalent tables in Redshift for the same 6-month dataset.\n- *Findings*:\n  1. Redshift delivered *50% faster* performance on the same query.\n  2. *Zero ETL* in our pipeline ‚Äî leading to significant cost savings.\n  3.

I know this is generally forbidden in Kimball modeling, but its unclear to me what the right solution should be. \n\n  \nIn my scenario, I need to merge two concept from different sources: Stripe invoices and a Salesforce contracts. A contract maps 1 to many with invoices and this needs to be connected at the line item level, which is essentially a product on the contract and a product on the invoice. Those products do not match between systems and have to be mapped separately. Products can have multiple prices as well so that add some complexity to this. \n\nAs a side note, there is no integration between Salesforce and Stripe, so there is not a simple join key I can use, and of course, theres messy historical data, but I digress.\n\nDoes this relationship between Invoice and Contract merit some type of intermediate bridge table? Generally those are reserved for many to many relationships, but I'm not sure what else would be beneficial. Maybe each concept should be tied to a price record since thats the finest granularity, but this is not feasible for every record as there are tens of thousands and theyd need to be mapped semi manually.\n\n  \n",

        "content": "Hi everyone! I'm working on a data engineering problem and would love to hear your thoughts on my solution and how you might approach it differently.\n\n**Problem**: I need to create a unique user ID (cb\\_id) that unifies user identifiers from multiple mock sources (SourceA, SourceB, SourceC). Each user can have multiple IDs from each source (e.g., one SourceA ID can map to multiple SourceB IDs, and vice versa). I have mapping dictionaries like {SourceA\\_id: \\[SourceB\\_id1, SourceB\\_id2, ...\\]} and {SourceA\\_id: \\[SourceC\\_id1, SourceC\\_id2, ...\\]}, with SourceA as the central link. Some IDs (e.g., SourceB) may appear first, with SourceA IDs joining later (e.g., after a day). The dataset is large (5-20 million records daily), and I require incremental updates and the ability to add new sources later. The output should be a dictionary, such as {cb\\_id: {\"sourceA\\_ids\": \\[\\], \"sourceB\\_ids\": \\[\\], \"sourceC\\_ids\": \\[\\]}}.\n\n**My Solution**: I'm using Spark with GraphX in Scala to model IDs as graph vertices and mappings as edges. I find connected components to group all IDs belonging to one user, then generate a cb\\_id (hash of sorted IDs for uniqueness). Results are stored in Delta Lake for incremental updates via MERGE, allowing new IDs to be added to existing cb\\_ids without recomputing the entire graph. The setup supports new sources by adding new mapping DataFrames and extending the output schema.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n* Is this a solid approach for unifying user IDs across sources with these constraints?\n* How would you tackle this problem differently (e.g., other tools, algorithms, or storage)?\n* Any pitfalls or optimizations I might be missing with GraphX or Delta Lake for this scale?\n\nThanks for any insights or alternative ideas!\n\n",

It's designed to solve a few key problems:\n\n* Useful queries get written once, then lost forever in DMs or personal notes.\n* Constantly re-configuring database connections for different AI tools is a pain.\n* Most multi-database solutions are cloud-based, meaning your schema or data goes to a third party (no thanks).\n\nHere‚Äôs what it does:\n\n* Unifies all your databases with a one-step setup. Connect to PostgreSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc., and configure clients like Cursor and Copilot in a single step.\n* It runs locally on your machine, never exposes credentials, and enforces read-only operations by design.\n* Teaches the AI with your team's proven query patterns. Instead of just seeing a raw schema, the AI learns from successful, historical queries to understand your data's context and relationships.\n\nWe're in **open beta** and looking for people to try it out, break it, and tell us what's missing. All features are completely free while we gather feedback.\n\nIt's open-source, and you can find instructions to run it with Docker or install it via pip/uv on the GitHub page.\n\nIf you're dealing with similar workflow pains, I'd love to get your thoughts!\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)",

Of course, I also work with the Murex platform itself. While this is good experience, my long-term goal is to become a data engineer, so I‚Äôm teaching myself and trying to build relevant projects.\n\nSince a web app is not directly aligned with a data engineering path, I‚Äôve thought carefully about the tech stack and some additions that would make it valuable for my portfolio.\n\n**Stack**\n\n**Backend:**\n\n* Python (FastAPI), my main language and one I want to get more confident in.\n* SQLAlchemy for ORM\n* PostgreSQL as the main relational database\n\n**Frontend**¬†*(less relevant for my career, but important for the shop)*:\n\n* HTML + Jinja2 (or possibly Alpine.js for lightweight interactivity)\n\n**DE-related components:**\n\n* Airflow to orchestrate daily/monthly data pipelines (sales, traffic, user behavior)\n* A data lake for ingestion, to later use in dashboards or reports\n* Docker containers to manage Airflow and possibly other parts of the project‚Äôs infrastructure\n* Optional CI/CD to automate checks and deployment\n\n# My main questions are:\n\n1. Do you think it makes sense to merge DE with a web-based project like this?\n2. Any advice on how I can make this more relevant to DE roles?\n3. What features or implementations would you personally consider interesting in a DE portfolio?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n**TL;DR**: I'm building an e-commerce site (FastAPI, PostgreSQL) with integrated DE components (Airflow, Docker, data lake, optional CI/CD). Although the project is web-based, I'm aiming to make it relevant to a data engineering portfolio. Looking for feedback and suggestions on how to get the most value out of it as a DE project.",

        "author": "PuzzleheadedRule4787",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm working on a Python ETL on Databricks, and I've run into a very specific requirement where I feel like I need to interact with Spark's or Hadoop's more \"internal\" methods directly via the JVM.\n\n**My challenge (and my core question):**\n\nI have certain data consistency or atomic operation requirements for files (often Parquet, but potentially other formats) that seem to go beyond standard `write.mode(\"overwrite\").save()` or even the typical Delta Lake APIs (though I use Delta Lake for other parts of my pipeline). I'm looking to implement highly customized **commit logic**, or to directly manipulate the list of files that logically constitute a \"table\" or \"partition\" in a transactional way.\n\nI know that PySpark gives us access to the Java/Scala world through `spark._jvm` and `spark._jsc`. I've seen isolated examples of manipulating `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem` for atomic renames.\n\nHowever, I'm wondering **how exactly am I supposed to use internal Spark/Hadoop methods like** `commit()`**,** `addFiles()`**,** `removeFiles()` **(or similar transactional file operations) through this JVM interface in PySpark?**\n\n* **Context:** My ETL needs to ensure that the output dataset is always in a consistent state, even if failures occur mid-process. I might need to atomically add or remove specific files from a \"logical partition\" or \"table,\" or orchestrate a custom commit after several distinct processing steps.\n* **I understand that solutions like Delta Lake handle this natively**, but for this particular use case, I might need very specific logic (e.g., managing a simplified external metadata store, or dealing with a non-standard file type that has its own unique \"commit\" rules).\n\n**My more specific questions are:**\n\n1. What are the **best practices for accessing and invoking these internal methods** (`commit`, `addFiles`, `removeFiles`, or other transactional file operations) from PySpark via the JVM?\n2. Are there **specific classes or interfaces within** `spark._jvm` (e.g., within `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileFormatWriter` or `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem` APIs) that are designed to be called this way to manage commit operations?\n3. What are the **major pitfalls to watch out for**? (e.g., managing distributed contexts, serialization issues, or performance implications).\n4. Has anyone successfully **implemented custom transactional commit logic in PySpark** by directly using the JVM? I would greatly appreciate any code examples or pointers to relevant resources.\n\nI understand this is a fairly low-level abstraction, and frameworks like Delta Lake exist precisely to abstract this away. But for this specific requirement, I need to explore this path.\n\nThanks in advance for any insights and help!",

Right now it's probably closest to a BQ UI + data/looker studio mashup.\n\nIt has charts, dashboards, reusable SQL functions, and an optional LLM integration. Open source, all data is local, SQL generation is by default generated on a hosted server but you can run this locally to remove this dependency.\n\nTry it out [here](https://trilogydata.dev/trilogy-studio-core/), grab the editor source [here](https://github.com/trilogy-data/trilogy-studio-core), or just use the [language](http://github.com/trilogy-data/pytrilogy) without the editor. \n\nBuilt with: Typescript, Vue, Python, Vega\n\nFeedback is very much appreciated - it's a little barebones still, but wanted to see what resonates with people!",

        "content": "Hey ya,\n\nI am currently working for a so-called data platform team. Our focus has been quite different than what you probably imagine - implementing business use cases while making the data available to others and, if needed, also make the input data we need for the use case also available to others. For context: we are heavily invested in Azure and the data is quite small most of the time.\n\nSo far, we have been focusing on a couple main technologies: We ingest data as Json into an ADLS Gen 2 using Azure functions, process them with Azure functions in an event-driven matter, write them to a DB and serve them via REST API/odata. Pretty new is that we make data available via Kafka as events as an enterprise message broker.\n\nTo some extent, this works pretty well. However, for BI and Data Science cases it's a tedious to work with. Everyone, even power bi analysts, have to  implement oauth, paging, etc, download all the data and then start crunching them.\n\nTherefore, we are planning to make the data available in an easy, self-service way. Our imagined approach is to write the data as iceberg/delta parquet, make them available via a catalog and then consumers can find and consume them easily. Also, we want to materialize our Kafka topics as tables as well in the same manner as is promoted by confluent tableflow.\n\nNow, this is the tricky part. How to do it? I really like the idea of shifting left where capable teams create data as data products and release them e.g. in Kafka from which the data are forwarded to some delta table so that it fits everyone's needs.\n\nI have thought about going for databricks and omitting all the spark stuff, but leveraging delta and unity Catalog together with serverless capabilities. It has a rich ecosystem, a great catalog, tight integration with Azure and all the capabilities for managing access to the data easily without dealing with permissions on Azure resource level. My only concern is that it is kind of overkill since we have small data. And I haven't found a satisfying and cheap way for what I call kafka2delta.\n\nThe other obvious option is Microsoft fabric and kafka2delta is easily doable with eventstreams. However, fabric reputations are really bad and I hesitate to commit to it as I am scared that we will find many issues. Also, it's kind of locked up and the headless approach to consume the data with any query engine will probably not work out.\n\nI have put snowflake out of scope as I do not see any great benefits over the alternatives, especially with databricks' more or less new capabilities.\n\nIf we just write the data to parquet without a platform in the background, I'm afraid the data is not findable and easily consumable.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I thinking too big? Should I stick to something easier?",

Nothing too complex. Just practical enough to build confidence and show me how Python works in real life.\n\nHere are five that really helped me level up:\n\n1. File sorter Organizes files in your Downloads folder by type. Taught me how to work with directories and conditionals.\n2. Personal expense tracker Logs your spending and saves it to a CSV. Simple but great for learning input handling and working with files.\n3. Website uptime checker Pings a URL every few minutes and alerts you if it goes down. Helped me learn about requests, loops, and scheduling.\n4. PDF merger Combines multiple PDF files into one. Surprisingly useful and introduced me to working with external libraries.\n5. Weather app Pulls live weather data from an API. This was my first experience using APIs and handling JSON.\n\nWhile i   was working on these, i created a system in Notion to trck what I was learning, keep project ideas organized, and make sure I was building skills that actually mattered.\n\nI‚Äôve cleaned it up and shared it as a **free resource** in case it helps anyone else who‚Äôs in that stuck phase i was in.\n\nYou can find it in my profile bio.\n\nIf you‚Äôve got any other project ideas that helped you learn, I‚Äôd love to hear them.

Never worked for me. I feel like I've learned better and more effectively through having a MAIN course for something I want to learn and documentation as a SIDE-RESOURCE that I use to refresh my memory or learn new concepts quickly for a technology I'm already comfortable with. I want to learn the bigger picture, not just learn the modules in Node, and I feel like courses are great at explaining WHY something works and in what situations it is best in. I believe this is why I've enjoyed The Odin Project so much even though they heavily push on reading documentation. They don't just send you the link to JavaScript.info and tell you to read the whole thing, they give you little bits and pieces from the website and other websites for you to learn that specific concept and in their article they teach you the bigger picture of why you're even learning said concept and why the resources they're linking are good resources.\n\nNow, this is not to say that MDN, JavaScript.info, W3Schools and other websites are bad resources. I just feel like if my friend tells me tomorrow, \"Hey I want to learn HTML\". I wouldn't just tell them to download VSCode and read W3Schools. I'd give them different options like freeCodeCamp, programming with mosh's video, udemy courses, etc, and then they can read MDN to refresh their memory or revise new concepts. Or I'd ask them what their preferred method of learning is and we go from there.\n\nAt the end of the day, not everyone is going to feel comfortable learning the same way. Which is why we should keep that in mind and not tell the beginner, \"just dive in and read MDN when you get lost\". I feel like a lot of documentation out there isn't very beginner friendly, or doesn't go slow enough for that person to grasp the why's and how's of that technology.",

        "author": "yughiro_destroyer",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello!  \nWhen I started to learn programming a few years ago, I was introduced to OOP and I thought \"Woah, that's the best way to reason about data in programming!\". Over my experience as a programmer, I saw OOP to be highly encouraged in academy and to some degree even to my workplace.  \nAs I programmed more and more I started to hit tons of roadblocks that kept me from truly finishing my projects (mostly related to game development). It wasn't until I tried data oriented paradigms, such as an entity component system (ECS) that I saw better progress.  \nWith OOP, you have to plan very carefully how you plan your inheritance chain. You might initially make Player and Enemy inherit from Character but then decide that Player and Enemy share many things that you eventually make Player inherit from Enemy too. Then you also realize that Enemy should have a behavior you don't want Player to have. No matter what you do, you either load unused behaviors into the object or you are forced to rewrite the same code for two classes.  \nYour object can't be two things at one. Let's say you have fighters, archers and mages in your game - three classes. At some point, you want the player to be both an archer and a mage. How do you do that without complex or ugly workarounds like creating another class named FighterAndMage ? Or FigherAndMageAndArcher. Code gets ugly real fast.  \nEncapsulation is a useful trait for OOP to make code more secure but getts and setters can add a lot of boilerplate.  \nWith ECS you have a relation of \"IT HAS\" instead of \"IT IS\". An \"object\" is a collection of components (position, volume...) and a system is a function that operates on objects that have certain components. With this, adding new behaviors becomes easy plug and play, as adding or removing logic doesn't break the entire program.  \nIf I were to compare this to a real life application, OOP is like building a computer in one single circuit board - something breaks, the whole computer breaks. With ECS (or DOD similar paradigms) it's like building a computer from multile parts - if an SSD fails the rest of the computer keeps working. And refactoring or modifying an OOP class is very risky, especially if that happens to a parent class, beacuse there's no way how the children will react to those changes.  \nOOP through composition is an alternative to inheritance and cleaner in my view but there's still some issues a pure DOD paradigm doesn't have. For instance, a composed class Button that is made of class Position and class Volume needs the method \"pressed()\" which in fact will act on those two inner classes. But if you change the Volume and Position, it could break again, and what if you wanted to share \"pressed()\" to another class like \"CheckBox\" ? Will you inherit from \"Button\"? It's possible but that causes lots of chains to follow that at some point becomes exhausting to keep track of. With an ECS paradigm for example the entities are self explanatory - it has that component then it's subjected to this action.  \nI find OOP has use for creating data models or classes with unique behaviors no other class has. Or use composition to build bigger classes from smaller classes.  \nHow do you view this?",

Then I moved for full stack development for the best 3 years. I can do different frameworks, I can create beautiful production ready websites using React,...etc.\n\nThe issue is, I still cannot fit myself in any stack. I tried in my free time game development I was stuck because I failed to learn shaders  (I couldn't build a connection with the logic)  \nAlso, I am so bad at designing 3d or 2D. I tried low level coding and contribute to open source projects I got bored fast,...etc. Also, I tried AI for some time got bored fast\n\nI don't know what to do. Whatever field I join I get bored or I be like man that's not my place. The best thing I can do is full stack development but it's boring some random CRUD operations and doing the same security measures over and over.\n\nI hope to get answers from really old dudes in the field.\n\nOne last thing I forgot to mention: I‚Äôm currently a full-time software engineer, but I‚Äôm not specifically doing full-stack work. Instead, I‚Äôm assigned random tasks across many parts of the company‚Äôs systems, mostly to avoid getting stuck doing just one thing.\n\nAn Edit, Should I start game development for fun (again), and Will I be able to do something in game engines.

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to put this out there because I‚Äôve been struggling a lot with my growth as a developer and I think I need some external perspective and advice.\n\nI‚Äôve been working as a developer for about 4 years now. Recently graduated with a degree in CS, but most of my college years were during the pandemic‚Äîso, let‚Äôs just say the education wasn‚Äôt the most hands-on or practical.\n\nTo be honest, I feel like I‚Äôve skipped a lot of important steps in my learning journey. I learned (more or less) the basics for starters such as algorithm, datastrucutres and OOP, then jumped straight into building things with frameworks without really understanding the underlying principles or best practices. On top of that, I‚Äôve become overly reliant on AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.). They help me get things done fast, but I‚Äôm painfully aware that they‚Äôre also masking my gaps in knowledge and critical thinking when it comes to code design, architecture, and problem-solving.\n\nOn the job side, I‚Äôve never worked on a big team. All of my jobs and freelance projects have been solo. I‚Äôve literally never had a code review in my life. No senior devs to learn from. No one to point out my bad habits. As a result, I have no real benchmark for how ‚Äúgood‚Äù my code actually is. I‚Äôm constantly second-guessing myself‚Äîam I writing maintainable code? Am I using the right patterns? Am I leaving massive performance or security issues behind without realizing it?\n\nMy main focus has been backend development‚Äîworking with NestJS, building REST APIs‚Äîthat‚Äôs the part I actually enjoy the most. But I‚Äôve mostly worked fullstack because that‚Äôs what companies have been hiring for. I know I need to broaden my skills‚ÄîGraphQL, performance tuning, security best practices, proper testing strategies, etc.‚Äîbut I‚Äôm honestly lost on where to start and what‚Äôs most important to prioritize.\n\nAnother weakness: I‚Äôve never developed the habit of properly reading and understanding documentation. I‚Äôve mostly been learning through random tutorials, StackOverflow, and now AI. I know this is unsustainable long-term, but every time I sit down to ‚Äústudy‚Äù or deep dive, I get overwhelmed and default back to just shipping code.\n\nSo yeah‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm at a crossroads. I want to level up. I want to break this cycle. But I feel like I‚Äôve built my developer career on shaky foundations and now I don‚Äôt know how to rebuild while still working full time.\n\n**If anyone has been through something similar (or has advice on how to build real confidence and technical depth after years of winging it), I‚Äôd love to hear your perspective.**\n\nWhat would you focus on first if you were in my shoes? How do I realistically improve my fundamentals while balancing work?\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "content": "In high school (grades 9‚Äì11), I was the best student in my class at math. I really liked it and wanted to study higher mathematics.\n\nNow I‚Äôm studying Computer Science at university and aiming to become a software developer. My question is about the actual level of higher mathematics knowledge required for a programmer.\n\nOf course, math is essential, but the specific areas you need depend on your field. For example, machine learning and systems programming require deep knowledge of probability theory, statistics, linear algebra, mathematical analysis, and discrete math.\n\nTo create new algorithms or be an advanced developer, you definitely need higher math.\n\nHowever, here‚Äôs my problem:  \n\nI struggle to memorize all the theory presented in lectures. I don‚Äôt remember all the integration or differentiation methods. When I face a mathematical problem, I usually can't solve it right away. I have to look up the method or algorithm, study some examples, and only then can I solve it ‚Äî which takes time.\n\nSo I‚Äôd like to ask developers who regularly deal with advanced mathematics:  \n\nWhen you're faced with a math-heavy problem, do you immediately know which method to use and remember the formulas by heart? Or do you also have to look things up and review examples?\n\nAlso, will I fail an interview for a systems programmer or ML developer if I don‚Äôt know all the higher math theory by heart? What if I can't solve a math problem on the spot?\n\nLastly, I‚Äôm worried that in real work I‚Äôll spend too much time solving math problems, which might not be acceptable for employers. ",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Currently I have failed intro to data structures and algorithms once and had to withdraw a second time. \n\nA pattern I noticed is that most students in my class had experience in hackathons, programming clubs or even just working on projects through tutorials enough time to be fairly familiar with a programming language, whereas I only had occasional sporadic 1-2 hour studies of a programming video, mainly copying the code line by line and aimlessly googling every keyword in the documentation while being confused by the meaning of the syntax and still unable to make anything by myself, mainly being more concerned with schoolwork.  I would focus heavily on trying to understand math on a more conceptual level or at least get enough practice to be prepared for theoretical computer science, but I consistently failed when implementing algorithms for projects. \n\nI initially thought this failure came from not understanding the algorithm enough as a concept, and I tried to ask myself at which point I usually get stuck, since I could get through the basics taught in 'intro to java/x language' courses where they introduce variables, data types, pointers, etc.\n\nI tried to ask myself the simplest 'algorithm' I could imagine implementing from scratch- I thought  creating an algorithm to make the number 4 was not complicated, I could make int x =2 and write the following print(x +x). I thought that this analogy proved that any issue I had in terms of reading documentation and implementation came because I needed to reach a point of understanding where the algorithm was as familiar and intuitive as basic arithmetic, but this was not the case as when I asked my professor they said it is more important to focus on understanding the algorithm enough to properly implement it, but there was not enough time within the course to develop too deep of an understanding and such an understanding could not be developed without implementation regardless.\n\n  \nI felt stuck in a catch 22 because I could not move past \"tutorial hell\" due to a lack of theoretical computer science knowledge but I could also not gain computer science knowledge because I had not programmed enough. Even if I reached a rough understanding of how to draw a bubble sort on a whiteboard I didn't understand programming languages enough to write the comparison  statements properly from scratch  and plan for exception cases.\n\n  \nI want to start completely from scratch similar to how you would introduce computer science to a child but am not sure where to start- I even tried scratch but it seemed to be more of a game with algorithm building elements to keep a child's attention rather than an appropriate place for someone to learn about computers and computation from the ground up.  How should I move forward?\n\n",

Ideally, I would like to create a wide range of creative projects using both together. Apps, websites, games for consoles, web-based games, AR and VR experiences, and so on. Whatever I get inspired to create. So, the past month or so I've been using online and book resources to try and learn coding on my own. I started with basic HTML, CSS, and entry-level JavaScript. I haven't gone in-depth with anything just yet. Just chipping at studies an hour or so a day.\n\nI wasn't sure if JavaScript would be the best investment as my first coding language for my creative goals. I've been dipping my toes in C# this last week after learning about the recent innovations to C# that covers all the areas I'm interested in listed above. However, I hit a wall trying to setup and implement Visual Studio Code.\n\nWith JavaScript, I could just make a js file in any text-based editor, even notepad, and just go. But C# it feels like I need all these add-ons, libraries, plugins and more just to START learning what I can do besides Console.WriteLine(). I feel like I'm being sold dependency on one specific program than learning a language.

In the program, it seems that it can't read it, or something, because everything except for case, the text and break don't have their colours. And when I put the cursor there, it says that I need to put a String or a println with String, but in the class I'm following it's nothing like that. And, when I tried rewritting, it didn't work.\n\n\nI tried making a new Class and wrote Sysout... without anything and it works, but when I write it pasting the Switch I made (outside or inside the Switch cases), the others won't change and the one I did prior to paste it, have their colours. It's super strange. A friend told me that it was probably a problem with the syntax of my lines, but I write Sysout using Ctrl+Space (to save time), so, it can't be a syntax problem.\n\n\nI'll try to write everything in advance so I can continue the class, but I want to know the real solution to this strange error, if it exists...\n\n                \n\n",

I have a dependancy upon these tools which i now find constrain my ability to write fresh code. \n\nAm i doing something wrong in programming? Ive been at this on and off for the past 3/4 years and i just cannot retain specific functions and libraries languages need to make some programs, and it makes me feel useless as a programmer. How could i transition from where i am currently to progress further.\n\nI have never touched programming books or any biographies, i have only previously tried to get inspiration from others code, developing off examples on libraries and writing stuff, getting to a point where i am stuck and reverting to AI, baffling my flow and resulting in lacks of motivation where i am supposed to be in control of software im writing, but it takes over and becomes another sequence of hoops i need to jump through to even get anywhere.\n\nAny feedback towards my situation would help me so much, im looking forward to spending an extended period over the summer to try to become the best i can be, an end goal trying to create a product with some revenue so i can fund a community project that ive wanted to do for a while. \n\nThanks for reading",

I thought, \"Maybe I should learn code before anything else, get ahead, and make some time for math when I'm actually in uni. My 11th-grade Pre-cal teacher recommended learning code first even.\" There weren't many free online structured courses for learning Python that had hands-on practice but I did find Kaggle.\n\n  \nI completed the short \"Intro to Programming\" course on there with relative ease. Some exercises were mildly tricky but I was able to get through them with minimal hints and criticism from ChatGPT. After that, I headed onto the main Python course. This was also relatively easy in the first few topics but when it got to lists, list comprehension, dictionaries, for loops and stuff, the exercises became increasingly difficult. The reading part before the exercises page weren't the hardest to understand and I even tried my best to truly understand the content. I would try a code first, see if it's correct, if it isn't, I send it to ChatGPT to see what's wrong with it without providing a hint to the solution, and try again. I'd even uncomment the \"q.solution()\" to see the solution when I'd given up after hours of head banging, trying to figure this out. I'd check out the solution, read through it line by line to see what the hell it's even doing and how it makes sense, not get it, send it to ChatGPT to explain it in practice, still get confused, explain bit by bit, go back, solve the same problem, move on to the next problem, and struggle with even getting *started*. I've been *especially* stuck on the \"Exercise: Strings and Dictionaries\" on problems 2 and 3. holy hell\n\n  \nI can not even think of what to start with, I can not brainstorm. I've heard the advice \"just code dumb stuff that pertains to the problem, fix it, expand it, and slowly work towards the solution\" but I feel like I can't even code dumb stuff either.\n\n  \nI thought maybe Kaggle goes to quick with questions that go from simple syntaxes, to abstractions of those syntaxes, and then abstractions UPON abstractions on those syntaxes that just overload my working memory. \n\n  \n**Is Kaggle actually the problem?

However, I made a similar weather api project 2 years ago when I first started learning to code with SheCodes- a beginners course. Over the past two years I‚Äôve done further Python courses, and a software engineering bootcamp with CodeFirstGirls where we went over JavaScript, Python and MySQL.  Right now I‚Äôm a web designer for a law company - we can both use html bootstrap css, so nothing technical. I do enjoy front end so these qualities aren‚Äôt pointless to write on my cv, but I‚Äôve been here for 13 months but I‚Äôm not challenge enough.  I feel like I‚Äôve gone backwards. Even this weather app seemed a bit difficult. The reason I say self sabotage is because I went back to JavaScript, something I began learning years ago. I felt like I didn‚Äôt know it enough so I went right back to the beginning rather than going onto react which I now feel like I should have. I never know how much JavaScript I should know before I move on. \n\nAlso another thing that gets to me, is during my bootcamp, the instructors encouraged us to use ChatGPT. They said in their jobs they use it everyday and the skill is know what it ask and where to add this in your code, so some times I use ChatGPT but maybe more than I should. \n\nIs this normal? \n\nI‚Äôm also 26 in 5 months, and I‚Äôm on 31k right now. I honestly expected to be doing better and I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being dramatic or impatient. ",

I am not necessarily a stranger to graphics, as I worked alongside the LearnOpenGL book and finished most of it up to the section on PBR.  However, I am not sure if my approach to that book was the best and it ended up taking me a really long time to internalize the concepts, and even at that, now I wouldn't even know simple things like more advanced yet standard lighting techniques.  \n\nTo prevent wasting a lot of time and actually learn better, I was wondering what is the best way to read a programming/CS book/textbook?  I am at the moment reading the Raytracing in a weekend series (going to read all 3 books), and then I would like to read the PBRT book.  I noticed that there is a lot of given code and concepts in raytracing in a weekend, as well as PBRT, and I am wondering if I should just read it, or if I should be programming alongside it.  Or maybe I should read it first and then try to apply it? but then by then I have forgotten everything.\n\nI dont know but any help I very much appreciate.

I've discovered that if I don't use `.escape()` and just display the content in the view either with the `.textContent` DOM method or with a templating engine like ejs, it will display the proper text content on the page and literally display any `<script>` or other html tags instead of running the code inside of them. However, is there still a risk of an attacker manipulating the code on the back-end if I don't escape the input?\n\nFinally, I know I should use parameterization for Postgresql queries.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm starting my MCA this year. Before this, I completed a BSc (non-CS), so I have no formal background in programming. My ultimate goal is to get into the AI/ML field, and I‚Äôll have 3 years during MCA to build my skills.\n\nI‚Äôve been researching roadmaps, and most of them recommend Python and strong math foundations‚Äîwhich actually works well for me since I studied a lot of math in depth during my BSc. So I started learning Python and brushing up on math side by side.\n\nI also spoke to my cousin who works at Boeing as a full-stack developer. He told me that full-stack/frontend/backend roles are getting saturated, and if I'm starting fresh, AI/ML is a better long-term direction. That motivated me even more to stick to this field.\n\nHowever, a friend of mine told me that companies don't just want Python developers. He said that languages like C++ and Java are often preferred too, and since Python is more \"readymade,\" it might not be enough alone. He suggested learning C++ or Java first, then Python later‚Äîwhich has left me confused.\n\nNow I‚Äôm also wondering‚Äîshould I be open to development roles too? Like learning full-stack or backend frameworks (Django, React, etc.) along with Python and AI/ML stuff? Or should I just stay focused on AI/ML and not try to juggle too many things at once?\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation‚Äîcoming from a non-CS background and aiming for AI/ML? I'd really appreciate any guidance, suggestions, or roadmaps.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I think for the startup I‚Äôve been working on, there‚Äôs definitely been moments where I feel like we‚Äôre going really fast but eventually end up in a point where we need to think of real engineering solutions (particularly in case of software startup) and get stuck. It‚Äôs good for the early stages when you need to validate an idea or get something out there but you do eventually hit a wall and need to actually start thinking rather than relying on AI.\n\nVibe coding doesn‚Äôt create solutions that scale and exponentially increases technical debt if you‚Äôre putting no thought into what‚Äôs being engineered. Over the past few months, I‚Äôve seen some terrible code written with single / long files and no kind of abstraction and modularization done in many cases. This makes it hard to actually build on top of what‚Äôs already written and certainly doesn‚Äôt scale. \n\nI think AI is pretty far away from replacing real engineers. ",

The only thing is that the majority of my job will be using COBOL/JCL and the more I learn about the language the less I like. I'm also not wanting to get trapped in a hole where the only jobs I'm qualified for are legacy systems or ones using COBOL. Tbf they said that they were trying to migrate off of it, but it will most likely take a long time before that can happen.\n\nI'm having trouble figuring out if I should keep applying to other jobs while I work this one or not look a gift horse in the mouth. I would feel guilty about leaving say a month after they finally train me as I told them that I had no prior COBOL experience and are willing to train me. Can anyone else give me advice about whether this experience will carry over to a new job or if I should just keep applying and leave whenever I get a new offer.\n\n  \nUpdate: I took the job! Thanks so much for the replies, It's helped me see the job in a new light. A lot of you guys had some good points, especially about keeping a COBOL consulting job in my back pocket in case I need to fall back on it. Luckily I like the company and I'm really grateful that they gave me a shot even though my experience isn't in COBOL. I'm excited to start with them and like other people were saying, maybe I can get my hands in modernizing or working on some of their other projects while I'm there. \n\nAlso to the people who saw this and were like duhh take it, I have some things that would make me very marketable to the field I'm interested in and got myself a couple of interviews for those companies, but there just aren't jobs for it in my state and I was weighing whether I can stay here and gain experience while being close to my family and do that in a couple years, or I should just leave now and try for that even if I have to move a little farther than I would like.

There were large gaps between all those contracts.\n\nAs for my educational background, I have a bachelor's degree with a math major and minors in physics and computer science, and a post-graduate certification in data science.\n\nMy issue is this: I see generative AI as contributing to the ruination of society, and I do not want any involvement in that. The problem is that the entirety of the tech industry is moving toward generative AI, and it seems like if you don't have AI skills, then you will be left behind and will never be able to find a job in the CS field. Am I correct in saying this?\n\nAs far as my disgust for the tech industry as a whole: It's not just AI that makes me feel this way, but all the shit the industry has been up to since long before the generative AI boom. The big tech CEOs have always been scumbags, but perhaps the straw that broke the camel's back was when they pretty much all bent the knee to a world leader who, in additional to all the other shit he has done and just being an overall terrible person, has multiple times threatened to annex my country.\n\nIs there any hope of me getting a decent CS career, while making minimal use of generative AI, and making no actual contribution to the development of generative AI (e.g. creating, training, or testing LLMs)? Or should I abandon the field entirely? (If the latter, then the question of what to do from there is probably beyond the scope of this subreddit and will have to be asked somewhere else.)",

My journey started at a FANG company where I spend around 2.5 years, and for the past year, I've been working in a startup.  \nJoining FANG was a dream come true, after working hard in college. But over time, I started getting feedback that I was too slow. Eventually, I was put on PIP (and failed). It was tough pill to swallow since I had always assumed that as long as I delivered work, that would be enough. Apparently, speed matters as well.\n\nPost that chapter, I joined a startup. But, few months in here, I'm getting the same feedback. Management is again raising concerns about my speed and deliverables.\n\nIt's a bit frustrating, since I do put in the hours. A typical day is like 7-8 hours, with 3-4 hours of focused work. But, when things get heated to meet deadlines, I find myself pushing the hours to 13+ hour days for stretches, to keep up.\n\nI'll admit I'm introvert by nature. I don't engage a lot in casual conversations, but I try to communicate clearly about anything related to my work. I document my designs, processes, task breakdowns etc - Anything that might clear things for the management, or, might help others for future reference.\n\nAnd, still I find myself tagged as a \"slow developer\". It's very hard and honestly, I'm not sure how to improve from here. This breaks down my workplace confidence completely.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation, how did you overcome it? What would you suggest to improve if you were in my shoes? And, are there alternative career paths I can explore?\n\nEdit - Since some people asked about situation based examples:\n\n\\- I was assigned a deliverable, which took me about 9 months (as single developer on the project). About 4 months went into testing, which wasn't even on me since the testing process was completely ad-hoc. Looking back, I could have communicated a bit better, but it would still take me about \\~3 months for that project.\n\n\\- In my current startup, since the last 5 months, I'm working on a totally different aspect than what my team's functional domain is. This required me to understand a ton of things to enable myself to start delivering. Also, since there is shortage of documentations, I mostly had to rely on people & codebases to get the understandings. This took me significant time, and was labelled as slow. Not sure what could have been done differently.",

It was a fully remote job (this was before covid when remote jobs weren't even that common), I got hired at a mid-sized company and my job was to maintain several very old java applications. Most of the team was non-technical, there were a few other devs on the team but they worked on other stuff, I was the only one working on these java applications so no one really knew what I was doing, as long as the applications worked they were happy. I quickly realized my boss knew very little about development. I would do about 1-2 hrs of work each day then spend the rest of the day doing nothing, and my boss was still impressed and gave me great performance reviews. After 2 years I found another job because I was underpaid and honestly I was bored. My current job has the opposite problem, I work pretty hard and often even work more than 8 hours a day just to keep up with the other devs. The pay is a lot better but it's kind of stressful. I am starting to wish I stayed at the other job even though I made less money. Or I wish I could find a middle ground where the work is challenging enough so I am not bored, but not stressed either.\n\nI am curious how hard you work, is there anyone here who does nothing or almost nothing?",

        "content": "Edit: I can't edit the title, but I want to be specific. I don't mean the bubble will pop as in Gen AI will go away. Gen AI is never going away. I mean the bubble around creating chat applications or other Gen AI applications that are just wrappers around models from the big 4-5 companies. \n\nI want to get some opinions from people who know this field. People who work in the trenches every day. \n\nI work at a small company (or I did, I'm in the process of being laid off). They do contracts for small companies, and some sub contracting for the government. My Ceo, my CTO, and the head of software engineering are all obsessed with Gen AI, agentic frameworks. They are having us build internal tools to create our own chatbot, that they want to market out to other companies and sell. \n\nThe other day, we were working on a translation \"tool\" within the mcp architecture. One of our senior devops guys, who is very smart and great at the job, asked point blank \"why would a company want this service can't they just ask chatgpt to translate the document?\" The answer, right now, is that chatgpt is a black box. You don't really have any concept of auditibility, how long it actually took to translate the document, what it cost, how accurate it is, etc, just using chatgpt. \n\nWhen you use tools like Langchain and Langfuse with an LLM engine you can track these things. Today, this is useful and I understand the business argument for doing it. \n\nBut to me it feels like a giant bubble waiting to pop. All we are doing, and anyone else claiming to have a chatbot or agentic system, is putting a wrapper on llms developed by the big 4-5 companies. This seems unsustainable to me as a business model. Let's say tomorrow, Anthropic comes out and says now we have an agentic tool that works directly with Claude models, it's configured to work with them out of the box, and it includes full tracing and auditibility of everything you do. And then 2 months later, Open AI releases their competing tool. \n\nWhy then would anyone use a bunch of cobbled together 3rd party tools to accomplish the same thing, instead of just signing deals with one of those companies? \n\nI feel that once that happens, and I am positive it will happen, the whole ecosystem around agentic applications/MCP/chat applications will collapse. Does this sound crazy to everyone? I'd love to hear some opinions. ",

        "content": "I applied to Apple about a month ago for an LLVM GPU Compiler Engineer position. For context, I currently work at Intel as an LLVM Compiler Engineer (3yrs here, 7yrs total experience), working almost exclusively on the optimizing middle-end. Plenty of CPU experience, but not much GPU experience, which I was upfront about and they were totally fine with throughout the process.\n\nOver the course of 4 weeks or so, I went through a pretty grueling hiring process (1 manager screen, 1 technical screen, 4 technical interviews + 1 behavioral interview) that mostly seemed to go well. Hiring manager seemed impressed by my personal projects and professional experience, and the interviewers all seemed like smart and capable people. At this time, I'm also in a process with Qualcomm for a CPU LLVM Engineer position and they also seem very interested (though I'm a bit skeptical of them, tbh the team seemed very demoralized and overworked). At this point, Apple said they want to move forward and we're in the offer phase.\n\nI just had a conversation with the recruiter this morning just checking the team was something I was interested in and starting the conversation about salary expectations. I told him I like the team and I'm very interested in what Apple has to offer. However, when I told him I'm expecting something in the base pay range of $200k - $250k he seemed very shocked. He used the phrase \"strongly misaligned\" on salary expectations. I told him the truth: I'm currently making close to the middle of that range at Intel, plus stock and bonuses (about another $20-40k). I panicked a little when I heard that, so I backpedaled a bit and told him that compensation wasn't necessarily the most important factor and hopefully it wouldn't be an impediment to them making an offer. He said he'll need to talk to the senior hiring manager and get back to me.\n\nI have another call scheduled with him tomorrow to talk again, but I'm worried I screwed up. The online posting says the base pay range is between $175,800 and $312,200, so I don't think I highballed them or made a ridiculous offer. I understand experience may be a mitigating factor, but I'm still really worried. Intel has been doing really poorly since I started working here, and while I like the work overall and have a good relation with my manager, working with my team can be pretty exhausting, and the layoffs have taken a heavy toll. All in all, I'm ready to get out.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks if you've read this far.",

I work for a company that rhymes with Bamazon. \n\nMy relationship with my manager has always been rocky - he has a non-technical background and is currently only an L5. I've spoken to my Sr. SDE and others for advice - they have also had issues with him prior, being very assertive and not taking differing opinions well. I will admit that I can be very combative/vocal (I'm American, he's international).\n\nNevertheless, from 2024 to 2025, I was top of the team in code output and was getting ‚Äúpromo-track‚Äù feedback every 1:1. However, long story short, we've had a series of increasingly bad arguments that have broken our relationship: \n\n*  Early Jan, I pushed back on my manager‚Äôs micro-managing, and he got angry, called me into a meeting immediately\n* He's called me \"defensive\", \"lacking ownership\", and having a \"victim mentality\" for asking for examples for growth areas during end-of-year reviews\n* I started documenting 1:1s with emails, and he said it felt overly formal and asked me to stop\n* He prevented me from mentoring an intern because he \"didn't trust me\" after I told him not to micromanage me again in April\n\nI escalated to my skip last week because it was affecting my mental health. During my meeting with my skip, he even said (verbatim), \"Your manager has a very, very big ego and is hard to work with, it's not just you\". My skip just had a meeting with me today and said that all the managers (my manager, him, and their manager) met and discussed allowing me to transfer to a sister team, effective immediately, as a change of scenery and environment.\n\nI desperately need help as to what to do here. I'm just very burnt out from the situation and want to leave. I feel like I failed somehow and want to quit. \n\nHere are my options:\n\n1. Transfer under sister team now (new tech stack, new manager)\n1. Stay, wait for focus + pivot, trigger FMLA \n1. Stay, invoke FMLA ASAP for mental health\n\nI'm really just done with this company and want to go for option 3. All thoughts appreciated, feeling boxed in.",

        "author": "popeyechiken",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I have been a software engineer for 13 years now. I've been web frontend focused since 2019 since I took a liking to it at the end of my first job. Anyway, my career has had its ups and downs, but it feels way way down right now.\n\nMy career was going pretty well until I got laid off in March, 2023. Since then I have had two jobs, and both ended poorly. I am currently unemployed yet again, but unlike previous job searches, I am not feeling hopeful this time.\n\nOne of my last two jobs ended with being fired and my previous one ended with resignation. Both lasted less than 1 year. I felt productive at both jobs, and I made an effort to help less experienced devs. However, after a while, I would inevitably clash with leadership and not behave that well, and the reasons were different at the two companies.\n\nAt one, I felt overly constrained by controlling product managers and wasn't able to make any code change that was not ticketed, since every single PR needed manual QA before being merged into prod. I felt that the React code was the worst I'd ever seen, such as ~25 components that were 1000+ lines long. One component had an ENORMOUS switch statement for conditional rendering that I badly wanted to refactor, but it wasn't a business priority. I also wanted to introduce tests since there weren't any at all, but it wasn't a business priority. Anyway, after trying to take initiative on these things and being blocked, I handled things without much tact, empathy, or whatever else is necessary to maintain good relations with people. Eventually I was fired.\n\nThe most recent job I thought was going to be better. It took me 7.5 months to get it and I liked the industry it was in and the novelty of the service they offered. The code was better than at the other company, and there was more room to make code changes I felt were important to make (after making a Jira ticket myself first). About midway through I got to greenfield a frontend for an internal software overhaul, and it was pretty cool honestly. But then the head of engineering was fired and never replaced, and another engineer that I got to know somewhat was fired without backfill. At one point I was split between a new modern website the company was building and the greenfield internal project, which signaled that I was valuable, but I also couldn't handle it. We had only two frontend devs, myself and a more junior person, working on two huge projects, both rewrites meant to modernize software that had been tried and true for 15+ years.\n\nI was in a good position on the one hand, but on the other I just got burned out. Both projects had unrealistic deadlines given our dev resources. Engineering leadership felt non-existent since the fired head was never replaced. I couldn't balance the responsibilities with the rest of my life, which includes daughters aged 1 and 3.\n\nThen, since I was so frustrated by what was happening, I told the Owner/Founder of the company, who also wrote most of the original code, that we weren't going to hit the deadline, plus some other thoughts. He actually was open to what I was saying and he ended up convening a 2 hour meeting where we changed course with the internal project, and he thanked me for speaking up. I should have felt good about this, but everyone else on the project looked upset with me. At some point, it became clear to me they didn't approve of what I did for some reason, and they wouldn't tell me why, or in some cases talk to me at all. This became an unbearable situation for me and I ended up resigning.\n\nThroughout these two experiences, I had a lot of negative thoughts and kind of vented at people more than is helpful. Looking back, my intentions and my technical performance seem fine, but I just went about it all in a disruptive and heavy-handed way. I wanted to bring about change, but I didn't want to be patient in the process, and I assumed ill intent by others when it probably could have been explained by incompetence, ignorance, or simply an unfortunate set of circumstances.\n\nNow I'm in this all too familiar position of lacking employment. AI is ravaging all except senior+ positions, and my two shots at senior responsibilities did not go well on the whole. I can probably get there, but it would take more time than I have to invest, realistically. The amount of coaching, therapy, preparation, and practice I'd need to land a job, and more importantly to succeed in it, feels overwhelming. We don't have much help with the kids, and daycare is WAY too expensive.\n\nWhat's the path now? It's not like it once was where the only huge hurdle was passing an interview. I've failed at two roles now, even if I feel there were positive aspects. I've replayed the reasons for these outcomes dozens of times in my head, and the positive things too, but the poor end results remain.",

        "author": "happylogicgate",

Note all numbers below are in US dollars, not Canadian dollars.\n\n**Offer 1:**\n\n* Role: New Grad SWE @ Big Tech in USA\n* Compensation: 240K TC (180K base + 60K in RSUs)\n* Location: Bay Area, fully in-person\n* Pros:\n   * Getting a big company name on my resume is good for career growth\n   * I work on large-scale distributed systems, using Rust and Golang, which is really cool\n* Cons:\n   * Higher cost of living than Canada (food + rent)\n   * It's fully in-person in the Bay Area, so I'll be away from family and friends in Canada\n   * Below average work-life balance (it's common to work until 6pm)\n   * I have to be part of an on-call rotation, and it's fairly common to get multiple alerts everyday\n   * RSUs are at a high valuation, and will only increase in value if AI continues to rapidly get better\n   * RSUs are not liquid since it's a private company\n\n**Offer 2:**\n\n* Role: Tech Lead @ Tiny Startup in Canada\n* Compensation: 240K TC (240K base + no equity)\n* Location: Canada, fully remote\n* Pros:\n   * I can live at home in Canada, free rent and healthy food (if I move out to live on my own, cost of living is cheaper)\n   * Better work-life balance, since work is remote and on-call only happens during big feature releases a few times a year\n* Cons:\n   * Company is tiny, so only person above me is the CEO, so there's very little room for long-term growth / pay raises\n   * Company is not well-known, making it harder to switch to a higher paying job in the future\n   * I work on same (good, but kinda boring) TypeScript tech stack I've been working on for years, so less career growth\n\nI'm tempted to choose the easier, less risky option of the Canadian startup.\n\nThe compensation is what I expected to be making near the end of my career, not the beginning, so maybe I shouldn't worry about career growth as much? In Canada, 240K USD is a crazy amount, especially for a New Grad - it's about about how much Google & Apple pays for senior engineers.\n\n**Which offer should I choose?** I'd love to hear all of your opinions. Especially if you're a Canadian who has worked in the US before (and either stayed or come back to Canada after a few years).\n\n\\---\n\n**Edit:** Someone in the comments said that my usage of big tech was too broad. To clarify, the company I was referring to is one of the leading LLM model companies in the US. There's very few, so take your guess.\n\n**Edit 2:** I'm obviously just gonna put \"Software Engineer\" on my resume if I accept the Canadian company offer, not \"Tech Lead\". I'm 100% not claiming I'm anywhere near as experienced as a senior software engineer. This is just the title the company gives me, which is why I put it in the post.\n\n**Edit 3:** The startup is more stable than the US company because they've existed for a decade without firing/laying off a single person. I guess they're more of a small business than a startup since they've been around for awhile.",

I want to quit and go travel, but when I consider it, I get very scared of what my life will be like once I'm done travelling. I will be out a year of experience and savings, possibly with an even tighter job market than we have right now.

Why should they program in natural languages over the programming languages they are already productive in? It, also, causes learning loss in new programmers like handing a calculator to a kid learning arithmetic.\n\nIf you are selling the ability to program in natural language to non-programmers, you need a much more mature product that generates and maintains production-grade code because non-programmers don‚Äôt understand architecture or how to maintain or debug code.\n\nIf you are selling the ability to automate repetitive tasks, how is GenAI superior to a vast amount of tooling already on the market?\n\nThe only application that makes sense to me is a ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù that does tasks you are not proficient at - generating test cases for programmers, explaining code etc. But, then, it has limits in how good it is.\n\nIt appears companies have decided to buy into a product that is not fully mature and can get in the way of getting work done.

        "content": "I waited a while before making this post because it didn't feel real at first, and felt like it could all be taken away. But it's been a short while so maybe I feel okay sharing now. Hope I don't jinx it.\n\nI was laid off in October of 2024 from a small consulting company. The company had been contracted at a \\[big tech company\\] for my first year there, and then work dried up so I ended up doing something else for the company. Though, \\[big tech company\\] legally requires that as a contractor, when describing work experience, you're not allowed to say you work for \\[big tech company\\]... you have to point out you are contracted by another company, at \\[big tech company\\]. \n\nIn other words, my work experience leading up to my job hunt was:\n\n* \\[big tech company\\], contracted by \\[consulting company \\] (1 year)\n* \\[consulting company\\] (1 year)\n\nI have severe imposter syndrome, get stuck on Leetcode mediums, feel like I don't possess anything that really makes me special. I've **never** interviewed for a big company before, as I never imagined I could even qualify through technical screenings. I didn't do much job interview research either, other than the \"Blind 75\" lineup of Leetcode problems.\n\nI frequently see people saying doing X or being Y will ruin your chances of getting a job, but I went a step further and really made some major \"mistakes\" during my interviews. So here I was incredibly lucky that things worked out. So the point of this post is just to highlight the absurdity and randomness that can factor into your search. So just believe anything can happen, apply to anything, and be optimistic. \n\nThings I see around this sub that people say will hurt your odds, and I did ALL of them.\n\n* Two column resume layout\n* Not a \"top\" school, public (ranked 30-40)\n* Work at contracting companies\n* Told every interviewer that asked, that I was laid off\n* Late to an interview by 5 minutes\n* Less than average Leetcode skills (50 easy, 50 medium, 3 hard)\n\nBut with each failed interview, I clearly knew where I was lacking, and took home lessons that I focused on hard for the next interview. \n\nFor example, my first interview was with a FAANG company, and it was my first interview in YEARS, let alone my first interview with a big tech company. I was stuttering and stumbling over my words. The company is heavy on behavioral questions so I totally embarrassed myself. I started practicing my storytelling a lot.\n\nWith the next, a medium-sized tech company, I was really enjoying the interview and things were going well. I scheduled each round 2+ weeks away to maximize my preparation time for each one. Just before the hiring manager round, I was told that another candidate accepted an offer and they were cancelling the rest of my interviews. Lesson learned: I should be prepared before any interview is scheduled, and schedule everything at my first availability.\n\nI ended up giving interviews for 6 medium-to-large companies, and received 2 offers. One from FAANG and one from a comparable company. It took me around 7 months ‚Äì I just accepted an offer in April, and started working a month ago. Both offers were way better than anything I was making before, to the point where I felt relieved I didn't make it through the Amazon interview.\n\nI just want to remind everyone that luck is a major factor in the interview process. Good luck everyone, don't give up and remember anything can happen.\n\n",

        "author": "SheSaidTechno",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone !\n\nIn the French tech industry ‚Äî especially in software engineering ‚Äî companies relies massively on external contractors through infamous service companies called ESNs (between us, we call these companies \"les marchands de viande\" (translation : 'meat dealers')). But does this model exist to the same extent in the US, Canada, UK, Australia..., or do companies there prefer a more direct approach to hiring ?\n\n**Here‚Äôs how it typically works in France, and why it feels problematic :**\n\n* **Heavy use of ESNs (consulting companies)** : Most engineers work on long-term projects (sometimes several years) for client companies, but are officially employees of a consulting company\n* **Claimed flexibility** : Companies say it‚Äôs easier to end a contractor‚Äôs mission but the same is true for permanent employees on a trial period\n* **Supposed lighter HR workload** : In theory, ESNs handle hiring, but the client still interviews and evaluates candidates themselves\n* **\"Temporary\" reinforcement :** Most missions last so long that consultants become de facto internal staff but without the benefits or recognition\n\nIn reality, the drawbacks are significant :\n\n* **More expensive** over time than hiring internal staff\n* **Little to no training** from ESNs : consultants have to upskill on their own\n* **High job insecurity** : consultants can be removed or relocated with very little notice\n* **A general lack of respect** : Many ESNs treat software engineers like interchangeable resources rather than skilled professionals. Since a business developer gets a 2000‚Ç¨ bonus each time he places a consultant on a project, some business developers may not give a fuck whether the mission matches the consultant‚Äôs skills or career goals or if the project is far from the consultant's home. And if the mission fails put all the blame on the consultant. Btw, since ESN have to pay compensations to fire an employee, their \"secret\" technique to get rid of an someone is to repeatedly relocate consultants across the country to uninteresting projects, hoping the employee will eventually resign on their own. But I won't elaborate on all the bad practices of ESNs in this post, because I could write a whole book on this subject.\n* **And definitely the worst of all : LOWER SALARIES** compared to internal employees with similar skills. Half the money the consultant earns goes to the ESN.\n\nThis system creates a kind of vicious circle :\n\nlow pay ‚Äî> less savings ‚Äî> more pressure to accept poor conditions ‚Äî> repeat\n\nAt the end, I don‚Äôt see who actually wins here aside from the ESN profiting from both sides.\n\n**The English-speaking countries model (as I understand it)**\n\n* Companies hire engineers as full-time employees, even for short-term needs ‚Äî it's the 'hire quick, fire quick' approach\n* There's less protection, but also more autonomy and transparency\n* Workers can earn higher salaries because there‚Äôs no intermediary between them and the employer\n\nTo me, this seems healthier even if it‚Äôs more unstable.\n\nBut maybe it's just an impression, so I‚Äôd really like to know : Is this accurate ?\n\n**To sum up, my questions for engineers in English-speaking countries :**\n\n1. Do companies rely heavily on contractors, or is direct hiring the norm ?\n2. Are there equivalents to the French-style ESN system ?\n3. Does the ‚Äúhire quick, fire quick‚Äù approach actually make the work more efficient ?\n\nI‚Äôm asking all this out of curiosity and a bit of frustration. This is quite a hot topic in France. Here, the current system seems to serve the interests of consulting firms more than the people actually doing the work.  \nSo I wonder : is the ‚ÄúAnglo-American‚Äù model actually better, or does it simply have different drawbacks ?  \nBecause honestly, if the French model turns out to be significantly worse for building a career, I'm seriously considering moving abroad to have a decent quality of life.\n\nLooking forward to reading your perspectives.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I started a new one at a company that I heard amazing things about, how everyone was great and how leaders were super supportive, I was genuinely excited.\n\nI started in January, onboarding was a bit messy but eventually I figured it out, I had my first oficial feedback session on 09.04, all positive, a few things to improve but the official document statement said that I was on track to complete my 6 months probation. Ever since that feedback I didn‚Äôt have any other official feedback, my manager and I talked about projects, I worked on improving what I had to improve, all our conversations were positive. There was going to be a offsite next week - well this is still happening, but I‚Äôm won‚Äôt be there - where my manager were telling me things and activities for the team. She doesn‚Äôt live at the same city that I do, so Tuesday (10.06) was the first time we‚Äôve met in person, we talked about the offsite, she was very friendly and then, Wednesday, on our regular 1:1, not even like a separate meeting, she says that I did not completed it the requirements and therefore I was no longer at the company. I asked for examples of what was wrong, she didn‚Äôt tell me, I asked why she didn‚Äôt say it before, she had 02 months to provide more feedback saying what was not working and helping me in what I needed, I mean, is her job too, she invested time, money and energy to hire and train me but ,she didn‚Äôt say anything either. It was a stab in my back,  it is astonishing how someone can be so cold. I honestly have no idea, I‚Äôm reliving all my steps and I can‚Äôt find something or a little somethings that led to this. I even thought that it could have been homophobia, I‚Äôm bi and since this is pride month, when we met I was wearing some pride apparel, but I think this is a stretch.\n\nNow I‚Äôm here, on my CV there is a 10 month job and now a 5 months job and I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll never find a place again cause who would hire someone like this? I am really lost, do HR really care so much if you look like a job hopper?\n\nFor context I have a little over 10 years experience in performance marketing/tech and jobs where I stayed almost 4 years but still, this looks so bad. I‚Äôm also in Germany if that makes any difference ",

Then I used that software experience to pivot into the SWE role I am at now.\n\nThe team I work on owns the embedded cryptographic subsystem that my company produces and is growing at a huge rate. Because of this, any real development tasks are left up to the few SMEs on the team that are stretched so thin that they have very little time to bring up new hires on the team to speed. \n\nThe actual code base is not poorly done, but it is very complicated and lots of decisions are not immediately apparent but instead are buried in hundred page long design documents hidden away in an SVN repo. Funding continuously switches on projects so that I don't get to spend more than a couple weeks on a task, before having to switch. It's been a year on the team at this point and I haven't created a single thing that I can point at and be proud of. I probably wrote more code doing a weekend hackathon than I have in the whole year I have spent as an engineer on the team. \n\nIt seems like the only real value this job has brought to my resume is the title, and the security clearance that came with it. I had an interview with Anduril early in my job for a spot on their crypto team, the hiring manager really liked me but they didn't think I had enough experience at that point to hire me as a crypto SWE. They wanted to make a dev ops role for me instead but couldn't find the funding internally. \n\nI can spare about one-two hours of my day to work on self-development, what should I be doing to best use that time to find a better SWE job, hopefully remote. \n\n",

While I know I'll be spammed with '400 isnt nearly enough' I still want to do what I can to improve my odds, of course I am still applying and will continue to till I get something.\n\nI have heard its better to look in the US. I was already considering this due to having a lot of family in NY and was applying from linkedIn to both Canada and NYC. I know to check the 'authorized to work here' as yes and to check 'sponsorship needed' as no (then later explain that you're a Canadian and a TN visa is far easier) but despite that I've only gotten 1 response from the US. \n\nI'm sure my resume isn't perfect, but I've had some Sr engineers that I've gotten to know over the years as well as a recruiter I know well look it over and say its quite good for a new grad especially the 2 years of industry experience so I don't think its holding me back.\n\nI've heard someone mention to apply to US from LinkedIn you need to buy a US phone number or you get filtered instantly. Furthermore I've noticed of course my LinkedIn profile has my location as within Canada, I figure I'd have to change this too but currently I'm applying everywhere in Canada and in NY and I worry doing that will then blacklist me from Canadian roles and I just don't know if that's a good idea? I also worry that maybe thats just uneeded steps and has nothing to do with why I'm hearing nothing from the US applications.\n\nAny advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated. While I would love to be picky with a job the reality is I'm graduating in a few days and I need income asap to support myself and start my career, at this point I just want to break into the industry idc where or the salary I just need to get my foot in the door.",

        "content": "I got my first dev job after college by basically just saying I had taken a few classes on LLVM. I spent my time there working on an AI compiler stack (Torch-MLIR) doing relatively menial things like implementing ops and fixing packaging issues. After 2 years with the company, it got bought by AMD. The team's focus shifted away from the flagship product and into more internal things, leaving me as one of the few people working on it. Since there wasn't much development happening, I worked mostly on GUI and even less on compilation. Then, after a year at AMD, I got laid off. I haven't been able to find work in almost 8 months now.\n\nThere were a number of reasons for my layoff, I think. I was one of the only people on the team without a Master's degree. I've been having ADHD issues that caused my performance to drop for a month or two before the layoff. But more importantly, I don't think I had the skills to keep up with the trajectory of the team. Everyone was moving off of supporting models on hardware and onto optimization and other such stuff internal to AMD. And as I've gotten out into the field again, a field that's changed a lot since 2021, I find that I'm lacking basically everything I'd need to get another compiler job.\n\nI don't have a Master's, I don't have any optimization knowledge. My expertise is PyTorch, Torch-MLIR, and IREE. PyTorch knowledge is useful, but only insofar as it applies to building models. Torch-MLIR and IREE seem to just not be used by anyone but my former company, and now no one at all. Hell, AMD's even hiring for my old position. I've applied and been denied multiple times.\n\nI really like compilers, but if there's no future in this for me I'll switch to doing something else. Can anyone give me some advice on this? I've tried asking my old coworkers for career advice but none of them have responded, and I'm starting to get desperate.\n\n[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/cHA7eV9.jpeg) my resume.",

The thing is: patching and making a small change here in there is required, just so I can then easily analyze the results and the whole flow can actually run without problems.\nAlso, the testing results need to be noted down manually...\n\nIn some cases I had opened at least five different VS Code instances opened, each with multiple files opened st once. I am not counting the browsers and other apps.\n\nI find this extremely exhausting and tiresome to even test one feature since everything needs to be in sync. This really makes me lose my sanity with each flow I run, show to the general public at work, but then I actually need to correct my findings since I noticed a bug in one of the patches in one of the repos. I don't think if I should waste so much time with running that testing flow, where it is mostly expeced of me to create new features and fixes, not to struggle to manage mentally my attention between that many windows.\n\nIn most of my career, or even in my free time programming - I mostly end up working comfortably and window-exhaustion never gets me. This current job I have pays extremely well, but chaos in the work organization is scary.\n\nAm I just bad with multitasking and juggling between repos? Is this normal? I don't have a comparison and I really don't know how to deal with it, can anybody relate or suggest what is wrong here, and how can I help myself?",

        "content": "Hello  \nI am IT consultant specializing in data engineering. In this topic, I would like to know what effective communication or soft skillsmeans to you, how to practice it and how to present it. \n\n\n\nDuring each half or full year evaluation, my direct manager comes to me with feedback on what the client(s) and other colleagues (usually senior managers) have said about me - it is always along these lines: technically exceptional but should work on communication. I tried to ask what does it mean but got only vague answers.\n\nOn my part, I am always nice and open to other people - at least thats what I think of myself, but sometimes I have to draw a thick line when, for example: someone entrusts me with a task that goes beyond my competence or scope of duties - think of setting up infrastructure, when its managed by client infra team and I got no permissions. Of course, I do not say \"no\" leaving the person alone with the problem, I suggest who can help and how to do it, sometimes I even engage people to help. \n\n\n\nI have the impression that any objection, which is not really an objection, and I really cannot do certain things myself, is perceived as my flaw. Of course, it doesn't work the other way around - sometimes people, like the product owner from the client's side, doesn't speak kindly to me, or uses micromanagement but it's fine, no one pays attention to it, arguing \"it is what it is, he was probably nervous\". If the situation were reversed, I would probably be removed from the project. Often, even despite previous suggestions that something might go wrong, my opinion is ignored until the thing happens and then there are complaints about it. \n\n\n\nHere I come to the conclusion that communication is simply taking everything upon yourself, nodding to everything (being a yes-man) and pretending that everything is going well, even when it isn't? I don't think so, that's why I'm asking you. I would be grateful for any feedback and materials regarding soft skills and communication.",

I found computers cool when I was a kid and liked the idea of building programs that could do stuff. I am/was an average student in school and didn't create a new programming language when I was 13. I was oblivious about IT taking over the world and didn't know anything about programming until I was 17. I studied Comp Sci in an average university in my hometown and passed with average grades. I took a software dev job in a small firm with an average pay. I was suffering with a severe inferiority complex because I wasn't exceptional.\n\nI moved to Germany from India to pursue a master's degree in CS and left my job. Now I see people from all over the world doing amazing stuff. I'm sitting in a class where there are undergrads who are 18 years old, who have been coding since they were 12 (real nerds), interned at big tech or selling their own SaaS products. I'm 26 and barely know 3 programming languages. It takes me quite a lot of time to understand mathematical concepts. I'm happy that I'm now exposed to rigorous math stuff which I skimmed through in undergrad, but still I feel lagging so far behind.\n\nTo people who aren't computer nerds but have a decent career while managing other interests, how did you make it? How do you not get disappointed with yourself when people who are much younger than you are faring far ahead in their career? Is being average okay in a field where we compete with millions of people all over the world and also a looming threat of AI taking over our jobs?",

I‚Äôm a full stack software engineer at a midsize non-tech company (but still well known) with 4.5 YOE (1.5 YOE in data analysis before that, so I guess 6 YOE total). I‚Äôve been cold applying for remote software engineering roles but I‚Äôm not really getting any bites. I know the remote market is insanely competitive right now, but I‚Äôd really like one and I‚Äôm only considering switching roles if the new one is remote.\n\nFor some more background, I have an unrelated bachelors from an Ivy League school. I have a feeling that this is one of the main reasons I‚Äôm not getting much traction - I‚Äôm probably being filtered out immediately at a lot of places for not having a CS degree, especially in this market. I was getting a good chunk more interviews 2-3 years ago.\n\nLately, I‚Äôve been contemplating doing a MSCS to make up for that shortcoming. Last year, I got accepted into GT OMSCS but I decided to not attend after thinking heavily about the time commitment. It would‚Äôve taken me about 3 years and I would‚Äôve completely had to sacrifice my quality of life due to the programs rigor. I have a wife and now a baby on the way, and my wife and I are ready to expand our family even further in the short term future, so I just didn‚Äôt think it was worth the sacrifice. Plus, now it‚Äôs been a year so my offer of admission is no longer valid anyway.\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing. WGU just came out with an MSCS that I think I can get done in 6 months, if not a year. That time horizon and day-to-day commitment is a lot more palatable to be honest. Also, my employer is willing to pay for it 100%.\n\nAll that said, do you think it‚Äôs worth it for me to do the WGU MSCS so that I can meet the CS degree requirement at a lot of places/avoid getting filtered out early in the process? The way that I‚Äôm thinking about it is that I can always take it off my resume if I feel it‚Äôs causing a negative impact on my profile. What do you guys think? Would it be beneficial to my profile or make it worse? At this point, it‚Äôs either WGU MSCS or nothing - I‚Äôm just at a point in my life where I‚Äôm done with higher education otherwise and want to focus on life itself, so I‚Äôm not considering any other masters programs.\n\nI do have 3 YOE working remotely due to COVID and I‚Äôve reflected that on my resume, plus some promotions, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a track record issue.",
