        "content": "I've had a 25 year career as a software engineer and architect. Most of my concerns have revolved around the following things:\n\n- Application scalability, availability, and security.\n- Ensuring that what we were building addressed the business needs without getting lost in the weeds.\n- UX concerns like ensuring everything functioned on mobile platforms and legacy web browsers.\n- DevOps stuff: How do we quickly ship code as fast as possible to accelerate product delivery, yet still catch regression defects early and not blow up things?\n\n- Mediating organizational conflicts: Product owner wants us to go faster but infosec wants us to go slower, existing customers are complaining about latency due to legacy code but we're also losing new customers because we're losing ground to competitors due to lack of new features. \n\nI've been vaguely aware of data engineering for years but never really thought about it. If you had asked me, I probably would have said *\"Yeah, those are the guys who keep Power BI fed and running. I'm sure they've probably repurposed DevOps workflows to help with that.\"*\n\nHowever, recently a trap door opened under me as I've been trying to help deliver a different kind of product. I fell into the world of data engineering and am shocked at how foreign it actually is.\n\nData lineage, feature stores, Pandas vs Polars, Dask, genuinely saturating dozens of cores and needing half a TB of RAM (in the app dev world, hardware is rarely a legit constraint and if it is, we easily horizontally scale), having to figure out what kind of GPU we need and where to optimally use that in the pipeline vs just distributing to a bunch of CPUs, etc. Do we use PCA reduction on these SBERT embeddings or not?\n\nEven simple stuff like \"what is a 'feature'?\" took some time to wrap my head around. *\"Dude, it's a column. Why do we need a new word for that?\"*\n\nAnyhow... I never disrespected data people, I just didn't know enough about the discipline to have an opinion at all. However, I definitely have found a lot of respect for the wizards of this black art. I guess if I had to pass along any advice, it would be that I think that most of my software engineering brethren are equally ignorant about data engineering. When they wander into your lane and start stepping on your toes, try not to get too upset.",

Is DuckDB really a database? I saw multiple posts on this subreddit and elsewhere that showcased it's comparison with tools like Polars, and that people have used DuckDB for local data wrangling because of its SQL support. Point is, I wouldn't compare Postgresql to Pandas, for example, so this is confusion 1. \n2. Is it another alternative to Dataframe APIs, which is just using SQL, instead of actual code? Due to numerous comparison with Polars (again), it kinda raises a question of it's possible use in ETL/ELT (maybe integrated with dbt). In my mind Polars is comparable to Pandas, PySpark, Daft, etc, but certainly not to a tool claiming to be an RDBMS. ",

Things like GPST, engine status, temperature, etc. We’re currently pushing this data through Kafka using Kafka Connect + Debezium to land it in Snowflake.\n\nIt got us far but now we are starting to see trouble as data scales.\n\nOne. We are consistently losing or misprocessing late arriving events from edge devices in poorer connectivity zones. Even with event timestamps and buffer logic in Spark, we end up with duplicated records or gaps in aggregation windows.\n\nAnd two. Schema drift is also messing things up. Whenever the hardware team updates firmware or adds new sensor types, the structure of the incoming data changes slightly which breaks something downstream.We have tried enforcing Avro schemas via Schema Registry but it does not do that well when things evolve quickly.\n\nTo make things even worse, our Snowflake MERGE operations are starting to fizzle under load. Clustered tables help but not enough. \n\nWe are debating whether to continue building around this setup with more Spark jobs and glue code, or switch to something more managed that can handle real-time ingestion and late arrival tolerance. Would like not having to spin up a full lakehouse or manage Flink.\n\nAny thoughts or insights that can help us get out of this mess?\n\nEDIT - Fixed typo.",

So I’m considering **enrolling in a postgrad certificate or structured course**, even if it’s not the most elite one — just to have *external pressure* and deadlines. I care about building real skill, not networking or titles.\n\n# What I’m looking for:\n\n* A **practical learning path**, preferably with hands-on projects and real tech\n* Structure that helps me stay accountable\n* Deepening my skills in: Airflow (advanced), PySpark/Spark, Kafka, SQL, cloud-based pipelines, testing, CI/CD\n* Willing to invest time and money if it helps me build solid skills\n\n# Questions:\n\n* Has anyone here gone through something similar — what helped you push through the discipline barrier?\n* Any recommendations for **serious technical courses** (e.g. Udemy, DataCamp, Udacity, ProjectPro, Coursera, others)?\n* Are structured certs or postgrad programs worth it for people like me who need external accountability?\n* Would a “nanodegree” (e.g. Udacity) be overkill or the right fit?\n\nAny thoughts are welcome. Honesty is appreciated — I just want to get better and build a real career.\n\nIs it really just \"get your sh\\*t together and create a personal project\". Is it that easy for most of you guys? Do you think it's lack of something on my end?\n\n  \nEDIT: M24",

That’s how I’ve been told to run things. It works, but only just. The CPU on the VM is starting to brick it, but you know, that will only matter as soon as it breaks..\n\nI use Linux at home and I’m comfortable in the terminal. Not an expert of course but keen to take on a challenge. I want to containerise my work with Docker so I can keep things clean and consistent. It would also let me apply proper practices like versioning and CI/CD.\n\nIf I want to use Docker properly, it really needs to be running on a Linux environment. But I know that asking for anything outside Windows will probably get some pushback, we’re on prem so I doubt they’ll approve a cloud environment. I get the vibe that running code is a bit of mythical concept to the rest of the team, so explaining dockers pros and cons will be a challenge. \n\nSo is it worth trying to make the case for a Linux VM? Or do I just work around the setup I’ve got and carry on with patchy solutions? What’s the general vibe on docker/linux at other companies, it seems pretty mainstream right?\n\nI’m obviously quite new to DE, but I want to do things properly.

You can load data from PDFs, transcripts, spreadsheets, databases, integrations, etc., and pull structured tables directly from it. The output is always a table you can use downstream. You can merge it, filter it, export it, perform calculations on it, whatever.\n\nThe workflow has LLM jobs that are arranged like a waterfall, model-agnostic, and designed around structured output. So you can use one step with 4o-mini, or nano, or opus, etc. You can select any model, run your logic, chain it together, etc. Then you can export results back to Snowflake or just work with it in the GUI to build reports. You can schedule it to scrape the data sources and just run the new data sets. There is a RAG agent as well, I have a vectordb attached.\n\nIn the gui on the left is the table and on the right, there’s a chat interface. Behind the scenes, it analyzes the table you’re looking at, figures out what kinds of Python/SQL operations could apply, and suggests them. You pick one, it builds the code, runs it, and shows you the result. (Still working on getting the python/SQL thing in the GUI, getting close)\n\nWould anyone here use something like this??? The goal is let you publish the workflows to business people so they can use it themselves without dealing with prompts.\n\nAnyhow, I am really interested in what the community thinks about something like this. I'd prefer not to state what the website is etc here, just DM me if you want to play with it. Still rough on the edges.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n  \nThanks to everyone who reached out. A lot of people asked for a demo video, so I put one together. It starts with a real use case: a customer receives a weekly report that breaks down feature requests and related metrics.\n\nThis is just one example. What makes this platform different is accuracy and flexibility. There are plenty of polished tools built for product teams (and to be clear this tool is not marketed as a dedicated tool for PMs). We offer the same insights, but without the fluff. Raw data goes in, and you get structured tables or written reports out. You can push results into tools like Jira or Aha, or plug them into your own dashboards, or just query data in our interface.\n\n\n\nIt also supports broader use cases. Need to convert 1,000 PDFs that are dumped in a Google Drive each day into a Google Sheets and into S3 for purchasing managers? No problem.\n\nThe platform supports up to 1GB of data with a built-in vector store.\n\nSo at its core, it is an AI-native ETL engine built for unstructured-to-structured or vector store workflows. We are also working on a simple, center-screen chatbot that gives execs access only to what you choose to publish. Here's the youtube, follow us! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdOKeSq8E4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdOKeSq8E4k)\n\nFYI - right now this is a closed beta. We have a general waiting list. If you want to join the closed beta, let me know.",

It took what I went through, and still going through, for me to post this.**\n\n**So, Chris Garzon..., Lets talk about him a moment. This is a guy who couldn't give a sh!t about his students/clients. Unless, of course, they pay him a crazy amount of money. And, I found recently, he isnt as good as he says he is. There is so much I want to say here but it may incriminate some folks so I must digress. Just know, Chris is not a good person. He has a great face for his commercials and has a good mop of hair. On top of that, he uses some good taglines in his commercials. At first, his commercials targeted noobs like me. He made it seem like this was easy and they were here to help. What a crock of shit.**\n\n**I started learning SQL (which I found out was free). If you have a question about something you are learning, you are asked to place the question in a slack channel that is provided to you. The question sits there until someone gets around to it which is usually the next day. A lot of the time the CSM (Client Success Manager) would tell you to \"check chatgpt\" or \"Look it up on youtube\". What? Isnt that what I paid OVER $10K for? For you to assist me? Sorry to inconvenience your day. Its hard for anyone studying to come across a question or logic that is hard to understand and just need a quick answer.**  \n  \n**Calls for study would happen but the instructor didnt show a few times. They have been better about that. DEA even created a discord channel and right when people were using it, they took it away. At first they were all about \"Study Buddies\". Find yourself a partner and study with them. Great, so you do that and use the discord but then they take it away. Back to square 1. Studying on my own with no one to ask questions or anything. I felt lost.** \n\n**Then, a number of months go by and we see a new add from Chris. He was marketing different. \"You must make between $150k-$200k and have a couple years of experience OR KEEP SCROLLING\" was the new tagline. Everyone was up in arms. Some guy on the site made a post about it. He called Chris out and everything. He was pretty respectful too. I wouldn't have been. To think they scammed the new comers, me. To think that the job security they talked about is now gone and out the window. What pieces of crap!**\n\n**Then... Python starts and the instructor is insufferable. The course is horrible. Not much else to say about that other than I paid over $10k to change my career and become a data engineer and I have to go buy another course because the one I was ripped off for is absolutely terrible.** \n\n  \n**Now, not everything is bad. There have been some good teachers and mindset coaches. Payal was amazing and she got tired of the place and quit.**\n\n  \n**It would be in your best interest to look elsewhere for your education as a data engineer, even if you are experienced. Dont fall for the commercials.**\n\n**#whatdidigetmyselfinto**\n\n  \n**Me...**",

The provider automatically configures timeouts based on your DAG settings:\n\n    from telomere_provider.utils import enable_telomere_tracking\n    \n    # Your existing DAG, scheduled to run every 24 hours with a 4 hour timeout...\n    dag = DAG(\"nightly_dag\", ...)\n    \n    # Enable tracking with one line!\n    enable_telomere_tracking(dag)\n\nIt integrates with Telomere which has a free tier that covers 12+ daily DAGs. We built this because Airflow's own alerting can fail if there's an infrastructure issue, and external cron monitors miss when DAGs start but die mid-execution.\n\nCheck out the [blog post](https://modulecollective.com/posts/telomere-airflow-provider/) or go to [https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider](https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider) to check out the code.\n\nWould love feedback from folks who've struggled with Airflow monitoring!",

You can speed it up further with parallelism.  \n\\- Sling costs 3x more hardware resources for the same work compared to any of the dlt fast backends, which i found surprising given that there's not much work happening, SQL copy is mostly a data throughput problem.\n\nAll said, while I believe choosing dlt is a no-brainer for pythonic data teams (why have tool sprawl with something slower in a different tech), I appreciated the simplicity of setting up sling and some of their different approaches.",

The GitHub Actions extension feels clunky and not intuitive.\n\nOur goal is to find a setup that is:\n\nDeveloper-friendly (ideally integrated in VS Code or at least easy to trigger without manual clicking),\n\nNot overly complex (we considered building a Streamlit UI with buttons, but that’s more effort than we can afford right now),\n\nSeamless for deploying Power BI models and reports (models go via Fabric CLI, reports via deployment pipelines).\n\nI know most companies just use Azure DevOps for this — and honestly, it works great. But moving to GitHub was a business decision, so we have to make it work.\n\nHas anyone here implemented something similar using GitHub successfully?\n\nAny tips on tools, IDEs, Git integrations, or CLI-based workflows that made your life easier?\n\nThanks in advance!",

He's quite proud of this, and wants every pipeline to use Talend.\n\nMy fellow engineers have found workarounds that minimize our exposure to it, and are basically using it for orchestration only, so the boss is happy.\n\nWe finally have a new use case, which will be, as far as I can tell, the first streaming pipeline we'll have.  I'm setting up a webhook to API Gateway to S3 and want to use MSK to a processed bucket (i.e. Silver layer), and then send to Redshift. Normally I would just have a Lambda run an insert, but the boss also wants to reduce our reliance on that because ”it's too messy”.  (Also if you have recommendations for better architecture here I'm open to ideas).\n\nOf course the boss asked me to look into Talend to do the whole thing. I'm fine with using it to shift from S3 to Redshift to keep him happy, but would appreciate some examples of why not to use Talend streaming over MSK.\n\nThank you in advance r/dataengineering community!",

I was frustrated with a lot of existing metadata tools, specifically as a tool to provide to individual contributors, they were either too complicated (both to use and deploy) or didn't support the data sources I needed.\n\nI designed Marmot with the following in mind:\n\n* **Simplicity**: Easy to use UI, single binary deployment\n* **Performance**: Fast search and efficient processing\n* **Extensibility**: Document almost anything with the flexible API\n\nEven though it's early stages for the project, it has quite a few features and a growing plugin ecosystem!\n\n* Built-in query language to find assets, e.g `@metadata.owner: \"product\"` will return all assets owned and tagged by the product team\n* Support for both Pull and Push architectures. Assets can be populated using the CLI, API or Terraform\n* Interactive lineage graphs\n\nIf you want to check it out, I have a really easy quick start that with docker-compose which will pre-populate with some test assets:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/marmotdata/marmot \n    cd marmot/examples/quickstart  \n    docker compose up\n    \n    # once started, you can access the Marmot UI on localhost:8080! The default user/pass is admin:admin\n\nI'm hoping to get v0.3.0 out soon with some additional features such as OpenLineage support and an Airflow plugin\n\n[https://github.com/marmotdata/marmot/](https://github.com/marmotdata/marmot/)",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI recently transitioned from a Data Analyst to a Data Engineer role at a startup and I'm facing a significant architectural challenge. I would appreciate any advice or guidance.\n\n**The Current Situation:**\n\nWe have an ETL pipeline that ingests data from Firestore. The source of this data is JSON outputs generated by the OpenAI API, based on dynamic, client-specific prompts. My boss and the CTO decided that this data should be stored in structured tables in a PostgreSQL database.\n\nThis architecture has led to two major problems:\n\n1. **Constant Schema Changes & Manual Work:** The JSON structure is client-dependent. Every time a client wants to add or remove a field, I receive a request to update the OpenAI prompt. This requires me to manually modify our ETL pipeline and run ALTER TABLE commands on the SQL database to accommodate the new schema.\n2. **Rigid Reporting Structure:** These PostgreSQL tables directly feed client-facing reports in Metabase. The tight coupling between the rigid SQL schema and the reports makes every small change a multi-step, fragile, and time-consuming process.\n\n**My Question:**\n\nHow can I handle this problem more effectively? I'm looking for advice on alternative architectures or key concepts I should learn to build a more flexible system that doesn't break every time a client's requirements change.\n\n**ETL Details:**\n\n* The entire pipeline is written in Python.\n* The data volume is not the issue (approx. 10,000 records daily). The main pain point is the constant manual effort required to adapt to schema changes.\n\nThank you in advance for any suggestions",

That means someone from your team (even the “Excel-as-a-database” crowd) can write a valid contract in a single video call, while your data engineers focus on more important work than hunting schema bugs.\n\nThis lets you:\n\n* Move validation responsibilities earlier in the process\n* Collaborate with non-tech teammates\n* Keep pipelines clean and predictable\n\n# Tech bits:\n\n* Python lib: data-sitter (Pydantic-based)\n* TypeScript lib: WASM runtime\n* Contracts are compatible with JSON Schema\n* Open source: [GitHub](https://github.com/lcandea/data-sitter)\n\n# Coming soon:\n\n* Auto-generate contracts from real files (infer types, rules, descriptions)\n* Export to Zod, AVRO, JSON Schema\n* Cloud API for validation as a service\n* “Validation buffer” system for real-time integrations with external data providers\n\n",

Each module includes unit tests that double as usage examples, and the documentation is enriched with inline code and doctests.\n\nRight now, I'm focusing on expanding the DataFrame and CSV functionality. I'd love to hear ideas or suggestions for other features you'd find useful - especially if they fit the project's educational focus.\n\n### What's inside:\n\n* **Matrix operations**: element-wise arithmetic, boolean logic, transposition, etc.\n* **DataFrames**: column-major structures with labeled columns and typed row indices\n* **Compute module**: stats, analysis, and ML models (correlation, regression, PCA, K-means, etc.)\n* **Random utilities**: both pseudo-random and cryptographically secure generators\n* **In progress**: heterogeneous DataFrames and CSV parsing\n\n### Known limitations:\n\n* Not memory-efficient (yet)\n* Feature set is evolving\n\n### Links:\n\n* GitHub: [Magnus167/rustframe](https://github.com/Magnus167/rustframe) (includes CI/CD and self-hosted runners)\n* Crates.io: [rustframe](https://crates.io/crates/rustframe)\n* Homepage & Examples: [magnus167.github.io/rustframe](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/)\n* Docs:\n  [magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs/)\n  or\n  [docs.rs/rustframe](https://docs.rs/rustframe/latest/rustframe/)\n* [Benchmark report](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/benchmark-report/)\n* [CodeCov report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/Magnus167/rustframe/)\n\nI'd love any feedback, code review, or contributions!\n\nThanks! \n",

We’re considering replacing it entirely with DuckDB + Ducklake, working directly on Parquet files stored in S3, without any additional database layer.\n\n• Users can update data via the UI, which we plan to support using inline updates (DuckDB writes). \n• Analytical jobs that update millions of records currently take hours – with DuckDB, we’ve seen they could take just minutes. \n• All data is stored in columnar format and compressed, which significantly reduces both cost and latency for analytic workloads.\n\nTo support Ducklake, we’ll be using PostgreSQL as the catalog backend, while the actual data remains in S3.\n\nThe only real pain point we’re struggling with is retrieving a record by ID efficiently, which is trivial in MongoDB.\n\nSo here’s my question: Does it sound completely unreasonable to build a production-grade system that relies solely on Ducklake (on S3) as the primary datastore, assuming we handle write scenarios via inline updates and optimize access patterns?\n\nWould love to hear from others who tried something similar – or any thoughts on potential pitfalls.",

For someone just starting their programming journey now, what would you recommend they focus on?\n\n\n\nSome specific questions I'm wondering about:\n\n\n\n\\- Are traditional fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, etc.) still as crucial when AI can handle a lot of implementation?\n\n\\- Which programming languages or technologies seem most future-proof right now?\n\n\\- What soft skills or ways of thinking are becoming more important as the technical barriers lower?\n\n\\- How should new programmers approach learning alongside AI tools rather than competing with them?\n\n\n\nI'd love to hear from both experienced developers and fellow newcomers about what you think will matter most going forward. What are you focusing your learning on, and what gaps do you see in the current market?\n\n\n\nThanks for any insights!",

I find a project with source code (usually from GitHub or a course).\n2. I go through the code and figure out which parts I don’t understand.\n3. I take crash courses or quick tutorials on those missing concepts.\n4. Then I try to rebuild the project from scratch on my own.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of people here say that building your own stuff is the key, and I totally get that. But as a beginner, building something *completely* on my own still feels a bit overwhelming. So this method has been kind of a middle ground for me. I’m currently thinking to work on 3–4 projects using this approach.\n\nJust wondering — does this sound like a good learning path? Has anyone else tried something similar or got any tips to improve it?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!",

I can execute tasks well but really struggle a lot with designing solutions to problems or critiquing designs to suggest improvements or point out potential holes. When I try to review code I can spot simple mistakes, but amn't able to give anything more indepth (pointing out areas of refactoring, inefficiencies, suggesting alternative ways of solving the problem) and don't know where to start. When I start looking at reviews I can just feel my mind go blank instead of being able to break down the review and think through what's going on with it or what could be done better.\n\nBecause I've been working in this career for quite some time I feel bad even asking for help, I've managed to struggle my way through it so far but it's very stressful and I don't want to feel so incompetent and afraid when doing my job.

No matter, anyway, i still have the Final Thesis to complete and took one year to focus on it since i can continue working my student job, which is great for me. So i was mostly stumbling through the 3 years, managing to get where i am with hope and prayers. The teachers said how they are teaching us the basics and how to learn to learn (their words).   \n  \nSo i am asking for any advice how and where to learn. Those who have experience and learned online through forums and sites, what do you recommend? How did you memorize the important bits, how did you start understanding it, any tricks how to be better at programming, what learning technique could be applied to learning different languages and so on... We learned some c++ and python, but mostly c#, xml, php. In my free time i've focused mostly on javascript, html and css since i'm interested in making websites and web applications. Let's say i'm a noob with basic knowledge, what would you recommend? Got 1 year before i need to look for a job and alot of free time.",

After a week of doing them I forgot them I just can not get the idea to solve them but when I am revising or solving  them I can do them pretty well.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I tried to learn CS both out of an interest to learn about applied mathematics field and to understand the theory behind software development. \n\nI had taken an intermediate java course and while I often asked for help, I thought I was prepared for the next semester of: linear algebra, intro to discrete math, intro to dsa. I failed all of these classes simultaneously despite my efforts.\n\nIn linear algebra I think I failed because I could not rely on recognizing patterns within the syntax and formatting of the problem, and even when I tried to review axioms and patterns from lecture I still wasn't prepared for the vast variety of scenario problems, especially if I had to try and recognize which parts of the problem were which fact or formula due to the problem being a real world scenario example where the properties are not labelled. When I would try to ask other students how they were comprehending the material they mainly gave general study tips such as going through textbook problems and watching 3blue1brown. When I would do textbook problems because the homework was assigned by the university question bank  based on 'real world/puzzle scenarios' and not the professor.  I never felt prepared even after going through several textbook problems,  but that was not an excuse- I just wasn't sure what I needed to know to be able to answer \\*any\\* linear algebra question. I would try rewriting facts on paper over and over, I would try asking myself conceptual questions and going through the lecture until I could answer my own problems, which was not manageable because I would run out of time for my homework I was struggling to do no matter how many textbook problems I tried in preparation.\n\n  \nIn discrete math I failed I believe because I was too pre-occupied in surviving linear algebra and intro to dsa that I also was unprepared for the puzzle format of the class because linear algebra was already a puzzle to me.\n\n  \nIn intro to dsa I failed because I lacked programming experience to implement the algorithms and data structures we were learning from scratch as per instruction, and the teacher even told me that my programming skills were too remedial. I also wasn't making any projects outside of class to catch up because I was butting heads with linear algebra.\n\nI ended up feeling I spent too much time just trying to survive my math classes, and I failed anyways.\n\nI have tried just focusing on programming since I had to drop out of CS irregardless due to not being able to afford more than 2 more years of college at most and everything going all over the place in my family finances and working full time during school.  I was barely a freshman in terms of core class credits going into junior year,  but  I don't want to give up and still want to technically finish a CS  degree curriculum  on my own even if my degree is no longer CS.\n\nWhen I am given advice on how to learn programming, the advice is to find a field of interest and start making projects from scratch, but I'm not sure how to make projects from scratch if both my programming  and computer science skills are novice. I then watch a tutorial 'for complete beginners' in a field such as gamedev or android app development, I learn about methods and variables from programming frameworks such as godot or kotlin, but I still don't really understand the design of the library and how everything works. \n\nwhen I am having trouble making a project from scratch I am told to start very simple, but even things such as \"how to draw a 2d triangle program\"  opens up a new journey  learning the  opengl library which I don't have the cs/programming skills to properly parse the documentation, or watching a tutorial, trying to search up the code I see in the documentation, and still not understanding.\n\n\n\nI have still tried to review intro to dsa and discrete math, but I don't feel any more prepared programming wise when going through topics such as cardinality of sets or linked lists. To understand these concepts more I am told to try implementing them from scratch..but I don't know how. \n\nI then go back to an \"intro to java/python/c# course\" for the nth time, go over arrays, variable types, string, int, if else statements, loops, nested loops, pointers, but still don't feel I know how to design a program and implement it in code. I still don't feel I understand the native library in those languages. I don't understand how a computer is able to encode the concept of inequality such as 2 <3 or why I need a current and temp variable when traversing an array or swapping array values.\n\n\n\nI'm not quite sure how to move forward. \n\n  \n",

I see so many job postings and new projects built with this combination. I'm really curious to hear your thoughts on why this happens.\n\nIs it simply because they're a \"safe\" and established choice? Are there specific technical advantages that make them so popular, or is it a kind of self-perpetuating cycle where everyone learns them because they're popular, which in turn makes them more popular?\n\nOn a related note, this got me thinking about languages that were once super popular but have since fallen out of favor. For example, **PHP** used to be huge, powering a massive chunk of the web. What do you think led to its decline in popularity compared to other options? Was it a lack of features, performance issues, or did other languages just innovate faster?\n\nI'd love to hear your insights and experiences!

I don't have a job in programming, only have 1 major project under my belt, and I still have a lot to learn.\n\nNow for my advice that I wished I knew when I started out: code by discipline, not by inspiration.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? Well, you know how some of you guys (typically beginners) will wait until you get a cool idea of what to code like a poker game or a new mod for minecraft, code it, then wait for your next big idea to come to you? Yeah stop doing that. Waiting on motivation to code won't build good habits and at the end of the day you can't make it that far, not just in getting a job but in your personal growth as well. Coding by discpline means to code something, anything every day or whatever interval you want to set. If you don't have an idea, search for one online. Maybe even do some leetcode problems if nothing interests you that day. But, you have to do something. After all, if you want to get a job in coding you will have to code every day. Might as well get used to it early right? But yeah, just waiting until ispiration strikes means you won't code as many projects as you could've if you just coded say a small add function to a calculator, or the collision physics for snake instead of doing nothing.\n\nAnyways, that's my advice. What do you guys think of it? I hope this helps someone out starting coding!",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm currently in university and have only learned the *very basics* of C and some other things related to programing and Software Engineering. I got into an internship (called FTT) where I was placed in a project as a backend developer — but there wasn’t much onboarding or guidance.\n\nThe project is a WhatsApp chatbot (not AI-based, just a menu tree of questions and answers to help students with common doubts about our university). The second part is a dashboard for professors to interact with “tickets” — messages from students that the bot couldn’t handle.\n\nAt first, I was excited and learned a lot. I got exposed to things like databases, HTTP requests, backend frameworks, APIs… way more than I ever saw in class. But now I’m stuck. I don’t know what the next step is. I’m just staring at the codebase and feeling completely lost.\n\nTo make things worse, the “client” (university professors) barely show up to clarify things. We don’t know what API to use for WhatsApp integration, and we’re not even sure if we’ll get access to a real number to test the bot properly.\n\nWe had about a month of vacation, and during that time, I started learning Java. It felt cool — I like how structured it is. But despite that, I still feel like I don’t know how to code. I feel like I’m just copying code, Googling everything, and faking my way through things. I don’t feel like a “real” dev. Sometimes I feel like a fraud.\n\nI know this is all part of learning, but it’s hard not to feel lost or like I’m falling behind.\n\nHas anyone else been through something like this? Any advice on how to push through this kind of block?",

Which brought me to the conclusion, wow I really want to continue learning more low/lower level programming. We have a Compiler Construction course and OS development, but I am also afraid of my potential future career; is it worth it to continue down this path? How useful is this even in the modern world?

Every time.  \n  \nAnother example is coding in different languages. If I spend some time with one language or framework, it inevitably leads to forgetting stuff from other languages, and when I switch them, I usually spend more time recalling the stuff I forgot than advancing. It feels like an uphill battle all the time.   \n  \nI'm sure some people manage to overcome these struggles, and so I'm asking - how do you juggle multiple projects, stacks effectively, without losing step at any of them?

To prevent files from touching my server I plan to use pre-signed URLs with some restrictions on file type, size, etc. but I still have some concerns that I am hoping someone could clarify.\n\nI need a way to remove metadata from the images and (I think?) scan them for malware. My approach is to just do this with Lambda and use either a temporary uploads bucket, then run the scans and move to a separate permanent storage bucket, or just upload directly to permanent storage. The part that I am concerned about is that this does not seem to be the industry standard. I have played around with several sites and they all seem to have the same approach. They use a single bucket, and the entire image upload latency is < 5 seconds. After \\~5 seconds the images are uploaded and available via their CDN, the metadata is removed, and I assume they have either already scanned for malware or have queued an async scan.\n\nUnless there is something I am missing, it seems that there is a brief period of time where user content is available via their CDNs but post-upload processing like metadata removal and malware scans have not been completed. Is the the standard approach to just immediately serve images and accept the low levels of risk as a tradeoff for very fast UIs, or is there a better approach that I am unaware of?",

Then I thought I just didnt know the syntax. Now, I’ve realized that u will most likely never know all the built in functions or the syntax, but u still should be able to code and solve problems. \n\nMy biggest issue is this: I dont think I ever approached compsci in a correct way. I just thought if I solve enough questions, if I just see enough codes from the past, I’d be able to get past it like I did with other subjects in high school but it’s not true. The more I try to become better, the more I realize the biggest issue is: I really don’t know how to break down big problems into smaller ones, know how to specify what kind of functions/ datatypes I will use, and solve the problem. I’ve just been learning the syntax, never deeply dove down to the core of the problem, and relying on ai when there are parts I dont know how to fix.\n\n And to make things worse, I really dont know how to practice these things. The more I look at what I’m doing, I’m realizing more that I have really shaky foundations in computer science, and I’m scared because I know in a couple weeks, I’d just have assignments and exams flooding, possibly without fixing the core issues I need to fix.

Can they even work with an existing WordPress site just for these specific tasks?\n3. If you have any **links to guides or tutorials** for someone in my exact situation, that would be amazing.\n\nAny pointers you can give would be a massive help. Thanks so much for reading!",

But lately I have been struggling with the question of what and how should I persue ahead in cybersecurity. I got interested in computers because of being fascinated by videos on linux and networking and cybersecurity tools. But my peers have been focusing on DSA and building a good CodeForces rating and participating in competitive coding to get a good placement at the end of of college. I tried doing this but haven't been able to stay on track. I know that knowledge of data structures and algorithms is necessary and needed in cybersec too but I feel like I should focus more on ctf and knowing tools and doing something practical and learn things as I go. But I fear I might be wrong and the way I think might not be the way to go. I need experienced advice on how should I proceed ahead.  \nI am interested in lot of things right now like low-level programming and how operating systems and native application work, web development and exploitation, and networking related stuff and even some quantitative finance as it requires low-level knowledge too. I completed OverTheWire Bandit and hackthissite.org's basic level and found it really interesting and fun. I have heard of TryHackMe and HackTheBox too. What should I do and how do I go on ahead?  \nMay be my question is stupid or irrelevant to this subreddit but I need some direction and experienced guidance right now to lead me in the right direction.3",

        "author": "YangLorenzo",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone! 👋\n\nI'm excited to announce **WallpaperSwitcher 3.0**, the latest release of my first actually useful C# WinForms project!\n\n#### What is WallpaperSwitcher?\n\nA minimal, fast, and practical desktop wallpaper switcher for Windows (8/10/11), written in C# with WinForms and .NET 9. It allows you to manage wallpaper folders and switch wallpapers with ease—ideal for those who prefer static wallpapers and want something simpler than Wallpaper Engine.\n\n**Core Features**:\n* **Next wallpaper**: Switch wallpapers with a click.\n* **Folder management**: Add, remove, or switch between wallpaper folders.\n* **Hotkey support**: Assign hotkeys to switch wallpapers or folders quickly.\n* **Startup support**: Enable launch on Windows startup.\n* **System tray support**: Runs in the background with tray icon support—hotkeys still work.\n* **Settings UI**: Easily manage folders, hotkeys, and other settings via a dedicated window.\n* **Two wallpaper switch modes**:\n  * **Native Mode**: Uses Windows SlideShow API (smoother but slower switching).\n  * **Custom Mode**: Direct wallpaper setting via Win32 API (faster, emulates slideshow behavior).\n\n#### Why I built this\n\nAs a long time **Wallpaper Engine** user, I started growing tired of dynamic wallpapers high power usage, choppy animations during frequent `Alt + Tab`, and lack of portability made me look for alternatives. I began using static wallpapers manually and realized I didn’t need all those extra features. I just wanted a fast, reliable wallpaper switcher and so I built one.\n\nOriginally considered WPF, WinUI 3, or even Avalonia, but chose **WinForms** for its simplicity and low learning curve. I was able to build a working prototype in just a few hours after watching some tutorials and reading Microsoft docs.\n\n--- \n\n**What’s new in 3.0.0**\n\n* ✅ Full settings UI (no more editing config files manually!)\n* ✅ Hotkey system\n* ✅ Dual wallpaper switch modes: Native vs Custom\n* ✅ Better folder switching logic\n* ✅ System tray + auto-start support\n* ✅ UI improved using hand-written `.Designer.cs` (more on that below 👇)\n\n---\n\n**About the UI**\n\nI initially relied on Visual Studio’s WinForms Designer. But I wanted a cleaner, more modern look—something like Java Swing’s *FlatLaf*. I couldn’t find a suitable theming library for WinForms, so I turned to AI assisted code transformation.\n\nI uploaded my `*.Designer.cs` files and asked AI to refactor the UI styling. After several iterations, I got a design I was happy with. The catch? The updated UI broke Designer compatibility in Visual Studio so now I maintain the UI purely via code. It’s a tradeoff, but acceptable for a mostly stable project.\n\n---\n\n**Architecture decisions**\n\n* **Two-project structure**:\n\n  * `WallpaperSwitcher.Core`: Logic layer (hotkeys, folder mgmt, wallpaper APIs).\n  * `WallpaperSwitcher.Desktop`: UI layer (WinForms).\n* Started with `DllImport + SystemParametersInfo`, later switched to `LibraryImport` for better AOT support.\n* Eventually migrated all native API calls to **[CsWin32](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32)**. This made the code much cleaner and easier to manage—highly recommended if you deal with Windows APIs.\n\n---\n\n**Tech stack**\n\n* C# (.NET 9)\n* WinForms\n* CsWin32 (for Windows API interop)\n* Visual Studio + Rider (design/code split)\n\n---\n\n📦 **Project & Source Code**\n👉 GitHub: [https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher](https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher)\n\nAny feedback, suggestions, or code critiques would be super appreciated. I'm still learning C# and desktop development in general, and I’ve learned **a ton** during this project—especially around COM interop, hotkey registration, and Windows APIs.\n\nThank you all for reading! 🙏\nIf you’re someone like me who just wants a simple, no bloat wallpaper switcher give it a try!\n",

Wouldn't it make more for it to be set up as foundCountry == false?\n\n       // Find country's index and average TV time\n       foundCountry = false;\n       for (i = 0; (i < ctryNames.size()) && (!foundCountry); ++i) {\n          if (ctryNames.at(i) == userCountry) {\n             foundCountry = true;\n             cout << \"People in \" << userCountry << \" watch \";\n             cout << ctryMins.at(i) << \" mins of TV daily.\" << endl;\n          }\n       }\n       if (!foundCountry) {\n          cout << \"Country not found; try again.\" << endl;\n       }\n       \n       return 0;\n    }",

One of the main reasons is that my salary hasn't kept pace with industry standards, which has made me feel undervalued in my role.\n\nOver time, I've learned a lot through trial and error, but I've also tried to use my own knowledge and experience to improve my skills. Unfortunately, as one of the remote workers in the company, they are mobbing me to leave. As a result, my team pushing me to do tasks like meetings, ci/cd deployments and documentation. Limiting my work but I still do the coding stuff because Im the one who is pushing for it and I dont get any support from my team. It started be like this since last 2 years. First 2 years were great and I learned a lot in those times.\n\nI've found it tough to balance my work and personal life because of work times and getting tired from sitting for 8-10 hours. These has made it hard for me to find time to learn new things outside of work. \n\nI have applied for jobs but I've often struggled with basic development trivia questions because I haven't been keeping up as much as I'd like or memorizing about everything about the technology I used.\n\nIn one of the applications that did showcase my skills was the one I created a microservice from stratch. But after the project interview they wanted me to write some basic code(reverse the string they provided). It took me a bit longer than expected to get it done because I wasnt going to write code in the interview from what they told, my laptop was in a way to show my face which didnt had room for me to write but I managed to write it with some debugging. It wasnt enough for them I think they just declined my application. I applied to here through a senior friend and they thought how did he create all of this by himself, must have got helped which I didnt get any.\n\nAnyway, now I'm feeling a bit stuck and unsure about how to move forward. Despite knowing a lot about project structures and API design, backend development etc... I'm not feeling like my skills are growing as quickly as I'd like. \n\nIm doing some leetcode, hackerrank examples and studying some topics (taking notes) but yet Its not enough or match the criteria for the applications. Sometimes I feel like I cant write code without looking to documentation or examples. And sometimes I cant write it out of my head, I know what to create or write as an idea but the functions or annotations are not in my memory all the time, I have to look for the usage.\n\nI'm wondering how can I make some changes or seek out new opportunities to learn and grow. Im really tired of this loop, feeling like exhausted but need a job for living. I keep learning, taking notes etc but Im still here without moving forward",

I’m aiming to get into front end web dev / software dev, but I’m seeing how tough it is for new grads with no experience. I'm honestly just hoping to land any position that relates to my degree now.\n\nThe only job I’ve had is working at Burger King for a year. I know I messed up not doing internships during school. Skill-wise, I know HTML, CSS, some basic JavaScript, C++, Java, and SQL. I’ve been working through The Odin Project but I’m only around halfway through the Foundations section. It’ll probably take me well into next year to finish the whole curriculum and ideally I’d like to be working before then.\n\nI know this kind of post probably shows up here a lot, and I’ve done a bit of googling and researching already. I guess I just want to feel more certain about what all my options really are, given my situation and in todays market (since it seems to shift around quickly).\n\nAfter researching, I'm wondering if I should just get my A+ cert and try to land a help desk job for now. I’d honestly prefer not to go that route, but if it’s the most realistic way to get a foot in the door, I’ll do it.\n\nSo basically I’m wondering:  \n– Is it still worth trying to get an internship now, even after graduating?  \n– Are there other entry-level roles besides help desk that I can realistically land with my degree + skills in 2025?  \n– Given where I’m at, what should I focus on most right now?\n\nAny advice or personal experience would be really appreciated. Just trying to get a better sense of direction. Thanks",

To get a better understanding of what is going on under the hood and make small changes myself to rely less on AI. I've built a couple more simple web apps hosted on vercel and supabase. Also learned git and pushing to github.\n\nThen I discovered Svelte and my life changed, it is amazing. Nextjs is fairly poopy in comparison.

The Svelte docs seem geared to experienced coders.\n\nLooking for any good resources to teach me webdev concepts e.g. when to use components, props, state, effects, best practices for API calls to the backend, etc. In one project I was manually calling the same component multiple times, then I saw a youtube video on how to use For Each to iterate through it.

        "content": "I’ve been keeping an eye on ChatGPT as it’s evolved, and with the release of ChatGPT 5, it honestly feels like the improvements have slowed way down. Earlier versions brought some pretty big jumps in what AI could do, especially with coding help. But now, the upgrades feel small and kind of incremental. It’s like we’re hitting diminishing returns on how much better these models get at actually replacing real coding work.\n\nThat’s a big deal, because a lot of people talk like AI is going to replace software engineers any day now. Sure, AI can knock out simple tasks and help with boilerplate stuff, but when it comes to the complicated parts such as designing systems, debugging tricky issues, understanding what the business really needs, and working with a team, it still falls short. Those things need creativity and critical thinking, and AI just isn’t there yet.\n\nSo yeah, the tech is cool and it’ll keep getting better, but the progress isn’t revolutionary anymore. My guess is AI will keep being a helpful assistant that makes developers’ lives easier, not something that totally replaces them. It’s great for automating the boring parts, but the unique skills engineers bring to the table won’t be copied by AI anytime soon. It will become just another tool that we'll have to learn.\n\nI know this post is mainly about the new ChatGPT 5 release, but TBH it seems like all the other models are hitting diminishing returns right now as well.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

        "author": "FredWeitendorf",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "A lot of standard advice for applicants are obsolete or actively harmful now. I guess this is my attempt at a PSA, to try to explain things from the other side of the table, because it really pains me to see young candidates I might have otherwise hired follow actively harmful advice.\n\n(Some background: I run the full recruiting process for my startup without any recruiters, and since my company is small, I'm also the hiring manager for everybody I interview, and fill all the typical HR roles too. We don't have any interview quotas, ATS filters, etc)\n\nLet me start with what I think about when hiring, because I think candidates may \"know\" these are important but don't fully recognize how it impacts everything else. I'm gonna put some stuff in **bold** for the skimmers.\n\nNumber one most important thing: **Can I trust this person?** Are we going to be happy working with each other?\n\nNumber two most important thing: **How well will they be able to do the job?** Note that this is not whether they *can* do the job now.\n\nThird most important thing: **Do they genuinely want to work here, will they be happy here, and do they \"get it\"? Or, are they just saying/doing whatever they think will maximize their chance of a job offer?** Obviously, they wouldn't be here if not for the money. But if they bring a bad attitude to work, or dislike their job, they literally make it worse for everyone else at the workplace.\n\nNone of that should be surprising. But where things break down is when candidates start thinking about interviewing as an adversarial problem of hyper-optimization and beating the system, **they might improve something small at the expense of completely disqualifying themselves on the really important stuff like trustworthiness or perceived competence.** And I think most don't realize it.\n\nHere are a few common examples:\n\n* Sending very flowery, \"fake personalized\", **clearly-chatgpt-written emails and messages** when I reach out to set up times or talk about the role; ditto with followups and DMs. -> I lose trust and think the candidate has poor communication skills, because they don't understand why this is bad and noticeable.\n* Using **interview assistants. It's not very hard to spot.** Even when candidates do a very good job at hiding it in coding interviews and throw in spelling/other mistakes to cover it up, when you pull some hyper-specific library type out of nowhere, or jump directly into coding without being able to reason through it first, or have an extreme mismatch/inconsistencies in the quality of your answers... you can tell. And actually, interviewers are not expecting absolute perfection! We're trying to gauge whether you have the technical, problem-solving, and communication skills to be effective at your job.\n* Resumemaxxing/ai resume and other applicant tools: Really well formatted resumes with lots of metrics were strong positive signals in years past because they were obvious testaments to the candidate's attention to detail and ability to recognize the impact of their work. But now anybody can generate reasonable-looking resume fodder, or a personal website, in 20s. And there are all these tools to help you explain things in terms of your resume during the interview, or directly reach out to hiring managers, or automatically tune your resume for each job posting so now **the standard tips and tricks to \"stand out\" are unimportant or negative signals, unless they're really exceptionally creative.**\n* Trying to feign knowledge or interest in certain tools/products/the company/role without knowing enough about the thing to feign the right way, or trying to confidently explain something made up/embellished/they don't know very well. A lot of candidates who do everything else right struggle with this. The thing is that being able to recognize when you don't know something, and the trust that when someone doesn't know something they'll speak up, is extremely important for early career engineers (whereas in college it's better to guess on an exam than leave it blank). And **50% of the recruiting process is trying to keep out bullshitters, so even a little bit of bullshit can hurt a lot.**\n\nWhat these all have in common is that candidates don't fully understand how they'll be perceived when doing them. I see on this subreddit a lot that all the other candidates are doing these things (not true) so it's just necessary to be competitive as an applicant now. But actually, **so many candidates are doing these things that hiring at the entry-level has become extremely low-trust and challenging, because constant exposure to bullshit has you default to being skeptical of candidates' authenticity, skills, and personality. What you might think makes you look better actually makes you look like the other 60% of applicants coming across inauthentically, who aren't getting hired.**\n\n(cont. below: what to do instead)",

I haven't seen any major headlines about Apple laying off thousands of employees in 2025 or even earlier.\n\nWhat makes Apple different? Is it due to more conservative hiring during the pandemic? Better product pipeline stability? Just good PR?\n\nWould love to hear thoughts from folks working in tech or at Apple itself. Is Apple really handling things differently ?\n\n",

On top of that, the May and June numbers were revised. 19,000 jobs were added in May and 14,000 jobs were added in June. Presumably next month or in September we will see revisions to the July numbers and they will be cut as well. The number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or longer increased to 1.83 million from 1.65 million in June. A lot of people have been making posts lately saying this sub is just doom-and-gloom and the market is better than what people here are saying, but the numbers speak for themselves. Things really are dire in the U.S. market and now there is hard data to prove it.

I told her I was out of town and couldn’t work — which was true. I’ve got four kids and my weekends are usually packed, especially with no notice.\n\nThe following Monday in standup, she brought it up — saying she should have communicated earlier, but also added that she expected the team to step up and work weekends to meet deadlines. I mentioned  I wouldn’t be available the coming  weekend either if that’s what she was expecting. It was my son’s birthday weekend. They worked til  midnight that Saturday.\n\nFor context: my manager has always been happy with my work. She’s consistently appreciated my contributions and never had any complaints about my performance. The only “issue” seems to be that I don’t volunteer for extra work. lol. She’s made comments in the past like she wants me to “see the bigger picture” and help other teams.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, she asked if I’d be available the second weekend of September for another deadline. At the time, I said I should be. But since then, my wife made plans for that weekend, so I updated my manager and told her I wouldn’t be available anymore in case she needs people to work.\n\nShe wasn’t happy and said something like, “I can’t keep asking the same person to work on weekends,” referring to a coworker who regularly puts in 50–60 hours. I replied, “That’s a personal choice. I already stretch my weekdays beyond 40 hours. I choose to spend weekends with my family. If every release requires weekend work, then we have a process problem.”\n\nNow I’m brushing up my resume. Haven’t interviewed in over 10 years……\n",

It’s the only proper job offer I’ve ever received. I came in at the minimum, making a bit over $50k. I was happy to finally have a job.\n\nThe job is stable. Demands are more than reasonable. But with 6 YoE, I make under $80k in a top 10 US metro. I'm in the bottom 20% of my pay band. I’ve argued for raises. Answer is basically, \"why should we?\" It's frustrating, but I realize that if I don't have any offer letters as leverage, then they *don't* have any reason to do anything. And raises are now frozen for *everyone* due to federal funding changes. Meanwhile, my coworkers are in the top half, if not top third or quarter of their pay bands, making $30k+ more than me. And don't even get me started on how I compare to the figures on levels.fyi or Glassdoor.\n\nI’ve been applying since I got my 401k vested, which coincided with the job market starting to fall apart. The search has not been successful or positive or encouraging. It's particularly disheartening to know that people out there with actual expertise and proper CS degrees and double/triple my YoE are also struggling. If *they* can't find jobs, what chance do *I* have?\n\nMaybe I am still behind in some ways, but I *have* improved. I’ve gotten promoted. (Even though the promotion just put me at a lower percentile in my new pay band.) I get positive feedback from PMs and BAs, and a coworker recently said he's even impressed with how far I've come on a history degree and that he thinks I might make a good architect someday. Their praise doesn't translate into anything material, of course.\n\nI had always had an interest in tech, but this is not a case of \"I love code, but the bureaucracy is killing me.\" These days, I *prefer* the requirements gathering and backlog refinement sessions to head-down coding. I didn't exactly get into this field as a fulfillment of a lifelong passion. I think early on I felt gratification in helping people *via* the code. But there's not joy inherent to the code itself. Nowadays, my work feels disconnected from real users. It feels like grinding through abstract problems created by the tools themselves. Some days I wish I never had to touch code ever again.\n\nMaybe my mentality would change if I felt like I had a future, even a path to just being a median developer making a median salary. But right now, I don't see it.\n\nI don't think every person is necessarily cut out for every type of job. Am I just not cut out to be a developer? Or maybe not cut out for it anymore?

I don't really want to work at a FAANG company, and I don't really need huge TC. I'm pretty content to work at a smaller company that isn't doing anything in the AI realm, a company that makes \"boring\" software with a \"boring\" tech stack.\n\nDoes anyone know what that world is like right now? I'd be pretty content to take an $80k/year TC package doing, say, PHP if it meant I didn't have to go through months of screenings and assignments competing with 200 other resumes. Or are even the small companies inundated with applicants, doing 4+ rounds of interviews for mid-level positions?\n\nThanks!",

It's feeding into a regime that I will withhold my feelings about so as not to get too political, but suffice it to say I vehemently disagree with. \n\nThe rest of the job ads are so hotly contested and so few and far between that I have barely any shot of competing for them, and even those jobs are still mildly problematic, but at least it's only in the same old ways that they've always been (ie. Banking, marketing).\n\nSorry if this has been said before by others but the feeling of needing to sell my soul to these companies that are speedrunning societal destruction makes me want to throw myself into a river rather than prostrate myself at their feet hoping a little bit of their plundered wealth trickles into my pockets.",

For a bit of background information, I graduated with a bachelor's degree from a top public school back in 2022 and have since been struggling really hard to find a job in the field. During university, I didn't do any internship because I was a first generation in my family and severely underestimated its value. I took a gap year after graduation for mental health reasons and did not start job finding until 2023. In the past 2 years, I've landed less than 10 interviews. Not once did I make it past the first screening, be it technical or behavioral. I'm well aware that the market is struggling right now, but my past decisions to not do any internship or taking the gap year certainly did not help. But that's not what I want to focus on.\n\nDuring my job search, I wasn't selective about the roles in the slightest. I applied to roles that required relocation to the other side of the country, local roles, remote roles, roles in the financial sector, the defense sector, government jobs, etc. If it was an entry level SWE/QA role and I qualified for it, I applied. I know that the longer I stay unemployed, the harder it is to get a foot into the field. For that reason, I've spent most of my days working on projects to keep myself marketable. I have published a mobile app that has 1,500 monthly active users, but that didn't seem to help my chances at all. I would be lucky to even get a rejection email. I feel really lost and don't know what else I can be doing.\n\nLately I've contemplated changing fields or maybe even picking up a skill trade. But that feels like giving up finding a job in this field in the future, since I will have significantly less time to keep my skills marketable. The thought of throwing away all my time and effort saddens me, but this status quo can't last. Luckily, I've been living with my parents so I'm not at risk of homelessness. But I want to live a life and I don't know if I can continue working on projects and applying to applications and pray for an opportunity that may never come. If you were in my position, what would you do? Are there roles that utilize my degree that are in demand? Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thanks for your time.\n\nHere's my resume for the ones that care: [Resume](https://imgur.com/a/88MUfWW)\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for all of the suggestions. I'll be looking into doing a Master's program and getting internships that way. I'll also try to monetize my app and leverage my skills to see if I can start turn it into a business.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "For all the engineers that are feeling invisible, stuck or plateaued, this is for you and hope it helps / guides you into the next steps. \n\nI am a senior software engineer who got to this position pretty fast, and got promoted over other engineers with 3-4x my YoE, so whatever I saw in this post contributed massively to my growth, making my impact visible, getting me recognized, and eventually promoted. \n\nAs a junior engineer, I was always awed by these senior+ engineers who seemed to make such an impact by whatever they did. This led me to start observing and building relationships with some of these really senior engineers around me (staff/principal) and learn how they operated, built that authority around them, and got stuff done, and something clicked. \n\nI realized it wasn’t just about technical skill and crushing tickets. What moved the needle was learning to communicate clearly, understand what impacts the business, build trust, build alignment between stakeholders, and be proactive (taking initiatives) instead of just reactive (wait to get assigned work).\n\nThere is usually a misconception, that to stand out, you just need to work on your technical skills. That is wrong. To get to senior+ you need to hone in on your non-technical skills like communication, how you take initiatives, how you build alignment etc. These are absolutely crucial to be seen as someone with authority, and something most engineers neglect and plateau.\n\nA lot of engineers think that these skills are only required for managers etc, but they are wrong - even ICs require them. \n\nFor these soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing wikis/docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Taking time to write these up can not only promote healthy structured offline discussions (google docs for eg) but also act as an information aggregator for knowledge sharing (instead of being scattered on slack for eg or lost in meetings) and for having an audit log of important decisions - so in the future anyone can refer back to why a decision was taken and one doesn’t have to scramble to remember it, etc. \n\nThe documents that you write now also help you to present your ideas and propose changes in a better manner in live meetings, where you can present that doc during the meetings and walk everyone through it - you don't need to memorize anything since all the information is already there in front of you, in a clean structured manner.\n\nSpeech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.\n\nI worked heavily on my speech. I was afraid to speak in meetings because I was introverted and had confidence issues because I had a bit of stuttering problem, I used to use too many filler words, lose track of thought etc. But I took time to work on it, and over time I started speaking more eloquently and fluently which made such a massive difference in my confidence, and whenever I had to propose something or even speak during meetings, it made a difference. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, technical skills are also important, but as you go up, your mastery of these other non-technical skills starts to matter more. They will make you more visible, your impact more visible, and eventually get you promoted. \n\nSo I urge you to start working on them, you will be surprised just how much difference they make. \n\nIf you are an introvert like me, if I can do it so can you. I used to think these soft skills are reserved for extroverts but I was extremely wrong, and these are most definitely learnable. \n\nLooking forward to hearing in the comments what has worked for other engineers out there as well!\n\nHappy to answer any questions in the comments and DMs! I am an open book and happy to help however I can!",

        "content": "Hey all, I’ve been working as an intern at a small professional services firm since May of last year (so ~1.5 years now). What started as a short summer internship got extended **four times**, every time with vague mentions that I’d be offered a full-time role once \"we finish X\" or \"get through Y.\"\n\nIn the beginning, I was doing analytics-focused work, i.e., building dashboards, eda/reporting for clients, simple regression tasks. It was great. Then, as the team realized more of the analytics was internally focused, we decided to stop client work and migrate our dashboards into the company website. That’s when things shifted. Since I have a background in data science + some experience with full-stack dev, I became the one spearheading the dashboard migration effort.\n\nFor the next 6+ months, I’ve collaborated directly with the dev team, learning React, GraphQL, MongoDB, Docker, Task Scheduling, and D3.js on the fly. It was messy but fulfilling. We were building these tools with hope of scaling them into client-facing tools eventually.\n\nThroughout this, my boss kept saying I’d be the one maintaining these dashboards and owning future projects, especially because I had context on both the data and the dev side. I even got **another** project last month, again with the implication that I was part of long-term plans.\n\nFast forward to now: all three projects are basically done. The dashboards work, the visuals take in prod data, and we’re just ironing out some small aesthetic issues + a rework of some GraphQL logic for one proejct. \n\nAt 9am today, I get a calendar invite for an \"exit interview.\" No warning. I talk to my boss and he flatly tells me my last day is next week (August 11), and to have everything wrapped up and documented by then. That’s it.\n\nNo full-time offer. No more extensions. No transition into another role. Just \"thanks and bye.\"\n\nHonestly, I’m kind of heartbroken. I poured so much time into this place. Took on projects well outside my scope. Built tools that no one else had the technical background for. I **thought** I was doing everything right. My coworkers were surprised to hear I wasn’t being kept. It’s not just me imagining this either. My boss has consistently dragged his feet on giving me a real answer about my future here.\n\nTruthfully, I didn’t even really \"work\"  today. I spent most of it job hunting and planning to use up my accrued PTO before I go. I’m in grad school part-time (1 year left), which I think has scared off a few employers. And it's all starting to sting a bit... Especially since I've grown close to my coworkers and enjoyed the work. \n\nSide note: this is the second time I've been let go. My first job out of college started as an internship but was extended to full time. However, the company laid me off due to budget slashing post-covid. This time around feels very different.\n\nIs it normal to feel like this? To feel like it’s not worth pushing these final 2% of features anymore? Am I being unprofessional by mentally checking out a week before I’m done?\n\nI just feel burned out, a bit betrayed, and unsure of what’s next. Thanks for reading.",

I never ask without trying and saying what I tried because that’s annoying. \n\nI don’t communicate well with my tech lead because he always gets irritated very quickly towards me. Use to laugh and snap at me when I code constantly. Didn’t want to deal with that so I route questions elsewhere.\n\nHad multiple managers and they’re just like “oh if you just do x  (replace x with study outside of work, try before asking a question, say what you tried before asking a question), then they’ll be nicer to you”. Like….ok….havent I been doing that for a year straight?\n\nAnd apparently performance reviews aren’t based on actual goals, but vibes. No one has given me goals yet. I don’t pass my tech leads vibe check so all feedback from him is negative. \n\nI don’t know what they want from me. How do I even improve at this point? I study outside of work, I use ai, like…do I just suck at my job? Do I suck at this field? I don’t get it. \n\nWent to hr, they said “sounds like you’re just complaining that you have to do your work.” \n\nI can get another job, but is that best? Is this a team specific problem?

Most of those solutions do not need large scale system design, you may use containers, may be K8s if you are lucky. But mostly do not need hundreds of microservices, CQRS, event-driven stuff. Even if we have freedom of tech stack we are doing disservice to client and future developers if you did something complicated for resume driven development. While I can try and learn new design patterns, good coding practices, there is no room to build things at scale.\n\nBut when you look at jobs posts, they ask for things like microservices, event-driven design, CQRS, Kafka etc. So my question to those who were in similar situation before, **how to gain experience building things at scale when your work do not need things at scale?** It seems I have been stagnant years without opportunity to involve in systems that need scale.\n",

The story will be refined and discussed and then the sprint will start. After I'm near the finish line and the PR is put out, he will suddenly remember changes that we should add to the feature I'm working on. \n\nThen he pushes for me to make the change in the same sprint by hand waving away \"it should be quick\". I take issue with this because more often than not, when working on the changes he wants, they turn out to not be as straightforward as he thought and I have to work longer to complete the story. \n\nIt wouldn't be such an issue if I found out earlier in the sprint, but with him, it's usually like 1-3 days before the sprint ends and this is a noticeable pattern with him. It drags me down in completing the original task that was assigned to me and the story has chance to rollover and nobody wants that. \n\n I try not to take it personal, but it's getting harder. It's like he purposefully tries to put me in tight spots to try and get out of it. And it's not like I'm trying to not work. I just want to meet the original expectation of my story before going further and doing more work. The changes he talks about make sense, I just think they can be added in a productive stable manner. \n\n",

In my current position it definitely is feeling like I’ve kind of hit the limit of what I can learn. We use a lot of SaltStack and most of my day-to-day is writing custom Python modules to set up small amounts of server  infrastructure by executing those custom modules with SaltStack. More recently we’ve been using Ansible as well, but to me none of this seems like real software engineering work and I’m afraid of being pigeon holed into Platform engineering when I prefer more traditional SWE.\n\nMy question is: how do I properly transition from a more platform oriented role to more SWE oriented? Is that really a thing? I’ve been trying to apply to jobs but every position wants years of enterprise experience in things like Spring, and it seems like the frameworks at this job aren’t used basically anywhere else. Is going to a startup the answer?\n\nThanks for reading! Any advice would be super appreciated ",

Naturally, I decided to major in Computer Science, hoping it would lead to a great job someday.\n\nBut I didn’t realize how difficult that would be—mainly because I live in Iraq, where there’s very little demand for software developers. And when a job does open up, the competition is fierce.\n\nAfter graduating in 2020, I couldn’t find a job for about six months. Eventually, I took a job as a trainer instead of a developer just to pay the bills. During that time, I kept applying to every local and remote opportunity I could find.\n\nAfter two years as a trainer, and out of sheer luck, I landed a paid internship as a full-stack developer. It was borderline slave labor, but I needed the experience. The pay wasn’t bad considering the living costs here. The role was fully remote and contract-based for a U.S. startup.\n\nWhen the internship ended, they offered me a junior full-stack role—again contract-based for six months. But then the startup failed to secure funding, and I was let go.\n\nI was unemployed again for six months until someone I used to work with reached out. They were starting a new company and offered me a frontend position. I worked as the only frontend engineer for eight months. It was another contract gig since they couldn’t legally hire someone from Iraq. The workload was heavy, but I delivered.\n\nThen, once again, the startup failed to get funding and I was let go.\n\nNow I’m working part-time in a government job that has nothing to do with coding. I can’t seem to find any local developer roles or remote contracts anymore. I’ve started to question whether I’m even cut out for a career in software development.\n\nShould I keep looking for a job? Pursue a master’s degree? Switch to a different field entirely? What would you do if you were in my shoes? What does your career path look like?",

        "content": "\nI’m a senior graduating in Spring 2026, and I’ve noticed that a lot of summer internships for next year are already open. Most of them say you need to have at least one semester of school left after the internship ends, which technically I won’t have since I’m finishing my undergrad.\n\nBut I do plan on starting a Master’s program in Fall 2026. I haven’t been accepted into any schools yet since I’m still working on applications, but I know I want to continue right after graduation.\n\nWhat’s the best way to show that I’m planning to go to grad school so I don’t get automatically filtered out? Should I list it under Education on my resume as “Planned” or “Expected”? Or should I mention it in a cover letter or optional section on the application?\n\nHas anyone else been in this situation? I’d appreciate any advice on how to handle it.",

I have 8 YOE now.\n\nI've been at my current employer for 4 years now. But last year new management took over, and things have been slowly going downhill. I would be surprised if we made it another year at this point. So I've started applying for jobs. \n\nI take my time and tailor the resume and cover letter to the posting, and I'm only applying for ones that I'm a good fit for. Despite this, I get rejected automatically. My best guess is that I'm being filtered out based on my degree. Even when it comes to posting that say they'll take equivalent experience. Even if the job only requires 4 years of experience and pays less than what I currently make.\n\nThe problem is that I have a family and a mortgage and all that now, so I can't just drop everything and go back to school. I could do online classes, but there's no way I would be able to finish a degree before this company folds. What do I do?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "In 2026, I'm going to be a grad fresh out of college in Ireland. I want to break into high frequency trading as a SWE and had a roadmap set in my mind for how I would reach my goal in 2 - 3 years time. I wanted to have people's opinion on how realistic this is.\n\n  \nCurrently as part of my placement year (more like semester), I'm interning at IBM. I'm working on Db2 which is IBM's enterprise database solution. If I get a return offer, hopefully, this is what I'll continue working on. Now, I know to break into HFT, I'll need a lot of experience in C++ and I was hoping this opportunity would give me that. I have considered applying to HFT firms but I feel like I won't be able to make it past their interviews since I'm not prepared much in that area and also am quite inexperienced in C++. As Db2 is a database, I'm also getting experience in low latency/high transaction systems, solving concurrency problems. I feel like these are all skills HFT firms value. I understand I'll be lacking in the area of financial knowledge. After 2 years of working here, I hope to get a Master's done with a minor in Finance, after which I plan on applying to HFTs.\n\n  \nWould you say this plan is realistic or are there some changes you would suggest?\n\n  \nThanks as always :)",

I’m very open to any kind of advice, how much further I need to progress to land an internship or entry-level job, what I could be doing better, or what I should avoid completely.\n\n\\*edit:\n\nThank you so much for all your comments! I'm currently trying to work on a project using TypeScript. Coming from JavaScript, the errors and project setup feel a bit strange at first, but from what I’ve seen, moving forward with TypeScript seems like the most sensible path.
