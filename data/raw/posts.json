        "content": "**After working as a DA for 1 year, DS/MLE for 3 years, and DE for 4, my outlook on this field (and life in general, sadly) has never been bleaker.** \n\nEvery position I've been in has had its own frustrations in some way: team is overworked, too much red tape, lack of leadership, lack of organization/strategy, hostile stakeholders, etc...And just recently, **management laid off some of our team because they \"think we should be able to use AI to be more productive\".** \n\nI feel like I have been searching for that mystical \"dream job\" for years, and yet it seems that I am further away from obtaining it as ever before. With AI having already made so much progress, I'm starting to think that this dream job I have been looking for may no longer even exist. \n\nEven though I've enjoyed my job at times in the past, **at this point, I think I'm done with this career.** \n\nI have lost all the passion that I originally had 8 years ago, and I don't foresee it ever returning. What will I do next? Who knows. I have a few months of savings that will keep me afloat before I figure that out, and if money starts running out, my backup plan is to become a surf instructor in Fiji (or something along those lines).   \n\n\n\nBefore the layoffs, my team was already using AI, and, while it's been increasingly useful, the tech is no where near the point of replacing multiple tenured engineers, at least in our situation. \n\nWe've been pretty good on staying up-to-date with AI trends - we hopped on Cursor back in February and have been using Claude Code since April. However, our codebase is way too convoluted for consistent results, and we lack proper documentation for AI agents to implement major changes. After several failed attempts to solve these issues, I find Claude Code only useful for small, localized features or fixes. Until LLMs can extrapolate code to understand the underlying business context, or write code that is fully aware of end-to-end system dependencies, my team will continue to face these problems. \n\n**My favorite part about working in data has always been when I get to solve challenging problems through code, but this has completely disappeared from my day-to-day work**. Writing complex logic is a fun challenge, and it's very rewarding when you finally build a working solution. Unfortunately, this is one of the few things AI is much more efficient than me at doing, so I barely do it anymore. Instead, I'm basically supervising a junior engineer (Claude) that does the work while I handle the administrative / PM duties. Meanwhile, I'm even more busy than before since we are all picking up the extra workload from our teammates that were let go. \n\nAs AI capabilities continue to improve, this part of my job will surely become a larger amount of my time, and I simply can't see myself doing it any more than I already am. I had a short stint as a manager a couple years ago, and while it wasn't for me, it was at least rewarding to help actual people. Instructing a LLM was interesting and fun at first, but the novelty wore off several months ago, and I now find it to be irritating above anything else. \n\nMost of my experience comes from startups and mid-sized companies, but it really hit me yesterday when talking to my friend who is a DS at a FAANG. She has been dealing with her own frustrations at work, and although her situation is very different than mine, she voiced the same negative sentiments that I had been feeling. I am now thinking that my feelings are more widespread than I thought. Or maybe I have just had bad luck. ",

With open source, we’d likely have to combine multiple tools to reach a similar level of functionality. On the plus side, that would give us:\n\n⁠- flexible server scaling based on demand\n- potentially lower costs\n- more flexibility in how we handle different workloads\n\nOn the other hand, Fabric provides a more integrated ecosystem, less overhead in managing different tools, and tight integration with the Microsoft stack.\n\n\n\nAny insights would be super helpful as we’re evaluating the best long-term direction. :)",

        "author": "Key_Salamander234",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\n\n\nSo I've been diving into AI for the past few months (this is actually my first real project) and got a bit frustrated with how \"dumb\" LLMs can be when it comes to navigating complex SQL databases. Standard text-to-SQL is cool, but it often misses the business context buried in weirdly named columns or implicit relationships.\n\n\n\nMy idea was to build a semantic layer on top of a SQL database (PostgreSQL in my case) using a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j. The goal is to give an LLM a \"map\" of the database it can actually understand.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's the core concept:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nInstead of just tables and columns, the Python framework builds a graph with rich nodes and relationships:\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Node Types:\\*\\* We have \\`Database\\`, \\`Schema\\`, \\`Table\\`, and \\`Column\\` nodes. Pretty standard stuff.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Properties are Key:\\*\\* This is where it gets interesting. Each \\`Column\\` node isn't just a name. I use GPT-4 to synthesize properties like:\n\n\\*   \\`business\\_description\\`: \"Stores the final approval date for a sales order.\"\n\n\\*   \\`stereotype\\`: \\`TIMESTAMP\\`, \\`PRIMARY\\_KEY\\`, \\`STATUS\\_FLAG\\`, etc.\n\n\\*   \\`confidence\\_score\\`: How sure the LLM is about its analysis.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Rich Relationships:\\*\\* This is the core of the semantic layer. The graph doesn't just have \\`HAS\\_COLUMN\\` relationships. It also creates:\n\n\\*   \\`EXPLICIT\\_FK\\_TO\\`: For actual foreign keys, a direct, machine-readable link.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*\\`IMPLICIT\\_RELATION\\_TO\\`\\*\\*: This is the fun part. It finds columns that are logically related but have no FK constraint. For example, it can figure out that \\`users.email\\_address\\` is semantically equivalent to \\`employees.contact\\_email\\`. It does this by embedding the descriptions and doing a vector similarity search in Neo4j to find candidates, then uses the LLM to verify.\n\n\n\nThe final KG is basically a \"human-readable\" version of the database schema that an LLM agent could query to understand context before trying to write a complex SQL query. For instance, before joining tables, the agent could ask the graph: \"What columns are semantically related to \\`customer\\_id\\`?\"\n\n\n\nSince I'm new to this, my main question for you all is: \\*\\*is this actually a useful approach in the real world?\\*\\* Does something like this already exist and I just reinvented the wheel?\n\n\n\nI'm trying to figure out if this idea has legs or if I'm over-engineering a problem that's already been solved. Any feedback or harsh truths would be super helpful.\n\n\n\nThanks!",

        "title": "The Anatomy of a S3-Native Distributed Query Engine",
        "author": "heisenberg_zzh",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering,\n\nI'm the co-founder of Databend, an open source Snowflake alternative, and I wanted to share a bit of our journey building a SQL query engine that's designed to live on cloud storage like S3. This isn't a sales pitch—just an honest, educational walkthrough of the \"why\" behind our architecture. If you've ever been curious about what happens inside a query engine or why your queries on data lakes sometimes feel slow, I hope this sheds some light.\n\n**The Dream: A Database on S3**\n\nLike many of you, we love S3. It's cheap, it's huge, and it's durable. The dream is to just point a SQL engine at it and go, without managing a complex, traditional data warehouse. But there's a catch: S3 is a network service, and the network is *slow*.\n\nA single data request to S3 might take 50-200 milliseconds. In that tiny slice of time, your CPU could have executed millions of instructions. If your query engine just sits there and waits for the data to arrive, you're essentially paying for expensive CPUs to do nothing. This latency is the single biggest monster you have to slay when building a database on S3.\n\n**Why We Built a New Query Executor**\n\nWhen we started, we naturally looked at classic database designs. They're brilliant pieces of engineering, but they were born in a world of fast, local disks.\n\n1. **The \"Pull\" Model (aka the \"Volcano\" model):** Think of this like a game of telephone. The final step of your query plan (e.g., `SUM()`) asks the step before it for a row, which asks the step before it, and so on, all the way down to the data source. It's simple and has a nice, natural flow. **But on S3, it's a performance disaster.** When the first operator in the chain asks S3 for data, the *entire assembly line* of operators grinds to a halt. Your CPUs are idle, just waiting for data to arrive, while you're burning money on compute you can't use.\n2. **The \"Push\" Model (Vectorized Execution):** This is more like a factory assembly line. The data source pushes batches of data to the first worker, which processes it and pushes it to the next. It's fantastic for raw CPU performance. **But on S3, it's a memory bomb.** S3 can send data in unpredictable bursts. A fast data-scanning step can easily flood a slower step (like a complex `JOIN`), causing data to pile up in memory until the system crashes.\n\n**From SQL to an Execution Plan**\n\nSo, how does a simple SQL string like `SELECT * FROM ...` turn into a plan that our workers can run? It's a multi-stage process, a bit like a chef turning a recipe into a detailed kitchen workflow.\n\n1. **Parsing:** First, we parse the raw SQL text into a structured format called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This is just a tree that represents the query's grammar, making it understandable for the machine.\n2. **Logical Plan:** Next, we convert the AST into a *logical plan*. This describes the *what* of the query—the sequence of high-level operations needed, like \"scan this table,\" then \"filter these rows,\" then \"aggregate the results.\" It's still abstract and doesn't care about how the data is stored or how many machines we have.\n3. **Physical Plan:** This is where the magic happens. Our query optimizer takes the logical plan and transforms it into a *physical plan*. It looks at table statistics, data layout, and available resources to decide the most efficient *how*. For example, it decides whether to use a Hash Join or a Merge Join, how to distribute work across nodes, and in what order to join tables.\n4. **Executor Graph:** Finally, this physical plan is used to generate the actual graph of `Processor` actors that our scheduler will run. Each step in the physical plan becomes one or more workers in our asynchronous assembly line.\n\nThis whole process ensures that by the time we start executing, we have a cost-optimized, concrete plan ready to go.\n\n**A New Plan: Building for the Cloud**\n\nThe core idea was simple: **a worker should never block waiting for the network.** While it's waiting for S3, it should be able to do other useful work. This is the principle of asynchronous processing.\n\nWe designed a system in Rust based on a few key concepts:\n\n* **Workers as Independent \"Actors\":** Each part of the query plan—a `Filter`, `Join`, `Aggregate`—is an independent worker. Think of it as a specialist on an assembly line with a simple job and its own state.\n* **A Central \"Scheduler\" as the Factory Manager:** Instead of talking to each other, workers report their status to a central scheduler. A worker can raise its hand and say:\n   * \"I'm ready for data!\"\n   * \"I have a batch of data and I'm ready to do some computation.\"\n   * \"I'm about to ask S3 for data, which will take a while. You can check back on me later.\"\n   * \"Whoa, I'm getting overwhelmed! My output buffer is full! Tell the upstream workers to pause.\"\n* **Backpressure as the Safety Valve:** That last status is crucial. It's called **backpressure**, and it's the system's safety valve. It prevents the memory bomb. If a `JOIN` worker gets overwhelmed, it tells the scheduler, which then tells the `Scan` worker to stop fetching data from S3 for a moment. This allows the system to self-regulate and remain stable.\n* **IO Concurrency is Key to Hiding Latency:** Because asking for data is non-blocking, we can ask S3 for hundreds of different data chunks *all at once*. The scheduler then efficiently processes them as they arrive. This allows us to saturate the network connection and hide the latency of any single request, dramatically improving throughput.\n\n**How This Scales to Handle Complex SQL**\n\nThis architecture allows us to scale in two ways:\n\n1. **Multi-threading (Scaling Up):** For a single, large query, we can duplicate parts of the query pipeline. For example, we can have multiple `Scan` and `Partial Aggregate` workers running in parallel on different CPU cores, each processing a different part of the data. A final `Merge` step combines their results.\n2. **Distributed Execution (Scaling Out):** To scale across multiple machines, we treat the network as just another connection between workers. A special `Exchange` worker on one machine can send data to another `Exchange` worker on a different machine. To the rest of the query plan, it's completely transparent. This lets us use the same logic for a single-node query and a 100-node distributed query.\n\n**A Few Hard-Won Lessons**\n\n* **Stability over raw speed:** Building in robust backpressure from day one was the single most important decision for system stability.\n* **Separate your concerns:** We run I/O-heavy tasks (like waiting for the network) and CPU-heavy tasks (like decompressing data) on separate thread pools. This ensures that a long computation doesn't stop the engine from handling new data arriving from S3.\n* **Observability is everything:** When you have thousands of tiny tasks running in parallel, you need great tooling to see what's going on, like query profiles, flamegraphs, and distributed tracing logs to find where the bottlenecks are and why a query is slow.\n\nI hope this was a helpful, non-hyped look into what it takes to build a modern, cloud-native query engine. The concepts of asynchronous processing and backpressure are becoming more and more relevant for all kinds of data systems, not just databases.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions about our architecture or the trade-offs we made!

On top of that, they expect huge changes, endless requirements, and bad deadlines, with constant meetings leaving no time to work. I’m learning a lot, but I’m burned out and doubting if I should stay or return to actuarial work.\n\nI just graduated in May with a degree in Actuarial Science. And over here it’s common to have an internship while still studying during the semester, so almost everyone graduates with around two years of experience. During my internships, I worked on pension and macroeconomics analysis. Later, I had the opportunity to join a BI team at a fintech. There, I helped improve semantic models, fix dashboards with slow refresh times, and implement better practices. After that, I got another internship offer for the Data Engineering team, which was basically a one person team. I decided to give it a shot, and it turned out to be a good experience: I used Azure for the first time, learned some Scala, Airflow, and PySpark.\n\nFast forward to one month before graduation: an international manufacturer contacted me for a Jr DE position. I doubted if I could fit in, since my technical skills weren’t as strong as CS graduates. After three interviews (one with the Senior DE, where we had an amazing conversation), I got the job offer. I was skeptical, but I accepted it because the Senior DE convinced me it was a great opportunity. I even turned down another offer from an insurance company.\n\nTo my surprise, during onboarding they told me the Senior DE had just quit the Friday before, leaving me as the only DE. After some thought, I accepted. But I wasn’t ready for what I found:\n\n* No documentation\n* Broken pipelines\n* Tons of legacy code from outsourcing during the pandemic\n* Broken dashboards and angry users\n* A messy data lake with no organization\n* A passive-aggressive data steward whenever I try to improve workflows\n* A team using Scrum (my first time) with POs who don’t know what they need\n* A project manager who flames us whenever something goes wrong\n* A “data scientist” who is really used as an analytics engineer\n\nRight now, I’m doing my best: learning best practices, writing documentation, and even working extra hours. But it feels like I’m always just fixing problems. There’s one dashboard that breaks almost every day, pipelines that constantly need re-runs, and new business rules popping up all the time. On top of that, leadership keeps pushing for “big changes” with impossible deadlines, constant requirements, and back-to-back meetings that leave me with almost no time to actually focus on building things.\n\nAfter a 1:1 with my manager, he admitted the company’s vision changes almost daily. The CTO once told me about the importance of building a data driven mindset, but just three days later, layoffs happened and the CTO himself was gone. Now I have no guidance, I don’t know where we’re heading, and I’m doubting my skills.\n\n**What would you do in my position? Should I quit and go back to the actuarial path?**",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm excited to share a practical guide on implementing real-time, automated data lineage for Kafka Connect. This solution uses a custom Single Message Transform (SMT) to emit OpenLineage events, allowing you to visualize your entire pipeline—from source connectors to Kafka topics and out to sinks like S3 and Apache Iceberg—all within Marquez.\n\nIt's a \"pass-through\" SMT, so it doesn't touch your data, but it hooks into the `RUNNING`, `COMPLETE`, and `FAIL` states to give you a complete picture in Marquez.\n\n**What it does:**\n- **Automatic Lifecycle Tracking:** Capturing `RUNNING`, `COMPLETE`, and `FAIL` states for your connectors.\n- **Rich Schema Discovery:** Integrating with the Confluent Schema Registry to capture column-level lineage for Avro records.\n- **Consistent Naming & Namespacing:** Ensuring your Kafka, S3, and Iceberg datasets are correctly identified and linked across systems.\n\nI'd love for you to check it out and give some feedback. The source code for the SMT is in the repo if you want to see how it works under the hood.\n\n**You can run the full demo environment here:**\nFactor House Local - https://github.com/factorhouse/factorhouse-local\n\n**And the full guide + source code is here:**\nKafka Connect Lineage Guide - https://github.com/factorhouse/examples/blob/main/projects/data-lineage-labs/lab1_kafka-connect.md\n\nThis is the first piece of a larger project, so stay tuned—I'm working on an end-to-end demo that will extend this lineage from Kafka into Flink and Spark next.\n\nCheers!\n",

        "author": "peterxsyd",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# Dear Data Engineers,\n\nI’ve recently built a production-grade, from-scratch implementation of the ***Apache Arrow*** data standard in **Rust**—shaped to to strike a new balance between ***simplicity***, ***power***, and ***ergonomics***.\n\nI’d love to share it with you and get your thoughts, particularly if you:\n\n* Work in the *(more hardcore end) of the* **data engineering** space\n* Us**e Rust for data pipeline**s, or the Arrow data format for systems / engine / embedded work\n* Build **distributed** or **embedded** software that benefits from Arrow’s memory layout and wire protocols just as much as the columnar analytics it's typically known for.\n\n# Why did I build it?\n\n***Apache Arrow*** (and `arrow-rs`) are very powerful and have reshaped the data ecosystem through zero-copy memory sharing, lean buffer specs, and a rich interoperability story. When building certain types of high-performance data systems in Rust, though (e.g., distributed data, embedded), I found myself running into friction.\n\n# Pain points:\n\n* **Engineering Velocity:** The general-purpose design is great for the ecosystem, but I encountered long compile times *(30+ seconds).*\n* **Heavy Abstraction:** Deep trait layers and hierarchies made some otherwise simple tasks more involved—like printing a buffer or quickly seeing types in the IDE.\n* **Type Landscape:** Many logical Arrow types share the same physical representation. Completeness is important, but in my work I’ve valued a clearer, more consolidated type model. In shaping Minarrow, I leaned on the principle often attributed to Einstein: *“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler\".* This ethos has filtered through the conventions used in the library.\n* **Composability:** I often wanted to “opt up” and down abstraction levels depending on the situation—e.g. from a raw buffer to an Arrow Array—without friction.\n\nSo I set out to build something tuned for engineering workloads that plugs naturally into everyday Rust use cases without getting in the way. The result is an Arrow-*Compatible* implementation from the ground up.\n\n# Introducing: Minarrow\n\nArrow minimalism meets Rust polyglot data systems engineering.\n\n# Highlights:\n\n* Custom `Vec64` allocator: 64-byte aligned, SIMD-compatible. No setup required. Benchmarks indicate alloc parity with standard `Vec`.\n* Six base types (`IntegerArray<T>`, `FloatArray<T>`, `CategoricalArray<T>`, `StringArray<T>`, `BooleanArray<T>`, `DatetimeArray<T>`), slotting into many modern use cases (HFC, embedded work, streaming ) etc.\n* Arrow-compatible, with some simplifications:\n   * Logical Arrow types collapsed via generics (e.g. DATE32, DATE64 → `DatetimeArray<T>`).\n   * Dictionary encoding represented as `CategoricalArray<T>`.\n* Unified, ergonomic accessors: `myarr.num().i64()` with IDE support, no downcasting.\n* Arrow Schema support, chunked data, zero-copy views, schema metadata included.\n* Zero dependencies beyond `num-traits` *(and optional Rayon).*\n\n# Performance and ergonomics\n\n* **1.5s clean build,** <**0.15s rebuilds**\n* **Very fast runtime** *(See laptop benchmarks in repo)*\n* **Tokio-native IPC:** async IPC Table and Parquet readers/writers via sibling crate *Lightstream*\n* **Zero-copy MMAP r**eader *(\\~100m row reads in \\~4ms on my consumer laptop)*\n* **Automatic 64-byte alignment** *(avoiding SIMD penalties and runtime checks)*\n* `.to_polars()` and `.to_arrow()` built-in\n* Rayon parallelism\n* **Full FFI** via Arrow C Data Interface\n* **Extensive documentation**\n\n# Trade-offs:\n\n* **No nested types** *(List, Struct)* or other exotic Arrow types at this stage\n* **Full connector ecosystem** requires \\`.to\\_arrow()\\` bridge to Apache Arrow *(compile-time cost: 30–60s)* . *Note: IPC and Parquet are directly supported in Lightstream.*\n\n# Outcome:\n\n* **Fast, lean, and clean** – rapid iteration velocity\n* **Compatible**: Uses Arrow memory layout and ecosystem-pluggable\n* **Composable**: use only what’s necessary\n* **Performance** **without penalty** (compile times! Obviously Arrow itself is an *outstanding ecosystem*).\n\n# Where Minarrow fits:\n\n* **Ultra-performance data pipelines**\n* **Embedded system and** **polyglot** **apps**\n* **SIMD compute**\n* **Live streaming**\n* **HPC** and low-latency workloads\n* MIT Licensed\n\n# Open-Source sister-crates:\n\n* **Lightstream**: Native streaming with Tokio, for building custom wire formats and minimising memory copies. Includes SIMD-friendly async readers and writers, enabling direct SIMD-accelerated processing from a memory-mapped file.\n* **Simd-Kernels**: 100+ SIMD and standard kernels for statistical analysis, string processing, and more, with an extensive set of univariate distributions.\n* You can find these on crates-io or my GitHub.\n\nRust is still developing in the Data Engineering ecosystem, but if your work touches high-performance data pipelines, Arrow interoperability, or low-latency data systems, hopefully this will resonate.\n\nWould love your feedback.\n\nThanks,\n\nPB\n\n  \n**Github**: [https://github.com/pbower/minarrow](https://github.com/pbower/minarrow)",

For validation, I’ve already checked things like row counts, null values, duplicates, and distributions to make sure the transformations are consistent and nothing important was lost.\n\nHowever, it has to be peer reviewed by a frontend developer who suggested that the “best” validation test is to compare the calculated metrics (like column totals) against the uncleaned/preprocessed dataset. Note that I did suggest a threshold or margin to flag discrepancies but they refused. The sourced data is incorrect to begin with because of inconsistent data values and now thats being used to validate the pipeline.\n\nThat doesn’t seem right to me, since the whole purpose of cleaning is to fix inconsistencies and remove bad data — so the totals will naturally differ by some margin.\nIs this a common practice, or is there a better way I can frame the validation I’ve already done to show it’s solid.

        "content": "Hey folks 👋\n\nWe’ve been working on a project that involves aggregating **structured + unstructured data** from multiple platforms — think e-commerce marketplaces, real estate listings, and social media content — and turning it into actionable insights.\n\nOur biggest challenge was **designing a pipeline that could handle messy, dynamic data sources at scale**. Here’s what worked (and what didn’t):\n\n**1. Data ingestion**\n- Mix of **official APIs**, **custom scrapers**, and **file uploads (Excel/CSV)**.\n- APIs are great… until rate limits kick in.\n- Scrapers constantly broke due to DOM changes, so we moved towards a modular crawler architecture.\n\n**2. Transformation & storage**\n- For small data, Pandas was fine; for large-scale, we shifted to a Spark-based ETL flow.\n- Building a schema that supports both **structured fields** and **text blobs** was trickier than expected.\n- We store intermediate results to S3, then feed them into a Postgres + Elasticsearch hybrid.\n\n**3. Analysis & reporting**\n- Downstream consumers wanted dashboards and visualizations, so we auto-generate reports from aggregated metrics.\n- For trend detection, we rely on a mix of TF-IDF, sentiment scoring, and lightweight ML models.\n\nKey takeaways:\n- **Schema evolution** is the silent killer — plan for breaking changes early.\n- Invest in **pipeline observability** (we use OpenTelemetry) to debug failures faster.\n- Scaling ETL isn’t about size, it’s about **variance** — the more sources, the messier it gets.\n\nCurious if anyone here has tackled **multi-platform ETL** before:\n- Do you centralize all raw data first, or process at the edge?\n- How do you manage scraper reliability at scale?\n- Any tips on schema evolution when source structures are constantly changing?\n",

It does not yet incorporate lakehouse philosophie/ tools/ data formats for example. The one I’m working on it is more or less a managed spark cluster with many managed niche industry data source connectors.\nAlso, we are early adopters of this data platform but it has been showing a consistent growth signs, for example Aramco is investing on them and is starting to be used by big oil and gas actors.\n\nI want to get your opinion on this situation, and whether you encountered a similar one and what did you do? do you think it’s a good thing to continue working and growing inside my company around this niche data platform or should I get more closer to databricks projects (my company is a big one and some projects are using databricks but much smaller projects with less impact )\n\nThank you!\n\n\n",

Or the OLTP part of the system needs it? If yes, for what purpose(s)?\n\nThe same question obviously can't be made for customer and product related data, since those represent the current state of the application and are needed for it to function properly. They will, of course, end up in the warehouse (maybe as SCDs), but the most recent version must live primarly in production.\n\nSo, in short, I want to know how data that is considered *fact* in dimensional modeling is handled in traditional relational modeling. For an e-commerce, orders can represent state if we want to implement some features like delivery tracking, refund possibility etc, but for the sake of simplicity I'm talking about totally closed, immutable facts.",

I've also uploaded the project to github if anyone is interested in taking a look.

So no API/insert\n\nThe amount of data can be significant, from zero to multiple thousands rows.\n\nIʼm using postgres temp db to store new data, old data, manipulated data in tables, then just create an excel file from final table and upload it, cleaning all temp tables during each iteration. However the new guy says we should just store everything in memory/excel. The thing is, he is a senior, and me just self-learner.\n\nFor me postgres is convenient because it keeps data there if anything fails, you can go ahead and look inside of the table to see whats there. And probably I just used to it.\n\nAny suggestion is appreciated.\n\n",

This is basically an e-commerce store from where users can rent DVDs of their favorite movies and tv shows.  \nThink of it like a real-world product that we are developing.  \n\\- It will have a frontend  \n\\- It will have a backend  \n\\- It will have databases  \n\\- It will have data warehouses for analytics  \n\\- It will have admin dashboard for data visualization  \n\\- It will have microservices like ML, Notification services, user behavior tracking  \n  \nEach component of this product will be a project in itself, this will help us in learning and implementing solutions in context of a real world product hence we will be able to understand all the things that are missed while learning new technologies.  We will also get an understanding the development journey of any real world project and we will be able to create projects with professionalism.\n\nThe first component of this project is complete and I want to share this with you all.\n\nThe most important component of this project is the Data. The data component is divided into 2 parts:-  \n**Content Metadata** and **Transactional Data.** The content data is the metadata of the movies and tv shows which will be rendered on the front end. All the data related to transactions and user navigation will be handled in the Transactional Data part.\n\nAs content data is going to be document based hence we will be use NoSQL database for this. In our case we are using **MongoDB.**   \nIn this part of the project we have created the modules which contain the methods to fetch and load the initial bulk data of movies, tv shows and credits in our MongoDB that will be rendered on the frontend. The modules are reusable, hence using this we will be automating the pipeline. I have attached the workflow image of the project yet.   \nFor more information checkout the GitHub link of the project: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Kartikrast/dvd-rental-data-pipelines)\n\nNext Steps:-\n\n\\- automating the bulk loading pipeline  \n\\- creating a pipeline to handle and updates changes[](https://github.com/Kartikrast/dvd-rental-data-pipelines)\n\nPlease fam check this out and give me your feedback or any suggestions, I would love to hear from you guys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r0uod4ajxcnf1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a85d14e118e455b63bd353d27e53b611c37439a\n\n",

However, this approach (1) impacts the performance because UDFs are written in JS (2) Makes every calculation sort of complicated and limited\n\nI’m curious if there are alternative approaches that allow storing and computing on extremely large numeric values (50+ digits) without converting them to strings or splitting the values into multiple columns (chunks).\n\nAny insights would be very helpful",

It needs to continuously fetch updates, apply change data capture (CDC), and keep the index live.\n\nThat’s exactly the kind of foundational use case my guide covers. I’d love your brutal feedback on whether this is useful in your workflows.\n\nThe approach builds on the Pathway framework (a stream data processing engine with Python wrappers). What we’ve used here are pre-built components already deployed in production by engineering teams.\n\nOn top of that, we’ve just released the Pathway MCP Server, which makes it simple to expose your live ETL outputs and analytics to client apps and downstream services.\n\nCircling back to the example, here’s how you can set this up step by step:\n\n* Capture your data streams as Pathway tables (with CDC built in). [https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/pathway\\_mcp\\_server/](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/pathway_mcp_server/)\n* Define your transformations for aggregations, counts, or joins — they stay current as new rows flow in.\n* Expose the continuously updated tables/analytics via Pathway MCP Server, so other services can query the current state.

Another decent chunk of the grade is ensuring the AI coding tool (Gemini CLI) is actually installed and was used, meaning that if I somehow coded this myself I WOULD LITERALLY GET A WORSE GRADE.\n\nI'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but I'm just so unbelievably angry.\n\nUpdate: Accidentally quoted the wrong class, so I fixed that. After asking the teacher about this, I was informed that the rest of the class will be using vibe coding. I was told that using AI for this purpose is just like using spell/grammar check while writing a paper. I was told that \"[vibe coding] is reality, and you need to embrace it.\"\n\nI have since emailed my advisor if it's at all possible to continue my Bachelor's degree with any other class, or if not, if I could take the class with a different professor, should they have different material. This shit is the antithesis to learning, and the fact that I am paying thousands of dollars to be told to just let AI do it all for me is insulting, and a further indictment to the US education system.",

Too many things I didn't consider. I had to modify few endpoints with few more data, so I digged into the project I don't understand fully, but I found the way where to get those data, how to validate them, format them and send them. Okay, working.\nBut every piece of my code I got to rework. I have to agree, they are right with that and I admit their solution is better, my was just 'working', but not following the conventions, rules and architecture.\n\nAnd I just feel dumb. I ask why didn't I realize that. Maybe I look dumb and they will fire me because I am really dumb and not competent enough.\n\nI have to say, I never pushed buggy code. Always working and fitting the requirements of outcome; always written and passing tests.\nBut never got aproved without reworking. There was always at least one thing to redo better, in terms of consistency, readability or just for a reason they find useful in future while I didn't see it. (Like when they consider future plans of features and they know this detail will become handy in future).\n\nSo maybe I ask for reassurance. Or for warning if I am really in danger and have to improve asap because I am not enough to compete juniors.\n\nJust tell me your opinion or your experience.\n\nEDIT: they are super nice to me, like \"don't worry, just improve it, here is how\", they answer my questions and help me.

There are no test cases or documentation, only vague comments. The variable and function names are mostly nonsensical. Every time a bug occurs, I have to spend hours stepping through the code in debug mode.\n\nHow can I safely refactor code like this?\n\nMy plan is:\n\n**Create test cases**. It's hard to write tests because the expected inputs and code-flow are unknown. To overcome this, I am planning to add detailed logging to the function. The goal is to capture its behavior with various inputs and use those logs to generate a reliable set of test cases.\n\n**Refactor the logic**. Once I have some tests, I can try to reduce the nested if/else statements by extracting logic into smaller methods and using guard clauses.\n\n\nWhat else can I do?

My thought-process is basically \"if I don't know how it ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE VISUALLY, I don't know what to do/type\". It just occurred to me that despite not being exactly a newbie-programmer, I've never really successfully solved my problems myself. The solutions I get is always from EXACTLY copying a sample source or someone else's code. You ever heard of the saying \"figure it out yourself\"? I literally cannot do that; I just don't have the mental capacity to do so. I have to copy, or I can't do anything.\n\n  \nTechnically I can understand high-level concepts to a degree, but at the end of the day I'm always going to say \"yeah.., I get it.., I understand the concept here but....., do you have a sample I can look at?\". I really think there's a certain level of hard-requirement for being proficient at any technical skill, and that is to be able to implement something by actually \"figuring it out yourself\"; for times where you just don't have access to resources like documentation or online source codes, online tutorials, etc..., and I think even till now, I just never met this IQ-requirement. You could even pass me a sample code and say \"see this section of the code?

One argument I keep seeing repeated as one of the cardinal sins of OOP is that its structure encourages statefulness somehow. I understand the difference between stateful and stateless programs, but I struggle to think of a practical reason for reducing states.\n\nA lot of the applications of programming I can think of depend on state in some way or another (Saving and loading a game, text editors, email clients, image converters, etc.), and it feels like there is little to no point in having stateless programs as they would lack the ability to do anything because they would not be able to interact with other parts of the project.\n\nEssentially, my questions boil down to:\n\n1. Why is statefulness considered bad?\n2. How does OOP encourage statefulness?\n3. And finally, why is statelessness preferred over statefulness?",

We started from the basics like logic, algorithms, flowcharts, pseudocode and then moved on to JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and React. On the side, I also learned a bit of Python, mostly basic backend and some data analysis but nothing past tutorials. \n\nIn 2022 I stopped coding for several reasons mainly due to family issues and low self-esteem. I even fumbled a trial opportunity at a company because I couldn’t finish the final project, I felt like I wasn't good enough to do a good job compared to the other ppl in the program; so I just dropped programming altogether and didn't really touch it for years. \n\nNow in 2025 I feel like I’m in a better mental state than a few years ago, but I feel kinda lost on where to start, specially with AI advancing so quickly, I sometimes doubt whether I'll be able to get a job out of it. On top of that, I don’t know where to start since I’ve forgotten so much. Should I go back to basics, or jump straight into a project and learn as I go checking documentation? I'm also afraid I will rely on AI too much and not learn much at all. ",

I was able to code this by breaking down the big picture or question: \"What is Palindrome?\". From there, I went into a deep dive on what it is, and how the check works.\n\nI broke all the steps into small pieces such as:  \n\\- If we are given a string, we need to reverse it. How? Well, we can split the string, where each word will be an element in an array. From there, we can apply the reverse method. Once done, we can compare the original vs the reversed, if match we will return 'true'.  \n\n\n    const palindromes = function (word) {\n      //split the string into each letter, into an array\n      let splitWord = word\n        .toLowerCase()\n        .replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '')\n        .split('');\n    \n      console.log(splitWord);\n    \n      let reversed = [...splitWord].reverse();\n      console.log(reversed);\n    \n      let cleanedString = splitWord.join('');\n      let reversedString = reversed.join('');\n    \n      return cleanedString === reversedString;\n    };\n    \n    palindromes('car!');",

        "content": "This is kind of a complex one, so context: \n\nI'm in my 13th semester in software engineering, about to graduate if everything goes well. I thought I always was good at this, but since last semester, I feel everyone around me talk about things I don't understand, yet my classmates act like I should understand them now. \n\nThe protect for that semester was to build an online app of our choosing in teams of 5. At the start with the theory and project planning, I was really contributing to the work, but the instant we had to actually start coding, I became nearly useless. \n\nThey wanted to mount a git repository, which they shared to me so we all had it locally with our own branches. But I straight up told them I had never done that and ask for help. They just told me to check the readme.\n\nI spent almost 2 weeks trying to follow the instructions, but it was useless, and at that point, my teammates didn't even understand what I was struggling with. I had to ask the teacher directly for help, and he had to guide me step by step to actually set it up.\n\nWith that guidance, I noticed the amount of things I missed. I didn't have it clear what a repository even was (and I still don't tbh), I thought things like node.js and java script were programs that I had to install, I never used cli in my life, dependencies still confuse me, I have never use docker, and many, many more. \n\nMy experience programming was reduced to using Eclipse IDE and occasionally Visual Studio Community. Everything else that my classmates were talking about and using were completely alien to me. \n\nI talked with some classmates at the time that weren't my teammates, and all their advice and instructions were falling deaf to me. To the point that one of them straight up asked me: \n\n\"What the hell are you even doing here, and how the fuck did you even get this far?\"\n\nThey even asked me what does anybody need to program in java, and I said confidently \"Eclipse IDE\". Their faces were filled with both worry and contained laughter. \n\nAll this time, the only things that I worked with were theory, and coding the instructions in a java file. I don't seem to have learned anything else that I should've by now. There's such a gap where I can't ask for help in ways they understand, and they can't comprehend what could I be having troubles with. \n\nI'm doing my residencies now, continuing the work on a project with a teacher as my guide that apparently thinks I can do a good job, and I feel I'm hitting the same roadblock. The protect is in docker containers that I've been trying to get to work for 3 days to no success.\n\nIs this something I should worry about? And is there anything I can do to actually learn things? \n\nI genuinely feel like I should start the career all over again",

I don't know enough and I don't know if anyone would be willing to take me as an intern without me knowing enough.\n\nApart from my assignments I haven't really built anything myself as I get stuck in a loop of \"I need to do this -> I don't know how to do this -> let's check documentation and tutorials -> I have no idea what I am reading or doing -> I need to practice more -> I need to do this\".\n\nPart of it is because pursuing a degree at my ripe old age of 33 was a bit of a rash decision whilst knowing fully well I do not have the mental capabilities for either programming or coding.\n\nI am good at some things in the computing field (e.g. general tech support (especially printers and software) or databases) but absolutely inept at others (e.g. front end or networks).\n\nI know logically that as an intern you are supposed to go there not knowing specific stuff but my emotional side cannot accept this.\n\nJust today, I thought I'd give Oracle DB XE a chance as my limited experience is in PostgresSQL and DBeaver and I felt as stupid in the trying to establish a db as I felt when I first saw a CLI back in 1999.\n\nTo end this ramble, I know what I think I'd like to do but it's hard to keep the job market requirements and self expectations out of the way.\n\nIf you have any advice regarding this or have been in a similar situation and want to share your thoughts I would welcome it.\n\nTL;DR: No TL;DR I can't summarise this, my brain is currently in a state of <mashed potatoes>.\n\nP.S.

It actually released about 2 years ago, but I've been adding new content to it, and due to feature creep and edge cases being added continuously that were not planned for at the start of the project, it's led to a huge amount of band-aids, hard-coding, god classes, tightly coupled dependencies, and code split between classes that may have originally had a single, clear responsibility, but have become Frankenstein monsters over time.\n\nI've cleaned up tiny pieces of code here and there, but I'm at a point where changes are becoming absurdly difficult to implement. I'm wondering if there are any free tools that would be able to help me refactor my codebase.\n\nSome of the features that come to mind as things that would be helpful (which I'm hoping extensions for Visual Studio exist for):\n\n* Being able to move a method or variable from one class to another, automatically updating all references.\n   * Additionally, tools that identify tendencies of certain classes to reference each other and make recommendations based on that to address tight coupling.\n* A tool that makes it easy to compare several classes and their methods at once, perhaps with a way to color code them based on what other classes they reference and to categorize them (such as \"this method is in the right place,\" \"this method might be in a bad place,\" \"these functions do similar things but are spread across different classes instead of being in a single dedicated class.\")\n* Some way to reduce redundancy where two variables do ALMOST the same thing (I'm aware this has extremely high potential for causing more issues and is almost certainly something that cannot be solved automatically.)",

I know the Java covered in the AP class is obviously not enough but I have no idea where to go next after all the material learned in the class.\n\nThe big thing I want to do with coding is mostly just developing apps (specifically for homebrewed devices like my 3DS) but even then I don’t know how to make an app in general. I know app development takes a pretty big commitment to do, but I just want to try even if it’s just on my free time. Another thing would just be making mods on games I play.\n\nAlso another question is if I should just learn a different language like C++, as that has much more use cases (for me atleast) or if something like Java is enough. \n\nSo I’m just wondering what I can do with my knowledge from the class and where to go next.\n\nIf you guys can share some resources, that would be seriously appreciated.\n\nThanks",

However this requires a lot of joins, and im worried its inefficient.\n\nIf it is helpful, i have attached a json style structure of my current setup: [https://gist.github.com/jokerhutt/7ba4bbd85464a4e2f7821494a685ee18](https://gist.github.com/jokerhutt/7ba4bbd85464a4e2f7821494a685ee18)\n\nApart from finding a users next lesson, i also need to figure out which lessons have been passed and which are locked. With my current setup i'd somehow need to mark all lessons with a lower order\\_index in the current unit as passed, then all units with a lower\\_order index in that section as passed, and all units and lessons in previous sessions as passed. For this would it be better to just have a status column in the lessons table / append that as part of a lessom dto for the frontend to know?\n\ni hope the issue makes sense, thank you guys so much in advance!",

I had a lot of visual learning because we had a really good teacher who animated algorithms, and explained it really well. I understood the basics so well back then, and I was able to write a lot of basic code and felt like I had a lot of interest toward the subject. So I went ahead and enrolled to study a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Our college had a really outdated syllabus, and would make us write code on paper, and had horrible teachers. The only thing I really kept up with was math. Right after I graduated, I felt shitty about just barely passing what I thought I had interest in. I moved to the US, and enrolled in a UX UI Bootcamp at UC Berkeley and liked what I studied. Learnt some front end development and got a job at a startup, just to get laid off a few months later. After that, I really fell off the bandwagon and never studied. I feel rusty. It's been 2 years since I got laid off, but I am gaining an interest again to learn. I dont know how much the market has progressed, I dont know how much the field has progressed, I dont know where to start, or what to learn. I learn things best visually. \n\nI want to have a step into the door to learn development, and ML, and backend dev. I want to bag a job soon too. \n\nHow realistic does this really sound? IS there any resources you all recommend? Any ways you have done it? I am terrified as much as I am excited. \n\nThanks! ",

After fork(), there should be two processes with their own logical memory. They will have stack pointer, pointing to the same logical address in their own logical memory. Lets say its x. Now if I declare an integer of 4 bytes, stack would point to x+4, next if I declare a 8 byte integer, pointer should be at x+12. Both processes should have the same addresses for a and b then, x and then x+4. Does this make sense?",

It dosen't give 100% correct code in first attempt but gets there with some feedback and iterations.\n\nI'm becoming increasingly dependent on it for everyday work. I've already given it full responsibilty of writing unit tests, so much so that I struggle to mock functions and classes properly. I'm still writing a lot of functional code and I think that's the most manual work anyone is doing in my team considering some utilise monthly token limit almost completely.\n\nI feel I am not learning much because I turn to cursor when I'm stuck. I do review what it has written but that's not same as googling through stack overflow and documentation to write working code. \n\nCost cutting is on all time high. Company wants to squeeze the most out of every person and so they want more and more AI usage.\n\nAI is not replacing developers anytime soon but it has already changed how development will happen in future.",

        "content": "I am in software engineering and recently there’s a new hire on our team. By our team I really just meant me. We are not a tech company and only need a few developers to work on our internal software.\n\nBefore this new hire there was only me. I’ve done a very good job and have very good working relationship with my manager who isn’t a developer but oversees everything I do. As the company scales, there’s more work. So we hired someone new.\n\nThis new guy is clearly REALLY into programming. It’s like his hobby. Therefore, obviously compared to a guy like me who only likes software development but wouldn’t actively be writing codes for fun, especially after work, he’s more knowledgeable on a lot of things and due to his passion, he’s willing to work 12 hours days when my manager has clearly stated that it’s not at all expected.\n\nI’ve had conversations with my manager regarding him and voiced my concerns. Because he’s treating the software almost like a passion project and is going so above and beyond which is taking a lot more time and not necessary for what we want to achieve. And I’m also having a hard time keeping up with him on what he is doing and why he’s doing it. I was told not to worry but it still has me wondering. \n\nWhat is my move next? Is this an environment that I should try to thrive in? I know that I can never out compete this guy because I just don’t have that level of passion and willingness to give it all to a job when I have many other things in life that I want to peruse when not working, though with my experience, knowledge and work ethic, I have done a very good job according to my manager and he loves me on the team. But with time, I am worried that he’s going to outperform me so much that there’s no point for me to even try to be on the same team with him.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Every time I see people mention it, it always seems like a joke. However, when you think about it, it makes more sense than replacing ICs. Think about it, why do we have so many layers of management in an organization? It's because one person realistically can't keep track of so many people reporting information to them, so instead they have managers report to them all the way up the chain...\n\nThis is where AI comes in. Instead of ICs reporting to managers, they just all report to the AI. Hell, the AI doesn't even need to be reported to because it already knows what everyone has been doing due to monitoring everyone's computers. All the CEO or board of directors needs to do is ask for updates from the AI. They can get very detailed information or high level overviews. No more time wasted on useless 1 on 1s, you just ask the AI how you could do better or the AI will automatically give you feedback or put you on PIP if needed based on a standard set of criteria, so no bias.\n\nThat solves one problem that is faced by large organizations, but how about another one? Think about all the time spent in meetings between managers to only come up with stupid decisions because normally the loudest voice will just win out and it isn't always the smartest. Instead, the AI can interact directly with the SMEs to assess all the information available and make the most informed decisions. Think of the time savings!\n\nIn conclusion, I think we are headed for a time where mid management will no longer exist. A near flat org mostly run by AI will be the most efficient corporate structure and will out compete all of the competition. Boards of directors will be forced to implement this type of structure because otherwise they will be failing their shareholders.\n\nThoughts?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I left my old job a few weeks ago because I was frustrated with the lack of growth and the salary not even keeping up with inflation. I jumped into what looked like a safer and more stable position. The onboarding was smooth and everyone was friendly but then reality hit me on day one.\n\nThe department I joined is basically one guy and now me. The entire workflow is a storm of spreadsheets and manual emails. I realized almost immediately that the whole thing could be automated with a few scripts and dashboards. What currently takes a week could be done in a couple of hours. Which means the existence of the department itself is hanging by a thread.\n\nHere is the catch. To actually automate I would need direct access to the system and that access has to go through my boss. Doing it on my own is impossible without going through him, and going through him means making myself a direct threat to his role and survival.\n\nOn top of that, in just two days of onboarding I was already dumped with actual work, despite only having the most superficial understanding of their processes and tools. The approach was basically “just figure it out.” There is no documentation at all, and to make it worse the processes themselves are arbitrary. One client gets handled one way, another client gets handled completely differently, with no clear rules or references for why things change. It feels random, improvised, and fragile.\n\nTo make things worse the company has its own AI and digital transformation division. If they ever notice what is really going on, they could easily absorb or eliminate this function. Which leaves me in a place where my job is both fragile and painfully boring.\n\nNow I feel stuck. If I leave too soon my résumé will show a disastrous short stay and I will look unreliable. If I stay I risk wasting my time in something that feels pointless and might get axed anyway. Right now my plan is to keep my head down for a while and later reframe the story as “I improved and automated processes and then decided to move toward project or team management because there was no further path in that role.”\n\nI know a lot of people here have been through bad career moves. I just needed to share this because right now it feels like I made one of the worst professional choices of my life",

We are both working under a PE who is leading the project. \n\nWe have distributed the work and at the start I was wrapping up some bug fixes that my manager asked me to complete. The other mid-level im working with is a really nice guy and he is really motivated which I like. The problem is he is almost too motivated to the point that he has just started coding like crazy and in the first week did some of the work on my plate. I've seen him push code on the weekends at like midnight. One time I asked him if he works onthe weekends and he says sometimes he's bored at home and watches tv and code. I politely let him know that we should work together and I dont want him to feel like he did everything. So he backed off some of my stuff a bit. \n\nBut throughout the project, it seems he is going 150% towards any little changes that need to be added. If we need to add a change, he has just added it. Since he has been here for 2 years, he knows which people to go to outside of us 3 for questions and a few times I heard he had a few meetings with people to discuss things, so i asked him to keep me included as well and to give me any resources of people in case I had questions. He has done better of doing that but a few times forgot to send me some useful stuff.  I was gone for a couple days and in those days he made some major changes. Again I think it's great, but now it feels like the whole code is practically his (maybe 70% of it) and the PE has noticed and even in meetings will talk more to him and say (let's call my co-worker mike for the example) \"Mike can you write a note and make that change\". Barely has directed me. \n\nI feel like I have to step in and say \"ill make this change\" or make it clear that ill do the change. I feel like anything I have discovered ill reach out to him and let him know but I can tell that when it comes to visibility it looks like he's doing 90%. He has done more but I think it's more like 60%-70%. I dont think Mike really is doing this to be spiteful or anything I just think he's one of those people who is just really motivated and just starts and doesnt stop. Again, i think that's great and it definetely has kept me in my feet but I also feel like im getting pushed out. \n\nI should say that I got laid off from my last job before I got this job and i think a reason for it was because I was slightly a more passive engineer and I feel like this could be held against me that Mike did 70% of the work and it may look like I was lazy on this project. \n\nHow can I better handle this situation?",

        "author": "BananaBerryPi",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I got a message on LinkedIn from my former boss saying that there was a position in his team and that he'd like me to apply. He said the work is good and the company pays well, and I really liked working with him so I decided to apply because I'd like to work with him again and I've been looking for something with better pay anyway.\n\nI started the process with a interview with HR, than interview with the director of the company in my country, then technical interview with one of the people in the team, another interview with one of the main managers but now from the US. A week after that final one, I got a call from HR saying they want to offer me the position. The pay was way higher from what I'm currently getting (which is very low anyway) and I decided to accept the offer.  I asked the guy to send it to me on a message so I have it written down from them, and that it was an ok for me. He said he'd send the offer letter and that my soon to be manager (who was my former boss) would like to talk to me. I said fine, HR set up an interview and I get a \"welcome to team\" meeting, with them even asking what laptop I'd prefer. \n\nI waited for the said offer letter for two weeks, which during that time I even asked if they needed something else from me because I hadn't gotten it yet and the HR guy told me they were \"waiting on the signature from just one other manager who was traveling at the time and didn't have access to his computer\", but assured me everything else was fine. So I kept waiting for another week, send him a message again talking about starting dates and he goes \"Oh, I'm sorry, I've been laid off last week so I can't help you\". I freak out because wtf and send my former boss a message on LinkedIn saying \"hey, I've been waiting for some time now and I just got a message that guy A is not in the company anymore. Is everything ok?\". He said he'd talk to HR, and I send another email to another HR person that contacted me. This other HR person answers me saying she'll check how everything is going and get back to me (this was on Friday). \n\nSo... I finally get another email from them and it was yet ANOTHER person, and he says he's going to see my process now since guy A is not there anymore, but he informs meet that there was a \"misstep\" in the process and I actually need to go through through another round that includes live coding on Hackerrank because that was mandatory and they didn't do it with me before, so the offer they gave me was not valid. \n\nNow... I'm not sure what to do. I'm between leaving a review on Glassdoor saying how shit the whole process was, that I got an offer, a freaking welcome meeting even and then they were like \"oh actually, forget that\" because what if I'd quit my current job after that? Gladly I waited for a formal signed letter from them, but I could still sue them (according to the laws in my country) since I have their offer on a written message and the email with the welcome meeting setup. Or if I should go ahead and do this next round of tests and interviews to see if they'd give me another offer because the initial one had good pay... But I'm still so pissed at them for the whole thing, it was a complete mess and I'm honestly so tired of doing these long ass 1 to 2 hours talking interviews so many times already... I know they're a real company because I've checked several places and I know two people who work there (my former boss, and another person from a previous company I worked at), but doesn't this feel kinda scammy and all over the place? What would you do?\n\nHonestly, this trying to find something better has been so exhausting... It's either no answers at all, a lot of scams (got offered a \"job\" to pose as another developer while said developer would be working on something else which is basically, well, fraud) or a complete mess like this case.\n\nTL:DR: went through the whole process of interviews, got an offer from the company, a welcome meeting asking me what laptop I'd prefer to then getting an email three weeks later saying there was \"misstep\" in the process and the offer was not valid and that I need another round with live coding on Hackerrank and interviews again.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This isn’t a CS career question, but this subreddit is full of smart minds (please suggest another sub if there’s somewhere else to take this)!  I’m about 10 years into my engineering career; self-taught and came into Disney as a senior mobile engineer, then left after five years to join a big tech.  I came into big tech at a pretty high level role for an IC, which sometimes gets into my head that I have imposter syndrome.\n\nAny job I’ve ever had in tech, I’ve been a high performer.  I got promoted at Disney after three months, highly unlikely because I’m any more skilled than anyone else (I’m definitely not), but probably I spent a weekend on a high-impact side project that was fun and had cross-functional impact, and I’m a good communicator.  I sort of coasted there, but big tech has been a gut punch.\n\nI’m 6 months into my role at big tech and was rated as an underperformer.  Given that I came in at a high level, I have no doubt the expectations were high, but I think I’m doing my best.  I say yes to a lot (often a curse), take on whatever is asked of me, and try to push through learning complex systems and very frequent uncertainty of what I should be doing every day.  I work with smart and very helpful people, but when I hit a technical glitch (often), rarely does anyone on my team have any solution that works, and I end up spending time finding more resources or trying to self-solve until I get it.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve ever been anything but a star performer.  I think I’m letting work for such a prestigious company get to me, but I also think I’m trusting colleagues to tell me where to focus each day and not delivering quickly at all because the systems are complex, ridden with issues, and while people try to help me, I don’t genuinely feel like I’m getting a lot of help or even know what questions to ask until I hit a problem.\n\nHas anyone else ever dealt with this?  I know this is nuanced, but it’s causing me serious anxiety.",

Meanwhile, everyone around me are such hardcore techies. They might as well live and breathe code and its been a massive part of their personality for almost their whole life and those same people seemingly just know the ins and outs of everything, even those not that much more senior than me. They talk to eachother about the high level things, and how each team are contributing towards the environment as a whole. Then they come home and they can diagnose why their wifi isn't working, or why their home security system isn't very secure, all while buiding a cool side project for which they probably wrote every line of code. \n\nAnd I LOVE tech, but nothing like them.

I’m a rising sophomore at a community college in Eastside Seattle, working toward a BS in CS. This will be my third undergrad degree (Kinesiology and Biology, one from a military academy with significant networking benefits). Due to VA and UW policies, I am ineligible to attend UW for CS, either through their undergraduate or bridge-to-master’s program, which would have allowed me to skip another bachelor’s degree. My only option is a third undergrad from another school.\n\nMy concern is employment after graduation. The entry-level CS job market looks tight, and last year I struck out on internships (only Amazon’s veterans program responded, but I was too early in my degree).\n\n1. I enjoy coding and hope to stay in the field.\n\n1. I’m open to CS-adjacent paths (IT, cybersecurity, data science, computer engineering, etc) if prospects are better.\n\n1. Thanks to the VA, I’m financially stable (enough) and could go straight into a master’s after my undergrad if that’s the wiser move.\n\nMain Question: Given today’s market, what’s the most realistic and sustainable path forward for someone in my position?\n\nBonus Question: What should I be doing right now in addition to attending classes to help my prospects?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice.",

It’s based in my hometown, where there’s a much lower cost of living but remote if I want, for $95k. My current salary is $98k. I live in a super expensive city and RTO means I need to be in the office 3 days a week.\n\nI did the calculations and I’d be better off leaving plus my wife and I are considering having a baby so it would be great to be back around family.\n\nSo I handed in my notice but the counter they gave me was a promotion to lead software engineer and $110k.\n\nI don’t know if it’s worth it - money isn’t everything, I’d love to move back home and honestly I’d love to leave this team and all the drama behind!

It’s highly technical, intellectually satisfying, and I get to work on complex problems.\n\nHowever, there are maybe a dozen job openings a month in my country that fit this exact niche. It’s great when you’re in it, but part of me wonders if I’m over-specializing. If my current company pivoted or folded tomorrow, I’m not sure I’d have a huge set of backup options that value exactly this mix of skills.\n\nI’ve also built up more “standard” embedded skills—C++, bare-metal, RTOS, Linux drivers, etc. The kind of skills where you could jump into automotive, medical, consumer IoT, aerospace, you name it. It’s tempting to lean harder into that space, even if the work isn’t always as technically “cool,” because the job market is way more fluid and flexible.\n\nCurious how others have approached this tradeoff. Have you specialized deeply in a niche and been glad (or burned)? Or did you pivot toward broader skills and find it was the right move?\n\nWould love to hear your stories and advice.\n\nThank you.",

Me and several others got on projects that lasted 2-4 weeks because our managers mislead our clients into thinking we were senior level and we told them we weren't when we started working and weren't as efficient as they expected us to be. \n\nSo, there are questions like explain how you used JIRA to collaborate and work more effectively as a team or a time where you used Spring Boot to increase productivity and enhance a service.   I've used both those tools, but coming up with such details of how I improved a legacy system with spring boot or more than just describing how JIRA works, I don't really have anything else to say.  It's just that I've been mostly working on coding skills and creating some services with the limitations of what I can do in a short time as only one person, and I can't give them the answers they want.  \n\nAm I supposed to lie and repeat other people's answers I find on the internet or is there a way to actually get this level of agile experience without working on an agile team first for long enough.  \n\nOne of those projects over the 3 months was a 2 month project where most of the time we were not doing anything because the client poorly planned the teams and 7 of us on a team that really only needed about 2 people with only a few services and very few bugs coming through on them.  \n\nAre there any teams that are actually designing something new or re-creating services requiring actual coding skills instead of just fixing minor bugs that take about 5 minutes or migrating from something like Maven to Gradle?  It seems all we've ever done is busy work on systems that were outdated and didn't learn anything as all we did was updated packages and fixed vulnerabilities that anyone can do. ",

Creating boring tasks every day is simply exhausting for me. I do not change jobs because in almost every software house you do the same thing, and I also don’t want to go through 10 steps of recruitment.\n\nI would gladly work on something innovative, even for less money. The problem is that such positions are only for people with 15+ years of experience, even if the work does not really require it. Either those people were smarter at convincing recruiters, or because of huge competition companies can now hire very experienced developers for the same salary as mid-level ones.\nI think I would probably fit well in a startup. I could even work 16 hours a day, but I would expect an interesting project and a fair salary.\n\n\nIf not innovative projects, then at least some competition for monopolies (like Adobe, or browsers based on engines other than Chromium or Firefox). But it is also very hard to get into such projects.\n\nIt looks like if I do not find a job for similar money (basically scraps, but still a bit more than McDonald’s and with home office), in another industry, then I will not have a happy career as a developer, even if I have enough skills.\n\nOf course, I could try to create my own product and become a founder. But then you need money for marketing — because even if the software is open source, without promotion nobody will hear about it, and there will be no money. This means hunger, and then going back to software houses to build CRUDs again.\n\nAnd this is exactly how I feel: like a chained dog that never goes for a walk, only sits tied up and howls at night. Except the dog at least does not have to work in scrum sprints, pressed by non-technical managers. \n\n\n*yes I used Ai, but just for clarity cuz I write things chaotically. ",

Furthermore, before reading this, some might say \"did you ask for help\", I did ask for help, I met them face-to-face for help, you can say that I'm borderline stalking them right now. The answer I got is \"do some (more) research\" LOL.\n\nI'm an intern, on week 2 - this week - today, I was given this absolutely questionable codebase, the BE server returns from boolean to string to array to json value, you never know what value type it will return and it's a nightmare to navigate because there is no documentation, there is nothing, the only way you gonna know is to print the result out. There is a log system, EVERYTHING is log in ONE PLACE, the tiniest thing is also logged, 1 request = a massive file containing every single log possible.\n\nFurthermore, each request goes through 2 BE, 1 is the BE server and the other is a low-code platform server BE, and ts suck nuts, because this low-code platform has a request limit and the server is running on an unstable docker image so when either of these thing crashes, you don't know which thing crashed because the person who coded this before me thought it was a good idea to return EVERY SINGLE ERRORS MESSAGE AS ONE and there is no try-catch block.\n\nOh yeah, btw, I'm just an intern but I control the entire live production server of this project, this project doesn't have a development environment, I was tasked to research the dev environment + on top of maintaining abomination codebase + on top of developing new feature, I can literally use \\`rm -rf\\` this entire server.\n\nSo, today I was asked to fix a core function of the BE server, this BE server was created solely for this function. I was able to mitigate it by creating more sessions but this approach was rejected because all sessions have been approved by the client superiors and there is no way to change it and I CAN'T CHANGE THE FUNCTION to fix this because the function is \"working correctly\" based on the customer requirements by my lead, mind you guys although I am alone on this project, I do not received any documentations not even the customer/client requirements.\n\nOh and this job is below minimum wage in my country, I made triple being at mcdonald \n\nAfter the synopsis, I have a few questions or I need advices:\n\n1. Should I quit? Because I do have a better option which is an official employee title and a museum gig which I like\n\n2. If I don't quit? Where should I even start because while I have access to a lot of things, I don't have access to other things",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This situation started when my manager randomly re-assigned a project I was working on to someone else. She didn't tell me why or what this meant for me. I wrote up a big document on how to do this, she assigned me tickets from there, but someone else was listed as the lead. I talked to him, and it turned out he had no idea he was the lead of this project. I thought she might have done this simply because she prefers working with this guy, but now it seemed solely vindictive if I was still going to be doing all the work\n\nSo, I reached out to my manager trying to get clarity on what my role in this project was. She got defensive, deflected, asked leading questions, but never truly answered my one simple question: am I supposed to be working on this project or not? If I am, what of the document I wrote, is it still how we're doing it? If I am doing *all* the work, why'd you assign someone else as the lead? She got really frustrated and then eventually threatened to PIP me, so I disengaged.\n\nI went to my skip and talked to him, showing him the conversations. He seemed on my side for this conversation. Since then, I noticed that she had a lot of meetings with him. He told me that if I had conflict with her, I should post it in a public channel. I started doing this when she would nitpick my pull requests endlessly\n\nFor example, I had a storybook instance where I was displaying all the components. She would constantly tell me to change stories, add stories, change how storybook works, etc. Her comments were vague, like \"make it match design\". Neither me nor the lead designer could tell what she was talking about. When confronted about how it \"doesn't match design\", she'd kinda react like \"I'm not telling 🤭\", so I guess I concluded that she was just wasting my time on purpose\n\nSo, I posted in the public channel, which then caused her to come into the thread and act very inappropriately. So much so, I got texts from people (privately) who work there like \"wow what did you do to piss her off???\". At the end, she said to get into a huddle with her, but my skip joined before me. I got in and my skip basically said \"dw we got it figured out\" and I looked at my PR and it was approved\n\nFor a while, she backed off. However, recently I was given a big task to replace every button component across every app with the one from the component library (the project I mentioned before). I did all this, then she left a comment how she didn't like how the button worked. She left no details. She blocked the review and basically said \"button is awkward, go back to the drawing board\". I felt this was solely done to delay me. The button was literally just applying styles to a library (@headlessui/react)\n\nI went back and found the PR where I implemented the one decision she complained about. Not only was it documented in the PR itself, but it had unit tests, comments, and live documentation detailing how it works. It was merged two weeks ago, and she approved it. At this point, I noticed even my coworkers were coming to my defense and calling her unreasonable in the PR\n\nI sent this to my skip and mentioned that I really think I'm being set up for failure here. I showed this PR, but also showed that every PR I submitted was nitpicked endlessly by her while approved by others much quicker. I also showed that she seemed to *only* do this with me, as she approved other team mates PRs quickly\n\nAt this point I'm really lost as to what to do. There is no HR department at my company. There's no team I can transfer to. I'm considering asking my skip to do *anything* to just get me off of her team even if it means becoming a backend engineer at this point. I just can't work with her\n\nWhat can I do in this situation?",

Occasionally, I would use Core Java as and when needed.

I've been interested in and learning how to write code since I was a teenager (currently in my mid thirties.) I've always done little dumb projects for myself, especially after reading Automate the Boring Stuff a while back.  I've picked up a lot of skills in a variety of tech adjacent things along the way: python (django and flask too), javascript, react, typescript, postgres, nosql, a ton of different AWS services (and less experience but still some with both GCP and Azure), cybersecurity, devops, and more.\n\nI'm currently doing freelance full stack development in Typescript and Python, building an MVP of a web app for a client. I've been doing freelance dev work since being laid off last year, and off and on for the last decade. I like the freedom, but I'd really prefer to work at an early stage startup again (as long as their funded properly), but I don't know how to properly communicate all of my different skills. \n\nWhen I apply to jobs, I almost never hear back from places when I play for engineering roles, and I think it's due to not having many actual software engineer titles. Usually, If I'm applying to jobs and not hearing back, I fall back to applying to customer service roles. One of my managers will eventually realize I've got a ton of technical skills (usually because I'll build some tool or automate something), and I'll get promoted, but not usually to a dedicated tech team (with the exception of my last role, going to the data engineering team.)    \n  \nAs an example, at my last job, I started as a technical support analyst and within a month has been given access to their github, prod db, and AWS (early stage startup that wasn't handling edge cases in customer order data, but also wasn't fixing it, so I did.) That snowballed to me building a bunch of internal tools for the customer service team that were previously only able to be handled by the backend engineers, and eventually becoming a data engineer. \n\n  \nAt another job, I was hired as a customer service rep and saw how tedious a monthly compliance report was to create, so I built an ETL pipeline in python (without knowing it at the time) that turned a 3 day ordeal into a 20 minute gut check. \n\n  \nI'm great at root cause analysis, designing a fix, and implementing it (with consent from the appropriate teams). I've never come across a topic/skill that I can't quickly learn, but also have no issue asking questions on things I'm confused about. I'm good at seeing gaps that aren't being addressed that directly effect the QoL of individual workers and love helping make my co-workers lives easier. \n\nI also have severe ADHD, which hasn't been great for interviews. I've only ever had one live coding interview go well, the rest I start to make increasingly dumb mistakes and then go totally blank. I excel at take home tests, but even when I move along in the interviews on those, I end up losing out to someone with a more traditional background. \n\n\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on how I should market myself to stand out?",
