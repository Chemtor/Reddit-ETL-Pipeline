But those are built for Python or Java. That means if you want to use them in a browser-based app, you either:\n\n* Stand up an API to call them, or\n* Run a Python runtime in the browser via something like Pyodide (which feels a bit heavy when you just want some metadata in JS 🥲)\n\nThis got me thinking — there’s still a pretty big gap between **data engineering tooling** and **front-end use cases**. We’re starting to see more tools ship with WASM builds, but there’s still a lot of room to grow an ecosystem here.\n\nI’d love to hear if you’ve run into similar gaps.\n\nIf you want to check it out (or see a partially “vibe-coded” demo 😅), here are the links:\n\n* [Repo](https://github.com/nickBes/meta-sql)\n* [Demo](https://nickbes.github.io/meta-sql/)\n\n**Note:** The library is still experimental and may change significantly.",

Is DuckDB really a database? I saw multiple posts on this subreddit and elsewhere that showcased it's comparison with tools like Polars, and that people have used DuckDB for local data wrangling because of its SQL support. Point is, I wouldn't compare Postgresql to Pandas, for example, so this is confusion 1. \n2. Is it another alternative to Dataframe APIs, which is just using SQL, instead of actual code? Due to numerous comparison with Polars (again), it kinda raises a question of it's possible use in ETL/ELT (maybe integrated with dbt). In my mind Polars is comparable to Pandas, PySpark, Daft, etc, but certainly not to a tool claiming to be an RDBMS. ",

        "author": "QuantumOdysseyGame",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI want to share with you the latest Quantum Odyssey update (I'm the creator, ama..) for the work we did since my last post (4 weeks ago), to sum up the state of the game. Thank you everyone for receiving this game so well and all your feedback has helped making it what it is today. This project grows because this community exists.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is an interactive way to visualize and play with the full Hilbert space of anything that can be done in \"quantum logic\". Pretty much any quantum algorithm can be built in and visualized. The learning modules I created cover everything, the purpose of this tool is to get everyone to learn quantum by connecting the visual logic to the terminology and general linear algebra stuff.\n\nAlthough still in Early Access, now it should be completely bug free and everything works as it should. From now on I'll focus solely on building features requested by players.\n\nGame now teaches:\n\n1. Linear algebra - vector-matrix multiplication, complex numbers, pretty much everything about SU2 group matrices and their impact on qubits by visually seeing the quantum state vector at all times.\n2. Clifford group (rotations X, Z , S, Y, Hadamard), SX , T and you can see the Kronecker product for any SU2 group combinations up to 2\\^5 and their impact on any given quantum state for up to 5 qubits in Hilbert space.\n3. All quantum phenomena and quantum algorithms that are the result of what the math implies. Every visual generated on the screen is 1:1 to the linear algebra behind (BV, Grover, Shor..)\n4. Sandbox mode allows absolutely anything to be constructed using both complex numbers and polars.\n5. Now working on setting up some ideas for weekly competitions in-game. Would be super cool if we could have some real use cases that we can split in up to 5 qubit state compilation/ decomposition problems and serve these through tournaments.. but it might be too early lmk if you got ideas.\n\nTL;DR: 60h+ of actual content that takes this a bit beyond even what is regularly though in Quantum Information Science classes Msc level around the world (the game is used by 23 universities in EU via [https://digiq.hybridintelligence.eu/](https://digiq.hybridintelligence.eu/) ) and a ton of community made stuff. You can literally read a science paper about some quantum algorithm and port it in the game to see its Hilbert space or ask players to optimize it.\n\nImprovements in the past 4 weeks:\n\nIn-game quotes now come from contemporary physicists. If you have some epic quote you'd like to add to the game (and your name, if you work in the field) for one of the puzzles do let me know. This was some super tedious work (check this patch update [https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2802710/view/539987488382386570?l=english](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2802710/view/539987488382386570?l=english) )\n\nBig one:\n\nWe started working on making an offline version that is snycable to the Steam version when you have an internet connection that will be delivered in two phases:\n\nPhase 1: Asynchronous Gameplay Flow\n\nWe're introducing a system where you no longer have to necessarily wait for the server to respond with your score and XP after each puzzle. These updates will be handled asynchronously, letting you move straight to the next puzzle. This should improve the experience of players on spotty internet connections!\n\nPhase 2: Fully Offline Mode\n\nWe’re planning to support full offline play, where all progress is saved locally and synced to the server once you're back online. This means you’ll be able to enjoy the game uninterrupted, even without an internet connection\n\nWhy the game requires an internet connection atm?\n\nSingle player is just the learning part - which can only be done well by seeing how players solve things, how long they spend on tutorials and where they get stuck in game, not to mention this is an open-ended puzzle game where new solutions to old problems are discovered as time goes on. I want players to be rewarded for inventing new solutions or trying to find those already discovered, stuff that requires online and alerts that new solves were discovered. The game branches into bounty hunting (hacking other players) and community content creation/ solving/ rewards after that, currently. A lot more in the future, if things go well.\n\nWe wanted offline from the start but it was practically not feasible since simply nailing down a good learning curve for quantum computing one cannot just \"guess\".",

Let us say it is some kind of transaction data, and the data is stored partitioned by **DATE** (but I might be not interested in filtering based on Date, I could be interested in filtering by Product ID).\n\n1. Now on Snowflake, I know that I have to ingest the data into a Snowflake Internal Table. This converts the data into a columnar Snowflake proprietary format, which is best suited for Snowflake to read the data. Lets say I cluster the table on Date itself, resembling a similar file partition as on the S3 bucket. But I enable search optimization on the table too. \n2. Now if I am to do the same thing on Databricks (Please correct me if I am wrong), Databricks doesnt create any proprietary database file format. It uses the underlying S3 bucket itself as data, and creates a table based on that. It is not modified to any database friendly version. **(Please do let me know if there is a way to convert data to a database friendly format similar to Snowflake on Databricks).**\n\nConsidering that Snowflake makes everything SQL query friendly, and Databricks just has a bunch of CSV files in an S3 bucket, for the comparable size of compute on both, how can Databricks be faster than Snowflake? What magic is that? Or am I thinking about this completely wrong and using or not knowing the functionality Databricks has?\n\n  \nIn terms of the use case scenario, I am not interested in Machine learning in this context, just pure SQL execution on a large database table. I do understand Databricks is much better for ML stuff.",

You can load data from PDFs, transcripts, spreadsheets, databases, integrations, etc., and pull structured tables directly from it. The output is always a table you can use downstream. You can merge it, filter it, export it, perform calculations on it, whatever.\n\nThe workflow has LLM jobs that are arranged like a waterfall, model-agnostic, and designed around structured output. So you can use one step with 4o-mini, or nano, or opus, etc. You can select any model, run your logic, chain it together, etc. Then you can export results back to Snowflake or just work with it in the GUI to build reports. You can schedule it to scrape the data sources and just run the new data sets. There is a RAG agent as well, I have a vectordb attached.\n\nIn the gui on the left is the table and on the right, there’s a chat interface. Behind the scenes, it analyzes the table you’re looking at, figures out what kinds of Python/SQL operations could apply, and suggests them. You pick one, it builds the code, runs it, and shows you the result. (Still working on getting the python/SQL thing in the GUI, getting close)\n\nWould anyone here use something like this??? The goal is let you publish the workflows to business people so they can use it themselves without dealing with prompts.\n\nAnyhow, I am really interested in what the community thinks about something like this. I'd prefer not to state what the website is etc here, just DM me if you want to play with it. Still rough on the edges.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n  \nThanks to everyone who reached out. A lot of people asked for a demo video, so I put one together. It starts with a real use case: a customer receives a weekly report that breaks down feature requests and related metrics.\n\nThis is just one example. What makes this platform different is accuracy and flexibility. There are plenty of polished tools built for product teams (and to be clear this tool is not marketed as a dedicated tool for PMs). We offer the same insights, but without the fluff. Raw data goes in, and you get structured tables or written reports out. You can push results into tools like Jira or Aha, or plug them into your own dashboards, or just query data in our interface.\n\n\n\nIt also supports broader use cases. Need to convert 1,000 PDFs that are dumped in a Google Drive each day into a Google Sheets and into S3 for purchasing managers? No problem.\n\nThe platform supports up to 1GB of data with a built-in vector store.\n\nSo at its core, it is an AI-native ETL engine built for unstructured-to-structured or vector store workflows. We are also working on a simple, center-screen chatbot that gives execs access only to what you choose to publish. Here's the youtube, follow us! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdOKeSq8E4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdOKeSq8E4k)\n\nFYI - right now this is a closed beta. We have a general waiting list.

On top of that, he uses some good taglines in his commercials. At first, his commercials targeted noobs like me. He made it seem like this was easy and they were here to help. What a crock of shit.**\n\n**I started learning SQL (which I found out was free). If you have a question about something you are learning, you are asked to place the question in a slack channel that is provided to you. The question sits there until someone gets around to it which is usually the next day. A lot of the time the CSM (Client Success Manager) would tell you to \"check chatgpt\" or \"Look it up on youtube\". What? Isnt that what I paid OVER $10K for? For you to assist me? Sorry to inconvenience your day. Its hard for anyone studying to come across a question or logic that is hard to understand and just need a quick answer.**  \n  \n**Calls for study would happen but the instructor didnt show a few times. They have been better about that. DEA even created a discord channel and right when people were using it, they took it away. At first they were all about \"Study Buddies\". Find yourself a partner and study with them. Great, so you do that and use the discord but then they take it away. Back to square 1. Studying on my own with no one to ask questions or anything. I felt lost.** \n\n**Then, a number of months go by and we see a new add from Chris. He was marketing different. \"You must make between $150k-$200k and have a couple years of experience OR KEEP SCROLLING\" was the new tagline. Everyone was up in arms. Some guy on the site made a post about it. He called Chris out and everything. He was pretty respectful too. I wouldn't have been. To think they scammed the new comers, me. To think that the job security they talked about is now gone and out the window. What pieces of crap!**\n\n**Then... Python starts and the instructor is insufferable. The course is horrible. Not much else to say about that other than I paid over $10k to change my career and become a data engineer and I have to go buy another course because the one I was ripped off for is absolutely terrible.** \n\n  \n**Now, not everything is bad. There have been some good teachers and mindset coaches. Payal was amazing and she got tired of the place and quit.**\n\n  \n**It would be in your best interest to look elsewhere for your education as a data engineer, even if you are experienced. Dont fall for the commercials.**\n\n**#whatdidigetmyselfinto**\n\n  \n**Me...**",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been working on a command-line tool called nail-parquet that handles Parquet file operations (but actually also supports xlsx, csv and json), and I thought this community might find it useful (or at least have some good feedback).\n\nThe tool grew out of my own frustration with constantly switching between different utilities and scripts when working with Parquet files. It's built in Rust using Apache Arrow and DataFusion, so it's pretty fast for large datasets.\n\nSome of the things it can do (there are currently more than 30 commands):\n\n* Basic data inspection (head, tail, schema, metadata, stats)\n* Data manipulation (filtering, sorting, sampling, deduplication)\n* Quality checks (outlier detection, search across columns, frequency analysis)\n* File operations (merging, splitting, format conversion, optimization)\n* Analysis tools (correlations, binning, pivot tables)\n\nThe project has grown to include quite a few subcommands over time, but honestly, I'm starting to run out of fresh ideas for new features. Development has slowed down recently because I've covered most of the use cases I personally encounter.\n\nIf you work with Parquet files regularly, I'd really appreciate hearing about pain points you have with existing tools, workflows that could be streamlined and features that would actually be useful in your day-to-day work\n\nThe tool is open source and available through simple command `cargo install nail-parquet`. I know there are already great tools out there like DuckDB CLI and others, but this aims to be more specialized for Parquet workflows with a focus on being fast and having sensible defaults.\n\nNo pressure at all, but if anyone has ideas for improvements or finds it useful, I'd love to hear about it. Also happy to answer any technical questions about the implementation.\n\nRepository: [https://github.com/Vitruves/nail-parquet](https://github.com/Vitruves/nail-parquet)\n\nThanks for reading, and sorry for the self-promotion.

What measures or changes will you do in your design so that data is not lost --> I said we will use effectively once subscirption in pulsar and mentioned retry policies, prtiotioning and scaling of pulsar so that when downstream activities are slow we can still handle the bursts via autoscaling of message broker, i even said that we can use scalable components at each stage which will reduce the chance of losing out on these Non functional requirements\n2. What is your reasoning for storing the data post classifcation/tagging? why not store just the raw data --->a.  i said that as this is for compliance we need to retain data for certain amount of time and so by addign this policy we can directly store it alogn with the policy and later daily batch runners can delete the data automatically based on doign checks on this policy. b. I was unsure on this justifying for classificationa dn said on the lines of while policy append happens we simulataneoulsy viia other consumer do the classification as well(I clarified what classification would you folks want me to do and he said simple lassification like classifying this as an email should be good); c. I justified that time-stamp details and metadata must be needed for fast retrieval in case of compliance people ask for stuff and so another consumer does this time-stamp appending etc --> to this i got a follow up question, so as these processes are runnning when do you think storage happens? i fumbeld here and couldnt't answer properly, i said post processing of these three steps and also said that before storing we will encrypt the data and store it\n3. What can you do so that systems are decoupled?  ---> i said we can decouple systems, so that dependcy on external tools can be reduced, for example instead of direct connections to Object store, we can use a Standard API to connect so that tomorrow we can easily replace the Objct store without needign to change the connection much;\n4. What more can we add  --> i was stressed and wasnt thinking straight at this point as the itnerview neared end, so for this question i said we will need more monitoring but i am not sure what the answwer for this is, i asked him clarifyign quesiton on this and he said that what more do we need so that we can sell this product to client, i still dint get it though9focus seems to be on what mroe to be added so that we sell , maybe more features still i am not sure but now i think he focused on beign able to seell, so soemtinng that supports this shipping as porduct but i am still not sure though) and said observability and then interviewer gave floor to me to ask me any questions\n\nhonestly i got stressed and fumbled at times, didnt think clealry at times but i will see how it goes; anywyas i want to learn from this expereine, what do you guys think i could do better?\n\nfor any of these questions i guess i mightve done bad but any better suggestions to these ansers like where i might ve missed looking at?\n\nthis call went on for 2 hours and so this exercise was doen at the end and was tired but this shows i need to practise sitting straight more than 2 hours",

The source DB has both created_at and updated_at columns, but:\n\n- updated_at is NULL until a row gets updated for the first time\n- Many rows are never updated after insert, so they only have created_at, no updated_at\n- Using updated_at as a cursor means I completely miss these rows\n\nThe obvious workaround would be to coalesce created_at and updated_at, or maybe maintain a derived last_modified column… but here’s the real problem:\n\n- I have read-only access to the DB\n- CDC isn’t enabled, and enabling it would require a DB restart, which isn’t feasible\n\nSo basically:\n❌ can’t modify the schema\n❌ can’t add computed fields\n❌ can’t enable CDC\n❌ updated_at is incomplete\n✅ have created_at\n✅ need to do incremental sync into a lake or warehouse\n✅ want to avoid full table scans\n\nAnyone else hit this? How do you handle cases where the cursor field is unreliable and you’re locked out of changing the source?\n\nWould appreciate any tips 🙏",

You can speed it up further with parallelism.  \n\\- Sling costs 3x more hardware resources for the same work compared to any of the dlt fast backends, which i found surprising given that there's not much work happening, SQL copy is mostly a data throughput problem.\n\nAll said, while I believe choosing dlt is a no-brainer for pythonic data teams (why have tool sprawl with something slower in a different tech), I appreciated the simplicity of setting up sling and some of their different approaches.",

The GitHub Actions extension feels clunky and not intuitive.\n\nOur goal is to find a setup that is:\n\nDeveloper-friendly (ideally integrated in VS Code or at least easy to trigger without manual clicking),\n\nNot overly complex (we considered building a Streamlit UI with buttons, but that’s more effort than we can afford right now),\n\nSeamless for deploying Power BI models and reports (models go via Fabric CLI, reports via deployment pipelines).\n\nI know most companies just use Azure DevOps for this — and honestly, it works great. But moving to GitHub was a business decision, so we have to make it work.\n\nHas anyone here implemented something similar using GitHub successfully?\n\nAny tips on tools, IDEs, Git integrations, or CLI-based workflows that made your life easier?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI recently transitioned from a Data Analyst to a Data Engineer role at a startup and I'm facing a significant architectural challenge. I would appreciate any advice or guidance.\n\n**The Current Situation:**\n\nWe have an ETL pipeline that ingests data from Firestore. The source of this data is JSON outputs generated by the OpenAI API, based on dynamic, client-specific prompts. My boss and the CTO decided that this data should be stored in structured tables in a PostgreSQL database.\n\nThis architecture has led to two major problems:\n\n1. **Constant Schema Changes & Manual Work:** The JSON structure is client-dependent. Every time a client wants to add or remove a field, I receive a request to update the OpenAI prompt. This requires me to manually modify our ETL pipeline and run ALTER TABLE commands on the SQL database to accommodate the new schema.\n2. **Rigid Reporting Structure:** These PostgreSQL tables directly feed client-facing reports in Metabase. The tight coupling between the rigid SQL schema and the reports makes every small change a multi-step, fragile, and time-consuming process.\n\n**My Question:**\n\nHow can I handle this problem more effectively? I'm looking for advice on alternative architectures or key concepts I should learn to build a more flexible system that doesn't break every time a client's requirements change.\n\n**ETL Details:**\n\n* The entire pipeline is written in Python.\n* The data volume is not the issue (approx. 10,000 records daily). The main pain point is the constant manual effort required to adapt to schema changes.\n\nThank you in advance for any suggestions",

We ran all our jobs in batch and were able to run ETL jobs where data was in the 100s of GBs in 10-15 minutes. I recently got a new job at a Java Spark shop, and we use the spark streaming API. Our code starts with a foreach, and all of our code base is assuming we're operating on a single row. But then I took a java spark udemy course and it seems like it's teaching the very thing we're doing in java. But we end up streaming \\~20gb of data and our jobs take hours. Now I know we don't even really need to use spark with data that size, but given we have a spark code base, I guess I just have a few questions:\n\n1. Is it normal in java spark to use foreach and treat each row differently, and does the java spark engine recognize common transformations written in foreach and leverage it to create a plan that operates on the larger dataframe in a performant fashion? Is the scala logic of ensuring we focus on Dataframe operations rather than row-level UDFs the same in Java?  \n\n\n2. Is java spark, if written well, less performant than Scala Spark?\n\n  \n3. Is it possible that the streaming part could make Spark less performant when looking at \\~20gb of data? We're streaming data in json format via Kafka, whereas our Spark Scala batch jobs at my old company were using data both sourced from and creating new parquet files.\n\n  \n2. ",

No servers, no drivers, no environment juggling.\n\nWhat Coffy is for:\n\n* Rapid prototyping without infrastructure\n* Embedded apps, tools, and scripts\n* Experiments that need multiple data models side-by-side\n\nWhat Coffy isn’t for: Distributed workloads or billion-user backends\n\n\n\nCoffy is open source, lean, and developer-first.\n\nCurious?

Just validation in your browser.\n\n\n\n# Why it matters:\n\nI designed the UI and contract format to be **clear and readable by anyone** — not just engineers. That means someone from your team (even the “Excel-as-a-database” crowd) can write a valid contract in a single video call, while your data engineers focus on more important work than hunting schema bugs.\n\nThis lets you:\n\n* Move validation responsibilities earlier in the process\n* Collaborate with non-tech teammates\n* Keep pipelines clean and predictable\n\n# Tech bits:\n\n* Python lib: data-sitter (Pydantic-based)\n* TypeScript lib: WASM runtime\n* Contracts are compatible with JSON Schema\n* Open source: [GitHub](https://github.com/lcandea/data-sitter)\n\n# Coming soon:\n\n* Auto-generate contracts from real files (infer types, rules, descriptions)\n* Export to Zod, AVRO, JSON Schema\n* Cloud API for validation as a service\n* “Validation buffer” system for real-time integrations with external data providers\n\n",

There exists mainly two types of data ingestions 1) realtime data ingestion (happening through kafka events-->snowpipe streaming--> snowflake Raw schema-->stream+task(transformation)--> Snowflake trusted schema.) and 2)batch data ingestion happening through (files in s3--> snowpipe--> snowflake Raw schema-->streams+task(file parse and transformation)-->snowflake trusted schema).\n\nIn both the scenarios, data gets stored in snowflake traditional tables before gets consumed by the enduser/customer and the transformation is happening within snowflake either on teh trusted schema or some on top of raw schema tables.\n\nFew architects are asking to move to \"iceberg\" table which is open table format. But , I am unable to understand where exactly the \"iceberg\" tables fit here. And if iceberg tables have any downsides, wherein we have to go for the traditional snowflake tables in regards to performance or data transformatione etc? Snowflake traditional tables are highly compressed/cheaper storage, so what additional benefit will we get if we keep the data in 'iceberg table' as opposed to snowflake traditional tables? Unable to clearly seggregate each of the uscases and suitability or pros and cons. Please suggest.\n\n",

It's a derogatory term used to diminish one-dimensional analysis of upcoming fights. \n\nEssentially just because fighter A beats fighter B and fighter B beats fighter C, it doesn't necessarily mean fighter A beats fighter C. \n\nThis is because fighting style, age, psychology and chance all play a role. \"Styles make fights\" as the saying goes. \n\nHowever, no one has ever concretely proven or disproven MMA math. It could just be confirmation bias.\n\nObjective -\n\nCreate a database that tracks all fights between all fighters. Add weights for fights that occur higher up in rank, fights that happen in their prime and between fighters who already fought each other. The fights will also have meta data like how it ended, strikes and takedown landed etc.\n\nQuestions -\n\nI'm not too sure but I think a graph database would be a good place to start as graphs represents relationships between nodes.\n\nHowever, I want this project to look good on my CV and I know graph databases are not very popular and in-demand in the market.\n\nI also don't know how queryable graph databases are.\n\nLikewise, I don't know where to get the data from.\n\n\n",

        "author": "echanuda",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I started my job as a \"data engineer\" almost a year ago. The company I work for is pretty weird, and I'd bet most of the work I do is not quite relevant to your typical data engineer. The layman's way of describing it would be a data wrangler. I essentially capture data from certain sources that are loosely affiliated with us and organize them through pipelines to transform them into useful stuff for our own warehouses. But the tools we use aren't really the industry standard, I think?\n\nI mostly work with Python + Polars and whatever else might fit the bill. I don't really work with spark, no cloud whatsoever, and I hardly even touch SQL (though I know my way around it). I don't work on a proper \"team\" either. I mostly get handed projects and complete it on my own time. Our team works on two dedicated machines of our choice. They're mostly identical, except one physically hosts a drive that is used as an NFS drive for the other (so I usually stick to the former for lower latency). They're quite beefy, with 350G of memory each, and 40 processors each to work with (albeit lower clock speeds on them).\n\nI'm not really sure what counts as \"big data,\" but I certainly work with very large datasets. Recently I've had to work with a particularly large dataset that is 1.9BB rows. It's essentially a very large graph network, with 2/2 columns being nodes, and the row representing an outgoing edge from column\\_1 to column\\_2. I'm tasked with taking this data, identifying which nodes belong to our own data, and enhancing the graph with incoming connections as well. e.g., a few connections might be represented like\n\nA->B\n\nA->C\n\nC->B\n\nwhich can extrapolate to incoming connections like so\n\nB<-A\n\nB<-C\n\nA<-C\n\nWell, this is really difficult to do, despite the theoretical simplicity. It would be one thing if I just had to do this once, but the dataset is being updated daily with hundreds of thousands of records. These might be inserts, upserts, or removals. I also need to produce a \"diff\" of what was changed after an update, which is a file containing any of the records that were changed/inserted.\n\nMy solution so far is to maintain two branches of hive-partitioned directories - one for outgoing edges, the other for incoming edges. The data is partitioned on a prefix of the root node, which ends up making it workable within memory (though I'm sure the partition sizes are skewed for some chunks, the majority fall under 250K in size). Updates are partitioned on the fly in memory, and joined to the main branches respectively. A diff dataframe is maintained during each branch's update, which collects all of the changed/inserted records. This entire process takes anywhere from 30 minutes - 1 hour depending on the update size. And for some reason, the reverse edge updates take 10 times as long or longer (even though the reverse edge list is already materialized and re-used for each partition merge). As if it weren't difficult enough, a change is also reflected whenever a new record is deemed to \"touch\" one of our own. This requires integrating our own data as an update across both branches, which simply determines if a node has one of our IDs added. This usually adds a good 20 minutes, with a grand total maximum runtime of 1.3 hours.\n\nMy team does not work in a conventional sense, so I can't really look to them for help in this matter. That would be a whole other topic to delve into, so I won't get into it here. Basically I am looking here for potential solutions. The one I have is rather convoluted (even though I summarized it quite a bit), but that's because I've tried a ton of simpler solutions before landing on this. I would love some tutelage from actual DE's around here if possible. Note that cloud compute is not an option, and the tools I'm allowed to work with can be quite restricted. But please, I would love any tips for working on this. Of course, I understand I might be seeking unrealistic gains, but I wanted to know if there is a potential for optimization or a common way to approach this kind of problem that's better suited than what I've come up with.",

Not gonna pretend I know everything - I'm only mid-senior myself, but here's what I've picked up from both sides of the fence.\n\n**Stop obsessing about languages**\n\nEveryone's like \"which language should I learn???\" and tbh it doesn't matter that much. Just pick one that seems cool and focus on getting comfortable with the basics - functions, loops, etc until you don't have to think about syntax. Then grab a web framework for whatever langauge you picked and build some actual stuff.\n\nJS is probably the easiest recommendation since it works in browsers, handles JSON without extra headaches, and you can make UIs right away. I personally like TypeScript these days cuz it catches my dumb mistakes, but I started with Python. My team at work uses Go for backend stuff and I'm still learning it lol. Languages are just tools.\n\n**What companies acutally look for**\n\nI've been on both sides of interviews and helped with hiring at my last company. Gonna be real - the worst junior devs aren't the ones who don't know stuff, its the ones who don't improve fast enough.\n\nYour starting point matters way less than how quick you pick things up. What I care about when interviewing juniors isn't what you know right now - it's how fast you'll become usful and how much babysitting you're gonna need. Being able to read documentation and understand existing code is honestly MORE valuable than writing it perfectly from scratch.\n\nOne of the best devs I know beat me at Chess after only reading about strategy for a few days. Same energy - they can just absorb new info super quick.\n\n**Portfolio stuff - simpler than you think**\n\nOne legit project that YOU built (not copy/pasting a tutorial) beats a dozen generic portfolio projects. I need someone who can solve problems when stuff breaks, and personal projects show me you've actually dug yourself out of holes.\n\nIf you're stuck on what to build - thats kinda a warning sign tbh. You should want to build SOMETHING. Clone spotify. Make a task app that doesn't suck. Build that game idea. What did you think would be cool before you realized coding is hard af?\n\nAs for how big the project should be - there's no magic answer. You should feel like you've made something that works, or that you're proud of parts of your code, or that you've fixed enough annoying bugs that you've learned some real lessons.\n\n**Find ppl who get it**\n\nYou need someone who'll help keep you going, but they can't push you - that's on you. A decent mentor answers questions and helps when you're stuck, but YOU gotta stay motivated til things click.\n\nStack overflow and reddit are fine but sometimes u need someone who gets YOUR specific confusion. Don't be afraid to ask stuff that seems stupid - I asked sooo many dumb questions when I started (and still do in our team slack lol). Learning to code is legit painful, but it does get better!\n\nI was stunned when i started mentoring how many questions are so context-specific that googling just doesn't help. Like sometimes you just need a human to explain something in YOUR terms.\n\n**Just. Pick. Something**\n\n\"People keep saying mixed things about X\" is something I hear ALL the time. But mixed reviews just mean nothing is perfect - welcome to programming lol. Try like 2-3 options for a day each and then just commit to one. Don't feel like you have to finish every udemy course - I've prob completed like 3 out of the 20 I've bought because I usually get what I need halfway thru.\n\nEvery \"wrong\" choice actually makes you better in the long run. I started with Django bcuz I thought I wanted to be a python dev, then moved to Node, then React, and now I'm doing Go microservices. None of it was wasted time.\n\nAlso don't worry about frameworks changing or whatever. Once you know one, picking up others is 10x easier.\n\n**The secret sauce**\n\nConsistency > motivation. Make a habit of coding everyday, even if its just 30 min. Some days you'll hate it. Some days you'll love it. But your brain needs the repetition to build those neural pathways.\n\nI still have days when I feel like an absolute fraud and other days when I'm like \"damn I'm good at this\". It's normal.\n\nHit me up if u got questions. Not guaranteeing I'll answer but I'll try if I have time.\n\nEdit 1:  \nBeen getting a bunch of dмs with similar questions — I’ll write small posts on Medium / [Substack](http://typedweekly.com) so it’s easier to share in next days.",

Some of the local/global style sheets I couldn't figure out where they were applicable to other components until further digging. \n\nAnd then there was the issue of the UI library itself and it's own self-imposed CSS rules. I wrote what felt like the most ridiculously specific selectors just update some simple component UI because otherwise, nothing worked. \n\n  \nHonestly, if I could've just coded it in bare HTML/CSS/JS, it probably would've taken 30 minutes at max. Instead, it took me half a day. Am I just really slow?",

For someone just starting their programming journey now, what would you recommend they focus on?\n\n\n\nSome specific questions I'm wondering about:\n\n\n\n\\- Are traditional fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, etc.) still as crucial when AI can handle a lot of implementation?\n\n\\- Which programming languages or technologies seem most future-proof right now?\n\n\\- What soft skills or ways of thinking are becoming more important as the technical barriers lower?\n\n\\- How should new programmers approach learning alongside AI tools rather than competing with them?\n\n\n\nI'd love to hear from both experienced developers and fellow newcomers about what you think will matter most going forward. What are you focusing your learning on, and what gaps do you see in the current market?\n\n\n\nThanks for any insights!",

Dynamic typing does not even serve its own special purpose. You want polymorphism: use inheritance. You want a beginner-friendly language: well then why would you abstract away something as important as data types. Why does dynamic typing exist?",

Visualizing how they behave in memory made stuff like recursion and pointers suddenly make sense. I also began explaining my solutions to myself, and every time I stumbled, it exposed what I didn’t really understand. However, if you wanna make great progress, you also need feedback to every explanation. I used Beyz for record and suggestions,but there are many similar software available on the market now. You can choose the one that is the most affordable.   \n\nLater, I tried re-implementing basic structures in 3 different languages, Python, JavaScript, and Java, just to separate concept from syntax. It helped a ton.\n\nNow, I spend more time on *why* a solution works than memorizing *what* the solution is. It feels slower, but it’s way more durable.\n\nAnyone else go through this shift?

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm a CS student who's really into metacognition and how people learn programming. I get to see lots of students at university and talk with them about their code (sometimes JavaScript), and I've noticed something that I think is a huge problem.\n\nThe fundamental concept that causes the most trouble for beginners is that **they don't understand evaluation** \\- what it actually means to evaluate an expression until it becomes a value.\n\nPeople always say universities are rigorous and full of definitions, but they (or at least my university) seem to completely fail at teaching the definitions that actually matter. I can't count how many friends have told me that programming suddenly \"clicked\" once they understood these basic definitions:\n\n* **Value**: an expression that evaluates to itself\n* **Evaluation**: transforming an expression, step by step, into a value\n\nOnce you get this, everything else builds naturally. Assignment makes sense because it's basically a function that takes two arguments: a name and a value. If there's an expression on the right side, you have to evaluate it first, step by step. Functions only accept values, so arguments have to be evaluated first - boom, functional composition becomes way easier to understand. and same for functions calls, because the student start seeing the call as an operator that takes a function on its left, not just syntax to memorize.\n\nLater when you study first-class functions, a statement like \"functions are values\" actually makes sense. Students start asking the right questions: \"But what kind of value? How does it look?\" And that naturally leads to closures and understanding that the value contains a reference to the environment where the function was defined.\n\nHere's the thing - I truly believe understanding these basic concepts early helps students ask the right questions. When they face something unexpected with a new expression, the first thing they think is \"How does this evaluate? There must be some evaluation rules.\"\n\nI think all CS 101 classes should start with (or at least teach at some points) these fundamentals: evaluation, values, the difference between statements and expressions, etc. Instead we get thrown into syntax and algorithms without understanding what's actually happening under the hood.  \nWhat do you think?  \nEdit: I wrote [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1mlnc7i/comment/n7ti6se/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) explaining what I meant by evaluation with an example, I think it might help",

I just feel very disappointed.\n\nI had been sick for a week now and I have not done any programming, I had a interview today where I was asked to write the code to find larger number in a list and print the prime numbers in a list. I know that I have solved them before but I just could not solve them . It feels like coding is not for me but I like to code. I dont know why is it happening . \n\nIs there any way I can get good at coding or is it just not for me. Thanks for reading and any help will be appreciated.",

So i was mostly stumbling through the 3 years, managing to get where i am with hope and prayers. The teachers said how they are teaching us the basics and how to learn to learn (their words).   \n  \nSo i am asking for any advice how and where to learn. Those who have experience and learned online through forums and sites, what do you recommend? How did you memorize the important bits, how did you start understanding it, any tricks how to be better at programming, what learning technique could be applied to learning different languages and so on... We learned some c++ and python, but mostly c#, xml, php. In my free time i've focused mostly on javascript, html and css since i'm interested in making websites and web applications. Let's say i'm a noob with basic knowledge, what would you recommend? Got 1 year before i need to look for a job and alot of free time.",

Now- I want a job in CS. Back in school, I wasn’t a strong coder, and I’ve forgotten pretty much everything (I tried re-learning Python, and it felt completely new, like the knowledge didn’t \"bounce back\"). I have no CS work experience, no internships, or anything professional under my belt. I’m honestly lost on where to start.\n\nI've taken time off and I can dedicate 8 hours a day, Monday through Friday, to learning until December to- as they say- \"figure my life out\" and \"get my shit together.\" I need a clear, up-to-date path that won’t lead me to dead ends. My husband and I are fortunate to make this sacrifice (I currently work as an elementary school teacher(long story), but I’m terrified of wasting time. I’m worried that come November, when I’m ready to apply for jobs, I’ll realize I focused on the wrong things and I’m still unprepared.\n\nI’ve done some research online, but it feels like staring into a void. I see posts about people with 5+ years of experience struggling to get jobs and others saying there’s no way a newbie like me will land a role.   \n\n\nAny advice on how to approach this? \n\nWhat should I do for the next 4 months to be job-ready by December? \n\nAny specific field that's more fruitful than the rest?\n\nI was thinking of doing **AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate** certificate - however I read it's impossible to land a job without experience in the workforce. \n\nI was thinking of doing iOS- but again - the competition is cut throat- truly im at such a loss. I don't even know why I got a Computer Science degree- it seems so obsolete. ",

Codefinity’s step-by-step lessons were great for breaking down concepts into manageable chunks, and I found the small projects really helpful for practicing what I learned.\n\n\n\nThat said, it’s not perfect some parts felt slow, and if you’re already confident with basics, you might find it a bit repetitive. Still, it gave me the structure and confidence to move from “I know Python syntax” to actually building things I can show.\n\n\n\nFor those interested, my goal is to eventually work in robotics, and I’ve been using a Raspberry Pi alongside the course to try out small hardware projects. The combination has been helpful to connect coding with real-world applications.\n\n\n\nI’d love to hear from others who’ve tried Codefinity did it help you move forward?

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been noticing something interesting in the tech world lately: it seems like **Java** for the backend and **React** for the frontend are everywhere! I see so many job postings and new projects built with this combination. I'm really curious to hear your thoughts on why this happens.\n\nIs it simply because they're a \"safe\" and established choice? Are there specific technical advantages that make them so popular, or is it a kind of self-perpetuating cycle where everyone learns them because they're popular, which in turn makes them more popular?\n\nOn a related note, this got me thinking about languages that were once super popular but have since fallen out of favor. For example, **PHP** used to be huge, powering a massive chunk of the web. What do you think led to its decline in popularity compared to other options? Was it a lack of features, performance issues, or did other languages just innovate faster?\n\nI'd love to hear your insights and experiences! No wrong answers here, just genuinely curious about the community's perspective. Thanks in advance!",

I got into an internship (called FTT) where I was placed in a project as a backend developer — but there wasn’t much onboarding or guidance.\n\nThe project is a WhatsApp chatbot (not AI-based, just a menu tree of questions and answers to help students with common doubts about our university). The second part is a dashboard for professors to interact with “tickets” — messages from students that the bot couldn’t handle.\n\nAt first, I was excited and learned a lot. I got exposed to things like databases, HTTP requests, backend frameworks, APIs… way more than I ever saw in class. But now I’m stuck. I don’t know what the next step is. I’m just staring at the codebase and feeling completely lost.\n\nTo make things worse, the “client” (university professors) barely show up to clarify things. We don’t know what API to use for WhatsApp integration, and we’re not even sure if we’ll get access to a real number to test the bot properly.\n\nWe had about a month of vacation, and during that time, I started learning Java. It felt cool — I like how structured it is. But despite that, I still feel like I don’t know how to code. I feel like I’m just copying code, Googling everything, and faking my way through things. I don’t feel like a “real” dev. Sometimes I feel like a fraud.\n\nI know this is all part of learning, but it’s hard not to feel lost or like I’m falling behind.\n\nHas anyone else been through something like this? Any advice on how to push through this kind of block?",

Thus my apprehension. \n\nIs that good advice?\n\nBeing on this sub made me realize it’s okay to mess up a bit! I enjoy the puzzle solving aspect of it \n\nThanks in advance! \n\n\n",

        "content": "https://inventwithpython.com/blog/leap-of-faith.html\n\nI've written a short tutorial about what exactly the vague \"leap of faith\" technique for writing recursive functions means, with factorial and permutation examples. The code is written in Python.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n1. Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.\n2. Next, implement the base case.\n3. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.\n4. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.\n5. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.\n\nI also go into why so many other tutorials fail to explain what \"leap of faith\" actually is and the unstated assumptions they make. There's also the explanation for the concept that ChatGPT gives, and how it matches the deficiencies of other recursion tutorials.\n\nI also have this absolutely demented (but technically correct!) implementation of recursive factorial:\n\n    def factorial(number):\n        if number < 0: raise Exception('number must be a positive integer')\n        if number % 1 != 0: raise Exception('number must be an integer')\n\n        if number == 100:\n            # BASE CASE\n            return 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000\n        elif number < 100:\n            # RECURSIVE CASE\n            return factorial(number + 1) // (number + 1)\n        else:\n            # ANOTHER RECURSIVE CASE\n            return number * factorial(number - 1)",

        "author": "YangLorenzo",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone! 👋\n\nI'm excited to announce **WallpaperSwitcher 3.0**, the latest release of my first actually useful C# WinForms project!\n\n#### What is WallpaperSwitcher?\n\nA minimal, fast, and practical desktop wallpaper switcher for Windows (8/10/11), written in C# with WinForms and .NET 9. It allows you to manage wallpaper folders and switch wallpapers with ease—ideal for those who prefer static wallpapers and want something simpler than Wallpaper Engine.\n\n**Core Features**:\n* **Next wallpaper**: Switch wallpapers with a click.\n* **Folder management**: Add, remove, or switch between wallpaper folders.\n* **Hotkey support**: Assign hotkeys to switch wallpapers or folders quickly.\n* **Startup support**: Enable launch on Windows startup.\n* **System tray support**: Runs in the background with tray icon support—hotkeys still work.\n* **Settings UI**: Easily manage folders, hotkeys, and other settings via a dedicated window.\n* **Two wallpaper switch modes**:\n  * **Native Mode**: Uses Windows SlideShow API (smoother but slower switching).\n  * **Custom Mode**: Direct wallpaper setting via Win32 API (faster, emulates slideshow behavior).\n\n#### Why I built this\n\nAs a long time **Wallpaper Engine** user, I started growing tired of dynamic wallpapers high power usage, choppy animations during frequent `Alt + Tab`, and lack of portability made me look for alternatives. I began using static wallpapers manually and realized I didn’t need all those extra features. I just wanted a fast, reliable wallpaper switcher and so I built one.\n\nOriginally considered WPF, WinUI 3, or even Avalonia, but chose **WinForms** for its simplicity and low learning curve. I was able to build a working prototype in just a few hours after watching some tutorials and reading Microsoft docs.\n\n--- \n\n**What’s new in 3.0.0**\n\n* ✅ Full settings UI (no more editing config files manually!)\n* ✅ Hotkey system\n* ✅ Dual wallpaper switch modes: Native vs Custom\n* ✅ Better folder switching logic\n* ✅ System tray + auto-start support\n* ✅ UI improved using hand-written `.Designer.cs` (more on that below 👇)\n\n---\n\n**About the UI**\n\nI initially relied on Visual Studio’s WinForms Designer. But I wanted a cleaner, more modern look—something like Java Swing’s *FlatLaf*. I couldn’t find a suitable theming library for WinForms, so I turned to AI assisted code transformation.\n\nI uploaded my `*.Designer.cs` files and asked AI to refactor the UI styling. After several iterations, I got a design I was happy with. The catch? The updated UI broke Designer compatibility in Visual Studio so now I maintain the UI purely via code. It’s a tradeoff, but acceptable for a mostly stable project.\n\n---\n\n**Architecture decisions**\n\n* **Two-project structure**:\n\n  * `WallpaperSwitcher.Core`: Logic layer (hotkeys, folder mgmt, wallpaper APIs).\n  * `WallpaperSwitcher.Desktop`: UI layer (WinForms).\n* Started with `DllImport + SystemParametersInfo`, later switched to `LibraryImport` for better AOT support.\n* Eventually migrated all native API calls to **[CsWin32](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32)**. This made the code much cleaner and easier to manage—highly recommended if you deal with Windows APIs.\n\n---\n\n**Tech stack**\n\n* C# (.NET 9)\n* WinForms\n* CsWin32 (for Windows API interop)\n* Visual Studio + Rider (design/code split)\n\n---\n\n📦 **Project & Source Code**\n👉 GitHub: [https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher](https://github.com/lorenzoyang/WallpaperSwitcher)\n\nAny feedback, suggestions, or code critiques would be super appreciated. I'm still learning C# and desktop development in general, and I’ve learned **a ton** during this project—especially around COM interop, hotkey registration, and Windows APIs.\n\nThank you all for reading! 🙏\nIf you’re someone like me who just wants a simple, no bloat wallpaper switcher give it a try!\n",

        "content": "I guess it's more of a productivity question. Often times, I find myself wanting to build multiple projects, contribute to existing ones, or learn new technologies. The problem is I can only focus on one task at a time. These tasks usually require deep focus, making it impossible to effectively switch between them.\n\nFor example, I have a couple of pet projects, and when I return to either of them to make some changes, it always feels like starting from scratch - learning the codebase again, figuring out the code logic. Every time.  \n  \nAnother example is coding in different languages. If I spend some time with one language or framework, it inevitably leads to forgetting stuff from other languages, and when I switch them, I usually spend more time recalling the stuff I forgot than advancing. It feels like an uphill battle all the time.   \n  \nI'm sure some people manage to overcome these struggles, and so I'm asking - how do you juggle multiple projects, stacks effectively, without losing step at any of them? Maybe it's a silly question, but I'm genuinely curious how other people stay productive in these situations.",

        "content": "I am building something where users have the ability to upload images that will be stored in an S3 bucket. To prevent files from touching my server I plan to use pre-signed URLs with some restrictions on file type, size, etc. but I still have some concerns that I am hoping someone could clarify.\n\nI need a way to remove metadata from the images and (I think?) scan them for malware. My approach is to just do this with Lambda and use either a temporary uploads bucket, then run the scans and move to a separate permanent storage bucket, or just upload directly to permanent storage. The part that I am concerned about is that this does not seem to be the industry standard. I have played around with several sites and they all seem to have the same approach. They use a single bucket, and the entire image upload latency is < 5 seconds. After \\~5 seconds the images are uploaded and available via their CDN, the metadata is removed, and I assume they have either already scanned for malware or have queued an async scan.\n\nUnless there is something I am missing, it seems that there is a brief period of time where user content is available via their CDNs but post-upload processing like metadata removal and malware scans have not been completed. Is the the standard approach to just immediately serve images and accept the low levels of risk as a tradeoff for very fast UIs, or is there a better approach that I am unaware of?",

From what I see I think companies nowadays value specialization more than  generalization.

I tried surfing subreddits for similar experiences but always came across mixed opinions. \n\nOverall, I like backend and I’m willing to learn it with Python or Java (my cs classes will be taught in either of these), JavaScript is cool but I don’t think it’s healthy to learn with a tool I’m not passionate in using. \n\nJust a knowledge list of where I’m at rn, I’m very beginner level rn:\n- variables & data types\n- conditionals\n- functions\n- currently learning control flow & data structures\n\n\n",

One of the main reasons is that my salary hasn't kept pace with industry standards, which has made me feel undervalued in my role.\n\nOver time, I've learned a lot through trial and error, but I've also tried to use my own knowledge and experience to improve my skills. Unfortunately, as one of the remote workers in the company, they are mobbing me to leave. As a result, my team pushing me to do tasks like meetings, ci/cd deployments and documentation. Limiting my work but I still do the coding stuff because Im the one who is pushing for it and I dont get any support from my team. It started be like this since last 2 years. First 2 years were great and I learned a lot in those times.\n\nI've found it tough to balance my work and personal life because of work times and getting tired from sitting for 8-10 hours. These has made it hard for me to find time to learn new things outside of work. \n\nI have applied for jobs but I've often struggled with basic development trivia questions because I haven't been keeping up as much as I'd like or memorizing about everything about the technology I used.\n\nIn one of the applications that did showcase my skills was the one I created a microservice from stratch. But after the project interview they wanted me to write some basic code(reverse the string they provided). It took me a bit longer than expected to get it done because I wasnt going to write code in the interview from what they told, my laptop was in a way to show my face which didnt had room for me to write but I managed to write it with some debugging. It wasnt enough for them I think they just declined my application. I applied to here through a senior friend and they thought how did he create all of this by himself, must have got helped which I didnt get any.\n\nAnyway, now I'm feeling a bit stuck and unsure about how to move forward. Despite knowing a lot about project structures and API design, backend development etc... I'm not feeling like my skills are growing as quickly as I'd like. \n\nIm doing some leetcode, hackerrank examples and studying some topics (taking notes) but yet Its not enough or match the criteria for the applications. Sometimes I feel like I cant write code without looking to documentation or examples. And sometimes I cant write it out of my head, I know what to create or write as an idea but the functions or annotations are not in my memory all the time, I have to look for the usage.\n\nI'm wondering how can I make some changes or seek out new opportunities to learn and grow. Im really tired of this loop, feeling like exhausted but need a job for living. I keep learning, taking notes etc but Im still here without moving forward",

        "content": "I’ve been keeping an eye on ChatGPT as it’s evolved, and with the release of ChatGPT 5, it honestly feels like the improvements have slowed way down. Earlier versions brought some pretty big jumps in what AI could do, especially with coding help. But now, the upgrades feel small and kind of incremental. It’s like we’re hitting diminishing returns on how much better these models get at actually replacing real coding work.\n\nThat’s a big deal, because a lot of people talk like AI is going to replace software engineers any day now. Sure, AI can knock out simple tasks and help with boilerplate stuff, but when it comes to the complicated parts such as designing systems, debugging tricky issues, understanding what the business really needs, and working with a team, it still falls short. Those things need creativity and critical thinking, and AI just isn’t there yet.\n\nSo yeah, the tech is cool and it’ll keep getting better, but the progress isn’t revolutionary anymore. My guess is AI will keep being a helpful assistant that makes developers’ lives easier, not something that totally replaces them. It’s great for automating the boring parts, but the unique skills engineers bring to the table won’t be copied by AI anytime soon. It will become just another tool that we'll have to learn.\n\nI know this post is mainly about the new ChatGPT 5 release, but TBH it seems like all the other models are hitting diminishing returns right now as well.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

I told her I was out of town and couldn’t work — which was true. I’ve got four kids and my weekends are usually packed, especially with no notice.\n\nThe following Monday in standup, she brought it up — saying she should have communicated earlier, but also added that she expected the team to step up and work weekends to meet deadlines. I mentioned  I wouldn’t be available the coming  weekend either if that’s what she was expecting. It was my son’s birthday weekend. They worked til  midnight that Saturday.\n\nFor context: my manager has always been happy with my work. She’s consistently appreciated my contributions and never had any complaints about my performance. The only “issue” seems to be that I don’t volunteer for extra work. lol. She’s made comments in the past like she wants me to “see the bigger picture” and help other teams.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, she asked if I’d be available the second weekend of September for another deadline. At the time, I said I should be. But since then, my wife made plans for that weekend, so I updated my manager and told her I wouldn’t be available anymore in case she needs people to work.\n\nShe wasn’t happy and said something like, “I can’t keep asking the same person to work on weekends,” referring to a coworker who regularly puts in 50–60 hours. I replied, “That’s a personal choice. I already stretch my weekdays beyond 40 hours. I choose to spend weekends with my family. If every release requires weekend work, then we have a process problem.”\n\nNow I’m brushing up my resume. Haven’t interviewed in over 10 years……\n",

This will help every industry that's facing outsourcing - tech, accounting, project management, all the jobs that people want!\n\nEdits:\n\n1. We are not taxing outsourcing itself as that's hard to implement. We are raising the whole corporate tax rate and then giving tax rebates to companies that show a large American payroll. This puts the burden of proof on the company to show they are hiring Americans. Harder to loophole this.\n2. This is more like EV/Clean Energy incentives rather than tariffs. It's a transfer payment from American companies that outsource to American companies that hire Americans.\n3. This is not targetting H-1Bs/immigrants. H-1Bs are separate but atleast they recycle money back into the American economy. I get it that PhDs and top talent should come to the US, I am not targetting H-1Bs but rather targetting outsourcing.\n4. Rich tech companies that earn more money will get hit harder by corporate tax rate and thus need a larger American payroll to get credits. How much Americans a company needs to hire is proportional to the amount of money they make.\n5. We are hiring the best. We want to make an 150k American salary = 40k Overseas Salary + 110k in missed rebates. Now that both hiring and Americans and overseas cost 150k, please hire the best.\n6. No extra tax cost to give rebates. The funds come from higher corporate tax rate. It will be a transfer payment from outsourcing companies to ones that are hiring American.\n7. It's a free market, but why do big oil, big pharma, military industrial complex get protectionism but American citizens don't?",

But with 6 YoE, I make under $80k in a top 10 US metro. I'm in the bottom 20% of my pay band. I’ve argued for raises. Answer is basically, \"why should we?\" It's frustrating, but I realize that if I don't have any offer letters as leverage, then they *don't* have any reason to do anything. And raises are now frozen for *everyone* due to federal funding changes. Meanwhile, my coworkers are in the top half, if not top third or quarter of their pay bands, making $30k+ more than me. And don't even get me started on how I compare to the figures on levels.fyi or Glassdoor.\n\nI’ve been applying since I got my 401k vested, which coincided with the job market starting to fall apart. The search has not been successful or positive or encouraging. It's particularly disheartening to know that people out there with actual expertise and proper CS degrees and double/triple my YoE are also struggling. If *they* can't find jobs, what chance do *I* have?\n\nMaybe I am still behind in some ways, but I *have* improved. I’ve gotten promoted. (Even though the promotion just put me at a lower percentile in my new pay band.) I get positive feedback from PMs and BAs, and a coworker recently said he's even impressed with how far I've come on a history degree and that he thinks I might make a good architect someday. Their praise doesn't translate into anything material, of course.\n\nI had always had an interest in tech, but this is not a case of \"I love code, but the bureaucracy is killing me.\" These days, I *prefer* the requirements gathering and backlog refinement sessions to head-down coding. I didn't exactly get into this field as a fulfillment of a lifelong passion. I think early on I felt gratification in helping people *via* the code. But there's not joy inherent to the code itself. Nowadays, my work feels disconnected from real users. It feels like grinding through abstract problems created by the tools themselves. Some days I wish I never had to touch code ever again.\n\nMaybe my mentality would change if I felt like I had a future, even a path to just being a median developer making a median salary. But right now, I don't see it.\n\nI don't think every person is necessarily cut out for every type of job. Am I just not cut out to be a developer? Or maybe not cut out for it anymore?

When I joined, I thought it would be the perfect place to grow, the kind of role where you get to work on everything, learn fast, and wear a lot of hats.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what happened… except now I’m realizing it might be a double-edged sword. I’ve done front end, back end, databases, a bit of DevOps, even some UI design when we were short-staffed. I’m the go-to “fixer” for random problems, but I don’t feel like an expert in anything.\n\nIt’s starting to worry me. When I look at job postings, they want people who are highly specialized, or at least really strong in one area. I feel like I’m a mile wide and an inch deep. Even my portfolio is all over the place.\n\nI like my team, and I’m grateful for the trust they’ve put in me, but I’m starting to wonder if staying here is keeping me from really growing. I don’t want to wake up in another 5 years with the same problem, “good at a lot, great at nothing.”\n\nHas anyone else been in this position? How did you focus your skills and make yourself more marketable without feeling like you were starting from scratch? I don’t want to go back to school…only if this is the only way to move my career forward.",

        "content": "The 2025 StackOverflow Developer Survey just dropped, and as someone who's been tracking these trends for career planning, I wanted to share the actionable insights.\n\n**The Reality Check:**\n\nBased on 49,000+ developer responses across 177 countries, here's what's happening in the industry (not just the hype):\n\n**High-Priority Skills (Proven ROI):**\n\n1. **Python**: +7 points year-over-year. If you're not learning Python in 2025, you're missing the boat. It's dominating AI/ML, data science, and increasingly backend development.\n2. **Docker**: +17 points (highest single-year increase ever). Container literacy is now a basic requirement, not a nice-to-have.\n3. **Cloud platforms**: Still growing steadily across AWS, Azure, GCP\n\n**The AI Skill Paradox:**\n\nHere's what the survey reveals about AI: usage is up, but trust is down to 60%. Translation for your career:\n\n\\- Learn to collaborate WITH AI tools, don't depend ON them\n\n\\- Develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it\n\n\\- Focus on verification, architecture, and strategic thinking\n\n**Technologies to Consider (But Don't Panic About):**\n\n\\- Rust: Growing but still niche\n\n\\- Go: Solid for specific use cases\n\n\\- Kubernetes: Important for infrastructure roles\n\n**Technologies That Remain Solid:**\n\n\\- JavaScript: Still the most widely used\n\n\\- PostgreSQL: Database of choice\n\n\\- Git: Universal (obviously)\n\n**My Practical Advice:**\n\n* **If you're starting out**: Learn Python first, then JavaScript, then Docker\n* **If you're mid-career**: Add containerization and AI collaboration skills to your existing stack\n* **If you're senior**: Focus on architecture and team leadership while staying current with Python/containers\n\n**Career Strategy:**\n\nDon't chase every new framework. The survey shows that sustained success comes from mastering fundamentals and selectively adopting innovations that solve real problems.\n\n**The numbers don't lie**: developers with Python + Docker + cloud skills are seeing the most opportunities right now.\n\nWhat's your experience? Are you seeing these trends in your job search/interviews?\n\nI wrote a more detailed breakdown with specific learning resources.

I had been at the company for a little over 2 years at that point and had purchased a house in October of the year before. The first few months, I wasn’t that worried, I had rented out the house and was also doing Airbnb to keep the mortgage payments covered. I was interviewing and hearing back, getting ghosted, getting reached out to by recruiters. My former company had a career counselor program for everyone who was laid off, but obviously it yielded no success. Winter came, airbnb bookings were low and I really started to feel the pressure. April came around again and I started to just feel like a straight up failure.\nAnytime people would talk about CS (I did computer engineering tho not that it really matters) being a dying field now or just about how horrible the job market was, I just didn’t think much of it because I figured there would always be something.\nI honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I was in a forbearance period for my mortgage but the forbearance period is over and I’ve missed 2 payments. I got a notification in the mail from my mortgage company with a pamphlet about “Tips to avoid foreclosure”. It feels like there’s a noose around my neck. I don’t know if I’m being dramatic. I don’t want to ask my parents (who I live with) for money because it seems like money is tight right now, but I know they would find the money if I did ask. I just feel so hopeless, it’s like nothing is working. I have no money. I don’t even respond to my friends anymore because I’m tired of telling them that I have no money. I’m in credit card debt too from the money I spent to furnish my airbnb. It’s like no one around me can even comprehend how much money occupies my mind. I’ve been going outside in nature a lot more recently and in those moments it feels like everything will be okay but then I get home and I remember.\nHonestly I’m kind of tired of typing so I’m gonna stop here, I guess I just wanted to vent a bit.",

He was muting himself frequently, switched to teams (I could hear his pings lol) and looked like he was asking someone else for inputs on how to get the interview done. The second interviewer was just rushing. He gave a 5 min monologue about the problem statement and dropped two matrices and asked me to solve it. When I asked any follow-up questions he said “Lets stick to the initial requirements?” Like wtf. Moreover they rejected me but they rejected me for a different position altogether but I assume that they rejected me for this position I interviewed for because I know I fucked up the second round leetcode problem.\n\nI expected better standards from Amazon. I didn’t know that they were this lazy and disoriented and disorganized lol. What are your thoughts? Has any faced something similar to this in recent times?",

I’m not sure what his endgame is, probably just to ladder climb.

        "content": "Hey all, I’ve been working as an intern at a small professional services firm since May of last year (so ~1.5 years now). What started as a short summer internship got extended **four times**, every time with vague mentions that I’d be offered a full-time role once \"we finish X\" or \"get through Y.\"\n\nIn the beginning, I was doing analytics-focused work, i.e., building dashboards, eda/reporting for clients, simple regression tasks. It was great. Then, as the team realized more of the analytics was internally focused, we decided to stop client work and migrate our dashboards into the company website. That’s when things shifted. Since I have a background in data science + some experience with full-stack dev, I became the one spearheading the dashboard migration effort.\n\nFor the next 6+ months, I’ve collaborated directly with the dev team, learning React, GraphQL, MongoDB, Docker, Task Scheduling, and D3.js on the fly. It was messy but fulfilling. We were building these tools with hope of scaling them into client-facing tools eventually.\n\nThroughout this, my boss kept saying I’d be the one maintaining these dashboards and owning future projects, especially because I had context on both the data and the dev side. I even got **another** project last month, again with the implication that I was part of long-term plans.\n\nFast forward to now: all three projects are basically done. The dashboards work, the visuals take in prod data, and we’re just ironing out some small aesthetic issues + a rework of some GraphQL logic for one proejct. \n\nAt 9am today, I get a calendar invite for an \"exit interview.\" No warning. I talk to my boss and he flatly tells me my last day is next week (August 11), and to have everything wrapped up and documented by then. That’s it.\n\nNo full-time offer. No more extensions. No transition into another role. Just \"thanks and bye.\"\n\nHonestly, I’m kind of heartbroken. I poured so much time into this place. Took on projects well outside my scope. Built tools that no one else had the technical background for. I **thought** I was doing everything right. My coworkers were surprised to hear I wasn’t being kept. It’s not just me imagining this either. My boss has consistently dragged his feet on giving me a real answer about my future here.\n\nTruthfully, I didn’t even really \"work\"  today. I spent most of it job hunting and planning to use up my accrued PTO before I go. I’m in grad school part-time (1 year left), which I think has scared off a few employers. And it's all starting to sting a bit... Especially since I've grown close to my coworkers and enjoyed the work. \n\nSide note: this is the second time I've been let go. My first job out of college started as an internship but was extended to full time. However, the company laid me off due to budget slashing post-covid. This time around feels very different.\n\nIs it normal to feel like this? To feel like it’s not worth pushing these final 2% of features anymore? Am I being unprofessional by mentally checking out a week before I’m done?\n\nI just feel burned out, a bit betrayed, and unsure of what’s next. Thanks for reading.",

However, I always end up making mistakes that seem obvious, and that end up reducing all my work to a zero.\n\nTwo instances come to mind, among many:\n\n1. I was tasked to create a bottom sheet using a Figma design as a reference. I got too caught up in the functionality, which I did implement correctly for the most part. But the bottom sheet was supposed to show over all the other components in the UI, which I forgot to do. My team lead reviewed the task and pointed it out to me.\n\n2. I created another bottom sheet that was supposed to have a certain appearance in both landscape and portrait mode. I was able to implement it correctly, and tested it in both orientations, as well as landscape -> portrait and portrait -> landscape (or so I thought). Later, it was discovered that despite my thorough testing, i missed the portrait->landscape scenario, leading to the UI looking bad. Once again, an obvious mistake that should have been avoided and pointed to me by my team lead.\n\nIt is a problem because \"needs to get better at testing\" has appeared far too many times in my performance review which comes every 3 months and instances like these are cited to me far too often.\n\nWe only get performance based increments, and because of this, I have never been able to get one, as I believe their perception of me is \"Makes too many obvious mistakes\".\n\nI have tried the advice of \"write down all test cases beforehand\", but as scenario 2 shows, even that doesn't stop me from making errors like those.\n\nI seem to have hit a wall, one that I can't get over.\n\nHas anyone ever faced a problem like this before? How did you overcome it?",

        "content": "I’m a junior studying computer science/data science, and I feel like I’m just drifting with no real direction.\n\nI’ve never done a coffee chat before, never had a proper internship, and while I do like coding, I only really enjoy the simple, creative kinds of coding projects you might do in high school: small, straightforward, “polished but not deeply technical” stuff. The more intense, algorithm-heavy, grindy SWE work doesn’t excite me.\n\nWhat I am really good at is managing, organizing, and coordinating. I thrive when I’m planning, running projects, and keeping people on track. Because of that, the only path I can see right now is forcing myself into a SWE internship to eventually move into a PM role. But even then, I’m not sure I’m cut out for any of this.\n\nI’m also an international student and currently in the process of applying for an EB-5 visa, which adds a whole other layer of pressure and uncertainty to figuring out my career.\n\nMeanwhile, my friends are doing coffee chats every week, interviewing, and already have internships lined up (some are even returning to previous ones). I spent my summers hanging out with friends, doing artsy projects, watching TV, basically nothing “competitive” or career-boosting. Now I’m feeling the weight of that.\n\nPart of the problem is that I’ve had almost zero exposure to what jobs are actually like. My dad’s retired and never really talked about work, my brother just tells me to “focus on learning and chill,” and I’ve never been in an environment where I could see what a day in a tech or PM role is like. Any time I think about doing a personal project, I feel like it’s pointless because there are already better versions out there and mine won’t be “competitive” enough.\n\nI just feel… lost. I don’t have genuine interest in what I’m learning right now, I don’t have a clear vision of what kind of job I’d like, and I feel like I’m already behind compared to my peers.\n\nIf you’ve been in this position, what did you do? How do I figure out what I might actually enjoy and build toward it without wasting more time? Is SWE → PM really the only path if I don’t want to code forever? And is it possible to “catch up” if I’ve essentially wasted my first two college summers?\n\nI’m looking for honest, no-BS but kind advice from people who’ve been here before.",

For the past two years taking coding classes (Specifically on C++, which is my preferred language) I've noticed that in reality I haven't learned anything important or new, most things I see in class are logical extensions to what I already know, or as a fact, things I already know. But in reality, forget about university because what matters is the job. Obviously I don't have a job on the field nor any experience, but I believe that I would be smart for me to start early and have something to show, make myself valuable.\n\nThe problem? I don't know what to do or how to do that, most of what I've coded on c++ are simple console programs. Yes I know about classes, structs, lambdas and all of that yet I lack any important project. Meanwhile, I see all this people on the internet with GitHub repos, working or interesting apps to showcase their skills, and I've noticed that I have basically nothing, and I want to, and change that, I just need some advice on the right direction. So truly, any advice on this topic would be highly appreciated because I feel like im falling behind and someday in the next two years imma be 20 and probably still have nothing so I better prepare for that starting now.",

This job had near impossible standards to meet, so I'd be fixing roughly 10-20 tickets a day every day working \\~7am to \\~5pm. I told him explicitly I can't work from 5PM - 7PM, but could work after that. Despite this, every single time the manager would have a meeting with me, he would ask these questions that seemed to imply I wasn't working. He would say things like \"where are you working from\", \"when did you start working today\", \"how many hours have you been working\", stuff like that\n\nHe tried scheduling a meeting at 6pm my time. I told him, I could not make it to this time and he would have to schedule it at either 4pm or 7:30pm. He took a heavy amount of offense to this and started saying some cryptic stuff about how it's not acceptable that I \"disappear\" at that time. I didn't want to explain to him the reason (why's it his business?), but I had to have this time off to do physical therapy due to a busted hip, which will prep me for a surgery. I simply can't put this off, because it was causing a lot of pain\n\nFinally, I think the \"breaking point\" was one day when I woke up at 6am and looked at my phone to see a bunch of notifications from around 2AM, one after the other, asking me if I was online. I messaged back (at now 6AM) and said I just woke up, was it something urgent? He said it wasn't, but I should have been awake. I was not on call. Anyway, I ended up getting fired and when I asked HR why, they said I \"disappeared\". I asked for any tangible proof and pointed at the github contributions, which were every hour 7am-5pm every weekday. They did not respond\n\nSimilarly, I just got a new manager at my company who seems to be doing the same thing. She's constantly saying I'm not doing enough, not doing the right thing, \"not working\", but when I ask for tangible examples, she will not provide them. To counter, I show an exact audit of everything I did over the past few weeks, which was at least 2-5 tickets per day with correspondence over slack. She still says she's upset by it\n\nThis doesn't seem to help, at all. Like every time I bring up \"actual proof\", it feels like that just makes the problem so much worse.

I even won competitions/hackathons (1st place) for this company. I kept thinking what did I do wrong or what did I miss, and what do others have to get hired but I don't. So many things are going on in my mind right now. I feel absolutely embarrassed when facing my friend or anyone who gets hired. I feel like a failure. I am even scared to talk to my family about this. They have sacrificed and expected so much for me.\n\nI have put in a lot of my blood, sweat, and tears for the past three years for this first internship, and always aim for return offers so my career is secure and stable. I will graduate in May 2026 and I don't want any days or weeks or months of being unemployed. I feel like I am not ready to go back to job hunting again and even grinding technical assessments (LeetCode/Hackerrank/CodeSignal). Just thinking about job hunting makes me a bit scared again.",

        "content": "First and foremost, thank you for even clicking on this. I'm going to lay out my career path, how I got here, and essentially ask for help on what I need to do to get out of this dead end in the next six to 12 months.\n\nVery long story short, one unexpected kid at 20 and I didn't get my college degree until 2019 at the age of 33. It was incredibly brutal to get there but I had a compsci degree from the University of Minnesota.\n\nDespite that, all of my efforts at job fairs were a bust. My best guess was my age was a factor, but I can't know. Regardless, the only job I could get my hands on at graduation was for a local embedded linux hardware company of \\~400 employees for \\~$70k. It was a bit of a tough pill to swallow given all of the guys I studied with (and often performed better than) landed at either Amazon or Target for significantly more money.\n\nI got some moderate Yocto experience and enough C++ to know I'd rather write in straight C than untangle legacy bowls of spaghetti. Covid hit almost immediately after I was hired and my subpar wage dipped into straight up rough territory within a year. When they called me back into the office I said no and flailed to look for a new job.\n\nThat too was utterly brutal. I only really had \\~1.5yrs of Yocto/embedded experience and was still very green. The only job I could find was a remote gig in another embedded device company in Fargo. The pay was $100k. It wasn't great, but it was a raise, and they promised me I would continue my embedded Yocto experience. This struck me as a deal as I could continue to transport my kids to school and work on the same skillset. Id eventually be a marketable embedded developer in +/- 3 years I felt.\n\nIt was also a lie. I never, ever touched anything embedded, leaving all of my experience at my first job to largely rot before I could get it to the magic \"5 years\" point. Instead it was secretly full Reactjs/Swift/XCode/C# userspace server code. I now have \\~3.5 years of that when my company was bought and I was thrown out of that team into a.... yocto embedded team. I now have 6 more months of experience there. Most of that time was spent remembering things I had completely forgotten.\n\nI have been looking for a job to get off this roller coaster since early 2023. I barely even get callbacks. I've gotten two interviews. One was a dud, the other was a trap that offered me $80k without asking me a single tech question. I know this Reddit is aware of the pitfalls and stressors of looking for a job in this field right now so there is no reason to go further.\n\nMy work history is essentially in shambles and looks horrible on paper from all this thrashing. Both companies do not have names that make my resume stand out in any meaningful way. I realize (or presume) that the only way out for me is to work all day, then code all night and create a portfolio in a space that mildly interests me.\n\nI have been working in Rust, which I thoroughly enjoy, and have been messing around in Ratatui crate, which I also enjoy, but work is slow between two high school kids I teach how to drive simultaneously, being the one breadwinner, the one adult that drives, and the one person who does household shopping and cooking. I am too stretched thin to not be attacking this with maximum efficiency.\n\nI need to stop wandering in the dark and find the straightest line possible to get me out of my stagnant job/wage. I came to this whole industry late and dont have either the best discipline or sense on how one furthers their career as quickly as possible and becomes marketable in the most effective way, and I'm up to my eyeballs in all the extraneous \"life\" stuff that is non-negotiable. I basically need a road map.\n\nThank you for spending any amount of time on that. I am 100% serious and have the work ethic, I just don't have the direction. I appreciate any constructive first steps.",

Should I list it under Education on my resume as “Planned” or “Expected”? Or should I mention it in a cover letter or optional section on the application?\n\nHas anyone else been in this situation? I’d appreciate any advice on how to handle it.",

I was a Software Engineer at a major automotive company. \n\nLast year, i spent the first 8 months not working looking for SWE jobs, that didn’t get me anywhere. No responses. No interviews. Just idle. \n\nThe last couple months I decided maybe it’s time for me to make a switch into Solutions Engineering. Does anyone have any advice on this? \n\nI just feel that competing with people who are  extremely talented when it comes to coding won’t put me in a good spot. I’m rusty with coding (out of practice), but I’ve also never been phenomenal at it. An average joe engineer. \n\nI’m just exhausted. Everyday I study something new for a company hoping I get somewhere. I don’t imagine myself doing leetcode questions everyday and studying like I’m back in college again. It seems so unfair. I went to college. I did the work. I have the degree. I want to work and make money. I’m dedicated and ambitious, but that is not enough for this career. I need some guidance. I’m at a halt and feel so hopeless. I feel that my career is going down the drain. I’m in more debt now than I was when I was a teen and working at a coffee shop. \n\nEndless amount of studying for a few interviews that have gotten me nowhere. There’s just so much information in the technology world, it’s overwhelming. I’m at a loss. If anyone has some suggestions when it comes to Solutions Engineering, which I feel fits my personality more, or another job with my degree that’s more niche, I would appreciate the guidance. ",

        "author": "fleethead",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some guidance or perspective from this community. I’ve been feeling lost for a long time now.\n\nI'm 26 and studied Computer Science in Australia (where I'm from and live now) and have always seen myself as a systems thinker. I like to see how everything connects, not just code but tech, people, economic and social systems. I’ve had a rough few years between life setbacks, grief, and demoralising work environments. I feel like I've stagnated and lost confidence in my abilities, or never really developed them further than university level.\n\nI’ve held two jobs since graduating:\n\n* One was an \"application specialist\" role, mostly user support and QA testing - no real development. (1.5 years) \\[Australia based\\]\n* My current job is a support engineer role maintaining legacy WinForms tools in C#. I fix minor bugs, occasionally touch Blazor or SQL, but I wouldn’t even know how to build one of these apps from scratch. There's little mentorship, PRs only get reviewed by the boss once per week if you're lucky, and every other team member is spread thin. (2 years total, with 2x 5 month gaps in between due to multiple deaths in the family) \\[Australia based, but worked remotely for 9 months from London\\]\n\nIt’s been a mixed, somewhat toxic environment. I was the only new person to last longer than two weeks in three years. My boss often humiliated me which wrecked my self-worth, and I find it hard not to feel panic that I’m falling behind while everyone else is moving forward.\n\nThat said, I have done a few things I’m proud of:\n\n* At uni, I had a job building Python software for Raspberry Pi devices (e.g., an NFC security system, e-ink display widgets). I don’t have access to these any more.\n* I’ve participated in two blockchain hackathons (first a team of three which I led/did most of the project, and second I did solo), working with Solidity and JavaScript. Both times something went wrong at the very end and I couldn’t demo properly, but I want to revisit those projects and finish them.\n* I’ve also started writing about cybernetics, AI, and cognitive security/cogsec on my blog.\n\nI have so many project ideas, but I’m overwhelmed. I don’t know whether to double down on the blockchain stuff, explore AI/ML (I’d even go back to uni if I felt it was the right path), or start a new project using something more marketable like React. I often feel FOMO seeing the focused, driven people on this sub. I know I’m capable and think deeply, but I feel stuck and don’t know where to aim.\n\nI’ve also been able to find a few thinkers/leaders online who I look up to. In 2023 I flew internationally to a tech conference and networked with, met and conversed at length with the founders and staff of this company, which is probably the highlight of the last few years for me. This is the same company I did the hackathons for. In my mind, I’m working toward having some diverse portfolio that really demonstrates me and my strengths which I could present to any of these people and ask for mentorship.\n\nSo here’s what I’m hoping you might help me figure out:\n\n* How do I find a path in CS I can truly thrive in, that makes use of my strengths?\n* Should I try to finish the blockchain project or start fresh with something more mainstream like a React app?\n* Is it worth exploring AI/ML or systems design formally? Or should I just build, build, build and let the path emerge?\n* How do I rebuild confidence and skill after years of support roles and a toxic work environment?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would mean a lot. Thank you.",

So I've started applying for jobs. \n\nI take my time and tailor the resume and cover letter to the posting, and I'm only applying for ones that I'm a good fit for. Despite this, I get rejected automatically. My best guess is that I'm being filtered out based on my degree. Even when it comes to posting that say they'll take equivalent experience. Even if the job only requires 4 years of experience and pays less than what I currently make.\n\nThe problem is that I have a family and a mortgage and all that now, so I can't just drop everything and go back to school. I could do online classes, but there's no way I would be able to finish a degree before this company folds. What do I do?",

        "content": "I graduated last year. The internships I applied for didn't so much as email me back so I graduated without an internship. Trying to make lemonade, I tutored my underclassmen and assisted some of the professors with grading papers. Neither of which has really seemed to benefit me in my job search.\n\nThis last year I had one interview. I felt I aced it, but nothing came of it. Granted, I didn't apply every day for the last year as I was busy trying to find  a day job to pay the bills, but still just one company reached out to me. The reason, I feel, is that I am just not that impressive on paper and have been trying to tackle projects that would set me a part from other entry level applicants. Essentially I want to get practical experience with Docker and AWS.\n\nMy current plan is to get AWS DVA-C02 certification and hopefully come up with some decent projects that I can deploy on AWS that somehow utilize Docker without putting me into too much debt. I purchased the Tutorials Dojo DVA-C02 class, though it is pretty dry. I was hoping there would be a lot more practical hands on tutorials similar to Microsoft's Blazor tutorials. In addition to all that, I also filed for an LLC. It feels extreme, but someone recommended I do that and just \"put out shitty apps,\" for experience.\n\nSo, I suppose my questions are thus:  \nDo you recommend a new grad getting the DVA-C02 certification? Most of what I see online are people with several years of experience under their belt getting AWS/Azure certs. Am I jumping the gun here? $150 isn't nothing in my current financial situation.\n\nIf the certification is a decent route to take, are there any tutorials or Youtubers you recommend that provide a more 'hands on' approach compared to Tutorials Dojo? I tried searching myself, but I feel this topic is oversaturated by the typical 'shovel sellers.'\n\nAs for Docker, I understand containerization conceptually, I just have a hard time understanding why/how I could utilize it in my projects. I am just a guy, and not a very smart one at that. Could you point me to some valuable resources? Possibly a tutorial that showcases the practical application of docker? I would like to do more than just make some containers for the sake of making containers. \n\nLastly, thank you for any opinions and recommendations. I have been very frustrated this past year as I feel I have been just learning tools rather than improving as a dev. It feels weird to get certified in a tool prior to getting any professional experience, but so many entry level job postings have AWS and similar tools as requirements along with docker. Neither of which have I touched in University.\n\n",
