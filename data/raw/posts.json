        "content": "*Disclaimer: this post is nothing but a rant.*\n\n---\n\nI've recently inherited a data project which is almost entirely based in Azure synapse.\n\nI can't even begin to describe the level of hatred and despair that this platform generates in me.\n\nLet's start with the biggest offender: that being Spark as the only available runtime. Because OF COURSE one MUST USE Spark to move 40 bits of data, god forbid someone thinks a firm has (*gasp!*) small data, even if the amount of companies that actually need a distributed system is less than the amount of fucks I have left to give about this industry as a whole.\n\nLuckily, I can soothe my rage by meditating during the downtimes, beacause testing code means that, if your cluster is cold, you have to wait between 2 and 5 business days to see results, meaning that each day one gets 5 meaningful commits in at most. Work-life balance, yay!\n\nSecond, the bane of any sensible software engineer and their sanity: Notebooks. I believe notebooks are an invention of Satan himself, because there is not a single chance that a benevolent individual made the choice of putting notebooks in production.\n\nI know that one day, after the 1000th notebook I'll have to fix, my sanity will eventually run out, and I will start a terrorist movement against notebook users. Either that or I will immolate myself alive to the altar of sound software engineering in the hope of restoring equilibrium.\n\nThird, we have the biggest lie of them all, the scam of the century, the slithery snake, the greatest pretender: \"yOu dOn't NEeD DaTA enGINEeers!!1\".\n\nBecause since engineers are expensive, these idiotic corps had to sell to other even more idiotic corps the lie that with these magical NO CODE tools, even Gina the intern from Marketing can do data pipelines!\n\nBut obviously, Gina the intern from Marketing has marketing stuff to do, leaving those pipelines uncovered. Who's gonna do them now? Why of course, the same exact data engineers one was trying to replace!\n\nExcept that instead of being provided with proper engineering toolbox, they now have to deal with an environment tailored for people whose shadow outshines their intellect, castrating the productivity many times over, because dragging arbitrary boxes to get a for loop done is clearly SO MUCH faster and productive than literally anything else.\n\nI understand now why our salaries are high: it's not because of the skill required to conduct our job. It's to pay the levels of insanity that we're forced to endure.\n\nBut don't worry, AI will fix it.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In this opinionated article I am going to explain why I believe we have reached peak Spark usage and why it is only downhill from here.\n\n# Before Spark\n\nSome will remember that 12 years ago [Pig](https://pig.apache.org), [Hive](https://hive.apache.org), [Sqoop](https://sqoop.apache.org), [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org) and MapReduce were all the rage. Many of us were under the spell of [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org) during those times.\n\n# Enter Spark\n\nThe brilliant [Matei Zaharia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateizaharia/) started working on Spark sometimes before 2010 already, but adoption really only began after 2013.  \nThe lazy evaluation and memory leveraging as well as other [innovative features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0Tisli7zn4&t=97s) were a huge leap forward and I was dying to try this new promising technology.  \nMy then CTO was visionary enough to understand the potential and for years since, I, along with many others, ripped the benefits of an only improving Spark.\n\n# The Losers\n\nHow many of you recall companies like [Hortonworks](https://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Webinar.HDP2_.20131112.pdf) and [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/about.html)? Hortonworks and Cloudera merged after both becoming public, only to be taken private a few years later. Cloudera still exists, but not much more than that.\n\nThose companies were yesterday’s [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com) and they bet big on the Hadoop ecosystem and not so much on Spark.\n\n# Hunting decisions\n\nIn creating Spark, Matei did what any pragmatist would have done, he piggybacked on the existing Hadoop ecosystem. This allowed Spark not to be built from scratch in isolation, but integrate nicely in the Hadoop ecosystem and supporting tools.\n\nThere is just one problem with the Hadoop ecosystem…it’s exclusively **JVM based**. This decision has fed and made rich thousands of consultants and engineers that have fought with the [GC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) and inconsistent memory issues for years…and still does. The JVM is a solid choice, safe choice, but despite more than 10 years passing and Databricks having the plethora of resources it has, some of Spark's core issues with managing memory and performance just can't be fixed.\n\n# The writing is on the wall\n\nChange is coming, and few are noticing it ([some do](https://nolanlawson.com/2024/10/20/why-im-skeptical-of-rewriting-javascript-tools-in-faster-languages/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). This change is happening in all sorts of supporting tools and frameworks.\n\nWhat do [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), [Deno](https://deno.com), [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) and the Linux kernel all have in common that no one cares about...for now? They all have a Rust backend or have an increasingly large Rust footprint. These handful of examples are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nRust is the most prominent example and the forerunner of a set of languages that offer performance, a completely different memory model and some form of usability that is hard to find in market leaders such as C and C++. There is also Zig which similar to Rust, and a bunch of other languages that can be found in TIOBE's top 100.\n\nThe examples I gave above are all of tools for which the primary target are not Rust engineers but Python or JavaScipt. Rust and other languages that allow easy interoperability are increasingly being used as an efficient reliable backend for frameworks targeted at completely different audiences.\n\nThere's going to be less of \"by Python developers for Python developers\" looking forward.\n\n# Nothing is forever\n\nSpark is here to stay for many years still, hey, Hive is still being used and maintained, but I believe that peak adoption has been reached, there's nowhere to go from here than downhill. Users don't have much to expect in terms of performance and usability looking forward.\n\nOn the other hand, frameworks like [Daft](https://www.getdaft.io) offer a completely different experience working with data, no strange JVM error messages, no waiting for things to boot, just bliss. Maybe it's not Daft that is going to be the next best thing, but it's inevitable that Spark will be overthroned.\n\n# Adapt\n\nDatabricks better be ahead of the curve on this one.  \nInstead of using scaremongering marketing gimmicks like labelling the use of engines other than Spark as *Allow External Data Access*, it better ride with the wave.",

        "content": "I’ve benchmarked it. For use cases in my specific industry it’s something like x5, x7 more efficient in computation. It looks like it’s pretty revolutionary in terms of cost savings. It’s faster and cheaper.\n\nThe problem is PySpark is like using a missile to kill a worm. In what I’ve seen, it’s totally overpowered for what’s actually needed. It starts spinning up clusters and workers and all the tasks. \n\nI’m not saying it’s not useful. It’s needed and crucial for huge workloads but most of the time huge workloads are not actually what’s needed.\n\nSpark is perfect with big datasets and when huge data lake where complex computation is needed. It’s a marvel and will never fully disappear for that.\n\nAlso Polars syntax and API is very nice to use. It’s written to use only one node. \n\nBy comparison Pandas syntax is not as nice (my opinion). \n\nAnd it’s computation is objectively less efficient.  It’s simply worse than Polars in nearly every metric in efficiency terms.\n\nI cant publish the stats because it’s in my company enterprise solution but search on open Github other people are catching on and publishing metrics.\n\nPolars uses Lazy execution, a Rust based computation (Polars is a Dataframe library for Rust). Plus Apache Arrow data format.\n\nIt’s pretty clear it occupies that middle ground where Spark is still needed for 10GB/ terabyte / 10-15 million row+ datasets. \n\nPandas is useful for small scripts (Excel, Csv) or hobby projects but Polars can do everything Pandas can do and faster and more efficiently.\n\nSpake is always there for the those use cases where you need high performance but don’t need to call in artillery. \n\nIts syntax means if you know Spark is pretty seamless to learn.\n\nI predict as well there’s going to be massive porting to Polars for ancestor input datasets.\n\nYou can use Polars for the smaller inputs that get used further on and keep Spark for the heavy workloads. The problem is converting to different data frames object types and data formats is tricky. Polars is very new.\n\nMany legacy stuff in Pandas over 500k rows where costs is an increasing factor or cloud expensive stuff is also going to see it being used.\n\n",

        "content": "Hey All,\n\nI've had an incredible year and I feel extremely lucky to be in the position I'm in. I'm a relatively new DE, but I've covered so much ground even in one year.\n\nI'm not perfect, but I can feel my growth. Every day I am learning something new and I'm having such joy improving on my craft, my passion, and just loving my experience each day building pipelines, debugging errors, and improving upon existing infrastructure.\n\nAs I look back I wanted to share some gems or bits of valuable knowledge I've picked up along the way:\n\n* Showing up in person to the office matters. Your communication, attitude, humbleness, kindness, and selflessness goes a long way and gets noticed. Your relationship with your client matters a lot and being able to be in person means you are the go-to engineer when people need help, education, and fixing things when they break. Working from home is great, but there are more opportunities when you show up for your client in person.\n* pre-commit hooks are valuable in creating quality commits. Automatically check yourself even before creating a PR. Use hooks to format your code, scan for errors with linters, etc.\n* Build pipelines with failure in mind. Always factor in exception handling, error logging, and other tools to gracefully handle when things go wrong.\n* DRY - such as a basic principle but easy to forget. Any time you are repeating yourself or writing code that is duplicated, it's time to turn that into a function. And if you need to keep track of state, use OOP.\n* Learn as much as you can about CI/CD. The bugs/issues in CI/CD are a different beast, but peeling back the layers it's not so bad. Practice your understanding of how it all works, it's crucial in DE.\n* OOP is a valuable tool. But you need to know when to use it, it's not a hammer you use at every problem. I've seen examples of unnecessary OOP where a FP paradigm was better suited. Practice, practice, practice.\n* Build pipelines that heal themselves and parametrize them so users can easily re-run them for data recovery. Use watermarks to know when the last time a table was last updated in the data lake and create logic so that the pipeline will know to recover data from a certain point in time.\n* Be the documentation king/queen. Use docstrings, type hints, comments, markdown files, CHANGELOG files, README, etc. throughout your code, modules, packages, repo, etc. to make your work as clear, intentional, and easy to read as possible. Make it easy to spread this information using an appropriate knowledge management solution like Confluence.\n* Volunteer to make things better without being asked. Update legacy projects/repos with the latest code or package. Build and create the features you need to make DE work easier. For example, auto-tagging commits with the version number to easily go back to the snapshot of a repo with a long history.\n* Unit testing is important. Learn pytest framework, its tools, and practice making your code modular to make unit tests easier to create.\n* Create and use a DE repo template using cookiecutter to create consistency in repo structures in all DE projects and include common files (yaml, .gitignore, etc.).\n* Knowledge of fundamental SQL if valuable in understanding how to manipulate data. I found it made it easier understanding pandas and pyspark frameworks. ",

        "author": "bdadeveloper",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently completed a data engineering screening at a startup and now I’m wondering if my approach was right and how other engineers would approach or what more experienced devs  would look for. The screening was around 50 minutes, and they had me share my screen and use a blank Google Doc to jot down thoughts as needed — I assume to make sure I wasn’t using AI.\n\nThe Problem:\n\n\t“How would you design a system to ingest ~100TB of JSON data from multiple S3 buckets”\n\nMy Approach (thinking out loud, real-time mind you):\n\t•\tI proposed chunking the ingestion (~1TB at a time) to avoid memory overload and increase fault tolerance.\n\t•\tStressed the need for a normalized target schema, since JSON structures can vary slightly between sources and timestamps may differ.\n\t•\tSuggested Dask for parallel processing and transformation, using Python (I’m more familiar with it than Spark).\n\t•\tFor ingestion, I’d use boto3 to list and pull files, tracking ingestion metadata like source_id, status, and timestamps in a simple metadata catalog (Postgres or lightweight NoSQL).\n\t•\tTalked about a medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold):\n\t•\tBronze: raw JSON copies\n\t•\tSilver: cleaned & normalized data\n\t•\tGold: enriched/aggregated data for BI consumption\n\nWhat clicked mid-discussion:\n\nAfter asking a bunch of follow-up questions, I realized the data seemed highly textual, likely news articles or similar.  I was asking so many questions lol.That led me to mention:\n\n\t•\tOnce the JSON is cleaned and structured (title, body, tags, timestamps), it makes sense to vectorize the content using embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, Sentence-BERT, etc.).\n\t•\tYou could then store this in a vector database (like Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate) to support semantic search.\n\t•\tTechniques like cosine similarity could allow you to cluster articles, find duplicates, or offer intelligent filtering in the downstream dashboard (e.g., “Show me articles similar to this” or group by theme).\n\nThey seemed interested in the retrieval angle and I tied this back to the frontend UX, because I deduced the target of the end data was a front end dashboard that would be in front of a client \n\nThe part that tripped me up:\n\nThey asked: “What would happen if the source data (e.g., from Amazon S3) went down?”\n\nMy answer was:\n\n\t“As soon as I ingest a file, I’d immediately store a copy in our own controlled storage layer — ideally following a medallion model — to ensure we can always roll back or reprocess without relying on upstream availability.”\n\nLooking back, I feel like that was a decent answer, but I wasn’t 100% sure if I framed it well. I could’ve gone deeper into S3 resiliency, versioning, or retry logic.\n\nWhat I didn’t do:\n\t•\tI didn’t write much in the Google Doc — most of my answers were verbal.\n\t•\tI didn’t live code — I just focused on system design and real-world workflows.\n\t•\tI sat back in my chair a bit (was calm), maintained decent eye contact, and ended by asking them real questions (tools they use, scraping frameworks, and why they liked the company, etc.).\n\nOf course nobody here knows what they wanted, but now I’m wondering if my solution made sense (I’m new to data engineering honestly):\n\t•\tShould I have written more in the doc to “prove” I wasn’t cheating or to better structure my thoughts?\n\t•\tWas the vectorization + embedding approach appropriate, or overkill?\n\t•\tDid my fallback answer about S3 downtime make sense ?\n",

I’ve completed several online courses and done some hands-on practice, but when it comes to actual job interviews (especially those first calls with hiring managers), I’m not making it through.\n\nThis has really shaken my confidence. I’m beginning to worry: did I wait too long to make the shift? Is my career in data engineering over?\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation or has advice on how to bridge this gap, especially when transitioning from legacy tech to modern stacks, I’d really appreciate your thoughts.\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

But out of all the options, Data Engineering is the one I’ve liked the most. With the help of ChatGPT, some networking on LinkedIn, and of course Reddit, I now have a clearer idea of which courses to take.

        "content": "Hey all! \n\nOver the years, I’ve worked at companies as small as a team of 10 and at organizations with thousands of data engineers, and I’ve seen wildly different philosophies around analytical data.\n\nSome organizations go with the \"build it and they will come\" data lake approach, broadly ingesting data without initial structure, quality checks, or governance, and later deriving value via a medallion architecture.\n\nOthers embed governed analytical data directly into their user-facing or internal operations apps. These companies tend to treat their data like core backend services managed with a focus on getting schemas, data quality rules, and governance right from the start. Similar to how transactional data is managed in a classic web app.\n\nI’ve found that most data engineering frameworks today are designed for the former state, Airflow, Spark, and DBT really shine when there’s a lack of clarity around how you plan on leveraging your data. \n\nI’ve spent the past year building an open-source framework around a data stack that's built for the latter case (clickhouse, redpanda, duckdb, etc)—when companies/teams know what they want to do with their data and need to build analytical backends that power user-facing or operational analytics quickly.\n\nThe framework has the following core principles behind it:\n\n1. Derive as much of the infrastructure as possible from the business logic to minimize the amount of boilerplate\n2. Enable a local developer experience so that I could build my analytical backends right alongside my Frontend (in my office, in the desert, or on plane)\n3. Leverage data validation standards— like types and validation libraries such as pydantic or typia—to enforce data quality controls and make testing easy\n4. Build in support for the best possible analytical infra while keeping things extensible to incrementally support legacy and emerging analytical stacks\n5. Support the same languages we use to build transactional apps. I started with Python and TypeScript but I plan to expand to others\n\nThe framework is still in beta and it’s now used by teams at big and small companies to build analytical backends. I’d love some feedback from this community\n\nYou can take it for a spin by starting from a boilerplate starter project:[ https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart)\n\nOr you can start from a pre-built project template for a more realistic example:[ https://docs.fiveonefour.com/templates](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/templates)",

        "author": "wearz_pantz",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I have this idea for a data lake/data warehouse architecture for my startup that I've come to based on a few problems I've experienced, I'd like to hear this subreddits' thoughts.\n\nThe start up I work for has been dancing around product-market fit for several years, but hasn't quite nailed it. We though we had it in 2020 but then zero-interest rate ended, then AI, and now we're back to the drawing board. The mandate from leadership has been to re-imagine what our product can be. This means lots of change and we need to be highly nimble.\n\nToday, I follow an ELT approach. I use a combination of 3rd party ingestion tools+custom jobs to load data, then dbt to build assets (tables/views) in BigQuery that I make available to various stakeholders. My transformation pipeline looks like the following:\n\n1. staging - light transformations and 1:1 with raw source tables\n2. intermediate - source data integrated/conformed/cleansed\n3. presentation - final clean pre-joined,pre-aggregated data loosely resembling a Kimball-style star schema\n\nStaging and intermediate layers are part of a transformation step and often change, are deleted, or otherwise break as I refactor to support the presentation layer.\n\n[Current architecture which provides either 1 type of guarantee or no guarantee](https://preview.redd.it/lw8za6s3ggye1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=e36ac4259058bcce5ae72fbdef1e8bb7ec2e2eb5)\n\nThis approach has worked to a degree. I serve a large variety of use cases and have limited data quality issues, enough that my org has started to form a team around me. But, it has created several problems that have been exacerbated by this new agility mandate from leadership:\n\n1. As a team of one and growing, it takes me too long to integrate new data into the presentation layer. This results in an inability for me to make data available fast enough to everyone who needs it, which leads to shadow and/or manual data efforts by my stakeholders\n2. To avoid the above I often resort to granting access to staging and intermediate layer data so that teams are unblocked. However, I often need to refactor staging/intermediate layers to appropriately support changes to the presentation layer. These refactors introduce breaking changes which creates issues/bugs in dependent workflows/dashboards. I've been disciplined about communicating to stakeholders about the risks involved, but it happens often.\n3. Lots of teams want a dev version of data so they can create proof-of-concepts, and develop on my data. However many of our source systems have dev/prod environments that don't integrate in the same way. ex. join keys between 2 systems' data that work in prod are not available in dev, so the highly integrated nature of the presentation layer makes it impossible to produce exact replicas of dev and prod.\n\nTo solve these problems I've been considering am architectural solution that I think makes sense for a fast-moving startup... I'm proposing we break the data assets into 2 categories of data contract...\n\n1. **source-dependent**. These assets would be fast to create and make available. They are merely a replica of the data in the source system with a thin layer of abstraction (likely a single dbt model) with guarantees against changes by me/my team, but would not provide guarantees against irreconcilable changes in the source system (ie. if the source system is removed). These would also have basic documentation and metadata for discoverability. They would be similar to the staging layer in my old architecture, but rather than being an unstable step in a transformation pipeline, where refactors introduce breaking, they are standalone assets. These would also provide the ability to create dev and prod version since they are not deeply integrated with other sources. ex. \\`salesforce\\_\\_opportunities\\` all opportunities from salesforce. As long as the opportunity object in Salesforce exists, and we continue to use Salesforce as our CRM, the model will be stable/dependable.\n2. **source-agnostic**. The assets would be the same as the presentation layer I have today. They would be a more complex abstraction of multiple source systems, and provide guarantees against underlying changes to source systems. We would be judicious about where and when we create these. ex. \\`opportunities\\`. As long as our business cares about opportunities/deals etc. no matter if we change CRM's or the same CRM changes their contract, this will be stable/dependable\n\n[Proposed architecture which breaks assets into 2 types with different guarantees](https://preview.redd.it/mqt2ojo7ggye1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=070c5524998a56569b96fda3201a4567489cd89d)\n\nThe hope is that source-dependent assets can be used to unblock new data use cases quickly with a reasonable level of stability, and source-agnostic assets can be used to support critical/frequented data use-cases with a high level of stability.\n\nSpecifically I'm curious about:\n\n1. General thoughts on this approach. Risks/warnings/vibe-check.\n2. Other ways to do this I should consider. It's hard to find good resources on how to deliver stable data assets/products at a fast-moving startup with limited data resourcing. Most of the literature seems focused on data for large enterprises",

Also since the Data size is very small, any suggestions on how to create a porject with larger datasets.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated and would help me immensely. \n",

I work mainly with streaming data / events data and none of the existing frameworks were really designed for generating real world steaming data.\n\nWhat I needed was a flexible data generation that can create data with a dynamic schema and has the ability to send that data to a destination (csv, kafka).We all have used Faker and its a great library but in itself doesn't finish the job. All my*scriptsl* were using Faker but always extended with some additional usecase. This is how I ended up writing [glassgen](https://pypi.org/project/glassgen/). It generates synthetic data, sends it to a sink and is simply configured by a json config. It can also generate duplicates in the data (if you want) and can send at a defined rps (best effort). \n\nHappy to hear your feedback and hope you find the library useful. Thanks",

I'm only really familiar with a handful of these platforms but even just selecting a column I normally have to go and dig up it's data type from some other interface, let alone getting any of the engineers' documentation on it.\n\nSnowflake for instance allows us to create `comments` pinned to tables, views, schemas , columns. The lot basically. Why are these comments so hidden to our users whilst they're actually writing the queries that make use of these tables, columns, etc?\n\nOur team goes to a decent amount of effort to build useful and readable documentation around each table but is it any use if the end users have to pull up the docs in a separate tab before they understand that they're using the wrong column for their joins?\n\nThis feels like something that's not too hard to implement, I know having objects tagged with a comment or description is already a nice to have in the data world but surely we can do better? Please tell me that I've just been unlucky and most solutions do this cleanly out of the box. Is there a platform or at least some DBM software out there that's doing this that I'm just unaware of?",

        "author": "YerayR14",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently based in Spain, so while the job market isn’t great, it’s not as tough as in the US. A few months ago, during my final year of Computer Engineering, I realized I’m genuinely passionate about the data field, especially Data Engineering and Analytics. Since then, I’ve been self-studying with the goal of starting as a Data Analyst and eventually becoming a Data Engineer.\n\nSince January, I’ve been doing an internship at a large consulting firm (180K+ employees worldwide). Initially, they didn’t give much detail about the technologies I’d be working with, but I had no other offers, so I accepted. It turned out to involve Adelia Studio, CGS, AS400, and some COBOL, technologies unrelated to my long-term goals.\n\nThese teams usually train interns in legacy systems, hoping some will stay even if it’s not what they want. But I’ve been clear about my direction and decided to take the risk. I spoke with my manager about possibly switching to a more aligned project. Some might have accepted the initial path and tried to pivot later, but I didn’t want to begin my career in a role I have zero interest in.\n\nLuckily, he understood my situation and said he’d look into possible alternatives. One of the main reasons they’re open to the change is because of my attitude and soft skills. They see genuine interest and initiative in me. That said, the feedback I’ve received on my technical performance has also been very positive. As he told me: *“We can teach someone any tech stack in the long term, but if they can’t communicate properly, they’ll be difficult to work with.”* Just a reminder that soft skills are as important as hard skills. It doesn’t matter how technically good you are if you can’t collaborate or communicate effectively with your team and clients.\n\nThankfully, I’ve been given the chance to switch to a new project working with Murex, a widely used platform in the banking sector for trading, risk, and financial reporting. I’ll be working with technologies like Python, PL/SQL (Oracle), Shell scripting, Jira... while gaining exposure to automated testing, data pipelines, and financial data processing.\n\nHowever, while this project does involve some database work and scripting, it will largely revolve around working directly with the Murex platform, which isn’t strongly aligned with my long-term goal of becoming a Data Engineer. That’s why I still have some doubts. I know that Murex itself has very little correlation with that career path, but some of the tasks I’ll be doing, such as data validation, automation, and working with databases, could still help me build relevant experience.\n\nSo overall, I see it as a better option than my previous assignment, since it brings me closer to the kind of work I want to do, even if it’s not with the most typical tools in the data ecosystem. I’d be really interested to hear what others think. Do you see value in gaining experience through a Murex-based project if your long-term goal is to become a Data Engineer? Any thoughts or advice are more than welcome.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that I was told there may be opportunities to move to a more data-focused team in the future. Of course I would need to prove my skills whether through performance, projects, technical tests or completing a master’s program related to the field.\n\nThanks to anyone who took the time to read through this and offer any kind of feedback or advice. I genuinely appreciate it. Have a good day.",

When it’s time to build BI dashboards or forecasting models, they export **flat, denormalized CSV files** often multiple files filled with repeated data, inconsistent column names, and no clear keys.\n\nEven the core databases behind the scenes are sometimes just raw transaction or log tables with minimal structure. And when we try to request a cleaner version of the data, the response is often something like:\n\n>“We can’t share it, it contains personal information.”\n\nSo we end up spending days writing custom scripts, drawing ER diagrams, and trying to reverse-engineer schemas and still end up with brittle pipelines. The root issues never really go away, and that slows down everything: dashboards, models, insights.\n\nAfter running into this over and over, I built a small tool for myself called **LayerNEXUS** to help bridge the gap:\n\n* Upload one or many CSVs (even messy, denormalized ones)\n* Automatically detect relationships across files and suggest a clean, normalized (3NF) schema\n* Export ready-to-run SQL (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite)\n* Preview a visual ERD\n* Optional AI step for smarter key/type detection\n\nIt’s free to try no login required for basic schema generation, and GitHub users get a few AI credits for the AI features.  \n🔗 [https://layernexus.com](https://layernexus.com) *(I’m the creator just sharing for feedback, not pushing anything)*\n\nIf you’re dealing with raw log-style tables and trying to turn them into an efficient, well-structured database, this tool might help your team design something more scalable and maintainable from the ground up.\n\nWould love your thoughts:\n\n* Do you face similar issues?\n* What would actually make this kind of tool useful in your workflow?\n\n**Thanks in advance!**  \nMax",

        "content": "Hello folks, I recently joined a research center with a mission to manage data generated from our many labs. This is my first time building data infrastructure, I'm eager to learn from you in the industry.\n\nWe deal with a variety of data. Time-series from sensor data log, graph data from knowledge graph, and vector data from literature embedding. We also have relational data coming from characterization. Right now, each lab manages their own data, they are all saved as Excel for csv files in disperse places.\n\nFrom initial discussion, we think that we should do the following:\n\nA. Find databases to house the lab operational data.\n\nB. Implement a data lake to centralize all the data from different labs\n\nC. Turn all relational data to documents (JSON), as schema might evolve and we don't really do heave analytics or reporting, AI/ML modelling is more of the focus.\n\nIf you have any comments on the above points, they will be much appreciated.\n\nI also have a question in mind:\n\n1. For databases, is it better to find specific database for each type of data (neo4j for graph, Chroma for vector...etc), or we would be better of with a general purpose database (e.g. Cassandra) that houses all types of data to simplify managing processes but to lose specific computing capacity for each data type(for example, Cassandra can't do graph traversal)?\n2. Cloud infrastructure seems to be the trend, but we have our own data center so we need to leverage it. Is it possible to use the managed solution from Cloud provides (Azure, AWS, we don't have a preference yet) and still work with our own storage and compute on-prem?\n\nThank you for reading, would love to hear from you.",

        "content": "Hello dear people! Been dealing with this very interesting problem that I'm not 100% sure how to tackle. A local forum went down some time ago and they lost a few hours worth of data since backups aren't hourly. Quite a few topics were lost, as well as some of them apparently became corrupted and also got lost. One of them included a very nice discussion about local mountaineering and beautiful locations which a lot of people are saddened to lost since we discussed many trails. Somehow, people managed to collect data from various cached sources, computers, some screenshots, but mostly old google, bing caches while they worked and webarchive. \n\nNow it's all properly ordered in pdf document but the thing is the layouts often change and so does resolution but the general idea of how data is represented is the same. There's also some artifacts in data from webarchive for example - they have an element hovering over text and you can't see it, but if you ctrl-f to search for it it's there somehow, hidden under the image haha. No javascript in PDF, something else, probably  colored, no idea.\n\nThe ideas I had were (btw PDF is OCR'd already):\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- PDF to text and try to regex + LLM process it all somehow?\n\n- Somehow \"train\" (if train is a proper word here?) machine vision / machine learning for each separate layout so that it knows how to extract data\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut I also face issue that some posts are for example screenshoted in \"half\", e.g. page 360 has the text cut out and continue on page 361 with random stuff on top from the archival's page (e.g. webarchive or bing cache info). I would need to also truncate this, but that should be easy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Or option 3 with those new LLMs that can somehow recognize images or work with PDF (idk how they do it) I could maybe have the LLM do the whole heavy load of processing? I could pick up one of better new models with big context length and remembrance, I just checked total character count, it's 8.588.362 characters or 2.147.090 tokens approximately, but I believe the data could be split and later manually combined or something? I'm not sure I'm really new to this. The main goal is to have a nice json output with all data properly curated.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMany thanks! Much appreciated.",

        "content": "Hi y’all. A little background on my situation: I graduated with a BA last year and am planning on attending law school for my JD here in Canada in fall 2026. Getting into law school in Canada is really competitive, so as a backup plan, I’m considering starting an additional degree in data science in case law school doesn’t work out. My previous degree was almost completely free due to scholarships, and since I’m in the process of joining the military I can get a second degree subsidized.   \n\nI already have a BA, so I would like to use elective credits from my previous degree toward a BSc if that’s the route I take. The only issue is that a lot of Canadian universities don’t allow you to transfer credits from previously earned degrees. Because of this, I’ve been looking into less prestigious but equally accredited school options. \n\nMy concerns are mostly about co-op opportunities, networking, and how much school reputation influences your earning potential and career growth in this field. I know that law is pretty much a meritocracy in Canada, but the alumni connections made through your university can mean the difference between tens of thousands of dollars per year. \n\nIdeally, I want to go to a school that has strong co-op programs to gain experience, and would potentially want to do an honours thesis or project. I’ve spoken to some people in CS and they’ve recommended I just do a CE boot camp, or take a few coding classes at a community college and then pursue a MS in data science. I don’t like either of these suggestions because I feel that I wouldn’t have as strong a theoretical background as someone who completed a 4 year undergrad degree. \n\nAny insight would be really helpful!

        "content": "I've been messing around with CKAN and the whole Data Package spec lately, and honestly, I'm kind of surprised they barely get mentioned on this sub.\n\nFor those who haven't come across them:\n\nCKAN is this open-source platform for publishing and managing datasets—used a lot in gov/open data circles.\n\nData Packages are basically a way to bundle your data (like CSVs) with a datapackage.json file that describes the schema, metadata, etc.\n\nThey're not flashy, no Spark, no dbt, no “AI-ready” marketing buzz - but they're super practical for sharing structured data and automating ingestion. Especially if you're dealing with datasets or anything that needs to be portable and well-documented.\n\nSo my question is: why don't we talk about them more here? Is it just too \"dataset\" focused? Too old-school? Or am I missing something about why they aren't more widely used in modern data workflows?\n\nCurious if anyone here has actually used them in production or has thoughts on where they do/don't fit in today's stack.",

Is it so basic it's not advertised and I missed it somehow, or is this not a typical use-case for other projects?

        "content": "Hi.\n\n  \nBackground: We want to deploy a new clickhouse cluster, and retire our old one. The problem we have rn is that our older cluster version is very old (19.x.x), and our team could not update it for the past few years. After trying to upgrade the cluster gracefully, we have decided to go against it, and deploy a new cluster, sync the data between these two and then retire the old one. Both clusters are only getting inserts by a set of similar kafka engine tables that are inserting new data into materialized views that populate the inner tables. But the inner table schemas have changed a bit.\n\n  \nI tried clickhouse-backup, but the issue is that the database/metadata have changed, the definition of our tables, zookeeper paths and etc (our previous config had faults). For this issue, we could not also use clickhouse-copier.\n\n  \nI'm currently thinking of writing an ELT pipeline, that reads that from our source clickhouse and writes it to our destination one with some changes. I tried looking up AirByte and DLT, but the guides are mostly about using clickhouse as a sink, not a source.  \n  \nThere is also the option of writing the data to kafka, and consume it on the target cluster from kafka, but I could not find a way to do a full kafka dump using clickhouse. The problem of clickhouse being the sink in most tools/guides is also apparent here\n\nCan anybody help me out? It's been pretty cumbersome as of now.",

I’ve read it involves creating a new file with the terminal (which I’m not particularly comfortable using). Is there any other way of doing it? Also, what would the consequences of not hiding API keys be and will the rest of the code still be visible to people I share it with?\n\nEdit: thank you for all the comments everyone—they’ve been very helpful and eye opening. As an addendum, here’s my plan to address all the security concerns that have been brought up:\n\n(First, though, I’ve already revoked/made new API keys and haven’t committed them to GitHub, so please don’t worry about that anymore.)\n\n1. I think I’m going to go with GitHub secrets as the most simple way to still have the page functional and secure on pages to share with potential co-ops. Alternatively, I’m going to look into Netlify, which a lot of people have recommended as a simple solution. \n\n2. After that’s done, I’m going to create an alternate version where I use PHPmyAdmin to store the keys and then retrieve them with PHP to showcase doing both (that’s the plan anyways). I’ve avoided PHP since I don’t really understand servers and hosting (haven’t had a class on that yet). Like I don’t know how to make PHP work outside my XAMPP htdocs folder, and it won’t be functional for people I share with (to my knowledge).\n\nAs always, any additional advice would be appreciated, especially if there’s anything wrong with my intended approaches",

I was super excited to transfer just one hour away because the program has project-based classes, and that was exactly what I was looking for. After a tough and competitive admission process, I was finally able to get into the program. It felt like a huge achievement, especially given how competitive it was.\n\nLast fall semester, I was given a project that was honestly much harder than anything I had worked on before. I started experiencing a lot of imposter syndrome, and to make things worse, I realized I really struggle with public speaking—something that became a big challenge during group presentations. Even though it was tough, I stuck with it as much as I could until the final weeks of the semester. But then, I completely panicked and ended up skipping the final presentation, ignoring both my teammates and professors.\n\nAs a result, I ended up failing the course and got kicked out of the CS program. Now, I’m back at home, feeling completely stuck and unsure what to do next. I can’t help but regret the way I handled everything, especially the missed opportunity. I know I let my fear and lack of confidence get the best of me, but I don’t know how to move forward.\n\nI guess I’m asking for advice from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or just has some perspective on what my next steps should be.

(Most devs know very little about IT infrastructure, so my cross-functional knowledge was know enough of both worlds to be able to make something sensible.)\n\nIt's such a small thing, but she assigned a task in their dev tracker and I did a PR into a live software project for a company that I work for the first time in my life and even though I'm not a dev (yet!) it's still made me feel like in a small part I'm almost reached that thing that I've literally dreamed of doing for 35 years.\n\nI didn't have anyone else to share this with, so I hope you don't mind me sharing the story here.",

I have been programming for about 6 months now. In the beginning i had a lot of time so Ive spent well over 1k hours on it. I have made my own http server, back end web app type stuff, simple CLI stuff etc. I worked with python briefly and now really only use golang. \n\nI suppose the next step would be learn some front end and start making fully fledged applications/web apps. But it sounds uninteresting to me. I think I am interested in lower level stuff. I started reading \"Modern C\" just for 20-30 mins a day. But I don't want to be that guy thats mediocre at many languages. So I still want to use Go.\n\nI am so lost though, what path do i take if making web apps is uninteresting? I am currently enrolled in math classes, but I need more time (another 6 months) to genuinely use calculus or other more complex math in my programs. E.G. graphics ,rendering, things like that. \n\nPls help , Im feeling lost, but I still like programming. I need some sort of capstone project\n\n",

Sure its productive and a cool functionality. But... I just cant shake the feeling that it might not be good (esp as a beginner).

Later, I discovered Laravel, a PHP framework, and started working on backend development. Over time, I became skilled in Laravel and really enjoyed building applications.\n\nAs I grew, I realized that I needed a deeper understanding of PHP itself, so I took the time to learn PHP as well. I ended up creating the backend for many mobile applications and worked on complex projects. At that time, I was working at a service-based company, so I had to work on whatever came my way. That’s how I also ended up learning Node.js.\n\nYou could say I’m a backend developer who can work with a variety of frameworks like Laravel, Livewire, CakePHP, and Node.js.\n\nCurrently, I’m working at a fintech, product-based company. But here’s the funny part — even after four years of experience, I still feel like something is missing. I’m not sure what to learn next to truly grow. I've never done LeetCode problems, but I’m very good at solving real-world, complex problems that arise during application development.\n\nI also have a basic understanding of low-level languages like C++. But now I’m at a crossroads. Sometimes I feel like I should improve my JavaScript skills and learn React. Other times, I feel drawn toward AI and want to explore how to get better at that.\n\nThere’s a lot of confusion in my mind right now.\n\nI’m 22, and I still love learning and building new things. I genuinely enjoy creating. But I’m unsure what to learn next — something that will help me grow both financially and technically, and truly make me better.\n\nCan you guys please give me some good advice ?",

You have to keep asking the AI questions on how each line of that code works. He says that companies want you to get things done, they don't care how you did that. Hence all you need to know is how a code works and this method gets you ahead.\n\nHow would you do that?",

After doing some research, Django seemed like a solid option—it's Python-based, powerful, and in demand.\n\nI started a Django course and was making decent progress, but then my finals came up, and I had to put everything on hold. Now that my exams are over, I have around 15–20 free days before things pick up again, and I'm wondering—should I continue with Django and try to build something that could help me earn a little through freelancing (on platforms like Fiverr or LinkedIn)? Or is there something else that might get me to my goal faster?\n\nJust to clarify—I'm not chasing big money. Even a small side income would be helpful right now while I continue learning and growing. Long-term, my dream is to pursue a master's in Machine Learning and become an ML engineer. I have a huge passion for AI and ML, and I want to build a strong foundation while also being practical about my current needs as a student.\n\nI know this might sound like a confused student running after too many things at once, but I’d really appreciate any honest advice from those who’ve been through this path.

And am completing the Jose Padilla Python Zero to Hero Course on udemy, I plan on then learning about Data Structures and Algorithms, I have some resources I can tackle it with. Including Abdul Bari on youtube the whole playlist. This course on youtube by freecodecamp that covers all of DSA on Python.   \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA&t=54s&ab\\_channel=freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA&t=54s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)  \nTheres also this one which is more general   \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0&ab\\_channel=freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)  \nand also a playlist on youtube by Greg Hogg on DSA. Also another resource on DSA was a course on udemy by Eishad Karimov. So. there are a lot of options on DSA, excited to learn all this.\n\nAfter that or while doing the DSA course I plan on completing, leetcode questions, this practice section on geeksforgeeks  \n [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions&itm\\_source=geeksforgeeks&itm\\_medium=main\\_header&itm\\_campaign=practice\\_header](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions&itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=main_header&itm_campaign=practice_header)  \nand this course by neetcode offering on freecodecamp which is the top 150 asked questions for interviewers?  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0u5nwSA0w0&ab\\_channel=freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0u5nwSA0w0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)\n\nThe problem that I am facing right now is that all this is for data science and ai I believe that Python is for, and I can use frameworks? I don't really understand it all very well. But my end goal is to create applications that can help give me streams of income. I understand what you will say that coding shouldn't be about the money, but I am genuinely interested in learning all the crevices of this large iceberg. I picked this route because it seemed to be a good starting point with a good roadmap. But as I started to go deeper there was just so much information that I really don't even know where to begin. Learned something about SQL, Flask, Tailwind CSS?   \n  \nThe source of inspiration for all this was this video by stoneycodes  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvO88XxNAzs&ab\\_channel=stoneycodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvO88XxNAzs&ab_channel=stoneycodes)  \nAnyway is this a good starting point? Like I said the end goal is to be able to create apps that I believe will make peoples lives easier. I've loving programming for a couple years now but a recent epiphany made me realize that if you want something you gotta go get it! Stop waiting for it. create your own luck if you want to say. Currently the python course by jose padilla, is frying my brain, the practice problems make my brain stop working. I don't know.. Some advice is appreciated it you're willing to share. Thank you have a blessed day! \n\n  \nP.S \n\nsorry for spelling errors :o",

So for a little bit of context: I am 23 years old and I lately found a passion for programming that I possibly never imagined to have, thanks to a small course I took in university. Keep in mind that my degree is nowhere near to CS or anything IT related.\n\nMeanwhile I can say I’m so happy to have found my passion for programming I want also to  pursue this path, no matter how hard it is. \nYes, the job market sucks. \nYes, I don’t have a degree. \nBUT, I really want to make it because I understood, after months of self sabotaging, that this is what I want from my life.\nAnd no, I’m not here for the money since I was already mentally prepared for economic uncertainties given my degree in linguistics.\n\nBut now I would like to ask you, what should I do? What’s the best option to break in the industry? These are my options:\n\n1.\t⁠⁠bootcamps: hella expensive, are they enough to provide credibility?\n2.\t⁠⁠going fully self taught: basically no credibility unless you’re born with the same IQ as Bill gates, and super hard.\n3.\t⁠⁠a coding academy: I found few coding academies in Europe that prepare you for 2-3 years and provide you some internships. They are partners of the global 42 network. Are they good? Apparently they’re very hard but I’m in for the ride\n4.\t⁠⁠online university: since I probably already trashed my parents’ money on a degree I would like this time to be responsible and pay for my own education and the only way I could do it is by getting a CS degree but online.\n\nGiven that I’d love to hear all your opinions, all these things which are already well known about the market being shit are not so relevant to me.

        "author": "Tough_Trust5713",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "The prior post about this provider of bootcamps has been archived by Reddit and doesn't allow to post comments, and the only allowed comment isn't genuine in my view:\n\n  \nI believe the DfE should initiate an investigation into the Software Development online bootcamp by this provider that they fully subsidise, to ensure accountability and protect future participants from what I deem unprofessional and childish behavior by its leads.\n\nBelow, I outline my key concerns:\n\n1) **Misleading duration.** The bootcamp was advertised on the Academy website as a 16-week training program to qualify participants as full-stack software developers, and when I enrolled I confirmed I agreed to 16 weeks. However, when I asked for proof of studies letter, the founder informed me via email that the duration was only 12 weeks, undermining the program’s promised scope and depth. I believe that shortening the DeF-agreed programme undermines the DfE’s expectation of transparency and value for money, and might reduce its effectiveness.\n\n2) **Misleading capacity.** The program was promoted as limited to 10 students, ensuring a 1:10 instructor-to-student ratio for personalized learning, including 1:1 office hours during lunch breaks, as described in the enrollment interview. Yet, an email from the administrator was sent to 24 students, significantly exceeding the advertised capacity and diluting the quality of instruction. This is concerning because Skills Bootcamps under the NSF must provide \"intensive, focused training to ensure participants gain employable skills\", and overcrowding can compromise this.\n\n3) **Breach of DPA.** The administrator failed to use Bcc in group emails, publicly disclosing the personal contact details of all participants without consent. This violates the data protection standards outlined by the DfE, which emphasize the need to protect personal data and respond effectively to breaches. Additionally, not offering an option to use an alternative email for Teams access further exacerbates the privacy breach, as it forces participants to expose private email addresses, violating GDPR’s requirement for informed consent, and the NSF expected compliance with DPA standards to ensure participant trust and safety.\n\n4) **Lack of planning and transparency**. Despite repeated requests, neither the founder nor the administrator provided a provisional timetable detailing the breakdown of hours for technical and soft skills training. Furthermore, the founder claimed daily sessions would start at 9:00 AM, but Teams instructions indicated 9:30 AM, with no clarity on end times or offline breaks, hindering effective preparation. This again infringes the DfE requirement for funded training to operate transparently, while poor planning could be seen as a failure to deliver the agreed provision effectively.\n\n5) **Unreasonable funder's behavior**. **One hour before the bootcamp’s start, I was removed from the program and blocked from accessing the academy’s Slack and Teams platforms. This decision was based on a trivial matter: the change of my 3mm Slack thumbnail picture the night before, which was deemed “unflattering” to the interviewer despite being a tiny, totally unrecognizable image.** This action demonstrates a lack of professionalism, fairness, and equitable access. Given that the DfE expects funded programs to ensure equitable access to education for eligible participants, the unreasonable removal could be seen as a failure to deliver the program.\n\n6) **Lack of empathy**. I explained to the founder and administrator that I had made significant financial and physical sacrifices to attend, including relocating to a new residence to ensure a suitable remote working environment. Despite these efforts, they refused to reinstate me, showing disregard for the challenges faced by participants, the public resources invested, and the support provided by others, such as my landlady, whose assistance was ultimately wasted. \n\n7) **Possible systematic waste of public funding received by the DfE.** Upon joining the academy’s Slack account, I noticed a “General” channel where instructors posted notes and recordings of the first lesson for the prior cohort, but engagement in that channel ended abruptly. This suggests the possibility of early termination of the bootcamp in the past. Additionally, the lack of transparency in participant identities on Slack, combined with the ease of removing participants, raises concerns: the program could misrepresent its impact by attributing employment outcomes to others who are not their students but find employment as developers.\n\n8) **Poor communication.** Essential details, such as session start times and access links, were buried in irrelevant information within login emails, raising questions about their fitness for role.\n\n9) **Gender Bias.** During the enrollment interview, I mentioned a podcast highlighting that women often end up in front-end development roles, which are less paid and more tedious than back-end roles dominated by men. The interviewer responded by stating that, in her view, this is because women are less capable in mathematics than men.  This bias contradicts the principles of equality and meritocracy in the tech industry and raises concerns about their inclusivity, especially given the DfE’s awareness of gender imbalances in Skills Bootcamps.\n\n",

Looking at job security, it seems that .NET is a pretty good gamble.\n\nSo for those of you working in the field:\n\n* What back-end tools, frameworks, or skills should I be learning alongside .NET to be job-ready? Things I've read about are Entity Framework Core, DTOs, Repository Pattern etc.\n* Are there databases, authentication tools, or cloud services that companies expect you to know?\n* Any tips for someone coming from the front-end world and transitioning to .NET?\n\nAppreciate any insight here - I'd love to hear what things I need to learn that'd make me most marketable.\n\nThanks!",

I am figuring out that a lot of what I do, can do and will do in this job/carreerpath will always be a supportive role.

What I do however struggle with enormously is figuring out what the base of coding is? \n\n  \nWhat is a terminal?   \nWhy do they do it in the environment they do it in?   \nWhat are all the buttons for in the visual studio code app?  \nHow do I know there is a library to be imported?  \nWhy would I test koop via LESP instead of running it?  \nI lack the true basic fundamentals. \n\nI would need a place to get me started in the basics of coding setup, like how to properly set up a database, how to initiate projects etc etc...\n\nCan anyone help me in the correct direction?  \nIf this is helpfull, I have experience in CAD, Vector mechanics, a lot of software programs that are graphic/visual based, have a lot of experience in parametric modelling, and up to first year uni understanding lineair algebra.

Moved to Switzerland and tripled my salary. A couple years later changed company and I’m almost at 160k fixed salary.\n\nAll that and… I’m not a super good developer. Honestly, compared to my peers I would say I’m slightly (very slightly) above average. I never did leetcode. I havent read a CS book in the last 10 years. I don’t keep up with new technologies (I’m a Java dev and I dont know what’s the latest version).\n\nBut hey, looking back on my career, I do think I have a few positive points that made me get here :\n\n- I have more social skills than 90% of my dev colleagues. Yes this in an stereotype. Some of the best developers I met are completely autistic. These guys can’t hold a normal conversation for 5 minutes. Let alone when there’s a woman in the conv\n\n- Learn languages. I’m one of the only ones on my team who can write in english correctly and speak without a heavy accent. I have been put in so many meetings just because I spoke english. Languages really open doors.\n\n- I never refused work. Whenever my boss asks me to do some menial, non-interesting, boring task… I just do it. When someone needs to do it, I volunteer for it. Really, it’s that simple, even if the task is dumb\n\n- When someone asks you do somethint, always ask for a ticket or an email. You’re not a decision taker, you’re a developer. This will get you out of trouble.\n\n- Be friends with people from other  : have a DBA friend, have a DevOps friend, have a Sec engineer friend. You’ll need them. \n\nThat’s it guys. It’s plain, simple and everyone can do it but most people won’t do it\n\n\n",

Thought I could find a home office gig, lock myself in my house, and never go outside to meet people. \n\nBut then this job market happened. I struggled so much with finding work that it actually made me rethink major life decisions. It pushed me to lose weight, dress nicely and go outside to network with people. During this journey, I have made good friends I frequently hangout with and it has given me so much social confidence that I am even able to cold approach people at events and make friends out of them. \n\nNow, have I found work despite all this? No. Not yet at least, but it has made me grow so much, and it has made me realize that this crappy job market was actually beneficial for me long term. \n\nGood luck to everyone who's out there struggling. I hope this journey can make you grow!",

I ask another contractor privately and they tell me it’s essentially mandatory if you don’t wanna get canned.  They don’t cover gas or parking or time so this is going to add 5 hours to my commute and cost me north of $350 a month in parking.  Do I have any power here to push back or am I screwed.  I feel totally cheated since recruiting firm in my offer letter has the job as remote.\n\nupdate:\nspoke to the staffing firm, the offer letter they sent over has the position marked as remote.  The team claims they messed up but that the docusign they sent over after had it marked as hybrid so I need to come into the office two days a week and that they don't have room in the profit model to afford to comp parking.

        "author": "megariffs",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "If you work at a company that uses old tech stacks and processes, try not to stay at that company for too long (unless they are transitioning to using a newer tech stack and processes) because when it's time to work at another company, your lack of experience in newer tech and processes may come back and bite you. They're good to gain professional experience but after a couple of years, you should try and find another job that's more in line with what industry is going towards\n\nWhen I graduated from college in 2016, my first job was a full-stack developer at a company I was working at while I was in college doing completely different work. I became their first in-house developer after I developed their Intranet site (as an internship project for my university) and redesigned their one of their customer referral forms. Their tech stack at the time was [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms for their customer portal and VB6 for the application that their employees used.\n\nAfter getting an opportunity to work at a startup that my former boss help start in 2022, I quit my then current job to work there. Less than a year later, I was let go due to \"inexperience\" even though I've done all my tasks on time, quickly learned React (the company initially was using [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms as a proof of concept before switching to React and [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core Web API), and I was receiving good reviews from my manager a month earlier. I believe I was scapegoated because the team itself was under performing, but I digress. With that being said, I learned quite a bit before I was let go. My first employer never used GitHub/Azure/etc, so I was unfamiliar with committing code, branch concepts, creating a PR, etc. I was also unfamiliar with newer [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) concepts like Dependency Injections, Program.cs, Middleware, etc that were in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core. Working at the startup exposed me to all of that.\n\nLuckily, I was able to find another job (which paid even more money) in less than 3 months. It was another company that used [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms for one of their applications and a mixture of [VB.NET/VB6](http://VB.NET/VB6) for another application. Fast forward to last month (April 3rd 2025), my position was eliminated. Therefore, I got laid off due to the company restructuring after having a bad financial outcome from the previous year. This time around, I wasn't let go due to performance. In fact, they emphatically praised me for being a great developer. My boss's boss emailed me afterwards to let me know that I can use him as a reference for another job and he'll reach out to contacts to see if anyone of them are looking for a developer to hire.\n\nWithin the last several weeks, I was able to get an interview at 3 companies (2 contract jobs and one  \ndirect to hire). This week, I made it to the second round of one company before they decided to go in another direction. They told my recruiter that my in-person interview was excellent but another candidate  they interviewed had more experience, so they decided to go with the other candidate. This time around,  \nthe companies I worked at previously never used automated testing, Microservices, CI/CD pipelines, service bus technology, etc. I felt like my lack of experience using those concepts came back and bit me.\n\nRegarding the two other companies, I did make it to the third round of the direct to hire job, but I'm  \nafraid that my lack of experience using .NET based service bus tech and potentially other tech may get in the way of me landing this job. I'm going to spending the entire week brushing up on those concepts before my final interview. I did get a job offer from the first company I interviewed at, but I'm hesitant to work there because it's only 3 month contract, it's a long commute to another state (40-45 min drive), and they want me to use React. I haven't used React in over a year.\n\nTLDR; Don't be like me and stick around at a company for too long that uses old tech stacks and processes or not spending enough time to learn newer tech. Granted, I tried to do that at times, but I have a newborn now. Also, my partner can be quite needy and wants to spend a lot of time with me. We've got into arguments in the past over me wanting to spend time after work to work on projects to develop new skills.\n\nEdit: Grammar\n\n \n\n ",

I graduated in the fall semester of 2014 and have been working as a developer for 7 and a manager for the last 4 years.\n\nRecently I began applying for jobs as an engineering manager. I have to say it’s been though in our side as well. While the amount of call backs I get is very high the amount of jobs for this level are also very low. \n\nI have applied to a mixture of companies from Fortune 50, to Fortune 500 in all sectors from Fintech to healthcare.\n\nI have had maybe 32 conversations with recruiters. I have a very specific requirement. I do not want to manage an overseas team especially if I have to go the office 5 days a week to do it.\n\nOut of those 32 conversations only one company Capital One had me managing developers in the USA. Every single other company was in India EVERY single other company. Sometimes I would get a mix where there would be 2-8 US devs just doing high level architecture design then handing the work over.\n\nI thought about the Capital One job and I reached out to a contact at there and he told me pretty much the whole team was basically here on H1B visas including the other engineering managers. I’ve been around long enough to know how bad monoculture work environments are especially with H1B’s AND stack ranking so I declined that job as well.\n\nI have to be honest with you guys. I am going to need a job soon. I have been trying my best not to contribute to this outsourcing mess especially when it’s denying opportunities to people like me who came from bad social economic backgrounds and a no name school and was blessed to get a junior role where I could grow.\n\nI been reaching out to my network and it’s the same everywhere. Whole teams are getting replaced. I have friends that used to work normal hours waking up in the middle of the night to jump into sprint planning meetings. I got people crying and hugging their employees as their entire in office team is laid off then they have to drive into the office everyday just to hop on zoom calls with people in Argentina.\n\nIf we don’t get some legislative solutions for this I think our sector is going to go the way of manufacturing. You are going to be telling your kids about how you used to work a tech job right out of college for a good wage.",

There’s a weird idea floating around that these senior developers and tech leads are born with some genetic advancement that makes their brains better at coding. I highly doubt that. I think they’ve just had years of experience. \n\nSoftware development is learned over time, it’s not something you’re just born good at. If this were basketball, ok this guys born with genetics that make him 7 feet tall. If this were football, ok this kid was born to be 260 pounds at 16 years old. But software development? That’s like… just being exposed too and practicing a tech stack repeatedly.\n\nIf your new grad is failing or not getting hired, let’s exclude new grads who genuinely just don’t want to be software developers or can’t work in an environment without freaking out and punching someone. They’re not who I’m talking about. \n\nSince the bare minimum requirement to even have a seed to grow into a good developer is the ability to break down complex problems, patience, persistence, and willingness to learn, I think the vast majority of people can grow into good developers. But people need structure, exposure, and practice with a consistent stack before you make judgement calls on their overall lifetime ability to excel in technology.\n\nBasically, I’m babbling, but new grads who want to be software developers being incompetent isn’t the problem here. I think it’s more likely just market demand, lack of onboarding structure and documentation, unreasonable expectations for a new graduate skill level.",

Dashboards, admin panels, internal tools, basic workflow platforms—99% of it is forms and tables over a database with some business logic sprinkled in.\n\nBut now we’ve got agents that can insert structured data directly from natural input (emails, PDFs, speech, whatever), and LLMs that can query and visualize that data however you want. Why bother building a UI at all? Why have a separate analytics dashboard if you can just ask for “revenue by cohort for Q2” and get a chart back?\n\nFeels like we’re heading toward a world where the core “app” isn’t a UI anymore—it’s just a schema + an agent + a model. And if that’s the future… does most CRUD work just evaporate?\n\nI know not everything can or should be replaced by this (think banking, social media etc), but I can’t shake the feeling that a lot of what we currently build is basically middleware between users and structured data—and LLMs are starting to eat that.\n\nAnyone else thinking about this?

We recently got a new developer on our team from a different team in the company, so he has little context/knowledge of our application or the data flow.\n\nHe was assigned a bug fix for a feature that I had implemented several months back so he's been coming to me for questions. The bug fix is a one line change. When he first picked up the ticket, he pinged me asking for some context/info. I provided him a detailed explanation of the flow and even pointed out how very similar bugs in the past have been fixed (the same solution as the one liner). I basically gave him everything he needed except for straight up telling him exactly what line to change. \n\nHe's been working on this ticket for 4 days now.\n\nAt what point do I step in and just tell him what to change? It feels like I would be kinda micromanaging him at that point but maybe I'm just looking at this wrong idk",

This friend always asked help from me in classes and somehow landed a way better internship than I did, even though I applied to over 400 last year and I’m not even international. Another one of my international friends landed Amazon swe. I can’t stop feeling like I am just not technically good enough, and I can’t stop wondering what is wrong with my application. I can’t help but to feel bitter when others land something better with way fewer applications. I have asked many people to look over my resume and they all say it’s good. People say it’s luck and a numbers game, but I have applied so much already and I can’t believe it’s only because im unlucky. I have had interviews from great companies, but I always somehow manage to screw it up and get rejected. I fully acknowledge the toxicity of my mindset and I would love to divert my energy to self improvement, but I have no idea how to stop feeling this way.

Then, they’ll list this as an internship on their see bee or LinkedIn page.\n\nInteresting, to be honest I interned at some large companies but basically did data entry and a very small amount of development work, but I of course listed it as “web developer intern using React” when React was maybe like 15% of the job, so I’m not hating on these guys. But my work was at “real” companies with thousands of employees so is actually verifiable, I’m curious as to if this strategy by students works.

I could also potentially find a solid remote role if we stayed.\n\nWe’re trying to balance the career benefits of joining FAANG on a team I would love against staying somewhere where we’re both really happy and have roots we’ve formed over the past three years.\n\nI could use some advice on:\n\n1. How much long-term value does a FAANG role really add to your resume and career growth? Is the FAANG name and learning actually that impactful on your career? (I think it is but could use perspectives)\n\n2. Do you think the payoff could be worth uprooting our lives on the East coast? \n\n3. How many years of experience at FAANG really makes a difference on your resume and your learning? It’s easier for us to consider moving for just a few years, and then coming back East. And hoping that the FAANG experience would open up a lot of opportunities and flexibility. \n\nThank you in advance!\n",

I knew all the theory but had nothing to show for it.\n\nThen one random weekend, I said screw it and built a tiny little site around something dumb I cared about. It didn’t follow the “perfect stack” or latest trends, but I actually finished it.

I have two potential explanations (pure speculation on my part)\n\n1. Maybe they don't want to deal with relocation. I can relocate myself but I'm not sure how to convey that without actually talking to someone.\n2. Maybe there is some kind of stigma / bad rep associated with Silly Valley and the people who work here. I can understand (I'm trying to GTFO after all) but I have no idea how I can get past that \n\n  \nIs any of this true ? Is there any other potential explanation ?

It was never a large team to begin with, 5 developers plus my manager, managing ecommerce platforms, data, internal business applications, b2b systems, AI services, etc.\n\nLast year we lost one developer who was frustrated by the direction we were going. Her position was never filled, instead they hired a developer from India in an adjacent team, to focus on software for the warehouse. Then one developer was moved to a specific niche dealing with our internal Microsoft integrations. Now finally, another developer is being removed from my team. They carried a lot of weight because they were one of those \"say yes to everything\" work 16-hour day folks. However, now they are being completely removed from our area of the company and reassigned. I'm left with 1 other developer and he is very junior.\n\nIn 1 year, I've gone from a 5 person team to a 2 person team, and yet no expectations have been adjusted. I am being told that I should take on all the responsibilities of the developer that's now being moved, while maintaining my current responsibilities, compensating for the 2 developers that left last year who were never filled, and on top of all that with the company breathing down my neck wanting to start no less than 5 new major projects.\n\nAnd my manager is acting like everything is completely normal and seems to have no concept that this is completely impractical. I have asked for more staff for a year but it's falling on deaf ears, even when projects that were supposed to take 4 months ended up taking us close to a year. At the very least I have been asking for the opportunity to pair-program and work with some of the more senior developers that have left or are being reassigned, and yet the company cannot make time for that. There's always an excuse, some other \"more pressing issue\" that I have to focus on before training can happen.\n\nI feel like I'm being set up to fail and I have no idea how to plan for this. I am obviously looking for other jobs, but this is the worst market in a long time. I have some financial cushion, but I don't want to quit because of how the Economy is looking. That said, if I don't quit it feels like I will really quickly be backed into a corner where I am being asked to work insane hours to address even a portion of the responsibilities that are being laid on me or have to be constantly explaining why things are delayed and all blame put on my shoulders.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "***Disclaimer: This post is not about me but a friend of mine. That nevertheless doesn't invalidate the seriousness of the situation. There’s a TL;DR at the end if you need it.***\n\n\nI've been working as a software engineer at my current company for about 2 years. From the very beginning, I disclosed that I have SLE lupus (an autoimmune condition), which means I’m constantly on anticoagulant medication. I also have a physical disability that makes daily commuting difficult.\n\n\nThankfully, things were manageable for a long time—my role allowed for hybrid work, with some days in-office and others WFH. That balance helped me stay productive and committed despite my health challenges.\n\n\nBut everything started shifting this year.\n\n\nThe company is preparing to go public and has been carrying out silent layoffs—mostly through performance improvement plans (PIPs). WFH flexibility has been dialed back, and there's increasing pressure to be in-office regularly. I complied with the new expectations despite the strain, kept putting in the hours, met all deadlines, and consistently received positive feedback.\n\nHowever, over the past couple of weeks, my health has taken a serious turn. I’ve developed gangrene in my left index finger—there’s a chance I could lose it, or even more fingers if it spreads. I was terrified to ask for leave, hoping things would heal. I kept working—coding one-handed with my right hand—just to avoid raising red flags.\n\n\nThen two days ago, I was blindsided.\n\n\nMy manager scheduled a recorded meeting and placed me on a PIP, claiming I had negative feedback from past team leads. This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager. After the meeting, my manager called me privately, off the record. He implied that he had no real control over the situation and gently suggested I start looking for a new role while going through the PIP.\n\n\nSo here I am—on a one-month PIP, with a two-month notice period after that if things don’t improve.\n\n\nAnd now my health is at a breaking point. I need time off, but I can’t afford to lose this job. My medical expenses are piling up fast. If I lose this income, I’ll probably have to leave my apartment and move back in with my parents, who are already under financial strain.\n\nI need advice. Please.\n* Should I try explaining the full extent of my condition to HR or management again and ask to pause the PIP or adjust expectations?\n* Should I ask for a quiet exit now with some kind of severance instead of going through a likely-failed PIP?\n* Has anyone faced something similar—being disabled and seriously ill while also under pressure to perform or leave?\n\nPlease don’t just say “prioritize your health and quit”—I wish I could, but I don’t have that privilege. I'm trying to survive, not just live. Any practical advice or shared experiences would really mean a lot right now.\n\n**TL;DR:**    \n**Software engineer with lupus + physical disability. Was managing well with hybrid work until company began silent layoffs via PIPs. Now being forced into WFO, health has worsened (developed gangrene in hand), but afraid to take leave. Just put on a PIP despite positive past feedback. Manager privately suggested I start job hunting. Can't afford to lose job due to high medical costs. Looking for advice on whether to fight the PIP, talk to HR, or ask for severance.**",

Initially came way via their summer analyst program and then returned as part of their Graduate Rotational Analyst program. \n\nIn my current role as a Systems Engineer I support trading infrastructure its kind of a mix of implementation, weekly meetings with vendors, benchmarking new and emerging technologies like processors and a lot of dealing with compliance issues because of the nature of being at a bank. Though I’m hitting my 5 year mark soon and I pretty stagnant where I’m at. On that note I did make it to few final rounds at a few Trading firms in Chicago but it was a typical case of me being too junior senior if that makes sense. \n\nThere are times when I learn a bit but a major of my time is chasing and mitigating risk and compliance stuff as new tech is introduced to the firm.\n\nIts more of an infrastructure role and not much of a dev/swe role though I done some automation with python. and on occassion do things in ansible, bash and so forth. \n\nHaven’t been promoted nor had a raise in the last 2 years or so. Although each time i was close my team was realigned or got a new manager about 2-3 times. \n\nHome is LA/Southern California and would like to stay on the west coast to be near family and my girlfriend so I’m looking at Seattle & The bay area. The tech market in LA seems weird to say the least. \n\nIs it really just a matter of grinding leetcode to land a new role? I feel ike 5-8 years ago that was the case but that might not seem to be it anymore? Though I could be wrong. \n\nI am looking at applying to an MS in Applied Math which my current firm would heavily subsidize and use that to pivot though unsure if that’d be the right move though it seems like the most like plausbile. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Kinda feel a little directonless at the momment. ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "For a long time, I’ve been obsessed with prestige and what people think of me. Only recently have I started to realize that this focus has been damaging.\n\nBack in college, I struggled to land strong internships. When people asked where I interned, I’d feel insecure.\n\nThis past new grad job hunt season was different. I did extremely well. But instead of simply feeling proud, I found myself bringing it up in almost every conversation — how many offers I got, how hard the decision was. My close friends pointed out that my conversations shifted away from hobbies and life to career decisions, leveling systems, and growth.\n\nWhen it came time to choose between job offers, I tried everything to make the “right” decision. I asked all my friends and family. I read every blog and polled every possible forum. I was obsessed with finding the most validated, socially acceptable path — the one society would approve of. Obviously it didn’t work. \n\nEventually, I had to ask myself: *Why do I feel the need to share my successes so often? Why is this decision so agonizing?* And I think the honest answer is that I care a lot about how others perceive me.\n\nBut digging deeper, that desire doesn’t feel purely ego-driven. In tech, **career advancement almost entirely depends on perception.** Recruiters scan for brand names. Managers reward visibility. Friends decide whether you’re worth a referral. Your market worth is defined by what others think, not by what you think you’re worth.\n\nThat’s why I find myself highlighting my accomplishments and leaning toward prestige. I want to be seen as someone worth helping, worth investing in. I want future recruiters to see my resume and not hesitate. But in the process, I’ve started to value prestige more than my own long-term goals and personal values.\n\nChoosing between offers this season was especially hard because they represented opposite sides of this internal conflict — one path aligned with prestige, the other with personal fit.\n\nConventional advice says to “stop caring what people think.” But is that even realistic when almost every system in tech (and the world in general) is based on what others think of you and how you're ranked?",

        "author": "jacquesroland",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I am a big proponent in that we should improve ourselves by relying on ourselves only, but after a decade of working in tech, and many more years being a student, I realize that unless you are extremely talented or lucky (or both), even just talking to a willing mentor can get you astronomically ahead in any endeavor, whether it be school or career. \n\nFor example I’ll talk about myself: I am first generation college grad in my family. My parents did not know anything about tech or software or even how you use a college degree to start a career. My pre-college education was also similarly ignorant of these things (I learned to programmed as sophomore in college!). In my Senior year in high school I took a university class and got the highest grade; it was surprisingly easy for me. Had my parents or teachers encouraged me much earlier I could have likely started college earlier even as a sophomore in high school or at least taken college classes alongside high school and gotten quite ahead when starting in university. \n\nA 2nd example, I majored in CS but nobody advised me on anything nor did I know what I had to do. I only majored in CS after a professor strongly advised me to. I had a single internship simply due to a connection with that same professor. But I didn’t know I should be studying LeetCode or applying at internships for big tech. I didn’t get my first real job until 1 year after I graduated.  So imagine if I never talked to that professor or took their advice !  One single person made an infinite positive difference in my life by just talking to them !\n\nOK, now let’s move to current day. I am mid career SWE, I write lots of code but also manage other SWEs. I want to keep advancing because I have strong options about how things should be done, and I see a lot of inefficiency in current engineering leadership. I guess you could call me Sauron if you know the analogy. I actually prefer being an IC but the amount of incompetence I observe at eng leadership drives me crazy and I feel it is my duty to course correct and help rather than just shrug my shoulders and keep my nose to the grinding wheel. \n\nFor those of you now late or end of career, what would you have advised your mid career self to be doing to get to where you are now sooner ?

        "content": "I've been at the same company for the last 4.25 years. The work has been very stable. Luckily it's not an industry that  gets affected much due to recent economic events. However with that said, we're only a startup and my salary is 96k CAD.\n\nIn terms of the position/job, I have literally zero complaints. I've never worried about my performance, the work itself is very chill, I get to work remote and I only do actual work for around 3-4hrs a day (usually less). The people are also incredibly nice and I truly believe I'll never meet a management team that's better than my current one. However, the pay is still pretty low, especially considering I now have over 4 years of experience. The only other con is that due to the work being so chill, I have recently felt like I've stopped learning new things. Every day it's the same CRUD operations in a different format so I feel like if I continue down this path I may end up with 6 YoE but not much talent to show for it. Don't get me wrong though, I've definitely learned a ton at my current company and how to build a system from end to end, but I don't think I can learn anymore as our use base is pretty small.\n\nSo, I've started to look around as to what's available. If I get a FAANG offer with 200k+ salary, I'd take it in a heartbeat but putting that to the side, I've slowly started getting responses from other startups and small companies with salaries ranging from 100k to 150k. This made me think, what is the minimum amount of money I'd need to leave my current situation? For example, my most recent first round interview with a company told me that they pay 120k but weirdly enough I almost felt like I'd rather stay at my 96k chill job than potentially change everything for just 24k.\n\nWhat do you guys think? If you were in my position making 96k but it's like a dream scenario in terms of WLB, bosses, etc, how much money would you need to be offered to quit? Also if it matters, I'm 28.",

And for the Final year, its a 6 month internship that start in January (half of the academic year is just the internship no classes), called PFE ( Projet Fin Etude), which translates to End of Education Project.\n\nYou supervisor has to give you like a grade on a form supplied by the school. At the start of the academic year. You have to present what you did at the internship in front of a panel of professors. And the the final one PFE internship project is a pretty big deal. You have to defend your work/project like a thesis in front of the panel. If you fuck up, you wont graduate.\n\nNow dont get me wrong our system is utter shit in many aspects. But at-least  you usually have a pretty solid CV showing real world experience.\n\nAnd I think this applies to all our schools not just Engineering.",

I got job with events and drones, Toured the country, did camera work semi professionally using other peoples equipment, went from NYC to LA and everywhere in-between while living in Pittsburgh.  (got to work for Disney, amazon-studios, NBA, multiple MLB teams)  \nTook some studio training got certified. and I made money doing it. The problem is, I started working at an amazon warehouse and I've gotten very \"lazy\"  \nat first it was just to pay bills, make ends meet, but then I got benefits, insurance ect, but you're a work horse, you move boxes for 10 hours at a measly 24.35 an hour. It's not sustainable, I do want to go back into film but it's been 2 years later with only a few side gigs worked here and there as a production assistant.  (mostly because I haven't pursued anything because of financial hardship and the steady pay is worth more to me than random amounts of 1099 based pay here and there)\n\nOn a whim, I decided to have Amazon pay me to learn how to drive a truck ( semi-drivers are also needed in film too) and at the time it just seemed to be a good thing to fall back on and I day dreamed about getting to travel again and get paid to do it.\n\nThat said, I kind of don't want to see myself as a trucker for life ( as funny as an idea that was at the time as a way to get out of back breaking labor)\n\nI was from a generation that was always told learn to code ect.... What's going on with that? I have zero interest to be a blue \"collar\" worker, and I need an extra set of skills if working BTS isn't a viable long term career (its not)\n\nI just want that desk job and that 80-100k a year. Thought of going into game dev and heard a lot of \"well don't want to do that because it'll beat that passion out of you for gaming\" don't really care about passion projects, I just want to work. Don't mind my vision being shared or not shared, just want to make money. Is coding still in, is tech dead? am I barking up the wrong tree,\n\nwould it be stupid at nearly 30 to say \"Yeah I could be a game dev if i want.\" or should I look at something else tech related or is tech just too competitive now?\n\nNo kids, no plan to ever have kids, current gf doesn't want kids.\n\nIf tech isn't it then i'll probably spend the next few years buying the film equipment I had my eye on for years, building a better pc, learning editing, working PA as often as I can and doing that grind (which trust me it's a grind, some weeks I made 200 dollars other weeks I made 3200)  But I would love the comfort of a cozy desk job.

        "content": "I joined a team and realized everything was already on fire. Other teams don't trust us due to our software never worked correctly or just right out crashed. After looking at the code base and system design, I slowly understand why. \n\nFor context, this team was built by a person and because they've been here the longest, they were the lead. \n\nThey're not even a junior developer level from my past experience working with others. It's not that I am on my high horse and judge others skills. For example, they install software dependencies during runtime. Worse, they don't pin the version or even major versions. So the software crashes at launch due to dependency conflicts at runtime. That wasn't found out after launch btw because dependencies are installed based on use case basis and they didn't test that path.\n\nAnother example is they designed the framework so that other developers have to code by writing commands that will be executed by the framework using subprocess. Not even talking about shell injection vulnerability here but it was shocking to read the software with complex logics to generate a chain of shell commands for each use case.\n\nThe entire system was thrown away after the team had to get intervention from the top architect of the company and broken down to single responsibility containers. Which tbh, any senior engineer I know would have done as a muscle memory because this is a very simple stack. Btw, they needed architect involved because no one wanted to go along with their system and they're trying to force other teams to onboard.\n\nThat's system design. They don't do well with coding either. I mean like out of school devs who just learned about OOP. They abstracted everything. Then when they realized their generalization was immature, they added hacks on top of hacks, so you have to dig into multilayer of abstraction and circular dependencies to understand what a concrete implementation of a type is.\n\nI couldn't believe it when I realized they also implemented their own openai client library, and added their own retry, batching, streaming, log probs, etc... So the software gave wrong metrics when measuring llms because they hacked it so much. Btw, we went GA with known bugs because of this.\n\nI was questioning my career choice that landed me into this team and I desperately wanted to get out. I thought every big tech company has high bar but I was so wrong, and this is considered a great company by many in this sub. I wanted to take the opportunity to fix the team to make a great case for my leadership skill, but that lead is still at the top, and they don't take my suggestions. The cycle often goes: they ignored my comments, got pushed back by other teams, get architect involved, changed design to my suggestions. Not claiming I am good, but the system is so simple, it's boring. So a decent design is obvious. My manager keeps saying she wants this team fixed but it's extremely difficult to do with my situation. My manager flip back and forth between getting rid of this lead or not. Her latest comment is she completely depends on them for planning because she has a lot of teams.\n\nI got stressed and sometimes didn't handle it professionally. I openly questioned the tasks that lead gave me because it makes no sense technically, and they always cry wolf that the tasks are urgent. It's hurting my image and connection. I will move to a different team soon but this left a terrible feeling that I might have handled this immaturely.\n\nI want to learn from this subreddit. Have you ever got into this situation, and how did you handle it well, and had a victory afterward?",

Team dynamic was also good after some time, we got to know each other better, had happy hours, etc. \n\nIn the past few months it's gotten really bad. Lots of upper management has left, some coworkers have left. Seems like things are always on fire every week. The thought of being oncall makes me cringe due to how many incidents come up. Testing environment sucks. We're dealing with tons of bad and outdated code. A project I planned fell apart at 90% completion due to is being unable to work around some outdated libraries. The system is too vast to really know what causes an issue until you look into it. It kind of feels like our team has been left behind to handle the legacy stuff whereas other teams are working on newer projects and tech. The team collab has also declined due to addition of some members. It was already tough due to WFH but now its worse\n\nI've never been too interested in work and always just took it as a means for an income. But now I feel myself really dreading waking up on workdays. I'm really starting to resent the whole thing.

I've got 15 years of experience, I'm 40, and I've been out of work for a bit after a terrible injury (an assault that left me unable to walk and suffering from PTSD) and total burnout. I've had a really tough time finding a good job. I'm frankly exhausted and not totally sure if it's just time to pivot to management, or what.\n\nI've got an offer from a solid startup -  (70 employees, obfuscated because I really don't want them to see this) with good for a good salary (220-250k?) and equity, in-office. It's not a bad commute, and I could probably do good work, but it's a JavaScript shop, even on the data platform side. The code is messy as hell. The deadlines are yesterday, according to glassdoor. Not at all my forte or favorite. They need someone to work on their data platform to make it scalable and performant. It touches AI/ML, but it's scrappy and there's lots of fires to put out.\n\nI've got another offer that's contract with **possibility** of conversion at D1sney building an observability for their streaming platform, and it's more like 170K. It's got a lot of visibility, and I'd be somewhat insulated because it's a big fucking company. I'd get to work in Scala, which is a joy and not easy to find.\n\nI'm torn. I'm getting back on the horse after a pretty bad series of uncomfortable startup experiences that ended with a lot of burnout, and the idea of going into the office every day for visibility is a lot. Hell, I'm not even sure if I want to be a software engineer.\n\nD would give me more flexibility and less pressure but it does seem like a cool project. I could pretty much take it and run with it and do some cool stuff. I'm friendly and personable.\n\nI'm just trying to get back on my feet after being out of the game for about a year. I'm not sure how ready I am to hit the ground running at a startup, and I'm not sure if it's just my lack of confidence. The flexibility of in-office when I want to be is huge, but am I daft for leaning toward contract work at a big entity with the possibility of conversion for less money, considering the reality of the grind?\n\nI don't want to burn out, but I want to make sure I'm in a good place if this contract ends. Should I get the offer from the startup? I can't really use it to leverage more from D because it's through a third party, and sanity and sustainability are my big drivers. And yeah, being able to do Scala makes me happy.\n\nThoughts?",

        "content": "In my software engineering courses in graduate school, there were frequently topics of why projects fail, and those studies had described every one of my projects to the letter. \n\nIt could be because all my employment thus far has been with consulting firms, so clients go to those when they want people they can easily unload, but I couldn't even believe that many companies could be that disorganized. \n\nMy first project I was selected for, I was supposed to be a team lead, and due to my high score on the Spring Boot interview, they made me a hiring manager, but there were no questions given to me to ask or no criteria to evaluate, and there were no projections of how many people we needed staffed.  Eventually, they found they were way over budget, they started to cut parts of the new platform little by little, and many got cut from the project and replaced with offshore even after they relocated. \n\nThe 2nd project, even after they interviewed me and told them directly that I was still rather junior level, they were expecting me to know almost everything and I had nobody on site on my team, and to get any help, I had to wait for them to be available between meetings where they had about 2 minutes to talk.  I repeated to them I never claimed to be a senior developer like they thought and eventually was released. \n\nThe 3rd project, I was on a team that had been recently split into two teams, and I asked why we needed so many people for only a couple services as it didn't seem like there'd be much to do, and they told me there was definitely going to be work to do.  After about 5 weeks, we had 2-3 people working on one user story that didn't take more than about an hour to do for one person.  My manager told me it was kind of slow, so I could use some of the time to watch Udemy videos and learn new tools while they waited for more stories to come.  Eventually, they disbanded the team because they found they didn't even need it and sent a few to other teams, and cut others including me.  The manager said she was only interested in hiring contractors from vendors, and it was apparent why. \n\n  \nSo, a few years later, every time it seemed like I'd be doing a new project to get more experience, it has all been too good to be true as they ended up being only projects that were poorly projected, disorganized, and either scrapped or switched to offshore staffing.

I'm going back to school for a BS and there are two paths. Java or C#, which would have the most longevity to learn career wise? I'm doing this in conjunction with working on some basic coding projects of my own. \n\nBackground: I have an AS in Electronics Engineering, a CCIE in Cisco stuff and a CISSP. I'm 40 years old, I did IT networking for 10 years and I've been doing IT Security for 7 years after that. My background is in Python, PowerShell, Bash and Assembly. I write a decent amount of scripts for our team to automate mundane tasks and I just honestly want to move on from the enterprise and into a product security, product owner or app security role for a technology company or large business. Any feedback is welcomed. Thanks!",

        "content": "Before writing, I'm not looking for any \"just give up it's all cooked\" or \"just put the fries in the bag\" etc. I'm aware that the job market in general is not good and even more so if you're a weak candidate like me - the question I'm trying to explore is just what to do from here. I've been struggling with what to do for a couple years since I wasn't able to get an internship, but obviously it's now coming to a head. That being said, this is half-rant half-looking for advice so I'd appreciate constructive feedback.\n\nI'm an upcoming new grad, but (aside from a capstone project with a startup and teaching web design), I don't have a ton of marketable SWE skills other than the fundamentals. I was not able to secure a proper internship during my school career, so my only real experience is with the startup, where I mostly helped design the database, user design, and implement some AI functionality.\n\nI picked computer science because I felt it was a good balance of security and things that I like. That being, I like tech and problem solving. I was never particularly passionate about software engineering in particular, but I do love debugging and building upon existing projects. But as I approach graduation in a few weeks and hundreds of applications (and some referrals) are now returning rejections, I'm not really sure where to do. And I have already been applying to anything vaguely tech related across the US, but not getting any callbacks, which I'm sure is an indication of my resume strength.\n\nI'm feeling lost like I'm sure a lot of other people are. I feel like I'm just losing out to the people who are far more experienced and passionate than me. The response to that would be to work on personal projects and hone my portfolio, but I'm honestly skeptical that would even work. Granted, I haven't put a ton of time into doing so yet as I've been focusing on school and work, so I don't actually know yet, but I see all these super experienced and talented people getting turned down all the time anyways so it's a bit defeating.\n\n**TL;DR:** My dilemma is this - I don't know if the best plan of action is just to bunker down and grind out personal projects while continuing to apply everywhere, or instead try to study a related field to try and break in there, which would be basically any role that appreciates a CS degree. Whether that's QA, tech support/IT, data analysis, etc., I think any of them could be engaging work for me still, but I think I would still need to specifically study one of them to get in.\n\nIf anyone is interested - [here's my anonymous resume](https://imgur.com/a/AZqRh80). If anyone has any tips for improving it, that would be appreciated as well. Thanks all.",

I don't want to give exact details on the private equity branch but it is a small team that is apart of a large private company that reinvests the company's extra money in private and public markets.\n\nPrivate Equity:\n\n* $90k base, $6k relocation, and performance bonus which could be 15-25%\n* LCOL city in the Midwest\n* Would be only the 2nd SWE on the team\n* Full-Stack Software Engineering and Data Engineering work\n* Work 50-55 hours regularly, could be more during crunch time\n\nCharles Schwab:\n\n* $90k base, $2k relocation, bonus up to 10%\n* Lone Tree, CO (Med-High Cost of Living)\n* Backend SWE work with Java and Spring Boot\n* Apart of NERD program, lots of support\n* Slower-paced and better WLB\n\nI'd appreciate any insights or advice, and I can answer any questions you might have. I'm worried about the lack of support and structure with the PE branch (and potentially bad WLB), but I would also be working with executives regularly and feel there would be a lot of opportunities to grow as long as I performed well. However CO is a much more attractive location to me and I think the support and training that the NERD program gives would be more beneficial as I'm starting my career.",
