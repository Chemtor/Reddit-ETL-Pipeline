        "content": "TLDR; My company wants to replace our pipelines with some all-in-one “AI agent” platform\n\nI’m a lone data engineer in a mid-size retail/logistics company that runs SAP ERP (moving to HANA soon). Historically, every department pulled SAP data into Excel, calculated things manually, and got conflicting numbers. I was hired into a small analytics unit to centralize this. I’ve automated data pulls from SAP exports, APIs, scrapers, and built pipelines into SQL Server. It’s traceable, consistent, and used regularly.\n\nNow, our new CEO wants to “centralize everything” and “go AI-driven” by bringing in a no-name platform that offers:\n\n\\- Limited source connectors for a basic data lake/warehouse setup\n\n\\- A simple SQL interface + visualization tools\n\n\\- And the worst of it all: an AI agent PER DEPARTMENT\n\nEach department will have its own AI “instance” with manually provided business context. Example: “This is how finance defines tenure,” or “Sales counts revenue like this.” Then managers are supposed to just ask the AI for a metric, and it will generate SQL and return the result. Supposedly, this will replace 95–97% of reporting, instantly (and the CTO/CEO believe it).\n\nObviously, I’m extremely skeptical:\n\n\\- Even with perfect prompts and context, if the underlying data is inconsistent (e.g. rehire dates in free text, missing fields, label mismatches), the AI will silently get it wrong.\n\n\\- There’s no way to audit mistakes, so if a number looks off, it’s unclear who’s accountable. If a manager believes it, it may go unchallenged.\n\n\\- The answer to every flaw from them is: “the context was insufficient” or “you didn’t prompt it right.” That’s not sustainable or realistic\n\n\\- Also some people (probs including me) will have to manage and maintain all the departmental context logic, deal with messy results, and take the blame when AI gets it wrong.\n\n\\- Meanwhile, we already have a working, auditable, centralized system that could scale better with a real warehouse and a few more hires. They just don't want to hire a team or I have to convince them somehow (bc they think that this is a cheaper, more efficient alternative).\n\nI’m still relatively new in this company and I feel like I’m not taken seriously, but I want to push back before we go too far, I'll switch jobs probably soon anyway but I'm actually concerned about my team.\n\nHow do I convince the management that this is a bad idea?",

Even other teams commonly call us \"devs.\"\n\nThis has me wondering:\n\nIs this just common industry language?\n\nOr is it a sign that the data engineering role is being blended into general development work?\n\nDo you also feel that your work is viewed more like backend/dev work than a specialized data role?\n\n\nJust curious how others experience this.

        "content": "Hey all, \n\nI lurk in this sub daily. I’m looking for advice / thoughts / brutally honest opinions on how to move my career forward. \n\nAbout me: 37 year old senior data engineer of 5 years, senior data analyst of about 10 years, 15 years in total working with data. Been at it since college. I have a bachelors degree in economics and a handful of certs including AWS solutions architect associate. I am married with a 1 year old, planning on having at least one more (I think this family info is relevant bc lifestyle plays into career decisions, like the one I’m trying to make). Live / work in Austin, TX. \n\nI love data engineering, and I do want to further my career in the role, but am apprehensive given all the AI f*ckery about. I have basically nailed it down to three options:\n\n1. Get a masters in CS or AI. I actually do really like the idea of this. I enjoy math, the theory and science, and having a graduate degree is an accolade I want out of life (at least I think). What holds me back: I will need to take some extra pre-req courses and will need to continue working while studying. I anticipate a 5 year track for this (and about $15-20k). This will also be difficult while raising a family. And more pertinently, does this really protect me from AI? I think it will definitely help in the medium term, but who knows if it’d be worth it ten years from now. \n\n2. Continue pressing on as a data engineer, and try to bump up to Staff and then maybe move into some sort of management role. I definitely want the staff position, but ugh being a manager does not feel like my forte. I’ve done it before as an Analytics Manager and hated it. Granted, I was much younger then, and the team I managed was not the most talented. So my last experience is probably not very representative. \n\n3. Get out of Data Engineering and move into something like Sales Engineering. This is a bit out of left field, but I think something like this is probably the best bet to future proof my tech career without an advanced degree. Personally, I haven’t had a full-on sales role before, but the sales thing is kind of in my blood, as my parents and family were quite successful in sales roles. I do enjoy people, and think I could make a successful tech salesman, given my experience as a data engineer. \n\nAfter reading this, what do you feel might be a good path for me? One or the other, a mix of both? I like the idea of going for the masters in CS and moving into Sales Engineering afterwards. \n\nOverall I am eager to learn and advance while also being mindful of the future changes coming to the industry (all industries really). \n\nThank you!",

I'm hoping to get some outside perspective on whether what I'm going through is just 'normal' in consulting, or if I'm somehow attracting all the least desirable projects.\n\nI've been working at a tech consulting firm (or 'IT services company,' as I'd call it) for 3 years, supposedly as a Data Engineer. And honestly, my experiences so far have been... peculiar.”\n\nMy first year was a baptism by fire. I was thrown into a legacy migration project, essentially picking up mid-way after two people suddenly left the company. This meant I spent my days migrating processes from unreadable SQL and Java to PySpark and Python. The code was unmaintainable, full of bad practices, and the PySpark notebooks constantly failed because, obviously, they were written by people with no real Spark expertise. Debugging that was an endless nightmare.\n\nThen, a small ray of light appeared: I participated in a project to build a data platform on AWS. I had to learn Terraform on the fly and worked closely with actual cloud architects and infrastructure engineers. I learned a ton about infrastructure as code and, finally, felt like I was building something useful and growing professionally. I was genuinely happy!\n\nBut the joy didn't last. My boss decided I needed to move to something \"more data-oriented\" (his words). And that's where I am now, feeling completely demoralized.\n\nCurrently, I'm on a team working with Microsoft Fabric, surrounded by Power BI folks who have very little to no programming experience. Their philosophy is \"low-code for everything,\" with zero automation. They want to build a Medallion architecture and ingest over 100 tables, using one Dataflow Gen2 for EACH table. Yes, you read that right.\n\nThis translates to:\n- Monumental development delays.\n- Cryptic error messages and infernal debugging (if you've ever tried to debug a Dataflow Gen2, you know what I mean).\n- A strong sense that we're creating massive technical debt from day one.\n\nI've tried to explain my vision, pushed for the importance of automation, reducing technical debt, and improving maintainability and monitoring. But it's like talking to a wall. It seems the technical lead, whose background is solely Power BI, doesn't understand the importance of these practices nor has the slightest intention of learning.\n\nI feel like, instead of progressing, I'm actually moving backward professionally. I love programming with Python and PySpark, and designing robust, automated solutions. But I keep landing on ETL projects where quality is non-existent, and I see no real value in what we're doing—just \"quick fixes and shoddy work.\"\n\nI have the impression that I haven't experienced what true data engineering is yet, and that I'm professionally devaluing myself in these kinds of environments.\n\nMy main questions are:\n\n- Is this just my reality as a Data Engineer in consulting, or is there a path to working on projects with good practices and real automation?\n- How can I redirect my career to find roles where quality code, automation, and robust design are valued?\n- Any advice on how to address this situation with my current company (if there's any hope) or what to actively look for in my next role?\n\nAny similar experiences, perspectives, or advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!\n",

Obviously, dbt wouldn’t have changed their license to ELv2 if they weren’t confident that fusion was the strongest SQL-based transformation engine.\n\nSo this brings me to my question- for the core functionality of understanding SQL, does anyone know the technological/architectural differences between the two? How they differ in approaches? Their limitations? Where one’s implementation is better than the other?",

This time, I already have the title, so expectations are higher from day one.\n\nI’d appreciate advice from others who’ve gone through similar transitions. A few points I’m navigating:\n\n1. **More coordination, less coding** – I feel responsible when junior/mid-level teammates struggle, but stepping in often requires deep context and isn’t always the best use of my time.\n2. **Initial pressure to speak up** – In early meetings, I spoke a lot out of fear of being judged. I’ve since shifted to only contributing when others are stuck, letting the team lead conversations.\n3. **High-stakes communication** – I’m regularly presenting and defending solutions to groups of 5–10 senior stakeholders (including weekly 2-3 min updates to 100+ people). I feel it is it's own skillset and would like tips or recommendations on courses for such situations.\n4. **Perception concerns** – I’m worried my informal tone and young appearance (I'm 28 but look 24) might make me seem immature for the role.\n\nLooking for strategies to succeed as a new senior in a new team.",

Can schedule 1:1 with the coaches.\n- Group sessions to cover common Data Engineering related concepts.\n\nCons\n\n- They have multiple courses related to DE, but the bronze plan does not have access to it. This is not mentioned anywhere in the contract, and you get to know only after joining and paying the amount.\nWhen I asked why can’t I access and why is this not menioned in the contract, their response was, it is written in the contract what we offer, which is misleading. \nIn the initial calls before joining, they emphasized more on these courses as an highlight.\n\n- Had to ping multiple times to get a basic review on CV.\n\n- 1:1 session can only be scheduled twice with a coach. There are many students enrolled now, and very few coaches are available. Sometimes, the availability of the coaches is more than 2 weeks away.\n\n- Coaches and their teams response time is quite slow. Sometimes the coaches don’t even respond. Only 1:1 was a good experience.\n\n- Sometimes the group sessions gets cancelled with no prior information, and they provide no platform to check if the session will begin or not.\n\n- Job application process and their follow ups are below average. They did not follow the job location preference and where just randomly appling to any DE role irrespective of which level you belong to.\n\n- For the job applications, they initially showed a list of referrals supported, but were not using that during the application process. Had to intervene multiple times, and then only a few of those companies from the referral list were used. \n\n- Had to start applying on my own, as their job search process was not that reliable.\n\n————————————————————————\nOverall, except the 1:1 with the coaches, I felt there was no benefit. They take a hughe amount, instead taking multiple online DE courses would have been a better option.",

        "content": "\nHi,\n\nI had some fun creating a Python tool that hides a secret payload in a DataFrame. The message is encoded based on row order, so the data itself remains unaltered.\n\nThe payload can be recovered even if some rows are modified or deleted, thanks to a combination of Reed-Solomon and fountain codes. You only need a fraction of the original dataset—regardless of which part—to recover the payload.\n\nFor example, I managed to hide a 128×128 image in a Parquet file containing 100,000 rows.\n\nI believe this could be used to watermark a Parquet file with a signature for authentication and tracking. The payload can still be retrieved even if the file is converted to CSV or SQL.\n\nThat said, the payload is easy to remove by simply reshuffling all the rows. However, if you maintain the original order using a column such as an ID, the encoding will remain intact.\n\nHere’s the package, called Steganodf (like steganography for DataFrames :) ):\n\n🔗 https://github.com/dridk/steganodf\n\n\nLet me know what you think!\n",

I can prioritize all our games only and that should be 350 GB data (I think) now ofcourse it wouldn’t be uploaded all at once but based off of last years data I have not seen a singular game file over 11.5 GB. I’m unsure how much practice footages we have but I’ll see. \n\nOh also I put our files in ChatGPT and it’s “.SCTimeline , stream.json , video.json and package meta” Chat game me a hopefully this information helps.

        "content": "I recently finished my degree in Computer Science and worked part-time throughout my studies, including on many personal projects in the data domain. I’m very confident in my technical skills: I can (and have) built large systems and my own SaaS projects. I know all the ins and outs of the basic data-engineering tools, SQL, Python, Pandas, PySpark, and have experience with the entire software-engineering stack (Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes, even front-end). I also have a solid grasp of statistics.\n\nAbout a year ago, I was hired at a company that had previously outsourced all IT to external firms. I got the job through the CEO of a company where I’d interned previously. He’s now the CTO of this new company and is building the entire IT department from scratch. The reason he was hired is to transform this traditional company, whose industry is being significantly disrupted by tech, into a “tech” company. You can really tell the CEO cares about that: in a little over one year, we’ve grown to 15+ developers, and the culture has changed a lot.\n\nI now have the privilege of being trusted with the responsibility of building the entire data infrastructure from scratch. I have total authority over all tech decisions, although I don’t have much experience with how mature data teams operate. Since I’m a total open-source nerd and we’re based in Europe, we want to rely on as few American cloud providers as possible, I’ve set up the current infrastructure like this:\n\n* **Airflow** (running in our Kubernetes cluster)\n* **ClickHouse DWH** (also running in our Kubernetes cluster)\n* **Spark** (you guessed it, running in our cluster)\n* **Goose** for SQL migrations in our warehouse\n\nSome conceptual decisions I’ve made so far:\n\n1. Data ingestion from different sources (Salesforce, multiple products, etc.) runs through Airflow, using simple Pandas scripts to load into the DWH (about 200 k rows per day).\n2. ClickHouse is our DWH, and Spark connects to ClickHouse so that all analytics runs through Spark against ClickHouse. If you have any tips on how to structure the different data layers (Ingestion/datamart etc), please!\n\nWhat I want to implement next are typical software-engineering practices, dev/prod environments, testing, etc. As I mentioned, I have a lot of experience in classical SWE within corporate environments, so I want to apply as much from that as possible. In my research, I’ve found that you basically just copy the entire environment for dev and prod, which makes sense, but sounds expensive computing wise. We will soon start hiring additional DE/DA/DS.\n\nMy question is: What technical or organizational decisions do you think are important and valuable? What have you seen work (or not work) in your experience as a data engineer? Are there problems you only discover once your team has grown? I want to get in front of those issues as early as possible. Like I said, I have a lot of experience in how to build SWE projects in a corporate environment. Any things I am not thinking about that will sooner or later come to haunt me in my DE team? Any tips on how to setup my DWH architecture? How does your DWH look conceptually?",

We have our own infra to contain Kafka Connect connectors, both for source connectors (Debezium PostgreSQL, MySQL) and sink connectors (BigQuery)\n\nFor our case, the data from productiin DB are read by Debezium and produced into Kafka topics, and then got written directly by sink processes into BigQuery in short-lived temporary tables -- which data is then merged into a analytics-ready table and flushed.\n\nFor starters, do we have some sort of Iceberg migration guide with similar setup like above (data coming from Kafka topics)?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey all,\n\nI've been learning Spark/PySpark recently and I'm curious about how production projects are typically structured and organized.\n\nMy background is in DBT, where each model (table/view) is defined in a SQL file, and DBT builds a DAG automatically using `ref()` calls. For example:\n\n    -- modelB.sql\n    SELECT colA FROM {{ ref('modelA') }}\n    \n\nThis ensures `modelA` runs before `modelB`. DBT handles the dependency graph for you, parallelizes independent models for faster builds, and allows for targeted runs using tags. It also supports automated tests defined in YAML files, which run before the associated models.\n\nI'm wondering how similar functionality is achieved in Databricks. Is lineage managed manually, or is there a framework to define dependencies and parallelism? How are tests defined and automatically executed? I'd also like to understand how this works in vanilla Spark without Databricks.\n\n  \nTLDR - How are Databricks or vanilla Spark projects organized in production. How are things like 100s of tables, lineage/DAGs, orchestration, and tests managed?\n\nThanks!",

I’m ambitious and constantly learning, and I want to grow fast and reach high-impact roles, ideally abroad in the future.\n\nSome questions I’m grappling with:\n\t•\tAre certifications (like the Snowflake one) worth it for standing out?\n\t•\tWould a private master’s or MBA from a well-known school help open doors, even if I’m not doing it for the learning itself? If so, which ones are actually respected in the data world?\n\t•\tI’m also working on personal projects (investment tools, dashboards) that I use for myself and publish on GitHub. Is it worth adapting them for the public or making them more portfolio-ready?\n\nI’d love to hear from others who were in a similar position: what helped you stand out?

        "content": "Hey folks,\n\nI'm leading a greenfield initiative to build a modern data engineering platform at a medium sized healthcare organization, and I’d love to crowdsource some insights from this community — especially from those who have done something similar or witnessed it done well (or not-so-well 😬).\n\nWe're designing from scratch, so I have a rare opportunity (and responsibility) to make intentional decisions about architecture, tooling, processes, and team structure. This includes everything from ingestion and transformation patterns, to data governance, metadata, access management, real-time vs. batch workloads, DevOps/CI-CD, observability, and beyond.\n\n**Our current state:** We’re a heavily on-prem SQL Server shop with a \\~40 TB relational reporting database . We have a small Azure footprint but aren’t deeply tied to it — so we’re not locked in to a specific cloud or architecture and have some flexibility to choose what best supports scalability, governance, and long-term agility.\n\nWhat I’m hoping to tap into from this community:\n\n* “I wish we had done X from the start”\n* “Avoid Y like the plague”\n* “One thing that made a huge difference for us was…”\n* “Nobody talks about Z, but it became a big problem later”\n* “If I were doing it again today, I would definitely…”\n\nWe’re evaluating options for lakehouse architectures (e.g., Snowflake, Azure, DuckDB/Parquet, etc.), building out a scalable ingestion and transformation layer, considering dbt and/or other semantic layers, and thinking hard about governance, security, and how we enable analytics and AI down the line.\n\nI’m also interested in team/process tips. What did you do to build healthy team workflows? How did you handle documentation, ownership, intake, and cross-functional communication in the early days?\n\nAppreciate any war stories, hard-won lessons, or even questions you wish someone had asked you when you were just getting started. Thanks in advance — and if it helps, I’m happy to follow up and share what we learn along the way.\n\n– OP",

To me this seems like a standard practice, as long as you are maintaining the grain of the table (1 customer per record). I also might use this table to join in all of the ids from various source systems. This makes it easy to investigate issues and increases the tables reusability IMO.\n\nAm I misunderstanding the article maybe, or is there a better, more scalable approach than what I'm currently doing in my own work?\n\n  \nThanks!",

May 15th business data originally extracted on May 15th → goes to May 15th partition\n2. Backfill more May 15th data on June 1st → goes to June 1st partition\n3. Incremental run on June 2nd only processes June 1st/2nd partitions\n4. Result: Duplicate May 15th business dates across different extraction partitions\n\n**What I've tried:**\n\n* Custom backfill detection logic (complex, had issues)\n* Changing filter logic (performance problems)\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Is there a clean way to handle this pattern without full refresh?\n2. Should I be partitioning by business date instead of extraction date?\n3. Would switching to `merge` strategy be better here?\n4. Any other approaches to handle backfills gracefully?\n\nThe latest record pattern works great for the source tables, but the extraction-date partitioning on insights tables creates this blind spot. Backfills are rare so considering just doing full refresh when they happen, but curious if there's a more elegant solution.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "author": "UnusualIntern362",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "\nHi everyone,\nI’m working as a data engineer on a project that follows a Medallion Architecture in Synapse, with bronze and silver layers on Spark, and the gold layer built using Serverless SQL.\n\nFor a specific task, the requirement is to replicate multiple source views exactly as they are — without applying transformations or modeling — directly from the source system into the gold layer. In this case, the silver layer is being skipped entirely, and the gold layer will serve as a 1:1 technical copy of the source views.\n\nWhile working on the development, I noticed that some of these source views contain duplicate records. I recommended introducing logical business keys to ensure uniqueness and preserve data quality, even though we’re not implementing dimensional modeling. However, the team responsible for the source system insists that the views should be replicated as-is and that it’s unnecessary to define any keys at all.\n\nI’m not convinced this is a good approach, especially for a layer that will be used for downstream reporting and analytics.\n\nWhat would you do in this case?\nWould you still enforce some form of business key validation in the gold layer, even when doing a simple pass-through replication?\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "content": "TL;DR: We have a website and a D365 CRM that we currently keep synchronized through Power Automate, and this is rather terrible. What's a good avenue for better centralising our data for reporting? And what would be a good tool for pulling this data into the central data source?\n\nAs the title says, we work in procurement for education institutions providing frameworks and the ability to raise tender requests free of charge, while collecting spend from our suppliers.\n\nOur development team is rather small with about 2-3 web developers (including our tech lead) and a data analyst. We have good experience in PHP / SQL, and rather limited experience in Python (although I have used it).\n\nWe have our main website, a Laravel site that serves as the main point of contact for both members and suppliers with a Quote Tool (raising tenders) and Spend Reporter (suppliers tell us their revenue through us). The data for this is currently in a MariaDB / MySQL database. The VM for this is currently hosted within Azure.\n\nWe then have our CRM, a dynamics 365 / PowerApps Model App(?) that handles Member & Supplier data, contacts, and also contains the framework data same as the site. Of course, this data is kept in Microsoft Data verse.\n\nThese 2 are kept in sync using an array of Power Automate flows that run whenever a change is made on either end, and attempts to synchronise the two. It uses an API built in Laravel to contact the website data. To keep it realtime, there's an Azure Service bus for the messages sent on either end. A custom connector is used to access the API in Power Automate.\n\nWe also have some other external data sources such as information from other organisations we pull into Microsoft Dataverse using custom connectors or an array of spreadsheets we get from them.\n\nFinally, we also have sources such as SharePoint, accounting software, MailChimp, a couple of S3 buckets, etc, that would be relevant to at least mention.\n\nOur reports are generally built in Power BI. These reports are generally built using the MySQL server as a source (although they have to be manually refreshed when connecting through an SSH tunnel) for some, and the Dataverse as the other source.\n\nWe have licenses to build PowerBI reports that ingest data from any source, as well as most of the power platform suite. However, we don't have a license for Microsoft Fabric at the moment.\n\nWe also have an old setup of Synapse Analytics alongside an Azure SQL database that as far as I can tell neither of these are really being utilised right now.\n\nSo, my question from here is: \nwhat's our best option moving forward for improving where we store our data and how we keep it synchronised? We've been looking at Snowflake as an option for a data store as well as (maybe?) for ETL/ELT. Alternatively, the option of Microsoft Fabric to try to keep things within Microsoft / Azure, despite my many hangups with trusting it lol.\n\nAdditionally, a big requirement is moving away from Power Automate for handling real time ETL processes as this causes far too many problems than solutions. Ideally, the 2-way sync would be kept as close to real-time as possible.\n\nSo, what would be a good option for central data storage? And what would be a good option for then running data synchronisation and preparation for building reports?\n\nI think options that have been on the table either from personal discussions or with a vendor are:\n\n- including Azure Data Factory alongside Synapse for ETL\n- Microsoft Fabric \n- Snowflake\n- Trying to use FOSS tools to build our own stack, (difficult, we're a small team)\n- using more Power Query (simple, but only for ingesting data into Dataverse)\n\nI can answer questions for any additional context if needed, because I can imagine more will be needed.",

Integrations are SSIS packages and scripts that are kind of in version control, data testing is manual, data analysts have no ability to define or alter tables even though they know the SQL. \n\nThe business is expanding! It's a good place to be. As we expand, it's challenging our existing model. Our speed of execution is showing the bottlenecks around the DBA team, with one Hero Dev doing the majority of the work. They're wrapped up in application changes, warehouse changes, and analytics changes, and feel like they have to touch every part of the process or else everything will break (because again, tests are manual and we're only kind of doing version control).\n\nI'm working with the team on how we can address this. My plan is something like:\n\n* Break responsibility apart into the different teams\n   * Application team is responsible for the application DB\n   * DBA team is responsible for the system of record data warehouse and integrations and consults on design decisions\n   * Analytics team is responsible for reports, \\*including any underlying SQL and reporting warehouse structure\\*\n* Advocate for my Hero Dev to take a promotion towards a data architect and design consulting role bridging the teams, with other DBA's taking on more of the development.\n* Work on adding automated testing to our existing SSIS packages, then work towards having them built into a CI/CD process\n* Work with the analyst team on having their own server + database where they can use a framework or even Fabric to manage their tables and semantic layer themselves.\n\nI acknowledge this is a super high-level plan with a lot of hand-waving.

I dont need scalability at this time.\n\nI have a requirement to design a data warehouse in redshift that supports the ability to query past data states similarly to temporal tables in MS SQL Server. (if an update query is made, I need to be able to query for what the table looked like before the update) this is sometimes called \"time travel query\" or \"point in time architecture\" depending on your background. The data sources do not retain this historical data, and are not in an ideal data warehouse schema, so Ill need to transform the data either before or after loading it, and maintain the historical records. Redshift seems to lack a direct solution for this problem.\n\na second requirement is to ingest the data using streaming technology such as kafka. though the data warehouse does not have to be updated in real time. that is optional.\n\nI have looked at redshift's \"history mode\" but its quite new and it looks like all the data would need to go into RDS first, which has tradeoffs. but one of the main data sources is already on RDS, so that seems promising.\n\ntotal data volume is low, no need for cluster computing if we can save some complexity.\n\nI would prefer to lean toward python and sql for programming.\n\nI would prefer to do things in real-time, but would accept batches if a particularly elegant solution is available.\n\nthanks for considering :D",

        "content": "Hey everyone. Before saying anything I would like to preface that this is my first time posting in a subreddit, so if I did something wrong somehow I apologize in advance (I chose the resource tag because my main question concerns choosing resources to learn).\n\nI have currently completed my second year in uni and am in the midst of my 3-month summer break. I want to spend these three months focusing on learning full stack development (which for now is my career goal ig), and specifically web development. I have this obsession with doing online courses and improving my skills to get better, and I'm also really looking to do some solid projects and start building my resume/cv. \n\nI scoured the internet and found multiple recommended courses which I've listed below. Unfortunately I have a bad habit of just hoarding work and trying to do everything without a plan and regardless of whether it is redundant or not. Here are the courses I gathered:\n\n- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)\n- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)\n- [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j:toc)\n- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn) courses (HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript)\n- [CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/) -> [CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)\n- [Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript and FrontEnd course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/)\n- [freecodecamp Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/)\n- The roadmap on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)\n- [This roadmap](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/vcu5lm/comment/icgeukp/?context=3) by NiagaraThistle\n\nI want to know which of these courses would be enough for me to become skilled at web dev and also set me on the path to becoming a full stack dev. I'd like to know if just one of these courses is actually enough, or if a few are enough then in what sequence should I do them. Of course if I had infinite time I would probably do them all but as of now this is overwhelming and would really appreciate if this could be narrowed down to the absolute essentials, stuff I can feasibly do in < 3 months and still get something out of. I'm aware that TOP seems well praised universally so I'm definitely going to do that.\n\nTo preface I'm fairly adequate in programming and have worked on a few projects, including web-based ones, but I'm really looking to rebuild my skills from scratch if that makes sense.\nI also understand that the best way to learn is through building projects, I get that but I'd like to supplement that with learning theoreticals and any courses from the above (or if there's some other amazing one I somehow missed) which also involve project building would be best. I'd also like to know where I can find some project ideas (I'm aware roadmap.sh has a few). I'd like to build at least 3 projects within the time I have.\n\nAgain would really appreciate some help (if I seem rather clueless in this post it's probably because I am, sorry, any guidance is appreciated)\n",

        "content": "I'm not here to ask the usual, lazy  \"learned  programming at 26! how become better programmer! also how get job?\" Because, yeah, I know how to become a better programmer: \"do projects,\" they all say. \"Solve a real world problem that you have.\" But every legitimate programmer out there needs to acknowledge that there's a world of computer general knowledge that's typically necessary for many of these \"projects\" to function. Sure, at my level (<1 year of programming; yes I am self taught, no I did not get a CS degree), I can  create a terminal based RPG game or create a terminal based CRUD. But when programmers go out and build a compiler, there's a whole world of knowledge required on how to do that, none of which is probably even concretely understandable - only abstractly understandable. To take another example: if you want to get into web development, it is not enough to know JS, HTML, and CSS - one must also know how requests/get/server/browsers work. \n\nSo how does one bridge the gap from being a programmer who can only create a terminal CRUD to becoming a programmer that understands how to build something like a compiler? \n\nMaybe my question is vague because it lacks an objective. I'm sure many of you will say \"what do you want to DO? What's your goal? That will determine how you learn this under-the-hood stuff.\" And yet in the same breath, I suspect most programmers out there have this under-the-hood knowledge that I seem to lack. Where is this knowledge? YouTube tutorials on \"how to build [complicated thingy],\" by necessity, gloss over the important details behind the inner workings of lines of code, because otherwise the video would rabbit-hole quite quickly.

For every function I started, Copilot would try to write the entire function for me even when I didn’t want it to.\n\nIt honestly feels like the AI is coding the whole program for me. If you're already good at programming, you might find this tool helpful. But if you're just starting out, I think it's actually a bad idea. It takes away the learning-by-doing aspect of coding. If the AI just writes everything, you're not really practicing or understanding how things work.\n\nSure, it’s subjective some people might take the time to understand the code Copilot generates.

I've already graduated from a university (not IT/CS degree, though I'm very much familiar with PC) and am a working person. I'm well aware that C++ is one of the most difficult ones, or at least people say so, but I'm sure this is exactly what I want. JavaScript, Python, C, C#, Swift, and Kotlin - the ones I've considered. So far, I use [learncpp.com](http://learncpp.com) and [freeCodeCamp.org](https://youtu.be/8jLOx1hD3_o?si=1Re0s6gKsD-iH1xZ) C++ beginner to advice video guide. I've also created accounts on [HackerRank ](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)and [LeetCode ](https://leetcode.com/)websites to practice solving problems in the future. I'm already planning on signing up for a C++ course next year, but for now I think I'm capable of learning the very basic fundamental things on my own.\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n1. Is it actually better to sign up for a course ASAP and not wait until 2026 to avoid getting lost while trying to learn on my own? So far, it's going great but I'm learning the very basic stuff like comments, errors and warnings, input and output, and so on, so it is supposed to be easy as far as I understand.  \n2. Is it possible to find a job without any programming related degree but with finished courses and a portfolio of projects? To be even more specific, should I also start planning on getting a second degree or is it not necessary?  \n3. Any more free sources where I can learn C++ on my own? I know there're a lot of them, but from reading forums and dicussions people have different opinions on all sources of leaning, which I guess is to be expected.\n\nThat's pretty much it, but I'd appreciate any sort of advice you might have. Thank you for taking your time to go through my post!",

Some are C language developed projects, some are c++ (open source games mostly).\n\nSo here's where I'm stuck: From what I gather, c++ is more difficult overall for a beginner to learn than c, but the open source projects I would be interested in that are in c are likely more difficult to get a handle on as a beginner. So I'm not sure if I go with the higher difficulty lang or higher skill-floor projects? Secondly, I'm on an absolute poopoo of a laptop :D it's this old thinkpad I'm going to strip and put linux on.

(wish I had this stuff 20 years ago when I tried this the last time!) However I want to try and get as deep as I can with learning CS and contributing as quickly as I can so I want to focus on just one technology or stack. \n\nSuggestions or input? \n\nThanks!",

Ive been trying to do my own research into the field (mostly by googling) to deepen my understanding, but, honestly, I have no idea where to really start. I think I have a reasonable grasp on C++, Java, and Python, and can create programs that typically do what I want in the console, but where do I progress from there? Where do I focus my independent studying next to become an effective engineer? And once I have an area of focus, where do I start? \n\nTo be more specific, when learning a coding language, typically the classes I've taken start by teaching you different variables, then move on to teaching if-else branches, then loops, etc. How do I figure out what the equivalent would be for learning, say, how to create user interfaces, or accessing databases through code, or other things that go into making a program that I'm not aware of? \n\nI hope that makes sense, any advice would be appreciated. \n\nEdit: I suppose I should also mention that I HAVE picked up a book, specifically the Pragmatic Programmer, but from what I've read it seems primarily best-practice and mindset oriented, where I'm looking to improve on the technical side as well.",

In the span of 6 months life happened, got my first car stolen, failed my first course(same time my car got stolen), and more..(life happens to everyone so no big deal just takes time). As it's my last semester, I'm trying to get back into my groove of programming and building meaningful projects, which in my head i was over complicating things(is learning c++ better than..? Is making your own compiler better? Is making an application or full stack application with users better? which stack is better to use?) then i came across this growing tech youtuber that was offering paid mentorship. \n\nWhat made him stand out to me? His idea in building application by yourself with guidance. He will collaborate with you in helping you build your idea. It also came to my head that maybe he can guide me in what are things i need to improve on? because I love getting better every single day no matter how small it is. Its just I dont know how to improve or what to improve on... Its like in sports you can determine what to improve on. But with programming i cant determine it. I'm coming to this mentorship with this mindset, but then when i got in and i was questioning if i should continue even though it wasnt even a week yet? Why? Because one of the first module is basic javascript, html and css, which of course i understand that it is needed to have that \"hidden handshake\" that you know what you're doing. So i felt is this only for people transitioning from other jobs to tech? or trying out tech? The other modules are locked until certain days. I've built numerous full stack application using react, node, mongoDB, Vue, Springboot, PHP Laravel because it was a project for my classes. In which, I haven't touched up on it for 6 months. I was taking theory based classes in the 2 semester i wasnt programing/coding(Of course its only an excuse i know).\n\nWhich currently before i bit the bullet doing the mentorship, I'm learning react native because i got an idea for an app and i want to leverage Java spring boot in it because that's my most backend ive done.\n\nIn so, my main predicament is should i continue doing the beginner modules of html, css and javascript(again context of ive learnt this in the past already so) or continue learning react native and retouch my skills in using Java(spring boot) to fully make the app or ask the mentor how i should move forward in this program in regards of my skills currently? Idk what to prioritize... plus i still have my last semester.\n\n  \nAny feedback or criticism is welcome :) pls..",

I particularly struggle with OOP and abstracting what I want from a system into various aspects. Concepts as a whole tend to confuse me at first and I need a real concrete understanding before \"getting it\". This leads to me feeling stupid for taking so long whereas others seem more able to understand new concepts, regardless of the topic being taught (although that could just be perceived). \n\nWhat steps can I take to improving this skill and understanding / reasoning with concepts in a way that doesn't require in-depth knowledge? I hope my question comes across clear, but please let me know if other wise and I will try and clear that up.\n\nMany thanks",

However, im quite set on aiming for the security-related job prospects upon graduation. Be it to cloud security, soc analyst, GRC etc. I decided on this pathway rather than going heads on into a cybersecurity degree because it will be extremely inflexible due to the lack of depth on computer knowledge it offers as it only focuses on that niche field. \n\nI wanted to ask if any of y'all would be able to share your pathway/experience in jumping into this. I have somewhat carved out a path which will be getting myself involved in certifications like comptia/aws/oscp before graduation (eventho thats going to be extremely stressful given the course difficulty haha). But other than that, my degree only covers a small aspect of security - like two units. I could use any of your feedback heh thanks :)",

        "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm new to programming and drawn to the field because I'm fascinated by how programmers can envision ideas and bring them to life through code. However, I'm struggling with two main challenges that are holding me back.\n\nFirst, I'm having trouble with the fundamentals of problem-solving and breaking down complex tasks. Despite watching tutorials, reading forums, and attempting LeetCode problems, everything feels overwhelming. I suspect I need to start even more basic than most beginners - perhaps at what I'd call a \"level -1.\" To address this, I'm planning to work with a tutor who can help me build a solid foundation before I try to learn independently.\n\nSecond, I'm unsure about which programming specialization to pursue. This uncertainty stems partly from my lack of confidence, but I now understand that working on personal projects is crucial for growth. Previously, I relied solely on LeetCode and books like \"How to Think Like a Programmer\" by Anton Spraul, but this community has shown me these should only supplement hands-on practice, not replace it.\n\nMy main question is: Can I develop core programming skills that would transfer to any specialization I eventually choose - whether that's web development, DevOps, cloud engineering, or something else? Would it be better to pick a beginner-friendly area like web development to start with, or are there specific foundational projects and practices that would serve me well regardless of my eventual path?\n\nI'm open to any guidance you can offer, and I plan to utilize resources like tutoring, online communities, and Discord servers to support my learning journey.",

I'm in my first semester of an Associate's Degree in Systems Analysis and Development (ADS), taking a JS/HTML/CSS course, and trying to build a project for my wife's company.\n\nADS Degree: I'm pretty much half-assing this first semester because of the subjects. I just let the lectures play in the background while I do other things, then I take the test and that's it.\n\nJS/HTML/CSS Course: I started with a programming logic course and then jumped straight into this one.\n\nThe Project: I'm building it with the help of Gemini Pro, and I think it's a relatively simple project. It's being developed with several technologies like Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and others.\n\nWhat I'd like to get your opinion on is this: I've paused my JS/HTML/CSS course to focus on the project, because everyone keeps saying the best way to learn is to get your hands dirty. Since I have no experience, I ask the AI to give me a step-by-step guide of what we're going to do, followed by the code with a line-by-line explanation of its functionality. I finish by writing the lines myself and questioning some parts (which has led to more work, as I end up making it more robust than the AI's initial version and then have to make changes throughout the project).\n\nDo you think I should carry on like this, or should I go back to the course and build smaller projects related to the lessons? And also, should I be doing LeetCode/Codewars, etc.?\n\nI really appreciate anyone who read all of this, and even more so anyone who's willing to reply. :)",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Disclaimer: I still consider myself \"new\" to programming. I'm not an expert by any means. I just want to share my story.\n\nEver since I started listening to discussions surrounding memory management, I've had a growing interest in C/C++. Several months ago, I began studying open source C++ repositories and trying to put together all the pieces of a mostly complete program. \n\nIt was a disaster, honestly. I quickly came to realize that my first impression of programming was overly simplistic and due for a refactor. I depended on the verbose nature of Java more than I thought I did. I took for granted all the things the Java Virtual Machine handled automatically until I was introduced to header files and Cmake. I'd argue this is one of the most important recognitions I've made about programming in general so far. It made me focus more on compiler behavior, pre-compile tasks, and all the madness going on in the terminal rather than just how good I can code, follow exception messages or solve surface level problems.\n\nMy advice for new learners of C or C++: \n\n1. Be very patient with it. Take extended breaks (burnout can occur quickly)\n\n2. The coding part will mostly be simple following a tutorial. It's everything else regarding the compiler tasks, headers, proper linking, and so on that will be troubling because it's not common for Java programmers to deal with that.\n\n3. Reading code others wrote in C++ will be madness, but it is necessary for learning. Stay resilient. You'll eventually start following the logic more easily.\n\n4. There are several C/C++ compilers out there. make sure you're choosing the one the project you're looking at expects. It's been an unexpected sticking point for me. People say the compiler won't make any meaningful difference in performance, which can be mistaken as saying the compiler choice doesn't matter at all. It will matter, just not for performance.\n\n5. Cmake is a friend, not a foe. Follow its instructions and download the CMake UI so you can see all the missing data at once. It'll mostly be seen in large projects.\n\n6. Building a project is less about the code itself and more about file linking. Pointing the compiler to all associated files is top priority to learn (in my opinion)\n\n7. C/C++ makes no assumptions about your platform. That's more significant than I first imagined. It's another thing the JVM handles under the hood\n\nIf I am misguided about any of this, please let me know. Drop some stories in the comments about your learning experience as well and I'll happily read them",

I like to use ai as an assistant but some of the posts I read straight up saying they have 0 knowledge and the ai did all the work of 8 months in 72 hours... what are your thoughts on this situation?

I'm not sure why I'm writing this post, but I feel like all the tech \"influencers\" of 2021 glamorized this career to unrealistic expectations, and I need to correct some of the preconceived notions.\n\nThe last 3 years have been absolutely brutal in terms of declining engineering culture. What's worse is that the toxicity is creating a feedback loops that exacerbates the declining culture.\n\nSome of the crazy things I've heard\n\n* \"I want to you look at every one of your report and ask yourself, is this person producing enough value to justify their high compensations\" (director to his managers)\n* \"If that person doesn't have the right skills, get rid of them and we'll find someone that does\" (VP to an entire organization after pivoting technology direction). \n   * I.e. - It's not worth training people anymore, even if they're talented and can learn anything new. It's all sink or swim now\n* \"If these candidates aren't willing to grind hundreds of leetcode questions, they don't have mental fortitude to handle this job\" (engineers to other engineers)\n   * To be fair, I felt like this was a defense mechanism. The amount of BS that you need to put up with to not get laid off has grown significantly.\n* \"Working nights and weekends is expected\" (manager to my coworker that was on PIP because he didn't work weekends).\n   * I've always felt this pressure previously. But I've never heard it truly be verbalized until recently.\n\n  \nFinal thoughts\n\n* Software engineering in big tech feels more akin to investment banking now. Most companies expect this to be your life. You truly have to be \"passionate\" about making a bunch of money, or \"passionate\" about the product to survive.\n* Don't get too excited if your company stock skyrockets. The leaders of the company will continue to pinch every bit of value out of you because they're technically paying you more now (e.g. meta) and they know that the job market is harsh.\n* Prior to 2022, Amazon was considered the most toxic big tech company. But ironically, their multiple layers of bureaucracy and stagnating stock price likely prevented the the culture from getting too much worse, whereas many other companies have drastically exceeded Amazon in terms of toxicity in 2025. IMO, Amazon is solidly 50th percentile in terms of culture now. If you couldn't handle Amazon culture prior to 2022, then you definitely can't handle the type of culture that exists now.",

During one of the meeting someone asked about our current position, in which someone from the now parent company says “we are really diving head first into Ai so I would urge you all to look at career opportunities on our webpage” we go to the webpage they only hire devs in India. So again us devs talk and I’m like “dude we got til Jan 1 and we toast might as well brush up on some leet code and system design” but all the devs here think they are crossing over to the parent company, our dev ops engineer met with they dev ops engineer to walk him through all of our process then made diagrams from him.. I could be over reacting, anyone else been through an acquisition?",

I learned so much in such little time and picked up so many soft skills, such as how to consult different engineers and compile their knowledge to properly add new features to infra way too big for any 1 dev to have 100% knowledge on.\n\nBut my manager squeezed and sucked all of that passion out of me. I’ve tried my best to work on our relationship, but he’s spent all year treating me with explicit disdain, not making eye contact, and ignoring whatever I say in team lunches.\n\nI buckled down as much as I could to do better, but every 1:1 became a condescending berating session and I never felt like I truly belonged on the team.\n\nWhenever features were delayed, the majority of the time it was because of consistently broken infra, incomplete features from sister teams that mine depended on to start, or inaccurate guidance from dev’s I was asked to consult. I accepted the weaknesses within my control and improved them, but no matter what I did, I could never beat the narrative.\n\nAnything I did good was sarcastically devalued and whenever anything went wrong, my manager would tell me I should’ve taken X action that I wouldn’t have known to do at the time without privileged knowledge or time travel (hindsight advice).\n\nCoworkers and mentor repeatedly told me I was doing fine, but I just had our first performance review, and I’m being offered 2 things:\n\n**PIP vs Severance.**\n\nThis severance side offer is brand new this year and our company has had huge layoffs.\n\nThe actual meeting was another vague collection of criticisms, in which, when I asked him what I could’ve ideally done differently, he said “I’m not here to give specific edge cases for you to iterate literally off of and am just looking for high level resourcefulness from you”.\n\nWhen he would list specifically delayed features, I would tell him how I did everything in my power, including implementing his advice (which I can prove), only for the infra related reasons to delay it.\n\nWhen I tried to show areas I’ve improved in, he would agree but then re-insist how below the mark I am even though I’m never been sure what a “Meets Expectation” counterpart of me hypothetically looks like all year. His goalpost for me always felt fictional.\n\nNow, I feel extremely jaded and demotivated being forced into this job market. I’ve been leetcoding here and there before this review to hedge myself, but I’m struggling to hold onto any confidence in my abilities.\n\nMaybe I’ll never find an opportunity as good as this one ever again, and I can’t cope with that. I’m going through the motions, contacting some industry friends, and doing those silly LC problems, but I feel hopeless.",

        "content": "Yes, there are a few downsides. The market is also pretty shitty. BUT.. other fields have it so much worse than us.\n\nWhy SWE is the best:\n\n* Even if your goal is to just be an average SWE, you will still end up making 2x or 3x what most other fields make.\n* The ability to work from home or have a flexible hybrid schedule is AMAZING. There are so many jobs where you have to show up to work at a very specific time and if you're even 1 minute late, you get reprimanded for it. How cool is it that we can show up to work at 11am and leave whenever we want? How cool is it to tell you manager \"Hey I'll be away this afternoon\" and they are totally fine with it? Not many fields have this luxury.\n* The work is genuinely interesting. Software runs the world. It's awesome to be able to understand how these big systems work and be able to contribute to them. Through real world work + a Computer Science degree, the 'magic' behind computers vanishes and you really start to acknowledge the beauty behind all the abstractions. It's just such a cool field in general.\n* There is so much variety in what companies you can work for. Want an extremely prestigious and high paying job? You know what to study to make that happen. Want a chill job? You know where to apply for those. Want to join an exciting start-up and work on something from the ground up while wearing multiple hats? Yeah, there are tons of those jobs too. The possibilities are endless.\n* Similar to the above, there is tons of variety in what you can do in your career. Since SWE is so intertwined with every other field, the possibilities are near endless. Want to make web-apps for millions of people? DO IT!! Want to work on medical devices to save people's lives? YES QUEEN. How about writing code for satellites that power GPS systems across the world? LETS GO!!! Oh, you want to write code for simulation software so scientists can research the effects of earthquakes? AYYYY BRUH!! Literally the possibilities are endless.\n* It's an office job. I don't have to be out in the extreme heat or extreme cold breaking my body. People who work in manual labour jobs are completely screwed by the time they hit their mid 30s. Aching backs, wrists, shoulders, neck, you name it. Their body is broken when they get into their prime years. The work is also brutal. Imagine lifting heavy things for 12 hours a day in extreme weather, just to make $50k a year? Meanwhile I'm in the office (or at home in my pajamas) drinking some coffee and working on a cool puzzle.. and getting paid tons of money to do it.\n* The ability to impact millions of people with your code. Not many fields have access to such a large scale as we do. If you work for a well-known company, then it's likely that the features you build and the code that you push will affect the lives of literally millions of people across the world. It's cool to know that your work is recognized on such a global scale.\n\nSo yeah. I know times are tough right now. There are some downsides of course too. But overall, I think SWE is still the best field.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Feel free to add your own points as I'm sure I missed a ton of things.",

        "content": "I'm losing my mind with this job market. 6 months of searching and I'm getting absolutely nowhere.\n\nMy background: 1 year as sysadmin (Linux, Windows Server, monitoring, automation), 2 years teaching cybersecurity at university level, currently freelancing doing ISMS implementations and ISO 27001 consulting. Master's in Cybersecurity. I can script, I know my way around networks, I've deployed everything from ELK stacks to Kubernetes clusters.\n\nBut apparently none of that matters because:\n\n**\"We need someone with 5+ years experience\"** \\- Dude, I have 4+ years in IT, just not all in the same role. Why does teaching cybersecurity to students not count as experience? Why does implementing security frameworks for actual paying clients not count?\n\n**\"You don't have experience with Palo Alto/Fortinet/SonicWall\"** \\- IT'S A FUCKING FIREWALL. Yes, each vendor has their own special snowflake syntax and GUI, but the concepts are the same. Port 443 is port 443 whether it's pfSense or a $50k Palo Alto. Give me a week with the documentation and I'll be configuring rules like I've been doing it for years.\n\n**\"We need someone who knows our exact stack\"** \\- Cool, so you want a unicorn who has experience with your specific combination of ancient VMware, that one obscure monitoring tool you bought in 2015, and whatever cloud mess you've accumulated over the years.\n\nThe worst part? Half these jobs get reposted every month because *surprise* \\- that perfect candidate doesn't exist or doesn't want to work for your lowball salary.\n\n**And another thing** \\- why the fuck don't internships count as \"real experience\"? I spent 3 years doing actual work during internships. Not fetching coffee or making copies - I was troubleshooting servers, implementing security policies, managing infrastructure. But apparently that's \"just internship experience\" and doesn't count toward their magical 5-year requirement.\n\nMeanwhile, every goddamn article and report keeps screaming about the **\"cybersecurity skills shortage\"** and **\"millions of unfilled IT positions.\"** You know what would solve that? HIRING THE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE EAGER TO LEARN AND PROVE THEMSELVES.\n\nInstead, companies want to poach already-established professionals from other companies, creating this stupid musical chairs game where everyone just shuffles around for higher salaries while entry-level candidates get locked out entirely. Then they act shocked when there's a \"talent shortage.\"\n\nI've had interviews where I walk them through actual projects I've completed, demonstrate my problem-solving skills, show them my homelab setup, and then get rejected because I haven't used their specific brand of the same damn technology I've been working with for years.\n\nAnd don't get me started on cybersecurity roles. \"Entry level position, 5 years experience required.\" The math doesn't fucking math. How am I supposed to get experience if no one will hire me to get experience?\n\nI know some of you have been in similar situations. How did you break through this stupid cycle? I'm starting to think I should just lie on my resume about having used every vendor's gear and hope they don't quiz me on CLI commands during the interview.\n\n/rant\n\n**TL;DR:** Job market is stupid, vendors need to stop making the same technology with different commands, and HR departments need to learn the difference between \"nice to have\" and \"absolutely required.\"",

Hear me out. What prompted me thinking about this:\n\nOur Sr Director just announced she was leaving after 1 year with the company, and another Sr Manager adjacent to mine left recently with 1 year at the company. I checked both their LinkedIn profiles - the director has worked at 10 companies in 15 years, and the manager 12 companies in 20 years. \n\nWhat kind of stability is that? These are folks who have a lot of employees reporting to them, and we rely on them for direction and culture building. Also, why are companies continually OK hiring people like this? That's what I *really* don't get. You think you're the special company where this new hire is going to stick around, after over a decade of ~1-1.5 year tenures? It just seems like an incredible waste of resources.\n\nEverywhere I look on LinkedIn, it's the same. 1-2 year tenures at every company. Hell, that's barely enough time to really learn the ropes and build some impact projects. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of these people really don't know what they're doing and their actual job is just \"job hopper.\"\n\nThoughts?",

One person doing the work of two or three, same deadlines, same expectations the entire team had... **\"We are a lean company\"** \n\n\n**BUT WHY IS THERE SO MUCH MANAGEMENT?** Above me in my org I had my manager, senior manager, director, senior director, VP number one, VP number two, SVP.... And this was supposedly a very lean organization, right? Totally lean, definitely no bloat there! /s there was a partner team that did almost the exact same thing as us for a different business unit and mirrored nearly the same management structure. VP down to analysts, and we often took on a lot of the stuff that they were supposed to take but they didn't have enough workers...\n\n\nAnd the weirdest part is that even though we have shifted hundreds of thousands of jobs over to India in their glorified BS office, we still continue to cut more jobs but none of them are management.

People or articles  keep saying, “It’s because of AI,” but I find that hard to believe. Personally, I don’t think that’s true.\n\nYes, AI is here, and lots of engineers use it, but most of us treat it like a tool something to help with debugging, writing tedious tests, or generating basic code templates. It definitely boosts efficiency, but at least from my experience, it’s nowhere near replacing engineers.\n\nI think companies are laying people off because the tech industry is struggling in general. There are lots of contributing factors, like economic shifts or the new government administration, and I feel like people are overreacting by blaming it all on AI. Did Microsoft really lay off 6,000 employees just because of AI progress? I really don’t think so. I’m kinda tired of people overusing the word “AI”\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\n",

For my fourth internship, I worked on core changes that were actually used at scale (millions only, not billions like Meta).\n\nMy point is that I think it’s clear that I am willing to put in long hours, I’m able to BS impact, I’ve worked at scale, and I’ve been previously a high-performer elsewhere.

        "content": "Hello everyone, I graduated in May of 2024 with a BSCS. I failed to secure an internship in either the summer after sophomore or junior year. Just before graduating, I had applied to about 35 jobs with no response - not even an asynchronous coding test. It was already clear that I was cooked with no internships. Combining this disappointment with some major health issues, I went the next 7 months after graduation without applying to a single job. I started applying again in January 2025 and over the last 5 months, I've applied to 142 jobs through Linkedin, Indeed and rarely some other sites.\n\nIn all of these jobs, only about 15 were for software engineering, with all of the rest being lesser tech roles, some even barely tech related: Data Analyst I, Junior Business Analyst, Entry Level QA tester, etc. I've received a total of 6 \"next steps\" including 3 in person interviews and 0 offers. During this time, the only experience I've been able to advertise is my senior year Software Engineering project (year long capstone), an online Business Analysis course, and a handful of menial summer jobs. Grinding Leetcode is pointless - like I said, I've never even been granted the opportunity of a coding interview. Leveraging what few family connections I have has led to little more than \"apply online\" or \"send me your resume\" (the one with no real experience on it).\n\nI hear all of these stories that say \"Don't give up! I applied to 500 jobs before I landed my first software engineering job\". Nevermind that there's no chance of me landing an SE job as my first role (no internships), I have yet to get a straight answer as to where people are even seeing 500 relevant tech roles LET ALONE entry level. Both Indeed and Linkedin have slowed to a drip of one semi-relevant entry level job for every 15 that are irrelevant, a scam, or 2-4 years experience crap.\n\nSo that's where I am. I have no idea what to do at this point, short of applying to Revature and seeing where that takes me (literally). Every day that goes by, I can feel the entry level CS jobs dwindling. God forbid yet another class graduates before I land a job. If anyone has succeeded after a similar situation, please let me know.\n\nThe current iteration of my resume.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/HMpuu7m?s=sms\nI’ve made some minor PII redactions for the post and I’ve also recently removed the few summer jobs from “Experience” as it didn’t seem to be doing me any favors.

        "author": "LeadBamboozler",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Sharing this as a heads-up for anyone considering interviewing with CoreWeave, especially for security or infrastructure roles. I went through two interview loops with them, several months apart, and was ghosted once and required multiple follow-ups to not be ghosted a second time — despite confirmed positive feedback from interviewers.\n\n**Round 1 (~7 months ago)**\n\nI interviewed for a Tech Lead role with a near perfect match in domain, stack, ownership, and experience level. Went through five rounds:\n\n- Recruiter\n- Director\n- Tech Lead (coding round)\n- Principal Engineer (system design)\n- Security Analyst (cross-functional)\nI moved through the interview cycle and after the cross-functional round, the recruiter emailed me thanking me for taking the time to interview and said he’d collate the feedback and be in touch when he had an update. Ghosted after this email despite repeated follow-ups. I connected with the Director on LinkedIn a month or so after this.\n\n**Round 2 (3 weeks ago)**\n\nThe director shared a Staff Engineer posting that looked to be a direct replacement for the Tech Lead role, so I reached out to him on LinkedIn. He apologized for the earlier ghosting, said I got strong feedback, and that the org had new leadership and shifted direction — fewer managers, more senior ICs. He said he’d love to re-engage and that the recruiter would reach out.\n\nThe recruiter (same one who ghosted me originally) called me a few days later — but instead of the Staff role, he described an Infrastructure Security role that had similar domain requirements. Maybe I should’ve clarified right then, but I assumed it was all part of the same track and the recruiter mentioned that I would be assessed on the same principles that I was assessed on in the previous interview loop - he explicitly said that he had no concerns at all.\n\nThey scheduled me with a new distinguished engineer who had joined since the original ghosting. We did not cover a single topic that was discussed in the previous interview.\n\nWhile the discussion was somewhat related to my area, there was a focus on some fairly obscure but oddly specific topics. Despite the curveball - I think I reasoned correctly about the nuances while acknowledging that this area was not something I had direct experience in. The discussion was still highly collaborative and flowed naturally and at the end, the DE mentioned he hoped to speak with me again soon.\n\nThen: more silence. Followed up with the recruiter. Nothing. Followed up with the Director on LinkedIn. He said, “let me talk to the recruiter.” A few days later I got a templated rejection email. Zero feedback with an explicit note in the template saying they can’t provide feedback.\n\nI understand that goals evolve quickly at high-growth companies. But from a candidate’s perspective, this felt like goalposts were shifting between cycles, and maybe even between rounds. There is a total misalignment in what they’re looking for and across what experience levels. Interestingly - one of the questions I asked DE was *what was the hardest problem he was trying to solve at CoreWeave?*\n\nHis answer? Hiring and building the team.\n\nSo if you're thinking of interviewing with CoreWeave: proceed with your eyes open. This process burned a lot of my time, and I walked away with zero signal on where I was off target.",

I’ve got a security clearance and I’m fully remote, though technically I had to move to a city with an office. That said, I haven’t gone in to the office since late 2023. Think San Antonio / Orlando / Phoenix type of MCOL city.\n\nThe job’s honestly pretty great, super chill WLB (almost never over 40 hours), everyone’s really friendly, and the tech stack is solid (React, Spring Boot, Django) since the project only started in 2020. It’s laid-back enough that I’ve had the freedom to work on finishing my OMSCS degree from Georgia Tech.\n\nNow I just got an offer for a new job in Seattle, around $140k, hybrid (2 days in-office) for now but I’ve heard they might go full RTO soon. I used one of those simple cost of living calculators online and it says my current $80k here is equivalent to about $110k in Seattle... So I'm wondering… is being fully remote  worth the $30k difference?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. And just for context—I’m 32M, married (no kids), and had a totally different career for most of my 20s before I got my 2nd degree in CS and switched to tech. My wife (30F) makes around $80k and works in a field where she can find a new job within a week in pretty much any major city, so we’re not worried about her on that front.",

        "content": "\nMy Background: New Grad SWE (graduated 2025), 1.5 years freelancing, currently 6 months into industry SWE role. \n\nHey everyone, I am looking for advice in my current role. I landed my first software engineering job about 6 months ago after applying to over 750 jobs. The process broke me a bit, but I was so relieved to finally get a foot in the door. This was the only company I made to the final round, so I was going to take it since I was graduating in the next couple months and needed to secure work. It’s a small startup with a team of about 10 engineers. But the environment and expectations are burning me out and I don’t know what to do. \n\nHere’s what’s been making this so hard:\n- Strict micromanagement: My boss tracks and questions every small task. Sometimes asking for 5-6 different changes on the same ticket. When I think something is done, I have to go back and add even more to it, despite it never being asked in the first place. \n\n- Zero mentorship or support: I was thrown into the codebase with minimal onboarding and barely any documentation. No code reviews, no senior dev guidance — I’m expected to figure out complex features solo and somehow get everything right. Ive been able to figure things out, but it’s been a very tedious and tiresome process. \n\n- Unrealistic expectations: Every ticket is somehow “urgent,” and I always feel behind because the timelines just aren’t realistic. There’s no prioritization since EVERYTHING seems to be high priority. Every month management says they will “replan the month priorities” but they never do and I’m stuck with infinite tickets for the month that just all need to be done. \n\n- Long commute:  have a 3 hour daily commute (1.5 hours each way). I am yet to ask for remote work, but my peer told me not to expect more than 1 day remote, despite the majority of the team having 2-3 days a week remote. By the time I get home, Im exhausted and barely have time to decompress or do things I like before having to sleep to get my 8 hours. \n\nUltimately, I feel trapped. I was grateful to find work after sending 700+ apps, but this constant grind in this environment is really disrupting my mental health. I don’t want to go back to square one and leave this job since I have a lot of financial pressures, but can’t see my self staying here much longer. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips or advice on how to manage this? I feel like 1yoe does not mean anything in this market, but Im not sure how much longer I can continue doing this. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!\n\nTLDR: 6 months into first SWE role, feeling stressed from work environment, expectations,  and commute. What should I do?\n",

        "content": "I graduated from a CS bootcamp in May 2023. Previously I had only worked in retail. I do not have a Bachelor's or even an AA degree (though a decent amount of community college units completed). Right out of the bootcamp I was lucky enough to land an internship at a small government organization via a connection through the bootcamp.\n\nI was then converted to full time after the internship. It was a pretty modest junior web developer role that only paid about $50k/yr but the work environment and mentorship were phenomenal. And at least it had some pension and healthcare benefits. Over the last 22 months I've learned a ton and have been given the freedom to make some large and meaningful contributions to the company's flagship products.\n\nSadly we've been hit with some pretty heft budget cutbacks. As the most junior person at the company I'm first on the chopping block and was laid off. As I was being let go, the organization's director offered me a Teaching Assist position at the bootcamp I had graduated. Apparently part of their deal with the bootcamp requires they contribute a certain amount of developer hours towards instruction.\n\nShe wanted to try something new with a single dev doing the Teaching Assistant thing full time (previously they'd have the more senior devs rotate in every now and then). Currently I work 3 days from home and 2 days in-office. The teaching role would be 4 days a week on-site. I would still be employed by my current organization and keep the title of \"Junior Web Developer\". My compensation would be cut down to $30k/yr AND no benefits.\n\nI have a few days to think it over but am tempted to pass on the \"opportunity\". Would that be a mistake? It would be nice to add a third year as a junior developer to my resume along with some teaching experience but I feel like they're really just taking advantage of me.\n\nAlternatively I can try to test the waters in this absolutely awful job market. But don't foresee myself getting anywhere. I know tons of people with CS degrees that are having no luck whatsoever. I could also alternatively collect unemployment while working towards an accelerated degree program myself and hope things get better in a year or two.\n\nI feel stuck between two kinda terrible options. Any advice is very much appreciated. Thanks!\n\ntl;dr Bootcamp grad with no degree but 2 yoe. Currently making $50k/yr with healthcare benefits. Was laid off but offered $30k/yr and no healthcare. Should I take the ~$1900/mo net pay offer just to pad my resume while looking for other jobs? Alternatively I could collect unemployment at $1800/months for 6 months while applying full time and working towards a CS degree\n\nEdit: I spoke to my principal engineer and he was pretty adamant that I do not take that position. He said he couldn’t promise anything but if there was ever an opening for a developer I would be the first person he calls. If I took the teaching job he would be pretty powerless to bring me back on",

I also worry that since I already lack a strong work history, spending another 4\\~5 years in school will make for a worse situation with regard to that.\n\nI don't have any lofty career aspirations, but obviously I would still like to find a job after (or during) school. The other degree I'm most interested in is visual art, which I think has even worse career prospects lol.\n\nBasically looking for some guidance on whether it's reasonable to go for CS factoring in my age, sparse resume, the job market, etc. And is the outlook so bad that I should just say F it and go for an art degree instead?? half kidding haha",

However, my advisor wasn't able to approve it this May, which is when I expected to graduate. For lack of a better word, my advisor isn't very good. She's super nice and knowledgeable but has been very off-the-grid for the whole year, which meant getting her to even respond to short emails was incredibly frustrating. In fact, she hasn't even been in the country (United States, she's in Austria) this whole year. Even though my thesis is basically finished, she hasn't even gotten around to fully reading my current final draft yet.\n\nAs per my university policy, it doesn't seem like I can get my degree conferred until *next semester.*\n\nI finished all my classes and every other M.S. degree requirement.\n\nWhat should I do?

        "content": "When I graduated in 2023, I applied for a backend Java role. My resume was about SpringBoot projects. One of the companies I contacted asked about JVM, databases, and made me do LeetCode problems. I got the offer later and accepted it considering the fair salary. But I thought my role was to do Java backend development.\n\nHowever, when I got into the company, I found out that they were using GWT (Google Web Toolkit) to build both frontend and backend, and I was assigned to GWT front end to develop web applications and desktop applications.\n\nFor your reference, GWT means developing frontend and backend using Java alone. The frontend is trans-compiled into JS code by the GWT compiler from Java code. Google used it to build Google Docs.\n\nThe technology-GWT is already abandoned by Google, and nobody is using that anymore. I felt very pressured about my current situation but was afraid to jump to other positions because I thought I would not competitive, and jumping too fast would be a stain on my resume as a new graduate. And I also hesitated about the thought of going for a master's degree.\n\nAnd this is a vicious downward spiral. The more I delay finding a real Java backend position, the less valuable I become on the job market.\n\nHaving stayed at the role for two years, now I did realize my situation, and I think the correct solution is try to jump to other companies as soon as possible. And I think the master's degree solution has more disadvantages in terms of accumulation of savings, so I abandoned it.\n\nStill, I feel very anxious about starting finding jobs, because apparently working experience is the most valuable thing on the job market. If I apply for a front-end job (that is what I'm doing with GWT), nobody wants a Java programmer because the market needs React.js and JavaScript programmer. If I apply for a back-end job, my working experience is useless too because I didn't do SpringBoot.\n\nI think I am really in a very disadvantageous situation now. I wonder how you view my situation, and I would appreciate it if you have suggestions for me.",

I also got somewhat disillusioned at the realization that projects never truly end - I love learning as much as the next guy, but all the endless studying that ends up becoming obsolete too quickly... got to me somewhat. It's weird given why I wanted to become a dev in the first place, but it feels like, in a sense, I developed a depression in futility. It's like none of things I did would matter in the next few months. I would've been fine with it. But it's too quickly in my opinion...\n\nMy second job was in a corporate bank as an SRE junior officer. I like how organized it is. How much less pressure there is on me. I can safely take a Leave when necessary without the threat of on-call. Odd because this job IS an on-call. High salary. Great benefits. I also thought trying a different job might grant me new perspective. Switching from development to operations. It's not a total career switching, but it's different enough.\n\nI was optimistic... and got punished for it. After I got regularized, my workload gradually increased. I can normally handle it but the issue is the way things happened.\n\nI currently live in a solo apartment, on-call hybrid setup (just this month, I had to work outside my hours many times, some on weekends). There's so much to learn, so much to do, so much juggle... I *can't*. I can't keep up. I realized a fundamental fact about myself - I'm not a great multitasker. I'm a deep thinker (which is why I aspired to be a dev in the first place). I can multi-task, but not so often and not so fast-paced. It's not sustainable. And now, I'm falling apart.\n\nMy routine was ruined. I don't eat as much. I have inconsistent sleep hours (too few or too much sleep). I don't even leave my apartment in the weekends because I'm too tired and I have housework to do. The salary is great but I doubt it's worth how disorganized I've become. I've become obsessed with completing my tasks. I don't respond to my parents' calls and messages anymore. It hasn't even been a year and I'm already crushed under pressure.\n\nThings became so bad my work performance plummeted - lapses in judgement, slower memory, increasingly \"closed-off\" behavior, breathing problems, headaches, constant exhaustion... I pretty much decided to screw it and go home this weekend. I want to see my family and de-stress. But I know fully well that won't be enough.\n\nI don't know what to do. I want to job hop but even THAT is an effort in itself in my current situation. I'm too tired for it. I took Leave once a month, but it's not enough.\n\nI made enough savings and my family is not financially struggling. My sister already has a job and graduating in a month or two. I feel guilty for the idea nonetheless because I'll become a burden and is using them to cushion me, but I'm so lost.\n\nI also don't know where I want to go, what I want to do. Do I leave IT profession entirely? Or is it a case of having terrible work-life balance and hope the next one would be the golden goose? I'm being pessimistic right now and believe that's just perpetuating the cycle.\n\nI'm at a point where I'd probably be happy with a lower paying job with less stress and pressure on studying off-hours like my experiences forced on me.",

It's helpful for writing simple tests or creating simple utilities and classes but the moment things get really complex it just end up in loops and it never achieves what I want. Most of the time it gets to the point where I need to split up the task into super tiny granular prompts and at that point it's just faster for me to do the job myself.\n\nAre there people here who work in big codebases that find it helpful aside from writing simple tests and utilities? What I mean is building full fledged features by vibe coding. My company is really pushing us to build features purely by writing prompts and even though I want it to work it's just unproductive if I have to write extremely granular prompts.",

I want to get into development, and while this job offers that, will I get stuck here? My friends are telling me that I am ‘cooked’ but in my mind, even with these old languages, there is still so much practical experience here that can transfer into better development jobs that is much better than just sitting on my ass and getting decline letters for lack of experience.

Are there any ways I can improve my chances of getting a team match or speed up the process? How likely is it to get matched within this window?\n\nAdditionally, I have a few questions:\n\n1. I initially gave a salary expectation in the 50th–75th percentile for L4 (based on levels.fyi). Would it help to tell the recruiter I’m open to less, as I care more about the opportunity to grow at AWS than compensation?\n2. I’ve seen suggestions to regularly follow up with the recruiter. Is weekly follow-up too frequent? Should I reach out by phone or email? Should I inform them if I see newly opened roles that interest me?\n3. Is there any way to get in touch with hiring managers directly to advocate for myself?\n\nAny insights or suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

Given that I was relatively new, and our FTE count was down due to this departure, I agreed to help complete their outstanding projects with the expectation of taking time in July (I know, I know…this was a bad idea. Had I known the complexity of this project, if it was further pushed by management, I would have refused or resigned).\n\nBaby came at the start of Q2, and the project has experienced setbacks — I learned after the fact that the knowledge transfer wasn’t all that complete, and the block of code i recieved in transition will probably require major rework thru validation. I can easily see this going thru Q2 and into the beginning of Q3.\n\nIssue is I’m not sleeping due to the baby schedule, and I have a chronic condition I am managing privately. It’s not an issue usually, but currently I am feeling exhausted and starting to experience burnout. My partner is also starting to wear thin, and is requesting my presence with the newborn and our other children. We are entitled to a large amount of paternity leave at my company, but I feel this would almost be considered abandoning my project. I’m currently stuck between not wanting to fail work/losing employment and being there for my family.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thanks again.\n\n",

My undergrad GPA isn't helping me either. Are CS Masters like MBA programs where if you're not going to an elite program you might as well not even go? Also, I'm trying to double down on AI/ML/Robotics and I've noticed that some of the easier to get into masters programs don't even offer much in the way of AI classes, forget being able to do research? Any ideas or opinions or insults welcome.",

This leaves an \\~8 month gap where I'd like to get some industry experience (and make some money before grad school), so I'll also be applying for jobs.\n\nHere's the problem I'm having:\n\n* I would love to do some internship/co-op during this time, but most internship postings look for students who will have a semester of school left after the internship, and given that PhD decision don't come out until the Spring (and the recent unpredictability of admissions), I cannot guarantee this at all. Given that my resume lists December 2025 as my graduation date, I fear that applying to internships will get me auto-rejected.\n* If I were to apply for new grad instead, then if I do get accepted into a PhD program, I'll have to quit the job after less than a year, which I don't think is a good look. On the bright side, if I don't get accepted into any PhD programs, then I'm all set up with a nice job.\n\nI would prefer the internship/co-op route, so I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to apply to internships between undergrad and grad school when you're not even sure if you'll be accepted into grad school, and your resume shows that you're about to finish your degree.\n\nThanks!",

I have interest in web dev too.\n\nI have the issue of deciding on how I should go about it in terms of Leetcodeing or projects.  I have a few projects under my belt, but nothing crazy but no leetcode experience and Ill admit, outside of arrays and linked list, my data structures are rusty.    \n  \nWith that said, is grinding leetcode worth it still?  Im still gonna go through the process of brushing up on data structures, but tbh I dont really care about working in a faang, I just want a job.    \n  \nIm trying really hard to code more, but ive been so depressed about the last few years due to life events that I cant even really get out of bed anymore, so Im trying really hard to get myself motivated.",
