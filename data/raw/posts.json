        "content": "We are hiring for a data engineering position, and I am responsible for the technical portion of the screening process. \n\nIt‚Äôs pretty basic verbal stuff, explain the different sql joins, explain CTEs, explain Python function vs generator, followed by some very easy functional programming in python and some spark. \n\nAnyway ‚Äî back to my story. \n\nI hop onto the meeting and introduce myself and ask some warm up questions about their background, etc. Immediately I notice this person‚Äôs head moves a LOT when they talk. And it moves in this‚Ä¶ odd kind of way‚Ä¶ and it does the same kind of movement over and over again. Odd, but I keep going. At one point this‚Ä¶  agent‚Ä¶. Talks for about 2 min straight without taking a single breath or even sounding short of breath, which was incredibly jarring. \n\nThen we get into the actual technical exercise. I ask them to find a small bug in some python code that is just making a very simple API call. It‚Äôs a small syntax error, very basic, easy to miss but running the script and reading the error message spells it out for you. This agent starts explaining that the defect is due to a failure to authenticate with this api endpoint, which is not true at all. But the agent starts going into GREAT detail on how rest authentication works using oAuth tokens (which it wasn‚Äôt even using), and how that is the issue. Without even trying to run it. \n\nSo I ask ‚Äúinteresting can you walk me through the code and explain how you identified that as the issue?‚Äù And it just repeats everything it just said a minute ago. I ask it again to try and explain the code to me and to fix the code. It starts saying the same thing a third time, then it drops entirely from the call. \n\n\nSo I spent about 30 minutes today talking to someone‚Äôs scammer AI agent who somehow got their way past the basic HR screening. \n\nThis is the world we are living in. \n\nThis is not an advertisement for a position, please don‚Äôt ask me about the position, the intent of this post is just to share this experience with other professionals and raise some awareness to be careful with these interviews. If you contact me about this position, I promise I will just delete the message. Sorry. \n\n\nI very much wish I could have interviewed a real person instead of wasting 30 minutes of my time üòî \n",

We‚Äôre working on a joint project.\n\nMost of the other interns rely almost entirely on ChatGPT and other AI tools for their work full scripts, SQL, everything. When their code breaks (which happens a lot), they either throw it back into ChatGPT or come to me to fix it.\n\nI‚Äôve been writing my own code so I actually learn what I‚Äôm doing ,because enjoy coding, and want to build real skills. I do use AI here and there, but only as a tool not to generate entire solutions blindly. When I showed them some of my handwritten code, they were shocked I didn‚Äôt just have ChatGPT generate it.\n\nIt‚Äôs gotten worse too, I was writing a data cleaning script they needed, and they got visibly frustrated because I wasn‚Äôt just dumping it into ChatGPT to ‚Äúmake it faster‚Äù so they could have the cleaned data immediately.\n\nAnd the worst part? When something breaks in their code later they blame me, saying the data wasn‚Äôt properly cleaned or transformed. But when I actually look at their code, it‚Äôs often errors they introduced because they didn‚Äôt really understand what they were pasting in from ChatGPT. I then have to point out the bugs they don‚Äôt even realize are there because they didn‚Äôt write the code themselves.\n\nI also didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù education, I went go to school online and it‚Äôs a shock to see how people from brick and mortar schools operate sense I haven‚Äôt work with peers my age up until now. Which is making me second guess whether I‚Äôve chosen the right path or not. \n\nMy question is: am I taking the right approach by focusing on writing my own code and building skills, or should I be using AI more heavily like the others?\n\nIf you have read all of this I appreciate you taking the time, any advice would be greatly appreciated!

The field is heavily geared towards business objectives, with the primary goal being to enhance stakeholder profitibility. This is amplified by how much investment is funelled to the cloud monopolies.\n\nI'd to like my job to have a positive societal impact.

That way, organisations that you'd want to work for, will want you to work for them. But, it would be better if i could focus my efforts.

We just recently started using GIT for our SQL development and while the team is technically adapting to it, they're not really embracing it. There's a strong resistance to anything that might be seen as \"overhead\" like data orchestration,  basic testing, good modelling, single definitions for business logic, etc. Things like QA or proper reviews are not treated with much importance because the priority is speed, even though it's very obvious that our output as a team is often chaotic (and we end up in many \"emergency data request\" situations).\n\nThe problem is that the work we produce is often rushed and full of issues. We frequently ship dashboards or models that contain errors and don't scale. There's no real documentation or data lineage. And when things break, the fixes are usually quick patches rather than root cause fixes.\n\nIt's been wearing on me a little. I care a lot about doing things properly. I want to build things that are scalable, maintainable, and accurate. But I feel like I'm constantly fighting an uphill battle and I'm starting to burn out from caring too much when no one else seems to.\n\nIf you've ever been in a situation like this, how did you handle it? How do you keep your mental health intact when you're the only one pushing for quality? Did you stay and try to change things over time or did you eventually leave?\n\nAny advice, even small things, would help.\n\nPS: I'm not a manager - just a humble analyst üòÖ\n\n",

Torn between safety and opportunity.\n\nBackground:\nI‚Äôm 28 and have spent the last 7 years working primarily as a Cloud Data Engineer (most recently in a Lead role), with some Solutions Engineering work on the side. I got laid off last week and, while still processing that, two new paths have opened up. One‚Äôs predictable. The other‚Äôs risky but potentially career-changing.\n\nOption 1: Potential CTO role at a trading startup\n\n‚Ä¢ Small early-stage team (2‚Äì3 engineers) building a medium-frequency trading platform for the Indian market (mainly F&O)\n\n‚Ä¢ A close friend is involved and referred me to manage the technical side, they see me as a strong CTO candidate if things go well\n\n‚Ä¢ Solid funding in place; runway isn‚Äôt a concern right now\n\n‚Ä¢ Stack is MERN, which I‚Äôve never worked with! I‚Äôd need to learn it from the ground up\n\n‚Ä¢ They‚Äôre willing to fully support my ramp-up\n\n‚Ä¢ 2‚Äì3 year commitment expected\n\n‚Ä¢ Compensation is roughly equal to what I was earning before\n\nOption 2: Data Engineering role with a previous client\n\n‚Ä¢ Work involves building a data platform on GCP\n\n‚Ä¢ Very much in my comfort zone; I‚Äôve done this kind of work for years\n\n‚Ä¢ Slight pay bump\n\n‚Ä¢ Feels safe, but also a bit stagnant‚Äîlow learning, low risk\n\nWhat‚Äôs tearing me up:\n\n‚Ä¢ The CTO role would push me outside my comfort zone and force me to become a more well-rounded engineer and leader\n\n‚Ä¢ My Solutions Engineering background makes me confident I can bridge tech and business, which the CTO role demands\n\n‚Ä¢ But stepping away from 7 years of focused data engineering experience‚Äîam I killing my momentum?\n\n‚Ä¢ What if the startup fails? Will a 2‚Äì3 year detour make it harder to re-enter the data space?\n\n‚Ä¢ The safe choice is obvious‚Äîbut the risk could also pay off big, in terms of growth and leadership experience\n\nPersonal context:\n\n‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt have major financial obligations right now‚Äîso if I ever wanted to take a risk, now‚Äôs probably the time\n\n‚Ä¢ My friend vouched for me hard and believes I can do this. If I accept, I‚Äôd want to commit fully for at least a couple of years\n\nQuestions for you all:\n\n‚Ä¢ Has anyone made a similar pivot from a focused engineering specialty (like data) to a full-stack or leadership role?\n\n‚Ä¢ If so, how did it impact your career long-term? Any regrets?\n\n‚Ä¢ Did you find it hard to return to your original path, or was the leadership experience a net positive?\n\n‚Ä¢ Or am I overthinking this entirely?\n\n\nThanks for reading this long post‚Äîhonestly just needed to write it out. Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who's been through something like this.\n",

So I built something myself ‚Äî a **distributed review analysis pipeline** using Dask, PyTorch, and transformer-based NLP models.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n* **Data:** 17M+ Steam reviews (\\~40GB uncompressed), scraped using the Steam API\n* **Hardware:** Ryzen 9 7900X, 32GB RAM, RTX 4080 Super (16GB VRAM)\n* **Goal:** Process massive review datasets quickly and summarize key insights (sentiment + summarization)\n\n**Engineering Challenges (and Lessons):**\n\n1. **Transformer Parallelism Pain:** Initially, each Dask worker loaded its own model ‚Äî ballooned memory use 6x. Fixed it by loading the model once and passing handles to workers. GPU usage dropped drastically.\n2. **CUDA + Serialization Hell:** Trying to serialize CUDA tensors between workers triggered crashes. Eventually settled on keeping all GPU operations in-place with smart data partitioning + local inference.\n3. **Auto-Hardware Adaptation:** The system detects hardware and:\n   * Spawns optimal number of workers\n   * Adjusts batch sizes based on RAM/VRAM\n   * Falls back to CPU with smaller batches (16 samples) if no GPU\n4. **From 30min to 2min:** For 200K reviews, the pipeline used to take over 30 minutes ‚Äî now it's down to \\~2 minutes. 15x speedup.\n\n**Dask Architecture Highlights:**\n\n* Dynamic worker spawning\n* Shared model access\n* Fault-tolerant processing\n* Smart batching and cleanup between tasks\n\n**What I‚Äôd Love Advice On:**\n\n* Is this architecture sound from a data engineering perspective?\n* Should I focus on scaling up to **multi-node** (Kubernetes, Ray, etc.) or polishing what I have?\n* Any strategies for **multi-GPU optimization** and memory handling?\n* Worth refactoring for **stream-based (real-time) review ingestion**?\n* Are there common pitfalls I‚Äôm not seeing?\n\n**Potential Applications Beyond Gaming:**\n\n* App Store reviews\n* Amazon product sentiment\n* Customer feedback for SaaS tools\n\nüîó **GitHub repo**: [https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens](https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens)\n\nI've uploaded the data I scrapped on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshgharat/steam-games-data-40-gb) if anyone want to use it\n\n  \nHappy to take any suggestions ‚Äî would love to hear thoughts from folks who've built distributed ML or analytics systems at scale!\n\nThanks in advance üôè",

However, I work for a company that develops tools for data scientists and that somewhat requires me to dive deeper into this field.\n\nI'm slowly getting into it, but what I kinda struggle with is understanding DE tools landscape. There are so much of them and it's hard for me (without practical expreience in the field) to determine which are actually used, which are just hype and not really used in production anywhere, and which technologies might be not widely discussed anymore, but still used in a lot of (perhaps legacy) setups.\n\nTo figure this out, I decided the best solution is to ask people who actually work with data lol. So would you mind sharing in the comments what technologies you use in your job? Would be super helpful if you also include a bit of information about what you use these tools for.",

Anyone using a similar **hybrid on-prem ‚Üí AWS** setup:\n   * What worked or didn‚Äôt work?\n2. Thoughts on using Aurora PostgreSQL as a landing zone vs  S3?\n3.

I don‚Äôt have any prior background on data engineering but on our 3 man team I‚Äôm the one with the most experience in Python. \n\nWe had been using Prefect which was going well before they moved to a paid model to use our own compute. Previously I had about 25 scripts that would launch at different times to my worker on our company server using prefect. It sadly has to be on my local instance of our server since they rely on something called Alteryx which our two data analysts use basically exclusively. \n\nI liked prefects UI but not the 100$ a month price tag. I don‚Äôt really have the bandwidth or good-will credits with our IT to advocate for the self-hosted version. I‚Äôve been thinking of ways to mimic what we had before but I‚Äôm at a loss. I don‚Äôt know how to have something ‚Äòtalk‚Äô to my local like prefect was when the worker was live. \n\nI could set up windows task scheduler but tbh when I first started I inherited a bunch of them and hated the transfer process/setup. My boss would also like to be able to see the ‚Äòfailures‚Äô if any happen. \n\nWe have things like bitbucket/s3/snowflake that we use to host code/data/files but basically always pull them down to our local/ inside Alteryx.  \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated and I‚Äôm sorry for any incorrect terminology/lack of understanding.

        "content": "Issue: you want to increase the value of the data stored, where the data comes from disparate sources, by integrating it (how does X compare to Y) but the systems have inconsistent Master Data / Dimension Data\n\nCan anyone point to a text, Udemy course, etc. that goes into detail surrounding these issues? Particularly when you don't have a mandate to implement a top-down master data management approach?\n\nOff the top of my head the solutions I've read are:\n\n1. Implement a top-down master data management approach. This authorizes you to compel the owners of the source data stores to conform their master data to some standard (e.g., everyone must conform to System X regarding the list of Departments)\n\n2. Implement some kind of mdm tool, which imports data from multiple systems, creates a \"master\" record based on the different sources, and serves as either a cross reference or updates the source system. Often used for things like customers. I would assume now MDM tools include some sort of LLM/Machine Learning to make better deicisions.\n\n3. within the data warehouse store build cross references as you detect anomalies (e.g, system X adds department \"Shops\" - there is no department \"Shops\", so you temporarily give this a unknown dimension entry, then later when you figure out that \"Shops\" is department 12345 add a cross reference and on the next pass its reassigned to 12345.\n\n4. force child systems to at least incorporate the \"owning\" systems unique identifier as a field (e.g, if you have departments then one of your fields must be the department id from System X which owns departments). then in the warehouse each of these rows ties to a different dimension, but since one of the columns is always the System X department ID, users can filter on that.\n\nAre there other design patterns I'm missing?",

        "author": "eMperror_",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi,\n\nOur main OLTP database is an RDS Aurora Postgres database and it's working well but we need to perform some analytics queries that we currently do on a read replica but some of those queries are quite slow and we want to offload all of this to an OLAP or OLAP-like database. Most of our data is similar to a time-series so we thought of going with another Postgres instance but with Timescale installed to create aggregate functions. We mainly need to keep sums / averages / of historical data and timescale seems like a good fit for this.\n\nThe problem I have is how can I keep RDS -> Postgres in sync? Our use-case cannot really have batched data because our services need this analytics data to perform domain decisions (has a user reached his daily transactions limit for example) and we also want to offload all of our grafana dashboards from the main database to Timescale.\n\nWhat do people usually use for this? Debezium? Logical Replication? Any other tool?\n\nWe would really like to keep using RDS as a source of truth but offload all analytics to another DB that is more suited for this, if possible.\n\nIf so, how do you deal with an evolving DDL schema over time, do you just apply your DB migrations to both DBs and call it a day? Do you keep a completely different schema for the second database?\n\nOur Timescale instance would be hosted in K8s through the CNPG operator.\n\nI want to add that we are not 100% set on Timescale and would be open to other suggestions. We also looked at Starrocks, a CNCF project, which looks promising but a bit complex to get up and running.",

        "author": "klenium",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Imagine that we have a pipeline and 100s of tasks inside it. Some tasks are depend on others so we can fill dependency trees. But not just one, as there are subsets of tasks that do not depend on any other subsets of tasks. So those subsets can run parallel (as without dependency connection they can be started immediately by the platform).\n\nI work in Databricks, which does not allow limiting the number of in-progress tasks at once. If there are too many in-progress tasks, the driver node may receive too large workload and crash.\n\n1. Upscale driver: I do not need this, I could wait for normal, slower, cheaper run.\n\n2. Add a normal dependency from the end of A subtree to the beginning of B subtree. This way I can limit the number of in-progress tasks, but if something in A fails, B will not start. Also it messes up lineage reporting.\n\n3. Same as #2 but the dependency type is All Done. The problem is that if something in A fails, B is started and if it finishes successfully, the pipeline hides the error from A.\n\n4. Create \"dummy tasks\" as checkpoints, connect 10 tasks to the first, checkpoint, connect another 10 ... This would kill the overall performance.\n\n5. Create separated workflows to all dependent subset of tasks, and use All Done connection type between them, and set up error reporting to the sub-workflows.\n\n6. Dynamically start tasks based on the current workload. This would add extra maintenance, manual dependency processing.\n\nDo you have any better solutions?\n",

Is there still a realistic chance for someone like me (zero experience, but good German skills and strong tech learning) to break into the German job market‚Äîespecially in Data Engineering, Cloud Engineering, or even DevOps (I know DevOps is usually a mid-senior role, but still curious)?\n\n\n2. Do you think the job market for Data Engineers in Germany will improve in the next 1‚Äì2 years? Or is it becoming oversaturated?\n\n\nI‚Äôd really appreciate any honest thoughts or advice. Thanks again for reading.\n",

        "content": "I'm working on some data pipelines for a new source of data for our data lake, and right now we really only have one path to get the data up to the cloud. Going to do some hand-waving here only because I can't control this part of the process (for now), but a process is extracting data from our mainframe system as text (csv), and then compressing the data, and then copying it out to a cloud storage account in S3.\n\nWhy compress it? Well, it does compress well; we see around \\~30% space saved and the data size is not small; we're going from roughly 15GB per extract to down to 4.5GB. These are averages; some days are smaller, some are larger, but it's in this ballpark. Part of the reason for the compression is to save us some bandwidth and time in the file copy.\n\nSo now, I have a spark job to ingest the data into our raw layer, and it's taking longer than I \\*feel\\* it should take. I know that there's some overhead to reading compressed .gzip (I feel like I read somewhere once that it has to read the entire file on a single thread first). So the reads and then ultimately the writes to our tables are taking a while, longer than we'd like, for the data to be available for our consumers.\n\nThe debate we're having now is where do we want to \"eat\" the time:\n\n* Upload uncompressed files (vs compressed) so longer times in the file transfer\n* Add a step to decompress the files before we read them\n* Or just continue to have slower ingestion in our pipelines\n\nMy argument is that we can't beat physics; we are going to have to accept some length of time with any of these options. I just feel as an organization, we're over-indexing on a solution. So I'm curious which ones of these you'd prefer? And for the title: ",

It took me quite some time to decide to move to fullstack web since I felt for a long time that web dev was like pounding a square peg through a round hole (and it still feels like that in some aspects), but the JS eco-system is fantastic these days. And JS truly runs everywhere.\n\nSomething that's always amazed me is how some people like to spend their energy on bashing the new stuff that comes along. And it's always about focusing and exaggerating the negative sides. It has reached a point where I'm compelled to give new tech extra attention if it's heavily criticized by other programmers.\nBack in the day those who programmed Visual Basic where \"script kiddies\" and when React and Node came out it received tons of negative opinion only to dominate a few years later.\n \nSo on this note I've lately focused on using AI as much as possible when programming. And I think it's bloody fantastic if used right. And by right I mean to let it do small well defined tasks and integrate into your app. Not prompt it to build an entire app so that you don't understand and can maintain the code.\n\nEspecially CSS/Tailwind which I hate passionately. Just give the layout you want to the AI and let it grind until it looks right.\n\nI get that it can be tempting for new programmers to copy paste AI generated code they don't understand into a project, which is not a good idea. But the \"don't use AI if you're new is just silly in my opinion. A great aspect with AI is that you can have it explain programming concepts \"like I'm five\".

By profession, I used to be  an admin staff in healthcare. \n\nI do legacy codes. Grateful I was trained, but didn't expect the work to be like this. I was only trained about the fundamentals, nobody trained me how to probe/investigate, do tickets, do testing in production. They showed me a couple of times and trusted that I should know it off the bat. \n\nGave me a senior level ticket in the first sprint, nobody even taught me how the management system works inyl after it was requested. They have limited resources and documentation about it as well. So I was constantly asking around but at the same time they don't want me to ask me too much. How can I learn if there's no resources? \n\nThey want me to perform like them, this means glorified OTs so I can 'learn' Dude, ive only been trained for 2 and a half months. I dont know what everybody's talking about, I didn't even know what jira was before this lol. \n\nBy the way im only paid 4 dollars per hour, they outsourced in my country hence the pay, but..still.\n\nAnd oh yeah, on top of that, I was tasked to train someone(not in my contract) about everything \n\nI want to quit, I had my hopes up since I've been wanting to do programming for so long and was promised a better future.\n\nIs this what it's really like? Cause, Jesus, i feel like vomitting from anxiety everytime I log in for work. Oh yeah to top it off, I work night shifts, no night diff, no benefits.\n\nPros is I work from home. Thats it \n\n",

Last year during my algorithm classes, I was able to write code myself (in C) and do well in oop(sadly it was taught in python so they didn't teach us much besides classes and basic stuff). The problem began when we were tasked of building an rpg game using a library we didn't know (pygame) in about a month. So I used AI a lot and since then I had been using Ai to code most of my stuff (even my personal projects). The problem began when we had a course where we had to build a full stack app in c# and angular. I made most of the project with Ai again, and was able to understand and explain it quite well. But when it came to do it myself, I found myself lost and didn't know what I should start by doing. I could only code when the steps were told to me clearly. \n\nSo my question is, how do I relearn programming? Where do I start? From the beginning? I actually do enjoy creating stuff and I enjoy coding when I know what to do. I really want to work in this field (development in general) and I don't want to be incompetent when I have my bachelor's. Any advice? ",

I felt proud.\n\n, but nothing stays still so I wanted to improve more, but here it hit me I didn't have a goal nothing to look for not only in python, but in programming as a whole and didn't that only not make me know what to focus on, but also now I stopped feeling enthusiastic whenever somebody starts to say learn x I just feel ...tired exhausted and the worst part is that I like writing code I just have no goal no big grand goal.\n\nAnd keep in mind when I started to try to get better at python I chose to choose another language and kept bouncing between languages so that made my progress decrease a lot and probably was one of the biggest reasons is why I don't want to learn its because I just want to code.\n\nI am just here to whine if you want to help somehow do so I won't stop you and thanks, but I just did this because no one in my family could understand what I am saying so I decided to say it to people who will understand what I am talking about.\n\nif you have passed through this please help\n\nthanks for hearing me ramble for this long.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nHello,\n\nI wanted to end this on a happy note so here we are\n\nI just finished my first real project\n\nits a todo list cli tool a proper cli tool made in python you could install it by following the instructions in the repo, sadly its only available on Linux and also don't expect much its just a normal todo list just for me to learn through it json, and making a proper project etc\n\nI would be very happy if anybody installed it but no pressure\n\nhere is the link\n\n[https://github.com/Omar-Arabi1/Todo\\_list\\_cli\\_tool?tab=readme-ov-file#](https://github.com/Omar-Arabi1/Todo_list_cli_tool?tab=readme-ov-file#)\n\nso yeah I found my way in the end and thanks to all of you for commenting or even caring and a big thanks to who installed the program\n\nsee you later",

        "author": "lefteyenine",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Came across with them via a sponsored video and ran through a few threads here about what people think about it.\n\nLet this be the newest one on them:\n\nGamifying the learning process is a clever idea getting more and more adopted by especially more arduous skill acquisition like that of programming.\n\nAlthough [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) promotes on it, \"gaming\" is not emphasized. It's about doing the application, giving the correct answer and leveling up which eventually awards you with chests that yield sitewide currencies/items you spend to keep going on. I didn't try them out yet but Codedex looks more of a gamified service.\n\n\"Holding hands\" approach was the point of criticism from what I saw and I can confirm although I can't critique the service on the method - there are times where a total beginner would be baffled.\n\nHowever, that's where their \"Socratic\" AI called Boots comes in - you can ask him questions and he will proceed to jog your memory by asking you new ones. That might be frustrating to some, especially in cases where you need an outright explanation to a part of the code that was not explicitly taught before.\n\nI did not feel outcasted while getting from zero to half way into Functions tutorials and this is a very good aspect. I respect vendors who do not entice by \"look at this amazing feature you are missing out since you are on free\" and rather convince you by proving their merits and generating the feeling that they are worth your financial support if you are able.\n\nI am from Turkey and I saw purchasing power parity discount on top of the promotion one so that's another plus for people like us who are crushed under their evil governments' poor management.\n\nI am in no way affiliated with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) \\- I just felt I needed to pay my respects for offering a more-free-than-premium service who also care about where you are from. Programming-wise, I think there would be better people who are seasoned enough to comment on their curriculum and pace of progress.\n\nCheers.",

The \"100 Days of Code\" challenge keeps popping into my head, but I'm not sure if it's the right fit for someone with my level, considering I'm quite familiar with various tech stacks.\n\nOn one hand, the structure and public commitment could be great for pushing me to explore new technologies. It might also be a good way to build a more visible portfolio of recent work.\n\nHowever, I'm also wondering if the \"every single day\" commitment is realistic. I'm also concerned that the focus might be more on the streak itself rather than on the quality and depth of what I'm learning. \n\nI'd love to hear from other experienced developers who have tried or considered the challenge.",

I am learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript entirely for a large creative project that I have dedicated most of my life to. It will be unpaid and freely available and I do NOT expect to gain anything financially from it.\n\nI also am not interested in a career in CS, which is relevant because the vast majority of resources about the question I have pertain to those who want to be hired. I do not care; I just want a smooth implementation of my ideas.\n\nI am currently using a Linux VM on my windows pc to learn. I like the simplicity of it, the separation from my main files(in some manner) and all the bash stuff. I have two monitors. One I dedicate to the tutorials(windows side, because the VM runs videos and other things slowly) and the other I dedicate to all my practice and coding and all that. This has worked well for me so far, but I would like to know if this will cause me issues in the future.\n\nAll my writing files for this project are in google docs or libreoffice, the former because I tend to write on a laptop away from home and need a way to keep it synced. Most of my non-coding development for this project happens on windows, as well as other things like browsing or playing games. \n\nMy question is this: should I plan to scoot over to Linux permanently at some point? Should I dual boot? Should I plan to transfer my knowledge to Windows after this course is finished(Odin project, of course)? Should I dual boot? \n\nIf the answer to these are ‚Äúpersonal preference‚Äù I am completely okay with that. I am just seeking guidance, know the pros and cons for my situation, and I do not need Linux for the purpose of being marketable for companies(which is what people mention whenever this question comes up online, for good reason.)",

I also know that AI will replace some tech jobs, but as AI evolves, I have to think new human roles in tech will evolve too.

I'm here to ask for some tips and advices for both personal and carrier growth. \n\nSome years ago, after university, I had to start from beginning to change my work carrier and for the first time, I've approached to the coding world. I love it.  I took a master in data science, then I continued to study, c# and unity for game developer. I was hired as data scientist but few months later, the project ended and I was moved in another segment in the same society, as solution architect, with something that really wasn't suit for me. So, I spent some months for a master in devops and I finally could ask to change another team, this time in a team of integration. My team works as middle ware,  and I could learn a lot about microservices, api, Aws tools and such that we have as infrastructure. \n\nSo, I decided to stop trying to learn from others and start study, again, in order to have a robust knowledge of the entire process, end to end. So, with the chance to see how some lambda function (Aws) was integrated into other tools, I asked to write a new one that was needed for a new application. Following all pipeline and integrate it into cloud watch. Was a good work (both cause I used cdk libraries, but mostly cause I saw how pipelines really work in production, as a player and not just spectator). \n\nBut in the end, the more I learn, the more I find out new stuff, that probably should have been discovered ten years ago at the university. So, right now, I'm trying to study about spring boot and Java, nodejs, maven, camel and how to make whole works together, in order to write good api/web app. \n\nNow, I feel full of stuff I don't know, and in my future I would like to have the chance to work as software dev, solution architect or whatever, cause I feel like all these worlds overlap somehow, somewhere.\n\nThat said, I kindly ask for some suggestions:\n\n1)where should I start?\n2)what should I prioritize? \n3)im not gonna lie, I'm using a lot chatgpt or Claude to study, like asking focused questions, like usage, best practice, asking for exercises and dig down every time I have a doubt, but, because I always been a self taught in this world, I have no idea if there are books, documentations or whatever that can be exhaustive and valid.\n\nI know can be confusing, but I'm very confused right now. The moment in your life when you realize you know enough to be where you are, but not enough to go much further. \n\nThanks for your time ",

        "content": "First of all I'll give some context:\n\nWebsite is made using a template in HTML, CSS and JS. Its hosted on Vercel with a custom domain. Its not a static website and uses a server behind the scenes for stuff like \"serving\" the html files from a public folder and contact.html so that people that visit the website can send us messages (That's also why its not hosted on Github). It uses NodeJS, ExpressJS and other Javascript libraries for having the server capabilities. Now I have not really studied and worked on ExpressJS and all but I was able to vibe-code it (I know I'm sorry but its my dad that wanted the website really quick).\n\nFast forward to present day and my dad wants a blog page in the website. Now I asked copilot in VSCode to do do it for me but turns out it got really complicated. I setup a database schema in supabase connected to vercel and then it started spewing out all these lines of code that didn't work at all and I got confused. (`POST /api/blog`, `GET /api/blog` etc)\n\nSo what my dad wants is that he should be able to make posts preferably with images and thats it. When I first heard of it, I thought maybe he would also like people to be able to comment and like on posts as well. Well he has clarified that he just wants the first part only. Now the thing is how should I go about it. I have 2 choices:\n1. Use something like what copilot gave me (Use GET methods along with response and requests) (Gonna have to learn it from YT tutorials and docs since \"AI slop\")\n2. Create a simple posts.json file and loading the posts from that website using JS script. (Only issue would be how to add images in a json file; maybe base64 encoding would work; base64 is quite heavy though). And then create a Flutter app that allows my dad to create, edit and delete posts and when he clicks on submit, it would automatically get pushed onto my vercel repository in production.\n\nFirst approach seems better to make it look like a proper production application whereas the second approach is a just a make-shift thing\n\nWhich one do you think I should work on? And if there's something you'd like to add, please tell me.\n\nPS: I'm more of a machine learning kind of guy and not frontend and all",

After more than a year, when I was offered a job working with C# I decided to switch again.\n\nUnfortunately, that company turned out to be a poor fit. They refused to adopt modern patterns, and the codebase was in a terrible state. And after six months, I moved on to another C# role, hoping for a better experience. But again, the codebase was a mess, and the work was split roughly 75% frontend and 25% backend.\n\nSince I had to work on the frontend, I started learning TypeScript. I really enjoyed many of the concepts and examples I came across while learning it, but sadly, the actual codebase I worked with didn‚Äôt reflect any of that what I learned and there was no room or time to improve that was already there.\n\nFor the full picture: in addition to my 40-hour work week, I would often spend another 40 hours learning and building proof of concepts. You could say programming was my life.\n\nI started doubting if it wasn‚Äôt time to do something else and when another type of job came along I stepped off the programming wagon. \n\nI expected I would get my enjoyment in programming back in the hours that I used to make besides my work, but instead I just stopped programming all together.\n\nNow more then 2 years further I‚Äôm willing to pick it up in my sparetime again.\n\nBut i don‚Äôt want to do course after course. I‚Äôm also not really sure what language I want to pick up. Not what to build.\n\nThe main advantage of typescript is that I can write frontend and backend code with it. I could pick up c# or even try f# (always loved the functional syntax). I could go back to php? Or maybe try out rust or elixer? Just thinking about it makes me want to quit again? So maybe I‚Äôm not ready to pick it up again.\n\nI wonder if anyone has some advice to break out of this? Although I do enjoy my current job. I do want to get back into software development eventually.",

        "author": "alex_sakuta",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Modern programming languages, especially dynamic languages have a really good thing going for them which is there is a library for pretty much everything you want to do which is wrapper that makes it easy for you to do the thing without ever having to understand the core architecture of how something is happening.\n\nFor example, talking about JS env: Need servers? Express. Need sockets? Socket.io. And so on.\n\nThis makes it really easy tod develop application quickly and unfortunately that's all that an organisation would care for too.\n\nIn my resume if someone sees a chat application, they don't care if I implemented the web socket architecture or I just used a library. They may ask that stuff in an interview and still not mind that I used a library.\n\nNow, I have found out that, that I'm really dumb. I had been using web servers for an year in JS and only recently I figured out the entire architecture when I had to build an HTTP server from scratch in C. It has been a huge challenge and still is.\n\nI also learnt how to implement an event loop. But would any company care about these skills if I don't have any decent project? I don't think so.\n\nBut, keeping my own subjective thinking and personal experiences aside, I had a doubt.\n\nIf I learn how to apply a concept without first trying to understand it completely, is this a good strategy?\n\nLike because I learnt Express, I had an easy time creating macros for implementing routes in my C HTTP server. I just imitated a syntax similar to that in C.\n\nOn the other hand, had I never used Express, I don't think my abstraction of routes would be like the way Express has and don't know if it would have been this good which it is now.\n\nSo, clearly the learning of the application helps the learning of architecture just as much as learning the architecture helps learning the application.\n\nWith this, what do you suggest:\n\n- Learn application first, no matter how you do it.\n- Learn architecture first and then design your own and learn application through that instead of a simply using libs.\n- A mid ground, learn architecture, learn application using whatever tool is necessary and then if one wishes, one can design their architecture from scratch as well.",

Usage of (appropriate) design patterns\n2. Scalability, and performance considerations\n3. Big O complexity considerations and usage of relevant, appropriate data structures\n4. Inclusion of additional functionality, so if I had a to do app, including it to be available on mobile/cloud (such as using streamlit from python) would elevate it\n5. Real world/life functionality, such as expansion of use cases to encompass practical, business domains and situations.\n6. A project that is specific/applicable to a specific domain, such as an anti-money laundering detection project within banking, or fraud detection within a commercial website/ banking\n7. Good code practices: clean, concise, modular code, with adherence to principles such as Single Responsibility Principle for functions, usage of seperation of concerns, abstracting data from logic\n8. actually including a well-written README file that details the functionality and use cases associated with the project within the git/github repository, with appropriate commenting of novel/atypical processes within the program.\n9.

Talking in stand-ups is generally fine, but sometimes you find that you use the same words or phrases every time.   \n3. Asking questions and knowing when to ask questions is difficult.   \n4. Listening, especially when there are native speakers, provides some challenges. By the time you understand something, the topic has moved on.  \n5.

        "author": "Upper-Freedom-4618",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm a 27-year-old career switcher. I have a Econ degree (2020), and spent the last 5 years in finance-related roles. I've been teaching myself to code for the last 7 months (great timing, I know). \n\nAt first I was just doing it for fun, but then it became one of the more meaningful parts of my life. I used to think I liked finance, but really I just liked saying \"stonks go up\". By contrast coding is predictable, controllable, you eventually can figure out where you f\\*cked up, and how you can improve. It's a kind learning environment.  And in that there is peace. \n\nBut I feel like I was just about 2-3 years too late on that realization. \n\nA couple months ago, I was very confident I could make it as a professional developer. Now I don't know. There's a lot of fear-mongering and apocalyptic prophesying going on. Some say AI is going to wipe out junior dev jobs. Some say there will still be plenty of demand but you‚Äôll need to be more senior-level faster. And junior postings are way down. Layoffs everywhere.\n\nHow the heck are we supposed to know what to focus on, when everything's up in the air?\n\nI've done alot of research and experimenting with all these roles, some thoughts: \n\n* **Front-end** / **Web Design** \\- S.O.L\n* **Full-stack** \\- somewhat better, but very generalist skillset\n* **Back-end -** pretty good open vis-a-vis AI defenseability, good way to niche-up\n* **Cloud** / **DevOps** \\- clearest path to employment, good balance of supply/demand\n* **MLE / MLOps** \\- highest demand, but very low base pool, and I don‚Äôt have a stats/ML background\n* **Blockchain** \\- thought about it given my finance background but very sketch \n* **Data Science / ML** \\- did a bootcamp, not fan of stats \n\nExploring all of these definitely set me back on the web stack, but I did finish The Odin Project, the first half of Full Stack Open (Core Course, 5 credits), and partially through a milion other courses on Scrimba, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev), Coursera, etc. \n\nI'm also considering a master‚Äôs to hedge my bets, hoping that by the time I come out the other end in 2-3 years, the markets will have settled. No idea if worth it, but on the other hand grinding projects feels pointless with the current freeze on junior hires. \n\nSo my question is this. \n\nWhat path should I focus on as a self-taught dev with no degree, in this brutal market for junior devs? Should I target back-end, cloud, or something like MLOps? Is a master‚Äôs a smart move, or should I double down on projects and networking? \n\nAny advice would be mucho appreciated, thanks!",

The price that I saw two to three days ago and the current price are different, so do keep that in mind.

And all of this for working for someone else eventually for 800-1200$ a month in my case(Russia). \n\nThe question is: is it possible to learn some specific skills in programming such as making a website or a WhatsApp bot and earning a solid money selling these products as a freelancer? I have a friend(a programmer) who said that it's impossible, any business owner would choose a firm over a freelancer, and as a freelancer i won't be able to make  good money doing this. I mean, i want to be on my own, May be the field isn't for me? Because before i spend 1-2 years studying something, i want to know is there any prospects for me? Will i be able to launch my own firm doing this? Will i be able to make a good quality product a website for example for a business owner or is programming a team job, not for a solo worker? \n\nThx for the answers, I'm sorry if the question is stupid. \n\nAdded: also I've checked freelance platforms such as upwork and fivver. A bot for 3$, a site costs 15$ . Are they real prices? Are you all studying programming to land a job in the end? ",

How could i transition from where i am currently to progress further.\n\nI have never touched programming books or any biographies, i have only previously tried to get inspiration from others code, developing off examples on libraries and writing stuff, getting to a point where i am stuck and reverting to AI, baffling my flow and resulting in lacks of motivation where i am supposed to be in control of software im writing, but it takes over and becomes another sequence of hoops i need to jump through to even get anywhere.\n\nAny feedback towards my situation would help me so much, im looking forward to spending an extended period over the summer to try to become the best i can be, an end goal trying to create a product with some revenue so i can fund a community project that ive wanted to do for a while. \n\nThanks for reading",

Here is how I would break it down.\n\n1. **Understand the problem first (3 mins)**¬†\\- restate it back, walk through examples, ask about constraints.\n2. **Don't code immediately (5 mins)**¬†\\- discuss approaches starting with brute force, explain why it's bad, then work up to optimal solution. DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION. You don't have time for that.\n3. **Get buy-in (10 mins)**¬†\\- make sure interviewer agrees with your approach before coding. I write pseudocode comments first as an outline, then flesh it out. A common failure pattern is coding something that the interviewer doesn't understand.\n4. **Wrap up (2 mins)**¬†\\- explain time/space complexity, offer to write tests for edge cases, or move on to the next problem.\n\n**How I prepared:**\n\n* Use Blind 75. It has good coverage over all problems.\n* I DID NOT buy leetcode premium. If you study and understand the patterns, it doesn't matter what problem you get.\n\nI know the market is ass right now and the competition is rough, but stay disciplined and the hard work will pay off!

        "author": "nysoxfan01",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "95% of this subreddit is people complaining about the job market or AI.  The remaining 5% of actual advice is straight up garbage and completely outdated.  Thought I would help out by making a list of things that will greatly improve your job search\n\nAs a background, I have 6 years of Software Engineering experience and have worked with people of many backgrounds.  I have never worked at FAANG, went to a mediocre school with mediocre grades, never had an internships or anything like that.  But I have also never been unemployed.  This isn't for the .1% of people, this is for the common CS man (or woman).  And if you were asking, I'm a U.S. citizen in the U.S. market.  If you are neither of those this probably won't apply to you.\n\nWith that out of the way here's what I have gathered from my experience:\n\n**1. Apply to local/hybrid jobs in non-tech hubs.**  \nYour goal is to reduce competition as much as possible.  When I first started I would literally filter jobs on linkedIn to states nobody wanted to live in, like Ohio.  You will be given jobs in locations that people don't even know exist.  A lot of them have barely any applicants.  If they are desperate enough they will hire you.  Another tip would be to update your resume to have your location be within the same area, since companies might filter you if you are located too far away\n\n**2. Make sure your resume is concise.**  \nWhen I review resumes I hate ones that have tons of wordy bullet points that basically say nothing.  Don't dilute your resume with crap.  Most people have 1-2 important projects they have worked on at a company and a bunch of filler work.  Just focus on the important stuff and make sure it is clear what you actually did.  Also PLEASE do not use arbitrary percentages in your bullet points.  I hate this advice so much just put what you actually worked on.  It doesn't matter how the business benefitted we all know that is the point of work.\n\n**3. Similar to 2, make sure your technical skills are concise**  \nIf you put every tool or technology it looks like you have very little experience in lots of things.  Focus on putting skills that are needed for the job you are applying to.  Another easy approach is to take the skills you are best at (say React), and filter only for jobs with React.  Then do the same thing with Angular etc.\n\n**4. If you don't have any experience (or limited) YOU NEED TO DO PROJECTS**  \nYou need some way to show that you have some sort of technical knowledge or drive.  You don't need a github, but you should have projects that you can explain how they work.  This is especially crucial for internships.  My company just hired an intern that was the CEO/Cofounder of a startup.  Her startup? Building websites with other students for various people.  Sounds stupid, but it got her an internship.\n\n**5. Just straight up fucking lie**  \nI don't want to endorse this, but I just want people to know who they are competing with when they send out 500 applications without a response.  We hired someone who had experience as a software engineer.  But they accidentally told me they were a QA at their last role.  I checked their linked in and they were listed as a software engineer.  So yeah, if you work in tech support, QA, product.  Doesn't matter, you were a software engineer\n\n**6.  Same as number 5**  \nThis is more reasonable in my opinion because recruiters are stupid.  If you have React experience and applying to a job with Angular, congrats - you actually have Angular experience.  Same with Java and C# etc.  The important thing is you are able to actually pass an interview for this stuff.  It is worth it to review core concepts and maybe do a few leetcode problems in that language.  At the end of the day you need a job\n\n**7. Interview advice: be honest but not too honest**  \nWhen I was interviewing for a job I wanted they asked me a common interview question about a time I failed.  So I told them a real story about how I messed up getting requirements and caused a delay in the release.  I didn't get this job.  The next job I applied to asked the same question, so I told the same story but rephrased it where product threw a bunch of requirements at me last minute and I had to work overtime to get things across the finish line.  I did get this job.  You get the idea\n\n**8. Do not negotiate**  \nThere's a lot of people on this sub that will scold you for not negotiating.  But I have seen first hand peoples' offers get rescinded for negotiating, especially in this market.  Just accept the damn offer once you get to this stage.  Every job I've gotten when I negotiate I got $5k more on top of the initial offer which is not worth risking losing an offer over.  I simply asked if there was any wiggle room and they gave me basically the same offer\n\n**9: For students: do not waste your time**  \nSeriously, start applying/working on projects as early as you can.  Grades hardly matter.  I knew a dumb kid that had a 4.0.  It didn't make a difference when it came to getting a job.  He could have spent some of his time studying instead building a react app or something and gotten a 3.7 and been better off.  Take as many easy classes as possible and focus on learning on your own time.  Most CS classes I've taken taught be .01% of my current CS knowledge\n\n**10: Make sure everything is up to date, even when employed**  \nKeep your resume up to date with your latest experience.  Try to check LinkedIn/Indeed once a week or so.  I've seens job boards get flooded with really good jobs one week, which all get removed the next.  You never know when that next opportunity is going to be available so it's good to always be looking.",

        "content": "I‚Äôm really terrible at Reddit formatting, so this will probably seem like a blob of text. \n\nSo many people are incorrectly saying that AI is the driving reason for the mass layoffs, non-hiring, and the downward trend of anything software development related. \n\nAI is a _contributing_ factor to the *difficulty* of getting hired at entry level positions at companies, but that‚Äôs a standard bar push. \n\nBut what‚Äôs *truly* influencing the mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and shrinking investment into developing proprietary and innovative technologies in America isn‚Äôt AI. \n\nIt‚Äôs a tax credit rewrite that was never supposed to take effect. \n\nLaw and legislation is boring, but this piece specifically, is important for all of you. It impacts your life, your industry, how you‚Äôre paid, what the Chief Financial Officer sees and uses to justify paying you six figures, and your tax rebates if you‚Äôre planning to start or work in a startup.\n\nI‚Äôm going to lay out the facts in a (hopefully) objective way. \n\nThe credit I‚Äôm talking about:\n\nThe Research and Development Tax Credit under IRC Tax Code 174. \n\nEDIT: Edits will be for formatting. \n\nThe law that changed it:\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (specifically under section 13206). \n\n\n\nThis provision was initially drafted by Kevin Brady (R-TX), and advocated significantly for by Republican lawmakers. \n\n\n\nThe House of Representatives vote:\n\n227 Republicans For\n\n13 Republicans Against\n\n\n\n0 Democrats For\n\n192 Democrats Against\n\n\n\nThe Senate vote:\n\n51 Republicans For\n\n0 Republicans Against\n\n\n\n0 Democrats For\n\n47 Democrats, and 2 Independents Against \n\n\n\nThe final result:\n\nSigned into law by President Donald Trump on December 22, 2017. \n\n\n\nDate it took effect:\n\nJanuary 1, 2022\n\n\n\nWhy so late?\n\nA fun, gimmicky workaround to the Byrd Rule and to delay costly tax hikes until after the 5-year mark, while cashing in on any revenue after the 10-year mark. \n\n\n\nIn short, it was a play to look fiscally responsible, but didn‚Äôt provide any tax cuts. It just kicked the can down the road and offset immediate tech conglomerate backlash. \n\n\n\nThey assumed that this provision would be removed or indefinitely delayed by future Congress, but they didn‚Äôt. \n\n\n\nPrevious:\n\n\n\nPrior to 2022, businesses were able to immediately (same year tax break) cash in and deduct R&D expenses, including software developer and other IT professionals‚Äô salaries, IT infrastructure changes, engineer innovation in all sectors, and more. \n\n\n\nAfter 2022:\nAll of the expenses covered by the R&D credit now has to be capitalized and amortized. \n\n\n\nFor domestic research, they are required to amortize over 5 years. \n\n\n\nFor foreign research, they are required to amortize over 15 years. \n\n\n\nMeaning that, prior to 2022, a $1M investment into software development and cyber security would be fully deductible for fiscal year 22. \n\n\n\nNow, that same $1M investment into those same fields would only allow for $200k to be deductible for the fiscal year, and the remaining $800k would need to be spread out over the remaining four.\n\n\n\nWhich resulted in layoffs, frozen hiring, cash flow strain for startups and tech firms, and immediate tax burden on companies employing R&D-based that persists to today. \n\n\n\nBUT! There is a bipartisan bill that‚Äôs going through Congress right now to reverse it and retroactively apply the lost tax credits back to businesses from 2021 forward, but we‚Äôll see where it goes!",

And unless you‚Äôve already worked in the industry, you likely have no idea what enterprise development even *looks* like.\n\nOne Google search will throw you into a rabbit hole of 20 unfamiliar technical keywords, and suddenly you‚Äôre trying to engineer a business-scale architecture for a portfolio project.

        "content": "I joined a startup about a year ago, fresh out of grad school. I was really excited. My role was to explore how we could use large language models and build AI systems to improve our content and automate workflows. I was mostly a backend engineer, creating APIs, and I loved it.\n\n\nA little while ago, our CEO suddenly decided our company needs to be \"AI first\". On the surface, that sounds great for someone in my role. But the execution is becoming a nightmare. Any complex technical challenge I bring up gets dismissed with a wave of his hand and a simple, \"Oh yeah just write a prompt and develop it fast\".\nWe are now in a phase where we are actively breaking things that already work perfectly fine, just to rebuild them the \"AI way\". The logic seems to be that if it doesn't use a large language model, it's obsolete, which makes no sense.\n\nThe worst part, however, is what this has done to my job. The CEO now expects every engineer to own the entire product process from start to finish. This means we are all now responsible for writing long product requirement documents, creating wireframes, coding the frontend, developing the backend APIs, and then deploying and integrating everything ourselves.\n\nI chose a career in engineering specifically because I did not enjoy product management. Now, it's a core part of my job. And when concerns are raised about the massive new workload and lack of experience in these areas, the response is just, \"Oh yeah just use ChatGPT to write the document\".\n\nMy work feels less meaningful every day. I went from being a specialized engineer working on interesting AI problems to a generalist doing a bit of everything, without any real depth or focus. My passion for coding and building robust systems is fading. It feels like my actual engineering skills are being devalued in favor of someone who can just prompt an AI for a passable solution to everything.\n\nIs this what the future of tech work looks like? Are other companies operating this way?\n",

I wasn't actually expecting anything great because a couple weeks ago I was told that they still wanted to interview other candidates, but surprisingly the recruiter started giving me information about the job including what my exact salary would be, the bonus, etc. All details that were not concrete at this point.\n\nI was a little confused so I asked \"Is this you firmly giving me a job offer\" and the reply was \"Here at MC we don't give job offers, this is a calibration.\"\n\nStill confused, I tried to get more information and said I was interested and said I wanted to discuss with my wife. The recruiter said that is okay, but let me know in a few hours. I asked for the weekend to think it over and said I would get back Monday. This seemed okay but said she would need the answer soon because of other candidates.\n\nTruthfully I have another final round that I am hoping to hear good news back from next week, but wanted to know if anyone had ever heard something similar about them not calling the job offer an actual job offer?",

How can you plan to make major life decisions like starting a family knowing you can lose your job at any time and potentially be unemployed for months. Many people are rightfully angry about it but blaming the wrong causes. \n\nIt‚Äôs true that offshoring is caused by far lower salaries in other countries but we don‚Äôt look any deeper than that. We assume it‚Äôs a good thing because the US is a ‚Äúrich‚Äù country and assume everyone else is extremely poor and desperate. We ignore that we have a huge cost of living crisis primarily driven by our insane housing costs no where higher than in Silicon Valley. \n\nThe primary cause of our high housing costs are nationwide restrictive zoning laws that prevent the supply of housing from meeting the demand and making it extremely difficult and expensive to build anything. r/yimby has great discourse on this issue if you want to learn more. \n\nIt‚Äôs impossible for Americans to compete because we would literally be homeless if we were paid equivalent salaries in the countries they are offshoring. I also worry that it is fueling \nracist backlash against certain groups. \n",

        "content": "Basically, there‚Äôs a huge budget cut for my employer and layoffs are very likely to happen, and so they have offered to everyone what is essentially 7 months pay to quit. This is in hopes that enough people take the offer and unwanted layoffs can be avoided. However, if not enough people take it, then layoff will have to happen. I‚Äôm a mid-level developer, and unfortunately most of my workforce are seniors so basically I‚Äôm in the chopping block and one of the first to leave if layoffs happen.\n\nI‚Äôm torn. I‚Äôm earning six figures in a low cost of living area, like my job, still good work life balance despite the recent mess (not company‚Äôs fault), however, chances of layoffs are high. But, there‚Äôs still a chance. Is a gamble.\n\nI got the job straight out of college and haven‚Äôt need to apply for a dev job in several years. Now that I‚Äôm looking to see how‚Äôs the market, I‚Äôm terrified since it seems very bad. So my question is, is the CS job market really this terrible? Am I better off hoping I don‚Äôt get layoff‚Äôd? I think 7 month is pretty decent to find a new job, I would be looking at NYC or DC but can move anywhere tbh. What would y‚Äôall do in my position? I‚Äôm trying to make a decision within a week and is so hard!\n\nThanks y‚Äôall!\n\nTLDR: layoffs very likely to happen, however still a chance it doesn‚Äôt occur. Earn six figures and like my job. Is the CS job market really bad for mid-level devs? Do you recommend taking 7 months pay and look for new job or is the market very terrible and I‚Äôm better off risking it and staying?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've helped a lot of students & early-career folks with job hunting, and one fear comes up all the time: **networking**. So many people are scared they'll say the wrong thing, or that their message will just get ignored.\n\nTotally get it! I've been there too. But based on what I‚Äôve seen from job seekers who‚Äôve actually landed roles (including some who started with zero connections), here are some tips that really work:\n\n\n\n**1. Start with a 15 min coffee chat**\n\nDon‚Äôt overthink it. You‚Äôre not asking for a job. You‚Äôre just asking for 15 minutes to get to know the other person‚Äôs position. Most professionals remember what it felt like in the beginning, and they‚Äôre happy to help.\n\nYou can say something like, ‚ÄúHi \\[name\\], I‚Äôm currently studying \\[major\\] and exploring career paths in \\[field\\]. If you‚Äôd like to chat with me for 15 minutes, I‚Äôd love to hear about your experiences.‚Äù\n\n\n\n**2. Build rapport: \\~2 min**\n\nDon‚Äôt jump right into the subject. Start by warming up with a friendly opening line:\n\n‚ÄúHow are you doing today?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre having a great week, thank you for your time!‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs a small thing, but it can create a relaxed atmosphere and make both parties feel more comfortable.\n\n\n\n**3. Introduce yourself: 2-3 min**\n\nKeep it brief and to the point. Think of it like your LinkedIn verbal summary.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm currently a Data Analytics student at \\[school\\] and I‚Äôm really interested in marketing analytics. I‚Äôve worked on projects with A/B testing and Tableau dashboards, and I‚Äôd love to learn more about what careers in this field really look like.‚Äù\n\nConfidence comes from clarity of thought: if you know what you want, you‚Äôll be ten times more confident when you speak your mind.\n\n\n\n**4. Ask two good questions: \\~10 min**\n\nThis is where you learn. Try:\n\n‚ÄúWhat do you like most (and least) about your job?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHow did you get into this field?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you graduated today, what would you focus on?‚Äù\n\nAvoid asking generic questions like ‚ÄúHow is your company?‚Äù Just try to show curiosity and depth.\n\n\n\n**5. Follow up consistently**\n\nSend a quick thank you note and ask if they‚Äôd like to stay in touch. That‚Äôs it. Relationships are developed through follow-up, not one-off chats.\n\n\n\n**Tips:**\n\n\\- If you don't hearing back so far: Try alumni, smaller companies, or people who are 1-3 years ahead of you. They‚Äôre often more responsive than FAANG executives.\n\n\\- Feeling nervous all the time? Write a pitch and practice it with a friend before the actual chat.\n\n\\- Keep a spreadsheet of who you reached out to, when, and what you learned.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre afraid of networking, you‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôve been there. Take the first step and you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised at where it leads.\n\n\n\nHas anyone else networked their way into your first job? How did you succeed?",

The manual testing, red team engagements, and report writing are draining asf. My boss keeps pushing for more certifications.\n\nDon't even get me started on getting pinged at all hours because pipelines \"don't work\" - only to find out some dev forgot to do a proper build on their machine, the build failed, and they blamed the CI pipeline. Between the low pay at both companies and all this stress, I'm burned tf out.\n\nAt this point, I genuinely despise cybersecurity, software development, and even the data science BS I'm learning at university. \n\nI've got multiple offers from banks and other solution companies in both fields with way better pay, but I feel paralyzed.

I've mostly been doing the typical entry level guy stuff - add a GUI option to automate this database change we get hit with a lot, learn our no/low code platform and help us convert legacy apps to it, help us change this PDF export, all that kind of stuff. A few apps we maintain are getting moved to the cloud over the next year, and I've expressed interest with the managers in helping with that. Overall, it seems really laid back and everyones being extremely helpful as I learn and giving me more than enough time (and space) to do everything. \n\nI'm in a LCOL area, and the job is hybrid (2 days a week in office), I get great health insurance, and I'm just really thankful to have a job! Honestly, I love it. My coworkers are great, everyones so chill, it's a laid back environment, an absolute dream to me coming out of my last job. That being said, pay is on the low end of the scale ($60,000) and I get it - I have no practical experience. I'm ok with starting here and taking a pay cut from my last role, but I do have ambition. I'm worried that I'm not gaining experience on new and cool tech stacks, I'm worried about the no code app conversions. I want to grow, and level up my income. \n\nWhat are some things I should be doing to make the most of this opportunity?",

But there is this nagging feeling that I would be leaving benefits that would be impossible to get back.\n\nI am excited of the opportunity that my software would be used by tons of customers from day one instead of me having to ‚Äúsell‚Äù our new results to other scientists. But maybe I am thinking too much of a grass is green on the other side?",

When I started working, things were a bit different I am required to go twice a week (any that I choose tho) and I do have to work from 8 to 5. I just coped with it and started working accepting the new conditions, I was happy, I usually disconnect at 5pm and study German and do some certifications so I can improve at my job :) I had no clear, measurable goals but I didn‚Äôt mind it, after all, I am completely new to the labor market. I got assigned to basically help out a senior who didn‚Äôt quite give me much responsibility, I did some architectural initiatives and digital transformation little projects fitting for an intern job. But he didn‚Äôt give me a lot of them and mostly told me to help out with documentation, which I didn‚Äôt mind that much because after all it is necessary. Never had a bad feedback, I even presented all I worked on to my boss and she told me that all was rly good and if I was comfortable in the company which I responded to with a yes. \n\nHR decided to call me two weeks ago to tell me that I wasn‚Äôt gonna have my contract renewed because they asked my boss and she told them no because I lacked ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù, they were even impressed with me not knowing my boss had felt this. I felt like it was totally my fault but bit by bit I am thinking I am not the one that did everything wrong and that it is completely my fault. Also, we have a new boss (boss of my boss) and this guy totally skips my direct boss to text me always outside working hours (once it was 6 pm, another at 7 and the most recent was a message this Friday at 9pm) which I always reply at 8am in the morning, and he never replies until he just texts me days after after working hours once again, am I wrong here? I asked my mother and she ask me I had to always reply and she even got mad because I told her that it was outside my working hours.

I started a new one at a company that I heard amazing things about, how everyone was great and how leaders were super supportive, I was genuinely excited.\n\nI started in January, onboarding was a bit messy but eventually I figured it out, I had my first oficial feedback session on 09.04, all positive, a few things to improve but the official document statement said that I was on track to complete my 6 months probation. Ever since that feedback I didn‚Äôt have any other official feedback, my manager and I talked about projects, I worked on improving what I had to improve, all our conversations were positive. There was going to be a offsite next week - well this is still happening, but I‚Äôm won‚Äôt be there - where my manager were telling me things and activities for the team. She doesn‚Äôt live at the same city that I do, so Tuesday (10.06) was the first time we‚Äôve met in person, we talked about the offsite, she was very friendly and then, Wednesday, on our regular 1:1, not even like a separate meeting, she says that I did not completed it the requirements and therefore I was no longer at the company. I asked for examples of what was wrong, she didn‚Äôt tell me, I asked why she didn‚Äôt say it before, she had 02 months to provide more feedback saying what was not working and helping me in what I needed, I mean, is her job too, she invested time, money and energy to hire and train me but ,she didn‚Äôt say anything either.

        "author": "Valuable_Mall228",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I graduated 3 years ago, it's a bit of a personal story, and one that I'm honestly not sure how to share with an employer but here it is (the story can be skipped as I don't know if it's relevant to my situation, regardless of why, I haven't been employed in industry for 3 years):\n\nAt around the time of my graduation date I stumbled across the Amber Heard Johnny Depp trial. Amber Heard really reminded me of my brother but I wasn't sure why. As she got diagnosed with NPD and BPD I looked into it and the covert narc description happened to completely match my brother.\n\nI had a lot of mental health challenges growing up but I managed to keep it together when it came to my education. Got A\\* Maths, A\\* Computer science A-levels, graduated CS with a First-Class Integrated Masters from a reputable university. But when I came across this piece of news my whole world flipped upside down. So many things started to make sense and I went through a wild emotional rollercoaster. Hadn't cried in 10 years since I was 13 but for at least 2 weeks I would be weeping 6hrs/day and I honestly didn't know what to make of my life.  \nI had to get a job fast after graduating since I didn't want to live back home so I got hired at McDonalds. My mental health was fragile during this time and it took me 6 months to get a job in retail. Only a year after that had I actually started applying to CS jobs.\n\nAs soon as my CV hit the market I started getting calls from recruiters, at least 2 calls/week. I started making some progress with some companies but a friend of mine from McDonalds hit me up and convinced me to start a business. It's a long story with him, but basically he came to the UK by selling his business for 40K pounds. He had a small thing where he bought bicycle parts in some dodgy auction and used them to make bicycles and sell them. He worked at McD to earn the rest of what he needed to pay off his tuition fee (he had to pay 21K/year as he was not from the EU/UK). I resonated with the idea of being self-employed and the guy seemed competent enough and I thought YOLO, why not.\n\n3-4 months into that whole process I realised I really craved some financial security and it'd be a waste not to use my degree. So I quit and started applying to jobs again. I got very close with a video game apprenticeship (was the 11th applicant out of 300 but they only had 10 positions). And I also got an interview for a job through a uni connection that went really well. I had been given a call and was told that I have the job! just have to be on the lookout for HR to contact me. No contact, I stayed in touch via email and eventually called and the hiring manager told me he doesn't know what's happening and the job seems to be in the air. He's signed everything and so has his boss he is just on lookout for the final business approval. He told me he'll contact me if anything changes, so I can only assume nothing changed.\n\nAfter this whole foray I was a little bit low and my friend sweeps in again to offer me to start our own thing. Great timing. Won't go into the details of that but we did a lot of work but were delayed by waiting for my passport to arrive from Romania to the UK as we needed ID to start the business bank account. Just when we were starting to do outreach and get some customers the guy started behaving very poorly towards me. Very passive aggressive, would tell me to do shit for him, etc. When I confronted him about it he called me sensitive, etc. I just couldn't deal with that kind of behaviour so we split up.\n\nIt's been a while at this point since I actually graduated and I learned so many things about myself. I thought for a while maybe I don't want to do CS and I went on to try to be self-employed. It turns out I'm a little too fragile for that at the moment, I don't quite have enough self-determination for it and I've lived for 2.5 years in a constant state of anxiety (as my current workplace is quite toxic and demanding as well). I just need a little bit of breathing room and some financial stability to pull myself together enough to actually attempt something like that.\n\nThis brings me to now, 3 years later, applying to jobs yet again but now I'm honestly worried since it seems like the market is not in a great place, and my gap is getting quite large.\n\nIs there any point in me applying to CS related jobs at the moment? Does anyone have any advice for how to stand out in this market given this disadvantage?",

I'm interested in trying a larger city with more tech companies and less friction in the job market (not implying it's easier to get a job, just more options).\n\nHowever, having bought a house, moving is a bit more complex and expenses are now quite a bit higher. It's not as easy to pick up and move as when I was renting and had less stuff. I'm curious if any of you have gone through something similar and would have any tips. Did you use a new job to manage a relocation, or did you make it work without having to move jobs? Any tips, regrets, or expectations that either held true or were broken? I'm eager to hear about others' experiences.\n\nEDIT: Most comments received have been about cost of living. I'm very financially aware that moving somewhere more populated correlates with an increase in housing cost. I'm more interested in experiences others have had; please don't suggest I'm naive and that if I only looked at the numbers harder, I'd realize I'm crazy for wanting to do what I've outlined above. I'm not. It's truly a case of suffocating from the isolation of remote work and a small town; an increase in cost of living is something I can afford and would happily do so if it helps me feel more integrated with other people around me.",

Been here for about 3 months but haven‚Äôt gotten assigned to a project yet so it‚Äôs been slow. I just had a recruiter reach out to me for an ‚ÄúAutomation Developer‚Äù role (not entirely sure what this is, they said it wasn‚Äôt related to QA/testing but the role requires knowledge of things like Python and APIs. They said there would be things like daily standups and they use Jira etc). This is for a very well known fortune 50 company and the compensation is $10000 higher than my current WITCH role (still way below industry standard for a dev role, however). They said it‚Äôs a 12 month contract, not sure if this is a contract to hire situation though‚Äîthey‚Äôve been a bit vague on that. The recruiter is from an agency and not from the company itself.\n\nIs it worth switching into this role if I eventually want to be an SWE? My concern is that I might get pigeonholed into this ‚Äúautomation‚Äù work and not be able to move to a more traditional SWE type role. Also this is a W2 contract whereas I‚Äôm employed full-time at the WITCH. Any thoughts on what to do in this situation? Do I decline this new opportunity and focus on gaining experience with WITCH clients as a data engineer or should I move to the fortune 50 for the name brand on the resume/actual work experience? Any input or thoughts would be highly appreciated.",

        "content": "Hello. I've been working for around 2.5 years in a startup as a senior backend engineer.\n\nWhen I started, we were 2 on the team, under the CTO. 1 person left. We hired someone terrible, and we didn't continue with him after a few months. I proposed to not replace this person with anyone because the workload was ok-ish just for me. I was the only backend engineer for more than one year, managing (successfully) around 1/3 third of the product (several microservices etc).\n\nDuring this period, the CTO was changed because of investors' wishes. A few months back, we hired a couple of more people for my team, but they are nowhere close to my productivity or domain knowledge, and are on-par or below my general technical knowledge. \n\nI get along with everyone, I have good communication skills, and I've gotten 2 raises during this time. This is why I was expecting to become a Tech lead when it was time to have one.\n\nUnfortunately, we (i was included in the call) are interviewing for an external technical lead. This has been extremely disappointing. When asking my CTO, he said that they wanted someone with experience in leading teams who could effectively help with the refactors that we need, and so on.\n\nI'm more than capable (or at least that's what i think) of planning and managing long projects and make them happen through incremental steps, but this new CTO has never let me do that because he always proposes more long-term, breaking refactorings. So we are kind of stuck in urgent things and bugs (that obviously should not happen on the first place) and not moving forward with the important topics.\n\nI have the impression that they (the CTO and the CEO) have already made the decision not to count on me to promote to teach lead, because otherwise they would have, at least, spoken with me about what I'm not good at or something.\n\nSo Im wondering if it make sense to push for it anyway. For example, writing a detailed technical proposal of the refactors that we need, and having another conversation with my CTO. But one part of me thinks that this would be a waste of my time and would only lead to an uncomfortable conversation in which no one wins. \n\nWhat do you think? Any similar experience? Thanks!",

I feel like traditional CS masters programs are pretty CS foundations focused (i.e algs, data, machine learning) and I don't see many that focus on user interfaces... I also stalked all of the senior engineers I work with, and none of them have masters. I advocated for myself in the workplace and get to work on the UI for internal tools which is fun.\n\nI currently live in SoCal and don't want to move for a full-on in-person program. Is it even worth it to get a masters? I've found some certificate programs and I believe my company will pay up to $700 per credit. If I were to look for more sr roles with my CS degree already, would a certificate help? When the time comes for me to jump for a sr role I would have at least 5+ years of experience.\n\nI just want to really be a front end engineer who really works on making beautiful UIs that are easy to use, accessible, and look great.

I could only handle 1 class/semester, so the earliest I would finish is December 2028.

I would then have a bit under 2 years of traditional dev experience + WGU credential/skills to transition from.\n\nI'm curious on opinions from this sub on which path seems better? I would learn more & have a more prestigious credential from GT, but by the time I finished, does that beat (potentially) already being an ML Engineer for 2 years with the WGU path?

One is SRE at a company that is mid-sized, tech/AI oriented, enterprise, good recent funding, seems really stable, GlassDoor reviews seem positive, unlimited PTO (that reviews say was usually approved), has good benefits but would require relocating. Another is SWE at a smaller start-up ish, can't find any info online about their revenue and funding, almost no GlassDoor reviews, no unlimited PTO, 7 year old e-commerce company.\n\nSalary wise due to relocating they both kind of wind up being the same net for me.\n\nMy brother who's worked as a Product Manager at Microsoft for a few years (but never worked in SWE) is telling me that the smaller company SWE position w slightly worse benefits is much better because the industry is so competitive right now that if you only have experience as an SRE it'll be hard to pivot to other roles in the future, and that it's a much better setup for my future career than an SRE role. He also said that it's better to work at a e-commerce marketplace company because the skills will be more transferrable and a lot of FAANG type companies will like that, whereas the enterprise AI company experience wouldn't be as direct.\n\nAnother engineer I talked to said the job titles don't matter that much, I'll only be able to tell once I start the job and know exactly what I'm doing that I'll know how useful the learned skills are, best I can do is look at the job description.\n\nSo I'm torn on what to do. If the job titles were the same I'd go with the mid-sized company 100%. But since the smaller company where I'm not sure about the work culture has the better title *and* doesn't require me to relocate I'm really not sure. Any advice on what it seems like the better role is, if SWE is that much better as my brother says it is? Idk I feel like the SRE position is at a company with such a stronger future. \n\nIf it helps, the SWE role works with C#, they said I'll be doing some QA and automation with Selenium. The SRE role will be working with Playwright and Kubernetes. I have no idea which of those skills would be more useful in the industry and neither does my brother/other engineer friend lol.",

Thank you\n \nI‚Äôm currently a software engineer at Microsoft with 5 years of industry experience(mobile developer for a major product). Over the past few years, I‚Äôve developed a deep passion for philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, and the ethical and societal implications of emerging technologies. I believe my long-term goal is to work as an AI ethics researcher, ideally contributing to both academic understanding and practical guidance for organizations building impactful systems.\n  \nTo pursue this, I‚Äôm considering enrolling in a Master‚Äôs in Philosophy to gain formal training in foundational and conceptual frameworks(philosophy of mind and ethics focus), with the eventual goal of pursuing a PhD in Computer Science or a related interdisciplinary field that focuses on AI ethics.\n  \nThat said, I‚Äôm wondering if a single Philosophy master‚Äôs is the most efficient path‚Äîor if it might be worthwhile to simultaneously pursue a second Master‚Äôs in Machine Learning or Computer Science. I recognize this may extend the timeline, but I‚Äôm genuinely passionate about building a strong, cross-disciplinary foundation and want to make sure I‚Äôm well-prepared to contribute meaningfully in both technical and ethical domains.\n  \nMy key questions are: \n \n* Is a PhD necessary to break into impactful AI ethics research, or can a Master‚Äôs degree (or two) be sufficient?\n* Would pursuing two Master‚Äôs degrees in parallel (Philosophy + ML/CS) make sense, or would you recommend a more focused route?\n* Are there specific programs or schools you would recommend for someone with this interdisciplinary focus?\n* Finally, does this path tend to offer long-term job security and practical opportunities in industry at major labs?\n  \nThank you so much for your time and any advice you can share‚ÄîI deeply appreciate it.",

        "author": "YMMVwithme",

        "content": "Hey guys, here‚Äôs my situation. I‚Äôm a full stack software engineer at a midsize non-tech company (but still well known) with 4.5 YOE (1.5 YOE in data analysis before that, so I guess 6 YOE total). I‚Äôve been cold applying for remote software engineering roles but I‚Äôm not really getting any bites. I know the remote market is insanely competitive right now, but I‚Äôd really like one and I‚Äôm only considering switching roles if the new one is remote.\n\nFor some more background, I have an unrelated bachelors from an Ivy League school. I have a feeling that this is one of the main reasons I‚Äôm not getting much traction - I‚Äôm probably being filtered out immediately at a lot of places for not having a CS degree, especially in this market. I was getting a good chunk more interviews 2-3 years ago.\n\nLately, I‚Äôve been contemplating doing a MSCS to make up for that shortcoming. Last year, I got accepted into GT OMSCS but I decided to not attend after thinking heavily about the time commitment. It would‚Äôve taken me about 3 years and I would‚Äôve completely had to sacrifice my quality of life due to the programs rigor. I have a wife and now a baby on the way, and my wife and I are ready to expand our family even further in the short term future, so I just didn‚Äôt think it was worth the sacrifice. Plus, now it‚Äôs been a year so my offer of admission is no longer valid anyway.\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing. WGU just came out with an MSCS that I think I can get done in 6 months, if not a year. That time horizon and day-to-day commitment is a lot more palatable to be honest. Also, my employer is willing to pay for it 100%.\n\nAll that said, do you think it‚Äôs worth it for me to do the WGU MSCS so that I can meet the CS degree requirement at a lot of places/avoid getting filtered out early in the process? The way that I‚Äôm thinking about it is that I can always take it off my resume if I feel it‚Äôs causing a negative impact on my profile. What do you guys think? Would it be beneficial to my profile or make it worse? At this point, it‚Äôs either WGU MSCS or nothing - I‚Äôm just at a point in my life where I‚Äôm done with higher education otherwise and want to focus on life itself, so I‚Äôm not considering any other masters programs.\n\nI do have 3 YOE working remotely due to COVID and I‚Äôve reflected that on my resume, plus some promotions, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a track record issue.",
