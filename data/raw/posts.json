But 90% of the data quality issues we get paged for are because the business logic changed and no one told us.\n\nA product manager wouldn't launch a new feature in an app without defining what quality means for the user. Why do we accept this for data products?\n\nWe're treated like janitors cleaning up other people's messes instead of engineers building a product. The root cause is a lack of ownership and clear requirements *before* data is produced.\n\nDiscussion Points:\n\n* Am I just jaded, or is this a universal experience?\n* How have you successfully pushed data quality ownership *upstream* to the product teams that generate the data?\n* Should Data Engineers start refusing to build pipelines until acceptance criteria for data quality are signed off?\n\nLet's vent and share solutions.",

Sprints are packed with too many tickets, story points that make no sense, and tasks that are way more complex than they look on paper. You start a sprint already behind.\n\nEven if you finish your work, there’s always something else. A pipeline fails, a deployment breaks, or someone suddenly needs “a quick fix” for production. It feels like you can never really log off because something is always running somewhere.\n\nIn my current team, the seniors are still online until midnight almost every night. Nobody officially says we have to work that late, but when that’s what everyone else is doing, it’s hard not to feel pressured. You feel bad for signing off at 7 PM even when you’ve done everything assigned to you.\n\nI actually like data engineering itself. Building data pipelines, tuning Spark jobs, learning new tools, all of that is fun. But the constant grind and unrealistic pace make it hard to enjoy any of it. It feels like you have to keep pushing non-stop just to survive.\n\nIs this just how data engineering is everywhere, or are there actually teams out there with a healthy workload and real work life balance?\n",

I’m autistic and I struggle with the constant presentations, storytelling, and meetings that come with more “business-facing” roles.

I haven’t worked with Spark, IaC, or devops yet, but I like that kind of technical challenge.\n\nI’m not looking for advice per se, just wanted to share my thoughts and see if anyone here has had a similar experience, moving from a data or analytics-heavy background into something more engineering-focused.",

I like that it feels more structured day-to-day, but I’d basically be starting from scratch learning it.\n\nWith just 16 months left and visa rules changing, I’m nervous about making the wrong choice.\nIf you’ve worked in either field, what’s your honest take on this?\n\nBased on my profile, i might struggle to land an entry-level ML job cos I only have one year of internship experience. I’d really appreciate your recommendations.

The end datasets combine data from different sources we normalize in our database. The issue I’m facing is that stuff that seems to have been ok-ed a few months ago is suddenly not ok - I get grilled for requirements I was told to put, if something is inconsistent I have a colleague who gets on my case and acts like I don’t take accountability for mistakes, even though the end result follows the requirements I was literally told are the correct processes to evaluate whatever the end user wants. I’ve improved all channels of communication and document things extensively now, so thankfully that helps point to why I did things the way I did months ago but it’s frustrating the way colleagues react and behave to unexpected failures while im finishing time sensitive current tasks. \n\nOur pipelines upstream of me have some new failure or the other everyday that’s not in my purview. When data goes missing in my datasets because of that, I have to dig and investigate what happened that can take forever, sometimes it’s a failure because of the vendor sending an unexpectedly changed format or some failure in the pipeline that software engineering team takes care of. When things fail, I have to manually do the steps in the pipeline to temporarily fix the issue which is a series of download, upload, download and “eyeball validate” and upload to the folder that eventually feeds our database for multiple datasets. This eats up my entire day that I have to dedicate for other time sensitive tasks and I feel there are serious unrealistic expectations. I log into work first day out of a day off with a bulk of messages about a failed data issue and have back to back meetings in the AM. I was asked just 1.5 hours of logging in with meetings if I looked into and resolved a data issue that realistically takes a few hours….um no I was in meetings lol. There was a time in the past at 10PM or so I was asked to manually load data because it failed in our pipeline and I was tired and uploaded the wrong dataset. My manager freaked out the next day,they couldn’t reverse the effects of the new dataset till the next day, so they found me incapable of the task but while yes, it was my mistake of not checking it was 10PM, I don’t get paid for after hours work and I was checked out. I get bombarded with messages after hours & on the weekend. \n\nEverything here is CONSTANTLY changing without warning. I’ve been added to two new different teams and I can’t keep up with why I am there. I’ve tried to ask but everything is unclear and murky. \n\nIs this normal part of DE work or am I in the wrong place? My job is such that I feel even after hours or on weekends im thinking of all the things I have to do. When I log into work these days I feel so groggy. ",

It is a hybrid role with 2 days per week in the office in London.\n\nThe positives of the role are as follows:\n- Quite good WLB (Only about 10 hrs per week actual work)\n- Good non-toxic culture with friendly technical and non technical colleagues who are always happy to help\n- I have been able to upskill in the role, and now have skills in Python, SQL, Java, DevOps, machine learning, ETL pipelines, GCP, business analysis, basic architecture design and SRE for maintaining data products.\n\nThe negatives are as follows:\n- Low TC (only £60k TC) in London\n- Unclear how I might get a promotion in my organisation.\n\nDue to the good WLB mentioned above, I have used time to learn new skills and learn value investing and because I live with my parents I have been able to build a fairly good portfolio for my age.\n\nI am soon going to buy a flat however so I will not be able to invest as much in the near future.\n\nWhat should I be focusing on? Because although I partially think I should look for another highest TC role, the grass isn’t always greener, so I might be better off milking this good WLB role for all its worth then pursuing some kind of entrepreneurial venture alongside it, because that could have potentially unlimited upside with low downside if my corporate role provides a margin of safety, and if that takes off I could become a full time entrepreneur.\n\nWhat thoughts/advice do people have?

        "content": "Hey everyone,\nI’m currently doing a Data Engineering internship (been around 3 months), and I’m honestly starting to question whether it’s worth continuing anymore.\n\nWhen I joined, I was super excited to learn real-world stuff — build data pipelines, understand architecture, and get proper mentorship from seniors. But the reality has been quite different.\n\nMost of my seniors mainly work with Spark and SQL, while I’ve been assigned tasks involving Airflow and Airbyte. The issue is — no one really knows these tools well enough to guide me.\n\nFor example, yesterday I faced an Airflow 209 error. Due to some changes, I ended up installing and uninstalling Airflow multiple times, which eventually caused my GitHub repo limit to exceed. After a lot of debugging, I finally figured out the issue myself — but my manager and team had no idea what was going on.\n\nSame with Airbyte 505 errors — and everyone’s just as confused as I am. Even my manager wasn’t sure why they happen. I end up spending hours debugging and searching online, with zero feedback or learning support.\n\n\nI totally get that self-learning is a big part of this field, but lately it feels like I’m not really learning, just surviving through errors. There’s no code review, no structured explanation, and no one to discuss better approaches with.\n\nNow I’m wondering:\nShould I stay another month and try to make the best of it,\nor resign and look for an opportunity where I can actually grow under proper guidance?\n\nWould leaving after 3 months look bad if I can still talk about the things I’ve learned — like building small workflows, debugging orchestrations, and understanding data flow?\n\nHas anyone else gone through a similar “no mentorship, just errors” internship?\nI’d really appreciate advice from senior data engineers, because I genuinely want to become a strong data engineer and learn the right way.\n\n\nEdit\n\nAfter going through everyone’s advice here, I’ve decided not to quit the internship for now. Instead, I’ll focus more on self-learning and building consistency until I find a better opportunity.\nHonestly, this experience has been a rollercoaster — frustrating at times, but it’s also pushing me to think like a real data engineer.

        "author": "ThqXbs8",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# Samara\nI've been working on Samara, a framework that lets you build complete ETL pipelines using just YAML or JSON configuration files. No boilerplate, no repetitive code—just define what you want and let the framework handle the execution with telemetry, error handling and alerting.\n\nThe idea hit me after writing the same data pipeline patterns over and over. Why are we writing hundreds of lines of code to read a CSV, join it with another dataset, filter some rows, and write the output? Engineering is about solving problems, the problem here is repetiviely doing the same over and over.\n\n## What My Project Does\nYou write a config file that describes your pipeline:\n- Where your data lives (files, databases, APIs)\n- What transformations to apply (joins, filters, aggregations, type casting)\n- Where the results should go\n- What to do when things succeed or fail\n\nSamara reads that config and executes the entire pipeline. Same configuration should work whether you're running on Spark or Polars (TODO) or ... Switch engines by changing a single parameter.\n\n## Target Audience\n\n**For engineers**: Stop writing the same extract-transform-load code. Focus on the complex stuff that actually needs custom logic.\n**For teams**: Everyone uses the same patterns. Pipeline definitions are readable by analysts who don't code. Changes are visible in version control as clean configuration diffs.\n**For maintainability**: When requirements change, you update YAML or JSON instead of refactoring code across multiple files.\n\n## Current State\n- 100% test coverage (unit + e2e)\n- Full type safety throughout\n- Comprehensive alerts (email, webhooks, files)\n- Event hooks for custom actions at pipeline stages\n- Solid documentation with architecture diagrams\n- Spark implementation mostly done, Polars implementation in progress\n\n## Looking for Contributors\nThe foundation is solid, but there's exciting work ahead:\n- Extend Polars engine support\n- Build out transformation library\n- Add more data source connectors like Kafka and Databases\n\nCheck out the repo: [github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara](https://github.com/KrijnvanderBurg/Samara)\n\nStar it if the approach resonates with you. Open an issue if you want to contribute or have ideas.\n\n---\nExample: Here's what a pipeline looks like—read two CSVs, join them, select columns, write output:\n\n```yaml\nworkflow:\n  id: product-cleanup-pipeline\n  description: ETL pipeline for cleaning and standardizing product catalog data\n  enabled: true\n  \n  jobs:\n    - id: clean-products\n      description: Remove duplicates, cast types, and select relevant columns from product data\n      enabled: true\n      engine_type: spark\n      \n      # Extract product data from CSV file\n      extracts:\n        - id: extract-products\n          extract_type: file\n          data_format: csv\n          location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products/\n          method: batch\n          options:\n            delimiter: \",\"\n            header: true\n            inferSchema: false\n          schema: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/products_schema.json\n      \n      # Transform the data: remove duplicates, cast types, and select columns\n      transforms:\n        - id: transform-clean-products\n          upstream_id: extract-products\n          options: {}\n          functions:\n            # Step 1: Remove duplicate rows based on all columns\n            - function_type: dropDuplicates\n              arguments:\n                columns: []  # Empty array means check all columns for duplicates\n            \n            # Step 2: Cast columns to appropriate data types\n            - function_type: cast\n              arguments:\n                columns:\n                  - column_name: price\n                    cast_type: double\n                  - column_name: stock_quantity\n                    cast_type: integer\n                  - column_name: is_available\n                    cast_type: boolean\n                  - column_name: last_updated\n                    cast_type: date\n            \n            # Step 3: Select only the columns we need for the output\n            - function_type: select\n              arguments:\n                columns:\n                  - product_id\n                  - product_name\n                  - category\n                  - price\n                  - stock_quantity\n                  - is_available\n      \n      # Load the cleaned data to output\n      loads:\n        - id: load-clean-products\n          upstream_id: transform-clean-products\n          load_type: file\n          data_format: csv\n          location: examples/yaml_products_cleanup/output\n          method: batch\n          mode: overwrite\n          options:\n            header: true\n          schema_export: \"\"\n      \n      # Event hooks for pipeline lifecycle\n      hooks:\n        onStart: []\n        onFailure: []\n        onSuccess: []\n        onFinally: []\n```",

So if someone has has watched these and tell me what I can expect.\n\nAs for databricks, am I just using a community edition? with snowflake the free trial is enough to complete a book.\n\nThanks again, I learn by doing so please dont just tell me to look at the documentation (I wont learn anything reading it, and I dont have time the plan out a project which can conveniently cover all bases) !

It's **not production-ready**, just a sandbox for testing and learning.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* It has three Python data generators for a realistic mix:\n   1. **Transactional (CDC):** Simulates MySQL changes streamed via **Debezium** & **Kafka**.\n   2. **Clickstream:** Sends real-time JSON events to a cloud API.\n   3. **Ad Spend:** Creates daily batch CSVs (e.g., ad spend).\n* **Terraform** provisions the entire AWS stack (API Gateway, Kinesis Firehose, S3, Glue, Athena, and Lake Formation with pre-configured user roles).\n* **dbt** (running on Athena with Iceberg) transforms the data, and **Dagster** (running locally) orchestrates the dbt models.\n\nRight now, only the AWS stack is implemented. My main goal is to build this *same* platform in **GCP** and **Azure** to learn and compare them.\n\nI hope it's useful for anyone else who wants a full end-to-end sandbox to play with.

For example setup an etl pipeline complete with cicd deployment for all envs will just cost you a 3 story point.. Besides usually the tickets just have the title, no description whatsoever. Assignee is responsible to find out information about the tickets. And i also got comments on things like i will need to have more accountability on the projects, I mean its just been 6 months.\n\n\nAnd there are 2 other seniors, both of them are workaholic and they basically set the bar here. they spent time working exactly 12 hours average on daily basis. Additionally, why im saying my team is weird is because i have been doing research and been talking to otber teams. Lets just say only my team have ridiculous story pointings. They shout worklife balance and no need to work extra hours, but how can one finish their task without extras hours if workloads are just too much. \n\nHonestly, although i can push myself to be like them, i choose not to. Im already senior level and looking for a place to settle and work as long as i could.\n\n\nQuestion, will things get better? Should I stay or leave?

Many papers argue that hybrid systems allow you to leverage the strengths of each database without constantly migrating or overloading one system.\n\nHowever, when I read Reddit threads, GitHub discussions, and YouTube comments, most developers and data engineers seem to say the opposite, they prefer sticking to one single database (usually PostgreSQL or MongoDB) instead of maintaining several.\n\nSo my question is:\n\n**Why is there such a big gap between the theoretical or architectural support for polyglot persistence and the real-world preference for a single database system?**\n\nIs it mostly about:\n\nMaintenance and operational overhead (backups, replication, updates, etc.)?, Developer team size and skill sets?, Tooling and integration complexity?, Query performance or data consistency concerns?, Or simply because “good enough” is more practical than “perfectly optimized”?\n\n**Would love to hear from those who’ve tried polyglot setups or decided against them, especially in projects that mix structured, unstructured, and analytical data. Big thanks! Ale**",

        "content": "Hi all!\nI am a data engineer by trade and I am currently working on a project involving streaming data in from an s3 parquet table into an ML model hosted in ec2 (specifically a Keras model). I am using data generators to Lazy load the data with pandas wrangler and turn it into a tensor. I have already parallelized my lazy loads, but I’m running into a couple of roadblocks that I was hoping the community might have answers to. \n1. What is the most efficient/standard way to lazy load data from an s3 parquet table? I’ve been iterating by partition (utc date + Rand partition key) but it’s a pretty slow response time (roughly 15 second round trip per partition). \n2. My features and targets are in separate s3 tables right now. Is there an efficient way to join them at load or should I set up an upstream spark job to join the feature and target set to a single bucket and work from there? My intuition is that the load and x-process of handling that join for a disjoint set will be completely inefficient, but it would be a large data duplication if I have to maintain an entire separate table just to have features and targets combined in one parquet file. Any insight here would be appreciated!\nThank you!",

All on the starter subscription.\n\nThen, we sign up and pay, but who would know, EU support is now removed from the entry monthly plan. So EU data residency is now a paid extra feature.\n\nWe are told that EU data residency is for annual plans only, bit annoyed, but fair enough, so i head over to their pricing page to see the entry subscription in an annual plan. I contact them to proceed with this, and guess what, it is gone, just like that! And it is gone, despite (at this point) still being listed on their pricing page!\n\nOk, so after much back & forth, we are allowed to get the entry plan in annual (for an extra premium of course, gotta pay up). So now we finally have EU data residency, but now, all of a sudden the one important feature we were presented by their sales team is gone.\n\nWe already signed up now to the annual plan to get EU, so bit in the shit you can say, but I contact them, and 20 emails later we can get the dynamic configuration of destinations, if we upgrade to a new and more expensive plan.\n\nAnd to put it into context, starter annual is 11'800 USD for 7m events a month, so it is not like it is cheap in any way. God knows what we will end up paying in a few weeks or months from now, after having to constantly pay up for included features being moved to more expensive plans.\n\nIs segment, fivetran and the other ones equally as shit and eager with their enshittification? Is the only viable option self-hosting OSS or creating something yourself at this point?\n\nAnd what are you guys using? I have a few clients who need some good data infrastructure, and rest assured, I will surely never recommend any of them Rudderstack.",

As titled, am I Missing Hidden Costs/Tradeoffs?\n\nWe're a small shop, 5 data people, <10TB of production data.\n\nWe used to run our analytics in the production's read replica, but nowadays it always timed out / failed bcz of transaction conflicts.\n\nWe're storing a snapshot of historical data every day for audit/regulatory purposes (as pg dump and restoring it when we need to do an audit.\n\nWe're moving our data to a dedicated place. We're considering ingesting our production data to a simple iceberg/s3 tables and using Athena for analytics.\n\nBut we're also considering Redshift serverless + Redshift's managed storage, which apparently, the pricing for RMS ($0.024/GB) is now closly matches S3 Standard ($0.023/GB in our region). Our data is purely structured (Parquet/CSV) with predictable access patterns.  \n\nFor the compute cost, we estimated that the RSS will cost us <500$/mo. I haven't estimated the Athena cost query because I don't know how to translate our workload into equivalent Athena scan cost.\n\nWith either of these new setup, we will take a full snapshot of our postgres everyday and dump it to our datalake/redshift\n\nWhy I'm Considering Redshift:  \n\n\\- We're pretty much an all-in AWS shop now, not going to move anywhere in the quite long term.  \n\\- Avoid complex data lake/iceberg maintenance  \n\\- I can still archive snapshot data older than a certain period to the cheaper S3 tier when I need to.\n\nI'm coming here from the idea that I can have an exabyte of data on my storage, but that won't affect the performance of my DB if I don't query it.  \nOn Redshift, I'm thinking to achieve this by either 1. storing older snapshots on a different table or 2. using \"snapshot\\_date\" as a sort key so that unrelated data will be filtered when doing a query\n\nQuestion:\n\n1. Does this storage model make sense?\n2. Are there hidden compute costs? (from vacuuming/optimization)",

Because of that, I don’t want to lose any data tracked by the _CT tables and I discovered that changing the schema structure of the tables, may potentially end up with some data loss if no proper solution is found. \n\nI’ll give you an example to follow.\nI have the User table with Id, Name,Age, RowVersion. The CDC is enabled at db and at this table level, and I set it to track every row of this table. \nNow some changes may appear in this operational table\n\n1. I add a new column, let’s say Salary as DECIMAL. I want to track this column as well. But I don’t want to disable and enable again the CDC for this table, because I will lose the data in the old capture instance\n2. After a while, I want to ALTER the column Salary from DECIMAL to INT (this is just for the sake of the example).  Here, what I observed, is that after the ALTER state is run, the Salary column in CT table is automatically changed to INT which is weird that may lead to potentially some data loss from the previous data\n3. I will Delete the Salary column. The statement will not break but I need to update somehow the tracking for this table without the column. \n4. I will rename the Name column to FirstName. The rename statement will break because it will see that the column is linked to CDC\n5. I will rename the table from User to Users. This statement is not failing but I still need to update the cdc tracking to not let misleading naming conventions that may be confusing \n\nDid you encounter similar issues in your development? How did you tackle it?\n\nAlso, if you have any advices that you want to share related to your experience with CDC, it will be more than welcomed. \n\nThanks, and sorry for the long post\n\nNote: I use Sql Server",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm building a real-time data pipeline using Docker Compose and I've hit a wall with the Hive Metastore. I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction or suggest a better architecture.\n\nMy Goal:\nI want a containerized setup where:\n\n1. A PySpark container processes data (in real-time/streaming) and writes it as a table to a Delta Lake format.\n2. The data is stored in a MinIO bucket (S3-compatible).\n3. Trino can read these Delta tables from MinIO.\n4. Grafana connects to Trino to visualize the data.\n\nMy Current Architecture & Problem:\n\nI have the following containers working mostly independently:\n\n· pyspark-app: Writes Delta tables successfully to s3a://my-bucket/ (pointing to MinIO).\n· minio: Storage is working. I can see the _delta_log and data files from Spark.\n· trino: Running and can connect to MinIO.\n· grafana: Connected to Trino.\n\nThe missing link is schema discovery. For Trino to understand the schema of the Delta tables created by Spark, I know it needs a metastore. My approach was to add a hive-metastore container (with a PostgreSQL backend for the metastore DB).\n\nThis is the step that's failing. I'm having a hard time configuring the Hive Metastore to correctly talk to both the Spark-generated Delta tables on MinIO and then making Trino use that same metastore. The configurations are becoming a tangled mess.\n\nWhat I've Tried/Researched:\n\n· Used jupyter/pyspark-notebook as a base for Spark.\n· Set Spark configs like spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access=true, spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog, and the necessary S3A settings for MinIO.\n· For Trino, I've looked at the hive and delta-lake connectors.\n· My Hive Metastore setup involves setting S3A endpoints and access keys in hive-site.xml, but I suspect the issue is with the service discovery and the thrift URI.\n\nMy Specific Question:\n\nIs the \"Hive Metastore in a container\" approach the best and most modern way to solve this? It feels brittle.\n\n1. Is there a better, more container-native alternative to the Hive Metastore for this use case? I've heard of things like AWS Glue Data Catalog, but I'm on-prem with MinIO.\n2. If Hive Metastore is the right way, what's the critical configuration I'm likely missing to glue it all together? Specifically, how do I ensure Spark registers tables there and Trino reads from it?\n3. Should I be using the Trino Delta Lake connector instead of the Hive connector? Does it still require a metastore?\n\nAny advice, a working docker-compose.yml snippet, or a pointer to a reference architecture would be immensely helpful!\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm trying to modernize the stack in my company. I want to move the data transformation layer from qlik to snowflake. Have to convince my boss. If anyone had this battle before, please advice.\n\nFor context, my team is me (frustrated DE), team manager (really supportive but with no technical background), 2 internal analyst focusing on gathering technical requirements and 2 external bi developer focusing on qlik.\n\nI use Snowflake + dbt but the models built in here are just a handful, because I was not allowed to connect to the ERP system (I am internal by the way) but only to other sources. It looks like soon I will have access to ERP data though.\n\nCurrently the external consultants connects with Qlik directly to our ERP system, downloads a bunch of data from there + snowflake + a few random excels and create a massive transformation layer in Qlik.\n\nThere is no version control, and the internal analysts do not even know how to use qlik - so they just ask the consultants to develop dashboards and have no idea of the data modelling built. Development is slow, dashboards look imho basic and as a DE I want to have at least proper development and governance standards for the data modelling.\n\nMy idea: \n\nStep 1 - have ERP data in snowflake. Build facts and dim in there.\n\nStep 2 - let the analysts use SQL and learn DBT to have the \"reporting\" models in snowflake as well. Upskill the analyst so they can use github to communicate bugs, enhancements etc. Use qlik for visualization only\n\nMy manager is sold on step 1, not yet 2. The external consultants are saying that qlik workd best with facts and dims, instead of one normalized table. So that they can handle the downloads faster and do transformations in qlik.\n\nMy points to go for step 2:\n- qlik has no version control (yet - noy sure if it is an optiom)\n- internally no visibility on the code, it is just a black box the consultants manage. Move would mean better knowledge sharing and data governance\n- the aim is not to create huge tables/views for the dashboards but rather optimal models with just the fields needed\n- possibility of internal upskill (analysts using sql/dbt + git)\n- better visbility on costs, both on the computation layer as well as storage costs decreased \n\nAnything else I can say to convince my manager to make this move?",

They look at real-time train delay data in one feed, crew assignments somewhere else, and scheduled arrival and departure times in a third place, cross-referencing train numbers and crew IDs by hand. Then they compile it all into a list and relay that list to our crew assignment office by phone. It’s wildly inefficient and time consuming, and it’s baffling to me that no one has ever linked them before, given how straightforward the logic should be.\n\nI guess my question is- is this as simple as I’m assuming it should be?

        "content": "Hey folks,\n\nI am working at a large insurance company where we are building a new data platform (dwh) in Azure, and I have been asked to figure out a way to move a subset of production data (around 10%) into pre prod, while making sure referential integrity is preserved across our new Data Vault model. \nThere is dev and test with synthetic data (for development) but pre prod has to have a subset of prod data. So 4 different env.\n\nHere’s the rough idea I have been working on, and I would really appreciate feedback, challenges, or even “don’t do it” warnings.\n\nThe process would start with an input manifest – basically just a list of thousand of business UUIDs (like contract_uuid = 1234, etc.) that serve as entry points. From there, the idea is to treat the Vault like a graph and traverse it:\nI would use metadatacatalog (link tables, key columns, etc.) to figure out which link tables to scan, and each time I find a new key (e.g. a customer_uuid in a link table), that key gets added to the traversal. The engine keeps running as long as new keys are discovered. Every Iteration would start from the first entry point again (e.g contact_uuid) but with new keys discovered from the previous iteration added. Duplicates key in the iterations will be ignored.\n\nI would build this in PySpark to keep it scalable and flexible. The goal is not to pull raw tables, but rather end up with a list of UUIDs per Hub or Sat that I can use to extract just the data I need from prod into pre prod via a „data exchange layer“. If someone later triggers an new extract for a different business domain, we would only grab new keys no redundant data, no duplicates.\n\nI tried to challenge this approach internally but i felt like it did not lead to a discussion or even „what could go wrong“ scenario.\n\nIn theory, this all makes sense. But I am aware that theory and practice do notalways match , especially when there are thousand of keys, hundreds of tables, and performance becomes an issue.\n\nSo here what I am wondering:\n\nHas anyone built something similar?\nDoes this approach scale?\nAre there proven practice for this that I might be missing?\n\nSo yeah…am i on the right path or run away from this?",

        "content": "We actively use pgvector in a production setting for maintaining and querying HNSW vector indexes used to power our recommendation algorithms. A couple of weeks ago, however, as we were adding many more candidates into our database, we suddenly noticed our query times increasing linearly with the number of profiles, which turned out to be a result of incorrectly structured and overly complicated SQL queries. \n\nTurns out that I hadn't fully internalized how filtering vector queries really worked. I knew vector indexes were fundamentally different from B-trees, hash maps, GIN indexes, etc., but I had not understood that they were essentially incompatible with more standard filtering approaches in the way that they are typically executed. \n\nI searched through google until page 10 and beyond with various different searches, but struggled to find thorough examples addressing the issues I was facing in real production scenarios that I could use to ground my expectations and guide my implementation. \n\nNow, I wrote a blog post about some of the best practices I learned for filtering vector queries using pgvector with PostgreSQL based on all the information I could find, thoroughly tried and tested, and currently in deployed in production use. In it I try to provide:\n\n\\- Reference points to target when optimizing vector queries' performance  \n\\- Clarity about your options for different approaches, such as pre-filtering, post-filtering and integrated filtering with pgvector  \n\\- Examples of optimized query structures using both Python + SQLAlchemy and raw SQL, as well as approaches to dynamically building more complex queries using SQLAlchemy  \n\\- Tips and tricks for constructing both indexes and queries as well as for understanding them  \n\\- Directions for even further optimizations and learning\n\nHopefully it helps, whether you're building standard RAG systems, fully agentic AI applications or good old semantic search! \n\n[https://www.clarvo.ai/blog/optimizing-filtered-vector-queries-from-tens-of-seconds-to-single-digit-milliseconds-in-postgresql](https://www.clarvo.ai/blog/optimizing-filtered-vector-queries-from-tens-of-seconds-to-single-digit-milliseconds-in-postgresql)\n\nLet me know if there is anything I missed or if you have come up with better strategies!",

Initially, I was quite interested in Data Governance, especially given how important compliance and data quality are becoming across the EU with GDPR, AI Act, and other regulations.\n\nI thought this could be a great niche — combining governance, compliance, and maybe even AI/ML-based policy automation in the future.\n\nHowever, after talking to a few professionals in the data engineering field (each with 10+ years of experience), I got a bit of a reality check. They said:\n\nIt’s not easy to break into data governance early in your career.\n\nSmaller companies often don’t take governance seriously or have formal frameworks.\n\nLarger companies do care, but the field is considered too fragile or risky to hand over to someone without deep experience.\n\n\nTheir suggestion was to gain strong hands-on experience in core data roles first — like data engineering or data management — and then transition into data governance once I’ve built a solid foundation and credibility.\n\nThat makes sense logically, but I’m curious what others think.\n\nHas anyone here transitioned into Data Governance later in their career?\n\nHow did you position yourself for it?\n\nAre there any specific skills, certifications, or experiences that helped you make that move?\n\nAnd lastly, do you think the EU’s regulatory environment might create more entry-level or mid-level governance roles in the near future?\n\n\nWould love to hear your experiences or advice.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Other suggestions are also welcome, on the condition they fit the budget of $ 600 - $ 700, but having in mind I speak from Brazil, so in situ suggestions are harder to actually consider. Also, though I'm aiming at DE training because of the immediate context I explained above, suggestions of courses in  related fields (like, if you think I should purchase a Machine Learning course) are also welcome.

I was kind of assuming the values exist on some sort of cartesian plane with XYZ coordinates and from there some sort of maths is done on the inputs to get the output colour, but I'm going to go on a limb here from the responses that is not really whats happening and its more just light/voltage manipulation done by the GPU/image processing part of whatever computer.",

I can't live in the US without income, that would be very hard.\n\nI'm confident about my skills and experience, but I don't think I will be a Senior Developer in the US as I'm in Latin America, here I'm more valuable because I communicate in english plus my technical skills, but in US everyone speaks english, so english is not a valuable skill as it's in here.

Maybe I'm overthinking it? Maybe Type affinities aren't really that important and I could just ignore it? Or should I switch now to a more standard course that uses another database system like MySql?\n\nAdvice?\n\nMy goal is to either get a backend job or a data analyst job.

I don't know how to just free-hand create an HTML site lol. I just used the code that we learned in a project in school and edited to fit my ideas...\n\nI feel like an idiot for that.

I'm not dealing with C pointers, or data storage problems, or even serious optimization issues.

Later, I find a better, more concise, and secure way to solve the issue that I somehow missed when searching.\n\nEach time I publish a repository on GitHub, it only contains the bare essentials for the project and nothing more.\n\nBut also, every time I open other people's repositories or developers' chats, I see people communicating in Elvish, casting unknown secret spells consisting of made-up words and names of tools and libraries, some of which I have never heard of, such as: just, dependabot, pre-commit, uv, unicornus-pam-pam, umdbpegasus, fizzbuzzenterprisemegacooltool, and so on (some of the names are made up, but I think such tools will appear and become a must-have in the next few days).\n\nMany of these pieces of technology can only be discovered by searching for their direct name. However, how can one stumble upon them if they are only searched by name? Furthermore, often, the descriptions of such projects' repositories are as strange as possible and do not reflect their essence. For example, \"FizzBuzzEnterpriseMegaCoolTool is your ambassador to the world of great programming achievements. A framework for delegating fractal powers to transcendent purple entities in the paradigm of the great actor's shift.\" What??? Is this some kind of secret agent's code or is it really Elvish?\n\nAnd this framework itself, for example, is just a tool for generating HTTP clients based on a config. Of course, this example is made up, but I believe you understand what I am trying to say. Most project descriptions are a quiet horror. However, the most interesting thing is that it creates the feeling that everyone around you understands what they are and why they are needed.. And in general, everyone except me, of course, has been using this thing since it first appeared on the internet.\n\nWhen I first started studying, I looked at different roadmaps and study plans. There were lots of popular and useful tools and technologies, like git, Linux, VSCode, and more. Now, nothing has really changed - the basic stuff is still the same.\n\nI find similar roadmaps and look for these magic technologies, but I don't find them. The most you can find them in all sorts of awesome lists, but even then, not all and not always.\n\nOften, these projects have thousands of stars on GitHub, but neither Google nor GitHub search gives me this useful thing - just all the outdated nonsense and users' personal projects.\n\nAnd it happens even more often that such projects have fewer than 500 stars on GitHub, but people still use these things if you look at recent applications or in programmers' chats. How they discovered these things is not clear.\n\nThere is also a common problem that I can't guess up to a certain concept in principle, and because of that, I can't create a search result, because that idea doesn't occur to me. For example, yesterday, I found out about such a thing as harper. I had never even thought of finding tools to check grammar, especially to automate this check in repositories. Or, for instance, hexagonal architecture, which has become popular in recent years (although the concept and original article have been around for many years). I stumbled upon this by accident. If you search for architecture on Google, there will only be MVC, MVP, MVVM and others, not this one. I don't understand how this spreads and why Google's search doesn't reflect actual trends.\n\nI understand that people often learn about concepts and tools through communication and job, rather than searching, but I would still like to know how people initially learn about these things and how they transfer their knowledge. Perhaps I just answered my own question - people simply communicate and interact with each other, sharing information and experiences. Someone may discover something interesting and share it with others, who tell others, and so on. But perhaps I need to hear confirmation of this understanding from you.\n\nIn my attempts to ask these fundamental and interesting questions in chat rooms, but everyone there was toxic about it or ignored it, although, as for me, finding information and learning new things is the most important part of programming. I sometimes feel as if I have been banned from Google and Github search :D. It feels as if my searches are being filtered to exclude useful information and instead provide irrelevant or nonsensical results.\n\nTLDR: I am struggling to find useful new tools, libraries, and concepts in the development community when they are not well indexed by search engines and are mainly distributed through community channels. What important detail of the search for all this am I missing?\n\nI am sorry for the messy and unstructured nature of my text. I am feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I appreciate your help.",

When I look into tech careers, there are so many paths and sub-fields that I don’t even know where to start or how long it would take to become employable.\n\nFor anyone who’s been in this situation — how did you pick a starting point?  \nIs it too late to switch?  \nWhat would you do if you were in my place?\n\nAny advice or direction would help a lot.  \n\n\n**Note:**  \nAfter doing some research, I’m planning to start with the *Google IT Support Professional Certificate*, then move on to the *CompTIA A+*. It seems like a common entry-level path, but I’m still not sure if I’m making the right call — or if there’s a better direction I should be focusing on.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Context: As part of my self-study routine, alongside reading \\*The Algorithm Design Manual\\* by Skiena, I practice LeetCode problems. I’ve also passed a university course on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).\n\nI’m having a hard time recognizing where exactly my lack of skill is and how I should structure my practice. For example, with the LeetCode problem “121 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock\", my initial thought was: “Okay, there’s a profit to be maximized — this seems like a decision problem. When to buy? When to sell? Could it be a greedy problem?” I came up with a “greedy” approach, but it failed on a counterexample. After looking up the solution, I found it could be solved with two pointers and a sliding window — a simple and straightforward method.\n\nWhen I tried to find a dynamic programming solution, I couldn’t locate one (at least on YouTube) that started with a recursive approach and then introduced memoization. From what I remember in my DSA course, we first derived the recursive function as a mathematical definition (not code) and then built a table of values for the dynamic programming implementation. I think my problem is that I understand the general ideas of these concepts:\n\n\\* Backtracking\n\n\\* Dynamic Programming\n\n\\* Memoization\n\nI can also identify the problem category:\n\n\\* Enumeration (find all possible paths or ways)\n\n\\* Optimization (find the maximum or minimum)\n\n\\* Decision (e.g., fractional knapsack problem)\n\nI’m not getting too emotional about it. If I make mistakes, I study other people’s solutions, then move to the next problem with a fresh mind — avoiding overthinking. I walk through examples, see if I can relate them to other problems, patterns, or topics, and try my best. I’d like to hear about your experiences and any advice that helped you overcome similar difficulties. Thanks!",

        "content": "Hello, I'm here to ask a question regarding roadmap organization for a coding project we are working on (a social media one). Keep in mind that preferably we would want a method that isn't blocked behind a paywall, and that we want good habits in terms of organization to form early since we are still teenagers. Also, I'd appreciate it if the UI for the method is easy to understand and intuitive :)  \n  \nCurrently, we have a system on Notion (For reference \\`notion.com/templates/notion-projects-and-tasks\\` ) in which we can a list of tasks and each bunch is separated by a \"project\" which is basically a topic like frontend, backend, note taking, etc. This method is cool, as in it's simple to use and we can very easily add on to each section in their own right. However, this method doesn't have much structure, meaning there's just a bunch of task without any organization of what to do in which order, or any \"branching off\" with tasks in the project that are related to each other. Essentially, it's just a pile of tasks.  \n  \nWhat we want is a roadmap-based system which we branch out into separate categories (UI, Authentication, Communication, etc.) and in each category, we have a linear roadmap which shows each tasks to do in sequence, each task with it's own note or page where we can either add extra mini \"sub-tasks\" to do and comments about our progress and so on and so forth. In such a way where it like creates a pathway of tasks, each task being it's own branch on the tree that connects to others so it gives us a nice flow on what should be done. You know just like standard roadmap but still with great organization, task management and all. At least that's what we invision as being good  \n  \nHaving said that, this is what we are sort of thinking of. But we are young and do not know as much as you other smarter people. So I implore honestly, what would be best? Notion, \\*\\*Clickup, Jira, Asana\\*\\* system and software? We know only so much, being young and inexperienced so whatever I am to say a suggestion probably won't mean too much except perhaps that we would like to have a lot of details and good organization.  \n  \nThat's all!

Idk, I am just kind of lost right now as to how I compare to job market (currently brutal) expectations / other jr developers.\n\nI also have several medium sized projects I have worked on, currently developing a fairly large project, and have done a bit of freelance work. So, I am not leaning on technical knowledge as the only crutch, just curious the significance it really has.",

It makes the learning very concrete and tangible. In that way it's a bit easier to \"keep going\" with it as you learn more.\n\nBut if you're interested in something like how computers work, while it's cool in a mystical sort of sense, or from the perspective of curiosity, it's hard to have a real-world application for it. That lack of real-world application makes it hard to feel like there's goals and a path to follow, and it's easy to feel like you don't have a way to practice what you're learning.\n\nI guess put another way, there's some programming/computer concepts that are inherently practical, and some that feel theoretical. How do you find practical applications for the areas that are more theoretical to reinforce what you're learning?",

This is very bad, because over the years I've built up a library of scripts to automate many aspects of my daily work. So the question is: Which language will take VBS's spot? I know about Powershell, but that seems not so straightforward to learn, plus it's a Windows-only \"language\" (or maybe, set of instructions) which VBS also is, but VBS is \"build off\" VB which is kinda straightforward to learn. I see Java or JavaScript floated, but it seems unclear as of now. This whole thing sucks, but it seems that I'll have to adapt... Thank you.",

I'm a Junior Dev working mainly with Python.\n\nI've been asked to write a series of unit tests for a feature that I'm implementing on a project that I've worked on for a couple of months already.\n\nTo give some context. It's a microservice using a company-developed ORM. Each microservice inherit from a base class with a series of functionalities and the ORM itself. These microservices communicate with each other through a message broker.\n\nI need to write tests mainly for business logic and the ORM-related service layer queries. I’ve never written tests before, so I’ve been reading documentation and watching tutorials but most of the material I find is too basic and not fit for what I need.\n\nI've managed to write most of the tests for the business logic part, but I find it quite hard to do so for the ORM queries.\n\nThe main issue I'm facing is understanding how to effectively test ORM queries. Most examples I see online suggest using mocks with predefined return values, but I don’t really see the value in that.  \nIf I mock everything, I’m basically faking entire functionalities. So if after adding a new feature or refactoring code were to break, these tests would not detect it. So what am I testing?\n\nI feel like I'm testing the same things that I'm writing which doesn't make sense to me.\n\nI'd really appreciate some help on this. Thanks in advance! :)",

You have 2 developers in your team, 1 of them is autistic, the other one is naturally gifted and hates retards ( yes the interviewer actually said this word ), the autistic developer has to present his work and the other developer is intentionally asking difficult questions to flex his intellectual.\n\nHow would you handle this?\n\n????? WHAT?\n\nAnother time I did a system design interview, 2 interviewers asked me a very simple question, how would I do pagination... This was for a very popular payment company.\n\nInstead of asking me whether to use cursor-based or off-set pagination or how to implement it all, they asked me \"**why is it called pagination and where did this term originate from?**\"\n\nI couldn't answer and they just told me \"**okay, it seems like you're struggling hard, let's just move on to pair programming.

Honestly, the combination of remote work and alcoholism destroyed my mental health that by the time i received that fateful calendar invite, i was relieved. I didn’t have to do it anymore. I got an okay severance but used that and my unemployment to keep me afloat and not homeless for ~6 months. I quit drinking at that time and interviewed for a few jobs.\n\nAfter two final rounds for a couple jobs and not getting it both times, i’ve basically been frozen. I can’t do the interviews, i can barely even bring myself to apply anymore. I thought it would be easier being sober but it’s like my subconscious is trying to sabotage me because of how truly awful it was in those final months of employment. Here i am, 2 years later, and i’m not even sure if it’s possible for me to get a job anymore when i’ve got a two year gap. \n\nI’m borderline homeless, staying with family, and i’m kind of sick of it. Delivering uber eats destroyed my car in this time that i literally just cashed out my old 401k, the absolute last of my savings. I have tried camming as well with my girlfriend, since i’m a gay lady with an unreasonably hot girlfriend despite the life circumstances. It was great money but it’s so mentally exhausting, something i seemingly have no capacity for anymore.\n\nI haven’t posted in this sub since 2016/17 when i was a new grad and well, i honestly just want to feel like someone else understands my struggle. I feel like a failure and literally don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I had wanted this career since i was a child. What do you do when your dream job eviscerates your mental health? I know i need therapy but there’s no way a broke ass bitch can just afford that when i can’t even afford rent.\n\nI’ll probably delete this or maybe it’ll get moderated for not fitting the sub, but y’all, if anyone reads this, thank you for listening.\n",

        "author": "guineverefira",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m about six months into my first full-time software engineering job at Apple, and I constantly feel like an imposter. I still don’t fully understand what’s being discussed in stand-up sometimes — people talk about complex systems and dependencies like it’s second nature, and I just nod along feeling lost.\nI also find myself relying on AI to generate a lot of my code. It’s something that’s actually encouraged here, but part of me worries it’s making me dependent. I do try to read and understand what it’s doing afterward, but I still feel like I’m just barely keeping up. Without it, though, I honestly think I’d be completely lost and wouldn’t finish half of what I need to do.\n\nFor example, right now I’m doing some performance testing — running network tests, analyzing latency, and comparing different protocols — and it’s been going on for a while. I just keep feeling like I’m missing something or not doing it the “right” way. Part of me wonders if someone else had this task instead of me, it would’ve been done by now.\n\nI also feel like I’m getting things done, but not really understanding them. I can complete the tasks, but idk if i’m even doing them well and I wish I truly understood how and why everything works the way it does — the underlying architecture, the reasoning, the “why” behind each step. It makes me feel like I’m just going through the motions rather than growing as an engineer.\n\nLately I’ve also been feeling kind of dumb — not in a self-deprecating way, but genuinely wondering if maybe my brain just doesn’t think the way a CS brain should. Like, maybe I’m not smart enough for this kind of work. I see how effortlessly some people grasp things like system architecture or debugging complex issues, and I feel like I’m missing whatever “clicks” for them.\n\nWhat really gets to me is hearing how confidently everyone else speaks — about QE, testing flows, deployment, architecture, tokens, etc etc  — and I just… don’t feel like I understand the bigger picture. I can get individual tasks done, but I don’t yet “get” how all the pieces fit together in a large-scale system.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? How do you actually learn to think like a real engineer and not just a task-doer? How do I become that person who genuinely knows what they’re doing and speaks knowledgeably and doesn’t just pray to somehow make it through the day without being confused out of my mind? Is this normal? Are there courses, books, or resources that helped you connect the dots and understand the bigger picture of how software systems work in practice?\n\nAny advice would mean a lot.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So for some context, I would not consider myself old school by any means. I started learning to code with Java back in 2017, so I learned to code \"the old-fashioned way\" by looking at documentation and/or stack overflow before AI came into the mainstream.\n\nI now work in test automation primarily using C#, but I also have quite a bit of experience with Python as well. I now use Copilot in my daily workflow, but I genuinely do not understand how you guys are saying things like \"My workflow is 95% prompting then copy and pasting and I barely ever touch code manually now.\" My experience with copilot is that it will make up functions left and right that do not exist in the codebase, and it's actually faster for me to just write the code manually and then use AI as sort of a glorified stack overflow. I.e. I can rubber duck with it, and it won't call me stupid for asking a question. I'm genuinely confused how people are vibe coding entire applications.\n\nWhen you guys do this is the code actually robust and work well? Or do you end up spending a lot of time refactoring? Do you spend a lot of time coming up with instructions for the AI? What are the strategies you guys use to make it effective for you? In my experience it seems to be good at things like leetcode, but bad in large codebases with dependencies and structure.\n\nEdit: From these responses it seems like most of you use AI basically the same way I do, with the exception of the cursor comments. Unfortunately I’m in a corporation so switching to cursor and trying it out isn’t really feasible for me in this context. Maybe I’ll give it a try on my own and see how it does for a side project. ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm an ML Engineer with 6 YoE and a PhD for ML in Applied Math, based in the US. I started a new job in January at a large company with 18 days of PTO, which I thought was nice considering I'm used to \"unlimited\" which left me constantly worried about what was ok to take.\n\nFor the first few months, I didn't request any time as I know it can be considered unprofessional when you're new. I took a single day because I had to move for the job, which my manager didn't seem happy about, but it was a big move from a place I had lived in for a long time and I made it clear I was going to need to before I was even offered the job.\n\nJust for some background, over the year my manager's feedback has been very negative. Whenever I get this negative feedback I put in extra effort to address it, and at first I figured he was just a bit more demanding than most. But as I'm now grinding over the weekends and occasionally pulling all-nighters, I see that my manager is just looking for anything to critique and ignoring everything else. It's not like I'm just not doing the work or half-assing it, in fact I've gone above and beyond to meet every critique, no matter how minor, and I've tried to pull out all the stops on clever solutions and building out important features. I've even had other coworkers remark at the amount I've accomplished and the quality of the results, so I don't think it's just in my head. My team is also sort of \"R&D\" for a large company, so our results are important, but we don't have rush times or fast-paced deadlines.\n\nBut whenever I've put in PTO requests, he has denied them, saying I'm too behind to be taking extra time off. I put in the requests at least 2 months in advance, and I'm not requesting much -- when I had \"unlimited\" PTO I never took more than 5 days total in a year so I'm not looking to take off an entire week or anything. Honestly I just want to use the time since it goes away at the end of the year and doesn't pay out or roll over. He and other members of my team seem to take long vacations all the time though, so I'm not sure why it's just me that can't take any days of PTO.\n\nEveryone I've talked to so far has basically said that it's ultimately my manager's discretion, which surprised me as I thought dedicated PTO totals meant there was some sort of legal requirement that you be allowed to use them. I guess lesson learned now.\n\nAny advice though? Simply leaving for another job is difficult considering it's not even been a year, and my previous roles have been 1-2 years as well so I was looking to have a long stint at one place to make it not look so bad. Beyond that, if anyone has experience with this I'd like to hear about it so I can understand what to do / not to do.",

I’m not happy about the switch, mainly because my goal is to get to grad school —> work in industry research. But I can’t stomach pseudo unemployment anymore.\n\nThe new place develops agentic solutions for some really big government clients. Cool so far. The pay is good and the environment is semi flexible and more dynamic and fast paced than the lab. All fine and dandy.\n\nHowever, the structure of the work is pretty chaotic. And it’s especially subject to client expectations, which…. I mean— i feel like a country bum for making this observation— are ludicrous and verging on offensive. 3 weeks to develop a fully functional system? It seems insane. \n\nI’m trying to deliver fast, but the only way to iterate fast is to vibe code and frankly it’s a mind numbing exercise. I’m assessing the potential damage on my learning trajectory and well… i dunno. I feel like I’m just reinforcing my fraud status. \n\nI know that this is a stupid gripe to have especially when i’m lucky to even have a job. And I don’t have any other worthwhile experiences to benchmark against since the research lab was an atrocious place on all facets (garbage PI, no contract, no benefits, slow progress) except for the publication potential and the exposure to academic connections and really really intelligent people (who also happen to be horrible human beings).\n\n",

After I dropped out of school I did a lot of traveling and worked mostly hospitality jobs which I’ve enjoyed for the most part. I just don’t know if I see myself working hospitality in the long run. Thus, I’ve gone back to school to give it another chance with the hopes to make good/decent money post-grad. I’m currently taking an intro to programming/scripting class which has been going ok, the thing is I’m just not sure if I love it yet. My true passion is travel, and I figured if I studied CS I could get a well paying job and potentially be able to work remotely whilst traveling in the future. But now I’m really second guessing everything considering how poor the job market for CS grads seem to be at the moment. So, am I making a mistake for continuing this path? Should I consider studying something else, or even just drop out again and see where life takes me? I’m also currently living with my parents and hate the state I live in (US), so the thought of being stuck here for another 3-4 years sounds miserable, but if I could set myself up for a good future I feel it’d be worth it.

        "author": "PentaSector",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey all. Apologies for the long post. Mainly want to be thorough to emphasize the efforts I've made and the scope of the problem.\n\nSo, I manage a small squad of devs on a larger project team and maintain a full-time dev workload alongside them. (I know what you're thinking, and you're right, but I've accepted the challenge for the sake of my trajectory.)\n\nThis is my first managerial role; I was deliberately given less advanced devs, partly to mentor them and help boost their professional development, partly to shield them from aggressive technical leadership. I was fine with that assignment; it plays to my strengths as a mentor and safe space steward. I do what I can to foster collaboration and self-organization - we have\n\n* a chat channel just for my reports and me (i.e., a space to screen \"stupid\" questions before asking the wider team, etc.)\n* regular meetings to check up on work status and collaborate on blockers in real time\n* 1:1 and 1:few meetings to get people comfortable and talking through obstacles\n* me frequently working to communicate thought process to the team through detailed code reviews, driving on pair/group programming sessions, and brainstorming out loud during aforementioned meetings\n\nBasically, I'm doing everything I can to not only get people working together, but also to make sure they see the work through my eyes as much as I can verbalize my process.\n\nI'm confident in asserting that I'm putting forth disproportionate effort in getting them somewhere closer to my level. My efficiency suffers for it, but leadership is generally happy with my velocity, and I'm still significantly more efficient than the rest of the team. Some of them are legitimately junior and gradually ramping up, but a few have more YoE than I do and frequently submit incomplete, incorrect, or arguably badly engineered solutions (acknowledging that the latter is somewhat subject to my opinions, but it's also the least of my worries). This manifests in incredibly frustrating ways, like having to talk through the same technical guidance or arguments repeatedly as people continue to make the exact same mistakes, and having to frequently repeat what strikes me as obvious advice to solve refactoring or bugfixing problems (e.g., if you're trying to correlate a code path to a navigation path within a web app, start with a known related unit of code and follow the references). Tl;dr: lack of curiosity seems to be a major factor.\n\nThese are the kinds of problems that resulted in me being stepped up to manage these devs, and the lack of improvement is felt across the wider team. This manifests pretty clearly in the fact that we estimate our own roadmap and have decent leeway to do so, and the devs aren't even meeting their own numbers when they get the padding they argue for. We're essentially not at liberty to stretch our roadmap much further, just given the dependencies on our output, so when we fall behind on our own estimates, it's a problem, and people come under scrutiny.\n\nI was recently asked to pull the tech lead into one of our regular meetings - one where mob coding is a frequent engagement - to help gauge the situation. After sitting in on a few rounds, his assessment was that I'm doing enough of the work that they ultimately have no need to be curious when I drive, and he's right. Anytime the devs pull me aside, it turns into me taking the cockpit and talking through how I work; I always let them start, but I usually take over *because* they essentially hit a point where they're just lost or out of ideas, including in the context of obstacles we've specifically worked through before.\n\nHis proposed solution was to start letting them fail immediately. There's a version of this that I can get on with, but this work environment is not particularly tolerant of the kind of \"failure\" it would entail, and I don't want to put anybody's job at risk.\n\nSo my question is essentially this:\n\n**What's a graduated approach I can take to get people working more independently that gives willing devs a chance and respects my time?**\n\nI don't foresee something like purposely tracking my collab hours and tuning them down each week; that'll never hold up. I *have* contemplated cutting all collab hours and letting code review be our only touchpoint. The problem here is that several devs don't seem to internalize review feedback, and PR churn sometimes results in exponential loss of time. E.g., they may submit a PR after one day but take two more to fix relatively simple issues. I'm essentially looking for a way to provide detailed, immediate feedback that they *will* internalize, while keeping my time burden for that sort of effort stable and eventually decreasing.\n\nMoreover, **what's a way to do this that doesn't leave people feeling demoralized or traumatized?** I'm clearly frustrated, but these are still people, and I don't want to make their lives hard. I just want to see them perform to their potential.\n\nOpen to any insights regarding successful approaches that folks have taken here to empower and motivate their teams, especially if starting from a place of subpar performance.\n\nAlso feel free to ask clarifying questions or hurl clarifying insults; there's surely a lot of context I'm leaving out here, probably in part just because I'm fixating on solving the problem more than thinking broadly around it.\n\n**EDIT:** remove a rogue instance of the word \"I'm.\"",

Last summer, I accepted an internship at  a non-tech company working as a full stack intern. The company is great, people are nice, pay for my area is pretty good, etc. I was offered to continue my internship part time through the school year and have continued working there ever since. Apparently, it is rare for them to extend such an offer, and the full timers on my team tell me that I will most likely be offered a job upon graduation. I do not ever put my eggs in one basket, ESPECIALLY on the foundation of “most likely”. So, last school year after accepting the internship I applied for my Masters in CS with an emphasis in ML. I was accepted into the program, but now I am having doubts given the current job market. My plan was to find a data science internship and try to transition into ML after getting my masters, but I keep getting rejected. Now, I am at a cross roads between pursuing SWE, where  I have experience, or keep pursuing my passion of ML. \n\nSide note: I am more interested in Computer Vision, where i currently have a research assistant position. I understand that this likely requires a PhD, but I am also open to more traditional ML roles. ",

It honestly feels like a hackathon.\n\nI’m trying to understand the system logic and learn SnapLogic at the same time. I’m making progress, but I’m frustrated. Yesterday I found a bug and figured out the root cause and fix in minutes — but then spent the entire day figuring out how to implement it in SnapLogic. Tried docs, AI tools, trial-and-error… nothing. Finally got help from a SnapLogic dev in another team and he solved it in 15 minutes.\n\nOn top of that, this feels like a career-direction issue too. My manager is changing soon, which means I’ll likely be stuck owning this SnapLogic project long-term. Once it goes to production it’ll mostly just be maintenance and I don’t want to get pigeonholed into this. I want to stay focused on backend Java projects, not get boxed into ETL work I’m not excited about.\n\nHow do you handle situations where you get assigned to a project you’re really not interested in and don’t want to end up tied to long-term?

        "content": "I (32M; Singapore) feel as though I've hit a wall in my current role. I have 7 YoE of Web Development (4 in my current) and I'm not learning the things I want to learn, or seeing progress in terms of promotions and title-growth. The culture has also degraded after the company I joined was merged into another (I joined a bank in end-2021 that collapsed in 2023), and a lot of the original, interesting people I thought I could learn from has left for other companies or moved onto other internal positions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFor context, my Project is some back-office data aggregator that ingests data from different sources and exposes it to downstream middle-office and front-office applications via REST API and Elasticsearch. This sounds ok, until you realize that we don't get any credit for the accomplishments of the downstream applications (which Business people can relate to), whilst still taking the heat for when the data is not what they expect it to be (i.e. we effectively just redistribute our upstream data under this new company). My daily work now involves more firefighting rather than technically challenging and inspiring tasks, and my Team Lead and I are the only ones in the Team that handles the firefighting, the rest don't.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nTo be fair to this Project, every year since joining I learnt something technically \"interesting\".\n> * 1st year (2022) was an introduction to Backend Work and Technologies - learning how to use Mongo and Kotlin, writing proper Unit and E2E Tests (my previous companies didn't mandate tests, relying instead on a QA Dept to ensure correctness).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> * 2nd year (2023) was tying all that I've learnt thus far into making a Full-Stack Project from the ground up - creating a Gradle Task for putting the Frontend Client-Side Bundle into the Resources Folder of the Kotlin Project and serving that, using the Quarkus framework instead of http4k, GitLab CICD Pipelines, integrating Sonarqube for both Javascript and Kotlin Source Code, using Kaniko to create a new Application Image and using Helm Charts to configure and run the Application Image onto Openshift. This new Project would have been important, to quote my former Line Manager, had my company not collapsed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> * 3rd year (2024) was trying to replace our former f5 / haproxy certficate-based authentication with OAuth2 / OIDC on a company centralized IDP. Supposedly this was required so that systems from the new company could access systems hosted within the old company's network. I managed to integrate OIDC on our Dev env for our UI, until it was suddenly no longer needed; someone high up pushed for something so that many Projects didn't have to individually change for this. And so many weeks of Dev work went down the drain.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>* 4th year (2025) involved shifting our Project to be hosted on Azure Cloud services. For my part, I had to replace our old FTP Servers (we receive data in files and process them in batches) to the Azure-equivalent - Azure Blob Storage connected to an Event Grid which sends Blob Creation Events to our Event Hub, and change the Project Code to listen for those via a Kafka Interface. This should have been interesting to me, but it just felt meh. Probably because the new company had an in-house abstraction layer over the ARM / Bicep Templates via Ansible Roles - I think I would have liked it more if I dealt directly with Azure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThere were other tasks in the background that I felt were mildly interesting too - writing code to process large text files in parallel (using nio for the Random Access and Kotlin IO Coroutines) for data analysis being one.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI did try to go for a few interviews but I think the main problem is that my experience is not in demand - my Project is primarily written in Kotlin and http4k, and that greatly limits the search because the closest equivalent that is more popular is Java and Spring / Springboot and in this market hiring managers can pick other candidates that have the exact skillset that they are looking for rather than having to settle for candidates with adjacent skills. I used to do Frontend with React, but that was over a year ago since the UI of the project has been descoped. I feel like even if I dedicate time to learning Java and Spring / Springboot, hiring managers would just choose candidates with direct hands-on professional experience instead of experience with side projects, or pick fresh graduates instead. Probably another issue is that I can't recite my experience like how I did above on demand / in real-time - my verbal communication skills are lacking.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt just feels very, very difficult motivationally to dedicate free time outside of work to get myself into a better position - like I _really_ don't want to spend even more of my waking time outside of work having to work for something that might not even pay off. I know staying in this role will probably eventually end my career, but it's like, what's the point? The market is horrible and AI is somehow _still_ the reason mass-layoffs are happening even though I see endless chatter on Reddit that it's not all that it's cracked up to be. Honestly, it feels like I'm just waiting for the music to stop and get laid off - at least I then have an excuse to take a break.",

Working as software engineer for a defense contractor and been here 3 years. For the people in a similar company you will know it is semi laid back as things are allowed to move slow but the work can be challenging at times.\n\nHeres my dilemma.. I feel like I should be somewhere else making way more money. I think my talent is going to waste here working on 30 year old C++ code. Multiple coworkers have told me not to stay too long or you will have no option in the future. Feeling a bit down. The pro about the job is that it is very secure, almost recession proof. It’s just that it’s starting to feel like im not doing the best I can in my career. I’m about to be 27 and I feel like it’s now or never. Really want to work as an engineer for hedge fund or something to do with trading and quantitative stuff. My company will pay for my masters but that means staying there another 3-4 years. Am I just tired of the repetitiveness? Lately I’ve been thinking it would be the same anywhere I go. I find myself as somebody who wants to get better everyday but this new stage in life seems like I reached a pinnacle. Anybody ever feel the same way? I see people here grinding for jobs and complaining they can’t get one so maybe I’m just ungrateful. \n\nTL;DR feeling like I’m not doing enough despite having a decent job. Looking for something to change in my career but also feel that this is as good as it can get. Anybody been a similar situation? Any words of encouragement or advice? ",

That turned into an offer for 80k, unlimited PTO (2 weeks minimum), fully remote.\n\nThe pay is on the lower side ofc but I am very happy to have a job waiting for me after I graduate. Plus since it is remote, I can live with my parents for now and build up some savings etc.\n\nI guess my question is what can I do now to lead me to a jump to a FAANG company in a couple years?

Also want to make sure I keep working on my leetcode skills even though I have a job, and start studying system design.",

We first were looking for candidates who know the tech stack. We got bunch of resumes from the consulting companies that mentioned they have worked on the tech stack, and they all have at least 7+ years of experience ( in general), but literally none of them passed our two round interview. \n\nThe first one is questions about some basic knowledge ( basic if you've worked on the tech stack, in my opinion ), and questions about how the candidates would solve a problem.\n\nThe second round is a coding challenge while sharing the screen (like pair programming where we might give some hints) that only takes about 90 mins. The features we asked them to do are really basic if they have worked on the tech stack before, and we also allowed them to google and check the documentation if they want, it really is an open book exam, but just no AI stuff. 90 mins is really more than enough to complete.\n\nNone of them passed. We decided to look for candidates who know a different tech stack that I think is more well known compared to the first one, but also to focus on how they solve problems, like the approach they take, how they are solving it, and etc. Guess what, literally only 2 of them passed and they aren't really the devs we are looking for, we only hired them because we realized they know a tech stack well enough and seems to be alright when it comes to learning new things.\n\nWe have interviewed more than 40 people already.

Hiring freeze, no promotions, no roadmaps, and no opportunities for internal transfers since all open positions are now based in India. The general sentiment is that there’s little interest in the products my org develops and that we're considered too expensive, so our situation isn’t looking good. While the budget for next year is already allocated, there’s a real risk of layoffs starting in 2026.\n\nI’ve started exploring new opportunities, for fully remote roles. I mostly find openings at startups. European big tech have largely stopped offering full remote positions and are basically in hiring freeze, so the available roles are few and highly competitive. That said, I’m able to compete for positions at established startups, typically Series B or later, since I avoid earlier-stage ones due to the higher risk.\n\nMy dilemma is this: should I stay where I am, stagnant and without growth prospects, but hoping the rumors turn out to be wrong and my division gets a second chance? And in the meantime, maybe hope for a lucky break with an interview at another big tech? startup? Does it make sense to leave a big tech for the risk of being without work in two years for a startup that I imagine could fail anyway in the same timeframe?",

        "content": "just coming on here to vent, i guess. \n\ni was hired for a contract to hire position through a recruiter for a major media company in mid august. i've basically been told that this job is \"guaranteed\" once the contract period ends, but i'm taking that with a massive grain of salt and assuming this \"guarantee\" isn't really a guarantee. i've never held a tech job prior to this one, my background is in healthcare and i graduated with a degree in IT in december 2024. \n\ni've always considered myself a high performer, i don't like to cut corners, i have this primal need to be thorough in everything that i do and like i must understand, inside and out, the code that i'm writing. if i can't explain why i wrote this the way i did, what am i doing?\n\ni completed onboarding probably end of august and since then, i think i've probably *actually* merged maybe 5 tickets. also, since i've been hired, the company i work for has brought on another junior engineer just last week and i started at the same time as another junior engineer. just from talking to the other juniors, it has become painfully evident to me that i am a personality hire. and that's fine! whatever gets you the job, right?? \n\ni believe i had, essentially 3 behavioral interviews, and 1 technical interview whereas the other juniors had upwards of 2-3 technical screens. i do also want to mention that my job primarily revolves around vanilla javascript, which i was never proficient in. before my technical interview, i probably crammed all the basics of javascript in < 1 week bc i'd been spending almost 100% of my time using python with the assumption that technical screens would be language agnostic. that was not the case for this interview.\n\ni know it's par for the course for juniors to feel \"slow\" or \"behind\", it truly does feel like drinking from a fire hose in terms of understanding wtf is going on before i even think about writing a solution for the ticket i'm working on. 90% of my time spent is just understanding what others have written, how to work with it, etc. i've never touched unit testing in jest prior to this role and now i'm responsible for writing unit tests with 95% coverage for every ticket i write - literally everything is brand spanking new to me lmfao \n\nand, ofc, i also know that juniors are certainly not expected to contribute *meaningfully* probably for the first year or so. but, at the same time, if it's taking me 1 month to work on a 3 point ticket, i cannot help but feel out of my depth and like i don't deserve to be in the position i'm in. \n\ni ask questions when i need to, i ask to be part of meetings/ask if i can sit in on discussions revolving technology i have zero exposure to (hello datadog & synthetics testing!!!!), i'm chatty and maybe even too responsive on slack, i participate in outings, all that shit.\n\nam i crazy to feel like they hired the wrong person for this job?? at the end of the day, i was hired to do a job and i feel like i'm not doing that job. my engineering manager tells me everyone on the team loves me, blah blah blah, but he would \"love\" to see me \"pick up more tickets\". \n\nidk gang, am i letting imposter syndrome get the better of me? \n\ntia :''')",

We’re a small startup, so official roles are flexible, but the opportunities are starting to open up - and now I’m stuck between two paths: Technical Product Management or Backend Development.\n\n**My background:**\n\n* Currently a CX Specialist Level 3 (promoted twice)\n* No formal CS degree, but I’ve built a few Python tools and scripts\n* Work closely with our Senior PM and engineering team\n\n**Path 1: Technical Product Management**\n\n* I’ve been shadowing and collaborating with our Senior PM for over a year\n* Used my learning stipend to take a semester-long PM foundations course\n* I’ve written PRDs, participated in spikes, backlog grooming, and customer research\n* Haven’t fully owned an end-to-end product cycle yet\n\n**Path 2: Backend Development**\n\n* Mostly self-taught\n* Helped customers onboard using a Python import tool our dev team made - ended up saving dev time and even got public recognition for it\n* I have a personal project in Python that I'm working on right now, and if I hit pay dirt, it'll be a big step towards moving into Backend\n* I really enjoy the logic/problem-solving side of engineering\n\n**Other context:**\n\n* I’m already comfortable poking around backend tools like Kibana, Datomic, and JSON APIs when needed\n* Our company currently needs more backend developers, especially with a new AI product in development\n* Backend feels like it has a clearer career ladder (EM, Architect, DevOps, etc.)\n* I’m less sure what the long-term growth of a Technical PM looks like at a smaller startup\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nMid-level CX employee at a startup deciding between moving into Technical Product Management or Backend Development. I like both, but Backend feels more interesting, in-demand, and scalable long-term. PM aligns better with my current relationships and experience, but the growth path feels less defined.\n\n**If you were in my position, which path would you choose - and why?**",

I guess I always just assumed design is for naturally creative people who have an interest in that stuff.\n* In mid 40s now, and gone back into a fulltime job as fullstack dev recently, but not enjoying it after being so used to having my freedom most of my career.\n* I like working on my own big complex solo projects, but not working on big shared codebases and/or in teams.\n  * I've got ADHD, which is a big differentiator here... no problem cranking 30 hours on my own projects, but staying motivated & focused on team projects is very hard... I'm constantly \"whinging/arguing in my head\" about things I don't like in the codebase, which I know is unproductive, but I can't help it.\n* I'm considering going back to being self-employed, and maybe learning to design sites myself, so I can do everything myself, rather than being more limited to backend dev, and relying also not relying on wordpress themes for the design side.\n* Wondering if anyone else had made this kind of change?  i.e. more techie-minded people who weren't interested in design (or even frontend) for a long time, but went and learnt it anyway to run their own small webdev agencies?\n  * Typically I've taken on these small site jobs, and just throw together in Wordpress (not a fan)... mainly because of the themes available (seeing I'm not a designer)... my theory here is that I'd instead build something closer to static sites with React (stack that I like), and learn the design side so I can at least design pretty standard brochureware business sites for clients.\n  * None of my clients that I've built wordpress sites for ever actually use the control panel to edit stuff themselves (and I hate having to edit stuff in wordpress for them), so I'm thinking of just charging a bit more for the hosting, and including updates in those ongoing fees.\n* I don't mind dealing with clients and all that \"soft skills\" side of business, chasing invoices etc... plenty of experience with it mostly being self-employed... and much prefer handling that myself than dealing with vague requirements passed through communication-by-proxy in bigger companies.\n  * What I'm seeking advice/anecdotes about here is more just the \"learning to design\" side for anyone with a similar techie background.  ... how feasible is it?  Pros/cons of change in tech complexity vs being more responsible for creative design etc.",

Years later, I went back to school, got a second bachelor’s in CS Online from OSU about 4 years ago, and going to finish my OMSCS from Georgia Tech this fall.

My concern is that listing that first degree I earned 15 years ago might make me look older compared to my experience level (3 YOE), which could create some bias...

        "title": "Should I avoid small companies as a fresh grad? Or do I just have a bad misunderstanding of how small companies operate?",
        "author": "ThatEmoSprite",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "(SEA-based) I don't mean to sound very naive, or totally exclude all small companies from my job search, but I'm sensing that a lot of small companies don't have very optimized workflows or good programming practices. Even though I'm admittedly not very good at programming, I don't want to be stuck learning bad habits immediately out of school.  \n  \nThe reason for me asking is because I have a very limited grasp on how real-world companies function. The only experience I have is from my internship, where we didn't even have things like tickets, code reviews, or tests. They also often hire interns to do the bulk of their work.   \n  \nI did frontend and we'd sometimes hardcode stuff into our codebase, sometimes at the suggestion of my supervisor who has 1 year of work experience (sometimes it was inevitable because of how messed up the codebase was). I'd dread going to work only to know that I'd be stuck writing code like that for years.\n\nReviews on glassdoor for other small-sized companies in my area also seem to be similar with similar practices: disorganized management and workflows, overly dependant on interns, no documentation, etc. Am I disillusioned by reality because of my lack of experience? Or do I just need to search for more stable and established companies?",
