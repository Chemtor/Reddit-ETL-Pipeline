        "content": "[This came to my attention in this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k1pl3y/a_databricks_project_a_tight_deadline_and_a_pip/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) One of \\*the big things\\* that separates a data analyst from a data engineer, imo, is whether or not you're capable of testing your code. There's a lot of learners around here right now so I'm going to write this for your benefit. I hope it helps!\n\n# Caveat\n\nI am not a data engineer. I am a PM for data systems, was a data analyst in my previous life, and have worked with some very good senior contributors and architects. I've learned a lot from them and owe a lot of my career success to their lessons.\n\nI am going to try to pass on the little that I know. If you know better than I do, pop into the comments below and feel free to yell at me.\n\nAlso, testing is a wide, varied field, this is a brief synopsis, definitely do more reading on your own.\n\n# When do I need to test my code?\n\nData transformations happen in a lot of different ways. When you work with small data, you might write an excel macro, or a quick little script for manipulation. Not writing tests for these is largely fine, especially when it's something **you** do just for **your** work. Coding in isolation can benefit from tests, but it's not the primary concern.\n\nYou really need to start thinking about writing tests when two things happen:\n\n1. People that are not you start touching your code\n2. The code you write becomes part of a complex system\n\nThe exception to these two rules is when you're creating portfolio projects. You should write tests for these, because they make you look smart to your interviewers.\n\n# Why do I need to test my code?\n\nTests take **implicit** knowledge & context about the purpose of your code / what it does and makes that knowledge **explicit**.\n\nThis is required to help other people start using the code that you write - if they're new to it, the tests help them understand the purpose of each function and give them guard rails as they make changes.\n\nWhen your code becomes incorporated into a larger system, this is particularly true - it's more likely you'll have multiple folks working with you, and other things that are happening elsewhere in the system might necessitate making changes to your code.\n\n# What types of tests are there?\n\nI can name at least 4 different types of tests off the dome. There are more but I'm typing extemporaneously and not for clout, so you get what's in my memory:\n\n* Unit tests - these test small, discrete parts of your code.\n   * Example: in your pipeline, you write a small function that lowercases names and strips certain characters. You need this to work in a predictable manner, so you write a unit test for it.\n* Integration tests - these test the boundaries between different functions to make sure the output of one feeds the input of the other correctly.\n   * Example: in your pipeline, one function extracts the data from an API, and another takes that extracted data and does a transform. An integration test would examine whether the output of the first function results is correct for the second.\n* End-to-end tests - these test whether, given a correct input, the whole of your code produces the correct output. These are hard, but the more of these you can do, the better off you'll be.\n   * Example: you have a pipeline that reads data from an API and inserts it into your database. You mock out a fake input and run your whole pipeline against it, then verify that the expected output is in the database.\n* Data validation tests - these test whether the data you're being passed, or the data that's landing in a given system, are of the expected shape and type.\n   * Example: your pipeline expects a json blob that has strings in it. Data validation tests would ensure that, once extracted or placed in a holding area, the data is both a json blob with the correct keys and the data types for those keys are all strings\n\n# How do I write tests?\n\nThis is already getting longer than I have patience for, it's Friday at 4pm, so again, you're going to get some crib notes.\n\nWhatever language you're using should have some kind of built-in testing capability. SQL does not, unfortunately - it's why you tend to wrap SQL in a different programming language like Python. If you only have SQL, some of what I write below won't apply - you're most likely only doing end-to-end or data validation testing.\n\nStart by writing functional tests. For each function in your code, write at least one positive case (where it gets the correct input) and one negative case (where it's given a bad input that might break it).\n\nTry to anticipate ways in which your functions might fail. Encode those into your test cases. If you encounter new and exciting ways in which your code breaks as you work, write more tests for those cases.\n\nYour development process should become an endless litany of writing code, then writing tests, then testing, then breaking, then writing more tests, then writing more code, and so on in an endless loop.\n\nOnce you've got a whole pipeline running, write integration tests for the handoffs between your functions. Same thing applies as above. You might need to do some mocking - look that up. \n\nEnd-to-end tests - you might need more complex testing techniques for this, or frameworks. If you have a webapp over your data, you can try something like Selenium. Otherwise, not my forte, consult your seniors. You might also need to set up a test environment with some test data. It's expensive time-wise, but this is why we write infrastructure as code (learn that also, if you can).\n\nData validation tests - if you're writing in SQL, use DBT. If you're writing in Python, use Great Expectations. If you're writing in something else, I can't help you, not my forte, consult your seniors.\n\nHappy Friday folks, hope this helped!\n\nTagging u/Recent-Luck-6238, u/FloLeicester, and u/givnv since you all asked!",

While many technical blogs provide general recommendations across different sources with varying complexity, they often lack specific solutions or long-term approaches and techniques that show how to deal with these challenges on a daily basis in production. In this series, I aim to fill that gap by presenting **real-world examples with concrete techniques and practices**.\n\nDrawing from my experience with well-known titans in the automotive industry, I’ll discuss **large-scale production challenges** in projects reliant on these sources. This includes:\n\n* **Handling page structure changes**\n* **Avoiding IP bans**\n* **Overcoming anti-spam measures**\n* **Addressing fingerprinting**\n* **Staying undetected / Hiding scraping behavior**\n* **Maximizing data coverage**\n* **Mapping reference data across sources**\n* **Implementing monitoring and alerting systems**\n\nAdditionally, I will cover the **legal challenges and considerations related to data scraping**.\n\n# About the project\n\nThe project is a **web-based distributed microservice system aggregator** designed to gather car offers from the most popular sources across CIS and European countries. This system is built for advanced analytics to address critical questions in the automotive market, including:\n\n* **Determining the most profitable way and path to buy a car** at the current moment, considering currency exchange rates, global market conditions, and other relevant factors.\n* **Assessing whether it is more advantageous to purchase a car from another country** or within the internal market.\n* **Estimating the average time it takes to sell a specific car model** in a particular country.\n* **Identifying trends in car prices across different regions.**\n* **Understanding how economic and political changes impact car sales and prices.**\n\nThe system maintains and updates a database of around **1 million actual car listings** and stores historical data since **2022**. **In total, it holds over 10 million car listings**, enabling comprehensive data collection and detailed analysis. This extensive dataset helps users make informed decisions in the automotive market by providing valuable insights and trends.\n\n# High-level architecture overview\n\n[Link to drawio ](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=large-scale-arhictecture.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1H01J4TnB47yhofRdUE3gmuJptIuSmHga%26export%3Ddownload#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22FqT4bm1NmBD6wpKYtjI3%22%7D)\n\n**Microservices**: The system is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for specific tasks such as data listing, storage, and analytics. This modular approach ensures that each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. The key microservices include:\n\n* **Cars Microservice**: Handles the collection, storage, and updating of car listings from various sources.\n* **Subscribers Microservice**: Manages user subscriptions and notifications, ensuring users are informed of updates and relevant analytics.\n* **Analytics Microservice**: Processes the collected data to generate insights and answer key questions about the automotive market.\n* **Gateway Microservice**: Acts as the entry point for all incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices while managing authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.\n\n**Data Scrapers**: Distributed scrapers are deployed to gather car listings from various sources. These scrapers are designed to handle page structure changes, avoid IP bans, and overcome anti-spam measures like finger.\n\n**Data Processing Pipeline**: The collected data is processed through a pipeline that includes data cleaning, normalization, and enrichment. This ensures that the data is consistent and ready for analysis.\n\n**Storage**: The system uses a combination of relational and non-relational databases to store current and historical data. This allows for efficient querying and retrieval of large datasets.\n\n**Analytics Engine**: An advanced analytics engine processes the data to generate insights and answer key questions about the automotive market. This engine uses machine learning algorithms and statistical models.\n\n**API Gateway**: The API gateway handles all incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices. It also manages authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.\n\n**Monitoring and Alerting**: A comprehensive monitoring and alerting system tracks the performance of each microservice and the overall system health. This system is configured with numerous notifications to monitor and track scraping behavior, ensuring that any issues or anomalies are detected and addressed promptly. This includes alerts for changes in page structure and potential anti-scraping measures.\n\n# Challenges and Practical Recommendations\n\nBelow are the challenges we faced in our web scraping platform and the practical recommendations we implemented to overcome them. These insights are based on real-world experiences and are aimed at providing you with actionable strategies to handle similar issues.\n\n# Challenge: Handling page structure changes\n\n# Overview\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in web scraping is handling changes in the structure of web pages. Websites often update their layouts, either for aesthetic reasons or to improve user experience. These changes can break scrapers that rely on specific HTML structures to extract data.\n\n# Impact\n\nWhen a website changes its structure, scrapers can fail to find the data they need, leading to incomplete or incorrect data collection. This can severely impact the quality of the data and the insights derived from it, rendering the analysis ineffective.\n\n# Recommendation 1: Leverage API Endpoints\n\nTo handle the challenge of frequent page structure changes, we shifted from scraping **HTML** to leveraging the underlying **API** endpoints used by web applications (*yes, it’s not always possible*). By inspecting network traffic, identifying, and testing API endpoints, we achieved more stable and consistent data extraction. For example, finding the right API endpoint and parameters can take anywhere from an **hour** to a **week**. In some cases, we logically deduced endpoint paths, while in the best scenarios, we discovered GraphQL documentation by appending `/docs` to the base URL. If you're interested in an in-depth guide on how to find and use these APIs, let me know, and I'll provide a detailed description in following parts.\n\n# Recommendation 2: Utilize Embedded Data Structures\n\nSome modern web applications embed structured data within their **HTML** using data structures like **\\_NEXTDATA**. This approach can also be leveraged to handle page structure changes effectively.\n\n# Recommendation 3: Define Required Properties\n\nTo control **data quality**, define the **required properties** that **must** **be** **fetched** to **save** and use the **data** for further **analytics**. Attributes from different sources can vary, so it’s critical to define **what is required** based on your **domain model** and future usage. Utilize the **Template Method Pattern** to dictate how and what attributes should be collected during parsing, ensuring **consistency** across all **sources** and all types (HTML, Json) of **parsers.**\n\n    namespace Example\n    {\n        public abstract class CarParserBase<TElement, TSource>\n        {\n            protected ParseContext ParseContext;\n    \n            protected virtual int PinnedAdsCount => 0;\n            protected abstract string GetDescription(TElement element);\n            protected abstract IEnumerable<TElement> GetCarsAds(TSource document);\n            protected abstract string GetFullName(TElement element);\n            protected abstract string GetAdId(TElement element);\n            protected abstract string GetMakeName(TElement element);\n            protected abstract string GetModelName(TElement element);\n            protected abstract decimal GetPrice(TElement element);\n            protected abstract string GetRegion(TElement element);\n            protected abstract string GetCity(TElement element);\n            protected abstract string GetSourceUrl(TElement element);\n    \n            // more attributes here\n    \n            private protected List<ParsedCar> ParseInternal(TSource document, ExecutionContext executionContext)\n            {\n                try\n                {\n                    var cars = GetCarsAds(document)\n                    .Skip(PinnedAdsCount)\n                    .Select(element =>\n                    {\n                        ParseContext = new ParseContext();\n                        ParseContext.City = GetCity(element);\n                        ParseContext.Description = GetDescription(element);\n                        ParseContext.FullName = GetFullName(element);\n                        ParseContext.Make = GetMakeName(element);\n                        ParseContext.Model = GetModelName(element);\n                        ParseContext.YearOfIssue = GetYearOfIssue(element);\n                        ParseContext.FirstRegistration = GetFirstRegistration(element);\n                        ParseContext.Price = GetPrice(element);\n                        ParseContext.Region = GetRegion(element);\n                        ParseContext.SourceUrl = GetSourceUrl(element);\n                  \n                        return new ParsedCar(\n                            fullName: ParseContext.FullName,\n                            makeName: ParseContext.Make,\n                            modelName: ParseContext.Model,\n                            yearOfIssue: ParseContext.YearOfIssue,\n                            firstRegistration: ParseContext.FirstRegistration,\n                            price: ParseContext.Price,\n                            region: ParseContext.Region,\n                            city: ParseContext.City,\n                            sourceUrl: ParseContext.SourceUrl\n                        );\n                    })\n                    .ToList();\n    \n                    return cars;\n                }\n                catch (Exception e)\n                {\n                    Log.Error(e, \"Unexpected parsering error...\");\n                    throw;\n                }         \n            }\n        }\n    \n        \n    }\n\n# Recommendation 4: Dual Parsers Approach\n\nIf possible, cover the **parsed** **source** with two types of parsers — **HTML** and **JSON** (via direct access to API). Place them **in priority order** and implement something like **chain-of-responsibility pattern** to have a fallback mechanism if the HTML or JSON structure changes due to updates. This provides a window to update the parsers but requires double effort to maintain both. Additionally, implement rotating priority and the ability to **dynamically** remove or change the priority of parsers in the chain via metadata in storage. This allows for dynamic adjustments without redeploying the entire system.\n\n# Recommendation 5: Integration Tests\n\nIntegration tests are crucial, even just for local debugging and quick issue identification and resolution. Especially if something breaks in the live environment and logs are not enough to understand the issue, these tests will be invaluable for debugging. Ideally, these tests can be placed inside the CI/CD pipeline, but if the source requires a proxy or advanced techniques to fetch data, maintaining and supporting these tests inside CI/CD can become overly complicated.\n\n# Challenge: Avoiding IP bans\n\n# Overview\n\nAvoiding IP bans is a critical challenge in web scraping, especially when scraping large volumes of data from multiple sources. Websites implement various anti-scraping measures to detect and block IP addresses that exhibit suspicious behavior, such as making too many requests in a short period.\n\n# Impact\n\nWhen an IP address is banned, the scraper cannot access the target website, resulting in incomplete data collection. Frequent IP bans can significantly disrupt the scraping process, leading to data gaps and potentially causing the entire scraping operation to halt. This can affect the quality and reliability of the data being collected, which is crucial for accurate analysis and decision-making.\n\n# Common Causes of IP Bans\n\n1. **High Request Frequency:** Sending too many requests in a short period.\n2. **Identical Request Patterns:** Making repetitive or identical requests that deviate from normal user behavior.\n3. **Suspicious User-Agent Strings:** Using outdated or uncommon user-agent strings that raise suspicion.\n4. **Lack of Session Management:** Failing to manage cookies and sessions appropriately.\n5. **Geographic Restrictions:** Accessing the website from regions that are restricted or flagged by the target website.\n\n# Recommendation 1: Utilize Cloud Services for Distribution\n\nUtilizing cloud services like **AWS Lambda**, **Azure Functions**, or **Google Cloud Functions** can help avoid IP bans. These services have **native** **time** **triggers**, can **scale out well**, run on a **range of IP addresses**, and can be **located** in **different** **regions** close to the real users of the source. This approach distributes the load and mimics genuine user behavior, reducing the likelihood of IP bans.\n\n# Recommendation 2: Leverage Different Types of Proxies\n\nEmploying a variety of proxies can help distribute requests and reduce the risk of IP bans. There are three main types of proxies to consider\n\n**Datacenter Proxies**\n\n* **Pros:** Fast, affordable, and widely available.\n* **Cons:** Easily detected and blocked by websites due to their non-residential nature.\n\n**Residential Proxies**\n\n* **Pros:** Use IP addresses from real residential users, making them harder to detect and block.\n* **Cons:** More expensive and slower than datacenter proxies.\n\n**Mobile Proxies**\n\n* **Pros:** Use IP addresses from mobile carriers, offering high anonymity and low detection rates.\n* **Cons:** The most expensive type of proxy and potentially slower due to mobile network speeds.\n\nBy leveraging a mix of these proxy types, you can better distribute your requests and reduce the likelihood of detection and banning.\n\n# Recommendation 3: Use Scraping Services\n\nServices like [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/), [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/), [Brightdata](https://brightdata.com/) and similar platforms handle much of the heavy lifting regarding scraping and avoiding IP bans. They provide built-in solutions for rotating IP addresses, managing user agents, and avoiding detection. However, these services can be quite expensive. In our experience, we often exhausted a whole month’s plan in a single day due to high data demands. Therefore, these services are best used if budget allows and the data requirements are manageable within the service limits. Additionally, we found that the most complex sources with advanced anti-scraping mechanisms often did not work well with such services.\n\n# Recommendation 4: Combine approaches\n\nIt makes sense to utilize all the mechanisms mentioned above in a sequential manner, starting from **the lowest** to the **highest** **cost** solutions, using something like **chain-of-responsibility** pattern like was mentioned for different type of parsers above. This approach, similar to the one used for JSON and HTML parsers, allows for a flexible and dynamic combination of strategies. All these strategies can be **stored** and **updated** **dynamically** as metadata in storage, enabling efficient and adaptive scraping operations\n\n[Something like this ](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*hUD-2QxzISBZkjFNSkDcWA.jpeg)\n\n# Recommendation 5: Mimic User Traffic Patterns\n\nScrapers should be hidden within typical user traffic patterns based on time zones. This means making more requests during the day and almost zero traffic during the night, mimicking genuine user behavior. The idea is to split the parsing schedule frequency into 4–5 parts:\n\n* **Peak Load**\n* **High Load**\n* **Medium Load**\n* **Low Load**\n* **No Load**\n\nThis approach reduces the chances of detection and banning. Here’s an example parsing frequency pattern for a typical day:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5jc2iwglbkve1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4083d72458642f13688d9ccdb9c6c43e2caf181\n\n# Challenge: Overcoming anti-spam measures\n\n# Overview\n\nAnti-spam measures are employed by websites to prevent automated systems, like scrapers, from overwhelming their servers or collecting data without permission. These measures can be quite sophisticated, including techniques like user-agent analysis, cookie management, and fingerprinting.\n\n# Impact\n\nAnti-spam measures can block or slow down scraping activities, resulting in incomplete data collection and increased time to acquire data. This affects the efficiency and effectiveness of the scraping process.\n\n# Common Anti-Spam Measures\n\n* **User-Agent Strings**: Websites inspect user-agent strings to determine if a request is coming from a legitimate browser or a known scraping tool. Repeated requests with the same user-agent string can be flagged as suspicious.\n* **Cookies and Session Management**: Websites use cookies to track user sessions and behavior. If a session appears to be automated, it can be terminated or flagged for further scrutiny.\n* **TLS Fingerprinting**: This involves capturing details from the **SSL**/**TLS** handshake to create a unique **fingerprint**. Differences in these fingerprints can indicate automated tools.\n* **TLS Version Detection**: Automated tools might use outdated or less common TLS versions, which can be used to identify and block them.\n\n# Complex Real-World Reactions\n\n* **Misleading IP Ban Messages**: One challenge we faced was receiving messages indicating that our **IP was banned** (too many requests from your IP). However, the **actual** **issue** was related to **missing** **cookies** for **fingerprinting**. We spent considerable time troubleshooting proxies, only to realize the problem wasn’t with the IP addresses.\n* **Fake Data Return**: Some websites counter scrapers by returning **slightly** ***altered*** ***data***. For instance, the mileage of a car might be listed **as 40,000 km** when the **actual value is 80,000 km**. This type of defense makes it difficult to determine if the scraper is functioning correctly.\n* **Incorrect Error Message Reasons**: Servers sometimes return **incorrect** **error** messages, which can **mislead** the scraper about the **actual** **issue**, making troubleshooting more challenging.\n\n# Recommendation 1: Rotate User-Agent Strings\n\nTo overcome detection based on user-agent strings, **rotate** **user-agent** **strings** regularly. Use a variety of legitimate user-agent strings to **simulate** requests from **different** **browsers** and **devices**. This makes it harder for the target website to detect and block scraping activities based on user-agent patterns.\n\n# Recommendation 2: Manage Cookies and Sessions\n\nProperly manage cookies and sessions to maintain continuous browsing sessions. Implement techniques to handle cookies as a real browser would, ensuring that your scraper maintains session continuity. This includes storing and reusing cookies across requests and managing session expiration appropriately.\n\n**Real-world solution**\n\nIn one of the **sources** we encountered, **fingerprint** information was embedded within the **cookies**. Without this specific cookie, it was **impossible** to **make** **more** than **5** requests in a **short** **period** without being banned. We discovered that these cookies **could** **only** be **generated** by **visiting** the **main** **page** of the website with a **real/headless** **browser** and waiting **8–10** seconds for the page to fully load. Due to the **complexity**, **performance** concerns, and **high** **volume** of **requests**, using **Selenium** and **headless** browsers for every request was impractical. Therefore, we implemented the following solution:\n\nWe ran multiple Docker **instances** with **Selenium** installed. These instances **continuously** **visited** the **main** **page**, **mimicking** **user** **authentication**, and **collected** fingerprint cookies. These **cookies** were then **used** in subsequent **high-volume** **scraping** **activities via http request to web server API**, **rotating** them with other **headers** and **proxies** to avoid detection. Thus, we were able to make up to **500,000 requests per day** bypassing the protection.\n\n# Recommendation 3: Implement TLS Fingerprinting Evasion\n\nTo avoid detection via **TLS** **fingerprinting**, mimic the **SSL**/**TLS** **handshake** of a legitimate **browser**. This involves configuring your scraping tool to use common **cipher suites**, **TLS extensions** and **versions** that match those of **real** **browsers**. Tools and libraries that offer configurable SSL/TLS settings can help in achieving this. [This is](https://scrapfly.io/blog/how-to-avoid-web-scraping-blocking-tls/) **great article** on this topic.\n\n**Real-world solution:**\n\nOne of the sources we scraped started returning **fake** **data** due to issues related to **TLS** **fingerprinting**. To resolve this, we had to create a custom proxy in **Go** to modify parameters such as **cipher suites** and **TLS** **versions**, making our scraper appear as a legitimate browser. This approach required deep customization to handle the SSL/TLS handshake properly and avoid detection. [This is](https://github.com/Skyuzii/SpoofingTlsFingerprint) good example in **Go**.\n\n# Recommendation 4: Rotate TLS Versions\n\nEnsure that your scraper supports multiple TLS versions and rotates between them to avoid detection. Using the latest TLS versions commonly used by modern browsers can help in blending in with legitimate traffic.\n\n# Challenge: Maximizing Data Coverage\n\n# Overview\n\nMaximizing data coverage is essential for ensuring that the scraped data represents the most current and comprehensive information available. One common approach is to fetch listing pages **ordered by** the **creation** **date** from the source system. However, during peak times, new data offers can be created so quickly that **not** **all** offers/ads **can** **be** **parsed** from these pages, leading to gaps in the dataset.\n\n# Impact\n\nFailing to capture all new offers can result in incomplete datasets, which affect the accuracy and reliability of subsequent data analysis. This can lead to missed opportunities for insights and reduced effectiveness of the application relying on this data.\n\n# Problem Details\n\n* **High Volume of New Offers:** During peak times, the number of new offers created can exceed the capacity of the scraper to parse all of them in real-time.\n* **Pagination Limitations:** Listing pages often have pagination limits, making it difficult to retrieve all new offers if the volume is high.\n* **Time Sensitivity:** New offers need to be captured as soon as they are created to ensure data freshness and relevance.\n\n# Recommendation: Utilize Additional Filters\n\nUse additional filters to split data by **categories**, **locations**, or **parameters** such as **engine types**, **transmission types**, etc. By segmenting the data, you can increase the frequency of parsing for each filter category. This targeted approach allows for more efficient scraping and ensures comprehensive data coverage.\n\n# Challenge: Mapping reference data across sources\n\n# Overview\n\nMapping reference data is crucial for ensuring consistency and accuracy when integrating data from multiple sources. This challenge is common in various domains, such as **automotive** and **e-commerce**, where different sources may use varying nomenclature for similar entities.\n\n# Impact\n\nWithout proper mapping, the data collected from different sources can be fragmented and inconsistent. This affects the quality and reliability of the analytics derived from this data, leading to potential misinterpretations and inaccuracies in insights.\n\n# Automotive Domain\n\n**Inconsistent Naming Conventions:** Different sources might use different names for the same make, model, or generation. For example, one source might refer to a car model as “**Mercedes-benz v-class**,” while another might call it “**Mercedes v classe**”\n\n**Variations in Attribute Definitions:** Attributes such as **engine types**, **transmission types**, and **trim levels** may also have varying names and descriptions across sources.\n\n# E-commerce Domain\n\n**Inconsistent Category Names:** Different e-commerce platforms might categorize products differently. For instance, one platform might use “**Electronics** \\> **Mobile Phones**,” while another might use “**Electronics** \\> **Smartphones**.”\n\n**Variations in Product Attributes:** Attributes such as brand names, product specifications, and tags can differ across sources, leading to challenges in data integration and analysis.\n\n# Recommendation 1: Create a Reference Data Dictionary\n\nDevelop a comprehensive **reference data dictionary** that includes all possible **names** and **variations**. This dictionary will serve as the central repository for mapping different names to a **standardized** set of terms. Use **fuzzy** **matching** **techniques** during the data collection stage to ensure that similar terms from **different** **sources** are accurately matched to the standardized terms.\n\n# Recommendation 2: Use Image Detection and Classification Techniques\n\nIn cases where **certain** **critical** **attributes**, such as the **generation** of a car model, are not always available from the sources, **image** **detection** and **classification** **techniques** can be employed to identify these characteristics. For instance, using **machine learning** models trained to **recognize** different car **makes**, **models**, and **generations** from **images** can help fill in the gaps when textual data is incomplete or inconsistent. This approach can dramatically **reduce** the amount of **manual** **work** and the need for constant updates to mappings, but it introduces complexity in the **architecture**, **increases** infrastructure **costs**, and can **decrease** **throughput**, **impacting** the **real-time** nature of the data.\n\n# Challenge: Implementing Monitoring and Alerting Systems\n\n# Overview\n\nImplementing effective **monitoring** and **alerting** systems is **crucial** for maintaining the health and performance of a **web** **scraping** **system**. These systems help detect **issues** **early**, **reduce** **downtime**, and ensure that the data collection process runs smoothly. In the context of web scraping, monitoring and alerting systems need to address specific challenges such as **detecting** **changes** in **source** **websites**, **handling** **anti**\\-**scraping** **measures**, and **maintaining** **data** **quality**.\n\n# Impact\n\nWithout proper monitoring and alerting, issues can go unnoticed, leading to incomplete data collection, increased downtime, and potentially significant impacts on data-dependent applications. Effective monitoring ensures timely detection and resolution of problems, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the scraping system.\n\n# Recommendation: Real-Time Monitoring of Scraping Activities\n\nImplement real-time monitoring to track the performance and status of your scraping system. Use tools and dashboards to visualize key metrics such as the number of successful requests, error rates, and data volume. This helps in quickly identifying issues as they occur.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5nwszripbkve1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afb2b969b74185d2fea25cbf3a3035a1e09910b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfxjyvtsbkve1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e07abd91acfc6aee485a9926207a032b135b97c\n\n# Funny Stories at the End\n\nOur system scraped data continuously from different sources, making it highly sensitive to any downtime or changes in website accessibility. There were numerous instances where our scraping system detected that a website was down or not accessible from certain regions. Several times, our team contacted the support teams of these websites, informing them that “User X from Country Y” couldn’t access their site.\n\nIn one memorable case, our automated alerts picked up an issue at 6 AM. The website of a popular car listing service was inaccessible from several European countries. We reached out to their support team, providing details of the downtime. The next morning, they thanked us for the heads-up and informed us that they had resolved the issue. It turned out we had notified them before any of their users did!\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nBuilding and maintaining a **web** **scraping** **system** is **not an easy task**. It requires dealing with **dynamic** **content**, **overcoming** sophisticated **anti**\\-**scraping** **measures**, and **ensuring** high **data** **quality**. While it may seem naive to think that parsing data from various sources is straightforward, the reality involves constant vigilance and adaptation. Additionally, maintaining such a system can be costly, both in terms of infrastructure and the continuous effort needed to address the ever-evolving challenges. By following the steps and recommendations outlined above, you can create a robust and efficient web scraping system capable of handling the challenges that come your way.\n\n# Get in Touch\n\nIf you would like to dive into **any** of these **challenges** in detail, please **let me know in the comments** — I will describe them in **more** **depth**.

        "title": "Diskless Kafka: 80% Cheaper, 100% Open",
        "author": "Affectionate_Pool116",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "# The Problem \n\n**Let’s cut to the chase:** running Kafka in the cloud is expensive. The **inter-AZ replication** is the biggest culprit. There are excellent write-ups on the topic and we don’t want to bore you with yet-another-cost-analysis of Apache Kafka - let’s just agree it costs **A LOT**!\n\n[1 GiB\\/s, with Tiered Storage, 3x fanout Kafka deployment on AWS costs \\>3.4 million\\/year!](https://preview.redd.it/930a20t0ckve1.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=8971b9c98d984bc34dc2b7e20dc5ef580716d01c)\n\nThrough elegant cloud-native architectures, proprietary Kafka vendors have found ways to vastly reduce these costs, albeit at higher latency.\n\n**We want to democratise this feature and merge it into the open source.**\n\n# Enter KIP-1150 \n\n[KIP-1150](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1150%3A+Diskless+Topics) proposes a new class of topics in Apache Kafka that delegates replication to object storage. This completely eliminates cross-zone network fees and pricey disks. You may have seen similar features in proprietary products like Confluent Freight and WarpStream - **but now the community is working to getting it into the open source**. With disks out of the hot path, the usual pains—cluster rebalancing, hot partitions and IOPS limits—are also gone. Because data now lives in elastic object storage, users could reduce costs by up to 80%, spin brokers serving diskless traffic in or out in seconds, and inherit low‑cost geo‑replication. Because it’s simply a new type of topic - you still get to keep your familiar sub‑100ms topics for latency‑critical pipelines, and opt-in ultra‑cheap diskless streams for logs, telemetry, or batch data—all in the same cluster.\n\nGetting started with diskless is one line:\n\n    kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic --config topic.type=diskless\n\nThis can be achieved *without* changing any client APIs and, interestingly enough, modifying just a tiny amount of the Kafka codebase (1.7%).\n\n# Kafka’s Evolution\n\n**Why did Kafka win?** For a long time, it stood at the very top of the streaming taxonomy pyramid—the most general-purpose streaming engine, versatile enough to support nearly any data pipeline. Kafka didn’t just win because it is versatile—it won precisely because it **used disks**. Unlike memory-based systems, Kafka uniquely delivered high throughput and low latency without sacrificing reliability. It handled backpressure elegantly by decoupling producers from consumers, storing data safely on disk until consumers caught up. Most competing systems held messages in memory and would crash as soon as consumers lagged, running out of memory and bringing entire pipelines down.\n\n**But why is Kafka so expensive in the cloud?** Ironically, the same disk-based design that initially made Kafka unstoppable have now become its Achilles’ heel in the cloud. Unfortunately replicating data through local disks just so also happens to be heavily taxed by the cloud providers. The real culprit is the **cloud pricing model itself** \\- not the original design of Kafka - but we must address this reality. With Diskless Topics, Kafka’s story comes full circle. Rather than eliminating disks altogether, Diskless abstracts them away—leveraging object storage (like S3) to keep costs low and flexibility high. Kafka can now offer the best of both worlds, combining its original strengths with the economics and agility of the cloud.\n\n# Open Source\n\nWhen I say **“we”,** I’m speaking for Aiven — I’m the Head of Streaming there, and we’ve poured months into this change. We decided to open source it because even though our business’ leads come from open source Kafka users, our incentives are strongly aligned with the community. If Kafka does well, Aiven does well. Thus, if our Kafka managed service is reliable and the cost is attractive, many businesses would prefer us to run Kafka for them. We charge a management fee on top - but it is always worthwhile as it saves customers more by eliminating the need for dedicated Kafka expertise. **Whatever we save in infrastructure costs, the customer does too!** Put simply, **KIP-1150** is a win for Aiven and a win for the community.\n\n# Other Gains\n\nDiskless topics can do a lot more than reduce costs by >80%. Removing state from the Kafka brokers results in significantly less operational overhead, as well as the possibility of new features, including:\n\n* **Autoscale in seconds:** without persistent data pinned to brokers, you can spin up and tear down resources on the fly, matching surges or drops in traffic without hours (or days) of data shuffling. \n* **Unlock multi-region DR out of the box**: by offloading replication logic to object storage—already designed for multi-region resiliency—you get cross-regional failover at a fraction of the overhead. \n* **No More IOPS Bottlenecks**: Since object storage handles the heavy lifting, you don’t have to constantly monitor disk utilisation or upgrade SSDs to avoid I/O contention. In Diskless mode, your capacity effectively scales with the cloud—not with the broker. \n* **Use multiple Storage Classes** (e.g., [S3 Express](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/up-to-85-price-reductions-for-amazon-s3-express-one-zone/))**:** Alternative storage classes keep the same agility while letting you fine‑tune cost versus performance—choose near‑real‑time tiers like S3 Express when speed matters, or drop to cheaper archival layers when latency can relax.\n\nOur hope is that by lowering the cost for streaming we expand the horizon of what is streamable and make Kafka economically viable for a whole new range of applications. As data engineering practitioners, we are really curious to hear what ***you*** think about this change and whether we’re going in the right direction.

        "author": "LinasData",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "The original data chaos actually started *before* spreadsheets were common. In the pre-ERP days, most business systems were siloed—HR, finance, sales, you name it—all running on their own. To report on anything meaningful, you had to extract data from each system, often manually. These extracts were pulled at different times, using different rules, and then stitched togethe. The result? Data quality issues. And to make matters worse, people were running these reports directly against transactional databases—systems that were supposed to be optimized for speed and reliability, not analytics. The reporting load bogged them down.\n\nThe problem was so painful for the businesses, so around the late 1980s, a few forward-thinking folks—most famously Bill Inmon—proposed a better way: a data warehouse.\n\nTo make matter even worse, in the late ’00s every department had its own spreadsheet empire. Finance had one version of “the truth,” Sales had another, and Marketing were inventing their own metrics. People would walk into meetings with totally different numbers for the same KPI.\n\nThe spreadsheet party had turned into a data chaos rave. There was no lineage, no source of truth—just lots of tab-switching and passive-aggressive email threads. It wasn’t just annoying—it was a risk. Businesses were making big calls on bad data. So data warehousing became common practice!\n\nMore about it: [https://www.corgineering.com/blog/How-Data-Warehouses-Were-Created](https://www.corgineering.com/blog/How-Data-Warehouses-Were-Created)\n\n  \nP.S.

I noticed he's on some kind of PIP thing, and the project has a set deadline which is not realistic. It could be both of us are set up to fail. The code is the worst I have seen in my ten years in the field. No tests, no docs, a mix of prod and test, infra mixed with application code, a misunderstanding of how classes and scope work, etc.\n\nThe project itself is a \"library\" that syncing databricks with data from an external source. We query the external source and insert data into databricks, and every once in a while query the source again for changes (for sake of discussion, lets assume these are page reads per user) which need to be done incrementally. We also frequently submit new jobs to the external source with the same project. what we ingest from the source is not a lot of data, usually under 1 million rows and rarely over 100k a day. \n\nRoughly 75% of the code is doing computation in python for databricks, where they first pull out the dataframe and then filter it down with python and spark. The remaining 25% is code to wrap the API on the external source. All code lives in databricks and is mostly vanilla python. It is called from a notebook. (...)\n\nMy only idea is that the \"library\" should be split instead of having to do everything. The ingestion part of the source can be handled by dbt and we can make that work first. The part that holds the logic to manipulate the dataframes and submit new jobs to the external api is buggy and I feel it needs to be gradually rewritten, but we need to double the features to this part of the code base if we are to make the deadline. \n\nI'm already pushing back on the deadline and I'm pulling in another DE to work on this, but I am wondering what my technical approach should be.",

        "author": "SnooAdvice7613",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi folks. My company is trying to switch some batch jobs to streaming. The current method is that the data are streaming data through Kafka, then there's a Spark streaming job that consumes the data and appends them to a raw table (with schema defined, so not 100% raw). Then we have some scheduled batch jobs (also Spark) that read data from the raw table, transform the data, load them into destination tables, and show them in the dashboards. We use Databricks for storage (Unity catalog) and compute (Spark), but use something else for dashboards.\n\nNow we are trying to switch these scheduled batch jobs into streaming, since the incoming data are already streaming anyway, why not make use of it and turn our dashboards into realtime. It makes sense from business perspective too.\n\nHowever, we've been facing some difficulty in rewriting the transformation jobs from batch to streaming. Turns out, Spark streaming doesn't support some imporant operations in batch. Here are a few that I've found so far:\n\n1. Spark streaming doesn't support window function (e.g. : ROW\\_NUMBER() OVER (...)). Our batch transformations have a lot of these.\n2. Joining streaming dataframes is more complicated, as you have to deal with windows and watermarks (I guess this is important for dealing with unbounded data). So it breaks many joining logic in the batch jobs.\n3. Aggregations are also more complicated. For example you can't do this: raw\\_df -> get aggregated df from raw\\_df -> join aggregated\\_df with raw\\_df\n\nSo far I have been working around these limitations by using Foreachbatch and using intermediary tables (Databricks delta table). However, I'm starting to question this approach, as the pipelines get more complicated. Another method would be refactoring the entire transformation queries to conform both the business logic and streaming limitations, which is probably not feasible in our scenario.\n\nHave any of you encountered such scenario and how did you deal with it? Or maybe do you have some suggestions or ideas? Thanks in advance.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,\nI’m facing a philosophical question at work and I can’t find an answer that would put my brain at ease. \n\nBasically we work with Databricks and Pyspark for ingestion and transformation.\n\nWe have a new data provider that sends crypted and zipped files to an s3 bucket. There are a couple of thousands of files (2 years of historic).\n\nWe wanted to use dataloader from databricks. It’s basically a spark stream that scans folders, finds the files that you never ingested (it keeps track in a table) and reads the new files only and write them.\nThe problem is that dataloader doesn’t handle encrypted and zipped files (json files inside).\n\nWe can’t unzip files permanently. \n\nMy coworker proposed that we use the autoloader to find the files (that it can do) and in that spark stream use the for each batch method to apply a lambda that does:\n- get the file name (current row)\n-decrypt and unzip\n-hash the files (to avoid duplicates in case of failure)\n-open the unzipped file using spark\n-save in the final table using spark \n\nI argued that it’s not the right place to do all that and since it’s not the use case of autoloader it’s not a good practice, he argues that spark is distributed and that’s the only thing we care since it allows us to do what we need quickly even though it’s hard to debug (and we need to pass the s3 credentials to each executor using the lambda…)\n\nI proposed a homemade solution which isn’t the most optimal, but it seems better and easier to maintain which is:\n- use boto paginator to find files\n- decrypt and unzip each file \n- write then json in the team bucket/folder\n-create a monitoring table in which we save the file name, hash, status (ok/ko) and exceptions if there are any\n\nHe argues that this is not efficient since it’ll only use one single node cluster and not parallelised. \n\nI never encountered such use case before and I’m kind of stuck, I read a lot of literature but everything seems very generic. \n\nEdit: we only receive 2 to 3 files daily per data feed (150mo per file on average) but we have 2 years of historical data which amounts to around 1000 files. So we need 1 run for all the historic then a daily run. \nEvery feed ingested is a class instantiation (a job on a cluster with a config) so it doesn’t matter if we have 10 feeds. \n\nEdit2: 1000 files roughly summed to 130go after unzipping. Not sure of average zip/json file though. \n\nWhat do you people think of this? Any advices ?\nThank you ",

        "content": "So, I'm currently working on a project (my first) to create a scalable data platform for a company. The whole thing structured around AWS, initially using DMS to migrate PostgreSQL data to S3 in parquet format (this is our raw datalake). Then using Glue jobs to read this data and create Iceberg tables which would be used in Athena queries and Quicksight. I've got a working Glue script for reading this data and perform upsert operations. Okay so now that I've given a bit of context of what I'm trying to do, let me tell you my problem.  \nThe client wants me to schedule this job to run every 15min or so for staging and most probably every hour for production. The data in the raw datalake is partitioned by date (for example: s3bucket/table\\_name/2025/04/10/file.parquet). Now that I have to run this job every 15 min or so I'm not sure how to keep track of the files that have been processed and which haven't. Currently my script finds the current time and modifies the read command to use just the folder for the current date. But still, this means that I'll be reading all the files in the folder (processed already or not) every time the job runs during the day.   \nI've looked around and found that using DynamoDB for keeping track of the files would be my best option but also found something related to Iceberg metadata files that could help me with this. I'm leaning towards the Iceberg option as I wanna make use of all its features but have too little information regarding this to implement. would absolutely appreciate it if someone could help me out with this.  \nHas anyone worked with Iceberg in this matter? and if the iceberg solution isn't usable, could someone help me out with how to implement the DynamoDB way.",

        "author": "No-Exam2934",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey, I think there are better use cases for event sourcing.  \n  \nEvent sourcing is an architecture where you capture every change in your system as an immutable event, rather than just storing the latest state. Instead of only knowing what your data looks like now, you keep a full history of how it got there. In a simple crud app that would mean that every deleted, updated, and created entry is stored in your event source, that way when you replay your events you can recreate the state that the application was in at any given time.\n\nMost developers see event sourcing as a kind of technical safety net: - Recovering from failures - Rebuilding corrupted read models - Auditability\n\nSurviving schema changes without too much pain\n\nAnd fair enough, replaying your event stream often feels like a stressful situation. Something broke, you need to fix it, and you’re crossing your fingers hoping everything rebuilds cleanly.\n\nWhat if replaying your event history wasn’t just for emergencies? What if it was a normal, everyday part of building your system?\n\nInstead of treating replay as a recovery mechanism, you treat it as a development tool — something you use to evolve your data models, improve your logic, and shape new views of your data over time. More excitingly, it means you can derive entirely new schemas from your event history whenever your needs change.\n\nYour database stops being the single source of truth and instead becomes what it was always meant to be: a fast, convenient cache for your data, not the place where all your logic and assumptions are locked in.\n\nWith a full event history, you’re free to experiment with new read models, adapt your data structures without fear, and shape your data exactly to fit new purposes — like enriching fields, backfilling values, or building dedicated models for AI consumption. Replay becomes not about fixing what broke, but about continuously improving what you’ve built.\n\nAnd this has big implications — especially when it comes to AI and MCP Servers.\n\nMost application databases aren’t built for natural language querying or AI-powered insights. Their schemas are designed for transactions, not for understanding. Data is spread across normalized tables, with relationships and assumptions baked deeply into the structure.\n\nBut when you treat your event history as the source of truth, you can replay your events into purpose-built read models, specifically structured for AI consumption.\n\nNeed flat, denormalized tables for efficient semantic search? Done. Want to create a user-centric view with pre-joined context for better prompts? Easy. You’re no longer limited by your application’s schema — you shape your data to fit exactly how your AI needs to consume it.\n\nAnd here’s where it gets really interesting: AI itself can help you explore your data history and discover what’s valuable.\n\nInstead of guessing which fields to include, you can use AI to interrogate your raw events, spot gaps, surface patterns, and guide you in designing smarter read models. It’s a feedback loop: your AI doesn’t just query your data — it helps you shape it.\n\nSo instead of forcing your AI to wrestle with your transactional tables, you give it clean, dedicated models optimized for discovery, reasoning, and insight.\n\nAnd the best part? You can keep iterating. As your AI use cases evolve, you simply adjust your flows and replay your events to reshape your models — no migrations, no backfills, no re-engineering.",

Cold‑start worries me a bit.\n\n\t2.\tPayload format: For ≤ 200 k rows, is it worth the complexity of sending Arrow/Polars over HTTP, or should I stick with plain JSON for map markers?

Would love to hear real-world experiences on what actually scales, especially for large dimensions (10M+ rows) - how do you balance the Spark vs Redshift work while keeping everything consistent?\n\nLast but not least I want to know how to ensure fact tables are properly pointing to dimension tables, do we fill the foreign key column in spark before loading to redshift? \n\nPS: if you have any learning resources with practical implementations and best practices in place please provide them, because I feel the majority of the info on the web is theoretical.   \nThank you in advance.",

        "author": "RC-05",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi Folks,\n\nIn my current project, we are ingesting a wide variety of external public datasets. One common issue we’re facing is that the **country names in these datasets are not standardized**. For example, we may encounter entries like **\"Burma\" instead of \"Myanmar\"**, or **\"Islamic Republic of Iran\" instead of \"Iran\"**.\n\nMy initial approach was to extract all unique country name variations and map them to a list of standard country names using logic such as CASE WHEN conditions or basic string-matching techniques.\n\nHowever, my manager has suggested we leverage **AI/LLM-based models** to automate the mapping of these country names to a standardized list to handle new query points as well. \n\nI have a couple of concerns and would appreciate your thoughts:\n\n1. **Is using AI/LLMs a suitable approach for this problem?**\n2. **Can LLMs be fully reliable in these mappings, or is there a risk of incorrect matches?**\n3. I was considering implementing a **feedback pipeline** that highlights any newly encountered or unmapped country names during data ingestion so we can review and incorporate logic to handle them in the code over time. Would this be a better or complementary solution?\n4. Please suggest if there is some better approach.\n\nLooking forward to your insights!",

These instruments are standalone (not connected to the internet), but they might be connected to a computer that has access to a network drive (e.g., an SMB share).\n2. The output files are typically in a binary format. Instrument vendors usually don’t provide parsers or APIs, as they want to protect their proprietary technologies.\n3. In most cases, the instruments come with dedicated software for data analysis, and the results can be exported as XLSX or CSV files. However, since each user may perform the analysis differently and customize how the reports are exported, the output formats can vary significantly—even for the same instrument.\n4. Even if we can parse the raw or exported files, interpreting the data often requires domain knowledge from the lab scientists.\n\nGiven these constraints, is it even possible to build a reliable ELT/ETL pipeline?",

As you can see, addresses and names are in inconsistent formats. \nI have another dataset that will be me ground truth for companies. It has a clean name for the company along with it’s parsed address. \n\nThe objective is to match the records from the table with inconsistent formats to the ground truth, so that each product is linked to a clean company. \n\n\n\nQuestions and help: \n- i was thinking to use google geocoding api to parse the addresses and get geocoding. Then use the geocoding to perform distance search between my my addresses and ground truth BUT i don’t have the geocoding in the ground truth dataset. So, i would like to find another method to match parsed addresses without using geocoding. \n\n- Ideally, i would like to be able to input my parsed address and the name (maybe along with some other features like industry of activity) and get returned the top matching candidates from the ground truth dataset with a score between 0 and 1. Which approach would you suggest that fits big size datasets? \n\n- The method should be able to handle cases were one of my addresses could be: company A, address: Washington (meaning an approximate address that is just a city for example, sometimes the country is not even specified). I will receive several parsed addresses from this candidate as Washington is vague. What is the best practice in such cases? As the google api won’t return a single result, what can i do?\n\n- My addresses are from all around the world, do you know if google api can handle the whole world? Would a language model be better at parsing for some regions? \n\nHelp would be very much appreciated, thank you guys. \n",

My tasks generally are like this\n\n1. put configurations so that the source dataset can ingest and preprocess into aws s3 in correct file format. I've noticed sometimes filepath names randomly change without warning which would cause configs to change so I would have to be cognizant of that. \n\n2. the s3 output is then put into a mapping tool (which in my experience is super slow and frequently annoying to use) we have to map source -> our schema\n\n3. once you update things in the mapping tool, it SHOULD export automatically to S3 and show in production environment after refresh, which is usually. However, keyword should. There are times where my data didn't show up and it turned out I have to 'manually export' a file to S3 without being made aware beforehand which files require manual export and which ones occur automatically through our pipeline\n\n4. I then usually have to develop a SQL view that combines data from various sources for different purposes\n\nThe issues I'm facing lately....\n\nA colleague left end of last year and I've noticed that my workload has dramatically changed. I've been given tasks that I can only assume were once hers from another colleague. The thing is the tasks I'm given:\n\n1. Have zero documentation. I have no clue what the task is meant to accomplish\n\n2. I have very vague understanding of the source data \n\n3. Just go off of an either previously completed script, which sometimes suffers from major issues (too many subqueries, thousands of lines of code). Try to realistically manage how/if to refactor vs. using same code and 'coming back to it later' if I have time constraints. After using similar code, randomly realize the requirements of old script changed b/c my data doesn't populate in which I have to ask my boss what the issue \n\n4. Me and my boss have to navigate various excel sheets and communication to play 'guess work' as to what the requirements are so we can get something out \n\n5. Review them with the colleague who assigned it to me who points out things are wrong OR randomly changes the requirements that causes me to make more changes and then expresses frustration 'this is unacceptable', 'this is getting delayed', 'I am getting frustrated' continuously that is making me uncomfortable in asking questions.\n\nI do not directly interact with the stakeholders. The colleague I just mentioned is the person who does and translates requirements back. I really, honestly have no clue what is going through the stakeholders mind or how they intend to use the product. All I frequently hear is that 'they are not happy', 'I am frustrated', 'this is too slow'. I am expected to get things out within few hours to 1-2 business days. This doesn't give me enough time to ensure if I made many mistakes in the process. I will take accountability that I have made some mistakes in this process by fixing things then not checking and ensuring things are as expected that caused further delays. Overall, I am under constant pressure to churn things out ASAP and I'm struggling to keep up and feel like many mistakes are a result of the pressure to do things fast.\n\nI have told my boss and colleague in detail (even wrote it up) that it would be helpful for me to: 1. just have 1-2 sentences as to what this project is trying to accomplish 2. better documentation.  People have agreed with me but they have not really done much b/c everybody is too busy to document since once one project is done, I'm pulled into the next. I personally am observing a technical debt problem here, but I am new to my job and new to data engineering (was previously in a different analytics role) so I am trying to figure out if this is a me issue and where I can take accountability or this speaks to broader issues with my team and I should consider another job. I am honestly thinking about starting the job search again in a few months, but I am quite discouraged with my current experience and starting to notice signs of burnout.",

We plan to use Power BI as our reporting tool, and all departments in the company will rely on it for analytics.\n\nThe challenge is that teams from different departments expect **the data to be fully related and ready** to use when building dashboards, minimizing the need for additional modeling. We’re struggling to determine the best approach to meet these expectations.\n\nWhat would you recommend?\n\nShould all dimensions and facts be pre-related in the data warehouse, even if it adds complexity?\n\nCreating separate data models in Power BI for different departments/use cases?\n\nHandling all relationships in the data warehouse and exposing them via curated datasets?\n\nShould we empower Power BI users to create their own data models, or enforce strict governance with documented relationships?\n\nThanks in advance for your insights!

The data load is incremental.\n\nWhile in theory dimensional modeling ( star schemas to be exact ) is not hard, I am finding a hard time implementing the actual model.\n\nI want to know how are these dimensional modeling concepts are actually implemented, the following is  my thoughts about how I understand some theoretical concepts and the way I find gaps between them and the actual practice.\n\n**Avoiding duplicates in both fact and dimension tables** –does this happen in the Spark job or Redshift itself? \n\nI feel like for transactional fact tables it is not a problem, but for dimensions, it is not straight forward: you need to insure uniqueness of entries for all the table not just the chunk you loaded during this run and this raises the above question, whether it is done in Spark, and in this case we will need to somehow load the dimension table  in dataframes so that we can filter new data loads, or in redshidt, and in this case we just load everything new to Redshift and delegate upserts and duplication checks to Redshift.\n\n  \nAnd speaking of uniqueness of entries in dimension tables ( I know it is getting long, bear with me, we are almost there xD) , we have to also allow exceptions, because when dealing with **SCD type 2,** we must allow duplicate entries and update the old ones to be depricated, so again how is this exception implemented practically? \n\n**Surrogate keys** – Generate in Spark (eg. UUIDs/hashes?) or rely on Redshift `IDENTITY` for example?\n\nSurrogate keys are going to serve as primary keys for both our fact and dimension tables, so they have to be unique, again do we generate them in Spark then load to, Redshift or do we just make Redshift handle these for us and not worry about uniqueness? \n\n**Fact-dim integrity** – Resolve FKs in Spark or after loading to Redshift?\n\nAnother concern arises when talking about surrogate keys, each fact table has to point to its dimensions with FKs, which in reality will be the surrogate keys of the dimensions, so these columns need to be filled with the right values, I am wondering whether this is done in Spark, and in this case we will have to again load the dimensions from Redshift in Spark dataframes and extract the right values of FKs, or can this be done in Reshift????\n\nIf you have any thoughts or insights please feel free to share them, litterally anything can help at this point xD",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone, \n\nwe are a company that relies heavy on a so called no-code middleware that combines many different aspects of typical data engineering stuff into one big platform. However we have found ourselves (finally) in the situation that we need to migrate to a lets say more fundamental tech stack that relies more on knowledge about programming, databases and sql. I wanted to ask if someone has been in the same situation and what their experiences have been. Our only option right now is to migrate for business reasons and it will happen, the only question is what we are going to use and how we will use it. \n\n**Background:**  \nWe use this platform as our main \"engine\" or tool to map various business proccess. The platform includes creation and management of various kinds of \"connectors\" including Http, as2, mail, x400 and whatnot. You can then create profiles that can get fetch and transform data based on what comes in by one of the connectors and load the data directly into your database, create files or do whatever the business logic requires. The platform provides a comprehensive amount of logging and administration. In my honest opinion, that is quite a lot that this tool can offer. Does anyone know any kind of other tool that can do the same? I heard about Apache Airflow or Apache Nifi but only on the surface. \n\nThe same platform we are using right now has another software solution for building database entities on top of its own database structure to create \"input masks\" for users to create, change or read data and also apply business logic. We use this tool to provide whole platforms and even \"build\" basic websites. \n\nWhat would be the best tech stack to migrate to if your goal was to cover all of the above? I mean there probably is not an all in one solution but that is not what we are looking for right now. If you said to me that for example apache nifi in combination with python would be enough to cover everything our middleware provided would be more than enough for me.  \n  \nWhat is essential for us is also a good logging capability. We need to make sure that whatever data flows are happening or have happended is comprehensible in case of errors or questions. \n\nFor input masks and simple web platforms we are currently using C# Blazor and have multiple projects that are working very well, which we could also migrate to.

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nMy use case is one faced, no doubt, by many companies across many industries: We have millions of files in legacy sources, ranging from horrible scans of paper records, to (largely) tidy CSVs. They sit on prem in various locations, or in Azure blob containers. \n\nWe use Airflow and Python to automate what we can - starting with dropping all the files into Azure blob storage, and the triaging the files by their extensions. Archive files are unzipped and the outputs dumped back to Azure blob. Everything is deduplicated. Then any CSVs, Excels, and JSONs have various bits of structural information pulled out (e.g., normalised field names, data types, etc.) and compared against 'known' records, for which we have Polars-based transformation scripts which enable them for loading into our Postgres database. We often need to tweak these transformations to account for any edge cases, without making them too generic or losing any backwards compatibility with already-processed files. Anything that doesn't go through this route goes through a series of complex ML-based processes for classification. \n\nThe problem is, automating ETL in this way means it's difficult to make a dent in the huge backlog, and most files end up going to classification.\n\nI am just wondering if anyone here has been in a similar situation, and if any light can be shed on other possible routes to success here?\n\nCheers.",

For example, going through and doing the Leetcode questions now \"14. Longest Common Prefix\" - I have no idea where I would even begin. \n\nCould anyone suggest any books, or if you have gone through something similar if you have only worked in game engines professionally and started to do this Leetcode questions.\n\nAfter writing this, I am starting to think I am a professional games programmer and not a programmer in general - If anyone has had this experience, it would be great if you could let me know how you went about expanding your skill-set and experience.",

        "content": "Many platforms only display API keys once, forcing the user to regenerate if lost. This is often justified vaguely as a \"security measure.\" But what is the *actual security threat* being mitigated by hiding the key from the legitimate, authenticated owner?\n\nIf an attacker gains access to the dashboard, they can revoke or generate new keys anyway—so not showing the old key doesn't protect you from a compromised account. And if the account isn’t compromised, why can’t the rightful owner see the key again?\n\nMoreover, some major platforms like Google still allow users to view and copy API keys multiple times. So clearly, it's *not* an industry-wide best practice.\n\nIs this practice really about security, or is it just risk management and legal liability mitigation?  \nIf hiding the key is purely to protect from insiders or accidental leaks, isn't that a weak argument—especially considering that most providers let you revoke/regenerate keys at will?\n\nSo what *real* security benefit does hiding an API key from its owner provide—if any? Or is this just theater?\n\nEdit 1 -----------------\n\n**Please also address this point in your responses:**\n\nIf this is truly a security issue, then why does a company like **Google** — certainly not a small or inexperienced player — allow the **API key for its Gemini product** (used by millions of people) to be displayed openly and copied multiple times in **Google AI Studio**?\n\nThis is not some niche tool with a limited user base, nor is Google unfamiliar with security best practices. It's hard to believe that a company of Google's scale and expertise would make such a fundamental mistake — especially on a product as widely used and high-profile as Gemini.\n\nIf showing the API key multiple times were truly a critical security flaw, it’s reasonable to assume Google would have addressed it.

In reality most these AI tools still can't do what an experienced developer does.\n\nDebugging is always painful. The UX often feels clunky. And if you want anything more than a simple landing page or CRUD app, you still need to understand how things actually work.\n\nWhere they really help is prototyping. You can use something like v0 or Lovable which are great for showing ideas fast, getting feedback and making things visual early on.\n\nThe way I see it going:\n\n* PMs and designers will use these AI tools to build rough prototypes\n* Engineers will pick it up and build the real thing using AI tools like cursor or windsurf to speed things up\n\nWe’re not at the point where you can describe an app and it magically works. But the mix of fast prototyping and AI powered dev tools is already a big step forward.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this.",

I only know JS from being self-taught, and I told them that in the interview. I have been a DA for years, so I have made some great process improvements in that regard. Especially considering nobody understands data structure, SQL, or anything outside basic Excel.\n\nI immediately got thrown in and asked to redesign various pages, tie into APIs, etc. I just scratched the surface of arrow functions, so this was daunting. Still, I have been making progress and doing okay. I just feel like I have large gaps in my knowledge. There's no ticket system here, no tracking. The only gauge on progress is 1v1 meetings with my boss.\n\nMy boss and director don't understand JS. My team does not either. I'm seriously on my own and rely on research and my own grit to make it through. I haven't made any major mistakes, but that's only because I don't know if I have. There's nobody to bounce ideas off of or rely on if I'm on PTO. I don't understand the distinction between the test and prod environment at a deeper level. Sometimes I can update pages on prod through test, and sometimes I can't. There's so many out of date files and I have no clue what bloat we have, or any sort of vulnerabilities we may have in our code.\n\nWith all that being said: I love my job, and I'm actually having a lot of fun within JS. I'm not complaining and am so very grateful that I have a position to apply things I know/learning. I'm learning a lot, I am still being encouraged, my team members have hearts of gold, but it's obvious I am the only one with technical experience here. However, if I moved to a more technical company, I think people would be able to see right through my gaps in knowledge. Just wondering if anyone has been in a similar boat?",

They are used as a place for the users to address and discuss more about the question, since the answers have to be used more to directly answer the question.\n\nWhen you see a StackOverflow question, instead of simply going for the top-rated answer and closing the page, also take a look at the comments, people generally discuss more intrinsically about the proposed solution, like more why it works, the possible drawbacks, etc. The comments may even have a better solution for cases where, for example, the answer is out of date. These discussions generally lead to you having a better understanding of the technology, concepts, language or whatever it is you are looking for.\n\nAnd you can also make questions in the comments! IMO, the comments are the place for the \"simpler\" questions people generally say are pushed back in StackOverflow, as there is generally no pressure to make good and structured questions.\n\nAlso, a bit out of the topic here, but please also take a look at the answers other than the accepted or top-rated ones, they could bring solutions that are more up to date or fit better your scenario.\n\n\nTLDR: StackOverflow comments provides many insights about the questions and answers, being a great place to look for discussions and learn more about the resource, also for asking \"simpler\" questions (also look at answers other than the accepted or top-rated ones).",

My biggest struggle is my indifference toward programming-some days I enjoy it, but other days I really don't. And this semester, I'm honestly not liking it at all, especially because I've been getting really bad grades this semester. I've thought about switching to mechanical engineering since it seems like a broader field, but I'm worried it might not be in demand because of Al and automation. On the other hand, I also wonder if I should just stick with software engineering and pursue a master's in Al to future-proof my career, given how rapidly that field is growing. I guess I'm just torn between these two paths and unsure if software engineering is really the right fit for me long term.",

Having to compile a program and using Makefiles seems like a better introduction to build systems and why we have them than the Python interpreter which just runs your code. \n\nAlso from what I've seen from other people, its much harder to move from python to C than the other way around. Everyone I've met who started with python struggled a lot with C. \n\nWhat are you're guys thoughts about this?",

For context, I have 2 years of work experience, meaning I'm a junior dev:\n\n## Don't learn many languages\n\"Jack of all trades\" only applies at the mid-senior level. In junior->mid level, you should pick one language and framework and stick with it! Even if you want to do full-stack (React + Backend) you should pick a focus between the two. \nIt's rare for a company to want a split 50/50 between them, and the ones biased towards front-end will also favor UI/UX work (figma designs, etc.)\n\n## Build many projects\nBuild, build, build. Don't be like me stuck in a perpetual cycle of tutorial hell, where you value finishing guided tutorials more than actually working on your own projects. Yes, those projects can (with a lot of luck) still get you an interview, but the interviewers will figure out if you really built your own stuff and researched beyond the surface or not.\n\n## Don't use AI (too early)\nLLM editors are great to generate boilerplate, but until you get the hang of it and really, REALLY intentionally understand what the boilerplate is doing (and why it's needed) type everything by memory, and fallback to a reference (docs, Google) when you really struggle to recall something.\nPeople will hate this one, because they'll tell you \"memorization is not the point\" and it's not. The goal is to understand the intention behind everything. Learn the language and framework of your choice more than what every junior Joe and Gary know. It's ultra-competitive right now. Do you really want to blow your chances and lose it all because you went \"meh, I'll let cursor tell me which services and repositories to make, with the basic expected CRUD interfaces\". \nA good rule of thumb is to do that after you know 80%+ of what Cursor is about to generate.\n\n## Keyword Match everything\nOnce upon a time, people treated the keywords in the job opening as wish lists, and told you to \"apply anyways\". In this job market, companies can get whatever they want to get. While it's impossible to cover every base, it's important to consider which languages, frameworks and cloud services are popular along your choice, for your local job market.\n\nThat's it.

        "author": "AngryTrolly",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I’m a woman in my early twenties, and I’ve been doing a programming internship at a big, globally known company for a year now and honestly, I feel completely lost.\n\nI came from an economics background and decided to switch to tech almost two years ago. When I landed this internship, I had zero technical knowledge and was just starting my degree. Getting into such a well-known company so early on felt like a huge win, and in a way, it was. It’s the kind of name that looks amazing on a resume. The salary is really good for an intern, especially considering my financial background, and if I’m lucky enough to stay as a full-time employee, it would make a huge difference in my life financially.\n\nBut the reality inside hasn’t been as exciting as it looked from the outside. From the beginning, I felt completely out of place. I made mistakes, of course,but no one really explained what I was doing wrong or how I could do better. My team has been very distant, and over time, I’ve started to feel like I’m being excluded. Nothing direct or obvious, but there are signs. I try to contribute, show interest, ask questions… but everything I do seems to go unnoticed. It’s like I’m invisible. It makes me feel like all my efforts to grow or connect just don’t matter.\n\nOn top of that, the pressure is intense. Despite being an intern, it often feels like we’re expected to deliver at the level of someone with years of experience. There’s little to no feedback or support, just the expectation to perform. And honestly? It’s draining. I get home with no motivation to study, no energy to try, and I’ve even caught myself wondering if I should just cheat on exams to get through. I hate that it’s come to this.\n\nLately, I’ve been thinking that maybe I should try working at a smaller company—somewhere with a slower pace, less pressure, and where I might actually be able to learn and breathe. But then I feel guilty for even thinking that. The money I make now matters. Staying at this company would open doors. And walking away kind of hurts my ego too—it feels like I’d be “downgrading,” like I couldn’t handle it. But at the same time… what’s the cost of staying? I already feel the early signs of burnout. I’m constantly stressed, anxious, and losing the passion I once had for this field. What if staying just ruins my mental health long-term?\n\nI don’t know. I want to give IT a fair chance because I’ve already changed areas once and I don’t want to give up again. But this whole experience has made me doubt myself and question if I really belong here.\n\nHas anyone else been through something similar? How did you navigate it?",

For instance, if I'm calculating the location of an object to appear on screen, it doesn't really matter if I'm off by .000005, because that location will resolve to one pixel or another. Is there some process for telling hardware, \"stop after reaching x precision\"? It seems like it could save a significant chunk of computing time.\n\nI imagine that thrown out precision will accumulate over time, but if you know the variable won't be around too long, it might not matter. Is this something compilers (or whatever) have already figured out, or is this way of saving time so specific that it has to be implemented at the application level?",

I even have some ideas I believe would be awesome if I could bring them to life.

The function checks to see if the value is within a certain range, and returns a value based on the range the input value falls within:\n\n    int bucket_for_value(unsigned uint8_t x) {\n        if (x >= 0 && x < 32) return 0;\n        else if (x >= 32 && x < 64) return 1;\n        else if (x >= 64 && x < 96) return 2;\n        else if (x >= 96 && x < 128) return 3;\n        else if (x >= 128 && x < 160) return 4;\n        else if (x >= 160 && x < 192) return 5;\n        else if (x >= 192 && x < 224) return 6;\n        else if (x >= 224 && x < 256) return 7;\n        else return -1; // Out of range\n    }\n\nYou see, theoretically there's an equal chance for an arbitrary number to fall within any of these ranges.\n\nNow the challenging part. I want to be able to control the values within the parentheses using a single parameter (for the sake of illustration, imagine a physical knob), where the knob in the center evenly distributes the chance, as above. Then, turning it all the way to the left results in the first statement having a 100% chance in returning 0, like:\n\n    int bucket_for_value(unsigned uint8_t x) {\n        if (x >= 0 && x < 256) return 0;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 1;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 2;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 3;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 4;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 5;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 6;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 7;\n        else return -1; // Out of range\n    }\n\nAnd turning it all the way to the right results in a 100% chance of returning 7, like:\n\n    int bucket_for_value(unsigned uint8_t x) {\n        if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 0;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 1;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 2;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 3;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 4;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 5;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 6;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 256) return 7;\n        else return -1; // Out of range\n    }\n\nBut I want to also be able to have our hypothetical 'knob' to values between the center and extremes shown above, and have the value be 'weighted' accordingly. I have no idea how to implement this and though to ask here.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice. Appreciated. Thanks!",

I was just curious if anyone would be interested in having somebody to share progress with or anything else. Maybe even try to collaborate at some point. \n\nI’ve only been learning programming and game development for a month or so. But I have a decent understanding of C sharp fundamentals along with unity. I’ve put together a few games like pong, some card games, and a flappy bird clone.(albeit with lots of assistance from the web😅).\n\nI’m really dedicated to improve and learn, as I am really passionate about games/making games. If this is something you’d be interested in feel free to DM me! :D\n\nI figured it would be a cool way to meet people with similar goals, and maybe be able to help eachother and work together. ",

        "content": "tldr: what to keep in mind when making an app with a gui (Dear ImGui), such that it is modular and easy to work with? It this something people figure out from scratch for every project or are there some well know frameworks or rules for this sort of thing? how do i transition from making 1 file mathematical programs like sorting to actual systems that work? this is a very loaded question so sorry in advance.\n\nI'm an undergrad doing a somewhat simple C++ project for a class. It's basically looking stuff up from an API, user chooses some option based on which another API request is made, etc, finally some data is displayed in a plot. I need to also be able to save stuff locally, to later load from a .json and do the same things if the API server is not accessible. Seems simple, right?\n\nI'm struggling a lot with this. Before this I only wrote basic mathematical 1 file programs like sorting and whatnot, but here I have to design a system that works.\n\nI find it very hard to make things modular. Like, rn I may have an idea for a system that handles app states based on some bool flags and enums and each app state has a class which holds and calculates variables that are relevant for that state. At first it seems like its perfect, but then when I actually implement it and something fails, I then realise it was actually very flat and fixing this exception requires restructuring a majority of my work up to that point. This has happened multiple times now.\n\nHow do people actually work on projects like this? What do I need to keep in mind when designing the parts, such that if one thing fails, I can fix just that thing and not the entire project? Do I work from ground up, making up the modules perfectly and then piecing them together, or rather outline the whole system first? Do most people just use some preexisting libraries and frameworks that handle this perfectly and I am mistaken to even consider doing this with vanilla C++?\n\n  \nAnother matter is how much I should cater to my GUI of choice when designing the app. I am using ImGui and with that I always need my data in arrays to put in dropdown menus and i need to keep track of the index of the item the user chose off of that dropdown. I'm not sure if because of that I should handle the data internally also in arrays so that I can easily pass them to imGui for display or if I should do more work to generate them whenever I need to display stuff? I only ever plan for this app to work within ImGui.\n\n",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Our university project asks us to make a clone of the [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) school/course management website (actually, we don't have to write it from scratch, just downloading Moodle source code and modifying necessary parts is acceptable), and make it so that teachers and students can use this website to organize/participate in competitive programming contests, similar to [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) or [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/) (also a clone we have to make, we planned to base on DMOJ because it's open source, and again, writing everything from scratch is not required).\n\nWe are asked to make it so that the target user, a teacher, should preferably use only the Moodle website to be able to put up either homework assignments or live contests for students, and students should be able to upload solution code files on this Moodle clone. The DMOJ clone is only used to automatically grade code using the features that they supported, listed in their [public repository](https://github.com/DMOJ/online-judge). It wouldn't be a good experience if the teacher has to go to the DMOJ website to create contests, thus leaking it to everyone that's not participating in the current (Moodle) course. For students, the DMOJ clone is helpful for them to practice coding problems outside of the school courses, but the requirements are made clear that teachers prefer staying on the Moodle clone platform.\n\nMoodle is mostly [written with PHP](https://github.com/moodle/moodle), DMOJ is mostly written with Python.\n\nI'll start with a question about a login feature. To do the \"user experience\" requirement above, it is necessary to be able to use only Moodle authentication to log in to the DMOJ contest system. To my knowledge, this means making this Moodle clone an OAuth 2.0 provider for other wesbites (like the DMOJ clone that we're also making). My question is: **For the purpose of making Moodle an OAuth 2.0 provider, which plugin, if any, is suitable?** There are about [37 plugins listed](https://moodle.org/plugins/index.php/?q=authentication%20type:auth) on this list, some of which haven't been updated for years, so I want to ask if there's already a popular plugin for this purpose, or I have to write the plugin myself.\n\nI'm pretty new to PHP and web development in general (has followed only basic beginner-friendly video tutorial), so I hope I worded the terms correctly and asked the correct question.",

        "author": "pfffffftnot",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "**Sup nerrrrrds,**\n\nI spent *way* too long figuring this out, so now you don’t have to.\n\nI needed to send mouse clicks to a background window in Windows **without moving the cursor**, **without focusing the window**, and **without interfering with what I was doing** in the foreground. Turns out this is **way harder** than it should be.\n\nI went through it all:\n\n* `pyautogui`? Moves the mouse — nope.\n* `SendInput`? Requires the window to be focused — nope.\n* `PostMessage`? Doesn’t register for most real applications — nope.\n* `SendMessage`? **Surprisingly works**, *if* you do it right.\n\nAfter lots of trial and error, here’s what finally did it — this will send a click to a background window, silently, with no interruption:\n\n    import win32api, win32con, win32gui\n    import logging\n    \n    def click(x, y):\n        try:\n            hwnd = win32gui.FindWindow(None, \"Name of Your Window Here\")\n            if not hwnd:\n                logging.error(\"Target window not found!\")\n                return\n    \n            lParam = win32api.MAKELONG(x, y)\n    \n            # This line is super important — many windows only respond to clicks on child controls\n            hWnd1 = win32gui.FindWindowEx(hwnd, None, None, None)\n    \n            win32gui.SendMessage(hWnd1, win32con.WM_LBUTTONDOWN, win32con.MK_LBUTTON, lParam)\n            win32gui.SendMessage(hWnd1, win32con.WM_LBUTTONUP, None, lParam)\n    \n        except Exception as e:\n            logging.error(f\"Click failed: {e}\")\n\n💡 **Key takeaway**: `FindWindowEx` makes a huge difference. Lots of applications won't respond to `SendMessage` unless you're targeting a child control. If you just send to the top-level window, nothing happens.\n\n# Why this matters\n\nThere are **dozens** of threads asking this same thing going back years, and almost none of them have a clear solution. Most suggestions either don’t work or only work in very specific conditions. This one works reliably for background windows that accept `SendMessage` events.\n\n# Search terms & tags for folks looking later:\n\n* python click background window without focus\n* send mouse input without moving mouse\n* python click off-screen window\n* send click to window while minimized or unfocused\n* background automation win32gui SendMessage\n* click in background window win32 python\n* control window in background without focus\n\nHope this saves you hours of suffering.\n\n**\"Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably.

Sign me up.” It sounded like the ideal setup,, good money, flexible lifestyle, interesting work. But the reality? A whole different beast.\n\nFirst, just learning my job was a battle. Senior folks gatekeeping knowledge, no clear training, just figuring things out on my own through trial, error, and stress. It took way longer than it should’ve and left me constantly feeling like I was behind.\n\nThen I climbed the ladder. On paper, that sounds like a win,,, but every role I left was on the verge of collapsing. I’d move up, get more money, but also inherit more chaos. Now I make decent money, but it comes with a nonstop stream of incidents, rollbacks, escalations, and worst of all: on-call. There’s no break. No peace. I’m always on edge, waiting for the next fire.\n\nMeanwhile, my friends outside of tech? They seem so much lighter. Sure, they’ve got problems like everyone else,,, but they’re not mentally trapped in their jobs 24/7. Me? This job has consumed my life. Even when I’m off, I’m not really off. I’m checking alerts, dreading pings, and thinking about what might break next.\n\nAnd to make things worse, every company wants people with 10+ years of experience, and offshore teams are replacing roles left and right. It’s harder than ever to pivot or even find a quieter tech job.\n\nHonestly? I’m at the point where I just want a normal job. One where I show up, do what I’m supposed to do, and then go live my damn life.\n\nBtw I worked have real jobs before i don’t understand why folks just quick to assume it’s just been tech. I worked construction for years so I know what it’s like I’m just saying I wish I had a role to mentally clock out of like normal roles. \n\n\nSorry for the rant but damn I’m just burnt out.

I have 8 YOE and this was for a senior level position. The screener and I were vibing, I was nailing the technical questions. Then it was time for the coding challenge: screener emailed instructions, said I’d have 20 mins, and promised to give me a 10 min warning and a warning before time was up. This was literally the easiest coding challenge I've ever seen in a candidate screening. I shared my screen, clarified instructions before starting, and was ready to go.\n\nRight then, the screener's mic died. We spent about 5 mins troubleshooting, he left/rejoined, I left/rejoined, he even got new AirPods. Finally, audio fixed, I started the challenge.\n\nI created a folder and three files via command line, pasted some boilerplate HTML/CSS, did a quick google search (allowed per instructions) and found my answer immediately, right then I'm told there's 10 mins left. I briefly thought \"there is no way that took 10 mins\" but moved on. I finished the minimum requirements shortly after, confirmed out loud it met the spec and that I was effectively done. He hadn't indicated time running out, so I asked if I should adjust CSS to make the output more visible, he said \"sure,\" so I did. Still hadn’t announced time, so I ask “do you want me to keep going?” he shrugs lol. Eventually, I asked explicitly if there were edge cases or another part to the coding challenge bc he was making no verbal indications of anything, he said no and asked me to email my code.\n\nI'm super stoked because I know I just nailed that challenge, until he abruptly says he's ending the screening early because I went THREE MINUTES OVER and asks if I have any questions. So I asked if I’d missed a requirement, how long candidates are expected to take (the full 20 mins), if I missed an edge case, etc. Nothing was amiss. So why? Because I went ***three*** minutes over and he didn’t think I would be able to complete the virtual onsite (the next round) in time lmao.\n\nAfter the call (feeling completely demoralized by the cold ending), I checked the timestamps of when he sent the instructions and when I emailed my code. Only 21 mins in between each email, meaning I didn't actually go over, he likely started the timer early due to HIS mic issues. So I sent a polite, non accusatory follow up email letting him know this because he may have not realized and cc’ed the recruiter. No response, I was ghosted.\n\nI get that companies owe candidates nothing, but asking for 40+ hours upfront for a take home project (I did not spend 40 hours on mine, and I also will never do one again bc of this experience) then rejecting over something so trivial is absurd. Even if I had gone over, I aced that screening. I double checked my work after, sent it to ChatGPT, it was solid. Also, again, literally the easiest challenge I’ve ever done and pretty insulting to be told I failed it.\n\nI probably dodged a bullet, but still needed to vent.

The tech job market’s brutal right now—rejections are constant, ghosting is common, and it’s easy to feel like you're just another resume in a pile.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was contacted by a recruiter for a senior level role. They submitted me, and two days later I had the interview. I came in straightforward—no fluff, no buzzwords—just real experience and direct answers.\n\nA couple days later, the recruiter reached out to give me the feedback call. They said:\n\n>\n\n**Bad news?** I didn’t get the job.  \n**Good news?** I made such a strong impression that the manager wanted to bring me on anyway—**in a completely new position that didn’t exist.**\n\nThey literally created a new **role**, adjacent to the original one I applied for, just to bring me in. No public posting, no backup list. Just a straight-up “let’s figure out how to make this work.”\n\n# Here’s why I’m sharing this:\n\nSometimes not getting the job doesn’t mean you failed.  \nIt means that role wasn’t built for you—but that doesn’t mean *you* didn’t make an impact.\n\nIf you show up clear, focused, and ready? The right manager will notice. And sometimes, they’ll do more than just say “we’ll keep in touch.”  \nThey’ll build the door you were supposed to walk through.\n\nI know this occurrence is rare but things can happen, people can open doors for you. Im proof it can and i'll even add something else, im not super special or anything like that. I just conveyed my experience the best way i could during the interview and tied past experiences to what they were looking for and got lucky for sure. Keep applying guys dont give up!",

I'm currently bootstrapping a lifestyle-sized small software product for SMBs. \n\n**Point of this post:** I'm giving my two cents about how to think of your career in software and whether it is at risk from AI.\n\n**Part 1: the hierarchy of employment**\n\nI think of all jobs, including in software, as falling into three categories:\n\n1. Task-oriented: your day-to-day revolves around completing tasks assigned to you. If you're working at a cafe, that might mean \"clean the tables\" or \"make coffee.\" If you're a SWE, that might mean \"change the button color palette from blues to purples according to the design system.\" Being good at this means you're known for clearing Jira queues quickly and nobody has to clean up after you or redo work you said you did.\n2. Project-oriented: you're given projects to complete but the details and methods are up to you. If you're working at a cafe, it could be \"make sure the pastries are refreshed every two hours.\" If you're a software engineer, it could be \"implement the new design system.\" Being good at this means you can be trusted to deliver a feature that may have multiple ways of completing it while balancing trade-offs, on time. This often requires delegation. I'm at this level right now.\n3. Outcome-oriented: you own an outcome. That's often quantified in terms of money or a money-adjacent metric. If you're at a cafe, it can be increasing the number of baked goods sold with coffee orders. If you're in software (you may not be actively coding at this level), it may be \"increase conversions from large enterprise clients on the landing page.\" Being good at this means being known as someone who can make products grow revenue and/or profit. I'm upgrading to this level by bootstrapping a business - even if I fail, I will have owned an outcome.\n\nIn both coffee and software examples, notice that these are different roles on the same project. Notice also that I focus on \"being known as,\" which is the most important thing in career stability and progression.\n\nAlmost everyone typically starts on level 1. It's unusual and incredibly risky to stay at level 1, and you have to be constantly adapting and learning new technologies to pull it off. You want to graduate to level 2 as soon as possible**,** ideally within 2 years. Few people make it to level 3, it's normally OK to stay at level 2. Level 2 makes more than level 1 within the same company/skillset (of course a PM at Walmart might make less than an AI engineer at OpenAI). Level 3 has unbounded pay. \n\n**How to move levels**\n\nI am by no means a great authority on getting promoted, I tend to get distracted and chase my own goals. But from talking to people who are good at it, there are two things you need to do:\n\n1. Be really good at your current job band: if you're level 1, your manager knows that when they give you a task, it will be done when you say it will be done, it will be done to the highest reasonable standards, and nobody is going to have to clean up after you.\n2. Know your manager's goals and align your work to them. Find ways to make them look better and achieve their goals. Show you care.\n\nOf course, there are more cynical factors, like being liked and having a good attitude. Finally, your self-conception is important. If you think of yourself as \"a guy who makes Spring Boot apps\" you'll be stuck in level 1 longer than if you think of yourself as \"a guy who delivers backend services.\" PG has a great essay about keeping your self-characterization loose but I can't find it right now.\n\n  \n**Part 2: What AI means for you**\n\nAI is decently good at doing a lot of level 1 work. If you counted on being the gatekeeper of button colors as the reason for why you can't be fired, that's not going to work anymore. In fact, if you counted on being the gatekeeper of anything, that's unlikely to keep working. \n\nThat being said, level 1 is always risky. If you were a really good JQuery developer who could complete any task in that language, the rise of frameworks like React threatened your job. Not right away as your company might need you for their existing code, but the reduced demand for JQuery devs would lessen your bargaining power and the increased support and flood of React developers would make switching stacks increasingly attractive to your employer. Any major technology shift is a threat to level 1 operators.\n\nThe difference with AI, however, is that it's happening across all technologies at once. The goal is what's being automated, not just the method. AI can write basic software in any language. You can't switch from owning button colors in JQuery to owning button colors in React or whatever the next tech is, you have to upgrade what you can deliver.\n\nThere are tasks that AI can't do because it's not smart enough. If you're a staff engineer working on very complex problems you might be fine, but if you're part of the 90% that do various versions of the same thing that everyone else does, your job is at risk once the Devins of the world nail their product and user experience.\n\nThe good news is that it's also a resource that you can use:\n\n1. If you're currently task-oriented, use AI to be really good at completing tasks fast and well. Do this by focusing on the \"well.\" AI is already really fast compared to you, so don't try to go faster. Plan first, think what kind of testing you need, both automated and manual, and what the deployment story will look like\n2. Now that you know the hierarchy of employment, focus on graduating to the next band by understanding the context in which you're given tasks, talking to your lead, and making their project happen faster and better\n\n**Why AI is not a threat to bands 2 and 3**\n\nOwning a project requires taste. AI doesn't have taste yet, and I doubt it will develop it. The main difference between owning tasks and owning a project is thinking through tradeoffs, understanding how this project fits and what its goals are, and making a plan that aligns the tradeoffs with the goals. AI can be very helpful as an assistant in doing this, but it requires the person doing it to already know what the options are and what the goals are. This is not the case for basic feature development.\n\nLevel 3 is safe first because it's the decision makers who aren't going to fire themselves, and second because it requires even more intuition and experience than AI has access to. More importantly, it requires accountability, which is one of the main barriers to using AI.",

And getting the programs to run correctly was always so satisfying. In school we used Python and C so I am pretty proficient in those, and then recently ive taken a React.js course but not too into that yet, but I loved the whole concept of seeing my code work in real-time.\n\n  \nI am currently in a DevOps like role, working with Microsoft Azure supporting some products for a pretty huge company (but not a tech company). I really do not do much at my job, just like cloud optimization and monitoring, fixing some pipeline errors, etc. This is not interesting at all to me, I also feel like I will be getting let go soon because of lack of work and layoffs that have happened and probably will continue to happen. I use Python to automate some things at my job, using the Azure clients to access info and pull it out, and thats enjoyable, I work with ChatGPT for those because its really easy to bang out programs like that. I've expressed an interest in switching to SWE to my managers but it doesn't seem like there's much opportunity to because of offshoring and layoffs, and we are potentially moving away from building products in house. \n\n  \nI've been applying to SWE roles, Product Manager, Solution Architect/Engineer, and other roles, have applied to over 60 jobs now (all entry-level as I've only been at my job for 6-7 months) and I have not gotten a single interview. Not even a coding test, nothing. Everyday I wake up to a new rejection email. I feel stuck at my job where I don't do much, I want to work at a tech company where I can be working with new technology and innovation hands on but it just doesn't seem like I can even get a new job.

One is a super strong programmer who is a lead contributor to a few different projects. He is essential to them.\n\nThe other really contributes to only one, but it is a high demand one. He constantly has work. And it's work where it is difficult to replace him with.\n\nI've been as long as him in the company, but I only contribute tasks here and there across a few projects. I'm not a super impactful developer. This isn't imposter syndrome or being self loathing, I can't say I'm super essential to my team.\n\nThere is one project I was hired for and I've done things for it, but lately there hasn't been any demands, so I'm just contributing.\n\nMy strategy is to observe and understand better what the people across my team do so I can do more than I currently do. I also need to keep delivering on what I currently have and having a good relationship with my boss so I can get lobby for more impactful new features or projects i have ownership over",

I have fallen in love with programming. I always loved computers but programming seemed so daunting until I just decided to dive head first into it and I’ve loved every second of it. However, I’m worried about job opportunities. I hear horror stories about how over saturated the industry is with programmers and the lack of jobs. People who go through their whole degree just to end up working at McDonalds for years after college. Is this actually an issue or do people over exaggerate and cherry pick certain stories? ",

        "content": "I am extremely fortunate to have receive an offer for a Project Manager role at a tech company. My current role is a mid-level SWE with 5-6years of experience. I am fully remote, work maybe 15hours a week, our tech stack is incredibly outdated and code standards are non existent. My base/TC is $105k/$115k. I live a very comfortable life. I go surfing in the afternoons, have sleep overs with my girlfriend and work together the next day, can take trips whenever I want, have moved temporarily to a bunch of different cities etc.\n\nFor the last year or so i've craved a new role, challenge and life experience because frankly being alone most of my week and not having stimulating work has gotten to me. I wanted to move away from SWE and go into a PM role. Well lucky me, I finally got everything I was asking for but now i'm unsure. The new role is hybrid(3days) in Los Angeles and base/tc is $145k/$180-200k. The TC includes options that vest over 6 years with a cliff at 3 so realistically I will be locked in for three years if I took the offer. I will obviously be working more hours than I am used too and i'd have to move away from my gf, friends and beach. I currently live in a beach town in OC where I can surf in 5minutes, my gf is 10min away and my friends are 20min away. Based on my research, there is no good place I could move that would optimize the commute time between the three main locations. If I moved closer to LA but still in OC I would still be an hour away from LA and an hour away from my gf/friends. If I moved to LA I would be close to work but far from the beach, gf and friends. If I lived in LA, I realistically would only be able to surf on weekends because even on my remote days it would be an hour to beach and an hour or more back.\n\nSince I got my remote job, i've been living my life in a way that maximized my happiness and have had that mindset since. Like I said, lately i've wanted a change but now that the change is in front of me, it is frightening to me. What should I do?",

I am full remote, 40 hours per week on the dot, and acting team lead. It pays decent and is steady, the lifestyle is great.\n\nI'm in my mid 30s and won't be able to easily afford a house in LA. I see salary ranges of 70-250K in So Cal. The company is small and I don't get to network, I'm not doing PD in my free time. Truthfully tried a few different careers before this one and am a bit burned out on grinding.\n\nMy ambitions are to go the software architect route or try and start my own software shop. I'm concerned I'm stagnating or writing garbage code that I'm unaware of it because the company is so small and the other dev takes full advantage of not being watched and checks out. I'm writing 90% of the code and I like it that way, but I am concerned abouth lack of PD and lack of career path at this company. I've been weighing asking for a promotion + 15% raise but don't know if that is tacky\n\nEDIT: I did some research, which I should have done. I appreciate the commentary and I have been reflecting on this. \n\n Glassdoor claims that the median total pay in LA Is 130K per year. I am unsure if that is correct. \n\nI suppose I am paid okay but not great for an average developer, and if I want to earn more, then I need to grind a bit and focus on higher paying jobs that will demand more, perhaps outside LA.

It made me realize that for the past two years of college, I’ve been in autopilot mode. I completed assignments and passed classes, but I feel like I never deeply learned or retained the fundamentals of programming and cs theory.\n\nDespite that, the company surprisingly invited me to do a 90-minute follow-up whiteboarding session. I really want to redeem myself and prep properly. The task involves working on a Java project live, identifying bad coding practices, improving the code, and explaining my reasoning — kind of like a debugging/design/code-improvement challenge. I want to take this chance but I'm also nervous about embarrassing myself lol.\n\nMy issue is I feel like I’ve forgotten everything: syntax, core concepts, how to think like an engineer. I also struggle with memory/brain fog, so I tend to Google even basic things — but obviously that doesn’t work well in a live coding setting. Maybe I need a different approach to how I study code? When I do leetcode problems and such I do them but I don't know if they fully stick with me.\n\nAny advice or methods for how to quickly relearn and reinforce the fundamentals? Are there any structured courses or certs that helped you rebuild your CS foundation? Leetcode is helpful, but I feel like I need more than just solving problems — I need to understand why and how again.\n\nI know I might get some \"you're cooked\" comments, but I am really trying to get back into rhythm again.

        "content": "I'm honestly amazed this even needs to be said but if you're currently in a stable, low-drama, job especially outside of FAANG, just stay put because the grass that looks greener right now might actually be hiding a sinkhole\n\nLet me tell you about my buddy. Until a few months ago, he had a job as a software engineer at an insurance company. The benefits were fantastic.. he would work 10-20 hours a week at most, work was very chill and relaxing. His coworkers and management were nice and welcoming, and the company was very stable and recession proof. He also only had to go into the office once a week. He had time to go to the gym, spend time with family, and even work on side projects if he felt like it\n\nBut then he got tempted by the FAANG name and the idea of a shiny new title and what looked like better pay and more exciting projects, so he made the jump, thinking he was leveling up, thinking he was finally joining the big leagues\n\nFrom day one it was a completely different world, the job was fully on-site so he was back to commuting every day, the hours were brutal, and even though nobody said it out loud there was a very clear expectation to be constantly online, constantly responsive, and always pushing for more\n\nHe went from having quiet mornings and freedom to structure his day to 8 a.m. standups, nonstop back-to-back meetings, toxic coworkers who acted like they were in some competition for who could look the busiest, and managers who micromanaged every last detail while pretending to be laid-back\n\nHe was putting in 50 to 60 hours a week just trying to stay afloat and it was draining the life out of him, but he kept telling himself it was worth it for the resume boost and the name recognition and then just three months in, he got the layoff email\n\nNo warning, no internal transfer, no fallback plan, just a cold goodbye and a severance package, and now he’s sitting at home unemployed in a terrible market, completely burned out, regretting ever leaving that insurance job where people actually treated each other like human beings\n\nAnd the worst part is I watched him change during those months, it was like the light in him dimmed a little every week, he started looking tired all the time, less present, shorter on the phone, always distracted, talking about how he felt like he was constantly behind, constantly proving himself to people who didn’t even know his name\n\nHe used to be one of the most relaxed, easygoing guys I knew, always down for a beer or a pickup game or just to chill and talk about life, but during those months it felt like he aged five years, and when he finally called me after the layoff it wasn’t just that he lost the job, it was like he’d lost a piece of himself in the process\n\nTo make it worse, his old role was already filled, and it’s not like you can just snap your fingers and go back, that bridge is gone, and now he’s in this weird limbo where he’s applying like crazy but everything is frozen or competitive or worse, fake listings meant to fish for resumes\n\nI’ve seen this happen to more than one person lately and I’m telling you, if you’re in a solid job right now with decent pay, decent hours, and a company that isn’t on fire, you don’t need to chase the dream of some big tech title especially not in a market like this\n\nRight now, surviving and keeping your sanity is the real win, and that “boring” job might be the safest bet you’ve got\n\nBe careful out there",

This is my first time applying to jobs since I was in school, been an interesting experience overall and I’d love some thoughts on my situation\n\nCurrently making ~210k, on promo would expect ~260-270 but generally discontent at work and would like a change\n\nI’ve been fortunate with applications, I’m considering the following two offers:\n\nCoinbase:  ~235k TC, plus 25k sign-on\n\nStartup:\n- Utilities sector, 100 employees, founded in 2023\n- Just received 200 million in series B funding\n- 175k TC, about 40k of which is in equity \n- In office\n\nCoinbase pros:\n- Higher immediate comp, safer\n- Remote\n- Better WLB\n- I’ve been entertaining a move to a higher COL area, and Coinbase would adjust salary for that. Not positive I want to move yet, otherwise this would be the deciding factor\n\nStartup pros:\n- Higher potential payout\n- More exciting\n- Feel more valued by the company, more upward mobility \n- Great office vibe\n\nIf the startup hits series C, comp would pull slightly ahead of CB. Any further growth would expand that lead. I’ve done my research and feel good about the growth potential, but there’s always the risk it doesn’t pan out, especially with the current economic situation.\n\nOne reason I decided to look at other jobs was my company returning to office 5 days a week. The commute sucks and I’m not a fan of the office. So remote sounds nice. That said, the startup is walkable, and I actually loved the vibe during my visits for interviews.\n\nI do have to be honest, I don’t push myself as hard working remote, and I think working in an office would boost my output/career growth\n\nInitially, I was leaning heavily toward CB, but the startup has been persistent, and I feel very valued by them. I’ve had direct calls from both the CTO and CEO telling me what a great fit they thought I was for the position and how much they’d love to have me join. Fairly personal each time so it’s felt authentic. Guess I’m not immune to flattery, because feeling so appreciated has me doubting my decision.\n\nI’d expect crazy hours from the startup, they’ve been transparent about expectations and it seems working late nights and weekends is not uncommon. I don’t prefer that, but if I really enjoy the work I think I’d be ok with it.\n\nI’m not sure how much I’m romanticizing the “fulfilling work/make more of an impact” aspect of the startup. My only experience has been with a big tech company, and the idea of working on something new without all the corporate song and dance seems refreshing.\n\nUltimately it’s a personal decision, but I’m hoping for some insight from people who’ve gone down either path.

Was it worth it, and how did you do it? I’m open to self-study or certifications—what should I focus on (e.g., AWS, Docker, CI/CD)?Thanks for any advice",

I just don't seem to have the tenacity to do this anymore, and with the oncoming of AI to shake things up, I'm not sure I ever will.\n\nIn any case, does anyone have any suggestions for career alternatives? May or or may not related to computer science. In my down time, I have been serving as a part-time rural carrier. To be honest, it has been rather appealing due to its isolation and it's system based on seniority. However, using this as a branch to transfer into USPS software careers does not appear to be working, as it seems many others had the same idea.\n\nThe ultimate question is where to go from here. With experience, a BS in EE, and soon-to-be Master's in CS, one would think I should have easy time getting a job, but to no avail.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\nI studied computer science, and during my final year at university, I started working as a student employee at a prestigious company. After graduating, I transitioned into a full-time role there as a C++ developer. After about a year, I left the software industry entirely to pursue a completely unrelated career path.\n\nAfter 1.5 years away, I’ve decided to return to software engineering. Since the beginning of university, I’ve always wanted to work in the field of computer graphics. Fortunately, I’ve been accepted into a reputable university to pursue a master’s degree focused on computer graphics.\n\nI have a few concerns and would appreciate any advice:\n\n\t1.\tThe market seems oversaturated since the end of the pandemic and with the rise of AI. While I have prior experience in software development, I haven’t worked specifically in graphics, and I also have a 1.5-year gap in the field due to switching careers. In this scenario, how difficult would it be for me to find a job after graduation?\n\n\t2.\tMy dream has always been to work at a big game studios, but salaries there aren’t always great. I’m also considering applying to MAANG companies. However, all the projects I’ll do during my master’s will be graphics-related. Would this kind of portfolio be a disadvantage when applying to MAANG companies?\n\n\t3.\tDoes age matter? Will companies still consider me even though there are younger candidates with perhaps more linear career paths?\n\nI’m not afraid of hard work and I’ve always been a top-performing student academically, but I have some doubts and would love to hear your thoughts and advice. Thanks in advance!",

I would love to work out of the Los Angeles office, which I marked as my first choice when applying. However, when I got the offer email, it stated that I could only choose from San Francisco or New York. \n\nHow likely/possible is it that I can request to have my internship location be in Los Angeles instead? If I were to get the return offer, how likely is it that I can choose which location to work out of for the full time position? \n\n  \nThank you so much for your help. ",
