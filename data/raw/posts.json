        "author": "SoloArtist91",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "My career has definitely taken a weird set of turns over the last few years to get me to end up where I have today. Initially, I started off building Tableau dashboards with datasets handed to me and things were good. After a while, I picked up Alteryx to better develop datasets meant specifically for Tableau reports. All good, no problems there. Eventually, I got hired at by a company to keep doing those two things, building reports and the workflows to support them.\n\n\nNow this company has had a lot of vendors in the past which means its data architecture and pipelines have spaghettied out of control even before I arrived. The company isn't a tech company, and there are a lot of boomers in it who can barely work Excel. It still makes a lot of money though, since it's primarily in the retail/sales space of luxury items. Once I took over, I've tried to do my best to keep things organized but it's a real mess. I should note that it's just me that manages these pipelines and databases, no one else really touches them. If there's ever a data question, they just ask me to figure it out.\n\n\nFast forward to earlier this year, and my bosses tell me that they want to me explore Azure, the cloud, and see if we can move our analytics ahead. I have spent hours researching and trying to learn as much as  I can. I created a Databricks instance and started writing notebooks to recreate some of the ETL processes that exist on our on-prem servers. I've definitely gotten more comfortable with writing code, databricks in general, and slowly understanding that world more, but the more I read online the more I feel like a total hack and fraud.\n\n\nI don't do anything with Git, I vaguely know that it's meant for version control but nothing past that. CI/CD is foreign to me. Unit tests, what are those? There are so many terms that I see in this subreddit that feel like complete jibberish to me, and I'm totally disheartened. How can I possibly bridge this gap? I feel like they gave me keys to a Ferrari and I've just been driving a Vespa up to this point. I do understand the concepts of data modeling, dim and fact tables, prod and dev, but I've never learned any formal testing. I constantly run into issues of a table updating incorrectly, or the numbers not matching between two reports, etc and I just fly by the seat of my pants. We don't have one source of truth or anything like that, the requirements constantly shift, the stakeholders constantly jump from one project to the other, it's all a big whirlwind.\n\n\nCan anyone else sympathize? What should I do? Hiring a vendor to come and teach me isn't an option, and I can't just quit to find something else, the market is terrible and I have another baby on the way. Like honestly, what the fuck do I do?",

        "author": "Q-U-A-N",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks,As part of the Apache Gravitino project, I’ve been contributing to what we call a **“catalog of catalogs”** – a unified metadata layer that sits on top of your existing systems. With 1.0 now released, I wanted to share why I think it matters for anyone in the Databricks / Snowflake ecosystem.\n\n**Where Gravitino differs from Unity Catalog by Databricks**\n\n* **Open & neutral**: Unity Catalog is excellent inside the Databricks ecosystem. And it was not open sourced until last year. Gravitino is Apache-licensed, open-sourced from day 1, and works across Hive, Iceberg, Kafka, S3, ML model registries, and more.\n* **Extensible connectors**: Out-of-the-box connectors for multiple platforms, plus an API layer to plug into whatever you need.\n* **Metadata-driven actions**: Define compaction/TTL policies, run governance jobs, or enforce PII cleanup directly inside Gravitino. Unity Catalog focuses on access control; Gravitino extends to automated actions.\n* **Agent-ready**: With the MCP server, you can connect LLMs or AI agents to metadata. Unity Catalog doesn’t (yet) expose metadata for conversational use.\n\n**What’s new in 1.0**\n\n* Unified access control with enforced RBAC across catalogs/schemas.\n* Broader ecosystem support (Iceberg 1.9, StarRocks catalog).\n* Metadata-driven action system (statistics + policy + job engine).\n* MCP server integration to let AI tools talk to metadata directly.\n\nHere’s a simplified architecture view we’ve been sharing:*(diagram of catalogs, schemas, tables, filesets, models, Kafka topics unified under one metadata brain)*\n\n**Why I’m excited** Gravitino doesn’t replace Unity Catalog or Snowflake’s governance. Instead, it complements them by acting as a **layer above multiple systems**, so enterprises with hybrid stacks can finally have one source of truth.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/apache/gravitino](https://github.com/apache/gravitino)\n\nWould love feedback from folks who are deep in Databricks or Snowflake or any other data engineering fields. What gaps do you see in current catalog systems?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6uqzj5n5csf1.png?width=2368&format=png&auto=webp&s=bab993cd44bc393cc8c3f1317c458fe872afbbb3",

I also had to evaluate the data quality.\n\nIt took me about half a day to learn the tech through tutorials and examples, and a couple of hours to find all the incomplete rows, missing rows, and duplicate rows. I then had to visit family for a week, so I only had a day to work on it.\n\nWhen I talked with the company again they praised my code and engineering, but they were disappointed that I didn’t use the physics article to find out which values are reasonable and then apply outlier detection, filters or something else to evaluate the output better.\n\nI was a bit taken aback because that would’ve required a lot more work for a take home project that I purposefully was not prepared for. I felt like I am not that good since I needed so much time to learn the tech and domain, but my friendstell me I dodged a bullet because if they expect this much from a take home project they would’ve worked me to the bone once I was on the payroll.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

The day after finishing my final bachelor’s exam, I joined a big tech company where I got the opportunity to work on Azure, SQL, and Power BI. I gained a lot of experience there. I used to work 16 hours a day with a tight schedule, but my productivity never dropped. However, as we all know, freshers usually get paid peanuts for the work they do.\n\nI wanted to complete one year there, and then I shifted to a startup company with a 100% hike, though with the same workload. At the startup, I got the opportunity to handle a Snowflake migration project, which made me really happy as Snowflake was booming at that time. I worked there for 1.3 years.\n\nWith the money and experience I gained, I achieved my dream of coming to the USA. I resigned, but since the project had a lot of dependencies, they requested me to continue for 3 more months, which I was happy to do.\nAnd by the god grace i was also worked as GA for 2 semester while doing my masters.\n\nNow, I have completed my master’s degree and am looking for a job, but it feels like nobody cares about my 3 years of experience in India. Most of my applications are directly rejected. It’s been 9 months, and I feel like I’m losing hope and even some of my knowledge and skills, as I keep applying for hundreds of jobs daily.\n\nAt this point, I want to restart, but I’m missing my consistency. I’m not sure whether I should completely focus on Azure, Python, Snowflake, or something else. Maybe I’m doing something wrong. \n",

So far, I’ve encountered several challenges that have made it difficult to get fully up to speed. Documentation is limited and inconsistent, with some scripts containing comments while others are over a thousand lines without any context. Communication is also spread across multiple messaging platforms, which makes it difficult to identify a single source of truth or establish consistent channels of collaboration.\n\nIn addition, I have not yet had the opportunity to shadow a full migration, which has limited my ability to see how the process comes together end to end. Team responsiveness has been inconsistent, and despite several requests to connect, I have had minimal interaction with my manager. Altogether, these factors have made onboarding less structured than anticipated and have slowed my ability to contribute at the level I would like.\n\nI’ve started applying again, but my question to anyone reading is whether this experience seems like an outlier or if it is more typical of the field, in which case I may need to adjust my expectations.",

        "content": "We’re setting up event tracking: 13 structured events covering the most important things, e.g. view\\_product, click\\_product, begin\\_checkout. This will likely grow to 27, 45, 53, ... event types because of tracking niche feature interactions. Volume-wise, we are talking hundreds of millions of events daily.\n\n2 pain points I'd love input on:\n\n1. Every event lands in its own table, but we are rarely interested in one event. Unioning all to create this sequence of events feels rough as event types grow. Is it? Any scalable patterns people swear by?\n2. We have no explicit link between events, e.g. views and clicks, or clicks and page loads; causality is guessed by joining on many fields or connecting timestamps. How is this commonly solved? Should we push back for source-sided identifiers to handle this?\n\nWe are optimizing for scalability, usability, and simplicity for analytics. Really curious about different perspectives on this.\n\n**EDIT:** To provide additional information, we do have a sessionId. However, within a session we still rely on timestamps for inference. \"Did this view lead to this click?\" Unlike an additional, common identifier between views and clicks specifically for example (like a hook that 1:1 matches both). I am wondering if the latter is common.\n\nAlso, we actually are plugging into existing solutions like Segment, RudderStack, Snowplow, Amplitude (one of them not all 4) that provides us the ability to create structured tracking plans for events. Every event defined in this plan currently lands as a separate table in BQ. It's then that we start to make sense of it, potentially creating one big table of them by unioning. Am I missing possibilities, e.g. having them land as one table in the first place? Does this change anything?",

I designed an architecture to store each setup, so results can be validated later and shared across departments. The company itself is only at the very early stages of building a data warehouse—there is not yet much awareness or culture around data-driven processes.\n\nThe challenge: every meeting feels like a struggle. From their perspective, they are unsure whether a database is necessary and would prefer to save each run in a separate file instead. But I cannot imagine handling 3,000 separate files—and if reruns are required, this could easily grow to 30,000 files, which would be impossible to manage effectively.\n\nOn top of that, they want to execute all runs over 30 days straight, without using any workflow orchestration tools like Airflow. To me, this feels unmanageable and unsustainable. Right now, my only thought is to let them experience it themselves before they see the need for a proper solution. What are your thoughts? How would you deal with it?",

        "content": "Hi, we're Alex and Kalan, the creators of Pontoon ([https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon)). Pontoon is an **open source, self-hosted, data export platform**. We built Pontoon from the ground up for the use case of shipping data products to enterprise customers. Check out our [demo ](https://app.storylane.io/share/onova7c23ai6)or try it out with docker [here](https://pontoon-data.github.io/Pontoon/getting-started/quick-start/).\n\nWhile at our prior roles as data engineers, we’ve both felt the pain of data APIs. We either had to spend weeks building out data pipelines in house or spend a lot on ETL tools like [Fivetran](https://www.fivetran.com/). However, there were a few companies that offered data syncs that would sync directly to our data warehouse (eg. Redshift, Snowflake, etc.), and when that was an option, we always chose it. This led us to wonder “**Why don’t more companies offer data syncs?**”. So we created Pontoon to be a platform that any company can self host to provide data syncs to their customers!\n\nWe designed Pontoon to be:\n\n* **Easily Deployed**: We provide a single, self-contained [Docker image](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon/pkgs/container/pontoon%2Fpontoon-unified)\n* **Support Modern Data Warehouses:** Supports Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, (we're working on S3, GGS)\n* **Multi-cloud**: Can send data from any cloud to any cloud\n* **Developer Friendly:** Data syncs can also be built via the API\n* **Open Source:** Pontoon is free to use by anyone\n\nUnder the hood, we use [Apache Arrow ](https://arrow.apache.org/)and [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy) to move data. Arrow has been fantastic, being very helpful with managing the slightly different data / column types between different databases. Arrow has also been really performant, averaging around 1 million records per minute on our benchmark.\n\nIn the shorter-term, there are several improvements we want to make, like:\n\n* Adding support for DBT models to make adding data models easier\n* UX improvements like better error messaging and monitoring of data syncs\n* More sources and destination (S3, GCS, Databricks, etc.)\n\nIn the longer-term, we want to make data sharing as easy as possible. As data engineers, we sometimes felt like second class citizens with how we were told to get the data we needed - “just loop through this api 1000 times”, “you probably won’t get rate limited” (we did), “we can schedule an email to send you a csv every day”. We want to change how modern data sharing is done and make it simple for everyone.\n\nGive it a try [https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon](https://github.com/pontoon-data/Pontoon) and let us know if you have any feedback.

Worst of all, everyone in your company heavily relies on data export for reporting. Unfortunately getting that data has been an agonizing process since *forever*. The timeline (give or take) has been something like this:\n\n**ODATA (circa 2017)**  \n\\- Paintfully slow and just plain stupid for any serious data export.  \n\\- Relies on *URLs* for paging..  \n\\- Completely unusable if you had more than toy-sized data.\n\n**BYOD (2017-2020)** “Bring Your Own Database” aka *Bring Your Own Pain.*  \n\\- No delta feed just brute-force emptied and inserted data again and again.  \n\\- Bogged down performance of the entire system while exports ran until batch servers were introduced. You had to stagger the timing of exports and run cleanup jobs.  \n\\- You could only export \"entities\" , custom tables required you to deploy packages.  \n\\- You had to manage everything (schema, indexes, perf, costs).\n\n**Export to Data Lake (2021–2023)**  \n\\- Finally, the least bad option. Just dumped CSV files into ADLS.  \n\\- You had to parse out the data using Synapse which was slow  \n\\- Not perfect, but at least it was predictable to build pipelines on. Eventually some delta functionality hacks were implemented.\n\n**Fabric (2023 → today)**  \n**-** Scrap all that, because FU. Everything must go into Fabric now:  \n\\- Missing columns, messed up enums, table schemas don't match, missing rows etc.  \n\\- **Forced** deprication of Export to Data Lake, alienating and enraging all their customers causing them to lose all trust, causing panic  \n\\- More expensive in every way, from data storage, to  parquet conversion  \n\\- Fabric still in alpha. Buggy as shit. Limited T-SQL scope. Fragile and can cause loss of data.  \n\\- A hopeless development team on the Microsoft payroll that don't solve anything and outright lie and pretend everything is working and that this is so much better than what we had before.\n\nIn practice, every few years an organization has to re-adapt their entire workflow. Rebuild reports, views and whatnot. Hundreds of hours of work. All of this because Microsoft refuses to allow access to production database or read-only replicas. To your own data.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "sparkenforce is a PySpark type annotation package that lets you specify and enforce DataFrame schemas using Python type hints.\n\n## What My Project Does\n\nWorking with PySpark DataFrames can be frustrating when schemas don’t match what you expect, especially when they lead to runtime errors downstream.\n\nsparkenforce solves this by:\n\n* Adding type annotations for DataFrames (columns + types) using Python type hints.\n* Providing a `@validate` decorator to enforce schemas at runtime for function arguments and return values.\n* Offering clear error messages when mismatches occur (missing/extra columns, wrong types, etc.).\n* Supporting flexible schemas with ..., optional columns, and even custom Python ↔ Spark type mappings.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nfrom sparkenforce import validate\nfrom pyspark.sql import DataFrame, functions as fn\n\n@validate\ndef add_length(df: DataFrame[\"firstname\": str]) -> DataFrame[\"name\": str, \"length\": int]:\n    return df.select(\n        df.firstname.alias(\"name\"),\n        fn.length(\"firstname\").alias(\"length\")\n    )\n```\n\nIf the input DataFrame doesn’t contain \"firstname\", you’ll get a `DataFrameValidationError` immediately.\n\n## Target Audience\n\n* PySpark developers who want stronger contracts between DataFrame transformations.\n* Data engineers maintaining ETL pipelines, where schema changes often breaks stuff.\n* Teams that want to make their PySpark code more self-documenting and easier to understand.\n\n## Comparison\n\n* Inspired by [dataenforce](https://github.com/CedricFR/dataenforce) (Pandas-oriented), but extended for PySpark DataFrames.\n* Unlike static type checkers (e.g. mypy), sparkenforce enforces schemas at runtime, catching real mismatches in Spark pipelines.\n* [spark-expectations](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/spark-expectations) has a wider aproach, tackling various data quality rules (validating the data itself, adding observability, etc.). sparkenforce focuses only on schema or structure data contracts.\n\n## Links\n\n* PyPI: [sparkenforce](https://pypi.org/project/sparkenforce/)\n* Source code: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/agustin-recoba/sparkenforce)\n* Demo notebook: [Examples](https://github.com/agustin-recoba/sparkenforce/blob/main/src/demo/demo_notebook.ipynb)",

With the goal that:\n\n1) She can continue to craft reports with AI having all data points readily available \n2) The reports can easily be plugged into the app’s reporting infrastructure \n\nAnother idea that they thought of that I didn’t think much of at first was to just copy her AI generated html into the app so it has a place to live for clients.\n\nMy biggest concerns are the AI not understanding our schema, what is available to use as far as validated functions, etc. Having to manage stuff offline vs in the app. Using this unnecessary big ass query.

        "content": "So, we have multiple dbt projects at my employer, one which has three environments (dev, stage and prod). The issue we're having is merging from the staging env to prod. For reference, in most of our other projects, we simply have dev and prod. Every branch gets tested and reviewed in a PR (we also have a CI environment and job that runs and checks to make sure nothing will break in Prod from changes being implemented) and then merged into a main branch, which is Production.   \n  \nA couple months back we implemented \"stage\" or a UAT environment for one of primary/largest dbt projects. The environment works fine the issue is that in git, once a developer's PR is reviewed and approved in dev and their code is merged into stage, it gets merged into a single stage branch in git.  \n  \nThis is somewhat problematic since we'll typically end up with a backlog of changes over time which all need to go to Prod, but not all changes are tested/UAT'd at the same time.   \nSo, you end up having some changes that are ready for prod while others are awaiting UAT review.   \nSince all changes in stage exist in a single branch, anything that was merged from dev to stage has to go to Prod all at once.   \nI've been trying to figure out if there's a way to \"cherry pick\" a handful of commits in the stage branch and merge only those to prod in a PR. A colleague suggested using git releases to do this functionality but that doesn't seem to be (based on videos I've watched) what we need.  \n  \nHow are people handling this type of functionality? Once your changes go to your stage/uat environment do you have a way of handling merging individual commits to production?    \n",

Especially for events that I'm not sure what params will be present, this will let me see everything present without any unknowns. The models will have an incremental load that add new columns on schema change - whenever a new param is introduced.\n\nDoes this approach seem sound?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey all,\n\nI've hit a wall on what seems like a core use case for the modern AWS data stack, and I'm hoping someone here has seen this specific failure mode before. I've been troubleshooting for days and have exhausted the official documentation.\n\nMy Goal (What I'm trying to achieve): An analyst logs into AWS via IAM Identity Center. They open our Amazon DataZone project (which uses the SageMaker Unified Studio interface). They run a SELECT * FROM customers query against a Redshift external schema. Lake Formation should intercept this and, based on their group membership, return only the 2 columns they are allowed to see (revenue and signup_date).\n\nThe Problem (The \"Smoking Gun\"): The user (analyst1) can log in and access the project. However, the system is behaving as if Trusted Identity Propagation (TIP) is completely disabled, even though all settings appear correct. I can prove this with two states: \n\n1.If I give the project's execution role (datazone_usr_role_...) SELECT in Lake Formation: The query runs, but it returns ALL columns. The user's fine-grained permission is ignored. \n\n2.If I revoke SELECT from the execution role: The query fails with TABLE_NOT_FOUND: Table '...customers' does not exist. The Data Explorer UI confirms the user can't see any tables. This proves Lake Formation is only ever seeing the service role's identity, never the end user's. \n\n\nThe Architecture: \n•Identity: IAM Identity Center (User: analyst1, Group: Analysts). \n•UI: Amazon DataZone project using a SageMaker Unified Domain. \n•Query Engine: Amazon Redshift with an external schema pointing to Glue. \n•Data Catalog: AWS Glue. \n•Governance: AWS Lake Formation. \n\nWhat I Have Already Done (The Exhaustive List): I'm 99% sure this is not a basic permissions issue. We have meticulously configured every documented prerequisite for TIP: \n\n•Created a new DataZone/SageMaker Domain specifically with IAM Identity Center authentication.\n•Enabled Domain-Level TIP: The \"Enable trusted identity propagation for all users on this domain\" checkbox is checked. \n•Enabled Project Profile-Level TIP: The Project Profile has the enableTrustedIdentityPropagationPermissions blueprint parameter set to True. \n•Created a NEW Project: The project we are testing was created after the profile was updated with the TIP flag. \n•Updated the Execution Role Trust Policy: The datazone_usr_role_... has been verified to include sts:SetContext in its trust relationship for the sagemaker.amazonaws.com principal. \n•Assigned the SSO Application: The Analysts group is correctly assigned to the Amazon SageMaker Studio application in the IAM Identity Center console. \n•Tried All LF Permission Combos: We have tried every permutation of Lake Formation grants to the user's SSO role (AWSReservedSSO_...) and the service role (datazone_usr_role_...). The result is always one of the two failure states described above.\n\nMy Final Question: Given that every documented switch for enabling Trusted Identity Propagation has been flipped, what is the final, non-obvious, expert-level piece of the puzzle I am missing? Is there a known bug or a subtle configuration in one of these places? \n•The Redshift external schema itself? \n•The DataZone \"Data Source\" connection settings? \n•A specific IAM permission missing from the user's Permission Set that's needed to carry the identity token? \n•A known issue with this specific stack (DataZone + Redshift + LF)?\n\nI'm at the end of my rope here and would be grateful for any insights from someone who has successfully built similar architecture.

        "author": "Norqj",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**TL;DR**: Open-source **declarative data infrastructure** for multimodal AI applications. Define what you want computed once, engine handles incremental updates, dependency tracking, and optimization automatically. Replace your vector DB + orchestration + storage stack with one `pip install`. Built by folks behind Parquet/Impala + ML infra leads from Twitter/Airbnb/Amazon and founding engineers of MapR, Dremio, and Yellowbrick.\n\nWe found that working with multimodal AI data sucks with traditional tools. You end up writing tons of imperative Python and glue code that breaks easily, tracks nothing, doesn't perform well without custom infrastructure, or requires stitching individual tools together.\n\n* What if this fails halfway through?\n* What if I add one new video/image/doc?\n* What if I want to change the model?\n\n**With Pixeltable you define what you want, engine figures out how:**\n\n    import pixeltable as pxt\n    \n    # Table with multimodal column types (Image, Video, Audio, Document)\n    t = pxt.create_table('images', {'input_image': pxt.Image})\n    \n    # Computed columns: define transformation logic once, runs on all data\n    from pixeltable.functions import huggingface\n    \n    # Object detection with automatic model management\n    t.add_computed_column(\n        detections=huggingface.detr_for_object_detection(\n            t.input_image,\n            model_id='facebook/detr-resnet-50'\n        )\n    )\n    \n    # Extract specific fields from detection results\n    t.add_computed_column(detections_labels=t.detections.labels)\n    \n    # OpenAI Vision API integration with built-in rate limiting and async management\n    from pixeltable.functions import openai\n    \n    t.add_computed_column(\n        vision=openai.vision(\n            prompt=\"Describe what's in this image.\",\n            image=t.input_image,\n            model='gpt-4o-mini'\n        )\n    )\n    \n    # Insert data directly from an external URL\n    # Automatically triggers computation of all computed columns\n    t.insert({'input_image': 'https://raw.github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable/release/docs/resources/images/000000000025.jpg'})\n    \n    # Query - All data, metadata, and computed results are persistently stored\n    results = t.select(t.input_image, t.detections_labels, t.vision).collect()\n\n**Why This Matters Beyond Computer Vision and ML Pipelines:**\n\nSame declarative approach works for agent/LLM infrastructure and context engineering:\n\n    from pixeltable.functions import openai\n    \n    # Agent memory that doesn't require separate vector databases\n    memory = pxt.create_table('agent_memory', {\n        'message': pxt.String,\n        'attachments': pxt.Json\n    })\n    \n    # Automatic embedding index for context retrieval\n    memory.add_embedding_index(\n        'message', \n        string_embed=openai.embeddings(model='text-embedding-ada-002')\n    )\n    \n    # Regular UDF tool\n    @pxt.udf\n    def web_search(query: str) -> dict:\n        return search_api.query(query)\n    \n    # Query function for RAG retrieval\n    @pxt.query\n    def search_memory(query_text: str, limit: int = 5):\n        \"\"\"Search agent memory for relevant context\"\"\"\n        sim = memory.message.similarity(query_text)\n        return (memory\n                .order_by(sim, asc=False)\n                .limit(limit)\n                .select(memory.message, memory.attachments))\n    \n    # Load MCP tools from server\n    mcp_tools = pxt.mcp_udfs('http://localhost:8000/mcp')\n    \n    # Register all tools together: UDFs, Query functions, and MCP tools  \n    tools = pxt.tools(web_search, search_memory, *mcp_tools)\n    \n    # Agent workflow with comprehensive tool calling\n    agent_table = pxt.create_table('agent_conversations', {\n        'user_message': pxt.String\n    })\n    \n    # LLM with access to all tool types\n    agent_table.add_computed_column(\n        response=openai.chat_completions(\n            model='gpt-4o',\n            messages=[{\n                'role': 'system', \n                'content': 'You have access to web search, memory retrieval, and various MCP tools.'\n            }, {\n                'role': 'user', \n                'content': agent_table.user_message\n            }],\n            tools=tools\n        )\n    )\n    \n    # Execute tool calls chosen by LLM\n    from pixeltable.functions.anthropic import invoke_tools\n    agent_table.add_computed_column(\n        tool_results=invoke_tools(tools, agent_table.response)\n    )\n    \n    etc..\n\nNo more manually syncing vector databases with your data. No more rebuilding embeddings when you add new context. What I've shown:\n\n* **Regular UDF**: `web_search()` \\- custom Python function\n* **Query function**: `search_memory()` \\- retrieves from Pixeltable tables/views\n* **MCP tools**: `pxt.mcp_udfs()` \\- loads tools from MCP server\n* **Combined registration**: `pxt.tools()` accepts all types\n* **Tool execution**: `invoke_tools()` executes whatever tools the LLM chose\n* **Context integration**: Query functions provide RAG-style context retrieval\n\nThe LLM can now choose between web search, memory retrieval, or any MCP server tools automatically based on the user's question.\n\n**Why does it matter?**\n\n* **Incremental processing** \\- only recompute what changed\n* **Automatic dependency tracking** \\- changes propagate through pipeline\n* **Multimodal storage** \\- Video/Audio/Images/Documents/JSON/Array as first-class types\n* **Built-in vector search** \\- no separate ETL and Vector DB needed\n* **Versioning & lineage** \\- full data history tracking and operational integrity\n\n**Good for**: AI applications with mixed data types, anything needing incremental processing, complex dependency chains\n\n**Skip if**: Purely structured data, simple one-off jobs, real-time streaming\n\nWould love feedback/2cts! Thanks for your attention :)\n\n**GitHub**: [https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable](https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable)",

        "content": "Dear community\n\nI work on a factsheet-like report which shall be distributed via PDF and therefore I chose Power BI Report Builder which works great for pixel perfect print optimized reports. For PBI Report Builder and my report design in general it is best to work with flat tables. The input comes from various Excel files and I process them with Python in our Lakehouse. That works great. The output column structure is like this:\n\n- Hierarchy level 1 (string)\n- Hierarchy level 2 (string)\n- Attribute group (string)\n- Attribute (string)\n- Value (mostly integers some strings)\n\nFor calculations in the report it is best to have the value column only being integers. However, some values cannot be expressed as number and are certain keywords instead stored as strings. I thought about having a value_int and value_str column to solve this.\n\nDo you have any tips or own experiences? I'm relatively new to data transformations and maybe not aware of some more advanced concepts.\n\nThanks!\n",

        "content": "Because I think I would like to do that.\n\nI like looking at data, though I no longer work professionally in a data analytics or data engineering role. However, I still feel like I could bring value in that area, on a fraction scale. I wonder if there is a role like a Data QA Analyst as a sidehustle/fractional role.\n\nMy plan is to pitch the idea that I will write the analytics code that evaluates the quality of data pipelines every day. I think in day-to-day DE operation, the tests folks write are mostly about pipeline health. With everyone integrating AI-based transformation, there is value in having someone test the output.\n\nSo, I was wondering if data quality analysis is even a thing? I think this is not a role to have someone entirely dedicated to full-time, but rather someone familiar with the feature or product to data analytics test code and look at data.\n\nMy plan is to:\n- Stare the at the data produced from DE operations\n- Come up with different questions and tests cases\n- Write simple code for those tests cases\n- And flag them to DE or production side\n\n\nWhen I was doing web scraping work, I used to write operations that simply scraped the data. Whenever security measures were enforced, the automation program I used was smart enough to adapt - utilizing tricks like fooling captchas or rotating proxies. However, I have recently learned that in flight ticket data scraping, if the system detects a scraping operation in progress, premiums are dynamically added to the ticket prices. They do not raise any security measures, but instead corrupt the data from the source.\n\nIf you are running a large-scale data scraping operation, it is unreasonable to expect the person doing the scraping to be aware of these issues. The reality is that you need someone to develop an test case that can monitor pricing data volatility to detect abnormalities. Most Data Analysts simply take the data provided by Data Engineers at face value and do not conduct a thorough analysis of it and nor should they.\n\nBut then again, this is just an idea. Please let me know what you think. I might pitch this idea to my employer. I do not need a two-day weekend, just one day is enough.",

        "content": "TL;DR\nI know enough about Python and SQL upto Joins but no standard database knowledge all through Chatgpt/Gemini and screwing up with some data that was handed to me. I want to learn more about other tools as well as using cloud. Have no industry experience per se and would love some advice on how to get to a level of building reliable pipelines for real world use. I havent used a single Apache tool, just theoretical knowledge and YT. Thats how bad it is.\n\n\nHi everyone, \n\nIm ngl this thread alone has taught me so much for the work I've done. Im a self taught programmer (~4 years now). I started off with Python had absolutely no idea about SQL (still kinda don't). \n\nWhen I started to learn programming (~2021) I had just finished uni with Bio degree and I began to take keen interest into it as my thesis was based on computational simulation of binding molecules and I was heavily limited by the software GUI which my lecturer showed me could have been much more efficient using Python. Hence, began my journey. I started off learning HTML, CSS and JS (that alone killed my interest for a while), but then I stumbled onto Python. Keep in mind late 2020 to early 2021 had a massive hype of online ML courses and thats how I forayed into the world of Python.\n\nGiven its high-level and massive community made it easier to understand a lot of concepts and it has a library for the most random shit you'd wanna not code yourself. However, I have realized my biggest limiting factor was:\n\n1. Tutorial Hell\n2. Never knowing if I know enough? (Primarily because of not having any industry experience with SQL and Git, as well as QA with unit testing/TDD. These were just concepts I've about).\n\nTo put it frankly I was/am extremely underconfident of being able to build reliable code that can be used in the real world. \n\nBut I have a very stubborn attitude and for better or for worse that has pushed me. My Python knowledge and my subject expertise gave me an advantage to quickly understand high level ML/DL topics to train and experiment with models, but I always enjoyed data engineering i.e., building the pipelines that feed the right data to AI.\n\nBut I constantly feel like I am lacking. I started small[ish] since last December. MY mom runs a small cafe but we struggled to keep track of financials. Few reasons being, barebones POS system, with a basic analytics dashboard, handwritten inventory tracking, no accurate insights from sales through delivery partners. \nI initially thought I could just export the excel files and clean and analyze it in Python. But there were a lot of issues and so I picked up Postgres (open-source few!) with the basics (upto Joins, I use CTEs cause for the life of me I don't see myself using views etc.). The data totals up i.e., from all data sources to ~100k rows. I used sqlalchemy to pushed the cleaning datasets to a postgres database and I used duckdb for in memory transformations to build the fact tables (3 of them for the orders, items, and added financial expenses).\n\nThis was way more tedious than Ive explained. Primarily due to a lot of issues like duplicated invoice no.s (the POS system was restarted this year on the advice of my mom, but thats another story for another day), basically no definitive primary key (created a composite key with the date), the delivery partners order ids are not shown in the same report as the master report, and so on. Without getting much into detail,\n\n\nHere is my current situation and why I have asked this question on this thread:\n\nI was using Gemini to help me structure the Python code I wrote in my notebook and write the SQL queries (only to realize it was not upto the mark so I pretty much wrote 70% of the CTE myself) and used duckdb engine to query the data from the staging tables directly into a fact table. But I learnt all these terminologies because of Gemini. I just didnt share any financial data with it which is probably why it gave me the garbage[ish] query. But the point being I learnt that. I was setting the data types configs using Pandas and I didn't create any tables in SQL it was directly mapped by SQLalchemy.\n\nThen I came across dimension tables, data marts, etc. I feel like I am damn close and I can pick this up but the learning feels extremely ad hoc and I keep doubting my existing code infrastructure a lot.\n\nSo my question is should I continue to learn like this (making a ridiculously insane amount of mistake only to realize there are existing theories on how to model data, transform data, etc., later on). Or is it wise to actually take on a certification course? I also have zero actual cloud knowledge (have just tinkered with BigQuery on Googles Cloud skill boos courses)\n\nAs much as it frustrates me I love seeing data coming together like to provide useful, viable information as an output. But I feel like my knowledge is my limitation.\n\nI would love to hear your inputs, personal experiences, book reccos (I am a better visual learner tbh). Most of what I can find have very basic intros to Python, SQL, etc. and yes I can always be better with my basics but if I start off like and get bored I know I am going to slack off and never finish the course.\n\nI think weirdly I am asking people to rate my level (cant believe im seeking validation on a data engg thread) and suggest any good learning sources. \n\nFYI If you have read it through from the start till here. Thank you and I hope all your dreams come true! Cuz you're a legend!",

It has weird quirks with it's autogenerated revisions, nullability and other updating aspects. The most annoying issue being that its autogenerated revision file for updates is always just creating every table again, which we haven't been able to solve, so we just have to write it ourselves every time.\n\nWe use Microsoft SQL Server for our DB if that makes any difference.

Some even, perhaps, hyper optimize to such a degree that it leads to analysis paralysis and then they eventually quit programming as a whole.\n\nSo, how did the early guys do it? There was no Reddit (or forums) back then. So did you hyper optimize your learning path or were you like \"let's pick a book and start doing\"? How did you manage to learn a programming language (or programming in general) when there was no web (or perhaps when there weren't so many courses on Python, C, C++, Java, and Assembly)?\n\nNot trying to put anyone down (that applies to both the younger and the older generation). I'm just curious. I know this question has probably been asked at an earlier point in time. But I wanted to get the current perspective for people who are trying to learn in 2025.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I felt like my degree didn't really set me up for success when it came to actual helpdesk things and I was struggling pretty substantially.\n\nLate 2023, I went back to school for full-stack development. I was told last month that I'm at my federal loan limit so I was forced to leave school. Now I'm enrolled in [boot.dev](http://boot.dev) and I'm also going to do a free Harvard course.\n\nI'm just anxious that this is a waste of time. I'm starting so late in life, and I won't have any official programming degrees, and I'm worried about AI replacing work in the tech industry by the time I'm finished learning.\n\nI guess I'd like to hear stories from people in similar situations for a little encouragement. I want to hear from other self-taught people who were able to land good jobs. I want to hear the challenges they experienced, and suggestions on what they'd do if they had to do it again.\n\nI'm working on building my linkedin network, but aside from just joining groups and connecting with people, I'm not sure what else I can do to boost my profile. I know in the corporate world, connections are a big part of finding a good job.\n\n  \nEdit! Thank you everyone for your responses! I've learned that this isn't something I should pursue, especially since I'm not good at helpdesk and I won't have a CS degree. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't wasting time and money trying to learn something that won't help me succeed, so I greatly appreciate the insightful comments! On to the next best conquest haha!",

        "content": "This is driving me crazy. I’ll spend 2 hours watching a React tutorial, follow along perfectly, even build the project. Then the next day when I try to implement something similar… blank. Like I never watched it.\n\nStarted digging into why this happens and apparently there’s a name for it - the “forgetting curve.” Some German psychologist figured out we lose about 70% of new info within 24 hours. Fun.\n\nHere’s what I think is happening with programming tutorials specifically:\nWe’re basically just watching someone else code. It feels like learning because we can follow along, but our brains aren’t actually doing the heavy lifting. It’s like watching someone lift weights and thinking you got stronger.\n\nMost tutorials also cram way too much into one session. I counted - the last Next.js tutorial I watched introduced 12 different concepts in 45 minutes. No wonder my brain tapped out.\nAnd we never go back. We watch once, maybe take some notes, then move on to the next shiny tutorial. But memory doesn’t work that way.\n\nSo I’ve been experimenting with some stuff that actually seems to help:\nAfter watching a section, I pause and try to write down everything I remember without looking. Painful but effective.\n\nI also try to explain concepts out loud like I’m teaching someone. Sounds dumb but it forces you to actually understand vs just recognize.\n\nThe biggest thing though - I go back to my notes after a few days. Not rewatching the video, just testing myself on what I wrote down. Then again after a week.\n\nIt’s more work upfront but I’m actually remembering stuff now instead of just collecting bookmarks.\n\nAnyone else struggle with this? What do you do to actually retain what you learn from tutorials?",

        "content": "# Tips\n\nDon't fall into the trap of looking for the \"perfect resource\", just pick one and be consistent with it. You will learn much more by finishing any course than trying to constantly jump to a better one.\n\n# Lecture Based\n\nThese are classes offered by universities (Harvard, MIT, Helsinki, etc). The structure is a weekly lecture given a professor, an assigned reading, and a problem set.\n\nThey are generally self-paced. Some will grade your submissions, and some will even give you a certificate of completion, it's not worth much, but it can be motivating.\n\n**Harvard CS50** and friends (CS50P, CS50 AI, etc) — These serve as general introductions. They have been taken by thousand and are high quality. CS50 teaches you the basics of *C* (Week 1-5), *Python* (week 6), *SQL* (week 7), and finally some *HTML* with *Flask*. CS50P (Python) is similar but focuses on Python only, you cover the basics (conditionals, loops, exception, libraries, testing, I/O, and some OOP). If you sign up through EdX you can track your progress.\n\n# Text Based\n\nThese courses are mostly text based, you read through a module then go practice an assignment.\n\nPopular courses include: The Odin Project, FullStack Open, FreeCodeCamp, and Code Academy.\n\n**The Odin Project** teaches you the basics of Web Development. The first part focuses on HTML, CSS, and JS. Then splits into either FullStack JS (React, Node, Express) or Fullstack Rails (React, Ruby). The final module offers tips on getting hired. They have a big discord community.\n\n**Fullstack Open** is another high quality resource focused on Web Development. It starts with the the basics of HTML & CSS, before quickly jumping into React. The next modules show you to work with NodeJS and express to build a backend.\n\n# Books\n\nI'm a big fan books, anything from **O'Reilly**, **Manning**, or **Starch Press** is usually solid.\n\nBooks like *Automate the Boring stuff with Python* are often recommended, you can download it for free.\n\nI learned C, C++, and Rust from books, ex: *Effective C*, *C++ Crash Course*, *The Rust Book*\n\n# Interactive\n\n**Scrimba** & **Bootdev** are websites that have interactive exercises, they follow a freemium model where some content is free, but you have to pay to unlock everything. I tired Scrimba and I was pretty impressed.\n\n# Others\n\n**100Devs** is another popular community with a large discord channel. The course is a series of videos by Leon Noel, there are weekly streams and weekly hours.\n\n**Udemy** — ex: **100 days of Code by Angela Yu**. This is a very popular course that focuses on building 1 python project per day, you start off with a Blackjack app, then Snake Game, parsing CSV data, building UI with Python, using a SQL db, using Flask, Git, etc. *This one is not free, you have to pay.*\n\n**PluralSight** *—* Pretty good quality, has courses on most technologies. It's how I learned Docker, React, Angular, and a few others.\n\nNo links due to Reddit Filters",

It also uses SQLite database that can realistically handle up to a million files, and FAISS for indexing.\n\nIt’s not production-ready yet, and it gets a bit buggy when stress-tested, but the core features are there and working as intended. I’ve put a lot of time into it and learned a ton, but I know I’m missing real-world experience — like working with a team, writing scalable code, and having people who actually know what they’re doing point out where I’m going wrong.\n\nI’m hoping to land an internship to gain that experience and also earn a bit to help pay for my tuition fees as I'm only 2 years into my CS journey as a student. Do you think a project like this is enough to get my foot in the door? Has anyone here landed an internship based on a personal project or PoC? How did you pitch it, and what did you focus on?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts or advice!",

I do stuff with the HTML canvas and enjoy that, but Flash was much more robust.\n\nWhenever I'd have like an IT person telling me that Flash sucked I would automatically think \"Well, they clearly do not know what they are talking about.\" Their criticism is about security and performance issues. It's a valid criticism. Flash had a lot of vulnerabilities because it gave freedom to the software engineer.

        "author": "tree332",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "\n\nI have been really struggling at times with the advice to just learn programming by jumping into projects.\n\nI have to think inductively and I am not fully prepared, even when I feel I have done my best to memorize, but I must not be doing enough to memorize. Only until I can recite every fact mentioned to me in the slide and more am I ready for the exam, or even my homework.\n\nAt the very least, trying to memorize all the given axioms(definitions, rules, properties, relationships)\n\ngives you a vernacular to communicate confusion with a practice problem more clearly than “I don’t know where to start. I don’t get this.”\n\n\n\nthe problem is when I also don’t know what exactly to memorize, such as in programming which can be more laissez faire in teaching, you are told to just start coding in order to learn.  When I tried to look into whether I should take ‘intermediate’ and ‘advanced’ intro to x programming language courses online at the very least to develop more vocabulary to google implementation and debug effectively, I saw comments such as these:\n\n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lj1ay9/stem\\_student\\_here\\_should\\_i\\_master\\_one\\_programming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lj1ay9/stem_student_here_should_i_master_one_programming/)\n\nDon't focus on languages. Think of something fun (database, web app, data science project, whatever), research what languages fit the use case and just build it. Nothing beats the skills you gather from solving your own problems and they will mostly be transferrable to other technologies later on.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID, if you really want to get deep into understanding programming languages from the ground up, get yourself a copy of \"C - A modern approach\" (K. N. King, available on the internet archive for free). It will teach you the most fundamental of all programming languages, C, but almost more importantly: You will understand every other language afterwards more easily, especially a lot of design decisions in C++, Java, Rust and many more.\n\nIt has little exercises and some larger programming projects in it to directly apply the stuff you read about. The book might seem intimidating at 800 pages, but it's actually a rather swift read, there are just a lot of examples and additional explanations.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1f7rhs9/how\\_to\\_learn\\_advanced\\_python/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1f7rhs9/how_to_learn_advanced_python/)\n\n\n\nOP, everyone so far except the duck saxophone guy is giving you shitty advice.\n\nYou already know decorators exist. You've never used them. Do you think reading about other things that also exist will help you learn how to use them?\n\nDon't read a thing. **If you want to learn advanced programming, start working on an advanced project**. Aim too high.\n\nWhen you can't figure out how to do something or think that there must be an easier way to do this or that, then go look that up, read that, and implement it. Then go on programming.\n\nReading advanced literature without programming yourself is useless.\n\n  \n\n\nI tried to follow this advice to just make projects even when I felt I was just incoherently babbling when searching for implementation approaches  and googling errors & bugs. I mainly just got yelled at on stack overflow for asking trite questions I could have googled and posting overly specific  project case scenarios,  but I lacked the vocabulary to dissect  and google my problems in a  better way.\n\n\n\nI might as well just try going through dozens of “master python books” because at least it’s something different, I am like a baby pointing at food it wants without any better way to communicate and getting yelled at for it.  sometimes I don’t even fully understand the ‘food’(implementation) I want because I cannot describe ‘tastes’ or ‘ingredients’(don’t understand how to design the pseudocode/blueprints properly or  account for every needed feature)\n\nI just know: “it needs to be sour” \n\n  \n  \n\n\nBut similarly to  a person learning a second language you must also commit the axioms to memory to then be able to question and deduce. \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\nIt is just hard memorizing so many things at once.  How do I allocate time between rereading over and over, trying to ask a question to actively engage then going on a wikipedia rabbit hole of concepts I don’t understand or questions I lack the field terminology to phrase coherently, \n\nand I ultimately feel it is ridiculous even though I try to remind myself it is necessary.\n\nrecall back to grammar classes. compared to learning vernacular which is just involuntary exposure to people speaking 24/7, grammar has to be established by rote practice- but also by reading books for exposure to information. \n\n\n\nI  just keep forgetting, especially in programming, but I don’t reread books, I usually rewatch intro to x programming language video and then start trying to google reference to implement a feature for a project.\n\n\n\nI don’t know how trying to design a project then awkwardly googling with no real certainty of what you are looking for is any different than tutorial hell. \n\n",

I want to use the next \\~2.5 years of the GI Bill to keep getting housing payments/benefits and keep growing my dev skills while I work from home. I will admit I really love programming.\n\nFor the sake of receiving a monthly payment and to continue learning which path would you take:\n\n1. Back to WGU for a BS + MS in Computer Science?\n2. WGU BS in Cloud & Network Engineering + a MS in CS? (I like networks so that would be fun but I want to add to my developer skills)\n3. I could get a local CS degree from Weber State University? But I may not be able to finish it with the remaining benefits that I have and I don’t want to pay out of pocket for some of the (second) degree.\n4. Go to SNHU or Full Sail University and get an education in Game Development solely for the self enrichment and fueling of a hobby? (This is what I want to do but I can easily continue to do this on my own and only see negative things about these programs.)\n5. Something else?\n\nI already hold Security+ and some minor certs. If I go the networking route I’d earn more certs through WGU. Looking for advice from people who’ve used GI Bill for second degrees, career pivots, or hobby degrees. I also don't want to uproot my family, we just settled in with a newborn after getting out of the military.\n\nWhat would you do if you essentially were paid to go back to school again?",

I applied, I thought I was good enough because I did good in classes with grades, and yet now I just CAN’T. The undergrad students in my courses are better than me at this! I’m not good enough to do programming interviews, not good enough to hack it at a Master’s, can’t even debug a goddamn C++ memory problem… I feel like I’ve wasted 5+ years of my life chasing a stupid whim I’m actually just total shit at. Maybe I should’ve stuck with optometry, even if I was shit at organic chem.\n\nI dunno if this is even the right place to post this, just need some place to vent before I plant my face into, through and right the fuck the other side of my window.

Is this language solely used for visual aspects of websites? I've been told HTML is used to display what the user sees and interacts with while other languages actually code the backend and actual function of the website.\n2. Is this language hard to learn? I know \"hard\" is subjective but would you suggest this language for beginners? It seems simpler than others but doesn't seem to have the same use as another broader language like python or C.\n3. Finally, how difficult is it front other conventional languages? Since it's basically just a visual language used for web development, if a beginner learns say, python first, how easy would it be to transition to HTML.\nHopefully these questions made sense.

I am currently studying cybersecurity, which will hopefully result in a bachelor degree after 4 years\n\nHowever, since I started coding, I’m experiencing some frustration and a lot of question marks when it comes to coding. I do have a background in python, I already know some basics and can code simple things, such as a calculator or a quiz. It’s just that at our university, coding is explained poorly and they basically expect you to figure things out yourself after demonstrating the current project that will last x weeks\n\nmy current strategy, when it comes to learning how to code, is YouTube tutorials and chat gpt, mostly chat gpt. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a copy and paster dude. I do use the code of chat gpt, I basically copy it by typing it myself and at the same time I’m asking chat gpt what certain things are. I than make notes and try explaining it in my own words. In this way, I learn new things about coding and how to apply it, especially with python(flask) and jinja \n\nI was wondering if some coders here with more experience, have any tips on how to actually learn how to code. Is my approach alright or am I just doing it completely wrong? ",

        "author": "cs-grad-person-man",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "(TL;DR at bottom of post)\n\nFirst let's get one thing out of the way: I'm not suggesting that you lie as well. That's an individual decision. I'm here just to tell you about my experiences as being part of the hiring process for a FAANG-adjacent company.\n\nSecondly, I just want to state right away that I believe this is an issue that stems from the hiring / recruiter side more than it does on the candidate side. We are the ones who have drilled into your heads that you MUST have metrics, impacts and keywords or else your resume is \"trash\". Candidates are simply doing what they need to do to survive in this crazy market.\n\nWith that out of the way.... let me tell you about my experiences.\n\nEvery job posting that our team puts up receives roughly 2000 - 3000 applicants within a day or two. Out of this 3000, maybe 300 make it past the initial automated resume screen and online assessment. Out of those 300, a recruiter might chat with 30-50. And from that pool, only about 20-30 candidates ever make it to the initial phone screen and subsequent onsites.\n\nNow here’s the part that really opened my eyes: once you’re sitting on the other side of the table long enough, you start to notice patterns, and one of the biggest is how much of what’s on those resumes is either overstated, strategically worded, or just not true.\n\nI’ve lost count of the number of times we’ve brought someone in who claimed to have “architected a high-scale distributed system” and it turned out they wrote a couple of endpoints under heavy supervision. Or people who listed “launched a revenue-generating product used by millions” when, digging deeper, they built an internal tool with a handful of users. I’ve seen candidates inflate internship projects into “production systems,” or even list companies that, when we checked, they’d never actually worked at in any real capacity.\n\nA big one that’s become increasingly common is people lying about the technology stacks they’ve used. You’d be shocked how many resumes list technologies like Kubernetes, Terraform, or Kafka as “production experience,” but when we ask follow-ups in the interview, it’s clear they’ve maybe followed a tutorial or briefly shadowed someone who worked with those tools.\n\nAnd here’s an important reality that most candidates (and even some hiring managers) don’t fully realize: background checks almost never verify WHAT you did. They usually just confirm your job title and employment dates. So if someone says they built a large-scale React application or ran infrastructure on AWS, there’s no background check that’s going to expose that as false. Unless an interviewer digs into the details, the exaggeration often goes completely unchallenged.\n\nAnd the thing is, many of these candidates still get interviews. Sometimes they even get offers. Not because they’re necessarily more skilled, but because their resumes are packed with the right keywords and “impact statements” that our systems and recruiters are trained to look for. Meanwhile, a candidate who honestly describes their experience with modest, accurate language often never even gets a shot.\n\nThis creates a really frustrating dynamic. The people who embellish tend to stand out in the resume pile, which pressures others to do the same just to keep up. And from where I’m sitting as a SWE involved in this process, that pressure is entirely on us, the hiring side, for building a system that rewards buzzwords and inflated claims over substance and honesty.\n\nSo if you’re sitting there wondering why you’re not getting callbacks despite real skills and solid experience, it might not be because you’re underqualified. It might just be that you’re competing with a lot of resumes that have been heavily optimized, or outright fabricated, for the hiring process. And unfortunately, those are the ones that often float to the top.\n\nOur team specifically now mostly just relies on references or \"people who know people\". We value that far more than trying to hire someone who noone on the team can speak about.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* People are inflating, exaggerating and lying on their resumes like you wouldn't believe.\n* The vast majority of honest candidates never even make it to the recruiter screening\n* I'm noticing it happen more and more (at least 70%+ of candidates who make it to onsite). Every resume has tons of impact, tons of metrics, tons of technologies. Yet the candidates can't speak about any of it in the interview.\n* I believe the blame is on the hiring side, not the candidates. It's been drilled into your heads to have metrics, impacts, and keywords to beat the ATS and impress recruiters\n* Our team is shifting to mostly just hiring people based on references instead. Far less risky.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I'm not sure what the solution is. Like I said, our team is now focused more on references than anything else but even that isn't a perfect system.",

While coaching them on 1:1, I notice they struggle to meet the basic SDE standards that are well within the scope of a new CS grad or at least something that is easy to find in internet.\n\nFor example - there's a dude that wasn't able to understand that a javascript function can return another function and not just a concrete value/object. He also asked me how a basic lodash function work - which is basically 1 google search away. Another dude was not able to explain his thought process on the code he wrote because I found that there is no relevance of the change he made for the feature development that was assigned. So, on a high level, I have observed that they cannot grasp the understanding of the system, have patience to read through documentations, question what it does and how to think of when writing code. \n\n  \nNow, there could be a couple of possibilities on this. First, maybe they are overwhelmed and feel like they need to push gold standard code from month 1, else they get fired. The brutal job market might be making them scared to lose the job and is presurring them to show up as an expert already. Second, maybe the ChatGPT really ruined their critical thinking ability and attention span for reading through documentations / articles. Third, could it be the toxic work culture at FAANG where there's a pressure of proving yourself to avoid layoffs? \n\nI am curious if the situation is same across all companies.",

I was laid off in June. Prepared hard, polished my resume with AI many times, applied to between 200-300 jobs in the span of 2 months. Got about 15 interviews, 4 offers. I think I could get more offers tbh but after I found the company I really liked I accepted an offer and stopped the interview process with the rest. I interviewed with Capital One, Visa, UKG, Amazon, Circle, Apollo, Citadel, FICO, GM and some no names or startups. That’s all to say that after reading reddit I was anxious to even apply but I think I got a decent amount of interviews and negotiated my offers to be either at the higher end of the salary range for the role or even above advertised. I do recognize it’s much harder for junior engineers these days but is there really a shortage for experienced engineers? I haven’t felt that. I’m not even a native English speaker although I do speak English fluently. I’m in the US. I also didnt lie on resume or cheated during coding rounds. Some of them I solved 100%, some not. For example for C1 I got 450/600 points on CodeSignal and still got a callback and an offer after clearing their power day. Ask me anything I guess. Happy to help someone if I can. No referrals though, sorry. I’ve just started a few weeks ago, too early to refer especially someone I don’t personally know. Here are a few things that I believe gave me an edge or worked in my favor:\n- referrals from my network\n- local jobs that required hybrid schedule\n- tailored resumes\n- soft skills\n- activity on LinkedIn (mostly commenting)\n\nI also tried to outsource the filling out job applications part so I can focus on preparing and interviewing but I didn’t have much success with freelancers from Fiverr. I was also approached by a “do it for you” company but they charge % of your first year salary + a fixed fee and I decided to just do it myself.",

What's worse is that you will ONLY apply to the jobs that everyone and their dog is applying to, which means your competition will be 10x higher.\n\nExample: I recently came across an NYC startup hiring multiple software engineers remotely in Canada that is paying $240-$300k base for people with 4-10 years of experience. They have [3 job openings](https://meterwork.com/employer/affiniti_YhHt2) but LinkedIn shows 0 jobs for [their company](https://www.linkedin.com/company/affiniti-finance/jobs/).\n\nI know the above is true because I spend hours a week finding jobs for my job board and regularly find companies with 0 jobs on LinkedIn but multiple jobs on their career pages. My point is, you need to start thinking outside of the box when job searching, especially in today's environment. You can't expect to do the same thing everyone else is doing and to see different results.\n\nAnd job boards are just one source of finding job openings, there are a few others that most people don't even consider. Ya I know it sucks that you have to go through all these hoops and tricks to find a job, but at the end of the day you just gotta play the game if you want to have a shot at winning.",

        "content": "Am I wrong to think that basically every company kind of sucks right now? I feel like since the start of this year especially every company is making their devs work 50+ hours while also doing mass layoffs.\n\nI've been interviewing with different companies and there have been multiple instances where they expect the candidate to work 50-60 hours a week, come into the office 5x a week, or work 6 days out of the week. This shit sucks.\n\nBig tech has gotten intense and stressful so its hard to chill there. Startups have insane competition and are tight on money so the expectations are you working super hard to make this thing survive.\n\nI understand this isn't true for 100% of companies but it feels like at least 70% of companies kind of suck to work at as a SWE. And by suck I mostly mean super stressful despite the pay and perks still being pretty good.\n\nIn conclusion, if every company kind of sucks I might as well take the highest paid role I can since they're all going to have intense expectations.\n\nTLDR; does every company kind of suck to work at so take the job with most money?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Maybe I was naive at the time, but early in my career (early 2010s), it seemed like companies knew what they were doing a lot more. At my first two or three companies, the CEOs all had the same story: they came from outside of tech and decided to make software to solve some problem that they were having. They could clearly explain what the problems they were trying to solve were, and how the solution did that\n\nThis seemed also true at bigger companies. Companies like google or netflix were at least *trying* to make products that appealed to consumers, even if it wasn't always a hit. Companies seemed to be run fairly well, or they were at least stable day to day. There was also lots of \"aspirational\" jobs, like places where if you got a job there, it felt like you hit the lottery\n\nNowadays things just... don't really seem like that. It seems like every single company has *terrible* leadership. AI integration into *everything* seems like a good example, I don't know a single person in my life who has ever wanted to use one of these things, most (like me) find them actively annoying. Some of their ideas just seem really out there. Like how Zuckerberg was talking about making a social network where you interact with AI companions. ... Why would I ever want that?\n\nThe companies just generally seem to be run more poorly. Vaguely communicated (if communicated at all) long term goals, seemingly no direction or conviction, no desire to compete and a seeming indifference to customer needs. Sometimes it even feels like they have an actively antagonistic view of their customers and people in general. Working at pretty much *any* company seems miserable",

The few places that do hire juniors get a large amount of applications and vast majority will be rejected. There is a very low amount of entry level jobs.\n\nBootcamps were a thing in my country by mid 2010s already (some of them already went bankrupt by now) and due to the \"learn to code\" movement a lot more people took CS and related majors at Universities than before. As a result, the job market became very oversaturated at junior / entry level.\n\nThere's also the AI hype which I think makes employers less likely to want entry lever developers.\n\nIn mid to late 2010s people were told that \"coding is cool\", \"coding is an easy path to success\", \"it's easy to get high paying job if you get a degree\" and that kind of stuff. I was naive and hopped on the bandwagon.\n\nBy the time I graduated in 2022, entry level developers were much less in demand than in mid / late 2010 because the market was oversaturated by then. I think the knowledge I had in 2022 would have been enough to land a job around 2015. I think the bar to enter IT is much higher than 10-15 years ago.\n\nI haven't worked in IT since 2022, moved on to other stuff. Why am I writing this? On one hand, to vent. On the other hand, to show the reality of this industry. (although this sub is already full of \"doom and gloom\" from what I've seen).\n\nThis is a very competitive field, you're competing against developers from all over the world, from countries where salaries are lower.

I used to think that these were stepping stones to a meaningful job, but... I don't know what that would be, at this point. Maybe I could go work in clean energy? Or on theoretical AI research that might eventually yield more useful advances? Or... something else? I don't know.\n\nI love working on software. And when I was younger I really believed that I could make good money doing this, **and** do something that mattered at the same time. Now... I feel like I won't be morally clean unless I give all my money to charity and go become a monk and wear a hair shirt. I know that's ridiculous, I know it's black-and-white thinking, but I haven't found a good framework for working out the moral calculus here.\n\nIt's even more exhausting because it seems like nobody in the industry of any note **cares** about any of this. It feels like I'm surrounded by people who believe that if we *just keep building,* something amazing will fall out -- as if these people didn't just live through the fucking crypto bubble and the rise of social media before that. The only high-profile people I hear talking about a moral hazard are the AI doomers, who are so infatuated with an imaginary apocalypse that they can't be bothered to think about the boring work of improving the real world. \n\nI know, this is a rant. To try to turn it into something more directed: have any of you felt this way and gotten back to a place where you felt good about what you do? If you did, did it involve changing jobs? What are you working on now?",

And it will make you feel that everything is hopeless.\n\nIt's important for your mental health that you moderate this. Yes, the job market is bad, but the posts in this subreddit make it seem far worse than it is.\n\nNow for a **real talk** about some people...\n\nI've been going around helping people with their resumes and portfolios to fix potential issues, and one thing I have noticed is that there is a decent amount of people (not all) who could do a lot more to boost their chances but feel demotivated from the job market and have just given up too early.\n\nI'm talking people who have applied for tons of software jobs but don't have a single original complete project on their github, or who have just got their degree and have nothing else to back it up.\n\nYes the job market is bad. Yes it is harder than it was a few years ago. No it is not impossible. While for a lot of people their resume and portfolio are strong, there is a decent amount who actually need some honesty and realize that part of the problem is them.\n\nThe most recent one I saw was a guy saying the job market was cooked, the comments offering a lot of sympathy. But the guy had a mess of projects on his github in obscure niche areas of programming with no comments or READMEs or anything to help organize it or explain what it was. And then had one of the least concise resumes I'd seen, I had to read over half of it just to try and even figure out what tech skills he had. Yet had been complaining he hadn't been able to get a tech job despite trying for over a year. I was honest but kind about it and gave advice and told him to ask for honest advice from people rather than just getting sympathy.\n\nBefore I get **downvoted into oblivion**, I am not saying this is true of everyone. It's just common enough from the posts I've seen in the last few weeks when I've looked at people's resumes and githubs/portfolios.\n\n* Have personal projects that are original. (Keep code copied from tutorials for learning, not for showing publicly)\n* Have tech skills that are relevant to jobs in your area.\n* Organize them neatly and with clear information for people to read.\n* Get your resume checked by different people. Do small projects with other people to show you can collaborate.\n* Help with open source projects to show you can meaningfully contribute to work that isn't yours.\n\nI am not denying at all that it's way harder than it use to be to land a tech job but it's not impossible either.",

        "author": "AuthenticWeeb",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "We all know the job market for entry to mid-level SWE roles is rough right now. The whole \"do an 8 week bootcamp and land a job with basic JS\" approach is long gone.\n\nThat said, I think it's unproductive to just say \"entry level SWE is dead.\"\n\nFor context: I don’t have a CS degree. I did an 18 month apprenticeship, a bootcamp before that, then stayed with the company I apprenticed at for 3.5 more years. So about 5 years total experience, now mid-level, but all at one place. I’ve been out of the market the whole time and things have changed a lot, now looking for new opportunities and trying to get my bearings.\n\nI wanted to start a discussion about what skills are actually needed today to get hired as an entry or mid-level engineer, both for the benefit of people trying to break into the field for the first time and for mid-levels who are looking for a new placement after 3–5 years of experience.\nFor entry I’d define it as something like:\n\n- Strong in at least one backend language\n\n- HTML, CSS, JS fundamentals\n\n- Understanding of version control and Git workflows\n\n- Testing basics (unit, integration, maybe e2e)\n\n- Databases (querying, relational vs non-relational)\n\n- Basic infra knowledge (what AWS is, main services and what they’re useful for)\n\n- Ability to debug code and solve basic errors\n\n- Basic understanding of work process and how to collaborate in a team\n\n5+ years ago this probably would have put you mid-level, so maybe I’m stretching it.\n\nOn mid-level, I honestly don’t know how to define it. I feel the line between senior and mid has blurred a lot. Most times I just do the same stuff as the seniors on my team, they're just able to get it done faster, have more stuff in-flight concurrently, and they communicate with the non-technical people more than me. Maybe mid-level just needs the same skills as I listed above, but with more independence, more depth in certain areas, and the ability to not shit your pants when things go wrong in production.\n\nCurious what others think. What skills are truly needed now?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the thoughtful answers. I’m mostly gonna stop engaging now since this thread turned into a circular degree vs no-degree debate. This sub isn’t a great fit for the kind of discussion I was hoping to have. If I see any genuine comments pop up I’ll read them though",

Been at Amazon for 1.5y as NG, looking at promo in the next 6-12mo (a few reorgs have slowed it down, politics...).\n\nLosing my new grad signing bonus when I hit 2y, so but I get a small stock grant, so overall salary is remaining stagnant ish until I get promoted. Google is L3, but the salary looks like it will be around £100k, and since at AMZN I am getting internally promoted up, my salary will probably be about £100k too, as an L5. (I'm not sure of the bands, I think its like £85k base and some stock).\n\nPerhaps moving to google, I can get promoted soon-ish too, since I am not a new grad and L4 google is L5 amazon, so theres a big salary bump incoming too?\n\nStaying at Amazon could be good as it is pretty chill and team is comfortable, and I'm learning as an engineer, and I can get those stock options I guess, but I don't think staying comfortable is great? Also interviewing with a startup that pays around £130k, might be good - I can move and challenge myself elsewhere, take a risk while I'm young, and make more money for it too?\n\nA lot of my friends are saying stay for SDEII promo, then move e.g to google or Meta as SDEII, instead of starting again as SDEI. I don't think it works like that though? Not sure as I haven't ever job hopped haha.\n\nWhat would you do?",

But how dire does it actually get in terms of people you personally know?\n\nFor me, despite being woefully unable to secure much progress through September as a senior set to graduate into an awful job market, even then it's not myself. There was some guy from my uni a few years older than me who did some drug dealing and ended up getting arrested. So while things do look economically bleak for me (and likely many others), at least I've got retained enough integrity not to end up turning to a life of crime and getting saddled on drugs (yet).\n\nIt's not like I personally know this person though. He just happened to attend my school. Absolute rock bottom might be Luigi from last winter (who has a MS CS), but I'm pretty confident most people don't personally know him.\n\nMost people I know are students lol, my age or younger. All my tech classmates who have graduated before me (2025 or earlier) are gainfully and relevantly employed to at least some extent right now.\n\nIn terms of people I actually know, mine would have to be one friend's sibling who majored in IT and hardly cared about anything, who right now just has a remote help desk job that pays less than McDonald's. At least it's not only paid but domain-relevant, and I'm sure many grads would be dying to be in a similar situation. My friend told me their sibling *could* upskill to IT Engineer if they just put in the effort but they just choose not to. Still, it's an IT help desk that pays peanuts, and wouldn't have even required a degree a few years ago.",

        "content": "I think I first start to get into programing was when I was 10? Using some Pascal IDE on my old Windows XP (I'm not that old at all, just grew up poor), that I hacked together from parts of all the other broken computers I had.\n\nI always loved to fix things, break things, then fix them again. Computers and programming is actually what got me into fixing other things. Electronics, then cars, then I even started building stuff (like carpentry). I guess it sort of inspired me to be a \"life long learner\".\n\nFor work as a teen, I went towards anything where you could fix stuff, or solve a problem people had. So I worked as a trades assistant in a variety of differrnt trades, and a machine operator until I had the money to go university to study CS, with the idea that this was going to be it for me as this as what I'd *always* done.\n\nWhat I noticed along the way with study is my urge to code in my own time wained as I studied. As well as this, I guess particularly in the last 10 years, I've developed a general disinterest in tech advancements and new software. To be honest, I resent a lot of it, because most of the stuff I inevitably have to use feels convoluted, old reddit > new reddit, type thing. \n\nNow that I do have some work experience I've realized one important thing I never considered:\n\n**Problem solving in the realm of software development is nothing like problem solving for yourself, or small clients** \n\nIf I fix a thing for a client (as a tradesman), it's immediately rewarding. You're helping someone with something they can't provide themselves, and it's usually something they need. It's immediately rewarding (for me).\n\nThe process of building software for a company, who's problem is they want/need more money, does not provide me with that same sense of reward and satisfaction.\n\nEven the whole idea of \"continuous improvement\" irritates me. Constantly changing stuff for the sake of... I'm not really sure? And often in the process, just making the product worse. \n\nI guess this is coming off as more a rant, but particularly I wanted to ask has anyone felt the same way, and what did you pivot to?",

        "content": "I'm entirely self taught, I picked up a project 8 years ago that ended up getting me a job offer related to the project after two years of working on it. I learned entirely on the go, picked everything up as I needed it for the work being done. But now the company I'm with is slowly dissolving and likely has only a few years left and I personally may have even less than that before they just decide to lay me off to help them delay the inevitable.\n\nThe thing is, right now I have extremely good savings and virtually zero debt. I own my home with no mortgage to pay, my utility bills are cheap, own my car, and have zero reason to move from where I am considering how good the cost of living is and how much of my family is around me. I don't like the idea of moving for work.\n\nSo my hope was to find literally any local-ish tech job or something fully remote (but lol, all remote jobs are inundated with applicants), there's a decent amount on offer because I'm only an hour out from a major city and right next to it is a sort of 'corporate hub' that has all of the state's big businesses. I didn't give a shit if I'm making half the pay of a cs newly grad, I applied for literally everything that I thought I could do. Ended up with around 80 applications sent, using a resume my buddy who's a team lead for a big tech company helped me build up with more than enough decent projects listed.\n\nIn the end I got three interviews, all of them were technical focused. None of them went well, they all seemed to immediately acknowledge that I don't have a degree and went really hard on testing the limits of my knowledge. Things that I've never had to learn, like databases or algorithms. I knew they were over the moment they started throwing vocabulary at me that I had never even dreamed of. I still did my best, hoping to God maybe they were just pushing my buttons to test me, but nope, didn't end up working.\n\nSo I go back to my buddy and his advice was basically to check out WGU, told me that I'd probably be able to finish a degree in a decent amount of time, especially if I optimize credits with Sophia and study (the website, not the act of studying). That I'd be able to rush through courses that cover topics I already know and fill in gaps of knowledge with courses I don't already know.\n\nI do think it's a decent idea, but my alternative is to just pick up more certs and start to learn topics outside of my knowledge zone, and that would probably end up taking less time, effort and money, but I have no idea if that's even going to make it any easier to continue my career.\n\n",

And I have also driven teams (as a lead, not a manger) to do the same.\n\nHowever… I started applying to other companies and I keep bombing live coding tests. System design? Not a problem. Behavioral interviews? Not a problem either. But ask me how to order a list by hand in python? I freeze and forget the millions of times I have done that in the last 15 years. You know what’s worse?

Thankfully I grew up with parents who have been fairly reasonable when it comes to my academics (though admittedly falling short in other sectors), and I'm well aware that letter grades mean jack shit when it comes to employability, but man, the sentiment does ring true when it comes to what you need to do to get interviews, ace interviews, and receive offers.\n\nYou have to outcompete everybody (technically, behaviorally, experientially) for a small number of roles (often just 1 or 2). Could range from 50 to 5000 applicants per role. But even if you do get selected you have to prove you're better than like 10 to 200 people. Referrals and nepo can help a slight bit, but they're no panacea (and I think part of the problem here is my family and I not knowing enough high-ranking people at smaller companies). Even the CS adjacent jobs like IT and data analysis or business analysis which might be more boring or compensate less face similar gauntlets as they seem to attract even more people from even more walks of life. It's like a shitty tournament or Squid Game.\n\nWhich means, if you're not the best of the best? You end up in the rejection pile. Big companies or small companies, 50k or 6 figs, government or industry, all seem crazy competitive, and oftentimes you end up rejected for no reason.\n\nI just wish I could've punched my past freshman self in the face and shake some sense into him. Whether that means taking CS, upskilling, interview prep, and LeetCode / systems design more seriously, or just choosing a different field altogether, it's hard to tell. But I feel like with so many applications per week and hardly a single callback, even with what I've been told is an impressive-seeming resume, it's getting hard to see anything but disaster down the line.\n\nI feel like I grew up hating competition, and was never really the type to win trophies in high school or anything. I remember sitting in my high school's auditorium listening to the vice principal name everyone who was in the top 10% GPA of the class, and I was sadly not one of them. I was hoping things could've changed for me in college, but sadly, the way things are right now for me, I'm woefully average. If you gave me an interview right now, there's a good chance I'd fall flat on my face. I've done some drilling and it's not like I'm anywhere near the stage where I can't even do twoSum, but many times it's still a toss-up. And I feel like no matter how well I do, there's always going to be some other applicant in the same loop with the same interviewers who will surpass me in skill, prowess, and ability to explain themselves, and who is thus going to be deemed better qualified for the role.",

I got a mostly positive response to that mostly pessimistic post. I updated based on recent data and expanded to cover industries that rely on Tech and Quant related skills. I’ll repost to finance careers as well this time.\n\nIn my original post, I shared that in my experience the job market largely reflects confidence that earnings growth will outpace inflation and bond markets. Here’s the S&P 500  [YOY RE growth](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-real-earnings-growth/table/by-quarter) over the last nine months:\n\n* Mar 31, 2025  10.58%\n* Dec 31, 2024  6.15%\n* Sep 30, 2024  6.11%\n* Jun 30, 2024  5.12%\n\n[Real M2 Money Supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2REAL) appears to have also reverted back to a normal rate of growth from before the pandemic. That, in addition to the earnings growth, should start a return to a “normal” job market. \n\nUnfortunately, back-to-normal is taking longer than anyone wants.\n\nI poked around a little more and noticed the following trend for S&P 500 [YOY Real Sales Per Share growth](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-real-sales-growth/table/by-quarter) over that same time period:\n\n* Mar 31, 2025  2.25%\n* Dec 31, 2024  2.24%\n* Sep 30, 2024  2.75%\n* Jun 30, 2024  1.95%\n\nThat suggests that companies realized earnings growth not through sales but instead through cost cutting by presumably reducing headcount. I posted a public [dashboard on FRED that shows headcount growth flatlining](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/dashboard/121649) (you can create your own economic dashboard on FRED).\n\nUnfortunately, I don’t think lower rates alone from the Fed will be enough. Also, unlike what I wrote in my original post, I don’t think there are any safe jobs or companies. Here are some other larger trends I’ve begun looking at - I am curious if others on Reddit agree or disagree:\n\n1. Between security concerns, software as a service, and low/no code customization, the number of products and versions have shrunk. Hence, companies have eliminated many jobs patching older versions of SW or journeyman jobs maintaining custom code.\n2. Overall, [the number of publicly traded companies has shrunk](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LDOM.NO?locations=US) since the 1990s. If it wasn’t for SPACs, the numbers would likely have gone even further lower. With fewer companies, M&A, auditing, compliance, and finance all rely on less and less headcount.\n3. The [increase in college educated professionals](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1MJlq) has diluted the unique value of any college degree. Even if you suspended H1B and OPT roles, it wouldn’t change the scale at which college educated professionals now participate in the job market relative to what they did 20 years ago.\n\nGrowth in public companies followed public market deregulation by Reagan in the 1980s and not regulating the internet starting with Clinton in the 1990s (Sec 230). I think we’re similarly at a point where we need to assess the structure/incentives of market regulation across the board. ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm looking for some advice on how to approach a conversation with my manager about my recent performance review and compensation as an engineer with only 1 YOE.\n\nI just received my first annual review yesterday and got a 5/5 overall with absolutely stellar written feedback (e.g., \"often finding innovative solutions superior to solutions that may have been proposed by senior engineers\", \"gone above and beyond in taking ownership and assuming the role of subject matter expert\").\n\nAt the end of our meeting, my manager only offered a 4% raise and told me that I wasn't put in for a promotion because \"it just doesn't happen after 1 year\". When asked, he mentioned that a promotion could be considered in my next annual review.\n\nI don't think this compensation reflects the value I've brought to the company or my team. This raise puts me at 78k while the position's listed salary band is 70-90k. I expected to be at the very least in the upper half of this salary band. I've also been praised for my work by many senior colleagues, even frequently mentioning that they think I deserve a promotion. All this makes me feel that I'm severely undercompensated.\n\nI'm not sure what my strategy should be when walking into his office on Monday. Should I push for a promotion to get a larger raise (I've heard stories of 7-10% at my company)? Should I just push for a larger raise without promotion? Should I negotiate other benefits like more PTO?\n\nI have been actively applying for about 4 months now, but haven't gotten any offers back yet, so I unfortunately don't have anything to leverage beyond my 1 YOE and many character references at this company. I really just don't want to waste another year in my HCOL area with poor compensation to get another disappointing raise.",

Outside of me, my boss, and our data scientist none of us are on the same page about anything. We all have a guy who is more or less “the project leader” and could be considered our superior. He’s been writing a program for about two years for one of our data tasks. It’s terrible. Like the dude is passing images into pandas dataframes and then iterating over the dataframe. To run the program once would take around 75 hours. I managed to cut it down to just under an hour. It’s not accurate either but that’s a story for another time.\n\nWell this superior says he wants to run his code. If we have any ideas for changes to the code we need to run it by him for him to change. Even regarding the massive runtime cut I had, he would prefer to make the changes himself. The issue is 1.) he’s not good at coding 2.) he’s extremely busy so a simple change might take an entire week. My boss told me to just change the code without letting him know. He and a few others have done this in the past before (this superior is typically weird like this about his code). I feel bad because I am pretty close with this superior on a personal/irl level and I’m also a bit fearful he’ll see the changes at some point and get mad. Not sure what to do about this.",

I’m considering options like WGU, or a Canadian university program that has a co-op component and try getting internships in big companies? Also with ageism and offshoring, I am becoming disillusioned with tech.

I did well enough in this degree that they hired me as a undergraduate TA to teach tutorials and grade exams for 3 out of the 5 years of my undergrad. I graduated right into the height of the pandemic so at the time, with the uncertainty of how the pandemic would shake everything  up, even though I was looking for a job in data science or related fields, I took the first thing I could get. The first job I got was related to front-end web development at a government agency and I stayed there for 5 years. I was a top performer for the last few years of my employment there (always got glowing reviews from my managers), but since front-end was something I kind of fell into, I decided to go back to school for CS and so started applying for schools again last September. Additionally, I have a younger sibling that was accepted to Google as a SWE this past year, so that gave me extra inspiration to work on myself.\n\nRight before I started school again this month, my team was made redundant and I was laid off. I was hoping to work there at least one more year while I took part time studies (I am part time for my first year as my math and stats degree requirements have all transferred and my gen-ed requirements waived), but fortunately I have enough savings to get me through my entire degree. My current school (York University) is probably a tier-2 equivalent school (if you would consider the University of Toronto a tier 1 school).   However, I want to do co-op which would extend my second degree to 4 years. Between co-op and EI (which I applied for as I am a part time student) I will have some financial buffer. But what I'm truly worried about is the CS market still being absolute shit by the time I graduate. I tell myself that this market downturn is only temporary as advancements in AI will most likely plateau, maybe the government down south stabilizes and the economy with it too, and like all market downturns there will be a time where it resurges but that's never a certainty.\n\nIf it were just me I think I would be able to manage. But my parents are getting up there in age and I'm afraid that if I can't get a job as soon as I graduate then I won't be able to support them when they retire. What is the best way for me, currently, to best maximize my employment chances as soon as I graduate (in terms of CS fields focus on) - given that I have a math and stats background I think either AI or Fintech would be my best options. I will network and do side projects. Ultimately the dream would be to join my younger sibling in working at a FAANG but for now I just need to maximize my chances at quick employment after graduation. I'm hoping my previous experience and math/stats background will set me apart from other fresh grads when the time comes.",

        "content": "I’ve always wondered this and wanted someone to explain their reasoning. For context I want to be a swe. I see people say “if I can’t get a job offer or internship I will just go to grad school”, as if this route is smarter financially. Grad school is incredibly expensive, federal aid is non existent for grad students, scholarships incredibly difficult to come by, and loans carry high interest rates. How in any way is this better than graduating, working a temporary job while continuing to code and build projects and apply to jobs?\n\nDuring school we must build side projects because the degree is in computer science not software engineering, the paper is not enough. If this is the case, why would post graduation be any different in that you would work a normal job and continue to grind. Are internships impossible to come by after graduation? If you graduate without internship experience you are somehow walled away because internships are a prerequisite to swe junior rolls? I would imagine you could find a gig even at a small company. Even if it took a while, your progress would still be faster because you’re not pushing the goalpost back two years. \n\nI’m just curious to hear from those with this opinion how continuing education is the safer route. If you’ve read this thank you and I look forward to your input. ",

I have a non-technical bachelors and have been slowly pivoting my career into a data-related role, recently deciding to go back to uni.\n\nThe CS masters is more general and has modules that are very ai focused, as well as an applied stats module and a machine learning module. The Stats and DS course is exactly what it says on the tin, and is more specialist. I am open to the idea of going for technical jobs like data scientist or more human facing roles like a data consultant. \n\nMy biggest concern is which would look better to an employer. I know that DS isn't as highly regarded as CS generally speaking, and that DS is very hard to break into with just a masters. So please let me know if DS would be worth my time? And if not, if I was to go down a more human facing route, which would be better? Thank you anyone for your time!\n\n",

This year, however –with the surge of AI–, I no longer have a stable job and find myself lost in such a competitive market.
