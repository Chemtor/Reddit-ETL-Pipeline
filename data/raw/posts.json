Bootcamps, online resources, and community content have opened doors for so many people. But at the same time, I can’t help but feel that the role is being diluted.\n\nWhat once required a solid foundation in Computer Science—data structures, algorithms, systems design, software engineering principles—has increasingly become something you can “learn” in a few weeks. The job often gets reduced to moving data from point A to point B, orchestrating some tools, and calling it a day. And that’s fine on the surface—until you realize that many of these pipelines lack test coverage, versioning discipline, clear modularity, or even basic error handling.\n\nMaybe I’m wrong. Maybe this is exactly what democratization looks like, and it’s a good thing. But I do wonder: are we trading depth for speed? And if so, what happens to the long-term quality of the systems we build?\n\nCurious to hear what others think—especially those with different backgrounds or who transitioned into DE through non-traditional paths.\n",

        "content": "Hi. I have a Databricks PySpark notebook that takes 20 minutes to run as opposed to one minute in on-prem Linux + Pandas. How can I speed it up?\n\nIt's not a volume issue. The input is around 30k rows. Output is the same because there's no filtering or aggregation; just creating new fields. No collect, count, or display statements (which would slow it down). \n\nThe main thing is a bunch of mappings I need to apply, but it depends on existing fields and there are various models I need to run. So the mappings are different depending on variable and model. That's where the for loops come in. \n\nNow I'm ***not*** iterating over the dataframe itself; just over 15 fields (different variables) and 4 different mappings. Then do that 10 times (once per model).\n\nThe worker is m5d 2x large and drivers are r4 2x large, min/max workers are 4/20. This should be fine. \n\nI attached a pic to illustrate the code flow. Does anything stand out that you think I could change or that you think Spark is slow at, such as json.load or create\\_map? ",

        "author": "StriderAR7",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone, I was doing a POC with Delta tables for a real-time data pipeline and started doubting if Delta even is a good fit for high-volume, real-time data ingestion. \n\nHere’s the scenario: \n- We're consuming data from multiple Kafka topics (about 5), each representing a different stage in an event lifecycle. \n\n- Data is ingested every 60 seconds with small micro-batches. (we cannot tweak the micro batch frequency much as near real-time data is a requirement)\n\n- We’re using Delta tables to store and upsert the data based on unique keys, and we’ve partitioned the table by date. \n\n\nWhile Delta provides great features like ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel, I’m running into issues with table bloat. Despite only having a few days’ worth of data, the table size is growing rapidly, and optimization commands aren’t having the expected effect. \n\nFrom what I’ve read, Delta can handle real-time data well, but there are some challenges that I'm facing in particular:\n- File fragmentation: Delta writes new files every time there’s a change, which is result in many  files and inefficient storage (around 100-110 files per partition - table partitioned by date). \n\n- Frequent Upserts: In this real-time system where data is constantly updated, Delta is ending up rewriting large portions of the table at high frequency, leading to excessive disk usage. \n\n- Performance: For very high-frequency writes, the merge process is becoming slow, and the table size is growing quickly without proper maintenance. \n\nTo give some facts on the POC: The realtime data ingestion to delta ran for 24 hours full, the physical accumulated was 390 GB, the count of rows was 110 million.\n\nThe main outcome of this POC for me was that there's a ton of storage overhead as the data size stacks up extremely fast!\n\nFor reference, the overall objective for this setup is to be able to perform near real time analytics on this data and use the data for ML.\n\nHas anyone here worked with Delta tables for high-volume, real-time data pipelines? Would love to hear your thoughts on whether they’re a good fit for such a scenario or not. ",

They do a great job tracking metadata, but stop short of doing what seems like the next obvious step, actually helping enforce data access policies.\n\nImagine a unified catalog that isn't just a metadata registry, but also the gatekeeper to data itself:\n\n- Roles defined at the catalog level map directly to roles and grants on underlying sources through credential-vending.\n\n- Every access, by a user or a pipeline, goes through the catalog first, creating a clean audit trail.\n\nIceberg’s REST catalog hints at this model: it stores table metadata and acts as a policy-enforcing access layer, managing credentials for the object storage underneath.\n\nWhy not generalize this idea to all structured and unstructured data? Instead of just listing a MySQL table or an S3 bucket of PDFs, the catalog would also vend credentials to access them. Instead of relying on external systems for access control, the catalog becomes the control plane.\n\nThis would massively improve governance, observability, and even simplify pipeline security models.\n\nIs there any OSS project trying to do this today?\n\nAre there reasons (technical or architectural) why projects like DataHub and OpenMetadata avoid owning the access control space?\n\nWould you find it valuable to have a catalog that actually controls access, not just documents it?\n",

Pretty simple right ?\n\nHere’s the kicker. The overpaid, under evolved nit wit who designed the databases didn’t add a single index on either of these tables. Both of which have upwards of 10M records. So, this simple query takes upwards of 90 mins to run and return a result set of 90K records. Unacceptable. \n\nSo, I set out to right this cosmic wrong. My genius idea was to simplify the query to only perform the join and select the required columns. Eliminate the dense rank calculation and filtering. I would then read the data into Polars and then perform the same operations.\n\nYes, seems weird but here’s the reasoning. I’m accessing the data from a Tibco Data Virtualization layer. And the TDV docs themselves admit that running analytical functions on TDV causes a major performance hit. So it kinda makes sense to eliminate the analytical function. \n\nAnd it worked. Kind of. The time to read in the data from the DB was around 50 minutes. And Polars ran the dense rank and filtering in a matter of seconds. So, the total run time dropped to around half, even though I’m transferring a lot more data. Decent trade off in my book. \n\nBut the problem is, I’m still not satisfied. I feel like there should be more I can do. I’d appreciate any suggestions and I’d be happy to provide any additional details. Thanks. ",

It's online and maybe easier to do, and could be useful if I'm always in meetings with architects who throw around terminology from ADM phases or talk about \"baseline architectures\" and \"transition states.\"\n\nBut basically, I get the high-level stuff, but I haven't had any formal training in EA frameworks.

        "content": "Hello\n\nI need a sanity check.\n\nI am educated and work in an unrelated field to DE. My IT experience comes from a pure layman interest in the subject where I have spent some time dabbing in python building scrapers, setting up RDBs, building scripts to connect everything and then building extraction scripts to do analysis. Ive done some scripting at work to automate annoying tasks. That said, I still consider myself a beginner.\n\nAt my workplace we are a bunch of consultants doing work mostly in excel, where we get lab data from external vendors. This lab data is then to be used in spatial analysis and comparison against regulatory limits. \n\nI have now identified 3-5 different ways this data is delivered to us, i.e. ways it could be ingested to a central DB. Its a combination of APIs, emails attachments, instrument readings, GPS outputs and more. Thus, Im going to try to get a very basic ETL pipeline going for at least one of these delivery points which is the easiest, an API.\n\nBecause of the way our company has chosen to operate, because we dont really have a fuckton of data and the data we have can be managed in separate folders based on project/work, we have servers on premise. We also have some beefy computers used for computations in a server room. So i could easily set up more computers to have scripts running. \n\nMy plan is to get a old computer up and running 24/7 in one of the racks. This computer will host docker+dagster connected to a postgres db. When this is set up il spend time building automated extraction scripts based on workplace needs. I chose dagster here because it seems to be free in our usecase, modular enought that i can work on one job at a time and its python friendly. Dagster also makes it possible for me to write loads to endpoint users who are not interested in writing sql against the db.  Another important thing with the db on premise is that its going to be connected to GIS software, and i dont want to build a bunch of scripts to extract from it.\n\nSome of the questions i have:\n\n* If i run docker and dagster (dagster web service?) setup locally, could that cause any security issues? Its my understanding that if these are run locally they are contained within the network\n* For a small ETL pipeline like this, is the setup worth it? \n* Am i missing anything?\n\n",

I took a month long online course leading up to my start date, and have done a ton of research and asked you guys a lot of questions (**thank you!!**). \n\nAll of this study/research has led me to two rough draft architectures to present to my company. I was hoping to get some constructive feedback on them, if you all would do me the honor. \n\nHere's some context for the images below:\n\n1. Scale of data is many terabytes to a few petabytes uncompressed. Largely sensor data. \n2. Data is initially generated and stored on an air-gapped network. \n3. Data will be moved into a lab by detaching hard-drives. There, we will need to retain some raw data for regulatory purposes, and we will also want to perform ETL into an analytical database/warehouse. \n\nI have a lot of time to refine these before implementation time, and specific technologies are flexible. but next week I wan to present a *reasonable* view of the types of solutions we might use.  What do you think of this as a first draft? Any obvious show stoppers or bad ideas here?\n\n[On Premise Rough Draft](https://preview.redd.it/9ktilxpp8uwe1.png?width=1413&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfe0ab54c719bc69a89480a42dad08e6b0f8c6a6)\n\n[Cloud Rough Draft. ](https://preview.redd.it/8y82yjrv8uwe1.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f2a64daad73fa82679d2e82c1b2383adae6910a)\n\n",

I graduated from my master’s program in 2021, and started my first job as a data engineer upon graduation. Even though my background was analytics based, I had a connection that worked within the company and trusted I could pick up more of the backend engineering easily. I worked for that company for almost 3 years and unfortunately, got close to no applicable experience. They had previously outsourced their data engineering so we faced constant roadblocks with security in trying to build out our pipelines and data stack. In short, most of our time was spent arguing with security for reasons we needed access to data/tools/etc to do our job. They laid our entire team off last year and the job search has been brutal since. I’ve only gotten 3 engineering interviews from hundreds of applications and I’ve made it to the final round during each, only to be rejected because of technical engineering questions/problems I didn’t know how to figure out. I am very discouraged and wondering if data engineering is the right field for me. The data sphere is ever evolving and daunting, I already feel too far behind from my unfortunate first job experience. Some backend engineering concepts are still difficult for me to wrap my head around and I know now I much prefer the analysis side of things. I’m really hoping for some encouragement and suggestions on other routes to take as a very early career data professional. I’m feeling very burnt out and hopeless in this already difficult job market",

I've observed a concerning trend: people working on managed services projects are often engaged throughout the entire day, handling both ETL support and ad-hoc tasks.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Data Engineering role, let me explain what ad-hoc and ETL support tasks typically involve.  \n**Ad-hoc tasks** refer to daily activities such as data validations, new development, modifying data sources, preparing data for frontend and ML teams, and more.  \n**ETL support**, on the other hand, is usually provided outside of standard working hours—often at night—and involves resolving issues and fixing bugs in data pipelines.\n\nThe main problem is that the same resource who works a full 9–5 shift is also expected to wake up at night for ETL support whenever it's needed. ETL errors typically occur 2–3 times a week, and these support tasks can take anywhere from 1 to 5 hours, depending on their complexity and urgency.\n\nMy concern is whether this practice is common across the industry? Wouldn't it be more effective to have separate resources for ETL support and ad-hoc tasks?\n\n**What are your thoughts?**",

This is especially problematic since some of our data (like blocks and transactions) needs to be available in real-time, with query latency under 100ms.\n\nTo manage this better, we’re considering separating our ingestion strategy: keeping batch ingestion into ClickHouse for historical and analytical needs, while finding a way to access fresh data in real-time when needed — particularly for the GraphQL layer.\n\nWould love to get thoughts on how we can approach this — especially around managing real-time queryability while keeping ingestion efficient and stable.",

I'm trying to understand the ins and outs of various solutions for the task of reading/writing diverse types of very large data.   \n  \nFrom a theoretical standpoint, I understand that Iceberg is a standard for organizing metadata about files. Metadata organized to the Iceberg standard allows for the creation of \"Iceberg tables\" that can be queried with a familiar SQL-like syntax.\n\nI'm trying to understand how this would fit into a real world scenario... For example, lets say I use object storage, and there are a bunch of pre-existing parquet files and maybe some images in there. Could be anything...\n\n**Question 1:**  \nHow is the metadata/tables initially generated for all this existing data? I know AWS has the Glue Crawler. Is something like that used? \n\nOr do you have to manually create the tables, and then somehow point the tables to the correct parquet files that contain the data associated with that table?\n\n**Question 2:**  \nOkay, now assume I have object storage and metadata/tables all generated for files in storage. Someone comes along and drops a new parquet file into some bucket. I'm assuming that I would need some orchestration utility that is monitoring my storage and kicking off some script to add the new data to the appropriate tables? Or is it done some other way?\n\n**Question 3:**   \nI assume that there are query engines out there that are implemented to the Iceberg standard for creating and reading Iceberg metadata/tables, and fetching data based on those tables. For example, I've read that SparkQL and Trino have Iceberg \"connectors\". So essentially the power of Iceberg can't be leveraged if your tech stack doesn't implement compliant readers/writers? How prolific are Iceberg compatible query engines?\n\n",

I feel like my company's practices are very sloppy and I am the only one that cares. We dont have good environment separation as many DE's do dev in a single snowflake account that is pointed at production AWS where there is PII and PHI. The level of access is concerning to me not only for leakage, but this goes against the best practices for development that I've always known. I've started an initiative to build separate dev,stage, prod accounts with masked data in the lower environments, but this always gets put on the back burner for urgent client asks. Looking for a sanity check as I wonder, at times, if I am overthinking it. I would love to know how others have dealt with access to production data. Do your DE's work in a separate cloud account or separate set of servers? Is PII/PHI allowed in the environments where dev work is being done?",

        "content": "Hello, a few months ago I graduated for a \"Data Science in Business\" MSc degree in France (Paris) and I started looking for a job as a Junior Data Scientist, I kept my options open by applying in different sectors, job types and regions in France, even in Europe in general as I am fluent in both French and English. Today, it's been almost 8 months since I started applying (even before I graduated), but without success. During my internship as a data scientist in the retail sector, I found myself doing some \"data engineering\" tasks like working a lot on the cloud (GCP) and doing a lot of SQL in Bigquery, I know it's not much compared to what a real data engineer does on his daily tasks, but it was a new thing for me and I enjoyed doing it. At the end of my internship, I learned that unlike internships in the US, where it's considered a trial period to get hired, here in France it's considered more like a way to get some work done for cheap... well, especially in big companies. I understand that it's not always like that, but that's what I've noticed from many students.\n\nAnyway, during those few months after the internship, I started learning tools like Spark, AWS, and some of Airflow. I'm thinking that maybe I have a better chance to get a job in data engineering, because a lot of people say that it's getting harder and harder to find a job as a data scientist, especially for juniors. So is this a good idea for me? Because it's been like 3-4 months applying for Data Engineering jobs, still nothing. If so, is there more I need to learn? Or should I stick to Data Science profil, and look in other places, like Germany for example?\n\nSorry for making this post long, but I wanted to give the big picture first.",

And if there are faulty records found, should we immediately alert the source or only if a certain percentage of records are faulty?\n\nAlso should we add another column in silver 'valid' which would signify if the record is meeting the table schema and constraints defined? So that would be the way to use this column and report on % of faulty records which could be a part of a DQ dashboard?\n\n",

        "author": "Kate-WeHaveToGoBack",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I have about 20 years worth of flat files stored in a folder on a network drive as a result of lackluster data practices. Essentially, three different flat files get printed to this folder on a nightly bases that represent three different types of data (think: person, sales, products). Essentially this data could exist as three separate long tables with date as key. \n\nI'd like to establish a proper data warehouse, but am unsure of how to best handle the process of warehousing these flats. I have been interfacing with the data through Python Pandas so far, but the company has a SQL server...It would probably be best to place the warehouse as a database on the server, then pull/manipulate the data from there? But what is tripping me up is the order of operations to perform in the warehousing procedure. I don't believe I would be able to dump into SQL server without profiling the data first as number of columns and the type of data stored in the flat files may have changed throughout the years.\n\n\n\nI am essentially struggling with how to sequence the process of : network drive flats > sql server db:\n\n  \nMy concerns are:\n\nBest method to profile the data?\n\nBest way to store the metadata?\n\nThrow flats into SQL server and then query them from there to perform data transformations/validations? \n\n  \\-- It seems without knowing the meta data, I should perform this step in Pandas first before loading into SQL server? What is the best practice for that? perform operations on each flat file separately or combine first (e.g., should I clean the data during the loop or after combining tables)?\n\n   \\-- Right now, I am creating a list of flat files, using that list to create a dictionary of dataframes, and then using that dictionary to create a dataframe of dataframes to group and concatenate into 3 long tables -- am I convoluting this process?\n\nHow to approach data cleaning/validation/and additional column calculations? e.g. -- Should I perform these procedures on each file separately before concatenating into a long table or perform these procedures after concatenation?-- Should I even concatenate into longs or keep them separate and define a relationship to their keys stored in a separate table?\n\nHow many databases for this process? One for raws? One for staging? A third as the datawarehouse to be queried?\n\nWhen to stage and how much of the process to perform in RAM/behind the scenes before printing to a new table?\n\nShould I consider compressing the data at any point in the process? (e.g. store as Parquet)\n\n\n\nThe data gets used for data analytics and to assemble reports/dashboards. Ideally, I would like to eliminate having to perform as many joins as possible during the querying for analysis process. I'd also like to orchestrate the warehouse so that adjustments only need to happen in a single place and propagate throughout the pipeline with a history of adjustments stored as record.",

There are some tasks that update Snowflake tables by running a SQL statement, and there are other tasks that updates those tasks whenever the SQL statement need to change. These changes are usually adding a new column/table and reading data in from a stream.\n\nAfter a few months of working with this and testing, it seems clunky to use tasks like this. More I read, tasks should be used for more static infrequent changes. The clunky part is having to suspend the root task, update the child task and make sure the updated version is used when it runs, otherwise it wouldn't insert the new schema changes, and so on etc.\n\nIs this the normal established pattern, or are there better ones?\n\nI thought about maybe, instead of using tasks for the SQL, use a Snowflake table to store the SQL string? That would reduce the number of tasks, and avoid having to suspend/restart.",

So for example, each day, we get a \"current month\" export for the data falling between the start of the month and the current day. We also get a \"prior month\" report each day of the data from the full prior month. Finally, we also may get a \"year to date\" file with all of the data from the start of the year to current date.\n\nNothing in the data export itself gives us an \"as of date\" for the record (the source system uses proprietary information to give us the data that \"falls\" within that range). All we have is the date range for the individual export to go off of.\n\nI'm struggling to figure out how to model this data. Do I simply use three different \"fact\" models? One each for \"daily\" (sourced from the current month file), \"monthly\" (sourced from the prior month file), and \"yearly\" (sourced from the year to date file)? If I do that, how do I handle the different grains for the SCD Type 2 DIM table of the data? What should the VALID\\_FROM/VALID\\_TO columns be sourced from in this case? The daily makes sense (I would source VALID\\_FROM/VALID\\_TO from the \"end\" date of the data extract that keeps bumping out each day), but I don't know how that fits into the monthly or yearly data.\n\n  \nAny insight or help on this would be really appreciated.\n\nThank you!!",

        "author": "loyoan",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey!\n\nI recently built a Python library called [reaktiv](https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv) that implements reactive computation graphs with automatic dependency tracking. I come from IoT and web dev (worked with Angular), so I'm definitely not an expert in data science workflows.\n\nThis is my first attempt at creating something that might be useful outside my specific domain, and I'm genuinely not sure if it solves real problems for folks in your field. I'd love some honest feedback - even if that's \"this doesn't solve any problem I actually have.\"\n\nThe library creates a computation graph that:\n\n* Only recalculates values when dependencies actually change\n* Automatically detects dependencies at runtime\n* Caches computed values until invalidated\n* Handles asynchronous operations (built for asyncio)\n\nWhile it seems useful to me, I might be missing the mark completely for actual data science work. If you have a moment, I'd appreciate your perspective.\n\nHere's a simple example with pandas and numpy that might resonate better with data science folks:\n\n    import pandas as pd\n    import numpy as np\n    from reaktiv import signal, computed, effect\n    \n    # Base data as signals\n    df = signal(pd.DataFrame({\n        'temp': [20.1, 21.3, 19.8, 22.5, 23.1],\n        'humidity': [45, 47, 44, 50, 52],\n        'pressure': [1012, 1010, 1013, 1015, 1014]\n    }))\n    features = signal(['temp', 'humidity'])  # which features to use\n    scaler_type = signal('standard')  # could be 'standard', 'minmax', etc.\n    \n    # Computed values automatically track dependencies\n    selected_features = computed(lambda: df()[features()])\n    \n    # Data preprocessing that updates when data OR preprocessing params change\n    def preprocess_data():\n        data = selected_features()\n        scaling = scaler_type()\n        \n        if scaling == 'standard':\n            # Using numpy for calculations\n            return (data - np.mean(data, axis=0)) / np.std(data, axis=0)\n        elif scaling == 'minmax':\n            return (data - np.min(data, axis=0)) / (np.max(data, axis=0) - np.min(data, axis=0))\n        else:\n            return data\n    \n    normalized_data = computed(preprocess_data)\n    \n    # Summary statistics recalculated only when data changes\n    stats = computed(lambda: {\n        'mean': pd.Series(np.mean(normalized_data(), axis=0), index=normalized_data().columns).to_dict(),\n        'median': pd.Series(np.median(normalized_data(), axis=0), index=normalized_data().columns).to_dict(),\n        'std': pd.Series(np.std(normalized_data(), axis=0), index=normalized_data().columns).to_dict(),\n        'shape': normalized_data().shape\n    })\n    \n    # Effect to update visualization or logging when data changes\n    def update_viz_or_log():\n        current_stats = stats()\n        print(f\"Data shape: {current_stats['shape']}\")\n        print(f\"Normalized using: {scaler_type()}\")\n        print(f\"Features: {features()}\")\n        print(f\"Mean values: {current_stats['mean']}\")\n    \n    viz_updater = effect(update_viz_or_log)  # Runs initially\n    \n    # When we add new data, only affected computations run\n    print(\"\\nAdding new data row:\")\n    df.update(lambda d: pd.concat([d, pd.DataFrame({\n        'temp': [24.5], \n        'humidity': [55], \n        'pressure': [1011]\n    })]))\n    # Stats and visualization automatically update\n    \n    # Change preprocessing method - again, only affected parts update\n    print(\"\\nChanging normalization method:\")\n    scaler_type.set('minmax')\n    # Only preprocessing and downstream operations run\n    \n    # Change which features we're interested in\n    print(\"\\nChanging selected features:\")\n    features.set(['temp', 'pressure'])\n    # Selected features, normalization, stats and viz all update\n\nI think this approach might be particularly valuable for data science workflows - especially for:\n\n* Building exploratory data pipelines that efficiently update on changes\n* Creating reactive dashboards or monitoring systems that respond to new data\n* Managing complex transformation chains with changing parameters\n* Feature selection and hyperparameter experimentation\n* Handling streaming data processing with automatic propagation\n\nAs data scientists, would this solve any pain points you experience? Do you see applications I'm missing? What features would make this more useful for your specific workflows?\n\nI'd really appreciate your thoughts on whether this approach fits data science needs and how I might better position this for data-oriented Python developers.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I can’t get up freely, I have to have someone replace me to use the bathroom, so a little over a month ago, I decided to teach myself how to code. \n\nThe first 3 weeks, I was zooming through languages, not studying and solidifying core concepts, I had an idea of how the components worked, and a general understanding, just wasn’t solidified.\n\nI’m also dipping in codewars, and leet code, doing challenges, and if I don’t know them, I’ll take time to study the solutions and in my own words explain syntax and break down how they work.\n\nI have 4 more months of this position I’m currently at, even though I hate it, it’s been a blessing that I get a space that forces me to study. \n\nSo far I covered HTML, loops, flexbox, grid, arrays and functions, objects and es6, semantic html and accessibility, synchrony and asynchronous in JS, classes in JavaScript. \n\nIs there any other languages you would recommend that I learn to become a value able software engineer in a couple of years? \n\nEdit: This post blew up more than I was expecting it to! I appreciate the advice everyone has given me. I’m going to not only prioritize on projects now, but enhance my math skills. ",

        "content": "Hello everyone. I thought I just wanted to share this experience with you. So I've been programming for the past 8-7 years now, I think? I'm 20 rn and I started at like 12 or something just dabbling around with Python + some html css (they're not programming languages but you know, intro stuff). I've always been kind of off with my math back then and was horrible at it. I've always just approached the problems in my code with just intuitive problem solving. You know, things that might just work.\n\nThese past months though, I've been getting really interested in math. So much so, that it has replaced my hobby of progamming (lol). What I noticed though was just how different I think about certain concepts. For example, functions. Back then, I kind of just thought of this as some wrapper of code that I can call whenever I wanted to. But getting to learn more about them in Calculus and how much I can manipulate them, it has also translated to my programming skills. Instead of just a wrapper for my code, I treat them now like actual items that take in parameters and spits out an output. Of course like, duh, but it really has changed my perspective and style on how I code now. Back then, it's more programming first then do the math to check. Now, it's math first, and let my code check if my math was correct. If it's correct, my code runs. If not, then math was wrong.\n\nI just wanted to share this insight with you guys who may be struggling to grasp some concepts in programming. Maybe, learning where these concepts came from might actually give you a deeper understanding of what they actually do.",

To me, these classes were very easy and I understood what was going on. I'd just need to take a few weeks to refresh my memory (which I plan to do through an Udemy course/reading textbooks).\n\nWhat I don't understand is... how the heck does programming even work? What the hell is happening?\n\nLike, how do people do things to somehow turn their code into a GUI on the screen? How does the text pop up? How can I manipulate the pixels on monitor to make my own GUI? I wasn't taught anything about this stuff and it feels like the programming I was being taught was extremely shallow. I can code a binary tree, I know about pointers and classes, but that's about it. I could make text based stuff, but how do I study the code on a deeper level? I know I could probably just import a GUI library and use it, but I don't want to just use a library, I want to understand how this technical stuff (that my school didn't teach) works.\n\nAre there any resources on how I can learn how computers work on a deeper level?\n\nSorry for the newbie rambling.

If you understand what you're doing, you can use an LLM properly, and become a fast producer of quality code.\n\nHere's the link, it's first-come, first-serve, and expires in 5 days: [https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-html-and-css/?couponCode=448BEC248CEC73F2AEA8](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-html-and-css/?couponCode=448BEC248CEC73F2AEA8)\n\nHappy HTML and CSS authoring,\n\nTony Alicea",

Don’t just write code for 5 hours and spend a whole hour testing it.\n\n\\- Printing the output makes it so you can identify whats going on in the program at that moment and can help identify where the problem lies.\n\n\\- Using a piece of paper to go through what should be happening, what is actually happening, and what my ideas are. For example if I have a function that’s supposed to take the factorial of a number, on paper I’ll write down how if there’s an input of 6, it should multiply 1 by 6 then go into a 2nd recursion layer to multiply 6 by 5, and so on. Then I’ll write down according to my code, what is actually happening.\n\nAny other tricks for debugging you know about?",

        "content": "I have things to get off my chest.\n\nToday marks the glorious 6 months of research for an internship abroad (I'm from France) required by my university to finally graduate with a master of Engineering in CS. I have literally sent hundreds of personalised applications (resume + cover letter) for most of them and got only like 8% of answers, most of them being automatic rejections. I initially applied for machine learning/computer vision (my major at school) openings, but since there is no way I ever get one of those, I've widely reduced the importance of what I'd like to do in order to send more applications.\n\nEven when I get to go to the technical tests, and perform (I have had platforms telling me things like you performed better than 95% of candidates), I still get rejected without getting to the interview phase, \"we've had a lot of competitive applicants bla bla bla\". The only interviews I got are from Belgian societies, refusing me even though they don't pay their interns. I mean, even for free (for them bc it would be a lot of money for me to get there), they wouldn't have me work for them ??? This is just crazy.\n\nI have already worked half-time for more than 4 years alongside my studies, meaning that I have at the very least 2 years of full-time professional software engineering and that seems to not count at all, I've even had interviewers telling it didn't count as experience and that I was a junior with less knowledge than a student who wouldn't have worked during his studies (I admit that I left the interview after hearing this bs)\n\nI tried many different things on my resume & letters to not get rejected by the automated TAS. Many people reviewed what I sent, so I don't think that the problem comes from there.\n\nI mean, how are we supposed to find internships in CS ? Is this really the result of those 5 years of studies ? Absolutely no consideration from companies that I'd love to work for ? I'm losing my mind over this..\n\nThat feeling of rejection/not being enough, even though I have proven multiple times that I can provide valuable workforce to campanies is just unbearable. Having people telling me that I should persist is now my new most listened song of 2025, but you guessed it : not my favorite.\n\nSometimes it makes me want to scream after thinking of all those efforts to apply that won't ever bring me anything but sadness and despair.\n\nFinally, I don't understand why I should intern to graduate. How in the world can I not already look for a fucking job and call it a day since I already validated all the exams ? This just feel like I have to be a poorly paid (or not paid at all) person to graduate, even though the reason for that is absolutely unclear.\n\nSorry if this is a little out of subject, I just wanted to share my experience of looking for internships after having decided, in 2019, that I wanted to learnprogramming. Thanks for reading.\n\n  \nEdit: Added that the internship must be abroad and that I'm from France",

That is simply how I understood it so I made a post in case there might be others.\n\n\n\nI often see comments on posts, asking how to learn programming, saying not to use AI.\n\nAlthough I am definitely no professional programmer myself, I have done quit a lot of learning (python, c#, and lately c++). I have always heeded this advice and have steered far away from using AI to learn how to code. Until the last couple of weeks.... and I have completely changed my mind about the subject.\n\nI still think it is a bad idea to have AI write up some copy-paste code as this definitely is not the best way to go about learning. Struggling a little and trying to get the code working yourself is what will cement the knowledge. But what I have been doing is submitting my code snippets to the AI after getting it to work and prompting it to analyze my code and suggest possible improvements. I then try implementing the suggestions and repeat the process.\n\nI feel this has vastly upgraded my programming skills, learning to implement fail safes, better error handling, better edge case handling, and being overall more robust. Still by no means am I any form of 'great' programmer yet but using Ai in this way has helped me progress a lot faster.\n\nSo, in my opinion there is no problem with using AI to help you learn, the problem is in how we decide to use it.

Pre-exams felt like climbing a mountain barefoot, and I honestly thought I wouldn’t make it through.\n\nI told myself that this would be the last semester I work on getting my degree - it was kind of a now-or-never moment. And today, I managed to reach a small milestone that once felt so distant: I passed. Not just barely - I actually did well. Despite all the confusion at the start, the stress, and the mental blocks, I pulled through and proved to myself that I can do this.\n\nI’m proud of myself - and honestly, I just wanted to hear it from someone else too. I usually keep things to myself and don’t socialize much. But if anyone else out there is in the middle of the struggle: please don’t give up.

But since I'm a total beginner when it comes to learning how to program, I'm not quite sure where or how to begin.\n\nI've checked out websites like CodeAcademy and FreeCodeCamp. They're great in terms of explaining concepts, almost like dictionaries, but I find it hard tot transition from theory to actually building and applying what I've learned. That's where I feel stuck. \n\nWhat I'm not saying is that CodeAcademy, FreeCodeCamp and such websites are bad. It's just that because of my lack of knowledge and experience that I don't know where to begin. It could even be that after all recommendations I would apply for CodeAcademy or FCC even, its just that I don't know yet.\n\nIdeally I'm looking for a learning platform that balances **teaching core concepts** (like how API's work, how to build them) **with hands-on projects** so I can apply what I'm learning as I go. I'm willing to pay- my budget is up to 40 dollars a month, but I also want to make sure that I'm choosing a platform that helps me build confidence and skills gradually, not just throw everything at me at once.\n\nLuckily my job gives me time during working hours to invest in this learning journey, so I'd love to make the most of it. Do you have any recommendations for platforms or paths to follow that could help me?\n\nThank you.",

        "author": "hello_aaron",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI hope you’re all doing well. I’m reaching out because I’m struggling with a severe lack of focus and productivity, and it’s been weighing on me for nearly a year. Let me share my story and explain where I’m at – I’d really appreciate any guidance or experiences you can share.\n\nBackground: In 2021, I got my first desktop from my brother, and I was instantly hooked on computers. I spent hours exploring, learning, and diving into coding. I started with C, moved to C++, and fell in love with programming. It was exciting, and I was learning something new every day. In 2022, I joined a Computer Science Engineering program as a direct second-year student. This was the peak of my productivity. I was coding 10+ hours a day, building web development projects with Python and JavaScript, and even mastering the MERN stack. I was so focused that I’d code through the night, feeling like coding was my entire world. My hard work paid off – I became one of the top coders in my college, and my peers recognized my skills. I built a strong portfolio and improved my resume, aiming for a developer job\n\nProblem: Things changed in my final year (2024). I started feeling depressed, demotivated, and lazy. I couldn’t focus on learning new skills or even maintaining my existing ones. While my peers were landing interviews and jobs, I struggled with aptitude tests (which I hadn’t prepared for, as I was so focused on coding). Sitting down to work on my laptop became a challenge – I just felt unmotivated. Despite this, I pushed through, and my past hard work paid off: I landed the highest-paying job at a major MNC in my college. I’m proud of this, but the problem persists. Now, with my degree wrapping up in the next 2-3 months, I want to use this time to improve myself, but I can’t focus on anything. I’ve lost the drive to learn new languages or build projects. Worse, I’m experiencing back pain from too much screen time, which makes me avoid my laptop altogether. I suspect I’m addicted to high-dopamine activities like gaming and YouTube Shorts, which make it impossible to start anything productive. My mind feels like it’s rejecting coding and my laptop for no clear reason.\n\nI’ve attempted every productivity strategy. I desperately want to be that person again who could code all day without distractions, but I feel stuck. This has been going on for almost a year, and I’m worried about starting my job in this unmotivated state. Has anyone else experienced this shift from being passionate and productive to feeling unmotivated and unable to focus? How did you overcome it?\n\nI’d love to hear your experiences, suggestions, or even just know I’m not alone in this. Thank you so much in advance for your help!",

That’s why I’m learning how to code(I’m actually interested in it but mainly, I’m a person who wants to try a lot of things). \nI had some ideas but I don’t even know if it’s beginner-friendly(of course I keep on learning) or Java-friendly. His birthday is in August btw. \nSo I need some advice from you. \n\nMy project ideas: \n•random recipe generator\n•random restaurant generator \n•Programm that gives him one reason a day why I love him(I want have 365 reasons)\n\nThank you and please be nice.

We don't even develop full class diagramas because in my experience it's impossible to know what atributes or methods a class will have before coding it.

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit, but I tried asking in r/computerscience, and they removed it, saying it was off-topic. I honestly don’t know how this doesn't qualify, since I’m trying to understand a conceptual difference.\n\nAnyway, here's my question.\n\nI got the structure of the `Memory` chip from GitHub. Everyone seems to be using the same implementation, and it works fine in simulation without any errors:\n\n    CHIP Memory {\n        IN in[16], load, address[15];\n        OUT out[16];\n    \n        PARTS:\n            DMux4Way(in=load, sel=address[13..14], a=loadram1, b=loadram2, c=loadscreen, d=loadkbd);\n            Or(a=loadram1, b=loadram2, out=loadram);\n            RAM16K(in=in, load=loadram, address=address[0..13], out=ramout);\n            Screen(in=in, load=loadscreen, address=address[0..12], out=scrout);\n            Keyboard(out=kbout);\n            Mux4Way16(a=ramout, b=ramout, c=scrout, d=kbout, sel=address[13..14], out=out);\n    }\n\nNow, based on this design, I expected the following code to read a value from the keyboard and store it into `RAM[1]`:\n\n    (loop)\n    @24577\n    D=M\n    @1\n    M=D\n    @loop\n    0;JMP\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* `@24577` sets the A register to 24577.\n* That value is passed to the Memory chip as the address.\n* The most significant bits (bits 13 and 14) are both 1, so according to the HDL, the `Keyboard` chip should be selected.\n* So `out` should reflect the keyboard's output.\n* Then `D=M` loads the keyboard value into the D register.\n* `@1` sets A to 1, and `M=D` writes the value to RAM\\[1\\].\n\nNow, here’s my confusion:  \nHow is this different from the following?\n\n    (loop)\n    @24576\n    D=M\n    @1\n    M=D\n    @loop\n    0;JMP\n\nBoth 24576 and 24577 have the same top two bits (13 and 14 = 11), so shouldn't they both route to the keyboard? Why would one work differently from the other if the given chip structure is true?\n\nedit: in the code section some parts were typed as “u/…” instead of “@…” . I fixed them. Sorry about that.",

        "content": "I've been working as a software engineer for several years, mostly focused on backend development. Besides interviewing myself once in a while for practice, I've also been involved in interviewing candidates at my company.\n\nAfter enough exposure on both sides of the table, something became pretty clear to me: Being able to solve problems isn’t what sets you apart. Explaining them is.\n\nSolving a question correctly is important, of course. But what really stands out is how clearly and naturally someone can walk others through their thought process. It’s not about over-narrating or reciting a rehearsed script. What makes a difference is:\n\nFraming your approach in simple, accessible terms  \n\nSurfacing trade-offs before you're even asked  \n\nStaying steady and unfazed when edge cases come up, as if you already thought about them  \n\nBecause of this, I gradually adjusted how I prepare for interviews, even casual ones. I still solve problems as usual, but now I also practice summarizing the solution in one or two clean sentences, basically a \"30-second version\", then being ready to dive deeper if needed.\n\nSometimes, I’ll use a tool that offers multiple solution paths and points out which parts are worth verbalizing, not just coding. It’s helped me avoid slipping into the \"just code it\" mindset.\n\nCurious if others have similar experiences. How do you practice improving the communication side of problem-solving, especially without sounding overly scripted?",

        "title": "Big O notation and general misunderstanding",
        "author": "divad1196",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Disclaimer: this post is also to vent.\n\nI got into a debate on something that I didn't think was so badly understood. The debate was with people claiming that \"big O notation is just counting the number of instructions\" and \"you must abstract away things like CPU\".\n\nThese claims are formally incorrect and only apply for specific contexts. The big O (and little o) notation is a mathematical concept to explain how something grow. It is never mentionned \"instruction\" as this isn't a mathematical concept. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)\n\nThe reason why we \"abstract\" the CPU, and other stuff, is because if 2 algorithms run on the same computer, we can expect them be impacted in the same way. \n\n\"All instruction take the same time\" (not all instruction take the same time, but the execution duration of an instruction is considered majored by a constant. A constant doesn't impact the growth, we can define this number to be `1`). In **simple** cases, the time is a function of the the number of instruction `n`, something like `duration(n) -> INSTRUCTION_DT * n` \n\nWhen you compare 2 univariate (\"mono-variadic\") algorithms in the same context, you get things like `dt * n_1 > dt * n_2`. For `dt > 0`, you can simplify the comparison with `n_1 > n_2`.\n\nSimilarly, when the number of instruction is fix on one side and vary on the other side, then it's easier to approximate a constant by `1`. The big O notation cares about the growth, there is none and that's all we care about, so replace a constant by 1 makes sense.\n\nBack to the initial point: we don't \"count the instruction\" or \"abstract\" something. We are trying to define how somethings grows.\n\nNow, the part where I vent.\nThe debate started because I agreed with someone's example on an algorithm with a time complexity of `O(1/n)`. The example of code was `n => sleep(5000/n)`.\n\nThe response I got was \"it's 1 instruction, so O(1)` and this is incorrect. `O(1)` in time complexity would mean: \"even if I change the value of N, the program will take the same time to finish\" whereas it is clear here that the bigger N is, the faster the program finishes.\n\nIf I take the opposite example: `n => sleep(3600 * n)` and something like `Array(n).keys().reduce((a, x) => a + x))`\nBased on their response, the first one has a time complexity of `O(1)` and the second one `O(n)`. Based on that, the first one should be faster, which is never the case.\n\nSame thing with space complexity: does `malloc(sizeof(int) * 10)` has the same space complexity has `malloc(sizeof(int) * n)` ? No. The first one is `O(1)` because it doesn't grow, while the second one is `O(n)`\n\nThe reason for misunderstanding the big O notation is IMO:\n- school simplify the context (which is okay)\n- people using it never got the context.\n\n\nOf course, that's quite a niche scenario to demonstrate the big O misconception. But it exposes an issue that I often see in IT: people often have a narrow/contextual understanding  on things. This causes, for example, security issues. Yet, most people will prefer to stick to their believes than learning.\n\n\nAdditional links (still wikipedia, but good enough)\n- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory (see \"Important Complexity Classes\")\n- DTIME complexity: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTIME\n",

I barely am able to code and when I code, I need to check countless times on how to write specific commands or even very general basic ones. I feel how the pressure and difficulty is getting into my head when I need to program for a project and I cannot deal with it very well. I try to visualize my code in my head but I cant. I lose focus where what is suppose to happen or I cannot even built a code in my head that solves the most simple problem. I have a lot of self-doubt and I just cant deal with it anymore. I used to be the smart kid in school and a smart adult nowadays but when I compare myself to the other students in my course, I feel trashy and I feel like theres a big wall of missing understanding that keeps me away from reaching the potential and skills they did. I try many times to just pick everything up and learn it but every time I just fall to my knees, feeling simply overwhelmed.\n\nI dont want to use AI to write my programs, doing that led me to not practise enough honestly. I should also mention that I have Azbergers, so tho I think very logical, I am basically screaming internally everytime I see code because I cannot for the love of god visualize code in my head for some reason.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "TL;DR:\nAfter years of chasing a tech career that never paid or stabilized, I am leaving for a career that can support a family and offer real security. I still love tech, but I had to move on to survive.\n\n\nI thought tech would be the future I built my life on. It didn’t work out.\n\nI chased a tech career for years, but it never came together. Ironically, I made the equivalent of around $80k a year in the military before I even had a degree, and some years a bit more. After graduating, despite years of effort, I never made over $80k again. After unstable contracts, low pay, no benefits, and rising living costs, I found a different career starting around $140k total comp and quickly climbs toward $200k and beyond, offering real retirement options and meaning that tech never did for me.\n\nI started coding for fun at 16, back in 2006. It was not rare, but it was far less common than it is today. When college came, I should have taken on debt and jumped into tech earlier. But I saw loans like credit card debt, and my family did too. We did not understand grants or aid. I was the first in my family to pursue a degree. Instead, I joined the military to pay for college.\n\nWhile serving, I started taking tech seriously. I built projects, took classes early, and did well both academically and physically. I am a combat veteran. After leaving, I moved to a major west coast city, earned a degree from a respected state university, and started trying to build a tech career.\n\nI completed two internships at large tech companies, but after graduating around the time layoffs began sweeping the industry, I could not find work for about a year. When I finally broke in, I spent the next few years grinding through mostly contract roles, including development, support, and program management, at two FAANG companies. Most paid well under $80k, with no benefits. Even working over 40 hours a week, I was barely surviving. And it left me drained trying to find new work throughout those three years while I worked over 40 hours. I had eventually applied to thousands of jobs even though many were targeted applications. It was consuming my life with no benefit.\n\nOver the last few years, I interviewed for about 20 roles, but nothing stuck. Pay stagnated, inflation rose, contracts ended, interviews were canceled mid-process because of layoffs and outsourcing. I did not want to leave tech. But eventually, the cost of living made it impossible to stay. I am starting a family and I want to buy a home, and the path I was on in tech could not support either.\n\nI needed something meaningful I could rely on for career growth and stability. That is when I turned to law enforcement. It shares some overlap with the military in structure, though it is not the same. For me the constant deployments were the only thing I didn't enjoy, and this is the closest I could find that felt similar without needing to travel overseas constantly. It felt like a better fit for the life I needed to build.\n\nNow, I am starting my new career. In many major west coast cities, law enforcement compensation surprisingly matches or beats the tech roles I once chased. Retirement comes in your early 50s if you want it, without penalty. I plan to use my GI Bill for a master's degree and eventually specialize in areas like police forensics. It is already improving my quality of life.\n\nI am mourning the career and identity I once imagined. But I am hopeful about what lies ahead. This path will eventually give me the freedom, disposable income, and stability to return to tech on my own terms, whether that means building my own product, starting a company, or, if nothing else, creating open-source tools that still have real impact. It may not look like the dream I once had, but it might be a better one.\n\nFor now, it is another opportunity for someone else who loves this field the way it demands. I am finally choosing a path that fits me, and I do not regret it.",

Last year, the manager ended up writing code, something he hadn’t done in 10 years, because the team that would normally do it wasn’t available.",

        "content": "I just want to put a disclaimer: I am not saying FAANG or Big Tech sucks. It has its pros, but it also has its cons. Same with non-tech companies. But looking back on my years in the industry.. I just want to reflect on my experience and post about it.\n\nWhen I was just starting out, I thought I had it all figured out. Like so many others in this sub, I had one goal drilled into my brain: FAANG or bust. I thought if I was not at a top tech company or at least something adjacent, I was failing. That prestige, that resume clout, that salary, it was all that mattered.\n\nFast forward to today. I am at a FAANG-adjacent company, something people would brag about on LinkedIn, and honestly I am exhausted. I am not even talking about having a busy week tired. I am talking about chronic, soul-sucking, life-flattening exhaustion. Every day feels like running a marathon at a sprinter's pace. There is an endless barrage of Slack messages, Jira tickets, unexpected urgent meetings, and late-night pings that just need a quick review. Every quarter feels like another round of brutal performance reviews where you are judged against metrics that seem to move the second you get close to hitting them.\n\nEven my friends who made it into the actual FAANG companies are not living the dream. They are constantly worried about the next round of layoffs. They are stuck in environments where one minor mistake can tank their rating and put their career at risk. Some are taking anxiety medication now. Some do not even enjoy coding anymore, something that used to be their passion. It has been hard to watch.\n\nAnd then there are my other friends.\n\nThe ones I used to quietly judge. The ones who went into banking tech, insurance companies, healthcare systems, government contractors. The so-called safe non-tech companies.\n\nWhen we catch up, the contrast is hard to ignore. They work 20 to 30 hours a week. They log off by 4 PM, laptops closed until the next morning. No emergency production issues in the middle of the night. No hyper-aggressive performance reviews. No constant fear about the next reorg or layoff. Their companies are profitable and stable and not reacting to every market fluctuation with mass job cuts.\n\nThey are happy. Genuinely happy.\n\nThey have hobbies. They go hiking. They build side projects for fun. They go to the gym without feeling guilty. They spend time with family, with friends, with themselves. They are not worried about falling behind because their companies are not built on a culture of constant comparison.\n\nWhen I look at them now, I see peace. A peace I forgot was even possible in this industry.\n\nI was so obsessed with winning early on that I did not realize how much I was sacrificing along the way. My health. My happiness. My actual life outside of work. I thought prestige would make it all worth it, but you cannot deposit mental stability into a bank account. You cannot get back the years of stress you burned through trying to chase a logo on a resume.\n\nI am proud of what I have achieved. But if I could go back and tell my younger self one thing, it would be this: ***Prestige is not everything. Stability and happiness matter more than any brand name ever will.***\n\nTo anyone out there grinding away and feeling miserable but telling themselves it will all be worth it once they get to the next step. Please remember that you are allowed to choose a different path. You are allowed to choose yourself over the brand. It is not giving up. It is winning in a different way.",

I'd rather not take a pay cut, but boy it looks like I would have to -- even after allowing for benefits etc in the calculation. \n\nSo what's going on here? Are we just still kind of reshuffling from shift to remote work? Is the lack of easy money from investors hampering hiring?",

In that case, trying to make an argument that you aren’t responsible for something is more likely to make you seem like you can’t take accountability.\n\nOr, in a feedback session, you get negative reviews from them on your performance for what seems like arbitrary reasons and you want to give an explanation/justification. In this case, there’s no explaining away what they’ve decided. You’re more likely to come off as insecure and argumentative for talking back.\n\n\nI’m not going to give a speech about how maybe you need to do self-reflection and practice humility; sometimes you’ll be in the right and you know you’re in the right. But career-wise, being right < manager being pleased.\n\n90% of the time, your manager has already made up his mind on how he feels about a situation.\n\nPart of your manager’s role is assessing your performance and giving feedback. So when you push back, not only are you expressing that you disagree with their opinion, you’re also coming across that you think you are better at their job than them (maybe you are?).\n\nI write this because I’m usually a self-advocate outside of work, but I’ve gotten to a point where I have to tell myself “it’s not worth it” quite a bit because of how important it is to not be a problem employee in this economy. \n\nThe best recoveries I’ve had when I’m given feedback or told negative things (that I personally feel like are not my fault) is to not disagree or try to explain, it’s just thank them for the feedback and keep working.",

A lot of them were advertising and boasting that their (bootcamp grads) were becoming productive in a few weeks, while it took university grads 1 year to become productive (based on market research). Does it actually take that long?\n\nI've also heard stories that a surprisingly large number of fresh grads can't even solve fizzbuzz.\n\nI find all of this stuff so puzzling. Say that you graduated with a degree in CS. Maybe you have one fullstack CRUD app to your name as a personal project, and maybe you did a team project in school where you used git and worked with a team of people where you made a  technical toy project that required some problem solving, no fancy UI or anything like that.\n\nWhat is realistically that difference between this person and someone who has 2-3 years work experience as a developer that also have to learn a new tech stack? \n\nI can't really see why the new grad would necessarily be worse, or not given a chance. To me it mostly comes down to IQ, personal ability, personality, communication skills etc.  \n\nSure, in an application process its hard to give the \"new grad\" a chance. But if you give them an interview at least they can show their personality/how they think about things. \n\nI've also heard that everyone is saying that there's 1000 applicants for every job, that's why people with 0 experience get 0 interviews. But how is that even possible, and wouldn't it eventually even out? If there's 20k available jobs, and 20k available candidates, some jobs aren't being filled. I guess new grads are just so incredibly bad that the loss of hiring them is way bigger than not having a filled position?\n\nAlso how does AI play into this? Is juniors just so bad that any senior just automatically does the job now with AI 10x as fast? So there's no need for juniors?",

I’ll have a year of professional experience in July\n\nI’ve been going through horrible mental health, my plan was to double down and apply to jobs in Q2.

The first two were with the agency, the last was with the company I’ll be working with (which was also live coding). I did a take home assignment, needed to add fizzbuzz logic onto a premade app\n\nIn the first tech interview I had to set the starting/default amount (of the input) to 10. In the live coding one, they wanted me to refactor the fizzbuzz function. But it was also mainly communicating what stuff does! Which is really cool cause I had to do that a lot in my previous roles, doing tech demos every once in a while \n\nI was told by friends that they wanted to do this to see if I could actually program and didn’t rely off of AI.  And also to see how I think\n\nI did the interview Tuesday and PASSED!!! Im really excited, these guys seemed incredibly nice. The past two years have been incredibly stressful, being really unstable and not earning enough money to pay the bills— I’ve been living off of my savings and doing gig work since the jobs I got didn’t pay enough. I just really really love software development so I stuck through and I finally got something I’m so excited!!!! I’ll also finally be able to save!!",

And with how fast AI and automation are evolving, it feels like the future is more fragile than most people admit.\n\nBecause of that, I’ve been thinking about how to start building real independence early:\n\n1.Side skills that could turn into freelance work.\n\n2. Small projects that could eventually generate income streams outside of employment.\n\n3. Financial strategies to lower dependence on a paycheck.\n\nI’m not planning to quit my job or anything crazy. Just want to start laying bricks while the sun is shining, instead of waiting for a storm.\n\nCurious:\n\n1. Has anyone here started building their \"Plan B\" while still working full-time?\n\n2. What skills or projects would you prioritize if the goal was optionality and resilience, not just climbing the career ladder?\n\nWould love to hear from others thinking about this, feels like something more of us should be working on but it rarely gets talked about.",

I didn’t get to make any mistakes in this short tenure yet, but I imagine if I did, then he would come up with a speech about how breaking things is the way of innovation or some other nonsence. \n\nThis manager was recently promoted into his role after being an individual contributor for a long time at this company, so I imagine it’s not out of the ordinary that he still doesn’t have a hang of things.

        "author": "Pyciko_",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello. I'm a programmer in a tech startup that develops IoT devices for on-water activities as well as a companion app for them. Due to the nature of our usage case, we sometimes have to operate in bad network conditions: the internet bandwidth may be small, the link between smart trackers and user's phones may be unstable.. etc.. A binary protocol is such a good fit for this situation: saves the bandwidth, allows to have a unification between TCP and Bluetooth comms, works great on low-ram IoT devices. My first look went into Protobuf of course, as it slowly shapes like a new \"JSON of binary world\". But when I started digging deeper, I discovered that it has multiple big downsides and I can easily fix them if I make my own proto (spoiler: I made it).\n\n1. The generated code is HUGE (especially in Dart which is used for frontend).\n2. It doesn't support classes inheritance. Inheritance can be bad in some cases, but if inheriting a class with some common fields halves the codebase size, I do want to have that option.\n3. Some features like Enums are replaced by strange stuff like int consts (again, Dart code looks even worse)\n4. That whole stuff with optionals and fallback defaults isn't reliable: if it's a backwards compatible protocol, the fields have to be explicitly nullable without any fallback values.\n5. You can just make a bitfield for null values at the start of the message, and by doing so, you can get rid of the field headers (id + type) entirely: the id doesn't exist because fields are sequential, the type is known in schema. If receiver schema is old and transmitter has sent some unknown fields, these fields are always at the end of the message, so you can just skip these bytes.\n\nAnd so what I did is I actually wrote a protocol myself, and tested it for a while. Now, even though I still love it, my mind keeps thinking about the following problem: if and when the time comes to hire more people, how do I explain this tech stack to them? Protobuf is a well-known thing, we can just put it as a requirement and be okay. But what about in-house solution? Also, if we need to add another programming language the our system, the protocol has to be implemented by someone.\n\nNow I'm doubting if I should continue working with our in-house protocol, or switch to Protobuf.  \nMy questions are:\n\n1. Is an average developer ready to learn custom binary protocols?\n2. In other companies using binary protocols, how popular is it to write a custom one and how do employees feel about using it?\n3. Am I the only one to be unhappy with Protobuf and do I get something wrong about it?",

        "author": "thefox13guy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've been a programmer professionally since the late 00s. I'm in Portland, which is just a mid-sized market, but still has plenty of tech jobs. I've worked at small startups as the first or second full time dev, some mid-sized companies, and FANG. I've been through a few acquisitions and survived many layoffs.\n\nWell, I was recently laid off for the first time from a mid-sized, B-tier tech company that I was having a great time at, so I am out there applying again. It was due to the typical offshoring trend and I was grateful to have survived a few rounds of layoffs and wasn't too worried. I've never had a hard time getting responses from local companies, and probably most of the time I would get interviews, and most interviews I would get an offer. But this time is different.\n\nI've applied for about two dozen companies (hybrid or onsite, haven't expanded to remote yet) and gotten almost no response. I think I am more than qualified for them and am perfectly fine with the compensation and all of that (ie, I wasn't just randomly blasting applications out there, I was picking things I genuinely wanted to do). 2-3 companies sent me a rejection based on my application, I've talked to 2-3 recruiters, and had one \"onsite\" interview. So let's just say I've gotten any response at all from about 25-30% of the companies I sent applications to. This is much lower than I'm used to.\n\nHere is the thing: I'm starting to wonder if having been at FANG and Big Tech (even though it was B-tier) most recently has hurt my chances. Just a few years ago I would've thought that having FANG would be a huge benefit for job hunting. And the 2-3 recruiters I've talked to seemed to like it, like it would make me a more marketable candidate.\n\nBut after the one onsite interview, I started to question that for the first time. I was prepared for a technical interview with maybe some behavioral, but the interviewer asked me quite a bit about FANG. I was surprised and got the feeling they thought negatively of it, like asking me about certain projects and responding with, \"So, you're saying you just wrote some Java?\" with a tone that they were downplaying what I did there.\n\nDon't get me wrong. Everything at FANG wasn't very impressive. The whole thing is mostly a joke (esp. the LeetCode interviews and corporate Kool Aid) and FANG tends to be a grindhouse for new grads who otherwise have no other experience, not a bunch of math geniuses writing crazy algorithms. But prior to that interview I didn't stop to think if I should mention it in my work history; it seemed obvious that I should. Now I'm starting to wonder all sorts of things like maybe companies are gonna think I'll ask for hundreds of thousands, that I only know how to do \"Big Tech non-sense\", or that I'll be a hard to work with.\n\nDo any hiring managers or ex-FANG have any thoughts on this? Seeing as how I am just looking for a local tech job where I can get work done and enjoy my time with the team, maybe I should just remove it from my work history?",

        "content": "Hi guys!\n\nBased on what I've seen on Reddit and other social media (LinkedIn, IG), today’s job market seems to favor specialists over generalists, and job hoppers are looked down upon.  \n  \nWith the job market being this rough, many people end up taking jobs they aren't necessarily passionate about (stepping stones) but they can't just immediately leave to not be flagged as a job hopper. *BTW, I'm thankful for having a job. I know it's tough out there.*  \n  \nHow can they make the most of these opportunities?\n\nFor example, what if the job uses a completely different tech stack than what you've worked with throughout your career, or even worse, historically the market don't want this tech stack, or if the role is different (i.e. transitioning from backend to frontend heavy fullstack), or you're not interested in the domain (i.e. insurance)?  \n  \nIf you plan to stay in this job for at least 3 years while waiting for the job market to improve (if it ever does), how can you make the most of the situation?\n\nIn my experience, becoming a domain expert and the goto person in a part of the system it's what makes you grow within an organization. However, becoming an expert requires time and effort, and both of these have an opportunity cost.\n\nSo knowing that time is finite and I can just study so much while keeping all my other adult responsibilities, should I focus on becoming an expert in this new tech stack and domain to take ownership and grow, in detriment of my original stack, knowing that my original stack is still evolving and requires ongoing study, and that I might never use this new stack again?",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a 31M with about four years of software engineering experience. I spent my first year working as a consultant and have since been working as a fullstack engineer, with a heavy focus on backend engineering.\n\nCurrently, I'm at a large tech company — maybe a step or two below FAANG — but it's a name most people would recognize. Lately, though, I've been feeling stagnant. I'm still classified as an entry-level engineer in terms of pay and title, even though I'm consistently performing at a level or two above that. (That's not just my opinion — both my manager and two technical mentors have told me this.)\n\nFor example, as a Level 1 engineer, I'm technically supposed to be mostly taking tickets, relying on senior engineers for clarification, and developing technical depth in one main language. In reality, my day-to-day work involves starting and completing projects independently, defining requirements while working with outside stakeholders, implementing new technologies into our tools, and even managing a contractor. There’s a big gap between my responsibilities and my official title.\n\nSome extra context: since joining my current role, my company has gone through two rounds of layoffs, and my team has been moved under two different organizations (so I've had two different skip-level managers). Although no one has explicitly said it, I suspect that promotions are being slowed or avoided to cut costs, especially since the current job market makes it less likely that people will leave. Promotions *have* happened elsewhere in the company, but not on my team.\n\nThat said, if I didn't enjoy my job, I would just risk it and leave. But the truth is, I actually like it. My boss is supportive, my work-life balance is solid, and the benefits are good. The only real issue is that my career growth — specifically my title and pay — feels stuck. Technically, I'm still learning and working on interesting problems, so in that sense I’m not stagnant.\n\nI'm looking for advice on what to do next. Stay patient and hope things change? Look for a new opportunity elsewhere?  Thanks!",

Grateful to have something stable in this economy. But the compensation doesn’t increase much in the long run in my company compared to big tech and its always been my dream to work at a big tech like google.\n\nA few questions:\n1. ML work here in my company is mostly calling LLM APIs which I find boring. One of the main reasons why I switched to MLOps. If you are an MLE at a big tech how does your work look like?

I currently work at a local Fortune 500 company's office making ~$85k/year, and have been here for almost a year. I've accepted an offer as an SDE-1 from one of the major tech giants for approximately double my current salary. The new offer is in the same city, so thankfully I don't have to handle moving logistics along with everything else here.\n\nI have received e-contracts that I've clicked \"sign\" on (not sure how binding these are?), and their background check is currently underway. I have *not* been introduced to my manager or gotten team match confirmation yet, but I've heard that this can often take until a week before your start date at this specific company. Technically the offer could still be rescinded, but I think that's fairly unlikely.\n\nMy start date at the new company is June 9th, and I have a pre-planned europe trip the last half of May. I'm trying to decide between three options:\n\n1. Resign now: Give my full two weeks' notice, finish cleanly, then enjoy my vacation and an additional week completely job-free before starting the new position.\n2. Resign after vacation: Return from my trip and immediately submit my resignation, giving slightly less than two weeks for documentation and handover. This approach would also eliminate any risk of the offer being rescinded while I'm already unemployed.\n3. Sandwich notice period with vacation: Resign one week before vacation, and offer to work one more week after I get back. This would give them a long time to decide what to do, and would hopefully let the background check clear before I give them notice of my departure. The downside is mostly that this would feel kind of weird to me, but maybe it's more normal than I think?\n\nWhat would be the most professional approach in this situation? Any insights from those who have navigated similar transitions would be greatly appreciated. This is the first time I've ever quit a job, so I'm a little lost and anxious here.",

I didn't choose to be in COBOL; that's what they trained and assigned me to and I didn't have anywhere else to go to at that time. I could have left and tried to go for a more useful tech stack after 2 years but the pandemic happened so looking for a new job was impossible. When the pandemic ended, I eventually got to move to a different company and do Java development instead.\n\nMy problem is, I only have 2+ years of professional experience with Java. I've been working for way longer than that but I'm treated more like a mid level developer because my only experience in Java is that long and nobody seems to care about my 4 years of experience in COBOL because to be quite honest, it's a really outdated language. I'm unable to break into the senior developer level in my company because I need more years of experience with Java.\n\nTo make things worse, I have zero work experience in frameworks, APIs, microservices, cloud development, etc. The Java project I worked on didn't have those, or at least didn't have me do work in those. I never got to work on CI/CD or databases because that's not the task I got assigned to. I got to do side tasks like automation with Excel VBA macros but that doesn't seem to be as helpful for my resume as it sounds.\n\nMeanwhile, I see others younger than me get to be 5 years of experience, have experience with things like AWS, microservices, frameworks, RedHat, containers, etc.\n\nDid they just get lucky in their projects and I got unlucky? How do I even ask my manager to put me in a project that allows me to gain experience with cloud development, microservices, frameworks, and all that trendy stuff? There is an opportunity in my company that wants COBOL developers and maybe I could make it as a senior COBOL developer but I fear that it's only going to exacerbate my current issue. How does one even navigate this? I feel like I have to choose between catching up in experience as a Java developer or being a senior COBOL developer in a rapidly declining language.",

My ultimate goal and wish is to be a better software engineer and eventually grow to be a senior someday (I am 27 yo and about to finish my CS degree with a data science specialisation)\n\nIn total I have about 3 YOE, in my previous role I was a fullstack developer working with a Java Spring Boot/Angular tech stack in an agile environment and micro services and it was fun and dynamic but the culture was horrible and eventually burnt me out.\n\nNow I am working in the IT department of a finance related company that used to be very small and recently grew since ~1,5 years but in the IT department the processes haven't really adapted yet. Legacy code base with huge theoretical complexity (Java, Spring, Maven, JavaFX) and a web application that is built in Angular (15-17) built by an external service provider with 5-6 developers from that company that have made software for us for the past 15 years. Me and another colleague were hired so they have internal 'back-up' but the communication is difficult, we don't have any project management basically, very waterfall based, barely any structured work, deadlines or planning. We feel lost about the fact that we were hired to help develop software but the circumstances don't help us grow or be better developers. In fact I feel like I am unlearning everything I learnt at uni because I cannot utilize it in the current architecture that is very customized from the general state of the art approaches I've usually been familiar with. \n\nWe hardly get any support or feedback and it just sucks. Everytime we ask for structural changes and support we have to solve the issues ourselves. We are severly undermanaged and it's really taking a toll on my mental health, work ethic and confidence. I feel kind of depressed to be honest. Everytime I get a spark of hope and optimism and suggest new ideas or ask for more projects or new projects where I can play around and not struggle with the spaghetti codebase, it gets crushed.\n\nI love my coworkers and feel comfortable on a personal level. The pay is good and the job is very safe/stable so I feel so guilty and bad about feeling so lost work wise. I really don't know what to do, I am scared to give up the stability this job gives me but I feel like I am capable of more. I feel very safe here but at the same time I feel like I am wasting away the best years of my career by stagnating in a dysfunctional company. What do I do?\n\n\n\nTL;DR: severly undermanaged and not seeing any possibility to grow and use my skills in current job and feeling guilty about giving up a positive work environment/culture",

Now, I'm working on a .NET enterprise product that's a monolith and plenty of decade-old code. I'm not complaining - it has its fair share of interesting problems too. But it just makes me wonder, since I'm seeing there are relatively more .NET/Java jobs than Go, how much of the industry is \"uncool\"? What percentage of companies are actually having scalability or performance issues and using the hot new tech?\n\nJust for fun, let me compile some topics I think is cool/uncool.

If I take an entry-level IT job, say, helpdesk, after graduation, am I permanently barred from moving into development? I hear that a lot of people in my position in the past have taken helpdesk jobs and worked on their portfolio on the side, eventually landing a dev job.

I enjoyed the small projects a lot, but I don't know how I'll feel about this project by the time I finish it or about the web dev internship. However, I think I have the best chance at this since I'm from a third world country and I think finding jobs in SE would be easier (not easy, just easier).\n\nFor machine learning, I haven't tried anything yet. I have planned a final project for my bachelors, which is going to be an AI customer support agent (a family member has a business and suggested I try making that tool for their business). I don't know anything about ML, but I know it requires a lot of math, and I've been a math nerd since high school (solved about 1000+ math problems in my last year of high school). I also think that ML will be a \"goldmine\" for those who choose it now because I keep seeing online that ML jobs will be in high demand in the future.\n\nI know I'm deciding what I want to do based on my feelings, but I want to choose something that I'm not gonna regret by the time I turn 30. For example, I like some aspects of software engineering, but I do know that many software engineers hate their jobs because of how shit the work environment is in many companies (too many meetings, coding the same shit everyday...etc).\n\nWhat should I base my decision on? Preference? Market state? Opportunities?\n\nAnd how should I know if I actually enjoy any of these (if I should choose based on passion)?\n\nI appreciate anybody who took the time to read this.",

        "content": "I started a new position 30 days ago at an MSP (Managed Service Provider) as a Network Operations Manager.\n\nMy original understanding was that I'd lead infrastructure migration projects at a structured, strategic pace — taking ownership of planning, execution, and building operational discipline.\n\nI knew the environment might be somewhat messy — and I actually saw that as an opportunity to bring structure where it was needed.\n\nBut instead, an existing senior team member (let's call him Mark) immediately flooded the process with urgency:\n\n– Meetings all day, often back-to-back\n\n– Little to no time to plan deeply, reflect, or organize properly\n\n– Constant interruptions and ad hoc requests — expectation to be hyper-responsive\n\n– No official timeline from leadership, but Mark imposed a fast-track timeline anyway\n\nMeanwhile, the CTO — who I technically report to — is largely absent:\n\n– Doesn’t respond to emails\n\n– Doesn’t return calls\n\n– Occasionally appears briefly (e.g., grabbing a sandwich at the airport) but otherwise offers no active guidance\n\nI also hired two team members early on, originally planning to assign them to focused infrastructure projects.\n\nBut with the current chaos, they are now being treated as generalists, expected to somehow cover a wide range of topics, including undocumented environments.\n\nAdditionally, while I was never explicitly told it was a \"cloud-first MSP,\" the way the role was presented (focused on infrastructure modernization and migration leadership) led me to assume it was heavily cloud-oriented.\n\nIn reality:\n\n– Only about 20% of the infrastructure is actually cloud-based.\n\n– Roughly 40% is legacy systems, many undocumented, requiring reverse engineering just to understand what's running.\n\n(For context, during the interview I asked for a website to learn more about the company, and was told they didn’t have one — in hindsight, that probably should have been a red flag.)\n\nThe biggest problem:\n\nI was hired to bring structure, but the current rhythm is so accelerated that trying to implement thoughtful leadership would simply slow things down.\n\nIn short:\n\n– I feel I’ve lost the leadership narrative I was hired for.\n\n– I’m being forced to play at their chaotic rhythm instead of leading with my own structure and pace.\n\nMark himself is extremely intense:\n\n– Wakes up at 3–5 AM\n\n– Eats lunch by 9 AM\n\n– Spends afternoons studying for certifications — while pushing the team at full speed\n\nI was aiming for a leadership role where I could build, structure, and scale — not a permanent crisis-response role in a fragmented environment.\n\nAm I overreacting?\n\nIs this just what IT leadership looks like today?\n\nYou're welcome to criticize me.\n\nI’d appreciate any references:\n\n– Is this 50%, 70%, 90% of IT leadership roles now?\n\n– Is this common across MSPs?\n\n– Or are there still companies where structured leadership and thoughtful execution are respected?\n\n\\-- Does it make sense to stay 2 weeks more, or do you see a long term position worth enduring?\n\nThanks for reading — I’m trying to calibrate my expectations.",

I spent 3 years there until getting hired into a very small startup position as a full stack dev last July.\n\nI am approaching my first year in this position and our senior developer is being poached by our biggest client. I am definitely seeing this as an opportunity to sort of usurp his throne and grow into a more senior developer mindset- even if my experience doesn't say I'm senior-ready.\n\nWith the way the market is right now, I'd think the best play would be to really ride out the position I'm in at the moment especially considering I do not have formal education.\n\nI guess I am just seeking wise words/valuable resources to help me get more into this senior mindset.",
