The assignment itself was pretty straightforward an ETL job. I do not have previous experience working as a data engineer.\n\nI built out some basic tests in Python using pytest. I set up fixtures to mock the boto3 S3 client, wrote a few unit tests to verify that my transformation logic produced the expected results, and checked that my code called the right S3 methods with the right parameters. \n\nThe interviewer were showering me with praise for the tests I have written. They kept saying, we do not see candidate writing tests. They keep pointing out how good I was just because of these tests.\n\nBut here’s the thing: my tests were super simple.  I didn’t write any integration tests against Glue or do any end-to-end pipeline validation. I just mocked the S3 client and verified my Python code did what it was supposed to do. \n\nI come from a background in software engineering, so i have a habit of writing extensive test suites. \n\nLooks like just because of the tests, I might have a higher probability of getting this role.\n\nHow rigorously do we test in data engineering?",

Integration and e2e testing are about the whole integrated pipeline performing as expected. All of those could, in theory, be written as pytest tests (maybe). It’s a “build time” construct, ie *before* your code is released. \n\nData quality checks are about checking the integrity of production data as it’s already flowing, each time it flows.

        "author": "PotokDes",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Recently, I made a post asking: Why don’t data engineers test like software engineers do? The post sparked a lively discussion and became quite popular, trending for two days on r/dataengineering.\n\nMany insightful points were raised in the comments. Here, I’d like to summarize the main arguments and share my perspective.\n\nThe most upvoted comment highlighted the distinction between data testing and logic testing. While this is an valid observation, it was somewhat tangential to the main question, so I’ll address it separately.\n\nMost of the other comments centered around three main reasons:\n\n1. Testing is costly and time-consuming.\n2. Many analytical engineers lack a formal computer science background.\n3. Testing is often not implemented because projects are volatile and engineers have little control over source systems.\n\nAnd here is my take on these:\n\n1. Testing requires time and is costly\n\n**Reddit:** The decision to invest in testing often depends on the company and the role data plays within its structure. If data pipelines are not central to the company’s main product, many engineers do not see the value in spending additional resources to ensure these pipelines work as expected.\n\n**My perspective**: Tests are a tool. If you consider your project simple enough and do not plan to scale it, then perhaps you do not need them.\n\n**Reddit:**: It can be more advantageous for engineers to deliver incomplete solutions, as they are often the only ones who can fix the resulting technical debt and are paid more for doing so.\n\n**My perspective**: Tight deadlines and fixed requirements mean that testing is usually the first thing to be cut. This allows engineers to deliver a solution and close a ticket, and if a bug is found later, extra time and effort are allocated from a different budget. While this approach is accepted by many managers, it is not ideal, as the overall time wasted on fixing issues often exceeds the time it would have taken to test the solution upfront.\n\n**Reddit:**: Stakeholders are rarely willing to pay for testing.\n\n**My perspective**: Testing is a tool for engineers, not stakeholders. Stakeholders pay for a working product, and it should be the producer's responsibility to ensure that the product meets the requirements. If I personally were about to buy a product from a store and someone told me to pay extra for testing, I would also refuse. If you are certain about your product do not test it, but do not ask non-technical people how to do your job.\n\n2. Many analytical engineers lack a formal computer science background.  \n**Reddit:**: Especially in analytical and scientific engineering, many people are not formally trained as software engineers. They are often self-taught programmers who write scripts to solve their immediate problems but may be unaware of software engineering practices that could make their projects more maintainable.\n\n**My perspective**: This is a common and ongoing challenge. Computers are tools used by almost everyone, but not everyone who uses a computer is a programmer. Many successful projects begin with someone trying to solve a problem in their own field, and in analytics, domain knowledge is often more important than programming expertise when building initial pipelines. In companies just starting their data initiatives, pipelines are typically built by analysts. As long as these pipelines meet expectations, this approach is acceptable. However, as complexity grows, changes become more costly, and tracking down the source of problems can become a nightmare.\n\n3. No control of source data  \n**Reddit:**: Data engineers often have no control over the source data, which can lead to issues when the schema changes or when unexpected data is encountered. This makes it difficult to implement testing.\n\n**My perspective**: This one of the assumptions of data engineering systems. Depending on the type of the data engineering system, data engineers very rarely will have a say in there. Only where we are creating the analytical system for the operational data, we might have a conversation with the operational system maintainers.\n\nIn other cases when we are scraping the data from the web or calling external APIs, it is not possible. So what are the ways that we could do to help in such situations?\n\nWhen the problem is related to the evolution of schema (case when data fields are added or removed, data type changes): First we might use schema-on-read strategy, where we store the raw data as they are ingested, for example in JSON format in the staging models, we extract only the fields that are relevant to us. In this case, we do not care if new fields are added. When columns that were using are removed or changed the the pipeline will break, but if we have tests they will tell us what is the exact reason why. We have a place to start investigation and decide how to fix it\n\nIf the problem is unexpected data the issues are similar. It’s impossible to anticipate every possible variation in source data, and equally impossible to write pipelines that handle every scenario. The logic in our pipelines is typically designed for the data identified during initial analysis. If the data changes, we cannot guarantee that the analytics code will handle it correctly. Even simple data tests can alert us to these situations, indicating, for example: “We were not expecting data like this—please check if we can handle it.” This once again saves time on root cause analysis by pinpointing exactly where the problem is and where to start investigating a solution.",

One of the most common examples is the data lake populated with tons of parquet files. How different from each other in data types, number of columns etc are these files? If not very much, why not just throw it all in a pipeline to clean/normalize the data and store the output in a common warehouse?\n2. How *straightforward* it is to use technologies like Iceberg for managing non-tabular binary files like pictures, videos, PDFs etc? Is it even possible? If yes, is this a common use case?\n3.

It looked super slick, and I immediately thought there's no reason on earth to use this with snowflake because of egress (and abunch of other reasons) but it's cool.\n\nSo I decided to build it anyways: Introducing Snowducks\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s50m6as7ge8f1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd6492295dae218aa8ff2d27b517f2992c389903\n\nAlso - if my goal was to just use instant SQL - it would've been much more simple. But I wanted to use Ducklake. For Reasons. What I built was a caching mechanism using the ADBC driver which checks the query hash to see if the data is local (and fresh), if so return it. If not pull fresh from Snowflake, with automatic limit of records so you're not blowing up your local machine. It then can be used in conjunction with the instant SQL features.\n\nI started with Python because I didn't do any research, and of course my dumb ass then had to rebuild it in C++ because DuckDB extensions are more complicated to use than a UDF (but hey at least I have a separate cli that does this now right???). Learned a lot about ADBC drivers, DuckDB extensions, and why you should probably read documentation first before just going off and building something.\n\nAnyways, I'll be the first to admit I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I also don't even know if I plan to do more....or if it works on anyone else's machine besides mine, but it works on mine and that's cool.\n\nAnyways feel free to check it out - [Github](https://github.com/danjsiegel/snowducks)",

The speed at which I could set it up was remarkable—I had DuckLake up and running in just a few minutes, especially since you can host it locally.\n\nOne of the standout features was being able to use custom SQL right out of the box with the DuckDB CLI. All you need is one binary. After ingesting data via sling, I found querying to be quite responsive (due to the SQL catalog backend). with Iceberg, querying can be quite sluggish, and you can't even query with SQL without some heavy engine like spark or trino.\n\nOf course, Iceberg has the advantage of being more established in the industry, with a longer track record, but I'm rooting for ducklake. Anyone has similar experience with Ducklake?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Up until now, Firebolt has been a cloud data solution that's strictly pay-to-play. But today that changes, as we're launching [Firebolt Core](https://github.com/firebolt-db/firebolt-core), a self-managed version of Firebolt's query engine with all the same features, performance improvements, and optimizations. It's built to scale out as a production-grade, distributed query engine capable of providing low latency, high concurrency analytics, ELT at scale, and particularly powerful analytics on Iceberg, but it's also capable of running on small datasets on a single laptop for those looking to give it a lightweight try.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Core and its launch, Firebolt's CTO Mosha Pasumansky and VP of Engineering Benjamin Wagner wrote [a blog explaining more about what it is, why we built it, and what you can do with it.](https://www.firebolt.io/blog/introducing-firebolt-core) It also touches on the topic of open source - which Core isn't.\n\nOne extra goodie is that thanks to all the work that's gone into Firebolt and the fact that we included all of the same performance improvements in Core, it's immediately debuting at the top spot on the [Clickbench benchmark.](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/) Of course, we're aware that performance isn't everything, but Firebolt is built from the ground up to be as performant as possible, and it's meant to power analytical and application workloads where minimizing query latency is critical. When that's the space you're in, performance matters a lot... and so you can probably see why we're excited.\n\nStrongly recommend giving it a try yourself, and let us know what you think!",

My main tasks are integrating customers’ ERP systems with our software and building ETL processes.\n\nNow, I’m about to transition to a new internal role focused on building digital products. The tech stack will include Python, SQL, Snowflake, and dbt.\n\nI’m planning to start learning Snowflake before I move into this new role to make a good impression. However, I feel a bit overwhelmed by the many tools and skills in the data engineering field, and I’m not sure what to focus on after that.\n\nMy question is: what should I prioritize learning to improve my career prospects and grow as a Data Engineer?\n\nShould I specialize in Snowflake (maybe get certified)? Focus on dbt? Or should I prioritize learning orchestration tools like Airflow and CI/CD practices? Or should I dive deeper into cloud platforms like Azure or Databricks?\n\nOr would it be even more valuable to focus on fundamentals like data modeling, architecture, and system design?\n\nI was also thinking about reading the following books:\n\t•\tFundamentals of Data Engineering — Joe Reis & Matt Housley\n\t•\tThe Data Warehouse Toolkit — Ralph Kimball\n\t•\tDesigning Data-Intensive Applications — Martin Kleppmann\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice — especially from experienced Data Engineers.

        "author": "neosisrube",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I moved from a startup into a corporate job ( digital banking ) a few months ago. I’m from Malaysia , for context. I’m still under probation. And honestly, I don’t know anymore if I’m underperforming, or if I’m just stuck in a dysfunctional culture that burns people out.\n\nIn my previous role, I worked as a backend engineer. I had autonomy. Things moved fast. Feedback was immediate. Now, I’m in an environment where expectations are vague, processes are messy, and communication is passive-aggressive.\n\nOne example: we have a support schedule to help vendors load data into internal systems. They can’t do it directly, so someone from our side has to run everything manually. It’s basic, repetitive work , I once suggested scripting it to make the process cleaner. That suggestion was ignored. So we keep doing it the hard way.\n\nRecently I got pinged after working hours to join a “5-minute call to load something” , something that would run for 10 hours. There was no advance notice, just the assumption I’d be available. I was already off shift, but even then, the next day came with a passive-aggressive remark: “Didn’t expect this from you.” This wasn’t the first time either.\n\nThen there’s the feedback I’ve been given. My boss told me twice , that I lack “initiative.” The most recent example was over documentation. I was asked to update some system design docs. I did. I even left a comment inside tagging him, asking for input , which should’ve triggered an email notification. But I didn’t follow up in Teams because I got pulled into other work. I was literally about to update him the next morning when he messaged me and immediately launched into a rant about me needing to be more proactive and take ownership. Even though the work had been done. However, sometime he would dished out praise but rarely. \n\nMeanwhile, I’m putting in 10–15 hour days. I’m exhausted. I forget things. I don’t have any more bandwidth. I’m not even doing meaningful engineering work , just reacting to whatever lands in my inbox or chat window. No ownership, no growth. Just people assuming I’ll pick up anything and everything.\n\nThis is starting to affect my personal life. I carry the resentment home. I’m always tired. I’m checked out even when I’m not working. I literally can’t take a shit without being pulled into a meeting.\n\nSo now I’m asking: is this a sign I’m not fit for this kind of culture? Am I truly missing something basic? Or is this what happens when you take someone from a fast, transparent, builder-type environment and drop them into a place where nobody wants to own problems , they just want someone to quietly clean up the mess?\n\nIf you’ve been through this, I’d appreciate perspective.",

        "author": "Asleep-Rise-473",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**Full disclosure:** I'm part of the team at Databend, and we just published a deep-dive article on User-Defined Functions (UDFs). I’m sharing this here because it tackles a question we see all the time: when and how to move beyond standard SQL for complex logic in a data pipeline. I've made sure to summarize the key takeaways in this post to respect the community's rules on self-promotion.\n\nWe've all been there: your SQL query is becoming a monster of nested `CASE` statements and gnarly regex, and you start wondering if there's a better way. Our goal was to create a practical guide for choosing the right tool for the job.\n\nHere’s a quick breakdown of the approaches we cover:\n\n* **Lambda (SQL) UDFs:** The simplest approach. The guide's advice is clear: **if you can do it in SQL, do it in SQL**. It's the easiest to maintain and debug. We cover using them for simple data cleaning and standardizing business rules.\n* **Python & JavaScript UDFs:** These are the workhorses for most custom logic. The post shows examples for things like:\n   * Using a Python UDF to validate and standardize shipping addresses.\n   * Using a JavaScript UDF to process messy JSON event logs by redacting PII and enriching the data.\n* **WASM (WebAssembly) UDFs:** This is for when you are truly performance-obsessed. If you're doing heavy computation (think feature engineering, complex financial modeling), you can get near-native speed. We show a full example of writing a function in Rust, compiling it to WASM, and running it inside the database.\n* **External UDF Servers:** For when you need to integrate your data warehouse with an existing microservice you already trust (like a fraud detection or matchmaking engine). This lets you keep your business logic decoupled but still query it from SQL.\n\nThe article ends with a \"no-BS\" best practices section and some basic performance benchmarks comparing the different UDF types. The core message is to start simple and only escalate in complexity when the use case demands it.\n\n**You can read the full deep-dive here:** [https://www.databend.com/blog/category-product/Databend\\_UDF/](https://www.databend.com/blog/category-product/Databend_UDF/)\n\nI'd love to hear how you all handle this. What's your team's go-to solution when SQL just isn't enough for the task at hand?",

Our client has multiple contracts with us, and I support one of them. I’ve been interested in moving into data engineering for a while and am about halfway through a master’s in computer and information technology.\n\nRecently, I asked if I could shadow the DE team on an adjacent contract, and they brought me in for their latest sprint. Shortly after, the program manager on that team asked if I’d be interested in applying for an open DE role. I was thrilled—it felt like the perfect opportunity.\n\nI already know the data really well (I worked on their recent migration efforts and use their tables regularly), and I’m familiar with some of the team. It’s a solid internal move with a lot of alignment.\n\nThe catch? I’d have to take a $27K pay cut—from $137K to $110K.\nI expected a cut since I don’t have formal DE experience and would be stepping into a mid-level role, but that number feels steep—especially since I live in a high cost of living area and recently bought a house.\n\n⸻\n\nMy question for you all:\n1. Would you take the job anyway, just to get your foot in the door?\n2. Has anyone else here made a similar internal switch from analyst to DE? How did it work out long-term?\n3. Are there ways to negotiate this kind of internal transition to ease the pay gap? (e.g. retention bonus, hybrid role, defined promotion path)\n4. If I pass this up, how hard would it be to break into DE externally without prior experience or the DE title?\n\nAny perspective—especially from folks who’ve made the jump or hired junior/mid DEs—would really help.

It doesnt matter if you know how to write a loop in some language or how to define a class or anything similar, you just need to be able to realize when you need to iterate over something or express a concept with specific attributes. You can always just reference the syntax later.\n\nI have taken soo many lessons on these things and they all make sense on that day but days later I forget what each of them mean. However, the concept of doing X in a certain way remains.\n\nAm I weird for being this way?  I often feel discouraged when I have to look up a term that other people are using online.

        "content": "**Hello everyone,**\n\nI hope you're all doing well.\n\nI'm reaching out here to ask for some guidance or suggestions as I continue my job search in the data engineering field.\n\nLet me introduce myself briefly. I began my career in 2017 as a junior data engineer and worked in India for 5 years. During that time, I gained solid experience with technologies such as Spark, Airflow, AWS, CI/CD, Kafka, Elasticsearch, SQL, Python, Scala, and a bit of GCP. These form the core of my technical background.\n\nAfter working with two companies in India, I moved to the UK in mid-2022 to pursue a Master’s degree in Data Science. It was a one-year program, and I graduated in 2023 with distinction. Right after graduation, I worked as a Machine Learning Research Assistant in the UK until February 2025. Around that time, I moved to Ireland on a joint visa, and I'm currently settled here.\n\nSince March 2025, I've been actively looking for opportunities in data engineering or software development. I’ve been fortunate to receive interviews from some great companies. I’ll admit, I wasn’t fully prepared for the first two or three, but since then, I’ve put in a lot of focused effort. I'm now quite confident in SQL, Python, and problem-solving.\n\nHowever, it’s now June, and I still haven’t landed a role. I’ve reached the final rounds in 3 or 4 interviews, but unfortunately, the outcomes have been negative. This has been difficult emotionally, and I'm growing concerned about the employment gap it’s creating in my career.\n\nI can feel the competition is intense, especially in the data engineering field. Some people are even surprised that I haven’t secured a role yet, given my 5+ years of experience and a master’s degree. I understand their perspective, but I’m truly doing everything I can.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, guidance, or even just words of encouragement, I would deeply appreciate it. If you were in my position, what would you do? I’m starting to feel like my career is slipping away, and any support would mean a lot to me right now.\n\nThank you so much in advance.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a new grad analytics engineer at a startup, working with a simple data stack: *dbt + Redshift + Airflow*.\n\nMy manager recently asked me to optimize `VARCHAR` lengths across our dbt models. Right now, we have a lot of columns defaulted to `VARCHAR(65535)` — mostly due to copy-pasting or lazy defaults when realistically they could be much tighter (e.g., `VARCHAR(16)` for zip codes).\n\nAs part of the project, I’ve been:\n\n* Tracing fields back to their *source tables*\n* Using a mix of *dbt macros* and a *metadata dashboard* to compare actual max string lengths vs. declared ones\n* Generating ::VARCHAR(n) casts to replace overly wide definitions\n\nA lot of this is still manual, and before I invest too much in automating it, I wanted to ask:\n\n# Does reducing VARCHAR lengths in Redshift actually improve performance or resource usage?\n\nMore specifically:\n\n* Does casting from VARCHAR(65535) to something smaller like VARCHAR(32) *improve query performance* or *reduce memory usage*?\n* Does Redshift allocate memory or storage *based on declared max length*, or is it dynamic?\n* Has anyone built an *automated DBT-based solution* to recommend or enforce more efficient column widths?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts or experiences!\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

I’ve been working at the same company with an on-prem mssql DW.\n\nThe DW has been painfully mismanaged since long before I started. Among other things, instead of using it for analytics, many operational processes run through it where no one was bothered to build them in the source systems.\n\nI don’t mind the old techstack, but there is also a lot of operational legacy. No git, no code reviews, no documentation, no ownership, everyone is crammed which leads to low collaboration unless explicitly asked for. \n\nThe job however, have many upsides too. Mainly, the new management since 18 months have recongnized the problems above and are investing in a brand new modern data platform. I am learning by watching and discussing. Further, I’m also paid well given my experience and get along well with my manager (who started 2 years ago).\n\nI have explicitly asked my manager to be moved to work with the new platform (or improve the issues with the current platform) part time, but I’m stuck maintaining legacy while consultants build the new platform. Despite this, I truly believe the company will be great to work at in 2-3 years. \n\nHave anyone else been in a similar situation? Did you stick it out, or would you find a new job? If I stay, how do I improve the culture? I’m situated in Europe in a city where the demand for DE fluctuates.",

        "author": "Certain_Leader9946",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I've built a system where Spark Connect runs behind an API gateway to push/pull data from Delta Lake tables on S3. It's been a massive improvement over our previous Databricks setup — we can transact millions of rows in seconds with much more control.\n\nWhat I want now is user authentication and access control:\n\n* Specifically, I want certain users to have read-only access.\n* They should still be able to submit Spark SQL queries, but no write operations (no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.).\n\nWhen using Databricks, this was trivial to manage via Unity Catalog and OAuth — I could restrict service principals to only have SELECT access. But I'm now outside the Databricks ecosystem using vanilla Spark 4.0 and Spark Connect, which I want to add, has been orders of magnitude more performant and easier to operate, and I’m struggling to find an equivalent.\n\nIs there any way to restrict Spark SQL commands to only allow reads per session/user? Or disallow any write operations at the SQL level for specific users or apps (e.g., via Spark configs or custom extensions)?\n\nEven if there's a way to disable all write operations globally for a given Spark Connect session or app, I could probably work around that for my use case by leveraging those applications at the API layer!\n\nWould appreciate any ideas, even partial ones. Thanks!!!\n\nEDIT: No replies yet but for context I'm able to dump 20M rows in 3s from my Fargate Spark Cluster. I then make queries using [https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.toLocalIterator.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.toLocalIterator.html) via Spark Connect (except in Scala). This lets me receive the results via Arrow and push them lazily into my Websocket response to my users, with a lot less infra code, whereas the Databricks ODBC connection (or JDBC connection, or their own libs) would take 3 minutes to do this, at best. It's just faster, and I think Spark 4 is a huge jump forward.\n\nEDIT2: While Spark Connect is a huge jump forward, using Databricks Connect is the way we are thinking about going with this (as it turns out Databricks connect is just a wrapper with Spark connect so we can still use the local instance as local development and have Databricks hoist our Spark cluster on the cloud; still maintaining the benefits; and as it turns out you can connect to Databricks compute nodes with Spark Connect vanilla and be fine).",

        "author": "caleb-amperity",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,\n\nMy name is Caleb, I am the GM for a team at a company called Amperity that just launched an open source CLI tool called [Chuck Data](https://chuckdata.ai). \n\nThe tool runs exclusively on Databricks for the moment. We launched it last week as a **free** new offering in research preview to get a sense of whether this kind of interface is compelling to data engineering teams. This post is mainly conversational and looking for reactions/feedback. We don't even have a monetization strategy for this offering. Chuck is free and open source, but just for full disclosure what we're getting out of this is signal to drive our engineering prioritization for our other products.\n\n# General Pitch\n\nThe general idea is similar to Claude Code except where Claude Code is designed for general software development, Chuck Data is designed for data engineering work in Databricks. You can use natural language to describe your use case and Chuck can help plan and then configure jobs, notebooks, data models, etc. in Databricks. \n\nSo imagine you want to set up identity resolution on a bunch of tables with customer data. Normally you would analyze the data schemas, spec out an algorithm, implement it by either configuring an ETL tool or writing some scripts, etc. With Chuck you would just prompt it with \"I want to stitch these 5 tables together\" and Chuck can analyze the data, propose a plan and provide a ML ID res algorithm and then when you're happy with its plan it will set it up and run it in your Databricks account.\n\nStrategy-wise, Amperity has been selling a SAAS CDP platform for a decade and configuring it with services. So we have a ton of expertise setting up \"Customer 360\" models for enterprise companies at scale with any different kind of data. We're seeing an opportunity with the proliferation of LLMs and the agentic concepts where we think it's viable to give data engineers an alternative to ETLs and save tons of time with better tools. \n\nChuck is our attempt to make a tool trying to realize that vision and get it into the hands of the users ASAP to get a sense for what works, what doesn't, and ultimately whether this kind of natural language tooling is appealing to data engineers.\n\nMy goal with this post is to drive some awareness and get anyone who uses Databricks regularly to try it out so we can learn together. \n\n# How to Try Chuck Out\n\nChuck is a Python based CLI so it should work on any system. \n\nYou can install it on MacOS via Homebrew with:\n\n    brew tap amperity/chuck-data\n    brew install chuck-data\n\nVia Python you can install it with pip with:\n\n    pip install chuck-data\n\nHere are links for more information:\n\n* Git repo: [https://github.com/amperity/chuck-data](https://github.com/amperity/chuck-data)\n* Website: [https://chuckdata.ai](https://chuckdata.ai)\n* Launch video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3BBaLPYukA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3BBaLPYukA) \n* Discord: [https://discord.gg/f3UZwyuQqe](https://discord.gg/f3UZwyuQqe)\n\nIf you would prefer to try it out on fake data first, we have a wide variety of fake data sets in the Databricks marketplace. You'll want to copy it into your own Catalog since you can't write into Delta Shares.  [https://marketplace.databricks.com/?searchKey=amperity&sortBy=popularity](https://marketplace.databricks.com/?searchKey=amperity&sortBy=popularity)\n\nI would recommend [the datasets in the \"bronze\" schema for this one specifically](https://marketplace.databricks.com/details/6bc4843f-3809-4995-8461-9756f6164ddf/Amperity_Amperitys-Identity-Resolution-Agent-30-Day-Trial).\n\n  \nThanks for reading and any feedback is welcome!",

        "author": "thro0away12",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm somebody who worked as a data analyst, data scientist and now data engineer. I guess my role is more of an analytics engineering role, but the more I've worked in my role, it seems the future direction is to make my role completely non-technical, which is the opposite of what I was hoping for when I got hired. In my past jobs, I thrived when I was developing technical solutions in my work. I wanted to be a SWE but leap from analytics to SWE was difficult without more engineering experience, which is how I landed my role. \n\nWhen I was hired for my role, my understanding was that my job would be that I have at least 70% of the requirements fleshed out and will be building the solution either via Python, SQL or whatever tool. Instead, here's what's happening:\n\n* I get looped into a project with zero context and zero documentation as to what the project is\n* I quite frankly have no idea or any direction with what I'm supposed to do and what the end result is supposed to be used for or what it should look like\n* My way of building things is to use past 'similar projects', navigate endless PDF documents, emails, tickets to figure out what I should be doing\n* I code out a half-baked solution using these resources\n* I get feedback that the old similar project solution doesn't work, that I had to go into a very specific subfolder and refer to a documentation there to figure out something \n* My half-baked idea either has to revert back to completely starting from scratch or progressively starts to bake but is never fully baked \n* Now multiply this by 4, plus meetings and other tasks, so no time for even me to write documentation. \n* Lots of time, energy gets wasted in this. My 8 hour days have started becoming 12. I'm sleeping as late as 2-3 AM sometimes. I'm noticing my brain slowing down and a lack of interest in my work. but I'm still working as best as I can. I have zero time to upskill. I want to take a certification exam this year, but I'm frequently too burnt out to study. I also don't know if my team will really support me in wanting to get certs or work towards new technical skills. \n* On top of all of this, I have one colleague who constantly has a gripe about my work - that it's not being done faster. When I ask for clarification, he doesn't properly provide it. He constantly makes me feel uncomfortable to speak b/c he will say 'I'm frustrated', 'I wanted this to be done faster', 'this is concerning'. Instead of constructive feedback, he vents about me to my boss and their boss. \n\nI feel like the team I work on is very much a firm believer that AI will eventually phase out traditional SWE and DE jobs as we know today and the focus should be on the aspects AI can't replace, such as us coming up with ways to translate stakeholder needs into something useful. In theory, I understand the rationale, in practice....I just feel translation aspect will always be midly frustrating with all the uncertainties and constant changes around what people want. I don't know about the future though, whether or not trying to upskill, learn a new language or get a cert is worth my time or energy if there won't be money or jobs here. I can say thugh those aspects of DE are what I enjoy the most and why I wanted to become a data engineer. In an ideal world, my job would be a compromise between what I like and what will help me have a job/make money. \n\nI'm not sure what to do.

        "content": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI'm wondering if someone here can help me piece something together. In my job, I think I have reached the boundary between data engineering and data science, and I'm out of my depth right now.\n\nI work for a government contractor. I am the only data scientist on the team and was recently hired. It's government work, so it's inherently a little slow and we don't necessarily have the newest tools. Since they have not hired a data scientist before, I currently have more infrastructure-related tasks. I also don't have a ton of people that I can get help from - I might need to reach out to somebody on a totally different contract if I wanted some insight/mentorship on this, which wouldn't be impossible, but I figured that posting here might get me more breadth.\n\nVaguely, there is an abundance of data that is (mostly) stored on Oracle databases. One smaller subset of it is stored on an ElasticSearch cluster. It's an enormous amount that goes back 15 years. It has been slow for me to get access to the Oracle database and ElasticSearch cluster, just because they've never had to give someone access before that wasn't already a database admin.\n\nI am very fortunate that the data (1) exists and (2) exists in a way that would actually be useful for building a model, which is what I have primarily been hired to do. Now that I have access to these databases, I've been trying to find the best way to work with the data. I've been trying to move toward storing it in parquet files, but today, I was thinking, \"this feels really weird that all these parquet files would just exist locally for me.\" Some Googling later, I encountered this concept of a \"data lake.\"\n\nI'm posting here largely because I'm hopeful to understand how this process works in industry - I definitely didn't learn this in school! I've been having this nagging feeling that \"something is missing\" - like there should be something in between the database and any analysis/EDA that I'm doing in Python. This is because queries are slow, it doesn't feel scalable for me to locally store a bunch of parquet files, and there is just no single, versioned source of \"truth.\"\n\nIs a data lake (or lakehouse?) what is typically used in this situation?",

        "content": "I'm not talking about Gen AI doing data engineering work... specifically what does data engineering look like for supporting Gen AI services/products?\n\nBelow are a few thoughts from what i've seen in the market and my own building; but I would love to hear what others are seeing!\n\n1. A key differentiator for quality LLM output is providing it great context, thus the role of information organization, data mining, and information retrieval is becoming more important. With that said, I don't see traditional data modeling fully fitting this paradigm given that the relationship are much more flexible with LLMs. Something I'm thinking about is what are identifiers around \"text themes\" an modeling around that (I could 100% be over complicating this though).\n\n2. I think security and governance controls are going to become more important in data engineering. Before LLMs, it was pretty hard to expose sensitive data without gross negligence. Today with consumer focused AI, people are sending PII to these AI tools that are then sending it to their external APIs (especially among non-technical users). I think people will come to their senses soon, but the barriers of protection via processes and training have been eroded substantially with the easy adoption of AI.\n\n3. Data integrations with third parties is going to become trivial. For example, say you don't have budget for Fivetran and have to build your own connection from Salesforce to your data warehouse. The process of going through API docs, building a pipeline, parsing nested JSON, dealing with edge cases, etc takes a long time. I see a move towards offloading this work to AI \"agents\" (loaded term now I know), but essentially I'm seeing traction with MCP server. So data eng work is less around building data models for other humans, but instead for external AI agents to work with.\n\nIs this matching what you are seeing?\n\nedit: typos",

Since all these servers are in LAN, storage is mounted via nfs on both trino worker and coordinator and hive catalog server. When I create table from trino, It creates it, and acts as a success, even when later i insert values into it and select it, it acts as everything is normal, even selecting .\"table$files\" works as expected showing correct path. But when I check the path its meant to be writing into, its empty. as I create a table, an empty folder with table name and uuid is created, but no data/metadata inside. Most likely it is being cached somewhere, because if i reboot the trino server (and not restart trino, bcz that does not change it), the message says: \n\nQuery <id> failed: Metadata not found in metadata location for table <table\\_name>\n\nbut cant create same table before I drop current one. BTW, dropping the table is also success, but does not remove the folder from the original storage.

I am 22, and super willing to learn more in my free time, luckily my work environment isn’t soulcrushing but I want to make something of the opportunity.

However, despite all my efforts, I’m starting to feel pretty dumb. It seems like everyone around me (especially the younger folks) is just picking it up so easily, and I’m struggling to even understand the basics sometimes.\n\nI guess I just feel a bit discouraged. Maybe I’m too old for this? But I really don’t want to give up just yet.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation or can offer advice on how to keep going? Any tips on how to break through the initial confusion? Maybe a different learning approach or resources that worked for you?\n\nThanks in advance, I appreciate any help!",

It was my first interview since graduation, and I was told the initial round would be focused on communication and a basic introduction. However, once the call began, they asked me to share my screen and write a piece of code: print all the prime numbers up to 50 using a for loop.\n\nIt sounded simple enough, something I should’ve been able to do effortlessly. But the moment I began typing, I blanked out. I couldn’t recall even the basic syntax of JavaScript or Python. I could hear their laughter in my own head, even though no one mocked me directly. It was deeply embarrassing.\n\nIn that moment, I started questioning my skills and every decision that brought me here. I’ve built several projects, some quite complex, like an image size compressor but none of that mattered when I failed to write a basic loop. Maybe it was the nerves, or maybe I just froze under pressure. I’m not entirely sure.\n\nI don’t know if it’s appropriate to share this here, but I felt the need to. This experience shook me. I realize now that I need to revisit the basics, not out of shame, but because I owe it to myself to rebuild with confidence.",

What would you recommend?\n\nI struggle with keeping myself motivated when it comes to learning theory, but when I'm in an environment that is more structured, with tests and deadlines I'm better at following through, so I've been thinking of enlisting in a couple of classes at my local community college, however as those tend to be pretty expensive, I would like to hear any alternatives you might have.\n\nThank you all!",

I want to internalize how JS/HTML/CSS work together in the browser, when I know frameworks literally were designed to solve the problems I'm facing.\n\nExample: I've spent this whole week trying to build a custom select input. If I had gone straight to React, I could have taken advantage of react select and would be farther ahead by now. Instead, I'm losing my mind fighting every bug trying to build a UI from scratch. Frameworks are definitely on my roadmap, but I'm not there yet.\n\nI'm desperate to learn and eventually transition into a fullstack role, but given my lack of degree, I feel like I'm wasting time.\n\nWhat is the \"right\" way to learn how to be a modern developer? Does learning the manual, \"old school\" way not cut it in 2025?",

The CEO was very upfront about everything, there is nobody here that knows anything about coding, I would be the only one that maintains the main product of the company and he understands that I have to learn a lot before I become an expert.  \nAfter a few days of thinking about it and talking to teachers and an acquaintance of mine I thought that this is a great opportunity to learn and become competent in a wide variety.\n\nIt's my third month now and I still don't know what I am doing. We just started coding TicTacToe in School and at work I am currently (stuck at) rewriting a standalone part of the project with roughly 5k Lines, integration into multiple third-party services and a device developed by us. To my shame I have to admit I have vibecoded a large chunk of it.  \nNow I am stuck on two projects, where the solutions seems like it would be solved by someone with actual experience within two hours.\n\nDid I fuck up, or is there some place I can get somebody that is somewhat knowledgeable in our tech stack to sit down with me for a day and explain some basic concepts?\n\nThanks if anybody has some advice, and also thanks if you tell me that I'm an idiot that plunged himself too deep into the waters.\n\nEdit: Techstack is React, C#, hosted on Azure. Project I'm stuck on is an update from .NET3(in process) to .NET8(isolated worker), since the .NET3 pipeline fails to build. ",

But with AI tools now, where you can have help writing code and explanations, is it different?\n\nHow much of actual programming do you really need to memorize these days? Is it enough to just understand what’s happening at a high level, to know what you’re trying to do and why it works, and just look up the details as you go? Or is it still important to know all the algorithms, data structures, and other fundamentals in order to really be a programmer and write solid code?\n\nI guess I’m trying to compare it to math class, where it felt like they acted as if you’d never be allowed to use a calculator or look something up, when in reality you could.

        "content": "I see a lot of posts, particularly from people trying to learn about the dangers of AI. I think it's very easy to misuse it but there are a few simple things we can all do to keep ourselves growing. The issue with AI is that it's answers are too easy so they don't \"stick\" in your mind.\n\n1) Never copy and paste code. This applies to tutorials as well. The act of typing will help you remember. Pair this with consciously thinking about everything you type and scrolling through IDE intellisense suggestions.\n\n2) Always ask for an explanation. Even for simple things, just reading the explanation can help your brain.\n\n3) Get familiar with documentation. AI can spit out an answer, but it isn't necessarily giving you the best answer. Looking at docs (if they are good) will show you different ways of using certain features or components. Alternatively, ask AI for different options and explanations of what works best in what situations.\n\n4) Ask about design patterns and Strategies rather than specific code snippets. This has helped me a ton. It's easy to find an article about why x is better than y, but the reality is most of the time each strategy fits a different requirement better and sometimes it's about how you want to build your system. \n\n5) if you don't need AI, don't use it. Even if it takes you a little longer to do something, forcing your brain to recall something will signal to your brain that that information is important and we should keep it. If you overly rely on AI, your brain will stop retaining the information. The same thing happens in a relationship. If your partner is responsible for feeding the pets, it's hard for you to remember. That is shared memory and it happens with AI.",

        "content": "Hey, I’d love to hear experienced developers opinion on this as it’s shaped how ive continued to teach myself to code but after reading people’s posts on here, its making me think it wasn’t great advice ..\n\nSo I did 16 week bootcamp last summer. My lecturers were software engineers at top companies and gave so much valuable advice and insight into what it’s actually like working as a software engineer. But whilst learning, they said it’s not important for us to know and fully understand everything, it’s just about us knowing that these things exist and so when we would get the job, we aren’t unfamiliar with certain tech vocab and we can just search it up in the job. \n\nSo right now I’m about to start React with TOP. But in the back of my mind I know that when it came to the async topics for eg, I didn’t fully understand it and it’s just in the back of my mind.  \nI’d typically just make sure I’m somewhat familiar with it and then just move on. I’ve read the docs but don’t fully get it. I don’t know if me wanting to fully 100% get it is my perfectionist side and therefore perhaps slightly pointless when considering the advice my lecturers gave, or if me having a decent grasp on it is a enough and now I can just move on. \n\nI’d really appreciate hearing people’s opinion on this :)\n\n",

I’ve been watching beginner tutorials and reading some basics, but I’m still confused about one thing…\n\nShould I focus on mastering just one language (I'm currently eyeing Python), or should I learn multiple languages—even if I won’t be able to master all of them right away?\n\nI know programming isn’t a walk in the park, and I don’t want to overwhelm myself. But I’m also worried that I might fall behind in college if I focus on only one language. Some say it’s better to go deep with one, while others say exposure to multiple is helpful.\n\nSo to the students who’ve been through this or anyone already in the field, what helped you most when you were starting? \nAny advice or insights would be super appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance! 🙏🏻",

It’s been a steady job, but I’ve hit a point where I really want to progress, earn a better salary, and feel like I’m actually growing in my career. The problem is — I feel completely stuck and unsure of the right direction to take.\n\nI dabbled in web development years ago (HTML, CSS, a bit of jQuery) and had a couple of jobs back in the 2010-12s, but tech has moved on so much since then. Now I’m looking at everything from JavaScript frameworks like React, to modern build tools, version control, APIs, and responsive design — and honestly, it feels like a huge mountain to climb. I worry I’ve left it too late.\n\nPart of me thinks I should go down the cloud or cybersecurity route instead. I’ve passed the AZ-900 and looked into cloud engineering, but I only know the networking basics and don’t feel that confident with scripting or using the CLI. AWS also seems like a potential direction, but I’m just not sure where I’d thrive.\n\nTo complicate things, I suspect I have undiagnosed ADHD. I’ve always struggled with focus, information retention, and consistency when learning. It’s only recently I’ve realized how much that could be holding me back — and making this decision even harder.\n\nWhat triggered all this is seeing someone I used to work with — he’s now a successful cyber engineer in his 20s. It hit me hard. I know it’s not healthy to compare, but I can’t help feeling like I’ve missed the boat.\n\nI’m torn:\n\t•\tIs web dev too layered and overwhelming to break into now?\n\n\t•\tCan someone like me still make a comeback and get hired in this field?\n\n\t•\tOr should I pivot to something more structured like cloud or cyber, where maybe the learning path is clearer?\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice from those who’ve been through a similar fork in the road — especially if you’ve changed paths later in life or dealt with ADHD while trying to upskill.\n\nThanks for reading.

I never clicked with OOP, hated the assignments, and the professor only reads the lecture slides. The exams are written on paper, so writing code and class designs by hand under time pressure always messes me up. I have to average at least fifty percent on tests and final otherwise im done. If you’ve found any resources or study routines that actually helped you understand inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, or just got you through an on paper Java exam, let me know. Any advice/tips advice would really help. Thanks.",

I don’t have much prior experience although I did learn some HTML and Python back in school, but I’ve forgotten most of it, so I’m essentially starting from scratch.\n\nThe good thing is that I’m completely free until the end of July (will be joining college after that), so I want to make the most of this time and give it my full focus. I do have a few questions and would appreciate your advice:\n\n1. What should be my ideal roadmap or study plan to cover CS50 efficiently in this time frame?\n2. How many hours should I ideally dedicate each day, considering I want to complete as much as possible before July ends?\n3. Are there any particular lectures or concepts that generally require extra attention or are tougher to grasp?\n4. Would you recommend taking notes? If yes, should I write down everything the professor says, or focus on key points? Also, is it better to keep digital notes or go old-school with pen and paper (I don't have prior experience of making digital notes but I need to learn)?\n5. How does submission of problem sets and projects work?\n6. Are there any specific tools or software I need to install beforehand?\n7. How does the free certificate process work? Is it automatic or do I need to register separately?\n8. Any extra advice, personal experiences, or tips you’d like to share would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks a lot in advance! Would love to hear from folks who’ve completed or are currently taking the course.",

You're gonna save yourself a lot of future pain with an inversion of control architecture or even just sensible use of service interface wrappers. i.e. your controller (or whatever) calls a middleman interface which in turn calls the third-party sdk (or whatever) for a particular feature; so come time to replace that external service with an alternative you only need to update the interface once.\"\n\nCan you post any good resources to help me out?",

I have a solid foundation in Python, have built a few personal projects (both frontend and backend), and am actively improving my skills through hands-on learning, online courses, and consistent practice.\n\nHere’s a quick background:\n\nI come from an Electrical Engineering background\n\nI’ve been self-learning Python, Django, basic frontend (HTML/CSS/JS), and a bit of data science (Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)\n\nI'm working on improving my GitHub profile and portfolio\n\nI post regularly about my learning journey to stay accountable\n\n\nWhat I need help with:\n🔹 Where should I apply? (besides the usual LinkedIn/Indeed)\n🔹 What kind of projects would actually help me stand out as a Python/Full Stack beginner?\n🔹 Are internships still worth chasing, even unpaid ones?\n🔹 Any tips to crack that first break without formal experience?\n\nI’m not afraid of putting in the work, I just need direction from people who’ve been where I am now. Any advice, feedback, or even tough love is welcome.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Here’s my story.\n* When I started preparing for DSA and coding interviews, I thought I was being smart by exploring all possible resources.\n* I went down the rabbit hole,  watched one YouTuber’s playlist, switched to another when I didn’t feel productive, jumped from LeetCode to Codeforces to GFG and back. I even spent days reading Reddit threads and Quora answers trying to “find the best roadmap.”\n* Guess what? I wasted 3 full months doing just this. Minimal progress. Constant overwhelm. I wasn’t practicing,  I was just researching how to practice.\n* It hit me hard when my senior told me: The best resource is the one you actually stick to.\n* That’s when things changed. I picked one creator whose teaching style I liked. I stopped second-guessing and stuck to their roadmap. Within weeks, I saw more clarity and growth than I had in the past few months.\n* Here’s what I learned: You don’t need 10 resources. Give yourself 1-2 days max to pick a creator/platform. Then stop looking. Start solving. That’s where the growth is.\n* Don’t fall into the trap that the next video or roadmap will finally unlock it. Progress doesn’t come from finding the perfect guide, it comes from showing up and putting in the reps.\n\nIf you’re just starting out, learn from my mistakes. Pick one solid resource. Trust it. Stick with it for at least a few weeks. You’ll thank yourself later.",

I’d like to start with a simplistic thing to create a GUI on a WinPC or RHEL setup, then I should be able to move from there if I can get my inputs and outputs aliv.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I work at a fairly established but small company that had about 200 people when I started. Now it’s down to about 120. No layoffs but there’s been some people singled out and fired, and a ton of churn.  I suspect a lot of problems here are happening in the industry as a whole. \n\nFor product and eng it’s 100% driven by low engagement and burnout. I only started here in August but it’s been a straight trend of just doing everything wrong. New product leader came in around when I did. Slowly ripped away any authority that ICs/managers have to define their scope or what to prioritize. It’s extremely top-down, do whatever the cofounders want now, and that was fairly insulated when I started. They’ve pushed out any and all leadership that were a source of any friction at the top, and I think they saw this new leader they hired was gonna validate anything they say. Now it’s only yes-people in the room. Teams and reorgs constantly happen at whims of leadership without really consulting anyone. This then impacts roadmap items but the expectations don’t change. Roadmap itself is never even really committed too, cause they change priorities there all the time, you never know when or why the thing you were working on for three weeks will get deprioritized. You also don’t know when something you thought you’d do a month later you’re now expected to present a prototype of at the end of the week. A lot of expected overtime work, not a lot of pay or advancement opportunity. Definitely a lack of clarity or support on directions given. I’ve seen people ask valid questions get put on PIPs basically. \n\nAs a designer I can definitely say this is not a place I expect to do great work or anything I can really showcase. The top down mandate is quite simply, AI-wash the product. I worked on a project with that mandate, just impossible constraints and no scope clarity. So I had to challenge that team to really turn this into something that customers would value and pay for and set a small target. With the full support and backing of my manager we really pushed to make sure it’s at least providing real value to the user, compromised as quickly as possible when necessary to unblock Eng (we were all building the plane while flying it). We really inserted ourselves so that we don’t make terrible UX decisions even and especially when that made things a little harder. Worked really hard on it, set a bar for quality. Executives swooped in last two weeks before launch and started asking for tons of changes, same timeline. So, lost time QAing there that really would have made a difference. Delayed the launch. They freaked out and blamed everyone they were pushing to work 80 hour weeks for a month to get this done. An eng quit on the spot which I applaud. Sure enough it launched and immediately sold enough to make the company profitable for its first quarter in like two years. Did we get any additional respect or acknowledgement, maybe some trust and respect for our process? lol. Well, that product leader got all the credit somehow despite having very little involvement. They got a promotion, and my manager, the one really backing me up challenging them and the team, got demoted, so no design voice in the leadership room now. This is the same product leader who’s entire staff either quit or been let go since they joined, and a replacement hired for most of them. Despised by everyone in product, design, and eng now. Yet, great at rubbing shoulders with management and pleasing them. Way too small of a company for politics like that to really work, but sure enough they convinced founders that they’re the goat. \n\nThey have multiple engagement surveys where we’ve basically flatlined to zero on product side since that leader started. Feedback has been given calling out leadership as the source. None of the driving behavior changed or was addressed by them, it only got worse. Then Eng started to feel the impact of this over the last 6 months. A lot of them started quitting, the best ones that had been there longest and had most domain knowledge. most recent engagement shows a big dip for them now too. Def cannot replace them faster than they quit right now and it’s an existential risk. It’s looking like the ship is gonna sink itself here. \n\nI’m also just wondering if there’s greener grass or is this just how the industry is gonna be for a while? Business idiots running everything into the ground with zero accountability, and ICs treated like disposable resources who can be replaced by AI if they go. It’s frustrating cause if they actually empowered us a bit more, we have the talent and means of making a great product that actually sells, but it’s like their own egos take priority and they can’t conceive of anyone knowing the business opportunities worth investing in other than themselves. Down to the micromanaged details, like they don’t trust or value the expertise they hired. \n\n",

I am 10x more productive with copilot etc. I was laid off and thanked by the CTO for my work the next day in early Jan 2025.\n\nI initially wanted remote roles due to my remote backround, but its not happening. For the past few months Ive tried onsite roles as well. The only responses I get are from recruiters who message me on Linkedin about local onsite roles to the city I listed and I didnt even apply to their jobs. The city I live in is a tech hub so its not like I live in the middle of nowhere. \n\nI had a recruiter message me about a meta contract job around $200k, but that got put on hold by Meta for undisclosed reasons. I had another fang type job do the same. Another recruiter ghosted me after they reached out lol. And thats about it. \n\nIve applied for 1,000+ jobs at this point in soft eng, product management, devops, and eng manager roles. I dont have any connections left that can help. I messaged people I know working at Google, Amazon, etc. \n\nI regret doing CS. I had expectations when I started CS that this point in my career I could find a new job quickly. Even for $40k a year jobs which Im not even getting responses for. \n\nI did premed in my ugrad(chem bio ochem etc. on top of CS) Im confident I can apply and be accepted. Carribean MD is the fallback. \n\nMany complain about how doctors go to school for so long and make so little, but I went to school for just as long(my masters thesis took a while) and I had a 3 year \"residency\" first job for $60k a year, I broke six figures post covid and at this point Im making $0.

Had that canon event we all seem to be going through of not being able to find anything.\n\nFast forward 8 months post-grad, I cave and take a QA Engineer position. My thinking was that I'd take the route of automating everything I can to impress the devs and join them at the company, but no such luck. My company is mostly foreign, with about 70% of the staff being Chinese... including the entirety of the devs. I don't speak Chinese, and there's a blatant opportunity/ compensation bias towards my Chinese coworkers. Nonetheless, I get a few Automation certs, make a couple projects specifically for the company's benefit with the previous stack, and it gets me nowhere. A \"Thank you! Now get back to work\", and a 2% annual bump in my salary. So, while still trying to create applications/software to benefit my company, my main work has been devolved into manual testing. I'm desperately doing anything I can to code. But I feel like I've got the QA brand on me now after this long.\n\nThen I get home, see 3-5 more rejections from the prior days applications, apply to 15-20 more, leetcode, work on projects/ certs, go to the gym and lift out my frustration, and go to bed. It's been like this for **2 and a half years** now, and I'm losing my mind. I spend most of my days feeling like an absolute failure, and hating myself over this, and it's effecting my relationships because people are picking up on it now. I see friends/ acquaintances of the same age buying homes, having kids etc., that went right into the trades after high school. And I'm still living at my parent's place. I just feel so incredibly cheated and disheartened that those 4 years in college and countless post-midnight study grind sessions, along with all of the extra effort post-grad haven't gotten me anywhere.\n\nI just don't know what to do. I don't want to be a CEO. I'm not applying to FANG or anything like that. Just all normal, average companies. I don't care to be wildly rich. I just want to be able to comfortably support a future family, and buy a house for them, and live out the American Dream. That's literally it, and I spend so much time being bitter about that being so far away right now. I'm just so tired of hating myself and feeling like a failure. It shouldn't be like this.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I am a ~~Senior~~ Backend Engineer who has never made it past Junior. I got fucked over by two jobs in a row over the past 4 years which held me back. Its a long story so I'll try to keep it somewhat short (because oh boy there is so much more I could talk about).\n\nThe first one was one I held for 3 years. The company was tumultuous and there was high turn over, and a year into the job, half of the engineers were gone and replaced, and by year 3, I was the longest tenure engineer at the company. When I first started there, we had no titles besides Software Engineer and Senior Software Engineer. 2 years in, they decided they wanted to be more like other companies and decided to implement bands. At this point, I was doing system design, db design, security, re-architecture work, introducing process changes, leading meetings, mentoring, etc. I was pushing to get a promotion, because I was doing way more senior work than other seniors in the company, but I was told that they were making a rubric and had frozen promotions for 6 months.\n\nSo, 6 months go by and we have this new salary/title band system, and we get a new HR system as well. I don't think too much of it until one day I go to submit some time off, and under my profile name, it says \"Software Engineer I\", the lowest title level. I'm stunned and go look at the org chart and out of 40 engineers, I am the ONLY ONE who is a Software Engineer I. I bring it up to the engineering manager and he tells me to just go through the review process and it should be fixed with the new rubric. So review time comes around and I finally get the rubric that I had been asking for for a month, and the new rubric ends up blocking my promotion.\n\nWhy? Because whoever made the rubric decided one of the requirements to go from Engineer I to Engineer II is that you have \"Taken responsibility when your changes were responsible for a critical error\". Problem is, after 2.5 years, I never introduced a show-stopping bug. I was the only engineer in the company who never introduced a show-stopping bug. So apparently, I failed that requirement, so they weren't going to give me a promotion. I ended up getting laid off with a bunch of other people 6 months after.\n\nThen last year, I started working a job that was supposed to be a Senior Engineer position, but even though I did great on the interviews, because my previous position wasn't as a \"Senior\", they wouldn't give me the senior title. At this point, things were starting to get pretty bad with the job market and I was desperate, so I took it. Ended up getting laid off again with people late last year.\n\nNow, with how bad the market has gotten, I am struggling to get any traction. I am one of those devs who truly loves writing software, and I've loved it since I first tried it out in high school just for fun. I'm not the most genius engineer or anything like that, but I truly love it, and its not about the money for me. But these past 4 years have really killed my drive and motivation. Now here I am, barely getting any traction while job-searching for months, and since every job posting out there is for Senior+, I'm getting filtered out of jobs left and right. At this point, should I just \"lie\" (or rather, correct what titles I should have had)?",

I can do the work, but the amount of hours I have to put in to keep up with the workload is wearing on me mentally and physically. I have also spent nearly 1/4th of the past 4 years actively on call.

I have been trying to get back to defense but the fact my clearance expired since switching to tech has made that very difficult. All the open positions require an active TS/SCI and mine expired nearly two years ago. Have not found a position willing to sponsor yet.\n\nI am ultimately looking for something that I can just put in my 40 hours a week an call it a day with no on-call. Not really worried about the pay cut that will entail.\n\nI know government in general is good for that, but with the current administration not really optimistic about getting a gov job.\n\nWhat are some good industries that would provide a similar level of WLB to defense?",

        "content": "So a couple of years ago I wrote a script that did some clever tricks with the clipboard to streamline the otherwise manual effort of data population into an excel worksheet.  I mainly wrote it for myself because I absolutely despise repetitive work, but word got around when I showed it to ONE person and I was persuaded to turn it into a standalone GUI tool.  \n\nEventually that task I entirely automated wasn't my responsibility anymore as I got a promotion and went to work on other projects.  The individuals that wound up handling that task/responsibility heavily used my tool until it didn't work anymore because the structure of the source data changed, and the way the tool was written wasn't dynamic.  So of course, they reach out to me to update it.  \n\nI didn't really have time to update that thing, but they'd become so spoiled, I said okay.  So I rewrote it.  I implemented some pretty rudimentary data structures so it was dynamic and would work with any modifications to the source data.  I also implemented some fuzzy matching so it would populate accurately regardless, whether there were differences in case or trailing spaces or whatever.  One of the guys in the role decided to ask me for a walk through, because apparently, he has a CS degree.  He looked through the code of the older version (static/hard coded) and the new version (dynamic/fuzzy) and said he didn't understand the updates --so he was going to work with the first one.  \n\nFast forward to yesterday and he's giving a \"demo\" on his \"updates\".  On that call were members of management, eagerly anticipating something inventive and/or innovative from some supposed collaborative effort.  I join the call late because I was super busy, but when I get on, he's walking through the logic, workflow, and data structures that I wrote in the first and second version.  I'm sitting there like.. hmm.. this sounds like all of the functionality I built, and I'm wondering if I should air him out and let the entire group know.  Of course I didn't because I'm better than that, but I did ask what improvements or updates he made (that constituted the meeting).  The only thing he changed was swapping out one Excel read/write library for another, because the one I used (xlswriter) overwrites formulas in cells.  \n\nAnyway, so while the tool isn't all that much of a big deal, because, I pretty much hacked it together in a couple of hours altogether to save myself some time, I can't help feeling a little petty about this dude passing along my work as his own.  It's one thing to show the tool's usage, it's another to walk through the logic to upper-management, like he wrote the damn thing.  AITA for even caring at all?",

Currently I'm interested to continue progressing as an IC but I have zero interest in management, because I hate having to have that responsibility and sitting in meetings all day long sounds horrid.\n\nMy concern though is that above senior, it seems your responsibilities end up becoming cross-team. With that sounds like a lot of stress. The people I work closely with that are above senior seem like they're always busy throughout the day and even get pinged oftentimes post 5 or 6PM. Feels like they always have a ton on their plate to do both in terms of coding, designs, attending meetings, etc. And the ones I know even still feel like their output outside of meetings is high. Like their brain is just completely on for the entirety of the work day, something I cannot do.\n\n\nI hope to progress above Senior but I don't want to have to sacrifice a ton of WLB for that. Currently I enjoy my WLB. I work remotely, start at like 9-9:30 and end at 5-6, depending on if I have impromptu meetings (my personal policy is end independent work at 5 but if someone needs to meet with me I can stretch until 6, especially since my team is in CT or PST). I completely ignore any pings before/after and that's not a problem. I feel like with my current workload in my team and company, I can progress in my career while still having sufficient brain breaks throughout the day, and at least in my team, there's good support and little pressure.\n\n\nAt risk of sounding greedy, my current TC is around like $200k~ but I hope to reach like $300k+ in <7 years, without having to kill myself with work and stress for it. I also have problems with anxiety which is pretty bad in high-pressure, hectic environments that I assume a lot of higher level engineers have to deal with given their responsibilities. I know other companies can pay that amount of mid-level and seniors...but they also work you to the bone. I want to know if my prospects are too idealistic, hence why I'm asking if engineers above senior here can pitch in and let me know how their WLB experiences have been like. Obviously it's company and team dependent but I assume there's a level of similarity between companies given a similar breadth and depth of responsibilities.\n\n\nAnd I guess a second question to my main one is if you guys think (if you can even predict the future) that the answers to my first question are even relevant like 7+ years down the line.",

I also didn't get a FAANG internship during my studies (But I worked a 16 month internship at a big named non-tech company)\n\nI love coding on my own time and have a handful of portfolio projects in C++ game/engine development and web dev (I focus on this less, since I'm now doing it at my job) which helped me land my first job.\n\nI've been working at my current company for a year now, and have been doing full stack work. It's a tiny company, and the pay is nothing to write home about (I'm living with my dad since I can't afford rent in my city) I'm learning a lot though, and there's many opportunities to lead feature initiatives within the company which is nice for a first job. I can recognize there's no room for growth here beyond that though.\n\nMy issue is not really knowing how to keep progressing my career. I keep seeing TikTok/Reels of the thousandth ivy league student happy about their internship/return offer to Meta or Citadel or something. These posts saturate social media to the point where it seems like the only paths to wealth are: Get a big tech internship while in school and land a return offer, make a 7 figure startup, or be banished to irrelevancy.\n\nI'm interested in those of you that were (are) in my shoes; what would you recommend someone like me do to keep progressing their career and land a reputable job in some big tech company? Is it just a matter of experience and interview prep, or should I be doing more like getting a masters?  And does anyone have good advice to help with the anxiety of comparing yourself to those seemingly more successful/younger than you?\n\nThank you!",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I’m looking for people who might have gone through what I’m going through right now, and how they overcame it. I recently graduated college so I haven’t seen most of the world as of yet. \n\nI’m a Junior dev right now. 2 years of experience - this is the first and only place I’ve worked at. And it’s the only team I’ve worked with. I joined here straight out of college. \n\nLately l have begun realizing just how emotionally invested I’ve become in this workplace. I’m so scared that this attachment will cause me to harm my own career as I would be resistant to switching jobs in the future, if I don’t fix this. \n\nFirst off, I have the best manager ever. Obviously I don’t have any reference points, as this is my first manager, but hearing stories from my friends - I consider myself to be pretty lucky. My manager is always pushing me to be the best, other senior leadership has told me that my manager talks very good about me to them, she is always available to explain things and is stern when I make mistakes. I’ve never been pinpointed or blamed for when Prod issues have happened, just reminded that these are very important incidents to learn from. I work in a finance heavy industry, so I had to learn A LOT about finance, and she taught me all of it. \n\nSecond, my team is flexible. We aren’t expected to log in early if the need isn’t there. My manager is also fine with me taking multiple consecutive days off together if need be. We aren’t too personal with each other and I like the boundaries that everyone maintains. \n\nThe work itself - it’s not tooooo interesting. I do work in finance, so it’s hard for me to accept what I’m doing actually matters. It feels like a zero sum game to me. The problems we solve with engineering have more to do with reducing the manual work for finance bros. So I always feel like I’m working underneath them as opposed to with them. The work hours can also stretch to 9/10 hours a day, sometimes.\n\nThe end users of the product are a pain in the ass. They are the finance bros and they have an attitude problem. I do not like working for them or along with them. They don’t understand the complexity of software systems. They think just because a feature sounds so simple in their head it’s simple to build as well. \n\nThe top-layer engineering leadership is also uninspiring. Their only motivation is (and they’ve spoken this out loud multiple times) to keep the finance bros happy and not lose our credibility in front of them. It feels like my job only exists to please them. \n\nWhich is why in my head I want to change jobs, maybe look for something more interesting, fun and inspiring. But then I’m reminded of my star manager and amazing team. What if I’m actually very lucky where I am right now? What if I change jobs and it’s a stupid decision? I could be stuck somewhere where the manager is ass and working against me. I don’t know what to do. Is your guys’ work like this as well? ",

Currently, I am doing unpaid research under a PhD research student, which is work I'm sort of interested in, but man is it demoralizing to do it while also knowing the other undergrads working with you are getting paid full time for it.\n\nI transferred to my 4 year from a community college where I had one funded research experience and worked as a CS tutor. But I've never been able to land an internship.\n\nLately, I keep thinking.. what if it just never happens? What if I don't get a job? I didn't get one this summer, what makes me think I'll get one next summer? When I was getting rejected in Fall, I coped by thinking of having Winter and Spring left to get an opportunity. Welp.. It is summer now and I've just been rejected more. I really don't know what to do. I guess I'm just sad and recognizing I may not succeed at being financially stable and living a happy life.

        "content": "TL;DR, I finished my first year of my Computer Science degree poorly and I’m considering switching to Humanities/Political Science or something similar (which I am definitely more interested in), but I have concerns related to opportunities, income, work, etc.\n\nI’m 19 (turning 20), from New Brunswick, Canada. I always liked technology and thought I’d do well pursuing a computer science but after doing my first year in two parts, I’m honestly not sure.\n\nEnded my year with only a 2.5 GPA. Surprisingly I did meh in my other classes but still passed (C’s, B-‘s) profs were probably generous, but I did horrible in my Java class and got a D, so I’d have to retake it. Overtime I feel like I’ve grown disinterested in Java and as much as I tried in the classes (along with my other ones), but there’s just no way I can catch up on pace especially given the fact that during classes I also had to work part time 20 hours/week to help my family with rent/utilities/etc. I ended up relying a lot on “online tools” more than I’d like to admit, as disappointing as it is to the integrity of my university. Hate to make excuses but I really would dedicate more time to my studies if I didn’t have to work so much, I live with a single parent who is lower income and I have to help out.\n\nThat being said, I’m wondering if I should change my major to Political Science or a related field, like maybe History or something in the Humanities field. My best class was an A- in Sociology, which I took as an Elective. I also went to a political science professor’s lectures often out of interest, and he’s pretty damn good. I sometimes engaged more than the people actually taking the course did.\n\nPolitics or History (particularly Canadian) something I’ve grown extremely interested in over the past few years now and I’m pretty knowledgeable on Legislative matters. I’ve used newspaper archives often and contributed to hundreds (and personally written 100+) of encyclopedic texts about New Brunswick related topics on Wikipedia, so it’s probably clear I have much more of an interest in Humanities/Politics/History than I do CS. If you’ve read anything New Brunswick-related on WP chances are I’ve contributed to it in some shape or form. I’d be interested in maybe some sort of Government position but I’m just concerned about job opportunities for that field. \n\nWhichever route I take, I’ll have to take out a student loan due to being low income. I do feel pretty disappointed in myself for making these sort of considerations after a year though; I had used up all of the RESP money saved up for me towards something I performed so poorly in and I’d feel even more behind on life than I already do if I were to switch.\n\nAny potential advice?

        "content": "I have done B.Tech in CS and graduated in 2022 and I landed a FAANG internship. I thought a full-time offer was practically a sure thing.But then, no full-time offer materialized because of team structuring. Still, I secured an SDE-1 role at a major tech company, earning a solid 14-18 LPA.\n\nWithin a year, I left the work as the work wasn't challenging me as there was literally zero work related to actual product development / core software engineering, the culture felt stagnant and I was hungry for more.\n\r\nAfter leaving that SDE-1 role without any full-time offer, I pivoted to a freelancing role while prepping for the interviews for full time role alongwith DSA, System Design etc.\n\nI interviewed with 50+ companies including Google, Amazon, Zomato etc last year for the initial 7-8 months period.The Google interview was four months of pure emotional journey. I aced the first two tech rounds with \"Strong Hire\" and  “Hire” ratings, the third round got completely derailed with a \"No Hire\" for the technical part and rated \"Hire\" for Googlyness by the same interviewer. After this they ghosted me for two months without any 'team matching' calls. In my Amazon interview I sailed through their technical rounds but got rejected in the leadership evaluation. Out of five companies where I actually cleared all the interview rounds, four of them just straight-up ghosted me. The single offer I did receive was a massive 40% below my previous salary and demanded relocation. I declined it.\n\nAfter this period while freelancing I earned what I used to make from my previous salary within two months. Here, I took a break from job searching as it was draining me mentally. But after three months, reality hit when the freelancing projects dried up. I decided to upskill (enrolled in Harkirat's 100xdevs cohort) for full-stack development.  Six months later, I'm only about 70% through the course. The freelancing money, my savings is now exhausted with only 3 months runaway.\n\r\nI've spent the last year grinding, working on my weaknesses. I've gone from zero to four to five production-ready MERN stack applications. I've genuinely evolved from an AI trainer(freelance work) to a full-stack developer.\n\r\nAfter these interviews, I figured out that three main issues consistently held me back:\r\n1. Role Mismatch: Companies just couldn't reconcile my AI training background with traditional SDE roles.\r\n2. Short Tenure: Leaving my first job within a year constantly came up.\r\n3. Weak Dev Skills (Back Then): Honestly, I just couldn't demonstrate core software engineering capabilities during technical rounds. API building, database schemas, system design.\n\r\nNow, I'm at a crossroads. I'm facing some big challenges:\n\r\n1. The CTC issue: My freelance income was hourly and in USD. When I mention my 25-30 LPA expectations, recruiters often ghost me. Should I anchor to my last full-time salary?\r\n2. Market Reality Check: With roughly 3 years of experience and this diverse background, is 25-30 LPA even realistic in today's market?\r\n3. Strategic Focus: Do I cast a wide net (remote, YC startups, EU, Dubai based) or grab the first decent Indian offer for stability?\r\n4. Ethical Job Title: During my freelance period, I applied my new full-stack skills to personal projects. Can I legitimately frame this as \"Contract Software Engineer (Full-Stack)\" on my resume, or is that crossing a line?\r\n5. Unable to get calls: Despite applying actively, I’m struggling to get interview calls and even when recruiters reach out those calls are not converted to interviews.\n\r\nTo anyone who's been here, or helped someone through similar crossroads: what would you do?\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n2022 grad with 3 YOE (6 months of internship +1 yr FTE + 1.5 yrs freelance). Interviewed at 50+ top firms cleared 5, ghosted by 4, lowballed by 1. Took a break after a high-pay freelance gig; now out of work and savings running low. Built solid MERN stack projects. Need advice on CTC strategy, resume positioning, target companies, and rebuilding momentum.",

While work hours and pay is decent, it is only a contract role, career progression is very slow if converted, and I have very little interest in my current industry. So I am looking to job hop in the next couple of years.\n\nI am competent at front end, but I struggle with backend tasks as I lack exp. I often require guidance on how to do stuff like Kafka streams, microservice programming in C#, SQL Schema configuration etc. In fact, it has come to the point where my team lead has stopped giving me backend tasks altogether, saying that I should just focus on front end for now, which was demoralising for me.\n\nI am definitely concerned for my future plans to job hop as I feel the competition. You have:\n\n1. Highflyer CS fresh grads who have tons of hackathon, internship and project exp who memorise all of Leetcode, and can easily land jobs at MNCs/Big Tech\n2. Offshore foreign devs who can do a junior’s work at a fraction of the cost and with more work hours\n3. AI LLMs which can streamline all the work of multiple junior devs\n\nMeanwhile there is me who cant even land a permanent role after uni grad and cant do backend coding to save his life.\n\nI am considering what to do at this point. My original idea was to read up on the side and do another web dev project tied to cloud services to showcase my fullstack skills, for a cause/industry that I’m passionate in. But the competition and job economy for devs will just not get easier from now on.\n\nRealistically however, would it be better for me as an average dev to eventually pivot to project management instead? From what I read, PM roles rely more on industry domain knowledge and soft skills, of which fresh grads, offshore devs, or AI LLMs would tend to not be as strong in. I do have some project leadership exp from various CCA and volunteering opportunities in the past. And of course, this still allows me to work on tech related projects.   \n  \nCan anyone advise me on this? Much appreciated.",

        "content": "I graduated in May 2025 but I have had basically no success in applying to places, most of the time I don't even get the screening phone call and there's only been a few times where I went anywhere further than that. I'm starting to feel like I won't ever get any actually good job at all.\n\nMost positions I see have hundreds of applicants, which makes me think I'll never get in any of them. I am not a top 0.1% candidate, I don't have million dollar side projects, years of experience or a lot of charisma. Plus, there are not a lot of new grad openings in my area (Indiana) and I'm pretty sure I get filtered out of any applications I make to anywhere outside of the state (exactly 0 places out of state actually went further than the first application before throwing my resume in the garbage). Obviously it's a bad idea to move somewhere else without a job lined up, but pretty much everywhere is only hiring locally? There's also the problem where more recently it seems like all the entry level stuff has completely dried up, I only find one thing every few days at this point (everything else seems to want people who are 3+ years of experience in everything for something that says \"entry level\") (Even when I look for random low level help desk and other things they want people with a ton of experience always, and also they want \"excellent communicators\" which is something I am not)\n\nMy [resume](https://imgur.com/a/xnfQFTn) is pretty bad but there's nothing significant I can change about it. The internships I got in college weren't really very computer science oriented (a lot of hardware stuff) which is just a big red flag on my resume I can't do anything with (sidenote: company A is like 1 guy so I probably can't go back there for a job, it's also not very programming based so I don't want to do it forever either). (sidenote 2: Yes I tried to get other internships, but my resume was even worse back then and the market wasn't exactly much better back then versus now). It probably looks bad that I had internships in the summer only but company A is a local place so I can't exactly stay there while going to college. I don't have metrics for everything which makes it look bad (are interns really supposed to be doing corporate espionage to look at company records to see the exact dollar value of everything they did?) (And I can't really lie and make up stuff since that would just look like obvious lies, some of the metrics I already have are already like that)\n\nI had a 3.93 GPA for my bachelors but that isn't actually very good (one of the people that interviewed me actually grilled me for not having a perfect 4.0, probably a reason I got rejected). Project wise I just have some projects on there, but those projects aren't \"real\" projects since 2 of them were class projects and the other one is something that didn't make money so companies probably just see it as just a random toy project. I'm also not an expert in all the 10 random technologies that get put in every job posting as well, which probably leads me to getting tossed out (even if I was, companies probably ignore everything that wasn't something I did in internships which cuts me out of 99% of positions)\n\n(My parents want me to apply to every random X years of experience position out there, which just seems pointless since in what world would I be put above the people who actually have X years of experience?)\n\n**Other things**\n\n* Networking\n   * Networking is a complete non starter as I don't have the social skills to ever convince someone that I'm the best person for the job. My personality is pretty unlikeable (very introverted, don't like talking, not really capable of showing enthusiasm) and I have very little in common with other people\n   * The people I've encountered in my classes aren't really going to help me either (presumably most of them are now entry level people as well and so they have 0 influence on the hiring process of any company)\n   * There's basically 0 chance I become the hiring managers best friend and become someone they push ahead of other people\n* Internships\n   * Not in college anymore, internships only take current students\n* Projects\n   * Making a \"good project\" isn't something I can just do. To make the kind of project that actually impresses employers I would have to make a significant amount of money, and those kind of ideas are very hard to come by. Plus, that kind of thing would take 1 year or several years to actually produce which I can't exactly spend that amount of time unemployed (or in some menial dead end job) without leaving me stuck in that job because they think I can't do anything better\n* Do more leetcode\n   * 99% of the time I don't even get to a point where they even give me any kind of technical evaluation, so it doesn't really help me to practice that more. It's not something I can put in a job application to get further\n* Move somewhere with more jobs\n   * Terrible idea, I don't have a ton of money to waste moving out somewhere (especially considering how badly my job search is going, moving somewhere else isn't going to magically be 100x better)\n* Lie on resume\n   * Also a complete non starter. I don't have the charisma to back up lies on my resume. Stretching experience numbers is something I'm already doing, but I can't just make up years of experience out of nowhere without making it look like obvious lies\n   * If I say I have experience at X place then that would get seen in a background check and then I get thrown out immediately\n\n\n\n",

I believe a second job would be better since sticking around for at least a year would show commitment but I'm unsure if that matters given my professional experience is so limited.\n\nWhile I have been looking and applying I feel pretty stuck/limited so any guidance on switching jobs or where to look for a completely asynchronous second job would be extremely appreciated.",

        "content": "I've got 17 YOE but self taught, primarily frontend.\n\nI haven't been doing DSA a long time but I understand the most common ones I see in interviews (and honestly in my entire career I've rarely gotten LC in an interview, and yes I do think it's important for FE).\n\nw/ LC or any algo problem on any site, the problem I've found is I spend way too much time correcting for edge cases, or smaller bugs, and then I end up butchering my original solution to fit. It never fits, n this just tells me I don't actually know the algo well enough.\n\nI've developed some newer habits while prepping for some upcoming interviews, and I find that this approach I can learn the mechanics of the problem thoroughly and surprisingly I get success only after a couple clicks.\n\nI still spend a lot of time sussing out my solution, but in the end I feel like I really understand what to do.\n\nBasically:\n\n* I read the problem and based off what I currently know I just try to work it out in my head. I don't even write anything down. I just try to visualize it, with my current set of tools. A lot of walking around the house, talking to myself.\n* After I kinda adjust everything in my head, I open up AI chat and then i tell it my approach. I don't ask for code, I just want it to tell me what it thinks of my approach\n* I go back and forth repeatedly with AI on this. Until I have a better sense of what I want to code. Rinse & repeat, I still haven't written or asked for code\n* If i can't formulate something then I go to YT and look for a short on how the problem is generally solved - Neetcode is great for this because he'll visualize it for you before diving into code. I try to make sense of it before seeing how he solves the problem, but if it clicks then i don't even bother, but he does write in python often - I'm primiarly JS/TS so its nice that i still have to do the translation in my head\n* Then I finally start writing my approach and since I've gone over it repeatedly in my head, I have better direction. Your IDE will identify most of the silly bugs so, you just need to return something - this is my own IDE, not in LC's code editor.\n* When I'm done, I don't even run it - I just have AI review it and tell me again where I\"ve messed something up. Again, no code, just more back and forth with AI. Maybe I find that there's prob a better approach, so I redo my solution.\n* When AI (claude in my case) says it looks good, then I finally run it in leetcode/whatevercode. Usually there's minimal things i need to fix. I've been getting successful submits on the first try\n\nTLDR\n\nThis is basically me, a visual learner, self taught - drilling into my head what I think will be a solid approach based off what I actually understand well. The repetition and being corrected _in discussion_ is really really good for me. A lot more time is spent thinking about the problem and talking through the different parts of the solution. The least amount of time is on the code, and there's almost no trial and error clicking. Feels great.\n\nThe funny part is I don't really have the patience to go through the entire AI response, so I kinda skim just for \"this is where the problem is\". I don't even read the whole thing because I try to connect the dots of what its suggesting, on my own.\n\nAnyway, hope this helps. And yes, it's midnight on a Friday, and I'm workin on DSA.

        "content": "Hello good people.\n\nLike the title says I work for a typical megalomaniac, micromanaging, exploitive manager. I don’t mind it too much as I’m in good terms with her and she mostly leaves me the fuck alone because 90% of the time I close out all my tickets.\n\nI’ve been working on this project that uses a LLM model to generate some output, but I don’t think it’s the right project to solve with LLMs because of the inconsistencies/inaccuracies generated in the output. But my manager seems to be convinced that we can make it work, we just need to try harder (improve the prompt, adjust the code, etc.) My company has zero experience building AI products wants to jump in the AI bandwagon and my manager wants to impress c-suite folks by solving business problems with AI. I have voiced my concerns several times how we are trying to solve a problem with the wrong tool or how we should change our approach as the project requires a more deterministic output. I have been ignored everytime and was either asked to just “improve the process a little more” or “don’t think too much, it’ll be fine”. I put duck tapes here and there and the end product is shit. My manager convinced me its fine as long as we make efforts in a positive direction, and at the end if we can’t build this there’s no real repercussions. Long story cut short we are few months into the project and I had to demo the app to the client we are building this for and they weren’t impressed with the inconsistencies in the output. Because at the end of the day it’s nothing like what my manager promised them and they are on our asses to build a working solution ASAP.\n\nAt this point I think you can guess who’s on the hook for all of this? Fortunately the concerns I have expressed to her during the initial phase of the project is documented in emails. But at my company upper management doesn’t want to hear/doesn’t care if your direct manager is being a dick/is incapable and they tell you “you need to figure this out with your manager. Ain’t there nothing I can do about this”. So between me and my manager they’ll just take her word against mine (even with email proof) as I’m more “dispensable” in their eyes? If this project fails more than likely I’ll be blamed and let go as I’ve no doubt she’ll use me as a scapegoat.\n\nWhat’s my move here? I can’t just work harder during the weekends and crank this out. Really need your advice so I can form a strategy. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

MS-AI at UT Austin- Total cost: 10k + fees\n\nI have a feeling the UPenn one would help my resume more than the UT Austin one, but am not sure if it’s going to be worth paying three times as much. Im a little worried that either of these programs won’t actually be taken seriously, but I am genuinely interested in learning more about AI even if it doesn’t help advance my career much which is why I’m leaning towards the UT Austin one. Does anyone have experience with either of these programs and have recommendations? \n",

My three years of experience are at a non “top tier” company, but a decently solid company (I’ve been making >$100k this whole time) \n\nI’ve been working as a frontend dev at the same company for over 3 years now. I’ve touched a decently wide variety of fronted technologies (react, redux, web components, etc). But have genuinely only done frontend dev work this entire time.\n\nI’ve tried bringing up potentially taking on a more fullstack role. But basically I just get told I’m too important in my current position and we always have a backlog of frontend work blah blah blah. \n\nAt this point though I’m starting to get worried, because I’ve tried looking for a new job and am finding it VERY difficult (basically impossible) to get interviews for frontend dev positions. Entry level positions don’t pay enough, and I’ve literally never even gotten a call back about a senior dev position.\n\nThe first step I’m taking is to get an AWS cloud cert. I know these are basically meaningless, but it’s only $100 and I think it will round out on of the edges of my resume well. \n\nI’ve created several personal project backends before using python and MuSQL. But I’m hesitating to just start dumping hours into making java/C++/whatever project backends. Particularly these days because I could literally just have ChatGPT pump out those endpoints in literally seconds. \n\nAnyway basically I’m curious what other steps people think I should take to my myself more employable? Or should I just focus on sticking it out 2 more years until I have a better chance at senior dev roles. (Trying to look past what I see as a consensus negative outlook on how Ai will impact frontend devs in general over the next 2 years…)",

        "author": "aDoge",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I’m torn between taking a job offer I just received, or staying in my current position, and I could really use some help making a decision.\n\n**Background:** 3.5 YOE as an AI/ML engineer (US citizen), 1.5 years at current company\n\n# Current Position\n\n* AI engineer at unicorn startup (lesser-known)\n* $200k base + 10-25% performance bonus\n\n# New Offer\n\n* Founding ML engineer at pre-seed B2B healthcare/pharma startup\n* $195k base + 0.75% equity\n* May be able to negotiate a small signing bonus\n\nSo purely from a TC perspective, I'd be sacrificing 5k base pay and \\~20-50k bonuses for 0.75% equity.\n\n# Key Considerations\n\n**Stability Concerns:** Current company has had back-to-back layoffs this year, and the product I'm working on isn't viable in its current form. There's a potential pivot opportunity, but it's unclear if leadership will pursue it or cut losses. I'm confident in job security through Q1/Q2 2026, but beyond that is uncertain.\n\nThe startup obviously carries its own risks - they have one year of runway and are planning a $4-6M seed round in 2026. If they fail to raise, I’d be cooked.  But I do think they have an acceptable shot at hitting their fundraising goal – the CEO is a previous founder; both the CEO and CTO are Ivy grads in their late 30s with a lot of relevant industry experience; the business model makes sense; they have customers lined up, with each contract bringing in between 300-500k in revenue (contracts are not typically recurring).\n\n**Learning & Growth:** My current role has limited learning opportunities. While I have a strong new manager, the learning is sporadic rather than structured. Our well-staffed DE and DevOps teams mean I'm siloed in applied AI work, and we're focused on low-hanging fruit rather than challenging problems due to company priorities.\n\nThe startup role would give me hands-on MLOps and data engineering experience since I'd be building infrastructure from scratch. The downside is less mentorship and smaller data volumes compared to what I could potentially work with at my current company.\n\n**Long-term Goals:** Like many in this field, I'm aiming for Big Tech eventually. I've seen founding engineer experience listed as a plus on some roles (including at OpenAI/Anthropic), but I'm concerned about having enough time to prep for technical interviews at an early-stage startup.\n\n**Job Hopping Concerns:** Leaving after 1.5 years feels early, especially since my previous role was just under 2 years. Worried about appearing like a job hopper.\n\n**Looking for advice on:** How to weigh these tradeoffs, particularly the loss in TC, the stability/learning balance, and whether the founding engineer experience outweighs the potential downsides.\n\nThanks so much for reading.  I welcome any perspective.",
