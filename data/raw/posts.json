(Creating simple, wide tables so non-technical users can build dashboards without complex joins).\n3. Governance/Consistency?

We, the data engineers that doing the migration do not have any permission to see the production data. Hence for development, we rely on sandbox env of the SaaS app that filled with dummy data and just hope it will works in production. If there are any problem in prod migration? we need to get approval from security team, and then need to sit down with the data owner and then fix it there. ",

But that \"general-purpose\" nature comes with costs: layers of abstraction, context switches, complex locking, and safety checks. For a high-performance database, these are pure overhead.\n\nDatabase devs have been fighting this for years with heroic efforts:\n\n* Building their own buffer pools to bypass the kernel's page cache.\n* Using io\\_uring to minimize system calls.\n\nBut these are workarounds. We're still fundamentally \"begging\" the OS for permission. We can't touch the real levers of power: direct page table manipulation, interrupt handling, or privileged instructions.\n\n# The Two \"Dead End\" Solutions\n\nThis leaves us with two bad choices:\n\n1. **\"Just patch the Linux kernel.\"** This is a nightmare. You're performing surgery on a 30-million-line codebase that's constantly changing. It's incredibly risky (remember the recent CrowdStrike outage?), and you're now stuck maintaining a custom fork forever.\n2. **\"Build a new OS from scratch (a Unikernel).\"** The idealistic approach. But in reality, you're throwing away 30+ years of the Linux ecosystem: drivers, debuggers (gdb), profilers (perf), monitoring tools, and an entire world of operational knowledge. No serious production database can afford this.\n\n# Our \"Third Way\": Virtualization for Empowerment, Not Just Isolation\n\nHere's our breakthrough, inspired by the classic [Dune paper (OSDI '12)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usenix.org%2Fconference%2Fosdi12%2Ftechnical-sessions%2Fpresentation%2Fbelay). We realized that hardware virtualization features (like Intel VT-x) can be used for more than just running VMs. They can be used to **grant a single process temporary, hardware-sandboxed kernel privileges.**\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* Your database starts as a normal Linux process.\n* When it needs to do something performance-critical (like manage its buffer pool), it executes a special instruction and \"enters\" a guest mode.\n* In this mode, it becomes its own mini-kernel. It has its own page table, can handle certain interrupts, and can execute privileged instructions—all with hardware-enforced protection. If it screws up, it only crashes itself, not the host system.\n* When it needs to do something generic, like send a network packet, it \"exits\" and hands the request back to the host Linux kernel to handle.\n\nThis gives us the best of both worlds:\n\n* **Total Control:** We can re-design core OS mechanisms specifically for the database's needs.\n* **Full Linux Ecosystem:** We're still running on a standard Linux kernel, so we lose nothing. All the tools, drivers, and libraries still work.\n* **Hardware-Guaranteed Safety:** Our \"guest kernel\" is fully isolated from the host.\n\n# Two Quick, Concrete Examples from Our Paper\n\nThis new freedom lets us do things that were previously impossible in userspace:\n\n1. **Blazing Fast Snapshots (vs. fork()):** Linux's fork() is slow for large processes because it has to copy page tables and set up copy-on-write with reference counting for every single shared memory page. In our guest kernel, we designed a simple, epoch-based mechanism that ditches per-page reference counting entirely. **Result: We can create a snapshot of a massive buffer pool in milliseconds.**\n2. **Smarter Buffer Pool (vs. mmap):** A big reason database devs hate mmap is that evicting a page requires unmapping it, which can trigger a \"TLB Shootdown.\" This is an expensive operation that interrupts every other CPU core on the machine to tell them to flush that memory address from their translation caches. It's a performance killer. In our guest kernel, the database can directly manipulate its own page tables and use the INVLPG instruction to **flush the TLB of only the local core**. Or, even better, we can just leave the mapping and handle it lazily, eliminating the shootdown entirely.\n\nSo, to answer your question: a full-blown \"Database OS\" that replaces Linux is probably not practical. But a **co-designed system where the database runs its own privileged kernel code in a hardware-enforced sandbox** is not only possible but also extremely powerful.\n\nWe call this paradigm \"Privileged Kernel Bypass.\"\n\nIf you're interested, you can check out the work here:\n\n* **Paper:** Zhou, Xinjing, et al. \"Practical db-os co-design with privileged kernel bypass.\" SIGMOD (2025). (I'll add the link once it's officially in the ACM Digital Library, but you can find a preprint if you search for the title).\n* **Open-Source Code:** [https://github.com/zxjcarrot/libdbos](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzxjcarrot%2Flibdbos)\n\nHappy to answer any more questions",

        "content": "We recently took a dive into comparing Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg, especially for batch analytics and ML pipelines, and I wanted to share some findings in a practical way. The blog post we wrote goes into detail, but here’s a quick rundown and the approach we took and the things we covered:  \n  \nFirst off, both formats bring serious warehouse-level power to data lakes think ACID transactions, time travel, and easy schema evolution.That’s huge for ETL, feature engineering, and reproducible model training. Some of the key points we explored:  \n  \n\\-Firstly, the delta Lake’s copy-on-write mechanism and the new Deletion Vectors (DVs) feature, which streamlines updates and deletes (especially handy for update-heavy streaming). ﻿ \n\n\\- Iceberg’s more flexible approach with your position/equality deletes and a hierarchical metadata model for a fast query planning even across a lot(millions) of files.  \n  \n\\- We also covered the partitioning strategies where we have Delta’s Liquid Clustering and Iceberg’s true partition evolution and they let you optimize your data as it grows.   \n  \n\\- Most importantly for us was the ecosystem integration iceberg is super engine-neutral, with rich support across Spark, Flink, Trino, BigQuery, Snowflake, and more. Delta is strongest with Spark/Databricks, but OSS support is evolving.  \n  \n\\-Case studies went a long way too where we have doordash saved up to 40% on costs migrating to Iceberg, mainly through better storage and resource use.Refer  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRKHEA8-3bYFinal)   \n  \nthoughts:  \n\\- Go Iceberg if you want max flexibility, cost savings, and governance neutrality.  \n\\- Go Delta if you’re deep in Databricks, want managed features, and real-time/streaming is critical.We covered operational realities too, like setup and table maintenance, so if you’re looking for hands-on experience, I think you’ll find some actionable details.  \nWould love for you to check out the article and let us know what you think, or share your own experiences!  \n  \n",

I’ve been working on this project on-and-off for a while, and I thought I would see what [r/DE](https://www.reddit.com/r/DE/) thinks.\n\nThe basics of the pipeline are as follows, orchestrated with Airflow:\n\n1. Download and extract bill data from [Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/) bulk data page, unzip it in my local environment (Google Compute VM in prod) and concatenate into a few files for easier upload to GCS. Obviously not scalable for bigger data, but seems to work OK here\n2. Extract url of voting results listed in each bill record, download voting results from url, convert from xml to json and upload to GCS\n3. In parallel, extract member data from [Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/) API, concatenate, upload to GCS\n4. Create external tables with airflow operator then staging and dim/fact tables with dbt\n5. Finally, export aggregated views (gold layer if you will) to a schema that feeds a Streamlit app.\n\nA few observations / questions that came to mind:\n\n\\- To create an external table in BigQuery for each data type, I have to define a consistent schema for each type. This was somewhat of a trial-and-error process to understand how to organize the schema in a way that worked for all records. Not to mention instances when incoming data had a slightly different schema than the existing data. Is there a way that I could have improved this process?\n\n\\- In general, is my DAG too bloated? Would it be best practice to separate my different data sources (members, bills, votes) into different DAGs?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/153iiz683llf1.png?width=2158&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e735c54db6bf536fa52d7f8e4fa246feb62f7b\n\n\\- I probably over-engineered aspects of this project. For example, I’m not sure I need an IaC tool. I also could have likely skipped the external tables and gone straight to a staging table for each data type. The Streamlit app is definitely high latency, but seems to work OK once the data is loaded. Probably not the best for this use case, but I wanted to practice Streamlit because it’s applicable to my day job.\n\nThank you if you’ve made it this far. There are definitely lots of other minor things that I could ask about, but I’ve tried to keep it to the biggest point in this post. I appreciate any feedback!",

This approach works, but it’s error-prone — for example, manual updates or overlooked changes sometimes don’t update these columns, causing data to be missed in our loads.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many streaming CDC solutions (Debezium, Kafka Connect, AWS DMS) that consume binlogs, but they feel overkill for small teams and require substantial operational overhead.\n\nThis leads me to wonder: why isn’t there a **more lightweight, batch-oriented binlog reader and parser** that could be used for incremental processing? Are there any existing tools or libraries that support this use case that I might be missing?

This requires building pipelines with data that are heavily dependent on manual input and maintenance by team members in various operations platforms.

We struggle to get team members to consistently make manual updates in our operations platforms.\n\nMy question for you all is: \nHow do you get buy-in from team members who don’t use the data directly / are not directly impacted by inaccuracies in the data, to consistently and accurately maintain their data?\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

I’m confused about how to structure this properly. Right now I’m stuck between half-automated VBA hacks and trying to build something more robust in Python.\n\nQuestions:\nWhat’s the cleanest way to set up this pipeline when the “database” is basically just Excel files?\n\nHow would you handle the deduplication logic (cross-history + internal CCID duplicates) in a clean way?\n\nIs Python + Pandas the right approach here, or should I lean more into existing ETL tools?\n\nI’d really appreciate some guidance or examples on how to build this properly — I’m getting a bit lost in Excel/VBA land.\n\nThanks!\n",

        "author": "hzburki",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "> I plan to move all my business logic to a separate API service and call endpoints using the HTTPOperator. Lesson learned! Please focus on my concerns and alternate solutions. I would like to get more opinions.   \n\nI have created a pipeline using Airflow which will process social media profiles. I need to update their data and insert new content (videos/images) into our database.\n\nI will test it to see if it handles the desired load but it will cost money to host and pay the external data providers so I want to get a second opinion on my implementation.\n\nI have to run to run the pipeline periodically and process a lot of profiles;\n1. Daily: 171K profiles\n2. Two Weeks: 307K profiles\n3. One Month: 1M profiles\n4. Three Months: 239K profiles\n5. Six Months: 506K profiles\n6. Twelve Months: 400K profiles\n\nThese are the initial numbers. They will be increased gradually over the next year so I will have time and a team to work on scaling the pipeline. The daily profiles have to be completed the same day. The rest can take longer to complete. \n\nI have split the pipeline into 3 DAGs. I am using hooks/operators for S3, SQS and postgres. I am also using asyncio with aiohttp for storing multiple content on s3. \n\n## DAG 1 (Dispatch)\n- Runs on a fixed schedule\n- fetches data from database based on the provided filters.   \n- Splits data into individual rows, one row per creator using `.expand`. \n- Use dynamic task mapping with TriggerDagRunOperator to create a DAG to process each profile separately. \n- I also set the task_concurrency to limit parallel task executions. \n\n## DAG 2 (Process)\n- Triggered by DAG 1\n- Get params from the first DAG\n- Fetches the required data from external API\n- Formats response to match database columns + small calculations e.g. posting frequency, etc. \n- Store content on S3 + updates formatted response. \n- Stores messages (1 per profile) in SQS. \n\n## DAG 3 (Insert)\n- Polls SQS every 5 mins\n- Get multiple messages from SQS \n- Bulk insert into database\n- Delete multiple messages from SQS  \n\n## Concerns\nI feel like the implementation will work well apart from two things.\n\n1) In DAG 1 I am fetching all the data e.g. max 1 million ids plus a few extra fields and loading them into the python operator before its split into individual rows per creator. I am doubtful that this my cause memory issues because the amount of rows is large but the data size should not be more than a few MBs. \n\n2) In DAG 1 on tasks 2 and 3, splitting the data into separate processes for each profile will trigger 1 million DAG runs. I have set the concurrency limit to control the amount of parallel runs but I am unsure if Airflow can handle this. \n\nKeep in mind there is no heavy processing. All tasks are small, with the longest one taking less than 30 seconds to upload 90 videos + images on S3. All my code on Airflow and I plan to deploy to AWS ECS with auto-scaling. I have not figured out how to do that yet.  \n\n## Alternate Solutions\nAn alternative I can think of is to create a \"DAG 0\" before DAG 1, which fetches the data and uploads batches into SQS. The current DAG 1 will pull batches from SQS e.g. 1,000 profiles per batch and create dynamic tasks as already implemented. This way I should be able to control the number of dynamic DAG runs in Airflow. \n\nA second option is that I don't create dynamic DAG runs for each profile but a batch of 1,000 to 5,000 profiles. I don't think this is a good idea because;\n1) It will create a very long task if I have to loop through all profiles to process them.\n2) I will likely need to host it separately in a container.\n3) Right now, I can see which profiles fail, why, when and where in DAG 2.\n\nI would like to keep things as simple as possible. I also have to figure out how and where to host the pipeline and how much resources to provision to handle the daily profiles target but these are problems for another day.\n\nThank you for reading :D",

        "content": "Hi all, \n\n  \nFirst of all, i'm a beginner.\n\nCurrently, were using a low code tool for our transformations but planning to migrate to a SQL/python first solution. We're applying data vault although we sometimes abuse it as in that besides strict link, hub and sats, we throw bridge tables in the mix. One of the issues we currently see in our transformations is that links are dependent on keys/hashes of other objects (that's natural i would say). Most of the time, we fill the hash of the object in the same workflow as the corresponding id key column in the link table. Yet, this creates a soup of dependencies and doesn't feel that professional.\n\nThe main solution we're thinking off is to make use of a keychain. We would define all the keys of the objects on basis of the source tables (which we call layer 1 tables, i believe it would be called bronze right?).  and fill the keychain first before running any layer 2/silver transformations. This way, we would have a much clearer approach in handling keys without making it a jungle of dependencies. I was wondering what you guys do or what best practices are?\n\nThanks.",

Features like materialized view or aggregating mergetrees seems also super interesting to us.\n\nWe have made the decision to incluse CH into our infrastructure, knowing that it's gonna be a key part for BI mostly (metrics coming from sensors mostly, with quite a lot of functional logic with time windows or contexts and so on).\n\nThe question is: how do we host this?\nThere isnt a single chance I can convince my boss to use a managed service, so we will use resources from a cloud provider.\n\nWhat are you experiences with self-hosted CH? Would you recommend a replicated infrastructure with multiple containers based on docker-compose ? Do you think kubernetes is a good idea?\nAlso, if there are some downsides or drawbacks to clickhouse we should consider I am definitely up for some feedbacks on it!\n\n[Edit] our data volume is currently about 30GB/day, using Clickhouse it goes down to ~1GB/day\n\nThank you very much!",

We're talking days, not hours, for the sync to complete, which leaves our downstream dashboards and reports stale.\n\n**Our Current Setup:**\n\n* **Source:** HubSpot\n* **Destination:** Snowflake\n* **Integration Tool:** Airbyte\n* **Sync Mode:** Incremental Append + Deduplication\n* **Suspected Bottleneck:** We're almost certain this is due to the HubSpot API rate limits.\n\n**My Questions for You:**\n\n1. What tools or architectures are you using for this pipeline (Fivetran, Airbyte, Stitch, custom scripts, etc.)?\n2. How do you manage HubSpot schema changes without triggering a full, multi-day table resync?\n3. Are there any known workarounds for HubSpot's API limits, like using webhooks for certain events or exporting files to S3 first?\n4. Is there a better sync strategy we should consider?\n\nI'm open to any and all suggestions. Thanks in advance for your input!",

This consists of techs like kafka, snowpipe streaming for real time ingestion and also snowpipe/copy jobs for batch processing of files from AWS S3 and then Streams, Tasks, snowflake Dynamic tables for tramsformation. The snowflake account have multiple databases and in that multiple schemas exists but we only want to have the DR configuration done for critical schemas/tables and not full database.\n\nMajority of the component hosted on the AWS cloud infrastructure. However, as mentioned this has also spanned across components which are lying outside the Snowflake like e.g kafka, Airflow scheduler etc. But also within snowflake we have warehouses , roles, stages which are in the same account but are not bound to a schema or database. And how these different components would be in synch during a DR exercise making sure no dataloss/corruption or if any failure/pause in the halfway in the data pipeline? I am going through the below document. Feels little lost when going through all of these. Wanted some guidance on , how we should proceed with this?

If it is not possible to fetch the attachments, is there a workaround? \n\nFor context, in our newer pipelines we already use Gmail’s API directly to handle attachments, but my boss thinks it might be simpler to migrate the older Fivetran pipelines through Airbyte if possible.",

I've also been taking note of tools people mention here to know what I want to use during the project. SQL is a given, as is Python.

That means your Pinecone index lags behind—new events, chats, or documents aren’t searchable until the next sync. For live systems (support bots, background agents), this delay hurts.\n\nTo solve this I've developed a streaming pipeline that takes data directly from Kafka, generates embeddings on the fly, and upserts them into Pinecone continuously. With Kafka to pinecone template , you can plug in your Kafka topic and have Pinecone index updated with fresh data. \n\n- Agents and RAG apps respond with the latest context\u000b \n- Recommendations systems adapt instantly to new user activity\n\nCheck out how you can run the data pipeline with minimal configuration and would like to know your thoughts and feedback.

Thought I'd share what we learned for anyone considering this approach.\n\nWhy we chose it: No direct DB access required, no API exposure, felt like the safest route. Simple setup - automated nightly CSV exports to S3, vendor polls and ingests.\n\nThe reality:\n\n* File reliability issues - corrupted/incomplete transfers were more common than expected. Had to build proper validation and integrity checks.\n* Schema management nightmare - any data structure changes required vendor coordination to prevent breaking their scripts. Massively slowed our release cycles.\n* Processing delays - several hours between data ready and actually processed, depending on their polling frequency.\n\nTL;DR: Secure file upload is great for security/simplicity but budget significant time for monitoring, validation, and vendor communication overhead.\n\nAnyone else dealt with similar challenges?

I get extremely demotivated when all my coding is AI prompts, there's no thinking involved, and I just wonder, why I spent so much time studying in Uni, or learning any new thing when AI will do the job. I have to read complicated docs, to \"learn\" framework, but actual coding, after I'm familiar with framework, not to mess it up, they say, AI should do 50% of it. \n\nThey say, juniors who use AI with them, are gonna replace those who don't. Well, it's not much of job , if all you do is prompt AI, I feel like manual laborer already, just I sit and need to supervise on screen unhealthy amount.\n\nAI gets in my way. I hate it. I only need it for explanations and maybe suggestions. I'm fine using it for something new and really hard, beyond my ability level. \n\nBut outsourcing all CSS work to AI ? Well, leave some fun to me. But management says otherwise.  ",

I’d love to get advice from this community.\n\nHere’s what I’ve found so far (please correct me if I’m missing something):\n\nPostman → Probably the most popular. Great GUI, lots of tutorials.\n\nHoppscotch → A lightweight, open source alternative to Postman. Runs in the browser or self-hosted.\n\nBruno → Stores collections as plain text, easy to version control (great for teams).\n\nHurl → CLI-based, tests APIs using simple text files. Super clean for automation.\n\nYaak → Made by the original Insomnia founder. Sleek UI.\n\nSoapUI → Bit older but strong if you need SOAP and more complex protocols.\n\nApidog → Similar to Postman, but I noticed it has a neat offline mode and works well for designing + mocking APIs.\n\nThunder Client (VS Code extension) → Really handy if you don’t want to leave your editor.\n\n\nFor someone still learning programming, what would you recommend focusing on first?\nShould I start with a GUI tool like Postman/Bruno/Hoppscotch, or dive straight into CLI stuff like Curl/Hurl to build stronger fundamentals?\n\nWould love to hear what worked for you all when you were learning API testing.

        "author": "yughiro_destroyer",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi! I have been working as a web developer for two years and when I am looking at the codebases of the projects I am a part of I am unable to understand what is exactly going on. I simply believe that a lot of the code that is written today is unreadable but I am not sure if that's really the case or I am simply not skilled enough.  \n  \nI used to be a perfectionist and when I was working on my own projects it would take even 30 minutes or more to simply decide on naming a variable. Overthinking kept me away from creating and that's the primary reason for which I've wasted a lot of time. I tried to aim for perfection but such thing doesn't exist. I remember once I had the ocassion to talk with a popular car designer at Renault about sketching cars and getting the perfect drawing and he answered me with \"Only God can be perfect.\". Later now, I was able to quit this toxic and not productive mindset of \"aiming at perfection\".   \n  \nStill, that doesn't mean I don't have a sense for order and beauty (I think?). Yes, nothing can be perfect but there are worse or better ways of doing something. When it comes to code, I am a big fan or consistency. What do I mean by that? Be consistent in naming conventions, in programming paradigms and in the location of the created and used modules. I admire simplicity and I dislike complexity.\n\nFor example, one of the most recallable thing is that in the place where I work, when there is an request to update the CSS on a page, we overwrite the element rules. Instead of trying to locate and modify a class on a HTML tag they would write new rules using that tag's ID, would add style directly in HTML or use the !important rule specifier.\n\nWhen it comes to what is JS, code is split around everywhere, hard to trace or reason about. That's something I noticed studying other online smaller projects. I am studying game development on my own at home and when I am reading the source code of some indies... code is literally a weird combination betweeing polling and event driven. I respect both paradigms but combining them, especailly with no comments or no consistency, turns into a nightmare to track. I prefer those 10000 lines of ifs in GameMaker than this weird combination of callbacks and procedural.\n\nMore than anything, I admire code that is consistent and ordered. If a module is chaotic, then that chaos is the module's chaos and trapped in there. If the module has proper wiring between input, outputs and isn't tangled with the main application as a complete monolith, that specific part can be much more easily refactored or replaced in case of need (for later optimization or other stuff).\n\nAlso, tutorials. Everytime and then when I want to start learning a new library or framework or whatever, tutorials simply get into unnecessary specifics. For example, I want a 2 minute tutorial to teach me about creating an endpoint. But most tutorials start to delve inside unrelated stuff like ORMs or authentification. Yes, these are important, but right now we were talking about url endpoints, right? That's like learning the piano and out of nowhere \"yo, check out these guitar strings\" when trying to become a musician.\n\nI hope I didn't write too much BS but to end this post gracefully I will leave here my question (which is also present in the title) : Are some codebases really unredable or am I simply dumb? Is reading codebases a skill in itself? Then how do you become better at it? Has it ever occured to you to find a codebase where your first impression was \"that's pure art!\" ?  \nThanks for reading.",

My dad's a programmer and dealt with carpal tunnel in his 40s, so I'm trying to be proactive about this stuff.\n\n\n\nHere's what I've started doing that seems to help:\n\nTaking breaks: Set a timer for every 45 minutes, get up and stretch for 5 minutes. Actually doing this consistently has been harder than I expected but it makes a difference. This is necessary, the rest will pay off in the ling run guys. \n\nWrist stretches: Found some good ones on YouTube. The prayer stretch and wrist flexor stretches seem to help the most.\n\nBetter posture: Raised my monitor so I'm not hunching over. Best way to go about it is a standing desk but I don't have enough to invest in an automatic one (Magnus Pro looks so so good!) yet so I haven't gotten one yet. On the other hand, I am still working on keeping my shoulders relaxed, the anxiety I feel constantly keeps them clenched.\n\nSplit keyboard: This was probably the biggest change. Switched to a NocFree Lite about 4 months ago and honestly my wrists feel way more natural now. Takes some getting used to but the angle just feels right. NocFree Lite is just so light and easy to carry around. You'd think that the carrying part was annoying because of the 2 piece product but they provided a carrying bag with the board as well. \n\nProper mouse positioning: Moved my mouse closer and have been on a lookout for a vertical mouse. I've been checking out the Anker wireless vertical ergonomic mouse as well as the Logitech MX vertical, which one is better? Any other ergonomic mouse that I should check out?\n\nAnyone else dealing with this early in their programming journey? What's worked for you?

You’ve got a month, and it’s 50% of your grade. Good luck.” That’s basically been my experience.\n\nI’ve tried doing small projects, but I always get stuck in a cycle:\n- Start something (like Langton’s ant in JS + HTML).\n- Hit a wall (e.g., “how do I make a grid?”).\n- Bang head on it for an hour, then ask AI.\n -Repeat until I have something that “works,” but I don’t feel like I actually learned much.\n- Try to extend it (e.g., Game of Life), realize I don’t understand enough, and give up.\n\nA month later, I’ve forgotten everything anyway.\n\nI’ve gone through this same cycle with Godot, React, etc. — learn a little, get stuck or bored, forget it.\n\nNow, I’ve got a month before uni starts again, and this year I’ll be working on a big, team-based project. My last team project ended with me being kicked out because the others were way ahead (lifelong coders, or just had way more time). I really don’t want that to happen again.\n\nTL;DR: I have one month to get vaguely comfortable coding in some language so I don’t drag down a team project.

        "content": "I'm not sure if I'm the only person this applies to, but it's certainly very weird for me. For context, I am a sophomore, and in my two math classes Honors Algebra 2 and Honors Geometry, the concepts in there are not exactly impossible to understand, but a bit more difficult to grasp. However, when I learn mathematics for programming, it's much easier compared to math inside school. For more context, I am an ML Engineer, and I've learned much harder topics such as matrices, partial derivatives, derivatives, vectors, and overall just a good amount of calculus and linear algebra for programming. Although it's obvious that I'm not going into incredible depth with those topics, and it's only a basic understanding for what I need, I have created an entire AI from scratch before, and I'm creating another one with a shitty Scratch ripoff called MIT App Inventor, and for any AI nerds out there, that is not an easy task. You must be proficient in your understanding of programming & math, so how the hell can I do that but I can't learn what a domain and range is??\n\nI'm not exactly sure why this happens to me, but it certainly is weird. I should also mention that I learn much better when watching YouTube videos on math compared to learning math in school, so maybe it's just the way I learn. I have an Honors Algebra 2 test on domain and range and a bunch of other things tomorrow such as like increasing intervals and stuff like that, so I'm going to try and figure out a way that I can implement those concepts into programming somehow. If anyone wants an update, I'll post it here.\n\n  \nEdit: I tried implementing programming into my studying, but by the time I did I had already understood everything so there was no need (I'm not sure that makes sense, but when studying how to implement it into code I just eventually learned it so there was no need to..? It's hard to explain.) I was also learning on little sleep & food for the past few weeks or so, so that's probably another factor that should've been mentioned before. My test got pushed back to Tuesday due to people not having their notes filled out, so I guess I'll have to wait until then to see how I do.",

I’ve learned all the python syntax, but for each project in the course I do,  it all seems to be an excercise in reading library documentation. Instead of feeling more confident in myself as a python dev, I am just constantly looking up libraries and how to use them, most of which I will not remember the exact syntax for, only that they exist. Due to this I feel like I am not getting better at python, only reading and essentially copy and pasting over solutions from the docs. From a c++ perspective I built everything myself, yet in python I know absolutely nothing about how many of these libraries work under the hood. I find myself questioning the use of these projects for learning if I will just forget everything later due to the libraries being endless, it’s not like syntax where I can lock it down and improve. I feel relatively incompetent here, like I couldn’t do anything in python without an internet connection. Has anyone else felt this way? ",

Instead of the usual abstract exercises, I’m creating *realistic bug-fixing scenarios* inspired by problems you might face in actual projects.\n\nEvery week I’ll be sharing a new “bug to fix” in the form of a Colab notebook (for now), so people can practice, learn, and reinforce concepts while thinking like engineers solving real-world issues.\n\nThis very first one is designed for beginners who are just starting out 👶, but the idea is to build a series with different levels: *intern, junior, and semi-senior*. That way, people can grow step by step and tackle challenges that fit their journey.\n\nFor now, all exercises will be in Python 🐍, but I believe they could be just as valuable as a starting point for people who later want to work with other technologies too.  \n  \nPlease send me a private message and I will share the challenge with you.\n\nI’d love to hear your feedback 🙏—does this approach feel useful, fun, or motivating to you? Any suggestions to improve it are more than welcome!\n\nThanks a lot for taking a look 💙",

I’m using MySQL for this because I want to get better with it for interviews and projects. I know i can use other tools to clean the messy data but i want to do it using sql to get some hands on experience wigh it\n\nThe trouble is, I have CSV files that contain a bunch of empty strings. MySQL won’t let me import those directly when my columns are typed as INT, DATE, etc. So I thought of two ways but both feel kinda inefficient:\n\n1. Create the table with all columns as `VARCHAR(50) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4`, import the raw data, then *later* clean the data by replacing empty strings with NULL or proper values, and finally convert each column to the right data type.\n\n2. Same as above but instead of replacing empty strings with proper values right away, I replace all empty strings with NULLs first, then work on cleaning/converting.\n\nI’m stuck because both approaches feel like extra work — importing everything as text then cleaning and converting feels like a hassle, especially since I’m still learning.\n\nI’m also wondering if maybe I should just switch to MSSQL since I heard it’s more flexible with empty strings on import, but I really want to stick with MySQL for now.\n\nSo, any tips or best practices for importing messy CSV data with empty fields into MySQL? Am I missing a better way? How do you pros handle these kinds of data issues in real-world projects? Also, if you were me, would you stick to MySQL or try MSSQL instead?",

        "content": "I am writing an LSP in Rust. This is the first time I have had a project that I felt needed more than just basic error handling. By that, I mean I sent a get request. Handle the possible error case at the call site. \n\nWith this project, I have several kinds of errors, and some of these kinds of errors require a specific response, as defined by the Microsoft spec.\n\nI'm using the \"?\" and a Result to push errors up the call stack, and right now, most of them just crash the program. This choice was deliberate. I didn't know how I wanted to handle this yet, and for the purpose of development, having the server crash is better for me because I know when and where I have a problem. I dont have to worry about noticing it in my log file or stderr.\n\nI've found the first point where I want to start to handle errors. The client sends messages to the server. I read, deserialize, and parse this message and produce an enum that tells the server what the client wants. Right now, I am reading the bytes out of stdin. I handle io errors here. I have two other functions that handle deserialization using serde to convert the bytes to concrete types and then read the method out of the concete type and match it to a corrisponding enum that the server can do things with.\n\nThis is where I'm hoping for feedback. \n\nWhen would you want to see the three kinds of errors I can expect in this process to be handled? The resulting enum for this process includes an error variant with the option to include the specification defined response error code for the LSP.\n\nShould I push all the errors up from the reader and deserialization process so that I can handle everything at one focal point?\n\nWould it be better to keep the kinds of errors handled at different points? So, reader errors get handled at one spot. Deserialize errors at another point. Method parsing errors at another point? Is there another approach I've not considered? \n\nWhat does a good error handling strategy look like to experienced programmers, and what advice can you offer to ensure verbose error handling for my project?\n\nThanks for your time.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I’ve been working with Angular and React, and I noticed a big difference in how they handle binding values in templates.\n\n* In Angular:\n   * `{{ }}` is only for string interpolation (text nodes).\n   * `[prop]` is required for property binding (booleans, numbers, objects).\n* In React:\n   * `{ }` works everywhere. You can pass strings, booleans, numbers, functions, etc. directly in JSX, and it just works.\n\nThis makes me wonder: isn’t React’s approach obviously more advantageous? With `{ }`, you don’t need to remember different syntaxes, it feels like “property binding that always works”.\n\nSo my question is: **why didn’t Angular just make** `{{}}` **work the same way?** Is there some hidden benefit in Angular’s stricter separation (interpolation vs property binding), or is it just a design philosophy thing?\n\nI would be very thankful to hear from you, especially from people who’ve used both frameworks.",

The course often tells me to “just build an assembler/VM/compiler using a high-level language and their APIs,” but that feels like cheating.\n\nI want to see how each layer is actually *implemented from first principles* and how it executes on bare hardware. For example, how does the first assembler itself run? How was a text processing program created from bare hardware, called assembler? Instead, the book says, “Here’s an assembler, just write it in Java/Python using our API”. The course leans on abstraction barriers and assumes you’re okay using a modern host computer as scaffolding.\n\nMy frustration is that I don’t just want to *use* an API to get the point, I want to see the mechanics of bootstrapping everything from the ground up, without skipping levels.

Very similar to Advent of Code, but definitely more frequent than yearly.\n\nI looked at the [FAQ](https://old.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq), but the only subreddit it had was to /r/dailyprogrammer, which hasn't received a new post in over 2 years.\n\nSo are there any subreddits that do provide this?\n\nI tried to [create something myself](https://old.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1c9a9kj/how_do_you_feel_about_a_monthly_java_project_for/) for /r/java, but it was (rightfully) [removed for being off-topic](https://old.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1c9a9kj/how_do_you_feel_about_a_monthly_java_project_for/l0ke4py/).\n\nAnd I specifically want a subreddit because the opportunity to learn here on reddit is immense. For example, the Advent of Code posts were some of the best education I got when learning how to improve as a programmer. Comparing my answer to other answers gave me insight into programming that I probably would not have otherwise gotten. I want a subreddit dedicated to that, as opposed to waiting every year for Advent of Code.",

I want to expand my skills and potentially shift my career toward AI/ML while still leveraging my Flutter experience. I’ve drafted a learning path using Udemy courses and I’d love feedback from anyone who’s done something similar.\n\n**My proposed roadmap (rough timeline \\~7–8 months):**\n\n**Phase 1 – Backend & Cloud (Month 1–2)**\n\n* *The Complete Node.js Developer Course* → Build backend APIs\n* *PostgreSQL for Everybody* → SQL & database design\n* *Docker & Kubernetes* → Deploy scalable apps\n* *AWS Cloud Practitioner (Optional)* → Cloud fundamentals **Goal:** Deploy a simple backend and connect it to a Flutter app\n\n**Phase 2 – Python & ML Fundamentals (Month 3–5)**\n\n* *100 Days of Code: Python* → Python mastery\n* *Machine Learning A–Z* → Core ML algorithms\n* *Deep Learning A–Z* → Neural networks & TensorFlow **Goal:** Train ML models and serve predictions\n\n**Phase 3 – Reinforcement Learning (Month 6–7)**\n\n* *Deep Reinforcement Learning 2.0* → Build game-playing agents\n* *Artificial Intelligence A–Z* → Practical AI projects **Goal:** Create small RL projects, like “AI plays Tic-Tac-Toe/Pokémon-style”\n\n**Phase 4 – Integrated Projects (Month 8+)**\n\n* Full-stack AI apps combining Flutter frontend, backend APIs, and AI/ML models\n* Example projects: AI Tic-Tac-Toe, Finance Predictor App, Pokémon Battle Bot Dashboard\n\n**My questions for the community:**\n\n1. Does this roadmap make sense for someone trying to go from Flutter → Full-Stack → AI/ML?\n2. Are there courses I should replace or add to make it more effective?\n3. Any advice on balancing full-stack and ML learning simultaneously?\n4. Are there pitfalls I should be aware of for this type of hybrid career path?\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance — I’m excited to build both skills and portfolio projects.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This subreddit has a huge FAANG obsession, and it completely distorts the perception of software engineering. Every other post seems to be about insane comp packages, grueling interviews, layoffs, or burnout stories. But if you look at the actual data, the reality for most developers is completely different.\n\n[Resume.io (2025)](https://resume.io/blog/which-professions-are-the-happiest-at-work) found that 87 percent of software developers reported being “very happy” in their jobs, the highest of any profession surveyed. \n\n[Career.io (2024)](https://career.io/career-advice/careers-that-make-americans-happiest) analyzed nearly 756,000 job ratings and found software developers among the most satisfied six figure earners, with a median salary around 130K. \n\n[Market.biz (2025)](https://market.biz/job-satisfaction-statistics/#job-satisfaction-statistics-in-different-industries) reported that 74 percent of tech professionals worldwide are satisfied with their jobs. \n\nSo why does this subreddit feel so negative compared to those numbers? Because the voices dominating here are FAANG engineers or startup employees, and their experiences are extreme. Life inside FAANG is often miserable. Long hours, constant pressure to ship, endless internal politics, and the looming threat of layoffs make it feel like a treadmill you can never step off. Software is the company’s entire product, so everything you do is under constant scrutiny and pressure. Burnout is common, and that is exactly what this sub amplifies.\n\nMeanwhile, the average developer lives a completely different life, and that is what drives the high happiness statistics. Most are not in San Francisco or New York. They live in mid sized cities or suburbs where their salary goes much further. They are not chasing the next billion dollar app. They work at hospitals, insurance companies, banks, logistics firms, or government agencies. The work is steady, respected, and meaningful, even if it never makes headlines.\n\nThey make 100K to 130K, comfortably above the national median. Their hours are closer to forty a week. They get PTO. Their managers are competent but not tyrannical. And because software is a support function rather than the company’s core product, the pressure to grind nonstop is low. That is why surveys consistently show high satisfaction.\n\nThe quiet majority of developers who live this life rarely post here. Nobody makes a thread to say “My job is stable, I like my team, I worked normal hours, and I had a great weekend hiking.” The loud minority who post are often FAANG engineers or startup refugees talking about their misery. That is why this subreddit can make software engineering seem miserable, even though for most people it is not.\n\nThe truth is that chasing FAANG is often what ruins people’s perception of software engineering. It is the exception, not the rule. The average developer is happy, balanced, and living a peaceful, stable, and well-compensated life. Even in 2024 and 2025, software engineering remains one of the happiest and most rewarding professions you can choose, as long as you understand that most developers do not live the FAANG nightmare that dominates this subreddit.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Novel warning, but it's a good one IMO, tldr at the bottom\n\nThis is probably a common scam, but it was new to me so I figured I'd post it here in the off chance it helps someone avoid unwittingly destroying their entire company.\n\nFor some time we had been getting flooded with nearly identically formatted resumes that were all very low quality. They were loaded with random keywords from our postings to try to maximize automated ranking but used very poor grammar or just nonsense word soup.\n\nThey were all PDFs and all of them had similar metadata that was unique to them so I just wrote a script for our recruiters to auto-reject all of them.\n\nWe got tons of them for every pure-remote posting, never in-office, or even hybrid.\n\nCuriosity got the better of me so I tried to schedule a tech screen with a few of them. Most ghosted, but I was able to actually get on a call with one.\n\n* The name was very English, first and last.\n* Age was late 20's which was a bit young given the timeline shown in the work history and education, but not impossible. It put them finishing their BS right at 21.\n* Location was listed as Austin, Texas and indicated that they were legal to work in the US without visa endorsement.\n* They listed a BS in Game Programming from Full Sail University (private, for-profit, online). I've had limited but mixed experience with their grads. Not an auto-reject school, but it's not going to help your resume really.\n* They had some work history with several short-term contracts with random non-us based small game studios and one 2-year stint with a well-known, but long defunct American studio. The timeline was a a bit dense with their first 2 contract gigs overlapping with their last year of college.\n\nUnfortunately for this person, the games industry is fairly small and I have close friends who were at the studio they listed at the time they reported having worked there. One of my friends would have been the director of the team this person reported having been a junior engineer on. My friend confirmed without question that this person was never at that studio and was never on his team.\n\nOnce I got on the call (zoom), it was clear the the person was not a native English speaker. Which isn't a problem, they were conversational, just incongruitous with the name. The age also seemed unlikely; this person was probably over 40, though I've been more off on age guesses before. I'm familiar with Austin so I asked about the city a bit. It was clear that the person had never been there, let alone lived there.\n\nI poked at their technical skills and they actually seemed like they had some programming knowledge, but nothing close to what their experience and education would suggest. They used jargon more in-line with a very junior web developer than a mid-level game engineer. C++ was very weak, no knowledge of basic game design principles, and they couldn't speak at all to basic game development team structure or workflows.\n\nI was ready to get to the truth so I asked where they were calling from, making up some bullshit their IP address looking unusual (lie, zoom doesn't expose that). They said they were visiting family in Delhi but would be back in the US before the start date. I asked to confirm their legality to work in the US and they confirmed what was in their application and added that they were a natural born American citizen.\n\nI asked about their experience at the US-based game studio. I asked some specifics about their internal processes that you would only know if you were actually working there as an engineer (they had an unusual source-control workflow). Candidate had no clue and made up some bullshit. I asked about their responsibilities on the team and who they reported to; more bullshit.\n\nTime to take the mask off.\n\nI told them I know they never worked at that studio. I told them I know they've never been to Austin. And I asked directly: what's your goal here? They tried to redirect, and doubled down on the bullshit, clearly not understanding that the scam was over. So I asked about the name on the application: Is that a real person? Did you steal their identity? Are they in on it like some sort of employment mule? They immediately dropped from the call.\n\nAfter the call, I hit up our legal department and asked them to see if the name on the application could be identified as a real person (possibly in Austin). Turns out the name was just uncommon enough and we had just enough PII that it did match a likely real person in Austin. Legal notified the Austin PD about the probable identity theft (or possibly an accomplice to fraud) and that was the last I heard about it.\n\nMy theory is that the scammers get enough info about an American to secure a remote job with that identity (really they just need a name, DoB, and SSN). They rely on companies not verifying their education and employment history (which they make difficult using small and defunct companies). Then they spam every possible remote job listing hoping to overwhelm their recruiting pipeline and sneak someone through. I imagine they would do just enough to not get immediately fired and collect a paycheck while exfiltrating as much source code, data, and other assets of value as possible once they have access. I would be surprised if they didn't also try to plant ransomware or other malware to company systems or worse, customers.\n\nThis was a few months ago, and I'm no longer at that company, but their current director has told me that the resume script is still working and hitting about a hundred resumes per posting, still only for remote roles.\n\nIf you have this issue, look at the PDF metadata and it should be pretty obvious what pattern I'm talking about. My script was very simple using PyMuPDF to read metadata to identify and filter them.\n\ntldr: Got lots of similar, sketchy resumes for remote postings only. I investigated and actually spoke to one of them. It was a scam.",

I can absolutely tell when a recruiter is using genai on the resume filtering and screening questions. Non-AI recruiters don’t send robotic, copy-paste rejections. They typo, they ask human questions and will clarify them. If you don’t understand what you’re filtering for, it’s easy to catch after some basic follow-up. I have had 5 recruiters clearly use AI, and I flagged each one to peers and mentors as a red flag company and they were all no longer considered.\n\nIt’s important to understand that the point of the resume review and screening interviews is to assess potential and alignment, not to ensure someone has perfect buzzwords on a resume or that they have flawless phrasing in their behavioral writeups.",

        "content": "I see a lot of posts here from people struggling with imposter syndrome, trying to learn \"everything,\" and burning themselves out. I want to share what I learned over 10+ years that could save you from making the same mistakes I did.\n\nThe Reality Check:\n\nWhen I started, I thought being a good developer meant:\n\n\\- Memorising every framework and language\n\n\\- Writing perfect code from day one\n\n\\- Working insane hours to \"prove myself\"\n\n\\- Never admitting I didn't know something\n\nAll of this was wrong and held me back for years.\n\nWhat Actually Matters:\n\nFor Job Applications:\n\nYou don't need to meet 100% of job requirements. I got interviews, meeting 60-70% of the requirements. Companies hire for potential and problem-solving ability, not just current skills.\n\nFor Learning:\n\nStop trying to learn everything. Focus on core concepts (data structures, algorithms, design patterns) and learn specific technologies as you need them. The best skill is learning how to learn quickly.\n\nFor Career Growth:\n\nYou'll never feel \"ready\" for the next level. I spent 2 years over-preparing for senior roles I was already qualified for. Apply anyway, volunteer for challenging projects anyway, give that tech talk anyway.\n\nFor Productivity:\n\nWorking 45 focused hours produces better results than 70 exhausted hours. Burnout isn't a badge of honour, it's a career killer. Take breaks, have hobbies, maintain relationships outside tech.\n\nFor Code Quality:\n\nNobody cares about your clever algorithms. They care about solutions that work and code that's maintainable. Write for the human who will read your code at 2 AM during an outage.\n\nI've written a comprehensive blog post with detailed examples and actionable advice for each of these points: [https://medium.com/@pcodesdev/10-years-of-programming-hard-earned-coding-lessons-to-save-you-a-decade-of-mistakes-d63fd848e62e?sk=5bad34c41e6426a28387e89f4e1f5412](https://medium.com/@pcodesdev/10-years-of-programming-hard-earned-coding-lessons-to-save-you-a-decade-of-mistakes-d63fd848e62e?sk=5bad34c41e6426a28387e89f4e1f5412)\n\nCurrent developers: What do you wish you'd known earlier?\n\nJob seekers: Which of these resonates most with your current struggles?",

I know the job market is ultra-competitive right now but it's still my responsibility to work with what I have, and I haven't been.\n\nI realized during the five years I've studied Computer Science that even though I love video-games and thought robotics was alright (I did robotics programming in highschool & during my senior project, mentored by AmazonRobotics), I have no confidence in programming, and frankly, problem-solving in general. Everything is so reliant on connecting/social engineering now that my anti-social ass hasn't been doing. My parents have gotten people from my church and extended family, to give advice to me and frankly I've mostly been ignoring them when they repeat the same stuff I've been hearing for a while now. I apply to X position a family/family friend tells me to apply to, I get rejected/ghosted, repeat ad-nauseam until I stopped applying months down the line out of frustration, lying to them saying \"yeah I applied to plenty of places\". Confidence is at an all-time low.\n\nToday my mom yells at me on how much I've been freeloading and threatens to kick me out, and I couldn't talk back at her because I know she's right.  \n  \n**For the short-term,** I have $2,700 in my bank account, pretty much nothing to live on my own for. I hate being around my family but really want a remote position to show to my parents ASAP, so I don't get the boot. At this point I don't care what field it is, it doesn't have to be CS/programming--I really want to get a remote job in SOMETHING I can tolerate, in the next couple weeks or so while I try and gather my bearings for my future, or else I am likely getting kicked out. Preferably something that doesn't get too in the way of me studying for certs.\n\n**For the long-term,** If it helps, again, I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science, a AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, and am currently studying for the CompTIA A+ certification because I figured maybe I can try the IT space if I hate programming so much (already paid for a voucher, planning to take the exam in \\~2 weeks). Unfortunately had no real work experience/internships in the Comp. Sci. field as I was too busy just trying not to drop out; took me 5 years to graduate. I've worked Doordash for a couple months using the family car, until my parents forbade me from doing so (for asinine reasons but it's their car so I can't talk back). I thought I was passionate in programming, I'm not. I have pretty much no passion in anything except games and anime, both industries sound awful to actually work in. Last week I started brainstorming a Unity game since I randomly thought it would be nice to work on something, anything, and put it on GitHub. \n\n**I'm well-aware that my story is not rare. Again, this is my fault. I've been too passive, and arrogant. But today I might as well ask for advice, both for the short and long-term. Thank you.** ",

The applicants ranged from those with a couple of years of experience to developers with over 10 years in the UK tech industry.\n\nThis really highlights how competitive the tech job market has become. It feels like there’s a growing imbalance, far more developers than available positions. I don't recall this situation in the old hires. With new graduates entering the field each year, it’s unlikely the situation will improve anytime soon.\n\nIf you're job hunting, my best advice is to find a way to stand out. Do something that helps your application rise above the noise, because often the hardest part is simply getting your CV seen by a recruiter in a sea of hundreds.\n\n**Update** : I've previously received some questions about the role and would like to clarify a few things. I will not be able answer all questions but I would like answer some of them here;\n\n\\- The role is not a remote job, it's a hybrid role based in London Office.\n\n\\- We required right to work in the UK and no sponsorships.\n\n\\- The majority of applicants are based in UK with some exceptions of South Asian (India, Pakistan etc.), African (Nigeria, South Africa etc.) and North American (Canada and US) applicants in 10s.\n\n\\- We posted on multiple platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn and company website.\n\n\\- The whole process is overwhelming as human review will take quite some time to process all the applicants unless we switch to AI based CV reading tools.\n\n\\- The number of applicants surpassed a few hundred in the first few hours, and 1,000+ by the end of the first day of the job posting.\n\n\\- The salary is inline with average junior salaries in the UK which is between £30k to £40k.\n\n\\- There are a lot of uk based mid and senior engineers who apply, which shows stagnant job market which once only affected juniors, now clearly started to hit mid and senior levels too.\n\n\\- Additionally this is my burner/junk account, not my main account. I don't want to risk my job by making myself and my company identifiable, which could easily happen if I posted from my main account. I made sure, obviously, not to be the person who shares the company’s internal recruitment information on the internet.\n\n\\- Also I want to clarify that I craft and rephrase my paragraphs using ChatGPT and Grammarly, which is quite standard practice in this day and age.\n\n\\- If you have more questions feel free to reach me out via chat, I can't promise a response to all messages, but I will do my best. Thanks",

What I see instead is this sense of, “I’m better than you because you don’t know X, and I do”. It’s like people are just waiting, frothing at the mouth for their chance to elevate themselves over another person, instead of just helping that person learn, or at the very least not shaming and degrading them for not knowing something. \n\nThe reality is that many things are easily teachable and once you get it, you get it. Most people can learn if the information is presented to them in the right way. So why isn’t that approach adopted in today’s working world, to build happier, healthier teams? What is with all the elitism?  \n\nDon’t these people realize that the second someone else knows more than they do, that person is then considered “better” by the rules of this stupid game? And what’s the solution there - to keep rabidly trying to outdo everyone around you? It’s just not viable. ",

        "author": "cs_____question1031",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I had a task to make a button component in a shared library as part of a larger initiative. However, in this initiative, there was a ticket which was for making “design tokens”. I read through it, and it detailed we’d have design tokens for broad things like “primary color” and “accent color”. However, it also stated that individual components would have their own design tokens, so if it was a button, it might have “button primary color”. I brought this up to my manager, that I’m not sure if I should be working on the button because it seems dependent on this other ticket. I think there was a whole lot of misunderstandings, but she kinda seemed to get pretty hostile about it\n\nI guess I noticed that I really wasn’t getting anywhere with this conversation and everything I said seemed to make her even more angry. She threatened to put me on PIP at least once during this conversation, which I felt was unmerited, so I disengaged entirely and went to my previous manager. My previous manager is super chill so I was hoping we could just resolve it somehow. She set up a meeting with my skip. I just simply told him the exact situation, kinda in an emotionless, anodyne way. He seemed very receptive to it, surprisingly. He brought up that my manager had negative feedback about me “not following processes”, which we had a long conversation about, and he seemed much more “on my side” than I thought he would be. From my manager’s feedback, you’d think I’m doing everything wrong — but the skip was like “yeah it’s a new thing everyone is adjusting to. You’re fine”. I think this did get my manager in trouble, though\n\nI never did get an answer on the design tokens thing, but I was told to start work on the button. At first I made the button following the design tokens as the document stated, but I was told to remove this. No problem, AI was quickly able to resolve that. But then she started nitpicking pretty much every, insignificant detail. Mind you, this is really just a `<button>` with some tailwind classes applied, with 100% unit test coverage. Specifically, she goes after the storybook (which is just a preview for the components), and constantly changes her mind there. “It should be like this” then I’ll submit it and she’ll be like “no I changed my mind make it like this”. They’re not things I would know as a developer, they’re just subjective preferences like “I want this story to be called (whatever) instead”. I find it all kinda odd, cause there are controls on storybook that let you change the preview. You can configure it to show whatever button you want using those\n\nI also have another ongoing PR for another component. Same thing here, she nitpicks it to death, especially the storybook. It feels like she always has a new thing to add or remove, which at some point just feels entirely unproductive, so I wonder why she’s doing it as my manager if it would reflect poorly on her. Like, even I think this is a waste of everyone’s time at this point, so I get suspicious\n\nThen going back to the other one that originally used design tokens, she insists that I remove a css file that we would use for the design tokens in the future. This is a bit more complex than you’d think because it requires changing the build around and the exports in the package.json and I’m _pretty sure_ it might break tailwind when used in an app. I told her that I don’t think this is a good idea cause we’ll just have to revert it in the future, but she absolutely insists that we must do this. I actually feel kinda uncomfortable with it. I’m essentially making extra work for future me, for no gain and a potential bug\n\nAll this time I notice that she said I would have to ship this button this week _and_ replace all instances of the button in 3 apps. I still think she’s mad about the meeting with the skip manager we had. I really don’t wanna go to him again, but I’m concerned that she’s just trying to justify letting me go by making it impossible for me to get my work done. What should I do?",

I kinda fell in love with this discipline since it blended technical expertise with human factors. It also seemed to be of very practical application as the projects always ended in some kind of testable prototype.\n\nHowever, I noticed it's probably the CS domain with fewer jobs, and the ones which exist, separate the \"computer\" skills from the \"human\" skills into different roles, killing what makes this specialization interesting in the first place. I also noticed it's not considered an attractive discipline amongst my CS peers.\n\nIn your opinion, what makes HCI feel so 'singled out', as a CS field? And why does it fail to get market traction?",

I've bounced between different areas working at 3 game studios/startups doing mobile games with Unity/C#, then tried pivoting to a data engineering startup working with Rust and Apache DataFusion. Got laid off in January after losing my mother and not being able to focus at work.\n\nI genuinely don't know what I want anymore. I love making games but every studio I've worked at has been a mess with terrible management, companies folding, and barely livable pay. I thought pivoting to traditional software engineering would be smarter for stability and money, but now I'm wondering if I've just made myself unemployable by having such a scattered background.\n\nI've applied to about 30 jobs in the last month across Rust, fullstack, and some gamedev positions, but all I got was crickets, except one rejection email. I'm running low on savings and getting desperate. Honestly, I don't even know if I'm looking for jobs the right way or if I'm missing something obvious about the process. Edit: I use LinkedIn and Glassdoor, I suck at socializing and barely have a network. Please help\n\nI keep going in circles trying to figure out whether I should just give up on gamedev entirely and focus on traditional SWE roles. I'm honestly just confused about everything right now and could use some outside perspective. Thanks in advance\n\n[Here's my god-awful resume](https://pastebin.com/kQXZfhiH) in case it helps (it's a mess)",

        "content": "I've read a lot of different questions and suggestions on things early developers might want to consider but this is one I actually haven't heard as much and something I wish I had started doing day 1 of my career.\n\nWhen I started out my focus was on trying to learn software development. I'd take a bit of time each week to dig into the technologies I was using at work to try and find non-functional areas we could improve in as I was grinding out functional stuff. over time this built up to an okay understanding of the SDLC overall.\n\nthere are plenty of areas I'm still not very strong, but at this point I have enough experience with enough different things that its relatively uncommon i encounter problems totally out of band from what I've seen before, and have a fairly decent understanding of many of the popular technologies used today across a wide span of problems. \n\nIve worked in a lot of different domains over my career. ive generally left most of the parsing of those domains to domain experts. sure, I'd pick up things here or there, enough exposure to particular verticals will do that, but I generally focused my time and energy on developing my tech knowledge, as it is more portable between jobs than domain specific stuff.\n\nthat said, I can now see the limits of this approach. I've been working in the same shop now for four years and I wish I had spent a little bit of time each week better learning the domain I am working in from first principles. I dont feel like I am lacking in technical ability. I have enough technical tools at my disposal. I feel I am lacking in domain specific insight, and so are the others surrounding me.\n\n If i had been studying my current domain a little bit more here and there over the past 4 years, I suspect I wouldn't feel this way. I suspect I would be able to crack some of the tough nut problems we've been dealing with sensibly.\n\nlooking back, there were plenty of times in past roles where I wasnt able to see the forest for the trees as a result of a little too much domain blindness & outsourcing of that knowledge to others who perhaps didn't know the domain all that well either.\n\nanyways, the advice I wish I had gotten was to carve out a bit of time for myself to learn the domain I was working in outside of the context of tech and programming. SWE skills are important, and most of the time we can learn the bits and pieces of a domain we need at the time, but some insights are locked behind both a general understanding of the tech and the domain.",

        "content": "Hi Reddit, I need some outside perspective on a situation at my remote project that's making me extremely uncomfortable.\n\nI'm 16 and working on a tech/coding project with people from all over the world. One of my collaborators is a much older man (I think 40s) from another country(japan).\n\nHow it started:  \n  \nInitially, everything was great and super professional. We communicated on Discord. He would compliment my work, like \"Good job on that template,\" which felt nice and motivating. He was very polite about scheduling meetings across our different time zones.\n\n**When things started to feel weird:**  \nAfter a few days, he learned my age during a call. After that, the dynamic slowly started to change.\n\n1. He suggested we move our conversation from the public Discord to WhatsApp and shared his personal number.\n2. His compliments started shifting from my work to me as a person.\n3. He found out I was interested in some media from his country (like anime/manga) and offered to teach me his language one-on-one.\n4. He started talking about me potentially working in his country in the future and asked if I was interested.\n\n**The part that is freaking me out now:**  \nLast night, the conversation escalated quickly. I asked for his LinkedIn to learn more about his professional background. He sent it, then immediately followed up by saying if I ever came to his country, he would \"show me around.\"\n\nThen he sent these messages back-to-back:  \n\"You are such a kind person.\"  \n\"You are a genius.\"  \n\"I'm serious.\"\n\nThis is where my internal alarms went off like crazy. It felt like a switch flipped from \"polite colleague\" to something intense and personal. It feels like he's trying to build some kind of deep emotional bond, and the \"I'm serious\" part felt like he was pressuring me to accept the compliments.\n\n**My question for you:**  \nAm I overreacting? Is this just a case of \"super politeness\" from a different culture, or is this classic grooming/love-bombing behavior? My gut is screaming that this is wrong, but my logical brain keeps trying to find excuses like \"maybe he's just being nice.\"\n\nWhat do you think is happening here, and more importantly, what is the safest and most professional way to handle this and create distance?\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm 16, my much older male colleague moved our chat to WhatsApp, and his praise has escalated to \"you're a genius, I'm serious\" after inviting me to visit him in his country. I feel creeped out and don't know if I'm misreading politeness or if this is predatory. Need advice.",

But now after 2 months on the new team, I am being told, my velocity is too slow, I need too much help, im stuck on simplistic things, etc. and because of that, they are now placing me on a PIP. I AM and STILL am not fully finished with their awful “TRAINING” for the new team, which is no help.\n\nOn my other team I did great. I delivered several projects and a huge rework for our MAIN web app.\n\nI also had a separate meeting about my PIP where I express my concerns. My boss explained to me she MOVED me onto this team because it’s a dumpster fire. She told me “they don’t know write and deliver code, there needs to be guidance for the QA”. Etc. ALSO these people when they write commits write the most bare minimum simple messages. What I am trying to get at is I was transferred to a UNSTRUCTURED AWFUL SPAGHETTI CODE REPO.\n\nMy boss said oh you can do this, don’t worry. We need to see growth here, velocity increase here, and make sure you do all the trainings etc… but there is no growth at this company. No promotions. No motivation.\n\nSo what are my options? First, is this PIP even allowed after a transfer so short?\n\nSecondly I feel im being mistreated, is there a path I can go towards?\n\nThirdly I’d even go as far as taking SHORT TERM DISABILITY and riding on their money.

While it's always been a grind with the nonstop chats/calls/tickets, I legitimately enjoyed it at first for the first two years or so. My first company was awesome. They are one of the best web hosts to work for. I was a level 2 tech and a top performer, easily knocking out 80+ chats a day. My manager would constantly tell me how good of a job I was doing. Despite that, I struggled to afford living in the city the company was based in. I eventually asked for a raise and was offered a one thousand dollar per YEAR raise. It wasn't sustainable to keep waiting around for an actual raise, so I quit very shortly after that to move to a major cloud computing company as a cloud support engineer. I ended up hating that company almost immediately because of their lack of training, vague protocols, poor documentation and how they clearly viewed their support department as an after thought. Only 2 or 3 months out of training, they laid off 10% of their staff including me.\n\nI've since landed a different job at another web host as a support manager. I thought I would enjoy this role but truth be told I absolutely despise my job and my company. I feel that my work is meaningless and repetitive. The agents under me are basically un-coachable and uninspired. The tech debt is immense. The higher ups are too focused on pushing out half baked products that barely work. Our back end infrastructure is a nightmare. I spend most of my time troubleshooting stuff that should have been fixed years ago, yet engineering has no plans of doing so. \n\nEssentially, I'm stuck in support hell.\n\nI really like working with computers but the past three years have left me feeling so drained that I hardly have the energy to upskill and find a better, non-customer facing role. I don't like working in tech support and I don't like working in tech support management. I constantly think about working on certs to get a job as an SRE or DevOps engineer, but I'm worried that I'd find myself in the same position of not finding any satisfaction in it. Plus the tech market is so competitive now that I feel like I don't know where to even start. I'm left with the question of \"do I want to leave the tech world or do I just hate working in support?\"\n\nHas anyone else broken out of support hell into a more technical, non customer facing role? What did it take? Did it reshape your opinion of your work? Do you find it more fulfilling? ",

        "author": "SeniorIdiot",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "\\[Senior DevOps Engineer, 17 YOE\\]\n\nHi. I'm at a crossroads in my life and I don't know what to do. I'm terrified and fearless at the same time.\n\nI'm 46 years old and so tired. Not just from work but tired in a way that's way deeper. A life of illness, stress, chaos, C-PTSD and then when I finally got back on my feet again - four more years of illness, cancer, surgeries. My body is scarred and worn down, even as my brain still wanting more of something. It's exhausting being in a brain that still dreams, in a body that can't keep up. No friends, no one to love. Just me.\n\nAt work, I tried to find meaning by stepping up. Looking at the bigger picture, connecting people, fighting for the things that make engineering great - systems that work, accountability, sustainability. What I really want to do is to bridge gaps, to build something... with joy. I'm operating at the Staff Engineer level alone - because no-one else is - and it's like threading mud in minus 20 degrees. Reality is fcking brutal and is weighing me down; it's eating away at my core values and taking all the fun out of my life.\n\nWhile management has fantastically supported me during my illness, they also lack true leadership. Fourteen years after starting the company the structure and behaviors are still stuck in start-up mode and often ends up looking for simple solutions to complex problems - or hope they will go away by themselves. The inertia is frustrating like... fck!!! Then there is the \"senior founder dev\" who only cares about code, knows he is untouchable, makes everything harder, belittles others, poisons the culture. And the colleagues I love and respect; the ones I thought could carry this with me, I can feel them pulling away, finding their own exits.\n\nIt has left me doubting; if that is the right word... what am I even holding onto? What the hell am I doing? What is the point??? :( \n\nI've lost joy in the work, but I still have passion when I can help people become better. My values haven't changed, but I have to push them aside every day, compromise after compromise, and that has slowly eroded my self-confidence and self-worth. I still want to work with smart, passionate people, to build something that matters - a product, a service, something that makes life a little bit better for someone else. I really do care about things running well. I care about people. But instead of feeling part of that, I feel stuck. I keep falling behind in technology while I fight my body (that tend to just shut down for three hours after lunch time). I'm trying to \"catch up\" and but I never quite get there...\n\nAnd outside of all this what I really crave is something... simpler and slower, I just don't know what. A house in the countryside maybe. A place that feels like home. Work that connects to who I am, not just what I can grind out. Maybe I should move back north and try to reconnect with my old friends and just do something outside of tech?\n\nWhat I don't know is how to get there without breaking more pieces of myself in the process. How to leave without bitterness and to stop running on fumes and start moving toward something I can actually love again.\n\n*tldr; my life isn't perfect, but I'm still here fighting - but there is no joy left and I've lost myself.*\n\n*PS. English is my secondary language and I closed my Grammarly account so apologize if the text is messy.*\n\n",

        "content": "Several years ago, it seemed the mindset is they are only posting for the ideal candidate and you should apply anyway.  Now, it seems as if you meet every bullet point, you're still not the ideal candidate unless you have a lot more. \n\nI know this looks negative and lazy, but the problem is that in the last 5-10 interviews, I've literally had no notes on what I could prepare for next time as 99% of what I prepared for wasn't even related to the interview, and all the questions were framed like, \"Do you know Spring Boot?  Do you know Angular?\"  Even saying yes, they didn't ask me any questions to demonstrate that I knew it.  \n\nSo, the reason I haven't been applying much is that because when I finally do get an interview, I either nailed it and still get rejected for silly reasons, or I didn't get anything out of it, and with all that time of preparation and then the interview, I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber instead, so it's not really me being negative and thinking nothing is worth it, but more that interviews have become too much of a time investment with no return on it of either getting the job or getting more relevant interview practice. \n\nA bit about my background, I worked with Cognizant for 2 years mostly on the bench and on projects they ended up offshoring before any relevant experience and one job I got with an airline company, a month in they decided to disband the team because there wasn't enough work to be done and they just combined the services to other teams because we were spending several hours per day doing almost nothing.\n\nI don't feel I've ever been given a chance on any of my consulting projects as they seemed to only be using me as a contractor for a possible project not set in stone and ended up releasing me after budget cuts or offshoring. \n\nSo, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.  \n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way, or am I being ridiculous and a negativity spreader?

        "content": "I’m 24 and I have 2YOE at a big tech company. I graduated with an above average GPA for my degree (3.4) but nothing to write home about. I don’t find software particularly fun, and I don’t see myself doing this long term. It was the only job I could get with my skill set at that point of time. I’ve always found ML to be really cool and I’ve done a research internship in this field. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to get any ML engineer or data scientist jobs right out of undergrad (they wouldn’t even interview me). I suspect the lack of a graduate degree to be the reason, and many job postings I find interesting ask for or prefer one. \n\nHow can I pivot to a more quantitative role from SWE. If I continue working as a SWE I’m afraid I will be stuck. I’ve been contemplating going back for a Masters but a few things irk me:\n\n1. I don’t want to pay 5 figures for a masters, and funded masters often ask for TA and research experience, which I lack. I did go to a competitive school so maybe my GPA can be contextualized — hard to say though. I am in state for Texas, and I could potentially pay for TAMU or UT for a semester and gamble on getting a TA position.\n2. Opportunity cost. Say I do get a masters, there’s no guarantee I will get a job in ML, and I would end up working as a SWE anyway. Minus 2 years of comp\n3. There’s millions of MS CS grads in the market and I would be competing with them for jobs in an already shaky market.\n\nAnyone who’s been through this song and dance want to chime in? In my company moving internally to a research role is very rare so that’s not possible. I really enjoyed my ML research and coursework, and I am open to working for a university lab as a researcher, as a pathway for a PhD. The lab I interned at has changed direction and focuses more on computational biology, the ML project was a one off I guess. So there’s no going back to that. My long term goal is doing applied ML at a company or in academia. This is highly coveted and competitive, so any input would be appreciated.",

The first interview was behavioral, which was amazing because that lessened SO MUCH PRESSURE, but now I'm concerned about the second interview!\n\nI was studying data structures & algorithms; seemed to be the thing I forgot the most of, and will most likely continue studying it to get it back in my head, but I keep having small hiccups. One main problem I am noticing is my organizational skills regarding programming. Don't get me wrong, I know how to code, but by the time VSC or PyCharm is opened in front of me, I blank on where to start. A great example of this is when I'm writing code, I'm mainly using ChatGPT to get the baseline, then modify it from there, or look at examples and modify it to my liking. Is there any methods I should be doing? \n\nFinally, is there anything that I definitely need to remember? It's been a while and was just wondering for a great place to start again, back to basics for a refresher if that's the case? Any help is greatly appreciated. I truly wish to succeed with this job interview and I'm nervous that I'm going to fail. \n\nThank you,   \nFrom a Grad Student who's never been in the Software Developer field and lost some knowledge on programming <3",

I live in Canada but work on remote team with my peers all over the world. I’ve been given an opportunity for a higher position but it would require me to move to the US and the company will sponsor me and take care of moving costs etc.\n\nMy unique situation is I live close to the border and my office in the US is about 1.5 hr drive each way. My family does not really want to move to the US and I don’t want to leave them full time either. I was thinking of renting an apartment 30 min or so across the border and just staying the 3-4 days a week and spending the rest of the week at home in Canada. I could literally only do 1 day in the US per week if I wanted because we have a lax RTO policy. Is this doable? How many days a year do I need to say in the US to fulfill the visa terms etc?\n\nIn terms of cost, based on the pay raise, the bump in us salary and just overall extra benefits working in the US I’d still come out 20-30% ahead after paying for an apartment etc (low cost of living in this area). Also it would be a huge jump in my career and would allow me to move up multiple salary bands much faster compared to staying in Canada. It would also allow my partner to be a stay at home parent which they’ve wanted to do for years now.\n\n",

They are asking me to meet with hiring managers etc.\n\n**Issue 1: Should I be considering this job with <1 yoe?**\n\n* The new job is better paying (by about 20k looking at base, and 60k if I expect their stock to have any value anytime soon).\n* Has better benefits (free food, better RTO policy)\n* Has less name recognition and isn't in an interesting field, IMO\n* Looks like it may have better WLB than my better gig, but not by much, and the startup does have busy oncalls \n\nFor reference, I'm... mostly happy with my current gig - it is very busy, but I am learning a good amount, have a good team and feel like I'm on path to get promoted by next year. The product I'm working on is somewhat interesting, but still better than what I would work on at this new startup.  \n  \n I am worried about layoffs in my current company (there has been some chatter about it happening next year) but nothing has happened yet, so I can't really make a decision on that. Another consideration is I'm on an open work visa, so though I can easily switch companies right now, sticking to my current big company may be safer later on if I need immigration support.\n\n**Issue 2: If I say no, how do I say no?**\n\nIDEALLY I would like to be on good terms with this company in case things turn south and I NEED to switch companies. I'm not sure what excuse to give here - I decided to stay because of promotions? Make up a raise or some other reasons? \n\nAlso, if I want to say no, I should say no NOW before meeting with the hiring managers, right? I think meeting up with HMs with no intention of joining is a bit too much, and I don't want to waste their time (interviews I don't mind because they probably do a ton of them anyway).\n\nThoughts?",
