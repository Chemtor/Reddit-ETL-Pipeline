To be honest regardless of the the fivetran acquisition, dbt-core never got any improvement over time. And it always neglected community contributions. \n\n[OpenDBT](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt) fork is created to solve this problem. Enabling community to extend dbt to their own needs and evolve opensource version and make it feature rich.\n\n[OpenDBT](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt) dynamically extends dbt-core. It's already adding significant features that aren't in the dbt-core. This is a path toward a complete community-driven fork.\n\nWe are inviting developers and the wider data community to collaborate. \n\nPlease check out the features we've already added, star the repo, and feel free to submit a PR! \n\n[https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt)",

Our team's trying to build out our analytics infrastructure and our IT department has set up **completely separate environments** for DEV, UAT, and PROD including:\n\n* Separate Snowflake accounts for each environment\n* Separate managed Airflow deployments for each environment\n* GitHub monorepo with protected branches (dev/uat/prod) for code (In fact, this is what I asked for. IT dept tried to setup polyrepo for n different projects but I refused)\n\nThis setup is causing major challenges or at least I do not understand how to:\n\n* As far as I am aware, zero copy cloning doesn't work across Snowflake accounts, making it impossible to easily copy production data to DEV for testing\n* We don't have dedicated DevOps people so setting up CI/CD workflows feels complicated\n* Testing ML pipelines is extremely difficult without realistic data given we cannot easily copy data from prod to dev account in Snowflake\n\nI've been reading through blogs & docs but I'm still confused about what's standard practice for this circumstance. I'd really appreciate some real-world insights from people who've been in similar situations.\n\n# This is my best attempt to distill the questions:\n\n* For a small team like ours (4 people handling all data work), is it common to have completely separate Snowflake accounts AND separate Airflow deployments for each environment? Or do most companies use a single Snowflake account with separate databases for DEV/UAT/PROD and a single Airflow instance with environment-specific configurations?\n* How do you handle testing with production-like data when you can't clone production data across accounts? For ML development especially, how do you validate models without using actual production data?\n* What's the practical workflow for promoting changes from DEV to UAT to PROD? We're using GitHub branches for each environment but I'm not sure how to structure the CI/CD process for both dbt models and Airflow DAGs without dedicated DevOps support\n* How do you handle environment-specific configurations in dbt and Airflow when they're completely separate deployments? Like, do you run Airflow & dbt in DEV environment to  generate data for validation and do it again across UAT & PROD? How does this work?\n\nAgain, I have tried my best to arcitulate the headaches that I am having and any practical advice would be super helpful. \n\nThanks in advance for any insights and enjoy your rest of Sunday!",

I deployed a local Git server, maintain and own the DB instance that hosts our DWH, re-implemented and redesigned Python dashboards because the old implementation was slow and useless, deployed some infrastructure for data engineering workloads, developed cli frameworks to cut-off manual work and code redundancy, and harmonized inconsistent sources to produce accurate insights (they used to just dump Excel files and DB tables into SSIS, which generated wrong numbers) all locally.\n\nLast Thursday, we got a request with a deadline on Sunday, even though Friday and Saturday are our weekend (I’m in Egypt, and my team is currently working from home to deliver it, for free).\n\nAt first, I didn’t mind because I wanted to deliver and learn, but now I’m getting frustrated. I barely have time to rest, let alone learn new things that could actually help me grow (technically or financially).\n\nUnpaid overtime is normalized here, and changing companies locally won’t fix that. So I’ve started thinking about moving to Europe, but I’m not sure I’m ready for such a competitive market since everything we do is on-prem and I’ve never touched cloud platforms.\n\nAnother issue: I feel like the only technical person in the office. When I talk about software design, abstraction, or maintainability, nobody really gets it. They just think I’m “going fancy,” which leaves me on-call. \n\nOne time, I recommended loading all our sources into a 3rd normal form schema as a single source of truth, because the same piece of information was scattered across multiple systems and needed tracking, enforcement, and auditing before hitting our Kimball DWH. They looked at me like I was a nerd trying to create extra work.\n\nI’m honestly feeling trapped.\nShould I keep grinding, or start planning my exit to a better environment (like Europe or remote)?\nAny advice from people who’ve been through this?\n",

I recently implemented this type in e6data's query engine and I realized that resources on the implementation details are scarce. The parquet variant spec is great, but it's quite dense and it takes a few reads to build a mental model of variant's binary format.\n\nThis blog is an attempt to explain why variant is so much faster than JSON strings (Databricks says it's 8x faster on their engine).

Superset seems to also have at least some kind of support for Ducklake, so I wanted to try that as well.\n\nSo I set up an EC2 where I pull a git repo and then spin up few docker compose services. First service is postgres that acts as a metadata for both Superset and Ducklake. Then Superset service spins up nginx and gunicorn that run the BI layer.\n\nActual ETL can be done anywhere on the EC2 (or Lambdas if you will) but basically I'm just pulling data from open source API's, doing a bit of transformation and then pushing the data to Ducklake. Storage is S3 and Ducklake handles the parquet files there.\n\nSuperset has access to the Ducklake metadata DB and therefore is able to access the data on S3.\n\nTo my surprise, this is working quite nicely. The only issue seems to be how Superset displays the schema of the Ducklake, as it shows all the secrets of the connection URI (:\n\nI don't want to publish the git repo as it's not very polished, but I just wanted to maybe raise discussion if anyone else has tried something similar before?\nThis sure was refreshing and different than my day to day job with big data.\n\nAnd if anyone has any questions regarding setting this up, I'm more than happy to help!",

        "content": "Hi everyone, hope get some advice from you guys.\n\nRecently I joined a company where the current project I’m working on goes like this:\n\nData lake store daily snapshots of the data source as it get updates from users and we store them in parquet files, partition by date. From there so far so good.\n\nIn dbt, our source points only to the latest file.\nThen we have an incremental model that:\nApply business logic , detected updated columns, build history columns (valid from valid to etc)\n\nMy issue: our history is only inside an incremental model , we can’t do full refresh. The pipeline is not reproducible\n\nMy proposal: add a raw table in between the data lake and dbt \n\nBut received some pushback form business: \n1. We will never do a full refresh \n2. If we ever do, we can just restore the db backup \n3. You will increase dramatically the storage on the db \n4. If we lose the lake or the db, it’s the same thing anyway \n5. We already have the data lake to need everything \n\nHow can I frame my argument to the business ? \n\nIt’s a huge company with tons of business people watching the project burocracy etc.\n\nEDIT: my idea to create another table will be have a “bronze layer” raw layer whatever you want to call it to store all the parquet data, at is a snapshot , add a date column. With this I can reproduce the whole dbt project ",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "As part of a wider move towards data products as well as building better controls into our pipelines, we’re looking at how we can implement data contracts as code. I’ve done a number of proof of concepts across various options and currently the Open Data Contract Specification alongside datacontract-cli is looking good. However, while I see how it can work well with “frozen” contracts, I start getting lost on how to allow schema evolution. \n\nOur typical scenarios for Python-based data ingestion pipelines are all batch-based, consisting of files being pushed to us or our pulling from database tables. Our ingestion pattern is to take the producer dataset, write it to parquet for performant operations, and then validate it with schema and quality checks. The write to parquet (with PyArrow’s ParquetWriter) should include the contract schema to enforce the agreed or known datatypes. \n\nHowever, with dynamic schema evolution, you ideally need to capture the schema of the dataset to be able to compare it to your current contract state to alert for breaking changes etc. Contract-first formats like ODCS take a bit of work to define, plus you may have zero-padded numbers defined as varchar in the source data you want to preserve, so inferring that schema for comparison becomes challenging. \n\nI’ve gone down quite a rabbit hole now and am likely overcooking it, but my current thinking is to write all dataset fields to parquet as string, validate the data formats are as expected, and then subsequent pipeline steps can be more flexible with inferred schemas. I think I can even see a way to integrate this with dlt. \n\nHow do others approach this?",

Is it possible or worthwhile to use AstroCli (free version) in Airflow in production or do you have to pay for using the product outside of the local host?   Does anyone see a benefit to using Astronomer over just Airflow? \n\nWhat do you think of the tool?  Or is it easier to just dbt in Snowflakes dbt projects??? \n\nSorry if this question is stupid, I just get confused by these softwares that are free and paid as to what is for what. ",

        "author": "Mysterious-Sky5410",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone, I’ve been working at a WITCH company for about a year now, as a Data Engineer. I’ve been in the same project throughout, where I mainly handle support tasks— documentation, debugging, adding columns, updating views, ensuring data flow, and just ensuring everything runs smoothly. Essentially, I’m not involved in any real development work like building pipelines or writing scripts.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of posts about people in similar situations, like the one here [Need career advice – Am I a Data Engineer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineersindia/comments/1nf3h0u/need_career_advice_am_i_a_data_engineer_how_do_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) , and it feels like I’m in the same boat. The problem is, I’ve been stuck in this role for a year, and I honestly feel like if I stay for another year or two, I won’t learn anything new. I’ve been trying to switch jobs and have been applying for the last 3-4 months, but most of the time, I don’t even make it past the shortlisting stage. I don’t blame the companies, to be honest—I just don’t have anything unique to show in my experience section. I’ve worked on some personal projects, but that’s about it.\n\nAnother challenge is the 90-day notice period. It’s hard to move quickly when companies need immediate joiners, so I feel stuck in that regard too.\n\nI see two possible options right now:\n\nAsk to be released from my current project: But this is tricky. I’m not sure if they’ll even let me go (seniors have told that release is not provided easily), and if I do get released, I’m worried the next project might be even worse. Plus, I don’t know how long I’d be able to stay on the bench, and that’s also not ideal.\n\nResign and serve the notice period quietly: This comes with its own set of risks, mainly the uncertainty of not having a job while I keep applying. The idea of not having a stable income while job hunting scares me.\n\nSo, I guess I’m at a crossroads. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Any advice on how I should proceed from here?   \n  \nI don't want to be stuck here in this swamp in the early stages of my career as it will also affect my future career path. I have been making few more personal projects to add but I still don't think that will be enough.\n\nAppreciate any insights or suggestions!\n\nTL/DR : I’ve been working as a Data Engineer in a WITCH company for a year, mostly handling support tasks with no real development experience. I’ve been trying to switch jobs for 3-4 months but keep getting rejected. I’m stuck with a 90-day notice period and feel like I’m not learning anything new. Should I ask to be released from my project (with no guarantee of better work) or resign and serve the notice period while job hunting (despite the risk of unemployment)?",

Therefore, I want to download the files and store them temporarily, upload them to Google Drive and then remove them.\n\nFirst, I tried to download them to a lakehouse, but I then understood that removing files in Lakehouse is only a soft-delete and that it still stores it for 7 days, and I want to avoid being billed for all those GBs...\n\nSo, to my question. ChatGPT proposed that I download the files into a folder like \"/tmp/\\*filename.csv\\*\", and supposedly when I do that I use the ephemeral memory created when running the notebook, and then the files will be automatically removed when the notebook is finished running.\n\nThe solution works and I cannot see the files in my lakehouse, so from my point of view the solution works. BUT, I cannot find any documentation of using this method, so I am curious as to how this really works? Have any of you used this method before? Are the files really deleted after the notebook finishes? Is there any better way of doing this? \n\n  \nThankful for any answers!\n\n ",

        "content": "Thoughts on using Synthetic Data for Projects ?\n\nI'm currently a DB Specialist with 3 YOE learning Spark, DBT, Python, Airflow and AWS to switch to DE roles.\n\nI’d love some feedback on a portfolio project I’m working on. It’s basically a modernized spin on the kind of work I do at my job, a Transaction Data Platform with a multi-step ETL pipeline.\n\nQuick overview of setup:\n\nDB structure:\n\nDimensions = Bank -> Account -> Routing\n\nFact = Transactions -> Transaction\\_Steps\n\nHistory = Hist_Transactions -> Hist_Transaction_Steps (identical to fact tables, just one extra column) \n\nI mocked up 3 regions -> 3 banks per region -> 3 accounts per bank -> 702 unique directional routings.\n\nA Python script first assigns following parameters to each routing:\n\ntype (High Intensity/Frequency/Normal)\n\ncountry\\_code, region, cross\\_border\n\nbase\\_freq, base\\_amount, base\\_latency, base\\_success\n\nvolatility vars (freq/amount/latency/success)\n\nThen the synthesizer script uses above paramters to spit out 85k-135k records per day, and 5x times Transaction\\_Steps \n\nAnomaly engine randomly spikes volatility (50–250x) \\~5 times a week for a random routing, the aim is (hopefully) the pipeline will detect the anomalies.\n\nPipeline workflow:\n\nBatch runs daily (simulating off business hours migration).\n\nEvery day data older than 1 month in live table is moved to history tables (partitioned by day and OLTP compressed) \n\nThen the partitions older than a month in history tables are exported to Parquet (maybe I'll create a Data lake or something) cold storage and stored. \n\nThe current day's transactions are transformed through DBT, to generate 12 marts, helping in anomaly detection and system monitoring \n\nA Great Expectation + Python layer takes care of data quality and Anomaly detection\n\nFinally for visualization and ease of discussion I'm generating a streamlit dashboard from above 12 marts.\n\nMain concerns/questions:\n\n1. Since this is just inspired by my current work (I didn’t use real table names/logic, just the concept), should I be worried about IP/overlap ?\n2. I’ve done a barebones version of this in shell+SQL, so I personally know business and technical requirements and possible issues in this project, it feels really straightforward.  Do you think this is a solid enough project to showcase for DE roles at product-based-companies / fintechs (0–3 YOE range)?\n3. Thoughts on using synthetic data? I’ve tried to make it noisy and realistic, but since I’ll always have control, I feel like I'm missing something critical that only shows up in real-world messy data?\n\nWould love any outside perspective\n\nThis would ideally be the portfolio project, and there's one more planned using spark where I'm just cleaning and merging Spotify datasets from different types (CSV, json, sqlite, parquet etc) from Kaggle, it's just a practice project to showcase spark understanding. \n\n**TLDR:**  \nBuilt a synthetic transaction pipeline (750k+ txns, 3.75M steps, anomaly injection, DBT marts, cold storage). Looking for feedback on:\n\n* IP concerns (inspired by work but no copied code/keywords)\n* Whether it’s a strong enough DE project for Product Based Companies and Fintech. \n* Pros/cons of using synthetic vs real-world messy data",

The transformation in the pipeline is just as simple as select one huge table, do broadcast joins with a couple small tables (I have made sure all joins are done as \\`BroadcastHashJoin\\`), and then project the DataFrame into multiple output legs.\n\nI had a few assumptions that turns out to be plain wrong, and this mistake really f\\*\\*ks up the performance.\n\n**Assumption 1:** I thought Spark will scan the table once, and just read it from cache for each of the projections. Turns out, Spark compiles the CTE into inline query and read the table thrice.\n\n**Assumption 2**: Because Spark read the table three times, and because Delta doesn't support bucketization, Spark distributes the partition for each projection leg without guarantee that rows that share the same \\`date\\` will end up in the same worker. The consequence of this is a massive shuffling at the end before writing the output to Delta, and this shuffle really kills the performance.\n\nI have been thinking about alternative solutions that involve switching stack/tools, e.g. use pySpark for a fine-grained control, or switch to vanilla Parquet to leverage the bucketization feature, but those options are not practical. Do you guys have any idea to satisfy the above two requirements: (a) scan table once, and (b) ensure partitions are distributed consistently to avoid any shuffling.",

        "author": "fabkosta",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Recently I have been contemplating the idea of a \"data ontology\" on top of Apache Iceberg. The idea is that within a domain you can change data schema in any way you intend using default Apache Iceberg functionality. However, when you publish a data product such that it can be consumed by other data domains then the schema of your data product is frozen, and there is some technical enforcement of the data schema such that the upstream provider domain cannot simply break the schema of the data product thus causing trouble for the downstream consumer domain. Whenever a schema change of the data product is required then the upstream provider domain must go through an official change request with version control etc. that must be accepted by the downstream consumer domain.\n\nObviously, building the full product would be highly complicated with all the bells and whistles attached. But building a small PoC to showcase could be achievable in a realistic timeframe.\n\nNow, I have been wondering:\n\n1. What do you generally think of such an idea? Am I onto something here? Would there be demand for this? Would Apache Iceberg be the right tech for that?\n\n2. I could not find this idea implemented anywhere. There are things that come close (like Starburst's data catalogue) but nothing that seems to actually technically enforce schema change for data products. From what I've seen most products seem to either operate at a lower level (e.g. table level or file level), or they seem to not actually enforce data product schemas but just describe their schemas. Am I missing something here?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "At work (30-person B2B SaaS), we’re currently debating evolving our data schema. The founders cobbled something together 10 years ago on AWS and through some patching and upgrading, we’ve scaled to 10,000 users, typically sales reps.\n\nOne challenge we’ve long faced is data analysis. We take raw JSON records from CRMs/VOIPs/etc, filter them using conditions, and turn them into performance records on another table. These “promoted” JSON records are then pushed to RedShift where we can do some deeper analysis (such as connecting companies and contacts together, or tying certain activities back to deals, and then helping clients to answer more complex questions than “how many meetings have my team booked this week?”). Without going much deeper, going from performance records back to JSON records and connecting them to associated records but only those that have associated performance… Yeah, it’s not great. \n\nThe evolved data schema we’re considering is a star schema making use of our own model that can transform records from various systems into this model’s common format. So “company” records from Salesforce, HubSpot, and half a dozen all CRMs are all represented relatively similarly (maybe a few JSON properties we’d keep in a JSON column for display only). \n\nCurrent tables we’re sat on are dimensions for very common things like users, companies, and contacts. Facts are for activities (calls, emails, meetings, tasks, notes etc) and deals.\n\nMy worry is that any case of a star schema being used that I’ve come across has been for internal analytics - very rarely a multi-tenant architecture for customer data. We’re prototyping with Tinybird which sits on top of Clickhouse. There’s a lot of stuff for us to consider around data deletion, custom properties per integration and so on, but that’s for another day. \n\nDoes this overall approach sit ok with you? Anything feel off or set off alarm bells? \n\nAppreciate any thoughts or comments!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Some fact tables are fairly straightforward, others can be very complicated. I'm working on a extremely complicated composite metric fact table, the output metric is computed queries/combinations/logic from \\~15 different business process fact tables. From a quality standpoint I am very concerned about transparency and explainability of this final metric. So, in addition to the metric value, I'm also considering writing to the fact the values which were used to create the desired metric, with their vintage and other characteristics. So, for example if the metric M=A+B+C-D-E+F-G+H-I; then I would not only store each value, but also the point in time it was pulled from source \\[some of these values are very volatile and are essentially sub queries with logic/filters\\]. For example: A\\_Value = xx, B\\_Value = yyy, C\\_value = zzzz, A\\_TimeStamp = 10/24/25 3:56AM, B\\_Timestamp = 10/24/25 1:11AM, C\\_Timestamp = 10/24/25 6:47AM.\n\nYou can see here that M was created using data from very different points of time, and in this case the data can change a lot within a few hours. \\[data is not only being changed by a 24x7 global business, but also by system batch processing on schedule\\] If someone else uses the same formula, but data from later points in time they might get a different result (and yes, we would ideally wish A,B,C...  to be from the same point in time). \n\n\n\nIs this a design pattern being used? Is there a better way? Is there resources I can use to learn more about this? \n\n  \n\n\nAgain, I wouldn't use this in all designs, only those of sufficient complexity to create better visibility as to \"why the value is what it is\" (when others might disagree and argue because they used the same formula with data from different points in time or filters). \n\n\\*\\* note: I'm considering techniques to ensure all formula components are from the same \"time\" (aka: using time travel in Snowflake, or similar techniques) - but for this question, I'm only concerned about the data modeling to capture/record artifacts used for data quality / explainability.

With multiple CPU bound tasks running in parallel, my machine can't handle them all and as a results the tasks become really slow.\n\nI've read the docs and asked AI on how to setup a cluster with Celery, but all of this is quite confusing. After setting up a celery broker, how can I tell Airflow which servers to connect to? For me, I can't grasp the concept just by reading the docs. Looking online only have introductions about how the Executor works, not in detail and not going into the code much.\n\nAll of my tasks are docker containers run with DockerOperators, so I think running on a different machine would be easy.

        "author": "DataByte7389",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Background: I’m finishing up my last year in my M.S. program studying a mixture of Data Analytics and Information Systems. Before grad school, I spent a little over 4 years working remotely at a med-tech startup (around 500 people) in product management. It was a great learning experience but also very stressful. They constantly overloaded me, interfered with my school schedule (when I was working part-time in undergrad), worked late into the night constantly, and broke promises around pay and promotions.\n\nI eventually left when I started my master’s, mainly for my own sanity and so I could focus on my health, school, and my relationship. I made sure to leave on good terms since I still really like the company and the products they are creating. It’s a small, niche industry, so I wanted to keep that bridge intact.\n\nThis past summer, I interned at a manufacturing company that works in the AI/data center space. My role started as Systems Analyst but turned into more of a Data Engineering internship by the end of it. I learned a lot, but the culture was rough on my team. They didn’t really want an intern, and it was a pretty cold and dry environment with them being too busy to interact with me the whole summer. I very much had to figure out a lot of things on my own since I had to use tools and create projects I never had experience with ever. To add, this was just an issue with the team I was on, other interns had a great time on different teams. It made me consistently miss the energy and connection I had with my old coworkers at the startup, which is something I think I value a lot on a team.\n\n-Decision-\n\nThe manufacturing company gave me a full-time offer for after graduation. It is a Sr Engineer role with a total comp of 145k (Yearly Breakdown: $105k base + 10% bonus + around 30k in stock). It’s stable, the benefits are great, and they even mentioned I might rotate through different engineering areas to choose a spot I like. But most likely due to company necessity I will end up in the same team (Data Engineering) I was with before since they are spread extremely thin. I am nervous about the role since they are asking me to do projects that I have little to no experience doing with little support just like the internship. It makes me afraid (A bit of imposter syndrome?) that I will not succeed in the role since I come from a more business / analytics background. \n\nBut recently I also got contacted by my old company, who’s entering a big growth phase, and they asked if I’d consider coming back to the product team after graduation. They’ve made promises that they’ve reduced a lot of the work and the emergency late nights by creating a new team to manage them. I would focus more on actual product management and problem solving if I came back. They implied they would consider hiring me remotely again but are pushing for me to instead relocate to their HQ (based in Seattle when I am currently on the east coast). I’ve not received an offer yet as we are going back and forth still but I am familiar with the salary range based off of my co-workers. Estimated Breakdown: 80-97k Base + 10-15% Bonus + 12.5k in RSUs. \n\nPart of me wants to go back because I really loved the people and the work. But I’m scared of ending up in the same stressful situations again along with all the promises that were broken before and if they can keep them. Also scared that I won’t have much growth since they do not promote often in PM. On the other hand, the new company is stable and pays well with clear expectations but doesn’t excite me the same way as well with other fears about the position and team.\n\nHow should I proceed? Also another thing I’m thinking about is long term on which role will let me best pursue other growth opportunities and not plateau early in my career. Any advice would be appreciated even if its outside the scope of my question.\n",

This semester, I started taking an entry level Python course required for my major, and honestly, I've never been this confused in a college class before as a junior.\n\nIt's been about two months, and I still feel completely lost. My professor teaches by using Microsoft Copilot to write all of the code, and then explains to the class what Copilot generated. I've been completing all my assignments using Copilot as well, since that's what the professor expects.\n\nHowever, one day we had a substitute professor who didn't use Copilot. He broke down each function and explained what everything did, and that was the first time I actually understood what was going on.\n\nLately, I've been seriously considering whether this major is the right fit for me. If this is what the rest of the program is like, i'm not sure I'll enjoy or even fully understand what I'm supposed to be learning. I don't want to switch majors just because of one bad experience, but it's starting to make me question if this field is really what I want to pursue longterm.\n\nSo now I'm wondering is this kind of Al heavy teaching normal for coding classes in 2025, and I'm just behind? Or is the professor not teaching correctly.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,  \nI really need to be honest about something that’s been bothering me.\n\nI recently finished my studies as a *state-certified Business Informatics Specialist (Software Development)*. During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.\n\nEvery time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.\n\nBack in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.\n\nI’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.\n\nThe good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems. I’m practicing on LeetCode, trying to solve problems on my own, and I also started following the Coding Interview University roadmap. Right now, I’m working on a new project using this approach where ChatGPT only acts as a mentor instead of a code generator. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I finally feel like I’m actually learning something.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this after finishing school or a bootcamp? How did you transition from guided learning to being able to code independently? What helped you get through the feeling of being completely lost once the structure was gone?",

I watch senior developers work, navigating massive codebases, writing complex logic line by line by themselves with without AI, debugging like it’s second nature, and I’m in awe. They don’t lean on AI for every line, they just know. And I can’t help but wonder: Will I ever get there?\n\nHere’s the raw truth: I’ve relied on AI, tutorials, copy-paste solutions, and the environment around me encourages that. It’s fast, it works, but it’s not helping me learn, not really. I feel like I’m trading understanding for convenience, and it scares me that I might never reach the level of independence I admire in senior developers.\n\nI want to break that cycle. I want to think in code, solve problems from scratch, read a complex system and understand it fully. I want to be the programmer who doesn’t just get things working, but truly knows why and how.\n\nSo I’m asking you all:\n\n1. How do I build the mindset to stop relying on AI and tutorials for every step?\n\n2. What habits or exercises actually make you confident in writing code from scratch?\n\n3. How do you go from feeling lost in a project to navigating it like a second brain?\n\nI’m ready to put in the work. I just need direction and guidance from people who’ve been there.

        "content": "So, I recently started programming again after like a year and a half of a break and I very vividly remember that every time I had a project idea that I thought was a bit too ambitious I would always put it away and I would think that it's too much for me and that I should do it some other time in the future. It wasn't until recently that I realized that that mindset can be really dumb sometimes and could even hinder your learning.\n\nNow, if you're an absolute beginner with weeks or barely 3 months of experience, then yeah start simple and work your way up. But, I'm talking about the beginners who already learned the fundamentals, those who already understand their programming language and can start making projects. Whatever it is you've been planning, just do it.\n\nBuilding projects will keep you in this loop of learning and crazy dopamine hits when you figure out how everything works. For example, right now I'm building an HTTP server with some help from a tutorial and it's something that I've always wanted to do but seemed so complex to me and now that I am doing it I feel so dumb for not starting it before because everything makes sense now, TCP packets are just a stream of bytes in order, almost no different to reading from a file and I've been reading files for months now. I would have never realized this if I had just said \"Nah, I'm not ready.\" \n\nPoint is, projects only seem impossible or difficult BEFORE you start them. When you do start them and you get through that first obstacle now the project just becomes something new but super fun. So, if you know you have the resources and the fundamental knowledge to start that one project that really interests you, just do it, don't put it off for another 3 months because you think you're not ready. You have endless learning resources, so start the project and build it by solving one problem at a time and you'll be fine.",

I know there's no definitive answer as it's mostly a personal choice but I'd like to hear different opinions to make up my mind. \n\nSo what are your thoughts about it?\n\n",

I don't know why. I start with web development, do this for a couple of weeks, and then continue with python because i saw an interesting video about it. But then i remember my interest in mobile app development. \n\nAnd it's always the same loop: start with one, continue with another language, and finally learn something different until the loop starts again. I do have the basic programming knowledge of loops, functions, etc. But i'm not a master of one specific language. Now i am wondering whether im even suitable for learning programming? On one hand i think yes, because the interest keeps coming back even though i took a break from it. On the other hand, no because i cant seem to focus and master one language. \n\n  \nAm i the only one having this struggle? Is there some way i can fix myself to master one language?",

        "content": "My son (10 years old now) started his coding adventure with the typical things that kids use - block based tools like scratch.\n\nWhen he outgrew those, he moved on to learn open web technologies.   His first two games were built using just HTML, CSS, JS using divs, images and sound apis.  Huge learning curve, and still limited in what you can do.  It didn't stop him though. More importantly, it taught him the fundamentals (arrays, variables, file management, functions, etc), and there's a lot of value in that.\n\nHe wanted to do more advanced stuff, and started learning how to use canvas with requestAnimationFrame. He even started thinking about what a collision detection algorithm would look like (with the help of AI). He never passed the experimentation phase here so a game wasn't released.  But he learned a lot more about the fundamentals.  \n\nIn all the above, he did have support & guidance from parents. So I think having the right mentorship in place is key.\n\nAlong the way, he discovered a game engine (Microsoft Makecode Arcade) which, while limited, gave him so much to build on - tilemaps, input management, animations, integrated sound/image editor, gravity, etc.  Suddenly, his games could become more complex.  Levels, hidden sections and boss battles were all easily approachable.\n\nFrom my observation, picking up the game engine was easy.  He already loosely knew what needed to happen, it was just a matter of figuring out how to do it in the engine.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say: when you want to learn to code, using a game engine on day one will speed you up, but it may also mean you're skipping some valuable fundamentals.  Perhaps, instead, start smaller and explore. Learn the fundamentals and build on it until you naturally are hitting the limits and need something more powerful.\n\nMy son also did a writeup on his experience using a game engine - [https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-built-my-first-game-using-a-game-engine/](https://www.armaansahni.com/how-i-built-my-first-game-using-a-game-engine/)\n\n(Disclosure -  Parents provided multiple rounds of feedback to ensure clarity and coherence of his writeup)",

So for me things like logic tables and lookup tables and circuits are quite intuitive now while I still struggle heavily to understand object oriented programming. Assembly is a pain in the ass at the beginning but the structure is nice as it is quite simple in its concepts. Being able to do a lot with less like addition and multiplication is fun.\n\nMy programming setup usually starts (whatever \"language\" or similar things like LaTeX) with a text editor and two to three terminals open. One for compiling or installing libraries, one for navigating the file system and one for the editor. When I code I often struggle with small syntactic errors all the time but have way less problems with things others consider difficult. Old things like Fortran and TCL are quite intuitive for me. I usually get good results by optimizing the underlying mathematical problem by using some tricks provided by the software or hardware. I usually write very specific solutions for a given scientific problem and optimize a lot by hand first. \n\nBut understanding concepts that aim to hide complexity is very difficult. I need to use the terminal to install software on Mac as I struggle with the basic pictures showing me to drag the .dmg from one folder to the next. I still have huge issues with VS code because usually the problems I get are related to git or access privileges in the background. If Mac OS was not a full blown Unix I would have been lost at work. And yes, I still write some \"code\" with pen and paper and optimize things by hand from time to time. ",

        "content": "Over the last few years, I’ve been teaching myself programming. I’m currently 32 and I wouldn’t say I’m “good” at any specific language. During these past few years, I’ve always jumped between multiple languages (C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, etc). I have basic knowledge in the languages listed, but I wouldn’t say enough to build something worth while.\n\nI do try and stick to one language, but then I’d usually get bored, see a new shiny thing, and jump towards that. Then most of the time, I’ll do a complete 360 and return to the language I initially started with. I’ve been doing this for years and always struggled just to stick to 1 language. And it feels like I’ve shot myself in the foot by not specialising in a single language to become efficient in it. \n\nI think the reason why I struggle focusing on a single language, is (in my honest opinion) ADHD. I haven’t been officially diagnosed with it, but a few friends who have it, have said it’s a common thing to hyper focus on something, then jump to something else (they work in tech themselves). And the other reason, is that I do find all languages interesting and want to learn as much as possible (which I know isn’t ideal when starting out).\n\nI do believe that my interests change quite a lot too, which is most likely another factor. Whether that’ll be attempting to make a small game, website, desktop app, etc. I’ve found it hard just to pick one language and run with it, ignoring the rest until I’ve built up good knowledge of different algorithms, data structures, design patterns etc.\n\nAs an example, my current job, they use C#/.NET for the backend services, and now my brain wants to learn C# again. But then I’m telling myself, “what’s the point, as you’d only focus on it for a few weeks/months, then your focus will change when a new shiny thing is discovered, or you get bored.”\n\nHas anyone else done the same in the past? If so, how did you combat it? Any advice would be appreciated.",

However, I feel a bit lost on what exactly I should focus on to become more attractive to future hiring managers.\n\nMy CV is relatively simple—I’ve had two internships and am currently in a junior role. I’ve also completed a few free certifications, including GitHub Foundations and OCI AI Foundations. I’ve heard that side projects and contributing to open-source projects can be valuable, but do hiring managers really prioritize these over professional experience? Would it be worth committing to a well-known certification like AWS SAA or DEV?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated—thank you!",

I’m struggling with caring about them the way the system expects me to.\n\nEvery time exams approach, I don’t feel scared, anxious, or even motivated. I just feel… detached. Because my goal isn’t to chase marks — it’s to understand, to learn, to build. What excites me isn’t memorizing for a grade, it’s learning cutting, learning something that actually connects with my future.\n\nBut the problem is that sometimes, the environment around you drains you before you even start. You see people studying hard to get top marks, while you’re there trying your best to understand — but there’s nothing to truly understand. You try to find meaning in what you study, but most teachers themselves aren’t motivated, and it kills your spark a little every day.\n\nLiving in Algeria doesn’t make it easier — the system feels heavy, exhausting, and uninspiring. You go to university, follow the hours, come back home drained, and even on your “rest days,” you don’t really rest. You just survive.\n\nAnd sometimes I ask myself: do students in other countries feel the same? Are they also fighting to keep their curiosity alive in a system that wants to turn everyone into the same mold?\n\nI’m not saying I hate studying. I actually love learning. I just wish learning wasn’t reduced to chasing numbers on a piece of paper.\n\nSo yeah, I’m excited to cut — to start my own path, to learn differently, to build something that feels alive. Because if the system can’t teach me what I was born to do, then I’ll teach myself.",

If the Enum is called SDL\\_EventType, how can it be accessed using just \"type\"? Shoudn't the condition be:\n\n`if ( e.SDL_EventType == SDL_QUIT )`\n\nThis is really burning my heard right now. As I said in a previous post, it reminds me of when I learned math at school The teacher would explain something but when it came time to actually use it, it  was someting completely different that I could not figure out by myself.

My goal in programming is simply to solve code challenges ie codewars or leetcode and overtime getbetter at it.\n\nI find those challenges very hard thoug. I started recently. I have no idea about how to create algorithms nor any computer science foundation. My strategy is to google the algorithm for a specific problem or even better I ChatGpt it, and ask it to give me the pseudocode of a certain problem and I try to translate it to code.\n\nSome people are against it. I am not sure if this is the optimal approach though. By myself unless, it is something very simple like \"write the content of a pointer\" It feels very much impossible. Even the supposedly easy challenges are hard at this stage.\n\nMy question is, how to get better at it? Do you think my approach is wrong? Do you think I should stare at the computer for days until I come up with  a solution? I am just trying to figure out how to pass this very beginner stage and  start solving things on my own.\n\nAny advice is very much welcome.\n\nMany thanks",

        "title": "Reality of CS Students in this Subreddit",
        "author": "Fwellimort",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I have over the past few years tried to help 6 CS students more directly through Discord, etc. All of whom claimed to be grinding, etc and so forth. Here has been my thoughts on what I noticed of college students and new grads.\n\nPS: I have over a dozen of students who had DMed for help, etc as well but those have always been casual reddit chats since I don't care anymore.\n\n\n\nMy thoughts on the job market:\n\n1. Job market for new grads and interns this year looks significantly better than the past 2 years.\n\n2. Offshoring is a reality which cannot be ignored. Companies are growing talent abroad now and a lot of layoffs have had their jobs moved to offshore. Unlike the past, offshore infra and talent is there. Covid 'proved' remote work works and 'offshore' == 'remote work'. Talent does not magically get better or worse depending on where the individual is located. And paying top dollar in Canada means entirely different from paying dollar in US.\n\n3. There's just too many CS majors and CS curriculums overall have become easier so schools can make more money. And there's so many CS adjacent majors sprouting left and right on top like Information Science, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational X, Computer Science + X, Information Systems, Informatics, Software Engineering, Business Information Management, etc.\n\nAnd then there's the fact a lot of Math, Physics, Statistics, Actuarial Science, etc students are minoring in CS as well. And Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, etc students all applying to CS jobs as well.\n\nThe supply of candidates is essentially infinite relative to demand for new grads.\n\n4. Resumes all look similar end of day due to Chatgpt. And honestly, what can you expect out of students. These are students, not working professionals. Truth is, the most differentiating factor is school name on a resume before any work experience.\n\n  \nThat said, at the same time, the talent and quality of new grads have significantly deteriorated. The median talent is on the floor (if there even is a floor). And a lot of them seems to be due to:\n\n1. Schools dumbing down curriculums + grade inflation (easier to graduate).\n\n2. Students doing bare minimum in school and just studying for the job interviews. Hence you see students here with 2.0 GPAs showing off the interviews they have gotten.\n\n3. CS is now really mainstream unlike in the way past in which programming was thought to be for nerds.\n\n4. Modern devices have abstracted away so much that students did not have to grow up having to deal with all sorts of bugs, frustrations, etc on the Internet.\n\n5. Chatgpt. It does homework, vibe coding, etc. Why bother spending the hours?\n\n6. There is a whole industry to min-maxing CS related job interviews. And the quality is really high as well. And a lot of information which in the past might have needed weeks of research is readily available within minutes now.\n\n7. TikTok brainwashing towards the world of instant gratifications. Students just don't want to deal with long frustrating grinds that go nowhere, etc.\n\n8. A lot of students going in claim to be 'passionate' in CS but really they are just majoring in it for the money or lifestyle they heard on TikTok, Youtube, etc. Now, I think 'passionate' is cringe but .. these students are all just really doing the bare minimum.\n\n  \n\\--------\n\nWhy am I saying this? Well.. while I do know Youtube is a bait, my direct experience with 6 CS students in this subreddit have largely been the same as the ones I found on Youtube.\n\nIn fact, I would argue the ones on Youtube look like god talent relative to most of the 6 CS students here in this subreddit I interacted on Discord.\n\nWhat Youtube videos you might ask? This is from Coding Jesus Youtube channel which is extremely baity and really there for him to advertise his own site but...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM\\_3yM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM_3yM)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s\\_ztBwg7Vls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ztBwg7Vls)\n\nLet me just say ... most of the 6 CS students in this subreddit over the years I interacted on Discord... makes those candidates look like top talent.\n\nI have come to believe that we seriously need more gatekeeping in this field. Completely agree with Coding Jesus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA)\n\n  \nOn the hiring side, most students are flat out garbage. But the problem is **student resumes despite how well done at aggregate will always look similar before actual work experience**. \n\nHence on the company side, the only way to filter is largely by school names at aggregate. And trust me when I say this, most students at \"top schools\" nowadays are flat out garbage as well. The difference being AT LEAST the students at top schools tend to be good at Leetcode. At least that bare minimum is done.\n\nThe worst part of all this is actual talent cannot be differentiated either from the rest as well. And with so much cheaters everywhere, it's just impossible to tell who is actually good from others.\n\n  \nIt has been frustrating and a huge waste of time trying to help some students here in this subreddit only to learn that they ddn't even bother to do the bare minimum. I'm sorry but if you cannot do a basic easy-medium Leetcode question and are screaming for how the world is unfair and what not claiming you have been grinding and doing everything... then you are not fit for this field. Get out.\n\nIt's been a huge waste of my time and a huge eye opening over the years how bad most CS students are lately when it comes to CS. And the best part? Every one of them at the start talked as if they thought differently of themselves.\n\n  \nBut ya.. just me rambling. Just wanted to share this. Also, good luck college students with the job market. I know it's rough. My only real advice to you is .... well, look into C++ if you are serious about software engineering and want to differentiate yourself from others. Totally agree with this recruiter as well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA)\n\n\nNote: I still am helping one of them and plan to for the next few years (been helping for two years now). But no more after that. ",

External Business Partner conversation (direct report of #1)\n3.) Take-home assignment via Coderbyte\n4.) Discussion with CTO, including reviewing my takehome\n5.) Live leetcoding round - 2 engineers\n6.) Live system design round - 2 engineers\n7.) Behavioral interview - 1 QA engineer, 1 implementation engineer, 1 product manager\n\nAt this point, I figured I was just about done and was about to receive an offer.\n\nNo - I then received a message about them wanting me to meet their CEO for a “quick chat” - fine. As I prepare for that, I then receive another message that they just hired a new Head of Engineering and they would like me to meet with them BEFORE the CEO.\n\nInsane, right? But the market is the market so I persevere.\n\nAs I await the meeting with the Head of Engineering today, I get a call from the recruiter informing me that there was a “miscommunication” and that they will not hire in my state, NOR the one I plan to move to in a few weeks! (Florida -> Illinois) \n\nI was completely transparent about my location/relocation, with my current location being on my resume and LinkedIn (where they found me). The fact that this was not internally discussed prior to me going through the whole process is extremely inconsiderate of my and other candidates’ time.\n\nExtremely frustrating, but hey, maybe I dodged a bullet. If they are this disorganized during interviewing, it would probably be a nightmare to work for. They are also going through a re-org, after being acquired by private equity a few weeks ago.\n\nIt sucked getting the call - especially after talking to 10 people about the role - but my interview skills now are sharper.

        "content": "Hello all. I'm a software dev with about 6 years of experience. I'm in a bit of a tricky situation and need some advice. I was laid off about a year ago and was super happy to find my current role as a software dev engineer about 4 months ago. My background is mostly backend web applications with some front end work (10%) Upon arrival I found out that I'll be part of a devops team which was not a huge issue for me, I've built CICD pipelines in the past and know the basics of what might be required.\n\nAnyway, about 2 months ago I got handed this high visibility project. Basically it is a massive application monorepo and I'm in charge of the pipeline for this project. I've have been struggling to get any support from the team that manages the application. And the person who has become my \"main contact\" is constantly out of office and I'm starting to notice that the delivery target for this pipeline will get delayed. Whenever I bring up any issues to my manager he immediately dismisses my concerns and his rebuttal is \"oh that's not an issue we can resolve it by xyz\" without actually understanding the concern I'm trying to raise. I suppose I could do a better job of not \"accepting\" his answer and trying to make my point clearer but anyway we are kinda past that.\n\nThe other problem is that I've become a defacto project manager. My manager has told me to assign work to other team members and I've had to create a \"second standup\" outside of my main teams standup where we go over the tickets related to this project. My manager has set an aggressive timeline to deliver this project but I'm seeing that we will not be able to deliver it on his timeline and now I'm getting yelled at for delays. I wasn't really expecting to become a project manager for this role, I don't know how to go about dealing my manager who told me in a 1:1 that he would \"rather die than deliver this project late\"\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. On the one hand I'm thinking I can use this opportunity to learn about project management etc however I've started doing the \"project manager\" role really close to the deadline so now I'm getting people up to speed etc while we are expecting to go into production asap. But on the other I'm feeling quite overwhelmed and feeling like this was not my expectations for this role.\n\nThanks for any advice in advance!!",

It’s like the parts of my job that made me feel skilled are slowly disappearing. Every sprint feels flatter with more tickets, less creativity.\n\ni’m not ready to leave tech, but I can’t shake this fear that I’m falling behind, really. I’ve thought about moving into product or data, but I don’t even know where to start or what’s realistic anymore.\n\nhow do you keep growing when the ground keeps shifting beneath you?

I’ve been sending out my resume all over the place but I’m struggling to get a lot of bites.\n\nI’m a back-end engineer who specializes in C#, .Net and some SQL, however I’m finding that a lot of the companies I’ve been applying for demand full-stack, but the problem is that I have very little UX experience. I had been meaning to get more into that while I was on my job, but I was never really given an opportunity to learn.\n\nI started a React course a couple of months ago but I’m having a difficult time maintaining my interest in it. I’m almost considering abandoning my job search and just focusing on the course just to get it done, but even then I’ll still have fairly minimal experience with React.\n\nThe best results I’ve had so far have been individuals from recruiting companies pinging me on LinkedIn. Most of the time this results in me sending a resume to them for a contract job. I’ve had a few seem really promising but then ghost me after I get the resume. \n\nThis last week I got in touch with a contractor who was looking for a position that just so happened to be with my first team at the tech company. They fast-tracked me into an interview that ran for far longer than it should have, and actually ran over what was supposed to be a second interview. The recruiter told me they would reschedule the second interview but I haven’t heard back from them. The team wants to have someone in the role by the end of this week but now I fear that even they might not be willing to take me back, even though they have my receipts, are probably using my code, and should know what I’m capable of.\n\nAny advice? I really don’t want to have to get a masters degree or change careers if I can help it.",

        "author": "bikinbaebuatcurhat",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I'm a junior cloud engineer, working for around a year now in my first job straight out of uni. I was hired with another junior, but he has a masters and 2 prior years of work experience so I was hired for my \"potential\" whereas he was actually selected for his skillset too. I have no problem with that, I'm happy to learn and grow as fast as I can. \n\nMy manager however, seemingly doesn't want me to forget how much better he is than me. Here are some things that have been said during our 1-on-1s, without me ever mentioning him (for the story's sake, we'll call him Tyler).\n\n\"You're doing well, you don't need to compare yourself with Tyler.\" I never was.\n\n\"You are doing your tasks and learning a lot of things, *it's not super great but that's what we expect from you*. Of course we can't expect for you to be an expert. Tyler is different, he has had experience before\"\n\n\"You are real junior here to be honest, if Tyler applied for a mid level role he would've gotten in, we just hired him as a way to get him in the company. So don't worry about him.\"\n\n\"You are an early career experiment, we want to see how we can develop people from zero, but Tyler is not really a junior to be honest\"\n\nAmongst other things. I don't know if I'm just being sensitive to some very normal or mildly negative feedback, but I just don't understand how I'm supposed to respond to these. I feel like I'm having my inferiority drilled in to me again and again, even when me and Tyler are not working in even remotely similar things. I also find it not productive to have him as an arbitrary benchmark, and spend less time focusing on my performance and growth in isolation. My other coworkers are actually giving me plenty of props and good feedback and think I'm learning super fast, but I feel like I'm not perceived as good as I would've been by my manager if Tyler wasn't working alongside. If I was hired for my potential, then why don't we spend most of our attention maximizing it?\n\nAnother annoying thing is our objective setting. We've done this process twice now. The first time, I made mine quite compact and Tyler made his more elaborated. Our manager said \"we could make yours a bit more like Tyler's, see how he made his a little clearer?\". Yup, absolutely. That makes sense.\n\nBut the next cycle, he had his very short. Almost lazy. It was literally just a bullet point of the stacks he wants to learn and get to work with. Whereas I elaborated on mine more specifically. But guess what? \"We can make it similar to Tyler's one just so its easier.\"\n\nSo what the hell. I get that he's older, more educated, more experienced and most importantly, he's a he. I don't want to link these treatments to me being the only girl in the team and the youngest member by a lot, but I can't help to think those things play a part.\n\nOr, alternatively, I could be overthinking and these are perfectly normal parts of a manager's evaluations. In which case Im happy to learn to get used to it and move on with my life.\n\nI have recently had a hiring manager reach out to me for a position in a different company. I've cleared a few interview rounds and they've said they're willing to offer me a 20% pay raise, with a sign on bonus and stock which I don't currently get at my company. I don't wanna leave my current place for some other reasons that compensate the lower pay, but if this treatment isn't normal I might just consider leaving. However, that also lets me know that I don't suck, so I'm really not sure of what to think anymore now.",

During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.\n\nEvery time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.\n\nBack in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.\n\nI’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.\n\nThe good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems. I’m practicing on LeetCode, trying to solve problems on my own, and I also started following the Coding Interview University roadmap. Right now, I’m working on a new project using this approach where ChatGPT only acts as a mentor instead of a code generator. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I finally feel like I’m actually learning something.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this after finishing school or a bootcamp? How did you transition from guided learning to being able to code independently? What helped you get through the feeling of being completely lost once the structure was gone?\n\nThanks for reading. I just needed to share this somewhere where people might understand.",

Unfortunately they cannot keep me beyond 6 months so I will leave in mid-November.\n\nI’ve been having some trouble applying to entry-level jobs. I thought this internship would be the key to being able to compete but it’s looking much harder than I imagined. Granted I only recently started looking. But a lot of jobs are asking for a wide, wide variety of skills I haven’t even heard of, like XML or… Quartz. I want to build up my resume but I will be out of a job in 3 weeks.\n\nBut then I came across Revature for their “Entry Level Software Developer” position, and they actually called me. At first I was a little worried - they seemed a little too excited to have me on their team, and I remember getting myself into a MLM scheme once so it felt pretty familiar.\n\nIm reading a lot about it but can someone just explain in layman’s terms what exactly goes on at Revature? It’s a contract? At a high-level, what does this contract entail? Is it true that I’d have to relocate? I live in NJ, is it possible I’d have to fly to the West? More importantly, will I know important details like which state before signing the contract? And, is the wage livable?\n\nI’m reading that while it’s bottom of the barrel, it’s not a scam. I may be willing to look into this if I run out of options. I would do a lot to be able to have a career coding, that’s the whole damn reason I came to college.

        "content": "Nothing new I guess, this is starting to get a toll on me. Despair is setting in. Career choices, life choices, and all this affects the people around me.\n\nI'm a decent engineer. I've built stuff, I've solved problems. I know my FE shit.\n\nSince end of August I've participated in several processes, both startups and non startups. I am not in the US/UK ecosystem (S.Europe here) so I am trying to be relatively picky with my choices (I am getting less picky as we go of course).\n\nI recently was rejected after delivering a coding assignment - following two very nice (good vibes) calls with the two founders of a startup.\n\nHere is the weird part. I am pretty confident on my delivery. The assignment had a lot business detail, one had to think of what it actually needed - but thanks to AI - I delivered. Finishing touches mine, and I was prepared to answer any questions about the code. We even had a follow-up call planned to talk about the challenge.\n\n24 hours later, I receive the most generic rejection message ever - nothing about the challenge , and a cancellation of the follow-up call. I've messaged the guy who I was in touch with - and he wrote something super abstract like \"we wanted to see how you would approach the problem\" and \"we didnt see the depth we were looking for\". (honestly I dont buy it)\n\nI accidentally noticed that one of their engineers was stalking my Linkedin Profile a few hours before the rejection mail arrived. I was generally vocal about the \"AI Bubble\" and I am wondering if the fact that their business was AI-driven had something to do with it?\n\nThe other thing I am thinking is that the guy who visited my profile only did so after I spoke with the two founders so he decided for one or the other reason I am not a good fit - so they had nothing to say about the code by itself.\n\nNeedless to say this is a brutal market, and I have never seen so challenging interview processes, so lengthy filtering mechanisms. I happen to also be in a relatively small market so this might have to do with it. Remote gigs are harder to find these days.\n\nWhat the heck should I do? I am not a top 10% coder but I'm good enough for most normal businesses. I don't grind Leetcode, and I do suffer from live coding brain freeze which I am trying to battle by doing a lot of live coding interviews. But it is \\_very\\_ easy for an interviewer to find reasons to reject you.\n\nI have excellent soft skill presentation, most recruiters / HR folk are super happy with me, I present myself in an excellent manner.\n\nThe other day I was prepared to answer a specific live coding challenge following tips from the recruiter. I did it async before the call, almost memorized it.\n\nDuring live coding it, I froze because the API wasnt returning the response I was thinking it would. It took me like 5' to solve the bug.\n\nRejected",

I interned at this company during my senior year, and pretty much joined full time right after graduation (I had maybe a week off).\n\nThe company is amazing. The work life balance is great, my coworkers and boss are great, and the pay isn’t bad (especially considering I still live with my parents in a low cost of living area). I’m nearby most of my friends and have a very healthy life outside of work with multiple hobbies.\n\nYet I can’t help but feel like something feels missing. My job is right next to my house where I grew up (10 min commute) and I went to school in state only 30 ish minutes away. I feel like I haven’t seen or done anything and am missing out. I know I’m in a situation some would envy, but I just feel… bored?\n\nI’ve always been interested in the idea of joining the military, but have obviously heard horror stories about it too (hence why I never joined). But just today I was having a casual conversation with the lead engineer and he told me about his experiences in the Navy. All of the fun he had, all of the minor trouble he got into, the places he’s been, etc… It honestly sounded like a fun adventure and he said he hasn’t regretted a second of it. And obviously it didn’t impact his career negatively as he’s the lead engineer in our team.\n\nSo I guess the TL:DR is, am I crazy for considering leaving my current job to join as an Officer in the Navy/Air Force? What tech skills will I learn and how will it impact me in the future? Obviously I had my lead engineer as a resource, but I want to get a broader set of opinions too that may not be biased by previous experiences. ",

I did learn React at bootcamp and have been diving back into studying it since I know it's in higher demand. The thing is, I don't think I can mentally handle the grind in this field. When I first started out, I was hungry, driven, ambitious, and excited to code. I was extremely lucky to land a job 2 months after graduating from bootcamp, and tech was a lot easier to break into. \n\nNow I'm in my 30s, I want kids, and I don't have as much motivation to hustle.\n\nAs much as I love coding, I don't love the concept of having to grind constantly when I want to focus on family building and family life. Just the process of getting through dev interviews feels insane right now. Grinding leetcode, memorizing a ton of system design questions, doing tons of projects to practice different technologies, going through several rounds of interviews, only to possibly get rejected at the last stage? And then maybe having to do it ALL over again if you get laid off a year or 2 later? \n\nI've been studying my ass off the past few weeks and it got me thinking, if I'm finding this super exhausting now with no kids, how the hell am I gonna do this again if I were to get laid off again with a toddler or 2? Yes I would of course have support from my husband, but I don't know if it's realistic for me personally to constantly be trying to hustle at work, hustle while being laid off, and be a parent to young children. \n\nI keep seeing posts from people who have been laid off multiple times in a year and the idea of having to go through the  interview process more than once in a year sounds horrible. Plus, I SUCK at leetcode. I'm a great dev, but leetcode has always been a weakness of mine.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas of where I could pivot in tech?

I'd appreciate any strategic advice, especially concerning the current job market.\nMy Current Situation\nI lead a small team as a Tech Lead/Senior Frontend Developer. The problem is, I’m the only truly experienced frontend person here. My team members, while good people, are generally junior or mid-level, and honestly, they often just want to get tasks done with minimal effort.\n * Code Quality: The code I review is frequently poor—written just to pass the ticket, not to be clean or maintainable.\n * Stagnation Fear: When I do code reviews, I often worry that I'm not just failing to grow, but actually regressing. I have no one more experienced than me in frontend to learn from, which makes me feel professionally trapped.\n * The Dilemma: My role is to mentor them (which I try to do through detailed code reviews and discussions), but constantly dealing with low-quality code makes me paranoid that I'm absorbing bad habits myself.\nThe Challenge\nI need advice on how to combat this feeling of stagnation and ensure I keep growing my skills (especially technical ones like architecture and modern patterns).\nCrucially, I have very little time outside of work for side projects or intense studying. I need strategies to develop myself during work hours within the confines of my current role and project.\nMy Questions for the Community\n * In-Job Development: What are the most effective ways for a senior/lead to force their own growth technically when surrounded by less-experienced developers, especially when time after work is scarce? (e.g., specific code review tactics, using project architecture as a growth tool, etc.)\n * Market Strategy: Given the competitive nature of the current tech job market (layoffs, high competition for senior roles):\n   * When is the right time to leave? Should I wait until I can find a role that guarantees working with better talent?\n   * How do I best position my current leadership role (leading a small team, improving code quality) for interviews at top-tier companies that value deep technical expertise?\n * Mindset: How do you mentally cope with being the \"only source of truth\" and avoid the burnout/frustration that comes from constantly correcting fundamental issues?\nThanks in advance for any insights on maintaining momentum and making a strategic career move!\n",

I'm not interested in my team's product, state of engineering wants to pull your hair out, and my manager is borderline toxic. WLB is great and I love my people (outside of my manager), but I've felt incredibly stagnant in my career for awhile and feel miserable. I've been on a burnout for months that's been gradually increasing, and I know that things won't significantly improve anytime soon. \n\nI've originally planned to find a position within the company to transfer internally, and it's been 3 months since I started browsing around. Now, it feels like I might be better off to take a full plunge and prep for interviewing other companies for few reasons:\n\n1. I've been having golden handcuff, but my salary is tanking hard in less than a year once my 4 year RSU runs out. At that point, I'm only losing a modest amount of salary to jump ship to other company's SDE2 position (according to levels.fyi). That's not even considering a slim chance that I make the hiring bar for senior in some companies. There is no path for promotion within my current company for awhile, anyways. I've saved enough to last for awhile.\n2. Due to the company policy, it's practically impossible for me to transfer internally for another half a year without painting myself a target. Honestly unsure if my mental health will remain sane until then.\n3. I've been on GC process for a bit (completed I-140 w/ EB3 using TN). Given the state of current administration, it's very unlikely that mine will be processed in a reasonable time. Might as well keep the priority date and resume as EB-2 at another company.\n4. Tied to GC process above, I can only internally transfer to positions within my city. I'm on a branch office away from HQ, and the options are pretty small. I don't have much things to bind me to the city outside of GC process, and am honestly okay relocating.\n5. I've been border locked for the entire year, and will continue to be so until GC is approved - immigration attorney strongly advises not to travel internationally. Not only does changing company mostly address that risk (since I'll have to restart with PERM), it gives me an option to get a sizeable amount of vacation in-between jobs. I've been dying to travel abroad again, albeit this is not a big reason to sabotage anything on my job.\n\n  \nI'm leaving the team in the earliest opportunity for sure. I just need to choose between finding an internal position within my current city and company, or fully commit to searching outside. I've heard many anecdotes of how terrible the job market is now, how insane the hiring bars are. The uncertainty with recession also adds a risk of layoffs, which tends to target less contributing employees including new hires.\n\nAm I crazy to consider jumping ship in this market?",

He’s an ex-Reddit engineer with ~15 years of experience, and I come from a web background.\n\nWe’re building a pretty big multi-app Flutter + Firebase project using Clean Architecture, which is all new to me. The main struggle I’m having is that I rarely get clear requirements. Usually I’ll get something like:\n\n“We need a chat box that can also record audio.”\n\nAnd that’s it. From there, I’m expected to figure out everything — UX, architecture, edge cases, and make it up to his standards.\n\nHe doesn’t really walk me through the context or help clarify requirements; I usually just get feedback once I open my first PR. My PRs almost never meet expectations on the first few goes, and sometimes I make rookie mistakes (like forgetting to rebase), which makes me feel even worse. His feedback can be pretty blunt, too.\n\nBecause I’m still learning Flutter, Firebase, and the project structure, things take me a long time — sometimes weeks for a single feature. Even when I do understand the requirements, like for the Auth flow I’m finishing now, it’s still slow progress.\n\nI’m trying hard to improve, but it’s been rough. During my interview, I said I perform above the average junior — and he’s holding me to that, which is fair. But right now I feel like I’m constantly falling short, and I can’t tell if that’s because I’m actually underperforming… or because this setup would be tough for anyone at my level.\n\nSo I guess my question is:\n\nIs this kind of setup (basically no guidance, just tasks and expectations) normal for a junior? am I genuinely underperforming? And if you’ve been in a similar spot, what helped you get through it?\n\n\n\nTLDR:\n\nI’m a 2 YOE junior dev working under a super-senior ex-Reddit engineer. I get very vague task descriptions (e.g. “build a chat box that records audio”) and have to figure everything out myself — UX, architecture, edge cases, etc. I’m learning a new stack (Flutter + Firebase + Clean Arch), so progress is slow and feedback is tough. Not sure if I’m actually underperforming or if this setup is just rough for a junior. Looking for advice or perspective.\n",

I recently failed to pass final rounds for a couple companies, the one I got feedback from they told me I \"didn't have the complexity or scope\" in my prior roles that the hiring manager was looking for. This is something I was afraid of going in to the behavioral interviews. I have about 2.5 years of total experience, with a little over 2 at Amazon and 6 mo. on a consulting project (which was a wash because I had to take a personal leave for most of it). I didn't get a chance to show much initiative at Amazon, and the projects assigned to me were small in scope, usually solitary, and not all that technically complex. I have found ways to force them to fit a handful of scenarios, but I just don't have enough content to cover all the possible questions. On top of that it's been so long that I can't remember enough detail about my work or team interactions when an interviewer drills down on a project/topic (in retrospect I should have kept a work diary for reference). I end up having to improvise, which always goes poorly and I feel like I'm coming off as a fraud. What should I do for behavioral interviews going forward? Should I just admit to interviewers that I haven't gotten to do much and want a chance to prove myself? Make up embellishments to my experience? Find a new career? I've been unemployed searching for over a year to no avail so any advice on this would be appreciated.",

Just sharing my thoughts and if anyone has anything to offer it is welcomed.  \n  \nWorking with Java, total experience now is 4+ years.  \n  \nShort version:\n\n* Changed role accepting a pay reduction of 7% in new company.\n* 5 months in I got a 2,27% raise.\n* I got my MSc in CS.\n* 1year+2months later I accepted to talk about a role in new company just to get an assessment of what could my value be in the marketplace.\n* Without even trying hard I got an offer that comes with an increase in seniority and 25% in compensation.\n* It is too good to pass but I am feeling bad about leaving my team, it is not their fault.  \n\n  \nLonger version:\n\n* I quit last July due to conflicts with new tech lead manager in team. I didn't want to be a bad employee so I left. He didn't even care. \n* Got an offer in 2 weeks for a total of 7% less yearly compensation of my previous role and NOTE for a fintech company.\n* I was expecting a 2-times per year salary re-negotiation but policy changed.\n* I got a 2,26% salary increase last January.\n* I was promised a better raise this year.\n* I worked my ass off to evolve more. Almost finished my MSc in CS.\n* I accepted to talk about a new offer ONCE and without even trying they accessed my skill was worth a 25% increase in salary and a seniority role - I get to mentor entry/juniors.\n* It is 100% better choice for me to leave, but feeling remorse cause my current team which are great people will get destroyed.\n\n  \nSome more notes for the company:\n\n1. Year closed with 50% profit increase.\n2. New offices in new city\n3. New AI team and hired like 20 ( I am assuming expensive ) AI engineers over they year.\n4. Developer left team in January, I got his workload - no salary increase, never got a replacement.\n5. Team got 3 new projects in September.\n6. Core developer was owed 200 hours of overtime and eventually instead of paying they gave him a 4 day work week for the next few months..... SAD?\n\nSUMMARY;   \nΤo me it feels like in this company my worth is less and it gets depicted in salary.   \nCompany will try to match offer only because they are in dire position.  I don't think this much of a raise would be ever considered.  \nThis means they don't value me as they should or my worth is less here and I will be better of switching anyway.  \nThe new company is purely software development oriented vs current FINTECH.",

        "author": "shade_blade",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've kind of been feeling very demotivated and stuck, I got a few calls recently but they didn't go anywhere (said \"you'll hear by the end of the week\" and then got nothing). It's better than getting nothing like before but it still is effectively nothing. It just doesn't feel like I have anything \"compelling\" to say about any of my experience and I don't know how to get that good experience. I've been spending all day every day doing \"nothing\" (working on projects that are still unpresentable, sending applications that mostly go nowhere), I don't know what I should be doing at all. Everything I do feels like the wrong answer no matter what. Working on the projects I already have feels useless as they are not presentable (they visually look bad, they are not profitable at this moment, and have absolutely no real technical challenges to them at all)\n\nI don't feel like I have any \"difficult\" or \"interesting\" projects to show people, like I don't have anything difficult to show how I struggled because everything I did always felt \"easy\" or it always becomes \"easy\" in hindsight. Even if something took a long time to fix or figure out, in hindsight it is always easy so hiring people will see it as being easy too so I can't really talk about them being struggles. It looks badly on me if I talk about how I figured out how to find the assembly code that touches some struct value for a game mod, because any IDE nowadays would have that same functionality just 2 clicks away. And it's not really impressive for me to build a menu or web page or a web server because those are standard basic level things. It's also not impressive for me to implement some algorithm or use some API because applying some algorithm someone else already wrote is not applying my own thinking and using some API is just using someone else's code which is not impressive to do. Making my own variant chess engine isn't impressive because it's just me following a preset list of things to do to make the engine (and the new stuff is not technically difficult to do as it's more of the same techniques that I am not a pioneer of) So in any case everything I've done is not impressive, any half competent developer could do anything I've done and they would probably do it faster and better in every way.\n\nInterview / call wise I don't really know how to improve, I always feel like I give short answers but I don't know how to make them longer without rambling about useless things? (Like I can't tell them about every individual class I took in response to \"tell me about yourself\"). I don't know the way to \"fluff up\" my answers to impress them, it feels like if I try too hard it just backfires on me (like if I hype up some web page up as the best thing ever but in reality it looks like the default CSS styling (Graphic design is not my passion) it makes me look stupid). I don't even have real answers for some of the questions they have, like I can't talk about any conflicts I had with others (internships were basically me working alone on projects, class projects never had any big blowups that I was the one fixing everything completely) or talk about something I had difficulty learning about to build a project (it looks bad on me if I talk about learning something \"basic\" but I don't know anything too \"advanced\"?)\n\nMaybe I'm just not cut out for this field as the standards have gotten so much higher nowadays? Looking at another recent post about how bad current CS grads are there are questions that other people failed that I don't know the complete answer to without looking up the exact specifics. I don't memorize the exact programming language / package versions I use (and I'm not exactly using cutting edge features or the most esoteric library functions either). (I know it's just like project settings or looking at compiler settings but it isn't something I have memorized which I'm supposed to be doing?). I also don't have memorized exactly how the programming languages are implemented (like where exactly a method in a class is stored in python? I know it probably ends up in code memory and internally there is some data structure corresponding to that class and some kind of data structure for the references to the methods of the class, but I don't know the exact specifics like which specific implementation of methods and classes it is using internally)",

We landed big clients and the company was eventually bought out for a good sum of money (at least 2 million). The owners generously gave us a big bonus for the buyout and even negotiated that we keep our jobs for at least 2 years with the new company. After the period we were eventually let go and found new jobs elsewhere.\n\nYesterday I got a message from my old boss asking if id be interested in working on something on the side. I said id be interested in thinking about it, but my life is busy right now. They said theyd work around my schedule. I'm interested in hearing them out, but im wondering what i should ask for compensation. Development could possibly be split by another dev. And i would only be providing dev work. \n\n I'm not hurting for money, but im certainly not going to turn it down lol. Im sure they will probably offer me a wage or lump sum when we hit MVP, but Im more so wondering if i should ask for a share of profits. And if so how much? I should probably hear about the idea first before i decide, but they're smart people, so I have a feeling this idea could be profitable as well. ",
