        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In this opinionated article I am going to explain why I believe we have reached peak Spark usage and why it is only downhill from here.\n\n# Before Spark\n\nSome will remember that 12 years ago [Pig](https://pig.apache.org), [Hive](https://hive.apache.org), [Sqoop](https://sqoop.apache.org), [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org) and MapReduce were all the rage. Many of us were under the spell of [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org) during those times.\n\n# Enter Spark\n\nThe brilliant [Matei Zaharia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateizaharia/) started working on Spark sometimes before 2010 already, but adoption really only began after 2013.  \nThe lazy evaluation and memory leveraging as well as other [innovative features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0Tisli7zn4&t=97s) were a huge leap forward and I was dying to try this new promising technology.  \nMy then CTO was visionary enough to understand the potential and for years since, I, along with many others, ripped the benefits of an only improving Spark.\n\n# The Losers\n\nHow many of you recall companies like [Hortonworks](https://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Webinar.HDP2_.20131112.pdf) and [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/about.html)? Hortonworks and Cloudera merged after both becoming public, only to be taken private a few years later. Cloudera still exists, but not much more than that.\n\nThose companies were yesterday’s [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com) and they bet big on the Hadoop ecosystem and not so much on Spark.\n\n# Hunting decisions\n\nIn creating Spark, Matei did what any pragmatist would have done, he piggybacked on the existing Hadoop ecosystem. This allowed Spark not to be built from scratch in isolation, but integrate nicely in the Hadoop ecosystem and supporting tools.\n\nThere is just one problem with the Hadoop ecosystem…it’s exclusively **JVM based**. This decision has fed and made rich thousands of consultants and engineers that have fought with the [GC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) and inconsistent memory issues for years…and still does. The JVM is a solid choice, safe choice, but despite more than 10 years passing and Databricks having the plethora of resources it has, some of Spark's core issues with managing memory and performance just can't be fixed.\n\n# The writing is on the wall\n\nChange is coming, and few are noticing it ([some do](https://nolanlawson.com/2024/10/20/why-im-skeptical-of-rewriting-javascript-tools-in-faster-languages/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). This change is happening in all sorts of supporting tools and frameworks.\n\nWhat do [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), [Deno](https://deno.com), [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) and the Linux kernel all have in common that no one cares about...for now? They all have a Rust backend or have an increasingly large Rust footprint. These handful of examples are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nRust is the most prominent example and the forerunner of a set of languages that offer performance, a completely different memory model and some form of usability that is hard to find in market leaders such as C and C++. There is also Zig which similar to Rust, and a bunch of other languages that can be found in TIOBE's top 100.\n\nThe examples I gave above are all of tools for which the primary target are not Rust engineers but Python or JavaScipt. Rust and other languages that allow easy interoperability are increasingly being used as an efficient reliable backend for frameworks targeted at completely different audiences.\n\nThere's going to be less of \"by Python developers for Python developers\" looking forward.\n\n# Nothing is forever\n\nSpark is here to stay for many years still, hey, Hive is still being used and maintained, but I believe that peak adoption has been reached, there's nowhere to go from here than downhill. Users don't have much to expect in terms of performance and usability looking forward.\n\nOn the other hand, frameworks like [Daft](https://www.getdaft.io) offer a completely different experience working with data, no strange JVM error messages, no waiting for things to boot, just bliss. Maybe it's not Daft that is going to be the next best thing, but it's inevitable that Spark will be overthroned.\n\n# Adapt\n\nDatabricks better be ahead of the curve on this one.  \nInstead of using scaremongering marketing gimmicks like labelling the use of engines other than Spark as *Allow External Data Access*, it better ride with the wave.",

        "content": "I’ve benchmarked it. For use cases in my specific industry it’s something like x5, x7 more efficient in computation. It looks like it’s pretty revolutionary in terms of cost savings. It’s faster and cheaper.\n\nThe problem is PySpark is like using a missile to kill a worm. In what I’ve seen, it’s totally overpowered for what’s actually needed. It starts spinning up clusters and workers and all the tasks. \n\nI’m not saying it’s not useful. It’s needed and crucial for huge workloads but most of the time huge workloads are not actually what’s needed.\n\nSpark is perfect with big datasets and when huge data lake where complex computation is needed. It’s a marvel and will never fully disappear for that.\n\nAlso Polars syntax and API is very nice to use. It’s written to use only one node. \n\nBy comparison Pandas syntax is not as nice (my opinion). \n\nAnd it’s computation is objectively less efficient.  It’s simply worse than Polars in nearly every metric in efficiency terms.\n\nI cant publish the stats because it’s in my company enterprise solution but search on open Github other people are catching on and publishing metrics.\n\nPolars uses Lazy execution, a Rust based computation (Polars is a Dataframe library for Rust). Plus Apache Arrow data format.\n\nIt’s pretty clear it occupies that middle ground where Spark is still needed for 10GB/ terabyte / 10-15 million row+ datasets. \n\nPandas is useful for small scripts (Excel, Csv) or hobby projects but Polars can do everything Pandas can do and faster and more efficiently.\n\nSpake is always there for the those use cases where you need high performance but don’t need to call in artillery. \n\nIts syntax means if you know Spark is pretty seamless to learn.\n\nI predict as well there’s going to be massive porting to Polars for ancestor input datasets.\n\nYou can use Polars for the smaller inputs that get used further on and keep Spark for the heavy workloads. The problem is converting to different data frames object types and data formats is tricky. Polars is very new.\n\nMany legacy stuff in Pandas over 500k rows where costs is an increasing factor or cloud expensive stuff is also going to see it being used.\n\n",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey All,\n\nI've had an incredible year and I feel extremely lucky to be in the position I'm in. I'm a relatively new DE, but I've covered so much ground even in one year.\n\nI'm not perfect, but I can feel my growth. Every day I am learning something new and I'm having such joy improving on my craft, my passion, and just loving my experience each day building pipelines, debugging errors, and improving upon existing infrastructure.\n\nAs I look back I wanted to share some gems or bits of valuable knowledge I've picked up along the way:\n\n* Showing up in person to the office matters. Your communication, attitude, humbleness, kindness, and selflessness goes a long way and gets noticed. Your relationship with your client matters a lot and being able to be in person means you are the go-to engineer when people need help, education, and fixing things when they break. Working from home is great, but there are more opportunities when you show up for your client in person.\n* pre-commit hooks are valuable in creating quality commits. Automatically check yourself even before creating a PR. Use hooks to format your code, scan for errors with linters, etc.\n* Build pipelines with failure in mind. Always factor in exception handling, error logging, and other tools to gracefully handle when things go wrong.\n* DRY - such as a basic principle but easy to forget. Any time you are repeating yourself or writing code that is duplicated, it's time to turn that into a function. And if you need to keep track of state, use OOP.\n* Learn as much as you can about CI/CD. The bugs/issues in CI/CD are a different beast, but peeling back the layers it's not so bad. Practice your understanding of how it all works, it's crucial in DE.\n* OOP is a valuable tool. But you need to know when to use it, it's not a hammer you use at every problem. I've seen examples of unnecessary OOP where a FP paradigm was better suited. Practice, practice, practice.\n* Build pipelines that heal themselves and parametrize them so users can easily re-run them for data recovery. Use watermarks to know when the last time a table was last updated in the data lake and create logic so that the pipeline will know to recover data from a certain point in time.\n* Be the documentation king/queen. Use docstrings, type hints, comments, markdown files, CHANGELOG files, README, etc. throughout your code, modules, packages, repo, etc. to make your work as clear, intentional, and easy to read as possible. Make it easy to spread this information using an appropriate knowledge management solution like Confluence.\n* Volunteer to make things better without being asked. Update legacy projects/repos with the latest code or package. Build and create the features you need to make DE work easier. For example, auto-tagging commits with the version number to easily go back to the snapshot of a repo with a long history.\n* Unit testing is important. Learn pytest framework, its tools, and practice making your code modular to make unit tests easier to create.\n* Create and use a DE repo template using cookiecutter to create consistency in repo structures in all DE projects and include common files (yaml, .gitignore, etc.).\n* Knowledge of fundamental SQL if valuable in understanding how to manipulate data. I found it made it easier understanding pandas and pyspark frameworks. ",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently completed a data engineering screening at a startup and now I’m wondering if my approach was right and how other engineers would approach or what more experienced devs  would look for. The screening was around 50 minutes, and they had me share my screen and use a blank Google Doc to jot down thoughts as needed — I assume to make sure I wasn’t using AI.\n\nThe Problem:\n\n\t“How would you design a system to ingest ~100TB of JSON data from multiple S3 buckets”\n\nMy Approach (thinking out loud, real-time mind you):\n\t•\tI proposed chunking the ingestion (~1TB at a time) to avoid memory overload and increase fault tolerance.\n\t•\tStressed the need for a normalized target schema, since JSON structures can vary slightly between sources and timestamps may differ.\n\t•\tSuggested Dask for parallel processing and transformation, using Python (I’m more familiar with it than Spark).\n\t•\tFor ingestion, I’d use boto3 to list and pull files, tracking ingestion metadata like source_id, status, and timestamps in a simple metadata catalog (Postgres or lightweight NoSQL).\n\t•\tTalked about a medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold):\n\t•\tBronze: raw JSON copies\n\t•\tSilver: cleaned & normalized data\n\t•\tGold: enriched/aggregated data for BI consumption\n\nWhat clicked mid-discussion:\n\nAfter asking a bunch of follow-up questions, I realized the data seemed highly textual, likely news articles or similar.  I was asking so many questions lol.That led me to mention:\n\n\t•\tOnce the JSON is cleaned and structured (title, body, tags, timestamps), it makes sense to vectorize the content using embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, Sentence-BERT, etc.).\n\t•\tYou could then store this in a vector database (like Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate) to support semantic search.\n\t•\tTechniques like cosine similarity could allow you to cluster articles, find duplicates, or offer intelligent filtering in the downstream dashboard (e.g., “Show me articles similar to this” or group by theme).\n\nThey seemed interested in the retrieval angle and I tied this back to the frontend UX, because I deduced the target of the end data was a front end dashboard that would be in front of a client \n\nThe part that tripped me up:\n\nThey asked: “What would happen if the source data (e.g., from Amazon S3) went down?”\n\nMy answer was:\n\n\t“As soon as I ingest a file, I’d immediately store a copy in our own controlled storage layer — ideally following a medallion model — to ensure we can always roll back or reprocess without relying on upstream availability.”\n\nLooking back, I feel like that was a decent answer, but I wasn’t 100% sure if I framed it well. I could’ve gone deeper into S3 resiliency, versioning, or retry logic.\n\nWhat I didn’t do:\n\t•\tI didn’t write much in the Google Doc — most of my answers were verbal.\n\t•\tI didn’t live code — I just focused on system design and real-world workflows.\n\t•\tI sat back in my chair a bit (was calm), maintained decent eye contact, and ended by asking them real questions (tools they use, scraping frameworks, and why they liked the company, etc.).\n\nOf course nobody here knows what they wanted, but now I’m wondering if my solution made sense (I’m new to data engineering honestly):\n\t•\tShould I have written more in the doc to “prove” I wasn’t cheating or to better structure my thoughts?\n\t•\tWas the vectorization + embedding approach appropriate, or overkill?\n\t•\tDid my fallback answer about S3 downtime make sense ?\n",

        "content": "Hey all! \n\nOver the years, I’ve worked at companies as small as a team of 10 and at organizations with thousands of data engineers, and I’ve seen wildly different philosophies around analytical data.\n\nSome organizations go with the \"build it and they will come\" data lake approach, broadly ingesting data without initial structure, quality checks, or governance, and later deriving value via a medallion architecture.\n\nOthers embed governed analytical data directly into their user-facing or internal operations apps. These companies tend to treat their data like core backend services managed with a focus on getting schemas, data quality rules, and governance right from the start. Similar to how transactional data is managed in a classic web app.\n\nI’ve found that most data engineering frameworks today are designed for the former state, Airflow, Spark, and DBT really shine when there’s a lack of clarity around how you plan on leveraging your data. \n\nI’ve spent the past year building an open-source framework around a data stack that's built for the latter case (clickhouse, redpanda, duckdb, etc)—when companies/teams know what they want to do with their data and need to build analytical backends that power user-facing or operational analytics quickly.\n\nThe framework has the following core principles behind it:\n\n1. Derive as much of the infrastructure as possible from the business logic to minimize the amount of boilerplate\n2. Enable a local developer experience so that I could build my analytical backends right alongside my Frontend (in my office, in the desert, or on plane)\n3. Leverage data validation standards— like types and validation libraries such as pydantic or typia—to enforce data quality controls and make testing easy\n4. Build in support for the best possible analytical infra while keeping things extensible to incrementally support legacy and emerging analytical stacks\n5. Support the same languages we use to build transactional apps. I started with Python and TypeScript but I plan to expand to others\n\nThe framework is still in beta and it’s now used by teams at big and small companies to build analytical backends. I’d love some feedback from this community\n\nYou can take it for a spin by starting from a boilerplate starter project:[ https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart)\n\nOr you can start from a pre-built project template for a more realistic example:[ https://docs.fiveonefour.com/templates](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/templates)",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I have this idea for a data lake/data warehouse architecture for my startup that I've come to based on a few problems I've experienced, I'd like to hear this subreddits' thoughts.\n\nThe start up I work for has been dancing around product-market fit for several years, but hasn't quite nailed it. We though we had it in 2020 but then zero-interest rate ended, then AI, and now we're back to the drawing board. The mandate from leadership has been to re-imagine what our product can be. This means lots of change and we need to be highly nimble.\n\nToday, I follow an ELT approach. I use a combination of 3rd party ingestion tools+custom jobs to load data, then dbt to build assets (tables/views) in BigQuery that I make available to various stakeholders. My transformation pipeline looks like the following:\n\n1. staging - light transformations and 1:1 with raw source tables\n2. intermediate - source data integrated/conformed/cleansed\n3. presentation - final clean pre-joined,pre-aggregated data loosely resembling a Kimball-style star schema\n\nStaging and intermediate layers are part of a transformation step and often change, are deleted, or otherwise break as I refactor to support the presentation layer.\n\n[Current architecture which provides either 1 type of guarantee or no guarantee](https://preview.redd.it/lw8za6s3ggye1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=e36ac4259058bcce5ae72fbdef1e8bb7ec2e2eb5)\n\nThis approach has worked to a degree. I serve a large variety of use cases and have limited data quality issues, enough that my org has started to form a team around me. But, it has created several problems that have been exacerbated by this new agility mandate from leadership:\n\n1. As a team of one and growing, it takes me too long to integrate new data into the presentation layer. This results in an inability for me to make data available fast enough to everyone who needs it, which leads to shadow and/or manual data efforts by my stakeholders\n2. To avoid the above I often resort to granting access to staging and intermediate layer data so that teams are unblocked. However, I often need to refactor staging/intermediate layers to appropriately support changes to the presentation layer. These refactors introduce breaking changes which creates issues/bugs in dependent workflows/dashboards. I've been disciplined about communicating to stakeholders about the risks involved, but it happens often.\n3. Lots of teams want a dev version of data so they can create proof-of-concepts, and develop on my data. However many of our source systems have dev/prod environments that don't integrate in the same way. ex. join keys between 2 systems' data that work in prod are not available in dev, so the highly integrated nature of the presentation layer makes it impossible to produce exact replicas of dev and prod.\n\nTo solve these problems I've been considering am architectural solution that I think makes sense for a fast-moving startup... I'm proposing we break the data assets into 2 categories of data contract...\n\n1. **source-dependent**. These assets would be fast to create and make available. They are merely a replica of the data in the source system with a thin layer of abstraction (likely a single dbt model) with guarantees against changes by me/my team, but would not provide guarantees against irreconcilable changes in the source system (ie. if the source system is removed). These would also have basic documentation and metadata for discoverability. They would be similar to the staging layer in my old architecture, but rather than being an unstable step in a transformation pipeline, where refactors introduce breaking, they are standalone assets. These would also provide the ability to create dev and prod version since they are not deeply integrated with other sources. ex. \\`salesforce\\_\\_opportunities\\` all opportunities from salesforce. As long as the opportunity object in Salesforce exists, and we continue to use Salesforce as our CRM, the model will be stable/dependable.\n2. **source-agnostic**. The assets would be the same as the presentation layer I have today. They would be a more complex abstraction of multiple source systems, and provide guarantees against underlying changes to source systems. We would be judicious about where and when we create these. ex. \\`opportunities\\`. As long as our business cares about opportunities/deals etc. no matter if we change CRM's or the same CRM changes their contract, this will be stable/dependable\n\n[Proposed architecture which breaks assets into 2 types with different guarantees](https://preview.redd.it/mqt2ojo7ggye1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=070c5524998a56569b96fda3201a4567489cd89d)\n\nThe hope is that source-dependent assets can be used to unblock new data use cases quickly with a reasonable level of stability, and source-agnostic assets can be used to support critical/frequented data use-cases with a high level of stability.\n\nSpecifically I'm curious about:\n\n1. General thoughts on this approach. Risks/warnings/vibe-check.\n2. Other ways to do this I should consider. It's hard to find good resources on how to deliver stable data assets/products at a fast-moving startup with limited data resourcing. Most of the literature seems focused on data for large enterprises",

All my*scriptsl* were using Faker but always extended with some additional usecase. This is how I ended up writing [glassgen](https://pypi.org/project/glassgen/). It generates synthetic data, sends it to a sink and is simply configured by a json config.

        "content": "Hello\n\nI need a sanity check.\n\nI am educated and work in an unrelated field to DE. My IT experience comes from a pure layman interest in the subject where I have spent some time dabbing in python building scrapers, setting up RDBs, building scripts to connect everything and then building extraction scripts to do analysis. Ive done some scripting at work to automate annoying tasks. That said, I still consider myself a beginner.\n\nAt my workplace we are a bunch of consultants doing work mostly in excel, where we get lab data from external vendors. This lab data is then to be used in spatial analysis and comparison against regulatory limits. \n\nI have now identified 3-5 different ways this data is delivered to us, i.e. ways it could be ingested to a central DB. Its a combination of APIs, emails attachments, instrument readings, GPS outputs and more. Thus, Im going to try to get a very basic ETL pipeline going for at least one of these delivery points which is the easiest, an API.\n\nBecause of the way our company has chosen to operate, because we dont really have a fuckton of data and the data we have can be managed in separate folders based on project/work, we have servers on premise. We also have some beefy computers used for computations in a server room. So i could easily set up more computers to have scripts running. \n\nMy plan is to get a old computer up and running 24/7 in one of the racks. This computer will host docker+dagster connected to a postgres db. When this is set up il spend time building automated extraction scripts based on workplace needs. I chose dagster here because it seems to be free in our usecase, modular enought that i can work on one job at a time and its python friendly. Dagster also makes it possible for me to write loads to endpoint users who are not interested in writing sql against the db.  Another important thing with the db on premise is that its going to be connected to GIS software, and i dont want to build a bunch of scripts to extract from it.\n\nSome of the questions i have:\n\n* If i run docker and dagster (dagster web service?) setup locally, could that cause any security issues? Its my understanding that if these are run locally they are contained within the network\n* For a small ETL pipeline like this, is the setup worth it? \n* Am i missing anything?\n\n",

Basically, it allows developers to use R2 object storage (which is S3 compatible) as a data lakehouse using Apache Iceberg. It already supports Spark (scala and pyspark), Snowflake and PyIceberg. For now, we have to run the query processing engines outside Cloudflare. [https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/)\n\nI find this exciting because it makes easy for beginners like me to get started with data engineering. I remember how much time I have spent while configuring EMR clusters while keeping an eye on my wallet. I found myself more concerned about my wallet rather than actually getting my hands dirty with data engineering. The whole product line focuses on actually building something and not spending endless hours in configuring the services.\n\nCurrently, Cloudflare has the following products which I think are useful for any data engineering project.\n\n1.

I'm only really familiar with a handful of these platforms but even just selecting a column I normally have to go and dig up it's data type from some other interface, let alone getting any of the engineers' documentation on it.\n\nSnowflake for instance allows us to create `comments` pinned to tables, views, schemas , columns. The lot basically. Why are these comments so hidden to our users whilst they're actually writing the queries that make use of these tables, columns, etc?\n\nOur team goes to a decent amount of effort to build useful and readable documentation around each table but is it any use if the end users have to pull up the docs in a separate tab before they understand that they're using the wrong column for their joins?\n\nThis feels like something that's not too hard to implement, I know having objects tagged with a comment or description is already a nice to have in the data world but surely we can do better? Please tell me that I've just been unlucky and most solutions do this cleanly out of the box. Is there a platform or at least some DBM software out there that's doing this that I'm just unaware of?",

        "content": "Hello dear people! Been dealing with this very interesting problem that I'm not 100% sure how to tackle. A local forum went down some time ago and they lost a few hours worth of data since backups aren't hourly. Quite a few topics were lost, as well as some of them apparently became corrupted and also got lost. One of them included a very nice discussion about local mountaineering and beautiful locations which a lot of people are saddened to lost since we discussed many trails. Somehow, people managed to collect data from various cached sources, computers, some screenshots, but mostly old google, bing caches while they worked and webarchive. \n\nNow it's all properly ordered in pdf document but the thing is the layouts often change and so does resolution but the general idea of how data is represented is the same. There's also some artifacts in data from webarchive for example - they have an element hovering over text and you can't see it, but if you ctrl-f to search for it it's there somehow, hidden under the image haha. No javascript in PDF, something else, probably  colored, no idea.\n\nThe ideas I had were (btw PDF is OCR'd already):\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- PDF to text and try to regex + LLM process it all somehow?\n\n- Somehow \"train\" (if train is a proper word here?) machine vision / machine learning for each separate layout so that it knows how to extract data\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut I also face issue that some posts are for example screenshoted in \"half\", e.g. page 360 has the text cut out and continue on page 361 with random stuff on top from the archival's page (e.g. webarchive or bing cache info). I would need to also truncate this, but that should be easy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Or option 3 with those new LLMs that can somehow recognize images or work with PDF (idk how they do it) I could maybe have the LLM do the whole heavy load of processing? I could pick up one of better new models with big context length and remembrance, I just checked total character count, it's 8.588.362 characters or 2.147.090 tokens approximately, but I believe the data could be split and later manually combined or something? I'm not sure I'm really new to this. The main goal is to have a nice json output with all data properly curated.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMany thanks! Much appreciated.",

Getting into law school in Canada is really competitive, so as a backup plan, I’m considering starting an additional degree in data science in case law school doesn’t work out. My previous degree was almost completely free due to scholarships, and since I’m in the process of joining the military I can get a second degree subsidized.   \n\nI already have a BA, so I would like to use elective credits from my previous degree toward a BSc if that’s the route I take. The only issue is that a lot of Canadian universities don’t allow you to transfer credits from previously earned degrees. Because of this, I’ve been looking into less prestigious but equally accredited school options. \n\nMy concerns are mostly about co-op opportunities, networking, and how much school reputation influences your earning potential and career growth in this field. I know that law is pretty much a meritocracy in Canada, but the alumni connections made through your university can mean the difference between tens of thousands of dollars per year. \n\nIdeally, I want to go to a school that has strong co-op programs to gain experience, and would potentially want to do an honours thesis or project. I’ve spoken to some people in CS and they’ve recommended I just do a CE boot camp, or take a few coding classes at a community college and then pursue a MS in data science. I don’t like either of these suggestions because I feel that I wouldn’t have as strong a theoretical background as someone who completed a 4 year undergrad degree. \n\nAny insight would be really helpful!

        "author": "YerayR14",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently based in Spain, so while the job market isn’t great, it’s not as tough as in the US. A few months ago, during my final year of Computer Engineering, I realized I’m genuinely passionate about the data field, especially Data Engineering and Analytics. Since then, I’ve been self-studying with the goal of starting as a Data Analyst and eventually becoming a Data Engineer.\n\nSince January, I’ve been doing an internship at a large consulting firm (180K+ employees worldwide). Initially, they didn’t give much detail about the technologies I’d be working with, but I had no other offers, so I accepted. It turned out to involve Adelia Studio, CGS, AS400, and some COBOL, technologies unrelated to my long-term goals.\n\nThese teams usually train interns in legacy systems, hoping some will stay even if it’s not what they want. But I’ve been clear about my direction and decided to take the risk. I spoke with my manager about possibly switching to a more aligned project. Some might have accepted the initial path and tried to pivot later, but I didn’t want to begin my career in a role I have zero interest in.\n\nLuckily, he understood my situation and said he’d look into possible alternatives. One of the main reasons they’re open to the change is because of my attitude and soft skills. They see genuine interest and initiative in me. That said, the feedback I’ve received on my technical performance has also been very positive. As he told me: *“We can teach someone any tech stack in the long term, but if they can’t communicate properly, they’ll be difficult to work with.”* Just a reminder that soft skills are as important as hard skills. It doesn’t matter how technically good you are if you can’t collaborate or communicate effectively with your team and clients.\n\nThankfully, I’ve been given the chance to switch to a new project working with Murex, a widely used platform in the banking sector for trading, risk, and financial reporting. I’ll be working with technologies like Python, PL/SQL (Oracle), Shell scripting, Jira... while gaining exposure to automated testing, data pipelines, and financial data processing.\n\nHowever, while this project does involve some database work and scripting, it will largely revolve around working directly with the Murex platform, which isn’t strongly aligned with my long-term goal of becoming a Data Engineer. That’s why I still have some doubts. I know that Murex itself has very little correlation with that career path, but some of the tasks I’ll be doing, such as data validation, automation, and working with databases, could still help me build relevant experience.\n\nSo overall, I see it as a better option than my previous assignment, since it brings me closer to the kind of work I want to do, even if it’s not with the most typical tools in the data ecosystem. I’d be really interested to hear what others think. Do you see value in gaining experience through a Murex-based project if your long-term goal is to become a Data Engineer? Any thoughts or advice are more than welcome.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that I was told there may be opportunities to move to a more data-focused team in the future. Of course I would need to prove my skills whether through performance, projects, technical tests or completing a master’s program related to the field.\n\nThanks to anyone who took the time to read through this and offer any kind of feedback or advice. I genuinely appreciate it. Have a good day.",

        "content": "Hello folks, I recently joined a research center with a mission to manage data generated from our many labs. This is my first time building data infrastructure, I'm eager to learn from you in the industry.\n\nWe deal with a variety of data. Time-series from sensor data log, graph data from knowledge graph, and vector data from literature embedding. We also have relational data coming from characterization. Right now, each lab manages their own data, they are all saved as Excel for csv files in disperse places.\n\nFrom initial discussion, we think that we should do the following:\n\nA. Find databases to house the lab operational data.\n\nB. Implement a data lake to centralize all the data from different labs\n\nC. Turn all relational data to documents (JSON), as schema might evolve and we don't really do heave analytics or reporting, AI/ML modelling is more of the focus.\n\nIf you have any comments on the above points, they will be much appreciated.\n\nI also have a question in mind:\n\n1. For databases, is it better to find specific database for each type of data (neo4j for graph, Chroma for vector...etc), or we would be better of with a general purpose database (e.g. Cassandra) that houses all types of data to simplify managing processes but to lose specific computing capacity for each data type(for example, Cassandra can't do graph traversal)?\n2. Cloud infrastructure seems to be the trend, but we have our own data center so we need to leverage it. Is it possible to use the managed solution from Cloud provides (Azure, AWS, we don't have a preference yet) and still work with our own storage and compute on-prem?\n\nThank you for reading, would love to hear from you.",

Especially if you're dealing with datasets or anything that needs to be portable and well-documented.\n\nSo my question is: why don't we talk about them more here? Is it just too \"dataset\" focused? Too old-school? Or am I missing something about why they aren't more widely used in modern data workflows?\n\nCurious if anyone here has actually used them in production or has thoughts on where they do/don't fit in today's stack.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,\n\nWe have a source system that is only able to export data using a \"start\" and \"end\" date range. So for example, each day, we get a \"current month\" export for the data falling between the start of the month and the current day. We also get a \"prior month\" report each day of the data from the full prior month. Finally, we also may get a \"year to date\" file with all of the data from the start of the year to current date.\n\nNothing in the data export itself gives us an \"as of date\" for the record (the source system uses proprietary information to give us the data that \"falls\" within that range). All we have is the date range for the individual export to go off of.\n\nI'm struggling to figure out how to model this data. Do I simply use three different \"fact\" models? One each for \"daily\" (sourced from the current month file), \"monthly\" (sourced from the prior month file), and \"yearly\" (sourced from the year to date file)? If I do that, how do I handle the different grains for the SCD Type 2 DIM table of the data? What should the VALID\\_FROM/VALID\\_TO columns be sourced from in this case? The daily makes sense (I would source VALID\\_FROM/VALID\\_TO from the \"end\" date of the data extract that keeps bumping out each day), but I don't know how that fits into the monthly or yearly data.\n\n  \nAny insight or help on this would be really appreciated.\n\nThank you!!",

The problem we have rn is that our older cluster version is very old (19.x.x), and our team could not update it for the past few years. After trying to upgrade the cluster gracefully, we have decided to go against it, and deploy a new cluster, sync the data between these two and then retire the old one. Both clusters are only getting inserts by a set of similar kafka engine tables that are inserting new data into materialized views that populate the inner tables. But the inner table schemas have changed a bit.\n\n  \nI tried clickhouse-backup, but the issue is that the database/metadata have changed, the definition of our tables, zookeeper paths and etc (our previous config had faults). For this issue, we could not also use clickhouse-copier.\n\n  \nI'm currently thinking of writing an ELT pipeline, that reads that from our source clickhouse and writes it to our destination one with some changes. I tried looking up AirByte and DLT, but the guides are mostly about using clickhouse as a sink, not a source.  \n  \nThere is also the option of writing the data to kafka, and consume it on the target cluster from kafka, but I could not find a way to do a full kafka dump using clickhouse. The problem of clickhouse being the sink in most tools/guides is also apparent here\n\nCan anybody help me out? It's been pretty cumbersome as of now.",

I think that would be much more efficient and faster since I plan to go with batch processing too.  \n2-I don't think the operations I am doing are complicated, but they will be time consuming so I want to do concurrent batch processing. I felt that using job queues would be unneeded and I can go with simpler multi threading/processing for each batch of files. Is there design pattern or architecture that could work well with this?\n\nI already built an Object-Oriented code but I want to optimize things and also make it less complicated as I feel that my current code looks too messy for the job, which is definitely in part due to my inexperience in such use cases.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a junior Computer Science student who transferred after completing one year at a local community college. I was super excited to transfer just one hour away because the program has project-based classes, and that was exactly what I was looking for. After a tough and competitive admission process, I was finally able to get into the program. It felt like a huge achievement, especially given how competitive it was.\n\nLast fall semester, I was given a project that was honestly much harder than anything I had worked on before. I started experiencing a lot of imposter syndrome, and to make things worse, I realized I really struggle with public speaking—something that became a big challenge during group presentations. Even though it was tough, I stuck with it as much as I could until the final weeks of the semester. But then, I completely panicked and ended up skipping the final presentation, ignoring both my teammates and professors.\n\nAs a result, I ended up failing the course and got kicked out of the CS program. Now, I’m back at home, feeling completely stuck and unsure what to do next. I can’t help but regret the way I handled everything, especially the missed opportunity. I know I let my fear and lack of confidence get the best of me, but I don’t know how to move forward.\n\nI guess I’m asking for advice from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or just has some perspective on what my next steps should be. How do I rebuild my confidence and get back on track ",

Don’t just write code for 5 hours and spend a whole hour testing it.\n\n\\- Printing the output makes it so you can identify whats going on in the program at that moment and can help identify where the problem lies.\n\n\\- Using a piece of paper to go through what should be happening, what is actually happening, and what my ideas are. For example if I have a function that’s supposed to take the factorial of a number, on paper I’ll write down how if there’s an input of 6, it should multiply 1 by 6 then go into a 2nd recursion layer to multiply 6 by 5, and so on. Then I’ll write down according to my code, what is actually happening.\n\nAny other tricks for debugging you know about?",

It also has a debugging tool which i still struggle to use though. \n\nThis week i started learning html and started using VS Code. So far so good, but i will admit the autocomplete function is kinda rubbing me the wrong way. It feels fantastic in the moment that i dont have to completely type it all out and that when closing a starting element off it will auto add the closing element, \neg <section>section details</section >\n\nBut damn im not gonna lie, i can see how this could make me lazy. Sure its productive and a cool functionality. But... I just cant shake the feeling that it might not be good (esp as a beginner).

Basically, I know a decent amount about algorthims. The problem I found was, nothing I made was particularly useful. Sure it's nice to have a program that can calculate the height of a planet, or a program that can calculate how many of Bessy's friends need painkillers, but none of it is particularly useful for stuff like say getting a job. In addition, the problem with these algorithms is they're pretty small projects. If I decide to make coding a job, I need to start making bigger projects, and also I just want to make a bigger project than just poker from the terminal.\n\nI've always wanted to make a game, mainly because I really like video games. And, I feel like making a game would count as a big project. The problem is, I uh have no clue where to start. I know python and can pretty easily learn another language if I need to but I'm kind of lost. Any advice or tips on how to get started?",

I can create a static page using HTML and CSS, and I can add a bit of interactivity with JavaScript and understand it somewhat. Of course, I’m not capable of building a large application yet, but I understand a lot more than when I first started.\nLately, I’ve been feeling insecure and anxious, wondering if maybe it’s already too late for me to pursue this. When I look for junior jobs, there seem to be literally none.\nI really enjoy the fact that I can see what I create — like building a page, an accordion, a navigation bar, or dynamically hiding or adding something. Being able to actually see what I make is something I love.\nMy plan B would be to quickly take some fiber optics classes and move towards networking, but I don’t think it would take me as far.\nIs it already too late for me to get into web development? 33yr old btw ;(\n",

This course on youtube by freecodecamp that covers all of DSA on Python.   \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA&t=54s&ab\\_channel=freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA&t=54s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)  \nTheres also this one which is more general   \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0&ab\\_channel=freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)  \nand also a playlist on youtube by Greg Hogg on DSA. Also another resource on DSA was a course on udemy by Eishad Karimov. So. there are a lot of options on DSA, excited to learn all this.\n\nAfter that or while doing the DSA course I plan on completing, leetcode questions, this practice section on geeksforgeeks  \n [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions&itm\\_source=geeksforgeeks&itm\\_medium=main\\_header&itm\\_campaign=practice\\_header](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions&itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=main_header&itm_campaign=practice_header)  \nand this course by neetcode offering on freecodecamp which is the top 150 asked questions for interviewers?  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0u5nwSA0w0&ab\\_channel=freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0u5nwSA0w0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)\n\nThe problem that I am facing right now is that all this is for data science and ai I believe that Python is for, and I can use frameworks? I don't really understand it all very well. But my end goal is to create applications that can help give me streams of income. I understand what you will say that coding shouldn't be about the money, but I am genuinely interested in learning all the crevices of this large iceberg. I picked this route because it seemed to be a good starting point with a good roadmap. But as I started to go deeper there was just so much information that I really don't even know where to begin. Learned something about SQL, Flask, Tailwind CSS?   \n  \nThe source of inspiration for all this was this video by stoneycodes  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvO88XxNAzs&ab\\_channel=stoneycodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvO88XxNAzs&ab_channel=stoneycodes)  \nAnyway is this a good starting point? Like I said the end goal is to be able to create apps that I believe will make peoples lives easier. I've loving programming for a couple years now but a recent epiphany made me realize that if you want something you gotta go get it! Stop waiting for it. create your own luck if you want to say. Currently the python course by jose padilla, is frying my brain, the practice problems make my brain stop working. I don't know.. Some advice is appreciated it you're willing to share. Thank you have a blessed day! \n\n  \nP.S \n\nsorry for spelling errors :o",

Keep in mind that my degree is nowhere near to CS or anything IT related.\n\nMeanwhile I can say I’m so happy to have found my passion for programming I want also to  pursue this path, no matter how hard it is. \nYes, the job market sucks. \nYes, I don’t have a degree. \nBUT, I really want to make it because I understood, after months of self sabotaging, that this is what I want from my life.\nAnd no, I’m not here for the money since I was already mentally prepared for economic uncertainties given my degree in linguistics.\n\nBut now I would like to ask you, what should I do? What’s the best option to break in the industry? These are my options:\n\n1.\t⁠⁠bootcamps: hella expensive, are they enough to provide credibility?\n2.\t⁠⁠going fully self taught: basically no credibility unless you’re born with the same IQ as Bill gates, and super hard.\n3.\t⁠⁠a coding academy: I found few coding academies in Europe that prepare you for 2-3 years and provide you some internships. They are partners of the global 42 network. Are they good? Apparently they’re very hard but I’m in for the ride\n4.\t⁠⁠online university: since I probably already trashed my parents’ money on a degree I would like this time to be responsible and pay for my own education and the only way I could do it is by getting a CS degree but online.\n\nGiven that I’d love to hear all your opinions, all these things which are already well known about the market being shit are not so relevant to me. I don’t care how long it takes I want to make it, but these are my best assets.",

        "author": "Tough_Trust5713",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "The prior post about this provider of bootcamps has been archived by Reddit and doesn't allow to post comments, and the only allowed comment isn't genuine in my view:\n\n  \nI believe the DfE should initiate an investigation into the Software Development online bootcamp by this provider that they fully subsidise, to ensure accountability and protect future participants from what I deem unprofessional and childish behavior by its leads.\n\nBelow, I outline my key concerns:\n\n1) **Misleading duration.** The bootcamp was advertised on the Academy website as a 16-week training program to qualify participants as full-stack software developers, and when I enrolled I confirmed I agreed to 16 weeks. However, when I asked for proof of studies letter, the founder informed me via email that the duration was only 12 weeks, undermining the program’s promised scope and depth. I believe that shortening the DeF-agreed programme undermines the DfE’s expectation of transparency and value for money, and might reduce its effectiveness.\n\n2) **Misleading capacity.** The program was promoted as limited to 10 students, ensuring a 1:10 instructor-to-student ratio for personalized learning, including 1:1 office hours during lunch breaks, as described in the enrollment interview. Yet, an email from the administrator was sent to 24 students, significantly exceeding the advertised capacity and diluting the quality of instruction. This is concerning because Skills Bootcamps under the NSF must provide \"intensive, focused training to ensure participants gain employable skills\", and overcrowding can compromise this.\n\n3) **Breach of DPA.** The administrator failed to use Bcc in group emails, publicly disclosing the personal contact details of all participants without consent. This violates the data protection standards outlined by the DfE, which emphasize the need to protect personal data and respond effectively to breaches. Additionally, not offering an option to use an alternative email for Teams access further exacerbates the privacy breach, as it forces participants to expose private email addresses, violating GDPR’s requirement for informed consent, and the NSF expected compliance with DPA standards to ensure participant trust and safety.\n\n4) **Lack of planning and transparency**. Despite repeated requests, neither the founder nor the administrator provided a provisional timetable detailing the breakdown of hours for technical and soft skills training. Furthermore, the founder claimed daily sessions would start at 9:00 AM, but Teams instructions indicated 9:30 AM, with no clarity on end times or offline breaks, hindering effective preparation. This again infringes the DfE requirement for funded training to operate transparently, while poor planning could be seen as a failure to deliver the agreed provision effectively.\n\n5) **Unreasonable funder's behavior**. **One hour before the bootcamp’s start, I was removed from the program and blocked from accessing the academy’s Slack and Teams platforms. This decision was based on a trivial matter: the change of my 3mm Slack thumbnail picture the night before, which was deemed “unflattering” to the interviewer despite being a tiny, totally unrecognizable image.** This action demonstrates a lack of professionalism, fairness, and equitable access. Given that the DfE expects funded programs to ensure equitable access to education for eligible participants, the unreasonable removal could be seen as a failure to deliver the program.\n\n6) **Lack of empathy**. I explained to the founder and administrator that I had made significant financial and physical sacrifices to attend, including relocating to a new residence to ensure a suitable remote working environment. Despite these efforts, they refused to reinstate me, showing disregard for the challenges faced by participants, the public resources invested, and the support provided by others, such as my landlady, whose assistance was ultimately wasted. \n\n7) **Possible systematic waste of public funding received by the DfE.** Upon joining the academy’s Slack account, I noticed a “General” channel where instructors posted notes and recordings of the first lesson for the prior cohort, but engagement in that channel ended abruptly. This suggests the possibility of early termination of the bootcamp in the past. Additionally, the lack of transparency in participant identities on Slack, combined with the ease of removing participants, raises concerns: the program could misrepresent its impact by attributing employment outcomes to others who are not their students but find employment as developers.\n\n8) **Poor communication.** Essential details, such as session start times and access links, were buried in irrelevant information within login emails, raising questions about their fitness for role.\n\n9) **Gender Bias.** During the enrollment interview, I mentioned a podcast highlighting that women often end up in front-end development roles, which are less paid and more tedious than back-end roles dominated by men. The interviewer responded by stating that, in her view, this is because women are less capable in mathematics than men.  This bias contradicts the principles of equality and meritocracy in the tech industry and raises concerns about their inclusivity, especially given the DfE’s awareness of gender imbalances in Skills Bootcamps.\n\n",

I am so pleased but I really did go in knowing almost nothing at all.\n\nI’ve now been at the company as a front end developer for 1.5 years and I can now complete my tasks mostly independently. However I still constantly feel like I don’t really know what I’m doing. I worry that I’ve just got good at doing the specifics in my company but if I were to move somewhere else I’d basically be brand new again. \n\nFor the first year I was doing a lot of learning and continuing learning in the evenings with my own projects. However for the last 6 months I’ve felt like I’ve got to a point where my brain feels so full I cannot take anything more in and I feel I haven’t really improved. \n\nThere are still so many things at work that I don’t understand. In the last couple of weeks been asked to help out on another project which is much bigger than I am used to and getting my head around the code, all the components and types and where everything is being imported from and the structure of it all feels overwhelming. There’s so many custom hooks and so many components. I am managing tasks but requiring more help than I’d like. \n\nOn one hand I do feel pleased that I’ve got to a point where I can do this job, as my bootcamp was really nowhere near the minimum required to function in my role. However I’m worried that I’m lagging behind and my progress has stalled. I see some people come in new and they seem to have picked up a lot more than me in their first year. \n\n- I wonder if it’s partly my age. I’m a career changer in my 30s with a toddler and I really think I’ve lost the ability to learn as quickly as I once did. It’s not that I believe I am incapable of learning new things but perhaps I should accept it might take longer. \n\n- I wonder if it’s also that I have a lot of gaps in my knowledge as I don’t have the basic foundational understanding of computer science that a lot of my colleagues with CS degrees are coming in with. Would it be worth doing specifically some CS courses do you think? \n\nIs there any advice for this “head too full” feeling where I feel I can’t take anymore in? It’s been going on for months now and it’s like my brain is always so tired even though I’ve not really been learning a lot recently. \n\nThank you in advance. ",

Most if not all of my classmate already know how to code, most of them are in this program for the  scholarship or opportunity of going outside the country to study and apply for a job. And theirs me, someone who was using Mimo coding app to learn about programming last year and can only use html to write(hello world, how is your day going) and people who are using html to code an entire website. I digress, we started vocode and how teacher that taught us how to code with the programming language but didn't go into it, and the following week put us in groups of 6 for a project, for us to pick out of 6 subject and make a website out of it. Which shock me because we just started and I'm still railing in the fact that I am not even good at any language even html which I started doing online last year and now we are to build a website. The others weren't conflicted like I was. And it was then I learnt almost all of them already know how to code so to them this was not difficult, but to me it was I was nothing in this class. I saw the guy who was in our group the following day and what he did with the vscode shock me because, line's upon line's  of code done in a single day, each page on the vscode I could  not understand. He proposed he will handle the website will the rest of us handle how will present it, which fill my heart with grace because if I was called to contribute anything to creation of the website, I will have nothing to say. Other groups to, their where people who were coding like it was nothing and it ashamed me, it made me feel like I was retarded.  I use to tell my self I will design games or build software and get a job as a programmer and now I know nothing and it feels insulting. Anyway we showed our result and we good. And 2 weeks ago we started java, If I have to say it easy, I followed well, coding was easing with java on intellija and it was a boost on my confidence that I was following and understanding with this time I believe I was with the class. Then came yesterday, we did a solar planet code with just the shape, distance to the sun and if lifeexist. Now we are told to perform the program will all the properties of all 8 planet. This type of assignment are to test ourselves put how will I do it and the with java. That is the problem, am I cut out for this. Should I just us AI, I don't know there are still more courses if I'm falling at this what about the rest  ",

I don’t know if I’m super lucky but… CS has been a good and easy field for me.\n\nI have graduated from an average european engineering school. Did a three year apprenticeship in an average company. Moved to Switzerland and tripled my salary. A couple years later changed company and I’m almost at 160k fixed salary.\n\nAll that and… I’m not a super good developer. Honestly, compared to my peers I would say I’m slightly (very slightly) above average. I never did leetcode. I havent read a CS book in the last 10 years. I don’t keep up with new technologies (I’m a Java dev and I dont know what’s the latest version).\n\nBut hey, looking back on my career, I do think I have a few positive points that made me get here :\n\n- I have more social skills than 90% of my dev colleagues. Yes this in an stereotype. Some of the best developers I met are completely autistic. These guys can’t hold a normal conversation for 5 minutes. Let alone when there’s a woman in the conv\n\n- Learn languages. I’m one of the only ones on my team who can write in english correctly and speak without a heavy accent. I have been put in so many meetings just because I spoke english. Languages really open doors.\n\n- I never refused work. Whenever my boss asks me to do some menial, non-interesting, boring task… I just do it. When someone needs to do it, I volunteer for it. Really, it’s that simple, even if the task is dumb\n\n- When someone asks you do somethint, always ask for a ticket or an email. You’re not a decision taker, you’re a developer. This will get you out of trouble.\n\n- Be friends with people from other  : have a DBA friend, have a DevOps friend, have a Sec engineer friend. You’ll need them. \n\nThat’s it guys. It’s plain, simple and everyone can do it but most people won’t do it\n\n\n",

The team claims they messed up but that the docusign they sent over after had it marked as hybrid so I need to come into the office two days a week and that they don't have room in the profit model to afford to comp parking.

I graduated in the fall semester of 2014 and have been working as a developer for 7 and a manager for the last 4 years.\n\nRecently I began applying for jobs as an engineering manager. I have to say it’s been though in our side as well. While the amount of call backs I get is very high the amount of jobs for this level are also very low. \n\nI have applied to a mixture of companies from Fortune 50, to Fortune 500 in all sectors from Fintech to healthcare.\n\nI have had maybe 32 conversations with recruiters. I have a very specific requirement. I do not want to manage an overseas team especially if I have to go the office 5 days a week to do it.\n\nOut of those 32 conversations only one company Capital One had me managing developers in the USA. Every single other company was in India EVERY single other company. Sometimes I would get a mix where there would be 2-8 US devs just doing high level architecture design then handing the work over.\n\nI thought about the Capital One job and I reached out to a contact at there and he told me pretty much the whole team was basically here on H1B visas including the other engineering managers. I’ve been around long enough to know how bad monoculture work environments are especially with H1B’s AND stack ranking so I declined that job as well.\n\nI have to be honest with you guys. I am going to need a job soon. I have been trying my best not to contribute to this outsourcing mess especially when it’s denying opportunities to people like me who came from bad social economic backgrounds and a no name school and was blessed to get a junior role where I could grow.\n\nI been reaching out to my network and it’s the same everywhere. Whole teams are getting replaced. I have friends that used to work normal hours waking up in the middle of the night to jump into sprint planning meetings. I got people crying and hugging their employees as their entire in office team is laid off then they have to drive into the office everyday just to hop on zoom calls with people in Argentina.\n\nIf we don’t get some legislative solutions for this I think our sector is going to go the way of manufacturing. You are going to be telling your kids about how you used to work a tech job right out of college for a good wage.",

There’s a weird idea floating around that these senior developers and tech leads are born with some genetic advancement that makes their brains better at coding. I highly doubt that. I think they’ve just had years of experience. \n\nSoftware development is learned over time, it’s not something you’re just born good at. If this were basketball, ok this guys born with genetics that make him 7 feet tall. If this were football, ok this kid was born to be 260 pounds at 16 years old. But software development? That’s like… just being exposed too and practicing a tech stack repeatedly.\n\nIf your new grad is failing or not getting hired, let’s exclude new grads who genuinely just don’t want to be software developers or can’t work in an environment without freaking out and punching someone. They’re not who I’m talking about. \n\nSince the bare minimum requirement to even have a seed to grow into a good developer is the ability to break down complex problems, patience, persistence, and willingness to learn, I think the vast majority of people can grow into good developers. But people need structure, exposure, and practice with a consistent stack before you make judgement calls on their overall lifetime ability to excel in technology.\n\nBasically, I’m babbling, but new grads who want to be software developers being incompetent isn’t the problem here. I think it’s more likely just market demand, lack of onboarding structure and documentation, unreasonable expectations for a new graduate skill level.",

I provided him a detailed explanation of the flow and even pointed out how very similar bugs in the past have been fixed (the same solution as the one liner). I basically gave him everything he needed except for straight up telling him exactly what line to change. \n\nHe's been working on this ticket for 4 days now.\n\nAt what point do I step in and just tell him what to change? It feels like I would be kinda micromanaging him at that point but maybe I'm just looking at this wrong idk",

        "content": "SWE with 10+ years experience working for big tech. Not worried about LLMs writing code better than me—maybe that’s coming, but whatever. What I’m actually scared of is this: a lot of the SaaS world runs on CRUD apps. Dashboards, admin panels, internal tools, basic workflow platforms—99% of it is forms and tables over a database with some business logic sprinkled in.\n\nBut now we’ve got agents that can insert structured data directly from natural input (emails, PDFs, speech, whatever), and LLMs that can query and visualize that data however you want. Why bother building a UI at all? Why have a separate analytics dashboard if you can just ask for “revenue by cohort for Q2” and get a chart back?\n\nFeels like we’re heading toward a world where the core “app” isn’t a UI anymore—it’s just a schema + an agent + a model. And if that’s the future… does most CRUD work just evaporate?\n\nI know not everything can or should be replaced by this (think banking, social media etc), but I can’t shake the feeling that a lot of what we currently build is basically middleware between users and structured data—and LLMs are starting to eat that.\n\nAnyone else thinking about this? How are you adapting?",

This friend always asked help from me in classes and somehow landed a way better internship than I did, even though I applied to over 400 last year and I’m not even international. Another one of my international friends landed Amazon swe. I can’t stop feeling like I am just not technically good enough, and I can’t stop wondering what is wrong with my application. I can’t help but to feel bitter when others land something better with way fewer applications. I have asked many people to look over my resume and they all say it’s good. People say it’s luck and a numbers game, but I have applied so much already and I can’t believe it’s only because im unlucky. I have had interviews from great companies, but I always somehow manage to screw it up and get rejected. I fully acknowledge the toxicity of my mindset and I would love to divert my energy to self improvement, but I have no idea how to stop feeling this way.

I didn’t get to make any mistakes in this short tenure yet, but I imagine if I did, then he would come up with a speech about how breaking things is the way of innovation or some other nonsence. \n\nThis manager was recently promoted into his role after being an individual contributor for a long time at this company, so I imagine it’s not out of the ordinary that he still doesn’t have a hang of things. But him targeting me in particular with this makes me uneasy. Is there anything to deduce from his behavior, and if so, is there anything I can do from my side?\n\n",

Spent hours reading docs, watching tutorials, bookmarking blogs I’ll probably never open again. I knew all the theory but had nothing to show for it.\n\nThen one random weekend, I said screw it and built a tiny little site around something dumb I cared about. It didn’t follow the “perfect stack” or latest trends, but I actually finished it. And I learned more from shipping that one thing than all the hours of passive studying.\n\nNow I’m trying to shift away from “learn first, build later” to “build first, learn while doing.”\n\nAnyways, back to my question. \nHave you ever felt the same way about learning topics that you curious about, almost to the point of obsession? Do you think that it is good or bad?",

Then, they’ll list this as an internship on their see bee or LinkedIn page.\n\nInteresting, to be honest I interned at some large companies but basically did data entry and a very small amount of development work, but I of course listed it as “web developer intern using React” when React was maybe like 15% of the job, so I’m not hating on these guys.

It was never a large team to begin with, 5 developers plus my manager, managing ecommerce platforms, data, internal business applications, b2b systems, AI services, etc.\n\nLast year we lost one developer who was frustrated by the direction we were going. Her position was never filled, instead they hired a developer from India in an adjacent team, to focus on software for the warehouse. Then one developer was moved to a specific niche dealing with our internal Microsoft integrations. Now finally, another developer is being removed from my team. They carried a lot of weight because they were one of those \"say yes to everything\" work 16-hour day folks. However, now they are being completely removed from our area of the company and reassigned. I'm left with 1 other developer and he is very junior.\n\nIn 1 year, I've gone from a 5 person team to a 2 person team, and yet no expectations have been adjusted. I am being told that I should take on all the responsibilities of the developer that's now being moved, while maintaining my current responsibilities, compensating for the 2 developers that left last year who were never filled, and on top of all that with the company breathing down my neck wanting to start no less than 5 new major projects.\n\nAnd my manager is acting like everything is completely normal and seems to have no concept that this is completely impractical. I have asked for more staff for a year but it's falling on deaf ears, even when projects that were supposed to take 4 months ended up taking us close to a year. At the very least I have been asking for the opportunity to pair-program and work with some of the more senior developers that have left or are being reassigned, and yet the company cannot make time for that. There's always an excuse, some other \"more pressing issue\" that I have to focus on before training can happen.\n\nI feel like I'm being set up to fail and I have no idea how to plan for this. I am obviously looking for other jobs, but this is the worst market in a long time. I have some financial cushion, but I don't want to quit because of how the Economy is looking. That said, if I don't quit it feels like I will really quickly be backed into a corner where I am being asked to work insane hours to address even a portion of the responsibilities that are being laid on me or have to be constantly explaining why things are delayed and all blame put on my shoulders.",

I spent my first year working as a consultant and have since been working as a fullstack engineer, with a heavy focus on backend engineering.\n\nCurrently, I'm at a large tech company — maybe a step or two below FAANG — but it's a name most people would recognize. Lately, though, I've been feeling stagnant. I'm still classified as an entry-level engineer in terms of pay and title, even though I'm consistently performing at a level or two above that. (That's not just my opinion — both my manager and two technical mentors have told me this.)\n\nFor example, as a Level 1 engineer, I'm technically supposed to be mostly taking tickets, relying on senior engineers for clarification, and developing technical depth in one main language. In reality, my day-to-day work involves starting and completing projects independently, defining requirements while working with outside stakeholders, implementing new technologies into our tools, and even managing a contractor. There’s a big gap between my responsibilities and my official title.\n\nSome extra context: since joining my current role, my company has gone through two rounds of layoffs, and my team has been moved under two different organizations (so I've had two different skip-level managers). Although no one has explicitly said it, I suspect that promotions are being slowed or avoided to cut costs, especially since the current job market makes it less likely that people will leave. Promotions *have* happened elsewhere in the company, but not on my team.\n\nThat said, if I didn't enjoy my job, I would just risk it and leave. But the truth is, I actually like it. My boss is supportive, my work-life balance is solid, and the benefits are good. The only real issue is that my career growth — specifically my title and pay — feels stuck. Technically, I'm still learning and working on interesting problems, so in that sense I’m not stagnant.\n\nI'm looking for advice on what to do next. Stay patient and hope things change? Look for a new opportunity elsewhere?  Thanks!",

Though I’m hitting my 5 year mark soon and I pretty stagnant where I’m at. On that note I did make it to few final rounds at a few Trading firms in Chicago but it was a typical case of me being too junior senior if that makes sense. \n\nThere are times when I learn a bit but a major of my time is chasing and mitigating risk and compliance stuff as new tech is introduced to the firm.\n\nIts more of an infrastructure role and not much of a dev/swe role though I done some automation with python. and on occassion do things in ansible, bash and so forth. \n\nHaven’t been promoted nor had a raise in the last 2 years or so. Although each time i was close my team was realigned or got a new manager about 2-3 times. \n\nHome is LA/Southern California and would like to stay on the west coast to be near family and my girlfriend so I’m looking at Seattle & The bay area. The tech market in LA seems weird to say the least. \n\nIs it really just a matter of grinding leetcode to land a new role? I feel ike 5-8 years ago that was the case but that might not seem to be it anymore? Though I could be wrong. \n\nI am looking at applying to an MS in Applied Math which my current firm would heavily subsidize and use that to pivot though unsure if that’d be the right move though it seems like the most like plausbile. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

        "content": "I am a big proponent in that we should improve ourselves by relying on ourselves only, but after a decade of working in tech, and many more years being a student, I realize that unless you are extremely talented or lucky (or both), even just talking to a willing mentor can get you astronomically ahead in any endeavor, whether it be school or career. \n\nFor example I’ll talk about myself: I am first generation college grad in my family. My parents did not know anything about tech or software or even how you use a college degree to start a career. My pre-college education was also similarly ignorant of these things (I learned to programmed as sophomore in college!). In my Senior year in high school I took a university class and got the highest grade; it was surprisingly easy for me. Had my parents or teachers encouraged me much earlier I could have likely started college earlier even as a sophomore in high school or at least taken college classes alongside high school and gotten quite ahead when starting in university. \n\nA 2nd example, I majored in CS but nobody advised me on anything nor did I know what I had to do. I only majored in CS after a professor strongly advised me to. I had a single internship simply due to a connection with that same professor. But I didn’t know I should be studying LeetCode or applying at internships for big tech. I didn’t get my first real job until 1 year after I graduated.  So imagine if I never talked to that professor or took their advice !  One single person made an infinite positive difference in my life by just talking to them !\n\nOK, now let’s move to current day. I am mid career SWE, I write lots of code but also manage other SWEs. I want to keep advancing because I have strong options about how things should be done, and I see a lot of inefficiency in current engineering leadership. I guess you could call me Sauron if you know the analogy. I actually prefer being an IC but the amount of incompetence I observe at eng leadership drives me crazy and I feel it is my duty to course correct and help rather than just shrug my shoulders and keep my nose to the grinding wheel. \n\nFor those of you now late or end of career, what would you have advised your mid career self to be doing to get to where you are now sooner ?

I know it's tough out there.*  \n  \nHow can they make the most of these opportunities?\n\nFor example, what if the job uses a completely different tech stack than what you've worked with throughout your career, or even worse, historically the market don't want this tech stack, or if the role is different (i.e. transitioning from backend to frontend heavy fullstack), or you're not interested in the domain (i.e. insurance)?  \n  \nIf you plan to stay in this job for at least 3 years while waiting for the job market to improve (if it ever does), how can you make the most of the situation?\n\nIn my experience, becoming a domain expert and the goto person in a part of the system it's what makes you grow within an organization. However, becoming an expert requires time and effort, and both of these have an opportunity cost.\n\nSo knowing that time is finite and I can just study so much while keeping all my other adult responsibilities, should I focus on becoming an expert in this new tech stack and domain to take ownership and grow, in detriment of my original stack, knowing that my original stack is still evolving and requires ongoing study, and that I might never use this new stack again?",

For us internships are mandatory. You cannot graduate without an internship. You cant even pass to the next year without a summer internship.\n\nInternships are part of your grade. The first year internship is called Initiation Internship or Observation Internship (at least one month). The second year internship is called Technical Internship (at least 2 months). And for the Final year, its a 6 month internship that start in January (half of the academic year is just the internship no classes), called PFE ( Projet Fin Etude), which translates to End of Education Project.\n\nYou supervisor has to give you like a grade on a form supplied by the school. At the start of the academic year. You have to present what you did at the internship in front of a panel of professors. And the the final one PFE internship project is a pretty big deal. You have to defend your work/project like a thesis in front of the panel. If you fuck up, you wont graduate.\n\nNow dont get me wrong our system is utter shit in many aspects. But at-least  you usually have a pretty solid CV showing real world experience.\n\nAnd I think this applies to all our schools not just Engineering.",

I've got 15 years of experience, I'm 40, and I've been out of work for a bit after a terrible injury (an assault that left me unable to walk and suffering from PTSD) and total burnout. I've had a really tough time finding a good job. I'm frankly exhausted and not totally sure if it's just time to pivot to management, or what.\n\nI've got an offer from a solid startup -  (70 employees, obfuscated because I really don't want them to see this) with good for a good salary (220-250k?) and equity, in-office. It's not a bad commute, and I could probably do good work, but it's a JavaScript shop, even on the data platform side. The code is messy as hell. The deadlines are yesterday, according to glassdoor. Not at all my forte or favorite. They need someone to work on their data platform to make it scalable and performant. It touches AI/ML, but it's scrappy and there's lots of fires to put out.\n\nI've got another offer that's contract with **possibility** of conversion at D1sney building an observability for their streaming platform, and it's more like 170K. It's got a lot of visibility, and I'd be somewhat insulated because it's a big fucking company. I'd get to work in Scala, which is a joy and not easy to find.\n\nI'm torn. I'm getting back on the horse after a pretty bad series of uncomfortable startup experiences that ended with a lot of burnout, and the idea of going into the office every day for visibility is a lot. Hell, I'm not even sure if I want to be a software engineer.\n\nD would give me more flexibility and less pressure but it does seem like a cool project. I could pretty much take it and run with it and do some cool stuff. I'm friendly and personable.\n\nI'm just trying to get back on my feet after being out of the game for about a year. I'm not sure how ready I am to hit the ground running at a startup, and I'm not sure if it's just my lack of confidence. The flexibility of in-office when I want to be is huge, but am I daft for leaning toward contract work at a big entity with the possibility of conversion for less money, considering the reality of the grind?\n\nI don't want to burn out, but I want to make sure I'm in a good place if this contract ends. Should I get the offer from the startup? I can't really use it to leverage more from D because it's through a third party, and sanity and sustainability are my big drivers. And yeah, being able to do Scala makes me happy.\n\nThoughts?",

        "content": "Hi all,\nI just received an offer from a FAANG company in the Bay Area on a team that aligns perfectly with my long-term technical career goals. It’s a dream job.\n\nMy partner just got their dream (non-tech) offer here on the East Coast (not in a major tech hub), where we currently live and have built a great community. They could possibly find a similar role in the Bay Area, and are totally open to that. I could also potentially find a solid remote role if we stayed.\n\nWe’re trying to balance the career benefits of joining FAANG on a team I would love against staying somewhere where we’re both really happy and have roots we’ve formed over the past three years.\n\nI could use some advice on:\n\n1. How much long-term value does a FAANG role really add to your resume and career growth? Is the FAANG name and learning actually that impactful on your career? (I think it is but could use perspectives)\n\n2. Do you think the payoff could be worth uprooting our lives on the East coast? \n\n3. How many years of experience at FAANG really makes a difference on your resume and your learning? It’s easier for us to consider moving for just a few years, and then coming back East. And hoping that the FAANG experience would open up a lot of opportunities and flexibility. \n\nThank you in advance!\n",

        "content": "I've been at the same company for the last 4.25 years. The work has been very stable. Luckily it's not an industry that  gets affected much due to recent economic events. However with that said, we're only a startup and my salary is 96k CAD.\n\nIn terms of the position/job, I have literally zero complaints. I've never worried about my performance, the work itself is very chill, I get to work remote and I only do actual work for around 3-4hrs a day (usually less). The people are also incredibly nice and I truly believe I'll never meet a management team that's better than my current one. However, the pay is still pretty low, especially considering I now have over 4 years of experience. The only other con is that due to the work being so chill, I have recently felt like I've stopped learning new things. Every day it's the same CRUD operations in a different format so I feel like if I continue down this path I may end up with 6 YoE but not much talent to show for it. Don't get me wrong though, I've definitely learned a ton at my current company and how to build a system from end to end, but I don't think I can learn anymore as our use base is pretty small.\n\nSo, I've started to look around as to what's available. If I get a FAANG offer with 200k+ salary, I'd take it in a heartbeat but putting that to the side, I've slowly started getting responses from other startups and small companies with salaries ranging from 100k to 150k. This made me think, what is the minimum amount of money I'd need to leave my current situation? For example, my most recent first round interview with a company told me that they pay 120k but weirdly enough I almost felt like I'd rather stay at my 96k chill job than potentially change everything for just 24k.\n\nWhat do you guys think? If you were in my position making 96k but it's like a dream scenario in terms of WLB, bosses, etc, how much money would you need to be offered to quit? Also if it matters, I'm 28.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\nI'm a relatively new developer about to leave my first non-internship role for a significant pay increase. I currently work at a local Fortune 500 company's office making ~$85k/year, and have been here for almost a year. I've accepted an offer as an SDE-1 from one of the major tech giants for approximately double my current salary. The new offer is in the same city, so thankfully I don't have to handle moving logistics along with everything else here.\n\nI have received e-contracts that I've clicked \"sign\" on (not sure how binding these are?), and their background check is currently underway. I have *not* been introduced to my manager or gotten team match confirmation yet, but I've heard that this can often take until a week before your start date at this specific company. Technically the offer could still be rescinded, but I think that's fairly unlikely.\n\nMy start date at the new company is June 9th, and I have a pre-planned europe trip the last half of May. I'm trying to decide between three options:\n\n1. Resign now: Give my full two weeks' notice, finish cleanly, then enjoy my vacation and an additional week completely job-free before starting the new position.\n2. Resign after vacation: Return from my trip and immediately submit my resignation, giving slightly less than two weeks for documentation and handover. This approach would also eliminate any risk of the offer being rescinded while I'm already unemployed.\n3. Sandwich notice period with vacation: Resign one week before vacation, and offer to work one more week after I get back. This would give them a long time to decide what to do, and would hopefully let the background check clear before I give them notice of my departure. The downside is mostly that this would feel kind of weird to me, but maybe it's more normal than I think?\n\nWhat would be the most professional approach in this situation? Any insights from those who have navigated similar transitions would be greatly appreciated. This is the first time I've ever quit a job, so I'm a little lost and anxious here.",

So I didn't get to develop any actual skills during my 2.5 years there, and was laid off in June 2024.\n\nI've had three actual interviews since then, got to the final round for data engineer at Citi but blew it at the end, and couldn't give satisfactory answers to interview technical concepts for a similar position at Royal Carribean (the interviewers were looking at each other and laughing about my apparent ineptitude, it was humiliating), and some other non-technical position that also went nowhere. Hundreds of applications and rejections later, I'm at wit's end.\n\nI've been studying for AWS certs and learning AWS basics, I scheduled the basic Cloud Practitioner exam, since I may as well start from scratch. Should I continue down this path? Seek help from an alumni network from my alma mater, Rutgers New Brunswick? Meaninglessly applying to jobs hasn't worked obviously since I have no connections to use, and every LinkedIn recruiter I try to contact just blows me off and says to apply online and wait, etc. Or should I just try to pursue a Master's in Data Science? Apparently there are prerequisite courses that I didn't even do in undergrad so I would still have to do those before applying. One of which is Multivariate Calculus, I barely scraped by in Calc II so I don't think this would be ideal for me at all.\n\n[Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QpDO2LCQTei6gvVZqEXffpLKGbl4hVGk/view?usp=sharing)",

        "content": "In my software engineering courses in graduate school, there were frequently topics of why projects fail, and those studies had described every one of my projects to the letter. \n\nIt could be because all my employment thus far has been with consulting firms, so clients go to those when they want people they can easily unload, but I couldn't even believe that many companies could be that disorganized. \n\nMy first project I was selected for, I was supposed to be a team lead, and due to my high score on the Spring Boot interview, they made me a hiring manager, but there were no questions given to me to ask or no criteria to evaluate, and there were no projections of how many people we needed staffed.  Eventually, they found they were way over budget, they started to cut parts of the new platform little by little, and many got cut from the project and replaced with offshore even after they relocated. \n\nThe 2nd project, even after they interviewed me and told them directly that I was still rather junior level, they were expecting me to know almost everything and I had nobody on site on my team, and to get any help, I had to wait for them to be available between meetings where they had about 2 minutes to talk.  I repeated to them I never claimed to be a senior developer like they thought and eventually was released. \n\nThe 3rd project, I was on a team that had been recently split into two teams, and I asked why we needed so many people for only a couple services as it didn't seem like there'd be much to do, and they told me there was definitely going to be work to do.  After about 5 weeks, we had 2-3 people working on one user story that didn't take more than about an hour to do for one person.  My manager told me it was kind of slow, so I could use some of the time to watch Udemy videos and learn new tools while they waited for more stories to come.  Eventually, they disbanded the team because they found they didn't even need it and sent a few to other teams, and cut others including me.  The manager said she was only interested in hiring contractors from vendors, and it was apparent why. \n\n  \nSo, a few years later, every time it seemed like I'd be doing a new project to get more experience, it has all been too good to be true as they ended up being only projects that were poorly projected, disorganized, and either scrapped or switched to offshore staffing.

I've been struggling with what to do for a couple years since I wasn't able to get an internship, but obviously it's now coming to a head. That being said, this is half-rant half-looking for advice so I'd appreciate constructive feedback.\n\nI'm an upcoming new grad, but (aside from a capstone project with a startup and teaching web design), I don't have a ton of marketable SWE skills other than the fundamentals. I was not able to secure a proper internship during my school career, so my only real experience is with the startup, where I mostly helped design the database, user design, and implement some AI functionality.\n\nI picked computer science because I felt it was a good balance of security and things that I like. That being, I like tech and problem solving. I was never particularly passionate about software engineering in particular, but I do love debugging and building upon existing projects. But as I approach graduation in a few weeks and hundreds of applications (and some referrals) are now returning rejections, I'm not really sure where to do. And I have already been applying to anything vaguely tech related across the US, but not getting any callbacks, which I'm sure is an indication of my resume strength.\n\nI'm feeling lost like I'm sure a lot of other people are. I feel like I'm just losing out to the people who are far more experienced and passionate than me. The response to that would be to work on personal projects and hone my portfolio, but I'm honestly skeptical that would even work. Granted, I haven't put a ton of time into doing so yet as I've been focusing on school and work, so I don't actually know yet, but I see all these super experienced and talented people getting turned down all the time anyways so it's a bit defeating.\n\n**TL;DR:** My dilemma is this - I don't know if the best plan of action is just to bunker down and grind out personal projects while continuing to apply everywhere, or instead try to study a related field to try and break in there, which would be basically any role that appreciates a CS degree. Whether that's QA, tech support/IT, data analysis, etc., I think any of them could be engaging work for me still, but I think I would still need to specifically study one of them to get in.\n\nIf anyone is interested - [here's my anonymous resume](https://imgur.com/a/AZqRh80).

        "author": "Dp1819",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi all,\n\nNot sure if this type of post has been shared before especially since I'm no longer a student, but I’m really in need of some guidance, so I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this. I’m at a crossroads and trying to figure out: **What should I do next, and where do I go from here?** I’m not looking for an easy way out, just trying to figure out a realistic path forward to build a career.\n\nWhat I have been doing hasn't been working, and I know I need to change something. That’s why I’m here: to get feedback, suggestions, and maybe some perspective.\n\nI’ve broken this down into a few parts to make it easier to follow.\n\n* My Background\n* Why I Chose CS\n* The Big Question\n* **TL;DR**\n\n**My Background**  \nI graduated in May 2023 with a BS in Computer Science. Looking back, I wish I had taken my degree more seriously instead of coasting through it. Now I’m dealing with a lot of imposter syndrome that makes learning new things and interviewing feel even tougher. Hindsight really is 20/20.\n\nDuring undergrad, I didn’t land any internships—largely due to my own lack of confidence and not being proactive enough. After graduation, I spent a little over a year job hunting. During this time I tried to upskill and completed some certifications and got an informal internship/volunteer opportunity through networking, where I gained some experience in front-end work and databases.\n\nI then landed my first role as a Junior AI Engineer in August. In that role, I helped build out a few internal use cases for clients and worked with a hedge fund to analyze their GenAI platform and prioritize dev goals for 2025. Unfortunately, I was let go recently due to the company shutting down its AI practice.\n\nStill, I don't consider myself a strong candidate by any means, and the job market + the time that has passed since graduating definitely isn't in my favor. Despite sending out countless applications, I rarely hear back.\n\n**So Why Did I Pick CS?**  \nI picked CS because I saw long-term potential, not just financially, but also in terms of growth and problem-solving. I genuinely enjoyed the logic and creativity involved in coding. In college, I actually liked debugging and edge-case testing the code I created more than I expected.\n\nBut lately, that passion feels like it’s slipping away. It’s hard to stay motivated when things feel like they’re falling apart. It’s disheartening, and honestly, it’s making me question whether the last four years were a waste.\n\n**The Big Question at Hand**  \nRight now, I feel incredibly lost, probably like many others. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m falling behind, especially when I compare myself to peers who graduated around the same time.\n\nThe standard advice is to build personal projects and improve my portfolio. I get that, but I’m skeptical it’ll be enough, especially with how competitive the market is and how slow progress feels. Plus, with family constantly pressuring me about past career mistakes, it’s hard to stay focused without a clearer payoff or timeline.\n\nSo I’ve been thinking about my options:\n\n* **MSCS:** A way to “reset” and fill in the gaps from undergrad. It could help with imposter syndrome and open internship opportunities I didn’t get before/cant get right now. Given my very average undergrad GPA, I know I’d likely need to take the GRE to be more competitive, which I’m fine with. I’d aim to start in the **spring semester** to avoid the heavier fall admission competition and get started sooner.\n* **MS in a related field (e.g., another branch of engineering):** Broaden my skillset, explore new roles, and diversify my job prospects. Same as above, I’d plan to take the GRE and target a **spring start** to accelerate the transition and improve my odds.\n* **Full career pivot (e.g., new engineering undergrad):** A drastic change, and I know it would mean starting over and potentially wasting more years, but being stuck in limbo with no job security is taking a toll on me.\n* **Stick with CS and keep grinding**: Keep applying while building out a solid portfolio with personal projects and maybe open source contributions. It’s the most “practical” option, but also the slowest and hardest to stay motivated in without signs of progress.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nGraduated in May 2023 with a BS in CS. Spent little over a year job hunting (not trying to spend this long again) before landing a Junior AI Engineer role that lasted 8 months before being laid off. Now I feel like I’m back to square one. Trying to figure out if I should:\n\n* Double down and pursue an **MSCS**: A way to “reset” and fill in the gaps from undergrad & open internship opportunities (targeting spring start + potential GRE to boost my app),\n* Pivot to a **related engineering master’s:** Broaden my skillset, explore new roles, and diversify my job prospects,\n* Do a **full career change** with another undergrad degree, or\n* **Stick with CS**, build out personal projects, and keep applying indefinitely.\n\nFeeling burnt out and unsure what’s worth pursuing anymore. Would genuinely appreciate any honest constructive advice or perspective.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n(if you think there's a better sub for this question, let me know)",

        "author": "oksy_retard",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\n**tl'dr**: Interning as a sysadmin, dealing with a toxic manager who constantly taunts, humiliates, and micromanages me. Trying to survive the next 4 months. Should I escalate or just endure it?\n\nI’m currently an intern at a well known Indian company (think along the lines of MakeMyTrip and Zomato), working as a **trainee system administrator** on a 6-month contract. I have about 4 months left. I'm still in college. This is my first corporate job (full-time WFO), and I get paid a little over ₹10k/month.\n\nThe work itself is… fine. It’s repetitive and tiring, but I’ve tried to keep myself engaged by automating tasks, like setting up and configuring laptops through AD, to save time and improve things. Not getting appreciation for it doesn’t bother me much.\n\nWhat *does* bother me is my manager. He’s incredibly toxic.\n\nHe constantly **nags, taunts, and micromanages** me, even over trivial things. For example, I once installed Slack on a new machine and was just setting the theme when he came up behind me and snarked, *“Click on save changes, sir, what are you doing??”* Like, obviously, I know how to click save.\n\nI tried to stay professional and focus on work, but ignoring him seemed to escalate things. He escalates when I don’t react, and now his constant jabs are getting to me.\n\nA few examples:\n\n* I set up a system in a meeting room as instructed. The receptionist questioned me, so I informed my manager. He asked, *“What’s his name?”* I said I’d get it when I passed by again. His response? *“One day I’ll say something so bad to you, you’ll stop coming to the office.”*\n* I told the team I was competing in **Pentathon** (cybersecurity competition by NCIIPC + AICTE), and if selected, I’d need a week off to go to Delhi. I ranked 29th and got selected. I took *one* day off to get a consent letter signed from college. The next day, my manager pulls me aside and says, *“Seems you don’t like the work here — should I start looking for someone to replace you?”* When I told him my Delhi dates, he said, *“You never told me about this in the interview.”* (The competition didn’t even exist then!) I ended up canceling my trip out of stress, only for him to say later, *“Oh no, why’d you cancel? It was such a big opportunity!”* while someone across the desk repeated his words mockingly.\n* Last week, I went to the restroom, came back, was thirsty and realized bottle's empty, grabbed my bottle to refill it, and he stops me: *“Why are you going out? Go only once.”* Like… what??\n\nHe also seems **weirdly possessive,** when I talk to people from other teams, he gets snarky. Last friday he was explaining me about POSH and somehow made it about how this is why I shouldn't talk to or hangout with people from office. I expressed interest to the SRE head about learning DevOps and maybe interning on their team after this. Ever since, my manager keeps saying things like, *“Oh, you’re leaving us anyway,”* and *“Don’t be such a f*\\*\\*up when you join the other team.”\n\nHe brags about *saving me from HR’s wrath* because I usually come in around 10:30–10:45 AM (due to a long commute with my dad), even though HR only mandates 11–5.

        "content": "Hey everyone.\n\nSome background:\n\nI'll be graduating from my undergrad in CS in 2 months. I've made mistakes throughout my undergrad and even though i have built amazing projects (all alone), I've been a vibe coder throughout. For example, for my FYP, I made a very complex scheduling system for my university which is currently implemented and is in use, I made it completely from scratch, but again, vibe coded. I have made several other unique projects mostly vibe coded. I do have some sort of understanding of what I'm working on but cannot write code without AI. Although I have performed extremely well in University, have a really good GPA, got praised by a lot of professors for always handling the leadership role and making unique projects, but deep down I know, i need to heavily rely on an AI chatbot to get my shit done.\n\nAfter a lot of research online and on reddit, I have come down to two career pathways:\n\n**Data analytics -> Data science -> Potentially AI/ML Engineering in the long run (If I decide to pursue masters)**\n\nor\n\n**SWE/Backend Dev -> Data engineering**\n\nMy knowledge:\n\nA month ago i decided i want to dive into data analytics since i think it's an easy to enter field, if you have good real-world projects (but very saturated). I started polishing my SQL (trying my best not to gain help from AI) and would say I'm moderate since i have worked with databases multiple times in university. I know python but am currently understanding numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc for analysis. Once I'm done with that I will start building a good portfolio to initiate my analytics career. Although, according to my research, the initial pay isn't that great (65k)\n\nAs far as backend dev goes, likei mentioned before I've been a vibe coder and have mainly worked on django. I will have to properly understand and learn backend frameworks, tools, building pipelines and building APIs without the help of an AI chatbot. Since I would want to transition to data engineering if i do chose that path, I would have to learn cloud services from scratch, automation tools, scripting etc.\n\nI'm really confused on what pathway to select, I want to chose a pathway where it takes me less time to learn fully and not be competing with a thousand people for one single position and be able to stand out somehow. And as far as i see, SWE jobs look like they're cooked.\n\nI have until this weekend to make my final decision, SWE or data analytics, and then completely dive into that pathway and spend the rest of my days perfecting myself in that specific field.\n\nWhat would you guys do in this situation?",

        "content": "\nHi all, I’ll try to explain this as briefly as possible.\n\nSo I am recently coming off of working as a Data Engineer II for Big Bank A (BBA) for almost 2 years. After a few months of applications and interviews, I was offered a job as Data Engineer II at Big Shipping Company (BSC) for 24% greater salary and completely remote environment (BBA is going full RTO). Not the title or income jump I was hoping for, but still a significantly better option, which I took and where I am currently employed.\n\nLast month, the week before I was about to start working for BSC, I got an email from a recruiter at Big Bank B (BBB), where I had applied for Senior Data Engineer previously, telling me that my 6 month cooldown period from the previous application is over and I can jump straight to their final round “power day” cycle of interviews for the same position. I figured worst case I end up with a little more interview practice, so I took them up on it and yesterday I was presented with a written offer for a position one level down from what I was interviewing for, which they internally call “senior associate” but externally present as just “data engineer”. This is a bit of a seniority boost and a 56% salary boost from my job at BBA and a 26% salary boost from my recently started job at BSC. Thus, I am heavily inclined to accept it and leave BSC despite starting there recently.\n\nHere is my dilemma: in the recent interview process for BBB, I did not tell them that I was about to start a new position at BSC. The recruiter asked if I was still at BBA when setting up the interview, which I still was at the time (didn’t want to quit before I had to in the tariff war economy). But I didn’t mention I was about to start at BSC because I was worried it might make them pull back from wanting to interview me. I quit BBA and started at BSC on April 14, was interviewed by BBB the following week, given a verbal offer for BBB on April 30, and given a written offer on May 1.\n\nMy concern is that it could come up in a background check amidst the hiring process for BBB. I am hoping the service they use only requires month granularity (I can say I quit BBA in April instead of on April 14) so I don’t have to enter in my employment at BSC and field questions relating to that. At the same time, I think I should be prepared to field questions related to this if I am asked, and I would like to give an explanation that minimizes damage or mistrust from BBB. I figure worst case I get my offer rescinded and just stick with my job at BSC, but I would certainly like this offer from BBB to go through.\n\nAny thoughts on how I should frame this?",
