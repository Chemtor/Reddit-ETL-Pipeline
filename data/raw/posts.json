Most confusing shit ever.\n\nI'm more than willing to accept it's an skill issue. But I feel like documentation is pretty much useless. It doesn't help that every single tool decides to make up its own language and concepts to describe things. It doesn't help that the documentation isn't opinionated, straightforward, easy to follow, not all over the place, doesn't show clear examples, how to set it up, what's the proper project structure, what to do if you have a previous project, etc.\n\nAgain, I concede this may be a skill issue.

They should be simple to use IMO but it seems its quite the opposite.\n\nWith that said, if anyone has a good, updated, proper guide, preferrably from someone not trying to sell me something, on how to set up and use either of them, I would appreciate it a lot.",

After taking some notes from my last project, the workflow with AI felt much smoother, and I felt more in control over my prompts and my expectations of what it can provide me.\n\n2. This project was much simpler (tech wise). Much less tools, most of the project is only in python, which makes it easier for the AI to follow on the existing setup and provide better solutions and fixes.\n\n3. Some tasks just feels frustrating with AI even when you expect it to be very simple. (for example, no matter what I did, it couldn't make a list of my CSV column names, it just couldn't manage it, very weird.)\n\n4. When not using UI tools (like in AWS console for example), the workflow feels more right. you are much less likely to get hallucinations (which happened A LOT on AWS console)\n\n5. For the data visualization enthusiasts amongst us, I believe making graph settings for matplotlib and alike using AI is the biggest game changer I felt since coding with it. it saves SO MUCH time remembering what settings exists for each graph and plot type, and how to set them correctly.\n\nGithub repo: [https://github.com/roey132/streamlit\\_dashboard\\_demo](https://github.com/roey132/streamlit_dashboard_demo)\n\nStreamlit demo link: [https://dashboarddemoapp.streamlit.app/](https://dashboarddemoapp.streamlit.app/)\n\n  \nI believe this project was a lot easier to vibe code because its much smaller and less complex than the daily batch pipeline. that said, it does help me understand more about the potential and risks of vibe coding, and let's me understand better when to trust AI (in its current form) and when to doubt it's responses.\n\nto summarize:  when working on a project that doesn't have a lot of different environments and tools (this time, 90% python), the value of vibe coding is much higher. also, learning to make your prompts better and more informative can improve the final product a lot, but, still, the AI takes a lot of assumptions when providing answers, and you can't always provide it with 100% of the information and edge cases, which makes it provide very wrong solutions. Understanding what the process should look like and knowing what to expect of your final product is key to make a useful and steady app.\n\nI will continue to share my process on my next project in hope it can help anyone! \n\n(Also, if you have any cool idea to try for my next project, please let me know! i'm open for ideas)",

        "content": "Hey guys. I recently completed an ETL project that I've been longing to complete and I finally have something presentable. It's an ETL pipeline and dashboard to pull, process and push the data into my dimensionally modeled Postgres database and I've used Streamlit to visualize the data.\n\n  \nThe steps:  \n1. Data Extraction: I used the Fotmob API to extract all the match ids and details in the English Premier League in nested json format using the ip-rotator library to bypass any API rate limits.\n\n2. Data Storage: I dumped all the json files from the API into a GCP bucket. (around 5k json files)\n\n3. Data Processing: I used DataProc to run the spark jobs (used 2 spark workers) of reading the data and inserting the data into the staging tables in postgres. (all staging tables are truncate and load)\n\n4. Data Modeling: This was the most fun part about the project as I understood each aspect of the data, what I have, what I do not and at what level of granularity I need to have to avoid duplicates in the future. Have dim tables (match, player, league, date) and fact tables (3 of them for different metric data for match and player, but contemplating if I need a lineup fact).  Used generate\\_series for the date dimension. Added insert, update date columns and also added sequences to the targer dim/fact tables.\n\n5. Data Loading: After dumping all the data into the stg tables, I used a merge query to insert/update if the key id exists or not. I created SQL views on top of these tables to extract the relevant information I need for my visualizations. The database is Supabase PostgreSQL.\n\n6. Data Visualization: I used Streamlit to showcase the matplotlib, plotly and mplsoccer (soccer-specific visualization) plots. There are many more visualizations I can create using the data I have.\n\nI used Airflow for orchestrating the ETL pipelines (from extracting data, creating tables, sequences if they don't exist, submitting pyspark scripts to the gcp bucket to run on dataproc, and merging the data to the final tables), Terraform to manage the GCP services (terraform apply and destroy, plan and fmt are cool) and  Docker for containerization. \n\n  \nThe Streamlit dashboard is [live here](https://pldashboard.streamlit.app/) and [Github ](https://github.com/karthikgarimella37/EPL_Fotmob)as well. I am open to any feedback, advice and tips on what I can improve in the pipeline and visualizations. My future work is to include more visualizations, add all the leagues available in the API and learn and use dbt for testing and sql work.\n\n  \nCurrently, I'm looking for any entry-level data engineering/data analytics roles as I'm a recent MS data science graduate and have 2 years of data engineering experience. If there's more I can do to showcase my abilities, I would love to learn and implement them. If you have any advice on how to navigate such a market, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you've reached this point. I appreciate it. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4mq029q72ef1.jpg?width=871&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf3e8129c1a144e78b1decf32642278afc1e24f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m13gy8q72ef1.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=526ebcad5616d0bfcb1c6e4a8357cd6833c06d97\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lj70pv8q72ef1.png?width=1601&format=png&auto=webp&s=81b2094bb13d30c8a6b33798905f128b5c88f162\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/617odx8q72ef1.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef3bb7184eb9d012de8c9979df5c0da15be80b8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c42efw8q72ef1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6660c876a1487b5c7a313afbd28b90776a7dd64\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ynyb59q72ef1.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0433856dacc83622fd06f4aa6be764e688d554a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvu3lw8q72ef1.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=646dec3a6e11b8c268fc91a196eb8ad0d149ef59\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7v98w8q72ef1.png?width=1515&format=png&auto=webp&s=16180537c5ef391bea1f73619b68c75c4763f0c7\n\n",

Use 3 layers of spelling corrections using words from a bag of clean words with: word2vec, 2 layers of Levenshtein distance\n2. Create a master table of all degrees out there over 600 degrees\n3. Tokenize the free text input column, the degrees column from master table, crossjoin them and creacte a match score with the amount of matching words from the text column against the master data column\n4. To this point for each row it will have many cnadidates, so we're picking the degree name in which has the highest amount of matching words against the text column\n5. The output of this method tested with a portion of 500k records, and with 600 degrees in master table, we got over 75% matching score which means we found the equivalent degree name for 75% of the text records, it can be improved by adding more degree names, modify confidence %, and train the model with more data\n\nThis method combines 2 ML models, and finds the best matching degree name against each line\n\nThe output would be like this:\n\n    id, degree\n    1, technician in public relations, degree in public relations\n    2, bachelor in business management, bachelors degree in business management\n    3, high school diploma, high school degree\n    4, php, degree in software development\n    5, dgree in finance, degree in finance\n    6, masters in cs, masters degree in computer science\n    7, mstr in logisticss, masters degree in logistics\n\nI made it as a Python library based on PySpark which doesn't require any comercial LLM AI APIs ... fully open source, so that anyone that struggles with the same issue can use the library directly to save time and headaches\n\nYou can find the library on PyPi: [https://pypi.org/project/PyNLPclassifier/](https://pypi.org/project/PyNLPclassifier/)\n\nOr install it directly\n\n`pip install pynlpclassifier`\n\nI made an [article ](https://medium.com/@hamzahbdeveloper/introducing-pynlpclassifier-correct-the-spelling-and-categorize-large-free-text-input-data-using-da1a93408f30)explainning in depth the library, the functions, and an example of use case\n\nI hope you found my research work helpfull and that can be useful to share with the community.",

        "author": "SnooDogs4383",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks, I recently joined a consultancy where we manage data solutions for clients. My team primarily works on Databricks, and I was really impressed at first with Delta Live Tables (now called Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline) and Photon. It felt super intuitive, until I saw the $200 bill just from me testing it out. That was kinda absurd.\n\nAround the same time, I was optimizing a server for another team and stumbled onto DuckDB. I got pulled into a DuckDB rabbit hole. I loved how portable it is, and the idea of single-node compute vs. distributed jobs like Spark made a lot of sense. From what the DuckDB team claims, it can outperform Spark for datasets under \\~5TB, which covers most of what we do.\n\nThat got me thinking: Why not build a data platform where DuckDB is the compute engine, with the option to later switch to Spark (or something else) via an adaptor?\n\nHere’s the rough idea:\n\n1. Everything should work locally—compute and storage.\n2. Add adaptors to connect to any external data source or platform.\n3. Include tools that help design and stress-test data models (seriously, why do most platforms not have this built-in?).  \n\nI also saw that DuckDB Foundation released a new data lake standard that seems like a cleaner way to structure metadata compared to loose files on S3.\n\nMeanwhile:\n\n* Databricks just announced **Lakeflow Connect** to integrate with lots of SaaS platforms.  \n* MotherDuck is about to announce **Estuary**, which sounds like it’ll offer similar functionality.  \n* DuckLake (MotherDuck’s implementation of the lake standard) looks promising too.  \n\nSo here’s my actual question:  \n**Is there room or real need for a local-first data lake platform?** One that starts local for speed, cost, and simplicity—but can scale to the cloud later?\n\nI know it sounds like a niche idea. But a lot of small businesses generate a fair amount of data and don’t have the tools or people to set up a proper warehouse. Maybe starting local-first makes it easier for developers to play around without worrying about getting billed every time they test something?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts. Is this just me dev dreaming, or something worth building?",

However, we're running into scalability issues—particularly with writing to Redshift.\nTo support Redshift, we extended the Kafka JDBC Sink Connector by customizing its upsert logic to use MERGE statements. While this works, it's proving to be inefficient at scale. For example, one of our largest tables sees around 5 million change events per day, and this volume is starting to strain the system.\nGiven the upsert-heavy nature of our source systems, we’re re-evaluating our approach. We're considering switching to the Confluent S3 Sink Connector to write Avro files to S3, and then ingesting the data into Redshift via batch processes. This would involve using a mix of COPY operations for inserts and DELETE/INSERT logic for updates, which we believe may scale better.\nHas anyone taken a similar approach?

Company works with high sensitivity data and is very slow to adopt new technology due to hesitance to change. Company has a bespoke software suite and doesn’t hold user data. All data handled is internal and mostly comprised of gathering data from our applications (metrics, logs etc). \n\nI am looking to progress to DE as my skill set (I would say) is more suited to DE and I see this as a suitable next step. \n\nThe issues I face is the modern data stack feels very hard to gain experience in unless you are already in a role that gives exposure to these skills. As I work in a company who is reluctant to adopt new practices, and resistant to suggestions I feel a bit stuck on how to pivot. I am mid thirties with a mortgage and outgoings so an internship is not an option I can take. \n\nMy current role requires me gather data (mostly) from sources that may not already exist, mostly through scripting, storing the data in our on premise  SQL servers and then provide dashboards or applications (usually excel vba). I would say that my experience in these areas is expert level, although they do not lever any of the modern skills I see required in most job specs. I work with extremely messy data and in most cases it is a challenge to create clean analysis from this, which is why I find myself spending more time gathering the data than actually providing the end user with analysis.\n\nCan anybody provide suggestions on some specific things I can focus on portfolio wise that would help me move into DE. The issue I find is that I can state that I have done this or that in my portfolio although I am unable to quantify how I’ve done this or that with this tool at work to achieve this or that result. \n\nI have spent a lot of my own time upskilling (DE zoom camp, some other udemy courses like dbt, aws courses) and doing projects of my own, although I’m struggling to convert this into actual work experience with modern tools. \n\nCan anybody give advice, ideally from a recruiter perspective, how I can efficiently spend my time on tailoring my portfolio and cv to make that move successful. Also - will certs help? And if so, which particularly? I feel like AWS could benefit, although I’m yet to certify. \n",

How do I talk to data using natural language and what tool do I use for that \n\nIs there a guide I can follow. The main point of concerns for this revamp are cost & utilizing AI. \nThe management wants to talk to data using natural language. \n\n\n\nP.S: I would love to connect with Data Engineers who created a data warehouse from scratch to discuss this further \n\nEdit: I think I have given off a very wrong vibe from this post. \nI have previously worked as a DE but I haven't used these popular tools. I know DE concepts. I want to make a medallion architecture. I am well versed with DE practices and standards, I just don't want to implement something that is costly and not beneficial for the company. \n\nI think what I was looking for is how to weigh my options between different tools.

        "content": "I'm currently working with a medallion architecture inside Fabric and would love to hear how others handle the **raw → bronze** process, especially when mixing **incremental and full loads**.\n\nHere’s a short overview of our layers:\n\n* **Raw**: Raw data from different source systems\n* **Bronze (technical layer)**: Raw data enriched with technical fields like `business_ts`, `primary_hash`, `payload_hash`, etc.\n* **Silver**: Structured and modeled data, aggregated based on our business model\n* **Gold**: Smaller, consumer-oriented aggregates for dashboards, specific departments, etc.\n\nIn the **raw → bronze** step, a colleague taught me to create two hashes:\n\n* `primary_hash`: to uniquely identify a record (based on business keys)\n* `payload_hash`: to detect if a record has changed\n\nWe’re using Delta Tables in the bronze layer and the logic is:\n\n* **Insert** if the `primary_hash` does not exist\n* **Update** if the `primary_hash` exists but the `payload_hash` has changed\n* **Delete** if a `primary_hash` from a previous load is missing in the current extraction\n\nThis logic works well *if* we always had a full load.\n\nBut here's the issue: our source systems deliver **a mix of full and incremental loads**, and in incremental mode, we might only get a tiny fraction of all records. With the current implementation, that results in **95% of the data being deleted**, even though it's still valid – it just wasn't part of the incremental pull.\n\nNow I'm wondering:  \nOne idea I had was to **add a boolean flag** (e.g. `is_current`) to mark if the record was seen in the latest load, along with a `last_loaded_ts` field. But then the question becomes:  \n**How can I determine if a record is still “active” when I only get partial (incremental) data and no full snapshot to compare against?**\n\nAnother aspect I’m unsure about is **data retention and storage costs**.  \nThe idea was to **keep the full history of records** permanently, so we could go back and see what the data looked like at a certain point in time (e.g., *\"What was the state on 2025-01-01?\"*). But I’m concerned this could lead to **massive storage costs over time**, especially with large datasets.\n\nHow do you handle this in practice?\n\n* Do you keep historical records in Bronze or move history handling to Silver/Gold?\n* Do you archive older data somewhere else?\n* How do you balance auditability and cost?\n\nThanks in advance for any input! I'd really appreciate hearing how others are approaching this kind of problem or i'm the only Person.\n\nThanks a lot!",

Also, transferring ownership of Snowflake objects to many new roles is complicated and can effectively  break views for end users and change our \"future\" role assignments.

        "content": "What is a good approach when you want to insert an audit record into a table using dbt & Snowflake? \nThe audit record should be atomic with the actual data that was inserted, but because dbt does not support Snowflake transactions, this seems not possible. My thoughts are to insert the audit record in the post-hook, but if the audit record insert fails for some reason, my audit and actual data will be out of sync.\n\nWhat is the best approach to get around this limitation.\n\nI did try to add begin transaction as the first pre-hook and commit as the last post-hook, but although it works, it is hacky and then locks the table if there is a failure due to no rollback being executed.\n\nEDIT: Some more info\n\nMy pipeline will run every 4 hours or thereabouts and the target table will grow fairly large (already >1B rows). I am trying strategies for saving on cost (minimising bytes scanned, etc).\n\nThe source data has an updated_at field and in the dbt model I use: select from source where updated_at > (select max(updated_at) from target). The select max(updated_at) from target is computed from metadata, so is quite efficient (0 bytes scanned).\n\nI want to gather stats and audit info (financial data) for each of my runs. E.g. min(updated_at), max(updated_at), sum(some_value) & rowcount of each incremental load. Each incremental load does have a unique uid, so one could query from the target table after append, but that is likely going to scan a lot of data.\n\nTo mitigate against having to scan the target table for run stats, my thoughts were to stage the increment using a separate dbt model ('staging'). This staging model will stage the increment as a new table, extract the audit info from the staged increment and write the audit log. Then another model ('append') will append the staged increment to the target table. There are a few issues with this as well, including re-staging a new increment before the previous increment was appended. But I have ways around that, but it relies on the fact that audit records for both the staging runs and append runs are correctly and reliably inserted. Hence the question.",

In some scenarios, it's necessary for the load to always be full/overwrite.\n   2. **Partial/Block Merges:** The ability to perform complex partial updates, like deleting a block of records based on a business key and then inserting the new block (no primary-key at row level).\n2. **Merge for specific columns:** The environment tables have metadata columns used for lineage and auditing. Columns such as first\\_load\\_author and update\\_author, first\\_load\\_author\\_external\\_id and update\\_author\\_external\\_id, first\\_load\\_transient\\_file, update\\_load\\_transient\\_file, first\\_load\\_timestamp, and update\\_timestamp. For incremental tables, for existing records, only the update columns should be updated. The first\\_load columns should not be changed.\n\nMy perception is that DLT doesn't easily offer this level of granular control. Am I mistaken here? I'm new to this resource. I couldn't find any real-world examples for product scenarios, just some basic educational examples.\n\nOn the other hand, I considered a model with one continuous stream per table but quickly ran into the \\~145 execution context limit per cluster, making that approach unfeasible.\n\n**Current Proposal:** My current proposed solution is the reactive architecture shown in the image below: a central \"router\" detects new files and, via the Databricks Jobs API, triggers small, ephemeral jobs (using `AvailableNow`) for each data object.\n\n**My Question for the Community:** What are your thoughts on this event-driven pattern? Is it a robust and scalable solution for this scenario, or is there a simpler or more efficient approach within the Databricks ecosystem that I might be overlooking?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znq1swylp3ef1.png?width=5661&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f7a4d4ac35f7803c4aa1576a7f70d5cc641429a\n\nThe architecture above illustrates the Oracle source with AWS DMS. This scenario is simple because it's CDC. However, there's user input in files, SharePoint, Google Docs, TXT files, file shares, legacy system exports, and third-party system exports. These are the most complex writing scenarios that I couldn't solve with DLT, as mentioned at the beginning, because they aren't CDC, some don't have a key, and some have partial merges (delete + insert).\n\nThanks in advance for any insights or experiences you can share!",

Its running basic filters over 1B rows in 50ms (single node, no indexing), it’s currently outperforming ClickHouse by 10x on the same machine. \n\nI’m curious if this is interesting to people? I’m thinking this may be useful for:\n\n* real-time dashboards\n* lookups on pre-processed datasets\n* quick queries for larger model training\n* potentially even just general analytics queries for small/mid sized companies\n\nThere's a (very minimal) MVP up at [www.warpdb.io](http://www.warpdb.io) with playground if people want to fiddle.

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm working on a project where I'm building a chatbot that can answer questions from scanned infrastructure project documents (think government-issued construction certificates, with financial tables, scope of work, and quantities executed). I have around 100 PDFs, each corresponding to a different project.\n\nI want to build a chatbot which lets users ask questions like:\n\n* “Where have we built toll plazas?”\n* “Have we built a service road spanning X m?”\n* “How much earthwork was done in 2023?”\n\nThese documents are scanned PDFs with non-standard table formats, which makes this harder than a typical document QA setup.\n\n# Current Pipeline (working for one doc):\n\n1. **OCR**: I’m using Amazon Textract to extract raw text (structured as best as possible from scanned PDFs). I’ve tried Google Vision also but Textract gave the most accurate results for multi-column layouts and tables.\n2. **Parsing**: Since table formats vary a lot across documents (headers might differ, row counts vary, etc.), regex didn’t scale well. Instead, I’m using ChatGPT (GPT-4) with a prompt to parse the raw OCR text into a structured JSON format (split into sections like salient\\_feature, scope of work, financial burification table, quantities executed table, etc.)\n3. **QA**: Once I have the structured JSON, I pass it back into ChatGPT and ask questions like:The chatbot processes the JSON and returns accurate answers.“Where did I construct a toll plaza?” “What quantities were executed for Bituminous Concrete in 2023?”\n\n# Challenges I'm facing:\n\n1. **Scaling to multiple documents**: What’s the best architecture to support 100+ documents?\n   * Should I store all PDFs in S3 (or similar) and use a trigger (like S3 event or Lambda) to run Textract + JSON pipeline as soon as a new PDF is uploaded?\n   * Should I store all final JSONs in a directory and load them as knowledge for the chatbot (e.g., via LangChain + vector DB)?\n   * What’s a clean, production-grade pipeline for this?\n2. **Inconsistent table structures** Even though all documents describe similar information (project cost, execution status, quantities), the tables vary significantly in headers, table length, column allignment, multi-line rows, blank rows etc. Textract does an okay job, but still makes mistakes — and ChatGPT sometimes hallucinates or misses values when prompted to structure it into JSON. Is there a better way to handle this step?\n3. **JSON parsing via LLM: how to improve reliability?** Right now I give ChatGPT a single prompt like: “Convert this raw OCR text into a JSON object with specific fields: \\[project\\_name, financial\\_bifurcation\\_table, etc.\\]”. But this isn't 100% reliable when formats vary across documents. Sometimes certain sections get skipped or misclassified.\n   * Should I chain multiple calls (e.g., one per section)?\n   * Should I fine-tune a model or use function calling instead?\n\n# Looking for advice on:\n\n* Has anyone built something similar for scanned docs with LLMs?\n* Any recommended open-source tools or pipelines for structured table extraction from OCR text?\n* How would you architect a robust pipeline that can take in a new scanned document → extract structured JSON → allow semantic querying over all projects?\n\nThanks in advance — this is my first real-world AI project and I would really really appreciate any advice yall have as I am quite stuck lol :)\n\n",

The environment is draining, the market is saturated, the pay is low, and growing into senior roles feels nearly impossible unless you tolerate long-term toxicity, unpaid competitions, and constant deadline stress.\n\nI studied and worked in Germany, and I’m at a point where I’m seriously considering a shift. I’ve always had an interest in:\n\t•\tCoding\n\t•\tData\n\t•\tTrends and analysis\n\t•\tLogical thinking\n\nAt the same time, I’ve always had a creative eye. I care a lot about user experience — not just in buildings or cities, but in how people interact with things in general. That’s what drew me to look into Product Design and Data Analytics as possible career paths.\n\nThe thing is, job listings for data analytics seem higher in Germany. Product design roles are fewer, which makes me nervous. But I’m worried:\n\t•\tWill product design be just another draining, underpaid creative field like architecture?\n\t•\tWill data analytics be too dry or rigid long term?\n\t•\tAnd realistically, which path is better for career growth and salary in the long run?\n\nI’m not expecting overnight success, but I also don’t want to be stuck at a junior/mid salary range forever. I’m trying to find something where I can grow steadily, have a healthier work-life balance, and still enjoy what I do.\n\nIf anyone here has made the leap from architecture to either field (or knows someone who did), I’d love to hear what made the difference for you, and what you’d recommend.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏🏼 ",

They use SSIS - with some additional third-party connectors - to ingest the data to SQL Server in an ETL approach.  The primary customer are BI analysts using a phenomenally busy on-premise Tableau Server.\n\nFrom what I have seen it's functioning well and people have made good use of the data.  For a public sector organisation I am impressed by what they've achieved!\n\nThe limitations are no distinction between dev and prod, no CI/CD setup or version control, no clarity on dependencies, no lineage visibility outside of the handful of developers, and data models that only exist within Tableau.\n\nTheir budget for new licensing is the square root of zero.  They have explored cloud (Azure) but their data sources are so broad and their usage is so high that the costs would be beyond their budget.  They started looking at dbt Core but have cold feet due to the growing divide between Core and Cloud.\n\nI have read some very good things about SQL Mesh and I think it would tackle a lot of their current limitations.  My thinking is to retain SSIS but as EL and implement SQL Mesh as the T.\n\nHas anyone tackled anything similar before or have any thoughts beyond my limited thinking?  The team seem up for the challenge but I don't want to lead them in the wrong direction as it's a big overhaul!",

        "author": "sumant28",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "This seems like it should be a really basic pattern but I have been struggling to figure out what is ideal rather than just what will work. To my surprise I do not really see an existing solution that entirely answers this post but from ChatGPT I have a strong hunch what I need to do but I have further issues to clarify.\n\n\nIf there is a daily ingest of about 1MB of data in JSON is it best to partition that data in the raw or bronze folder from the date as a string or instead to partition by year, month and day. All this time I was doing the latter approach thinking that was optimal but I have since found out that only is best for huge data systems which often further partition into hours and minutes and deal with petabytes or terabytes of data.\n\n\nThe issue I have learned is that partition trees grow too large with calendar partitions rather than the simple flat structure of date strings. However my issue is that in terms of queries I have nothing ad hoc. The only thing the data is used for is to create dashboards filtering at different levels of time granularity. For example some dashboards would be by week, some by fortnight, some by month, some by year.\n\n\nFor these queries that power these dashboards I do not know if the earlier partition even allows any benefits of partitions at all. I read that the partition still helps but I was not able to understand why. My most important dashboard is by week and I do not see how a partition by date string allows the query engine to speed up filtering by the current week or the previous week.\n\n\nI have some other questions specific to AWS. For the etl job that transforms the bronze layer to parquet I learned that bookmarks also need to be used. I read that it is best practice to have as a source the crawled data catalog table rather than the JSON files. Is this still true? That means for job bookmarking in order to process only incremental data you have to rely on a key which is a column of data or field rather than the easier to understand bookmarking by file. If you are bookmarking by key that points to using date string rather than using a trio of date partitions like year, month and day which are all also nested. For reducing complexity is that the right assumption?",

        "author": "planesforstars",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Last year, I found myself in a familiar cycle: I'd watch a tutorial, follow along perfectly, feel like a programming genius... then completely freeze when faced with a blank editor and a real problem to solve. I knew the syntax. I could explain concepts. But I couldn't *build* anything meaningful without a step-by-step guide.\n\nSound familiar? I've come to call this the competent imposter phase - where you understand enough to recognize good code, but not enough to produce it independently.\n\n# The Gap No One Talks About\n\nI've noticed a pattern in programming education that no one seems to address directly: there's a massive cognitive leap between understanding code and generating it. It's like knowing all the rules of chess but having no strategic intuition. You know how the pieces move, but you can't see the patterns that make a good player.\n\nAfter months of frustration, I decided to approach this problem systematically. Here's what I discovered works:\n\n# 1. Reverse Engineering > Tutorials\n\nInstead of watching more tutorials, I started downloading open-source projects that were *just* beyond my skill level. Not massive frameworks, but small utilities with 300-1000 lines of code.\n\nThe process: Run the program to understand what it does Read through the code without judgment Delete small sections and try to reimplement them Gradually expand what I deleted until I could recreate substantial portions\n\nThis forced me to think like the original developer rather than just consuming their finished work.\n\n# 2. The Tiny Feature Technique\n\nOne of my breakthroughs came when I stopped trying to build complete applications. Instead, I focused on adding tiny features to existing code:\n\n* Take a simple calculator app and add a history feature Add dark mode to a static website Implement a simple search function in a list app\n\nThis approach gave me the scaffolding to work within while still requiring creative problem-solving.\n\n# 3. Deliberate Debugging Practice\n\nI started intentionally breaking working code, then fixing it. This might sound counterproductive, but it taught me to read error messages properly and understand how the pieces fit together.\n\nI'd introduce a bug, wait 24 hours (so I'd forget exactly what I changed), then come back and fix it. This simulated the real-world experience of debugging unfamiliar code.\n\n# 4. The Explain It To A Beginner Test\n\nAfter implementing something, I forced myself to write an explanation as if teaching it to someone who just started coding. This revealed gaps in my understanding that weren't apparent when I was just following along with tutorials.\n\nIf I couldn't explain a concept clearly, I knew I needed to revisit it.\n\n# 5. Embracing Uncomfortable Tools\n\nI noticed I was avoiding certain technologies because they felt intimidating. For me, this was working with APIs and asynchronous code.\n\nSo I created a rule: at least once a week, I'd work on something that made me uncomfortable. Not to master it immediately, but to reduce the anxiety around it.\n\n# The Mental Shift That Changed Everything\n\nThe biggest change came when I stopped thinking of programming as knowing things and started seeing it as figuring things out.\n\nExperienced developers aren't successful because they've memorized everything - they're successful because they've developed robust mental models for approaching new problems. They know how to break down complex tasks, research effectively, and test their assumptions.\n\n# My Practical Advice\n\n1. **Create a Learning Project** \\- A single, evolving project you keep enhancing as you learn new concepts. Mine was a personal book tracking app that grew from a command-line tool to a web app over 6 months.\n2. **Code Review Yourself** \\- After completing something, wait a week, then review your own code as if it was written by someone else. Be critical but constructive.",

But unfortunately those questions can't really be answered - but fortunately it doesn't really matter!\n\nRemember that a programming language is *a language* \\- and just like other languages created by humans, they are used to convey ideas to other humans. The computer doesn't care about the language you program it in, it only understands machine code, so the moment your program compiles you are basically free to throw away the source code. Except you don't do that, because you might want to change things later, or have someone else look at the code, another human, or a large language model, that also (tries to) understand language.\n\nSo learning a programming language is a lot like learning any other language - there are syntax rules, grammar, different classes of words: verbs, nouns, adjectives and so on, and there are all the words in the language. A lot of them added by other humans, and in most cases still being added.\n\nIf you managed to learn English (or whatever other secondary language you learnt) by reading the definition of the grammar and syntax, committing all the special cases to memory, and memorizing every single word, well, then maybe that will also work for you when learning programming! - But most of us didn't learn it that way, we picked up a few words, understood the sentence-structure, partly, tried to use the language, spoke and wrote, and made a lot of mistakes. And gradually we got better and better, learned more \"rules\" and even more exceptions to those rules, and picked up a lot of new words as we went along.\n\nNobody has ever \"completed\" learning English - for one the language always changes, and always has, and also there are simply to many words, to many dialects even, to ever learn everything.\n\nSame goes for programming - you will probably never complete any language, there will always be something new to learn, or something that *you* use so rarely that you forget about it, and have to look it up on the rare occasions that you *do* need it.\n\nBut that shouldn't discourage you from learning other languages - if you have to travel to France or Spain, you'll probably need to learn some French or Spanish, and you might even like it so much that you decide to stay and learn more - while still keeping your English, maybe forgetting a bit more than before, but never mind, you still know how to look it up!\n\n\n\nThere are some grammar rules that you'll never understand, but somehow manage to use anyways. A lot of languages have gendered words, with very unspecific rules about why a specific word is one gender, but you'll get used to it \"sounding wrong\" when you use the wrong one. Same in programming, you might not be able to fully comprehend async or lambdas or closure, but just use it to write code where it \"sounds right\". A number of books and blogposts will try to invent rules to remember, but often they are even more difficult to understand, and also quite often simply wrong. So you'll get by and just \"do programming\" always feeling that you don't fully understand everything.\n\nLike you don't fully understand everything in the languages you write or speak - like you haven't meticulously memorized every single word, but somehow still use them. \n\n  \nAnd some people find it easy to adapt to new languages, while others keep talking the dialect of their hometown even after having lived everywhere else their entire life. Sometimes you hear or read a word, and immediately understand it, other times you'll struggle your entire career with the spelling or pronouncination of some. The experience is different for everyone, and there is no set speed for how anything takes anyone else to learn.\n\nI hope that those of you fixating on languages will read and understand this - and maybe stop worrying so much, and get going using the languages - the programming languages - to actually build something. Not important original masterpieces, just small stories where you use the language as you are learning.",

First off, Thanks for all of the help you guys provided. I'm still reading a lot of them and very sorry if I can't reply on all of it.\n\nSecond, I decided to stick to C# and check the waters again and probably give it a week and if not I'm switching to Python and if that still sucks like someone commented just stick with C.\n\nNow the IDE, I can't use VStudio cause I'm using Mint. I used jetbrains before but my oh my that IDE is so laggy in my Computer ( I told you computer is ass! ). A lot of people commented on Vim & Neovim. Now, I know those two are good and maybe you can also include LazyVim but I am just a beginner. I don't even know how to use a library let alone customising Vim to make it in a IDE. So Im at VS code at the moment.\n\nA lot of you guys are too good for me xD.\nVim is nice cause you don't really need to use a mouse whenever you code. It will be a lot faster just using the keyboard but it has steep learning curve y' know just like playing Dark souls. It takes a while and I just want to learn a language before I can jump to Vim.\n\nI know this edit is a long ass speech of drama but I really appreciate the help! \n",

        "content": "If you're a complete beginner who's just started programming or are about to begin your journey, please go through this first (This really helped me put things into perspective):\n\nWhat is programming?\n\n- I know you kinda know what it is but I bet most don't. We all know the bookish definition. But have you actually ever thought about it a bit deeper?\n\nA computer is a really dumb machine when it comes to doing things human can do and understand. If you say to a human - Go fetch me that pen 🖊️ that's over there on the table! \n\nThey will gladly go and bring it to you. \n\nBut to a computer (machine) you'd need to break that instruction into steps. Steps that may look like the following:\n\nStep 1: Hey computer! Get up, if you're sitting.\nStep 2: Now locate the table.\nStep 3: Identify something that looks like a pen 🖊️ \nStep 4: Head over to the table\nStep 5: Pick up the pen\nStep 6: Locate the person\nStep 7: Head over to the person with the pen\nStep 8: Give the pen to the person\nStep 9: Wait for further instructions.\nStep 10: If no instructions given go back to where you were earlier. \n\nI may have missed a few steps here but you get the idea. Right?\n\nTo a computer you would need to tell it the exact steps it would have to perform to complete the task.\n\nAnd that right there is programming. \n\nThe instruction I have written use English language which a computer doesn't understand so humans built programming languages like C, Python etc.\n\nSo every time you sit down to write a program just remember that you're telling a computer what it needs to do to complete a task. That's it. \n\nHence, learning programming is more about developing your ability to break a problem into steps & convert those steps into code. \n\nNote: I know this is super basic stuff but strangely none of my teachers back in college explained it to me this way. And knowing this now makes things a bit easier. \n",

        "author": "ShlomoCh",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I'm a relatively new teacher at a high school (15-17 y/o's), and I teach programming. The subject only has one 40-minute class a week per group, **with no option for giving them homework or anything outside of class hours**.\n\nI first learned programming with Unity and C#, and that's what I want to try with them. I think static typing and having an interface is a good way to teach programming, and game dev simply sounds more fun. I tried it already for a few months last year, it didn't really work out, it was too confusing for them. But I still want to give it a shot. (Especially now that I'm actually going to have a fucking projector so they can see my screen). (Hopefully). (Yes this is not a very high-budget school).\n\nThe idea is to teach them the very basics C# (variables, conditionals, functions, maybe arrays and loops), and have them play with the basic Unity components (sprites, colliders, rigidbodies, and basic GUI). No OOP (except to interact with components). No 3D. No fuss. But even that sounds like too much for our restrictions, with my limited experience.\n\nSo, how would you approach giving a class like that? I don't know if this is the right place, but I really don't know where else to post this.\n\nI'm not married to the idea of Unity or gamedev though, I'm open to suggestions. But it has to be something interactive and graphical so they're interested. Bear in mind these are high-schoolers, most of them aren't interested in programming, and the class is only there to kind of teach them how computers work and how to think systematically.\n\nSome other things I've thought of:\n\n* Tkinter: don't love the idea of dynamically-typed Python, and not that engaging\n* Godot: interface more confusing than Unity's imo\n* Pygame: even if it's simpler, no GUI at all is arguably way harder\n* Arduino: really cool idea and easier programming, but obviously we'd need Arduinos, which we don't have, and emulators like TinkerCAD just aren't the same\n* Java forms on NetBeans: not that engaging\n\nI'd love to hear any insight or suggestions whatsoever, especially if any of you have been teachers.",

        "content": "I'm a practicing attorney who has been studying programming and computer science in my free time for the past 3+ years. Looking for advice on the best next step in my programming journey.\n\n**Background:** 37 y/o attorney with a Bachelors from Duke but in a non-STEM field. Spent the last 3 years doing MIT's undergrad Computer Science curriculum as well as the Odin Project. I would say I have an intermediate-level understanding of a lot of the concepts you would typically learn in an undergrad CS curriculum like OOP, DSA (basic concepts like DFS, BFS, linked lists, etc. as well as some slightly more advanced concepts like skip lists, VEB trees, linear programming, etc.), basic hardness proofs, discrete math, basic computer architecture, etc. Unfortunately because I went the entirely self-taught route, aside from portfolio projects I don't have any sort of credential to demonstrate this knowledge (for this reason, I'd recommend people avoid going that route if they can help it).\n\n**Goals:** At a minimum, I'd like to be able to sit for the patent bar and potentially leverage that to work more with clients in the tech industry. The dream scenario would be to make a career switch to software engineering but given my age and the state of the market I know that is extremely unlikely, so more focused on how I could leverage this for my law practice.\n\n**Path I'm Considering:** Am I crazy for thinking that Western Governors University is a logical next step for me? It's inexpensive, it seems like I might be able to grind through the curriculum pretty quick, and then I would at least have the Bachelors in CS box checked. The downside is that some of the stuff I read elsewhere on Reddit makes it sound like a diploma mill. But other online bachelors are much more expensive and might take me over 2 years to finish, and at the end of the day they are still online degrees so not sure they would even carry that much more weight anyway. \n\nI'm also really intrigued by Georgia Tech's OMSCS, but surprisingly it sounds like it would *not* be enough for me to sit for the patent bar because it's a Masters not a Bachelors. However, if I could knock out WGU in the next 6-9 months I could apply to GT in the Spring if I decide I want to go that route, so that's maybe another benefit of taking the WGU path.\n\nFor those who have gone to WGU or who are knowledgeable about the various options for an online bachelors in CS, is WGU really so much worse than other online programs that it is worth the extra time and money to do another program? Or am I right for thinking that it makes sense for someone in my position?\n\n",

        "content": "I've been trying to learn programming for about 3 years now. I started with genuine enthusiasm, but I always get overwhelmed by the sheer number of resources and the complexity of it all.\n\nAt some point, A-Levels took over my life and I stopped coding. Now, I’m broke, unemployed, and desperately trying to learn programming again — not just as a hobby, but as a way to build something that can actually generate income for me and my family.\n\nHere’s what I’ve already tried:\n\n1. FreeCodeCamp YouTube tutorials — I never seem to finish them.\n\n\n2. Harvard CS50’s Python course.\n\n\n3. FreeCodeCamp’s full stack web dev course.\n\n\n4. Books on Python and one on C++.\n\n\n\nBut despite all of this, I still feel like I haven’t made real progress. I constantly feel stuck — like there’s so much to learn just to start building anything useful. I don’t have any mentors, friends, or community around me to guide me. Most days, it feels like I’m drowning in information.\n\nI’m not trying to complain — I just don’t know what to do anymore. If you’ve been where I am or have any advice, I’d really appreciate it.\n\nI want to turn my life around and make something of myself through programming. Please, any kind of help, structure, or guidance would mean the world to me. 🙏",

        "author": "Puzzleheaded-Mix5149",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello all, I hope this is ok to post here. I am a complete beginner to programming and my second language is Cree. I am posting here to ask how I should tackle this large project I have envisioned. My goal is to create a desktop-based application that is a dictionary for my Indigenous language. However I would like this to be more than just a dictionary, for example I would like to include all the conjugation tables for all verbs, which we have quite a lot in Cree. (In fact, around 85% of “words” in Cree are verbs). This would literally require tens of thousands of entries.\n\nNow every word can have quite a number of connections to other concepts. For example I envision this dictionary to include a section for synonyms and antonyms for each entry,  each entry having a section for “semantic field” for related entries, a section for each entry showing all other entries from the root of that word. As well as relationships between words that mean the same, for example the same verb, just simply having a different gender for the object.\n\nI will just give some examples below:\n\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᓐ (aahkwaatin) means “it is fierce, harmful”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᓰᐤ (aahkwaatisiiu) means “s/he is fierce, harmful”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᔅᑲᑎᓐ (aahkwaaskatin) means “it is frozen very solid”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᔕᒻ (aahkwaatisham) means “s/he cuts it badly, seriously”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑲᒥᑌᐤ (aahkwaakamiteu) means “it is painfully hot liquid”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑌᔨᒣᐤ (aahkwaateyimeu) means “s/he thinks s/he is harmful, dangerous”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᓯᓈᑯᓐ (aahkwaasinaakun) means “it looks dangerous, harmful”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑖᐦᑲᓴᒻ (aahkwaataahkasam) means “s/he burns it badly”\n\nYou can see the pattern. Certain parts of the word mean certain things and this can be applied to all other words, this complex connectedness is what I would like to show and be able to interact with in my dictionary. To be able to categorize, display and filter through such related roots and terms.\n\nMy question is which programming language should I learn to attempt such a project? As well as any tips or references that you all may have on how I should approach such a complex project.\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to read through this and helping me keep my language alive and flourishing.\n\nAlso, if this language interests you, feel free to PM me to learn more about it! I am clearly passionate about my language and willing to share my knowledge with others.",

        "content": "**NOTE:** I made that post in r/Unicode as well, but as that community is both small and not programming related, I'm posting here to have more chances to get an answer.\n\nI am trying to implement code for Unicode and, I was just checking the [available codes](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/) and while everything was going well, when I reached to the 4-byte codes, things started pissing me off. So, I would expect that the latest codes will not be defined, as Unicode has not yet used all the available numbers for the 4-byte range. So for now, I'll just check the latest available one and update my code in new Unicode versions.\n\nNow, here is the bizarre thing... For some reason, there are undefined codes BETWEEN sets! For some reason, the people who design and implement Unicode decided to leave some codes empty and then, continue normally! For example, the codes between [adlam](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#adlam) and [indic-siyaq-numbers](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#indic-siyaq-numbers) are not defined. What's even more crazy is that in some sets themselves, there are undefined codes. One example is the set [ethiopic-extended-b](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#ethiopic-extended-b) which has about 3 codes not defined.\n\nBecause of that, what would be just a simple \"start/end\" range check, it will now have to be done with an array that has different ranges. That means more work for me to implement and worse performance to the programs that will use that code.\n\nWith all that in mind, unless there is a reason that they implemented it that way and someone knows and can tell me, I will have my code consider the undefined codes as valid and just be done with it and everyone that has a problem can just complain to the Unicode organization to fix their mess...",

        "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm a 23-year-old self-taught developer from Poland. I live in one of the biggest cities (Poznań).\n\nOver the past four years, I’ve been teaching myself programming, primarily working with the React stack.\n\nDue to some health challenges, it was tough to commit to a full-time job, so I kept going through freelancing and one-off projects while continuing to improve my skills. Eventually, I realized freelancing wasn't the right long-term path for me, so I decided to pursue full-time employment.\n\nWhile doing some research, I came across tons of discouraging posts claiming that landing an entry-level dev job is almost impossible these days. Most of these were about the US market - not the EU - so I was wondering:\n\nIs there a big difference between the two in terms of how hard it is to land a job and what kind of skills are expected?\n\nI get that a lot of these comments probably come from people who gave up before actually breaking into the industry - but they still made me very anxious.\n\nI’m not chasing amazing benefits or a six-figure salary - I just want a stable job doing what I enjoy, with room to grow and improve.\n\nNot gonna lie, doomscrolling through programming subs has left me feeling genuinely depressed this past week, I don't know what to believe anymore.\n\nAt one point, I even started questioning whether I should switch fields entirely, just because it felt like I might end up stuck in the job-hunting loop forever.\n\nIs it really that bad these days, even if you've got the time and space to grind and stay consistent? \n",

I’m a junior dev currently learning backend web development and building my own authentication system for a project.\n\nHere’s some context:\n\n* I’m building a **signup/login flow** using Supabase.\n* I use Supabase's **Auth Management HTTP API**, not their frontend SDK.\n* The flow is:\n   1. The **client** sends an HTTP request to **my server** with credentials.\n   2. My server does validation/processing.\n   3. Then it makes an HTTP request to Supabase (signup/login endpoint).\n   4. If Supabase returns a JWT, the **server should send it back to the client**.\n\nThis is the high level design of how things would work, removing the additional steps and etc..\n\nNow here’s where I’m stuck:\n\n>\n\nI thought I would need correlation IDs or session tracking or something, but now I’m learning maybe the HTTP protocol handles that automatically — but I’m not 100% sure how.\n\nCan someone explain this? Does each HTTP request automatically maintain its response pipe or connection, even if there are multiple users? Do I need to manually track which request came from who?\n\n  \nThank you in advance",

I’ve been programming for about two years and just started my first job as a backend developer a couple of weeks ago. They put me on a project where I have to **build everything from scratch**, completely on my own, and here’s the kicker:\n\n* The requirements were explained in a super vague way;\n* There’s no clear architecture or technical guidelines;\n* There’s no testing setup or staging environment;\n* **Deadline: three weeks.**\n\nIn the last couple of days, the anxiety has completely taken over. I feel like I’m writing terrible, unstructured code because I have no idea if I’m even heading in the right direction. I can’t properly test anything, which makes me feel even worse. I’ve been so stressed that I’ve cried and even started doubting if I made the right career choice.\n\n**My main questions:**\n\n1. How do you approach projects with unclear requirements when you’re working solo?\n2. How do you make something at least *somewhat* testable when you don’t have any infrastructure or environment to rely on?\n3. If you’ve experienced this kind of anxiety or burnout early in your career, how did you handle it and regain some confidence?\n\nAny advice, personal stories, or even just “this is normal, breathe” would mean a lot.

However, I am struggling to find roles that I feel I would be suited for. I know that what I like is more low-level stuff (specifically C++), and that I don't really have any interest in web development or working in the traditional \"big tech\" companies, which I feel like are the dominant hiring fields for new grads. I think embedded systems would be a good fit for me, or possibly programming for telecom (though maybe that's also just embedded systems?). I will have a few decently-sized resume projects under my belt by graduation, and one will hopefully be done by the end of the summer for earlier application deadlines. I'm also interested in AI, but more of the mathematical/backend stuff (i.e. being one of the people working on PyTorch itself or developing new models, not just using PyTorch to create a CNN or something).\n\nSo, my questions: What kind of things should I be looking for as I search for job postings online? When I'm looking for alumni from my school to connect with, what kind of roles should I be looking for them to have? What skills should I be developing over the next year to get a position like the one I want? (Also, any other general advice from people who have been on a similar path is appreciated).",

In 2023, I completed CS50 Python and in 2024 finished CS50x, though I could only do one real project for each — both were course finals — since school kept me busy. After graduating, I finally had time and built around 8 projects. For the first few, I had clear ideas but rushed the process, using ChatGPT a lot for code (though I understood the logic). Later, I changed my approach: I'd plan the project, share my thought process with ChatGPT, ask for feedback on my logic, request pseudocode if needed, and then code it step-by-step. If stuck, I'd ask for guidance — not code — especially with library functions. I even added “No code dump, just guide me” to my prompts. It helped me learn a lot, but I’m wondering: **am I on the right path?** Is there a better way to balance learning and coding with AI support? Should I continue this approach?",

Mostly writing a SQL query and making a small change to some backend code.\n\nThe AI read through our codebase, figured out the context, wrote the query, updated the code, created a PR with a clear diff and a well-written description, and pushed it for review. All in just a few minutes.\n\nThis wasn’t boilerplate. It followed our naming conventions, made logical decisions, and even updated a test. One of our senior engineers reviewed the PR and said it looked solid and accurate. They would have done it the same way.\n\nWhat really hit me is that this isn’t some future concept. This AI tool is being gradually rolled out across teams in our org as part of a pilot program. And it’s already producing results like this.\n\nI’ve been following AI developments, but watching it do my job in my codebase made everything feel real in a way headlines never could. It was a ticket I would have knocked out before lunch, and now it’s being done faster and with less effort by a machine.\n\nI’m not saying engineers will be out of jobs tomorrow. But if an AI can already handle these kinds of everyday tickets, we’re looking at serious changes in the near future. Maybe not in years, but in months.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar? What are you doing to adapt? How are you thinking about the future of our field?",

And most importantly, who wants to start unionizing to stop this?",

I have been applying like crazy and finally got an interview with a company, and I thought that “Finally, I might land this job as I cleared 4 rounds”. But bro, this one totally broke me.\n\nHere’s how it went:\n\n1. **HR call** – pretty standard.\n2. **Online assessment** – did well - JavaScript, node.js, SQL questions and 2 LeetCode questions\n3. **Home Assignment** – spent DAYS on this. I built a full-stack review dashboard for customer reviews approval by manager and integrated it with their main website to match the UI/UX (not their production app, just matched exact same UI and CSS and made a separate page to show it working).. Added other features also. Discussed it in-depth with the CTO (1-hour technical discussion).\n4. **Follow-up Round** –  1-hour technical with the CTO. For this round, he asked me to implement OpenAI API for text analysis of reviews and auto-suggestions based on customer feedback. I thought it went well as he was happy with my work and told me to prepare for next round.\n5. **Final Boss The CEO Round** – I was asked a system design question (LLD) around 3rd-party APIs. I started explaining my thought process.... then he just abruptly ended it with a \"have a nice day\" after 15 minutes. No feedback. No explanation. Just gone.\n\nNo idea what went wrong. After the interview, I was sitting on my chair, totally numb and thinking that I just spent 20+ hours building a working AI tool for you and in just 15 minutes got a sweet rejection.\n\nI am so much drained and frustrated. That home assignment alone took so many days. I researched and studied so many things for the assessment. Today, I feel burned out and feel like leaving the software industry. Don't know when this cycle of unemployment will end. 😭😭😭😫\n\nAnyway, just needed a place to vent this out.\n\nThanks for reading. Back to the grind 😒",

Recently got laid off, even though he was told several times that his program that he was a part of was absolutely essential, like one of the most important things in the company. Working on co-pilot and other AI tools that would be making millions of dollars. All of his hard work, working himself to the point of near exhaustion, he was rewarded with unemployment.

These AI agents would not just automate coding, but also perform broader tasks like negotiations and decision-making—mostly for other AI agents.\n\nHe aims to deploy the **first billion AI agents by the end of 2025**, with **trillions more to follow**, suggesting a sweeping automation of roles traditionally handled by humans.

Remember that software is written for people using a human readable language. It will forever serve humans and will require human operators. AI will never fully replace you.\n\nExperienced folks also tend to lose motivation and become bitter over time. New grads will always deliver a wave of fresh energy and competition. With a good blend of naïveté and starry eyed optimism, you’re a hot commodity. Like a vampire, company needs annual new blood to keep innovating. FANG will always have new grad hiring programs. \n\nLastly, this is still a golden age for software. The responsibility for a software engineer would evolve to take on more breadth. CEOs won’t suddenly add “prompting software to do shit” on their schedules.  It will still be you bringing that software to life.\n\nIf you love the field, love the course work, you should still be very excited about the prospects of this career. \n\n",

        "content": "Long story short, I just couldn't take it anymore.\n\nI worked at a small startup, so things had to be fast-paced. I worked hard. Really hard. Always put up with long nights, long code reviews, etc. The whole nine yards. But, in the real world, working hard doesn't mean jack shit if it doesn't produce good results. Or, at least, the results your boss wants in the timely manner that they please. So I was always on the disappointing end of my boss. There was never a time when I was good enough for him. I always felt... mediocre. And this isn't to pin anything on my boss or whatever. I'm just saying that I wasn't able to live up to his expectations.\n\nI lost a lot of sleep over the fact that I was just never good enough; I was never off of work mode, due to the anxiety and the constant self-deprecation. There were even nights when I'd run to the toilet for a quick vomit session due to the stress.\n\nThere was always something to complain about. Something to say about my not being good at this or that. \"Why did you do it like this?\" and \"You definitely had AI write up this code, didn't you?\" (no, I didn't). Despite it all, I still tried. I tried my darnedest. I grit my teeth and took everything as feedback and always thanked him. I always tried applying what I was told. I always admitted when I fell short, never pushing back or disrespecting my boss due to my feelings or ego being hurt. I always took everything on the chin. But it always ate at me. So, of course, I snapped. I told my boss that I was quitting cold turkey. Why? It was the only way out of the intense burnout that I could see.\n\nTo my surprise, he didn't want me to quit. But of course. It costs money to find, hire, and train a new engineer, and it's risky when you don't really know what that new engineer could be capable of (or not), as opposed to the engineer that you already have and are familiar with. So I'm not surprised. But I've known my boss for a while now. Me revoking my quitting was not going to solve anything for *me*. Maybe it would've in the short-term at my job, but I know that things would've just gone back to how they always were. That's how life rolls. So I doubled down and told him that I was not open to changing my mind.\n\nI'm going to be moving back in with my parents as soon as possible. Don't know when that is yet. I'm still... going through the motions. But, for now, I'm jobless. I'm in a weird place right now, emotionally, where I feel very relaxed and liberated in that I no longer have to put up with the stress that I did at work. But, at the same time, I'm afraid of whether or not I'll get work at all anytime soon. I'm afraid of whether or not this was a good call.\n\nBut, the way things were, I knew the one answer that I needed at the time: A break from work. A long break. A few months would be nice.\n\nRegardless, this is where I'm at right now.\n\nHow's *your* work life? lol\n\n---\n\nUpdate: Hey! This post was originally meant for me to just relieve myself of some negative energy. I honestly didn't think it was going to get anywhere, but here we are, over 300 upvotes later lol. I've read through most of the responses, and I just want to thank you all. Like, really. In times like this, realistic advice is always the best advice, and a lot of you took the time to write up thoughtful and helpful responses. I really appreciate that.

        "content": "I'm a backend engineer at a (well funded) startup, helped out with the interview process recently. We wanted to fill these 3 roles: backend, devops, and data engineering. I was surprised at how quickly we were able to wrap it up.\n\nCouple of observations:\n\n__You're actually pretty cooked if you don't have networking skills.__\n\nWe received 500+ applications across all the 3 roles in just one week, which seemed crazy for a seed stage startup in a niche industry. Even after filtering them for (a) location (given lots of people from abroad or other cities were yolo applying) (b) relevant experience (have they worked with the same stack before?) and (c) school (least weight but obviously relevant), we had about \\~50 quality candidates, or about \\~15 for each role. Quick 30 intro + technical verbal call with them filtered down the pool to \\~5 per role. We then did more in-depth technical interviews.\n\nFunnily enough, out of the 3 that ended up getting hired, 2 were recommended internally by other coworkers (we have a referral bonus to incentivize them + wanted to hire people who have previously worked with someone on the team who can vouch for their skills) and 1 was hired because they cold DM'd the CEO on twitter (with a surprisingly comprehensive memo on how they'd improve our platform and their relevant experience). \n\nSo yeah, 500+ applications only to hire people we already kinda knew.\n\n_If you're getting into CS_: Attend hackathons/conferences, network aggressively during your internships, contribute to popular open-source projects if only to expand your connections, stay in touch with people from your school and former colleagues, hit up your network to reach out if they've a role you'd be a fit for, take initiative and cold DM people. Whatever it takes to build your network and get your foot through the door.\n\n__AI slop has fried the brains of a lot of new grads.__\n\nLook, I like cursor/claude code as much as anybody else and have no shame in admitting it has boosted my productivity a ton. \n\nBut interviewing people has made me _very_ glad I graduated before LLMs took off.\n\nThis is because a lot of candidates were either (a) blatantly cheating during the interview using some sort of AI tool (could tell from their eye movement and/or how they arrived at the correct answer but couldn't justify how they got there at all) OR (b) didn't have the intuition you'd expect from a software engineer who has spent years coding by throwing stuff at the wall and looking things up (\"learning how to learn\").\n\nI'm personally starting to think AI is a net negative for new grads in that it both nerfs your reasoning muscles (unless u know how to use it properly, i.e as a resource to speed up your learning process wrt core concepts, instead of a black box u mindlessly copy + paste from) AND also forces employers to put higher weight on credentialism (prestige of your school/internships/full time jobs/networking) given the rampant amount of cheating it enables during a remote technical interview.\n\nWouldn't be surprised if in-person interviews became the norm again, which is unfortunate because that would reduce the amount of economic mobility available to someone w/o much experience who say went to a no name school and lives in the middle of nowhere.\n\nGood luck!",

        "author": "Broad-Cranberry-9050",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey all,\n\nIm 7 YOE. I have worked in the defense industry my first few years (RTX, Lockheed Martin, BAE, etc), then during the hiring height of 2020-2022 I went to FAANG-level company and spent a few years there in their cloud based system. THis year I got laid off and after a few months I was able to get a job in a big tech cloud based system. I wouldnt consider my current company FAANG level but id say most people would know it. I will pre-face this that it is my experience. Im not saying every project in each industry is like this, I've known people in AWS who claim to not have to do anything past 5 pm and get great reviews and bonuses.  I know people in defense who say they work a shitload of hours to get things done.\n\nHere are some of the differences I've seen from all three jobs:\n\n# Onboarding:\n\nDefense - didnt really have an onboarding. It was just kind of, build and run the system. I remember they gave me a task to change the headers of a few files just as an excuse to get me to build.\n\nFAANG - they bascially gave me an onboarding doc, that didnt even seem official. It was just a doc that got passed around with steps. I was surpriused nobody had ever took time to put it in a version control style doc system. It was just in the middle of some doc sharing system online.\n\nCurrent: to my surprise their onboarding was the best and most chill. They gave me clear indiciation of where they expect me to be. The first week was just 3 hour courses each day of onboarding for my company. The second week was a self paced class for onboarding for my team. The videos were very instructive, and easy to follow along and my favorite part was they basically gave us guidelines for how to get promoted.\n\n# work life balance:\n\nDefense - probably had the best work life balance of the bunch. I never had to think about work after 5pm. By 6 the building was a ghost town with a few stragglers. They worked on a 9/80 schedule so I had 3 day weekends 2-3 times a month (26 times a year). I could also work for extra PTO, where if I worked extra hours one week I could save it in a \"extra time\" bank and use it as future PTO.\n\nFAANG - definetely the worse of the 3 so far. It was expected ot be available practically 24/7. I went to that FAANG company because I had heard it was one of the few that you coould have a life, but I never realized that cloud was the exception to that rule. People were respodning to emails late at night, getting on calls late, responding on vacation, etc. THey were cool about taking time off but it felt like if you weren't drinking the kool aid and doing 10x more like verybody else was doing, it wouldnt go well for you.\n\nCurrent - still early to tell but it seems that there isnt as much of a \"work late\" culture here. People set their own times, some work a bit later but Ive never seen any crazy discussions happen at 11 pm like I did in my last job. A few principal engineers have gone on vacation and not yet have I seen any of them get on a call or message thread to answer any type of question.\n\n# Expectiations:\n\nDefense - really didnt have much expectations. I practically worked 20 hours, coasted the rest, was my team's scrum master, etc and over excelled in their eyes. There was no real due date on things because contracts in defense last multiple years. I remember when I got there the expectation was to complete the project within my first year. It took 3 years to finish and nobody batted an eye.\n\nFAANG - expectations were very high. If you were finishin up with a major task, theyd throw another one at you before you were even done with the first. Seemed even as aJr/mid-level I was expected to lead meetings, always be available, etc. I worked way more at this job than I did at defense and felt like i was underperforming because if I did 8-10 hours, most others did 10-12 hour days. In reviews it seemed like I was compared to my teammates, not so much compared to what the expectation of the job was.\n\nCurrent - again still early. But seems like their expectations are pretty fair. A quote from the first day I like was \"if you want to be the person that does 40 hour weeks and gets your job done, you can have a long career here. If you want to be the person that does 50+ hour weeks here for that quicker promotion, you can do that but just respect your work-life balance\".\n\n# Time and meetings:\n\nDefense - hardly had any meetings. We did standup evertday (except fridays) for 30 minutes but it mostly lasted 15 minutes. We hardly went over. I never learned the concept of parking lot until I got to FAANG lol. It was in office so just walking to someone's desk was really just the norm.\n\nFAANG - seemed like if your day didnt have 4 hours of meetings, you were underperforming. Everything was a discussion. Parking lot would take an extra hour and most of it was discussing things that I felt didnt really have to take that long. At times some of my tasks were pushed back due to someone wanting to discuss about one simple change. If you had to talk to someone, it was hard to get them on a call and when you did they didnt appreciate their time being wasted. In meetings it seemed everyone was stressed to have the meeting finish.\n\nCurrent - seems nobody is really stressed about meetings. Parking lot items get resolved pretty quickly. Everybody doesn't mind hopping on a call and lasting an hour with you.\n\nEdit: someone asked for interview styles. I wont give exact details but ill say more or less how it was.\n\n# Interview:\n\nDefense: I was a college grad so I got invited to an all day hriing event by the company. It seemed like the interviews didnt ask anything technical, they jsut wanted to get ot know me. At the end of the day they had me list my favorite teams and told me theyd let me know. I've interviewed for other defense companies, tbh there were no leetcode questions or anything like that. Technical questions were more like \"what is OOP?\" or how I would design a simple code.\n\nFAANG - first was a pre-round codesignal style question to see if I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that I went through 2-3 rounds of interviews asking leetcode style questions and then a manager meet.\n\nBig tech - similar to faang. Pre-interview exam to make sure I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that it was 2-3 rounds of code/system questions.\n\nEdit 2: people asked about TC\n\n# TC\n\n\\- Defense: as a college grad in a HCOL state I started at about 78k wiht a 5k bonus. Within 4 years and 1 promotion I was making 90k and yearly bonuses that was around 5k-8k.  No stock. I know people who jumped to other defense company and they are around 120k. Promotion seemed like it happened every 2-3 years.\n\n\\- FAANG - I never got promoted in my few years though I doubt I deserved it in their eyes. I never really saw anybody get promoted really. Like one mid level SWE had been working more than most seniors and she didnt get promoted. AS for TC it was about 220k between base stocks and signing bonus. I moved to a low COL state shortly after joining and my base pay dropped by 20k so it ended up being around 200k\n\n\\- Current company - TC is about 200k with just basepay and stock (no signing bonus) but according to them, im promised up to 10% bonus that would bring my total pay to around 215k.\n\n# Benefits\n\n\\- Defense: 3 weeks of accrued PTO. But since there was timsheet we technically were not allowed to do overtime. A work around was if I worked 90 hours in a 2 week period, I could use 10 hours and save it in a special bank that I could use later on. So If in a 4 week period I worked 200 hours, I could set 40 hours to that special bank. And if I had a 2week vacation I could use the special bank for the first week and my regular PTO for the second week. It was good benefits outside of that, tuition reimbursement which I used to get my master's degree without taking on more debt. Discounts on personal travel (it wasnt amazing but good enough) etc.\n\n\\- FAANG - Unlimited PTO. Some of the best benefits i've ever seen will probably will ever have. There were multiple different types of reimbursement programs for almost anything. Discount codes on almost any store that were actually pretty good discounts. Similar benefits when it comes to tuition reimbursement, etc.\n\n\\- Big tech - unlimited PTO. Again good benefits, just not as good as FAANG. Company will give random 3 day weekends to employees that they announce pretty early so people have it prepared.",

        "content": "I work in a team where the majority of devs are contractors from India, except for me (I’m based in LATAM) and the lead developer who’s in the US. I’m the most recent dev to join the team.\n\nAt the beginning, I noticed people didn’t offer opinions when the lead dev spoke, and I assumed it was fear. This guy curses during dev meetings when he sees weird stuff (usually some weird requirement from product), so I thought everyone was just intimidated.\n\nBut as time went on, I realized the lead dev isn’t an ogre, he just lacks social skills. And honestly, I think there’s a lack of trust in the contractors. These guys, they do the bare minimum. Clean code practices is like an alien concept. Magic numbers in conditionals, functions scattered all over the place, no deletion of unused code, functions names not describing what they do. It’s a mess. Something that should take a day takes three, just because you have to go through the messy code or refactor first, which I think it’s only me who does it anyways.\n\nI’ve mentioned my concerns like the usage of magic numbers and only the lead dev reacts. The rest stay silent. They rarely answer questions unless I tag them in the message. It feels like they’re just taking advantage of the fact that the lead dev is a workaholic who works weekends and oversees everything. I get just doing your job and collecting paychecks, but I can’t understand this level of laziness. It’s crazy.\n\nI want to push more for clean code practices, but I don’t want to create an uncomfortable situation for anybody, specially if things seem to be working out they way things are now. The lead dev does care, but he’s got too much on his plate and is focused on shipping. He’s the only one reviewing PRs, I understand why he may let things slide. If I’m going to start reviewing PRs and putting more time into raising the quality bar, I want to make sure management sees it.\n\nOn one hand, I’d love to just keep things chill and cash my check. On the other, it’s frustrating working in this mess and seeing the laziness. Not sure how to move forward. Anyone been in a similar spot?",

Honestly have had suicidal thoughts.\n\nThis is my [latest resume](https://imgur.com/a/HdaoSeV)  (Edit: [new version after reading comments](https://imgur.com/a/G2DnL10) ) . Not really sure what skills to add next. At the same time, I don't really want to work on any more projects. I'm tired of it and my parents get mad at me when I spend my time on projects instead of applying. Should I keep working on projects? I'd like to replace the C++ one if I could\n\nI don't see why anyone would hire me. Apparently, the market is crowded with experienced devs, so why hire me? Don't even have internships just projects.\n\nEdit:  The \"experience\" on my resume is just doing some frontend + figma training for my friend's one-man company btw\n\nEdit: Am American citizen. Applying anywhere within the US. Full stack or frontend web dev",

I dont fear that AI is gonna take my future job but rather mutate it into something that I don't enjoy anymore. Even though I am of the opinion that AI generates crappy software, I also feel like tech companies do not care about the quality of their software and will push towards a \"vibe coding\" development process simply because it's cheaper and faster.\n\nI fear that working in software will end up being up wirtting LLM prompts, writting design specifications and debugging AI slop. The prospect of this makes me want to pivot away from software since it takes all the joy away from the profession.\n\nI have dedicated so much time to this field and will probably continue working as a hobbyist and contribute to open source. BUT, what am I supposed to do career wise? Where could I pivot to without losing all rhe skills I have learned? Am I overreacting and software development won't change that much? I really don't know what to do.",

I was able to get a pretty prestigious publication and had a great time actually contributing to undergrad research. However, I *really* don’t want to work in SWE. I’m very money-driven and don’t see eye-to-eye with the general academic mission (I also despised teaching and kind of hated school, I also found no lecturers I really connected with). \n\nAt this point, I’m about 90% sure I want to abandon any SWE dreams I once had an unshelf my high school aspirations to become an attorney. I have taken the LSAT and got a recent enough score to go to a T30 law school. What do you guys think? Is it time to “abandon all hope, ye who enter here?”\n\n**Edit: I guess should be more clear with my questions: is all hope lost for me? Are my feelings that I need to go to law school to have a successful career, and sticking with SWE would lead to no success, valid?**\n\n**TL;DR: No success with internships. Some success in research and school. Should I give up with SWE?**",

In the weekends, i just want to lie down, do nothing and spend time with my family.\n\nI see other developers working relentlessly, always trying to stay up to date in their spare time, learn about frameworks, be a constant \"yes\" man and put up with their managers' bs, work in the weekends.\n\nAnd here I am, just want to complete my tasks, collect paychecks, have a life. It's not like I do not want to improve, I truly do. But I don't have the energy.

I have extensive experiencing in programming and launching products, but I am fed up with it.\n\nHas anyone else reached this point and switched careers? Any advice on something I could switch to where I wouldn't have to start over from scratch? \n\nI am reasonably intelligent, I suppose. I am a people person. I am tech-minded and feel like I would be good in a consulting-type role. I really want to avoid any programming, product manager, or program manager role, and I want to avoid more specialized tech roles like a security engineer where I'd feel even more isolated.\n\nIf anyone has personal experience or advice they'd like to share, I would greatly appreciate it.

I have been working extremely hard grinding leetcode, focusing on personal projects, and practicing interviews. I applied to at least 500 jobs and only got called for an interview from 6. Even when my interviews went well, there was always someone better in their eyes. I went to college in a different part of the country, so I don't really have access to those resources anymore. \n\nWorst part is how recruiters react when they hear I've been unemployed for 7 months: they either scoff and outright ghost. These all have been taking an extreme toll on my mental health. I've had a few resume reviews 4-5 months ago and all I got were \"it's not you but the current market or \"your profile is extremely strong, keep applying\" but it's only gone downhill from there. I had 4 internships at prestigious companies and all ended with excellent final reports but no return offers due to budget cuts. \n\nI'm sending cold messages on LinkedIn constantly but no one responds anymore. All my friends have started ghosting me as well so I can't ask for referrals from them. I can't express how depressed I've been watching all of my peers working at FAANG while I'll be happy to just take any SWE/ML job. I'm happy for them but also upset as I have no idea how to get help. \n\nThe last call I got from a recruiter, she outright asked me why I don't have a job yet in an extremely condescending manner although that requisition was for someone who graduated within the last year.\nI'm also a US citizen, so I don't think immigration/visa issues are relevant.\n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. If anyone has tips on expanding my network, getting referrals, or anything really, I'd really appreciate it.\n\nTldr; 7 months since graduation and no prospects of new grad roles. Losing all hopes and mental health is in the gutter. Would appreciate advice on building network or anything that'll get me out of this deep pit. ",

Liquid comp would be slightly lower, but there’s big upside in equity… if they succeed it would be better than the current job, if they corner the European market it could be life-changing. \n\nI'm afraid of overvaluing the equity or minimizing the stress of working at a start up in my late 30s, and I don't want to burn bridges and then burn out to later be forced to take a worse job than I have now. Also while I am personally confident they are positioned to do well and believe them when they say they have no plans on getting acquired, there's no guarantee of the equity becoming liquid or ultimately being worth much.\n\nPersonal considerations:I have a mortgage, some debt, and family plans, so stability matters. At the same time, I feel a bit stuck where I am and like the idea of working on something bold. Also the idea of getting a huge payoff is obviously attractive.\n\nAny advice or different points of view would be appreciated!",

The only other work experience I have was an internship last summer where I built automation tools in Python, but not specifically SWE. \n\nI’ve also included some personal and academic backend projects on my resume, but that doesn’t seem to be enough so far to get traction for software engineering roles.\n\nUltimately, I want to pivot into a backend engineering role, where I can focus more on building systems and writing software. I'm grateful for the opportunity I have, but I’m trying to plan out my next steps so I can move in the direction I actually want. From what I've heard, there are no pivot opportunities into dev teams internally as those teams are now offshore. \n\nCoincidentally, I am also starting an online, part-time CS masters degree in the Fall. Given how the market is, and since I've had no real work experience in backend, would it be better to apply to internships or full-time roles? ",

I have developed a love for CS theory, specifically in anything related to reducing latency and increasing throughput. For example, distributed systems, compilers, parallel computing, high-performance computing, DSA, core OS, DB internals, CPU architecture.\n\nI'm going to be working at Meta as a SWE. Even though I'm joining at E3, I have heard many horror stories of the WLB at Meta so I already have the expectation that I will be working 50 hours per week. Hell, I have seen posts on here that might be exaggerating, but people are claiming to be working 60+ hours per week at Meta. I haven't been team matched yet since they're doing bootcamp this year for E3.\n\nWith that being said, I have done some quick back-of-the-envelope calculations and I believe if I pursue a Master's part-time, I will only have 15 hours left in my week in total for leisure (e.g. girlfriend, gym, hobbies unrelated to CS). Also, this might put a strain on my performance at work and promo speed, which is very important to me. Moreover, if I focus on work and promo speed, depending on what team I am on I am thinking since I'm in big tech where scale matters, I might already be learning about distributed systems, compilers, and the rest of my interests on the job itself without having to do a Master's. I would lose the actual credential of a Master's degree but I would probably (hopefully) have more impact, greater performance and bonus, less risk of layoff, faster promo speed, etc. at work to offset this. Furthermore, I would use 3-4 years of my early/mid 20s on further schooling, but I'm also not the type to want to party hard all night long or something like that.\n\nHowever, I also see some benefits. For one, I will only pay a total of like $2000 for the entire Master's program. Meta will cover the rest. It's GaTech's OMSCS. Additionally, when I am older, I think it might be fun to become a sessional instructor at my undergrad, which requires a grad degree. I also did some research in undergrad, and I feel like doing a Master's program might potentially open up more opportunities for research in the future. On that note, I'm also interested in the opportunity that this might open up to move into quant dev (not quant trader, researcher, analyst, or any of the \"true quant roles\"). My areas of interest are related to quant dev I believe, and I personally find finance very interesting so I think it might be a good fit. But I also don't think that GaTech OMSCS is a target program for quant firms, so regardless of whether I pursue this or not that door might just be closed.\n\nTL;DR: should I do Master's if I already have big tech full-time job lined up? Cons is mostly time commitment which might strain work performance.

        "content": "I'm currently in my last semester at community college and will be transferring to a four year school in this spring. My major is cs, but I’ve been seriously considering switching to either data science/computer engineering/electrical engineering once I transfer or maybe just sticking with cs.\n\nI've come to a realization that programming and web development haven’t really clicked with me or at least that's not what I'm particularly interested in/to do once i graduate. On the other hand, I’ve found myself enjoying classes like calculus, physics, discrete structures, and fundamentals of computer systems, etc a lot more. The two remaining classes in my last sem besides general/electives are software development and data structures so I’m hoping that gives me more clarity but right now I feel kind of lost and unsure about which direction to take.\n\nIf anyone’s been in a similar situation or has advice on choosing between CS, CE, DS and EE (especially for someone who enjoys the math/theory/structure side more than coding), I’d really appreciate your input.",

        "content": "Hello!\n\nI apologize if this is only tangentially related to CS and this might be a mini-rant. I'm a Senior Software Engineer and I make about $130k. I work remote and my day-to-day is usually about 2-3 hours of development and half an hour of code reviews. I often take days off and I don't work on most Fridays. \n\nWhile this is a very comfortable situation, I feel very unfulfilled. The obvious, (to me), solution would be to use all my down time to have a side-project but I tried working on a solo app or a game or thinking of my own business. None of these make me happy and I just feel bored of most things. I usually leave the house and walk around the mall just to do something with my day because I have nothing else to do.\n\nWhile I am a critical part of the team, my company is getting more and more manager-based and I'm no longer being asked for architecture input, but I am still being relied upon for development tasks. I have spoken about this to a couple of managers, and while they seem like they understand, I haven't seen any change in this. This isn't a huge deal-breaker and I think I'm looking for _any_ change in order to be less bored.\n\nWhile I think that my feelings are caused by me being idle, I also think what would happen if I wasn't. I don't think I would be any happier if I was busy, and I think I need a complete career change. What is scary to me is that I would need to find something with a comparable salary. I have been looking passively looking looking for another job in my field, (about 5-10 applications every 2 months), but I have only had 2 interviews in 2 years. Maybe I would have more luck if I searched for something in an entirely different field? But would that job also let me work remote and be mostly unsupervised?\n\nI apologize if my situation would be somebody's \"dream job\", and I don't want to sound ungrateful. If somebody else has been in a similar position, I would love to know if they have a solution.",
