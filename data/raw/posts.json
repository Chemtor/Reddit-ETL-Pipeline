Since I noticed a lot of outdated info online, thought I’d share how the process looked for me and what concepts are worth preparing. Hopefully this helps someone grinding through prep.\n\n**Process Overview**  \n**Recruiter Screen (30 min)**  \nRole fit + background discussion.  \nOne or two simple SQL/Python checks.\n\n**Technical Phone Screens (75 min each)**  \nMostly SQL and Python/ETL.  \nNot just solving, but also follow-ups on query optimization and edge cases.  \nEach screen also tested one Leadership Principle (LP) (mine were Dive Deep and Deliver Results).\n\n**Onsite / Virtual Loop (3–5 rounds, 60 min each)**  \nSQL Deep Dive → joins, windows, Top-K, rolling averages.  \nCoding / ETL Design → handling messy/late data, retries, streaming vs batch.  \nData Modeling → fact/dim schema, partitions, SCDs, trade-offs in Redshift/S3/Spark.  \nManager + Bar Raiser → critical rounds. Heavy mix of technical judgment + LPs. These carry a lot of weight in the final decision.\n\nLPs are central across all rounds. Prep STAR stories for Dive Deep, Deliver Results, Insist on Highest Standards, Are Right A Lot, Customer Obsession.\n\n**Concepts / Questions to Prepare**  \n**SQL**  \nWindow functions (ROW\\_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD).  \nComplex joins, CTEs, subqueries.  \nAggregations + grouping, rolling averages, time-based calcs.  \nGrowth/churn queries (YoY, MoM).\n\n**Python / ETL**  \nFlattening nested JSON/lists.  \nReal-time sliding window averages. Deduplication by key + timestamp.  \nBatch pipeline design with late data handling.\n\n**Data Modeling**  \nOrders/transactions schema with fact/dim and SCD for Prime status.  \nClickstream/session schema with partitions.  \nStar vs snowflake schema, warehouse trade-offs.\n\n**Leadership Principles (LPs)**  \nDive Deep: Debugging a broken pipeline under pressure.  \nDeliver Results: Handling a P0 deadline.  \nHighest Standards: Raising quality standards despite deadlines.  \nInvent & Simplify: Automating repetitive workflows.\n\n**My Takeaways**  \nAmazon DE evaluations are 50% technical and 50% LPs.  \nSQL/Python prep is not enough — LP storytelling is equally important.  \nManager + Bar Raiser rounds are the toughest and usually decide the outcome.\n\nThat’s my experience. If you’re preparing, don’t underestimate the LP side of it — it’s just as important as SQL/Python. Good luck to anyone with the process coming up\n\nTC : 261.5K\n\nBase : 171k\n\nRSUS : 190K\n\nSign on bonus year 1 : 81k\n\nSign on bonus year 2 : 60K\n\n\n\n\\#Amazon #DataEngineer #DataEngineering #BigData #SQL #Python #AWS #ETL #CareerGrowth",

I'm trying to get rid of it wherever I see it/Have the chance to.\n\nPerformance-wise, I don't think it is crazy. If you're dealing with BigData, you should be using other frameworks to handle the load, and if you're not, I think that regular Python (especially now that we're at 3.13 and a lot of FP features have been added to it) is already very efficient.\n\nUsage-Wise, this is where I hate it.\n\nIt's needlessly complex and overengineered. Honestly, when working with Spark or Beam, the API is super easy to understand and it's also very easy to get the basic block/model of the framework and how to build upon it. \n\nPandas DataFrame on the other hand is so ridiculously complex that I feel I'm constantly reading about it without grasping how it works. Maybe that's on me, but I just don't feel it is intuitive. The basic functionality is super barebones, so you have to configure/transform a bunch of things.\n\nToday I was working on migrating/scaling what should have been a quick app to fetch some JSON data from an API and instead of just being a simple parsing of a python dict and writing a JSON file with sanitized data, I had to do like 5 transforms to: normalize the json, get rid of invalid json values like NaN, make it so that every line actually represents one row, re-set missing columns for schema consistency, rename columns to get rid of invalid dot notation.\n\nIt just felt like so much work, I ended up scraping Pandas altogether and just building a function to recursively traverse and sanitize a dict and it worked just as well.\n\nI know at the end of the day it's probably just me not being super sharp on Pandas theory, but it just feels like a bloat at this point",

        "author": "Motor_Crew7918",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering \n\nI recently open-sourced a high-performance Hash Join implementation in C++ called flash\\_hash\\_join. In my benchmarks, it shows exceptional performance in both single-threaded and multi-threaded scenarios, running up to **2x faster** than DuckDB, one of the top-tier vectorized engines out there.\n\n**GitHub Repo:** [**https://github.com/conanhujinming/flash\\_hash\\_join**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fconanhujinming%2Fflash_hash_join)\n\nThis post isn't a simple tutorial. I want to do a deep dive into the optimization techniques I used to squeeze every last drop of performance out of the CPU, along with the lessons I learned along the way. The core philosophy is simple: align software behavior with the physical characteristics of the hardware.\n\n# Macro-Architecture: Unpartitioned vs. Radix-Partitioned\n\nThe first major decision in designing a parallel hash join is how to organize data for concurrent processing.\n\nThe industry-standard approach is the **Radix-Partitioned Hash Join**. It uses the high-order bits of a key's hash to pre-partition data into independent buckets, which are then processed in parallel by different threads. It's a \"divide and conquer\" strategy that avoids locking. DuckDB uses this architecture.\n\nHowever, a fantastic paper from TUM in SIGMOD 2021 showed that on modern multi-core CPUs, a well-designed **Unpartitioned** concurrent hash table can often outperform its Radix-Partitioned counterpart.\n\nThe reason is that Radix Partitioning has its own overhead:\n\n1. **Materialization Cost**: It requires an extra pass over the data to compute hashes and write tuples into various partition buffers, consuming significant memory bandwidth.\n2. **Skew Vulnerability**: A non-ideal hash function or skewed data can lead to some partitions becoming much larger than others, creating a bottleneck and ruining load balancing.\n\nI implemented and tested both approaches, and my results confirmed the paper's findings: **the Unpartitioned design was indeed faster**. It eliminates the partitioning pass, allowing all threads to directly build and probe a single shared, thread-safe hash table, leading to higher overall CPU and memory efficiency.\n\n# Micro-Implementation: A Hash Table Built for Speed\n\nWith the Unpartitioned architecture chosen, the next challenge was to design an extremely fast, thread-safe hash table. My implementation is a fusion of the following techniques:\n\n**1. The Core Algorithm: Linear Probing**  \nThis is the foundation of performance. Unlike chaining, which resolves collisions by chasing pointers, linear probing stores all data in a single, contiguous array. On a collision, it simply checks the next adjacent slot. This memory access pattern is incredibly cache-friendly and maximizes the benefits of CPU prefetching.\n\n**2. Concurrency: Shard Locks + CAS**  \nTo allow safe concurrent access, a single global lock would serialize execution. My solution is **Shard Locking** (or Striped Locking). Instead of one big lock, I create an array of many smaller locks (e.g., 2048). A thread selects a lock based on the key's hash: lock\\_array\\[hash(key) % 2048\\]. Contention only occurs when threads happen to touch keys that hash to the same lock, enabling massive concurrency.\n\n**3. Memory Management: The Arena Allocator**  \nThe build-side hash table in a join has a critical property: **it's append-only**. Once the build phase is done, it becomes a read-only structure. This allows for an extremely efficient memory allocation strategy: the **Arena Allocator**. I request a huge block of memory from the OS once, and subsequent allocations are nearly free—just a simple pointer bump. This completely eliminates malloc overhead and memory fragmentation.\n\n**4. The Key Optimization: 8-bit Tag Array**  \nA potential issue with linear probing is that even after finding a matching hash, you still need to perform a full (e.g., 64-bit) key comparison to be sure. To mitigate this, I use a parallel tag array of uint8\\_ts. When inserting, I store the low 8 bits of the hash in the tag array. During probing, the check becomes a two-step process: first, check the cheap 1-byte tag. Only if the tag matches do I proceed with the expensive full key comparison. Since a single cache line can hold 64 tags, this step filters out the vast majority of non-matching slots at incredible speed.\n\n**5. Hiding Latency: Software Prefetching**  \nThe probe phase is characterized by random memory access, a primary source of cache misses. To combat this, I use **Software Prefetching**. The idea is to \"tell\" the CPU to start loading data that will be needed in the near future. As I process key i in a batch, I issue a prefetch instruction for the memory location that key i+N (where N is a prefetch distance like 4 or 8) is likely to access:  \n\\_mm\\_prefetch((void\\*)&table\\[hash(keys\\[i+N\\])\\], \\_MM\\_HINT\\_T0);  \nWhile the CPU is busy with the current key, the memory controller works in the background to pull the future data into the cache. By the time we get to key i+N, the data is often already there, effectively hiding main memory latency.\n\n**6. The Final Kick: Hardware-Accelerated Hashing**  \nInstead of a generic library like xxhash, I used a function that leverages hardware instructions:\n\n    uint64_t hash32(uint32_t key, uint32_t seed) {\n        uint64_t k = 0x8648DBDB;\n        uint32_t crc = _mm_crc32_u32(seed, key);\n        return crc * ((k << 32) + 1);\n    }\n\nThe \\_mm\\_crc32\\_u32 is an **Intel SSE4.2 hardware instruction**. It's absurdly fast, executing in just a few clock cycles. While its collision properties are theoretically slightly worse than xxhash, for the purposes of a hash join, the raw speed advantage is overwhelming.\n\n# The Road Not Taken: Optimizations That Didn't Work\n\nNot all good ideas survive contact with a benchmark. Here are a few \"great\" optimizations that I ended up abandoning because they actually hurt performance.\n\n* **SIMD Probing**: I tried using AVX2 to probe 8 keys in parallel. However, hash probing is the definition of random memory access. The expensive **Gather** operations required to load disparate data into SIMD registers completely negated any computational speedup. SIMD excels with contiguous data, which is the opposite of what's happening here.\n* **Bloom Filters**: A bloom filter is great for quickly filtering out probe keys that definitely don't exist in the build table. This is a huge win in **low-hit-rate** scenarios. My benchmark, however, had a high hit rate, meaning most keys found a match. The bloom filter couldn't filter much, so it just became pure overhead—every key paid the cost of an extra hash and memory lookup for no benefit.\n* **Grouped Probing**: This technique involves grouping probe keys by their hash value to improve cache locality. However, the \"grouping\" step itself requires an extra pass over the data. In my implementation, where memory access was already heavily optimized with linear probing and prefetching, the cost of this extra pass outweighed the marginal cache benefits it provided.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe performance of flash\\_hash\\_join doesn't come from a single silver bullet. It's the result of a combination of synergistic design choices:\n\n* **Architecture**: Choosing the more modern, lower-overhead Unpartitioned model.\n* **Algorithm**: Using cache-friendly Linear Probing.\n* **Concurrency**: Minimizing contention with Shard Locks.\n* **Memory**: Managing allocation with an Arena and hiding latency with Software Prefetching.\n* **Details**: Squeezing performance with tag arrays and hardware-accelerated hashing.\n\nMost importantly, this entire process was **driven by relentless benchmarking**. This allowed me to quantify the impact of every change and be ruthless about cutting out \"optimizations\" that were beautiful in theory but useless in practice.\n\nI hope sharing my experience was insightful. If you're interested in the details, I'd love to discuss them here.\n\nNote: my implementation is mainly insipred by this excellent blog: [https://cedardb.com/blog/simple\\_efficient\\_hash\\_tables/](https://cedardb.com/blog/simple_efficient_hash_tables/)",

They have a historical data ingest tool that was designed for database to database change capture with other things bolted on. It's not a good fit for the current main product. \n\nThey have *another* internal python tool that a previous dev wrote to do the same thing (S3 CSV or flat file etc -> write to PG db).

It seems every job I reach a point every year or two where motivation drops and I just don't care anymore. Performance begins to drop. When the going gets real hard I go get another job, I have climbed up to a senior role now. Fortunately this employment history of two years per organization seems to be acceptable.\n\nProblem is I am here again. Have been interviewing for roles and trying to get excited again about new projects. Interviewing for some lead roles and already have an offer to lead migration from DBT to a streaming setup. But I wonder if I'm setting myself up for failure. I do enjoy technical challenges but I do sort of feel like I am only using one side of my brain as a data engineer.\n\nAm I just burnt out and maybe need a break? I feel like even with a break the same thing would eventually come back. I don't currently have a stressful job, for example I work about 30 hours a week maybe I need to find value from other parts of life.\n\nI am also looking at going back to school for a master's to pick up some skills that would allow me to maybe work on more interesting projects (don't have the CS or engineering undergrad background, would maybe be cool to explore other technical subjects) Not thinking I'd suddenly become a game developer but I love to tinker and maybe having more fundamentals would allow me to get a personal project off the ground to the point where that could be a full-time job. I would love to have more product-focused SWE skills versus just being able to migrate DBT models to Databricks. But the downside is becoming a poor student again when I already have a career, maybe just not the one I want.\n\nAnyone who has done DE type work for longer able to comment? Are these types of low points normal, or a hint I should try to continue to find something else?",

It's fast for a one-off change, but it's a recipe for disaster. It's not auditable, not easily repeatable across environments, and becomes a huge mess as the team grows.\n\nWe adopted a strict Infrastructure as Code (IaC) model for this using Terraform. I wrote a blog post that breaks down our exact blueprint. If you're still managing your DWH by hand or looking for a more structured way to do it, the post might give you some useful ideas.\n\nFull article here: [https://blueprintdata.xyz/blog/modern-data-stack-iac-with-terraform](https://blueprintdata.xyz/blog/modern-data-stack-iac-with-terraform) \n\nCurious to hear how other teams are handling this.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm working on optimizing joins between two very large tables (hundreds of millions of records each) in a data lake environment. I know that bucketing and Z-ordering are two popular techniques for improving join performance by reducing data shuffling, but I'm trying to understand which is the better choice in practice.\n\nBased on my research, here’s a quick summary of my understanding:\n\n* **Bucketing** uses a hash function on the join key to pre-sort data into a fixed number of buckets. It's great for equality joins but can lead to small files if not managed well. It also doesn't work with Delta Lake, as I understand.\n* **Z-Ordering** uses a space-filling curve to cluster similar data together, which helps with data skipping and, by extension, joins. It’s more flexible, works with multiple columns, and helps with file sizing via the `OPTIMIZE` command.\n\nMy main use case is joining these two tables on a single high-cardinality `customer_id` column.\n\nGiven this, I have a few questions for the community:\n\n1. For a simple, high-cardinality equality join, is Z-ordering as effective as bucketing?\n2. Are there scenarios where bucketing would still outperform Z-ordering, even if you have to manage the small file problem?\n3. What are some of the key practical considerations you've run into when choosing between these two methods for large-scale joins?\n\nI'm looking for real-world experiences and insights beyond the documentation.

My goal is to keep things cohesive and easy to manage, especially for changes like adding a new column (e.g., last\\_name to a client table).\n\nCurrent setup:\n\n* DAGs: Stored in a Git repo (Azure DevOps) and synced to Airflow.\n* PySpark notebooks: Stored in Databricks Workspace, synced to Git via Databricks Repos.\n* Configs: Stored in Delta Lake tables in Databricks.\n\nThis feels a bit fragmented since I'm managing code in two environments (Git for DAGs, Databricks for notebooks). For example, adding a new column requires updating a notebook in Databricks and sometimes a DAG in Git.\n\nHow should I organize these Python files for a streamlined workflow? Should I keep both DAGs and notebooks in a single Git repo for consistency? Or is there a better approach (e.g., DBFS, Azure Blob Storage)?

What I then did is to create master data views for each business object (customers, parts, suppliers, employees, bills of materials, ...)\n\n5. I have around 20 scalar-valued functions that return \"Empty\", \"Valid\", \"InvalidPlaceholder\", \"InvalidFormat\", among others when being called with an Input (e.g. a website, mail, name, IBAN, BIC, taxnumbers, and some internal logic). At the end of the post, there is an example of one of these functions.\n\n6. Each master data view with some data object to evaluate calls one or more of these functions and writes the result in a new column on the view itself (e.g. \"dq\\_validity\\_website\").\n\n7. These views get loaded into PowerBI for data owners that can check on the quality of their data.\n\n8. I experimented with something like a score that aggregates all 500 or what columns with \"dq\\_validity\" in the data warehouse. This is a stored procedure that writes the results of all these functions with a timestamp every day into a table to display in PBI as well (in order to have some idea whether data quality improves or not).\n\n  \n\n\n\\-----\n\nExample Function \"Website\":\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nSET ANSI\\_NULLS ON\n\nSET QUOTED\\_IDENTIFIER ON\n\n\n\n/\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFunction: \\[bpu\\].\\[fn\\_IsValidWebsite\\]\n\nPurpose: Validates a website URL using basic pattern checks.\n\nReturns: VARCHAR(30) – 'Valid', 'Empty', 'InvalidFormat', or 'InvalidPlaceholder'\n\nLimitations: SQL Server doesn't support full regex.

        "content": "Hello folks,\n\n  \nI'm a data engineer at a tech company in Norway. We have terabytes of operational data, coming mostly from IoT devices (all internal, nothing 3rd-party dependent). Analytics and Operational departments consume this data which is - mostly - stored in Postgres and MySQL databases in AWS. \n\n  \nTale as old as time: what served really well for the past years, now is starting to slow down (queries that timeout, band-aid solutions made by the developer team to speed up queries, complex management of resources in AWS, etc). Given that the company is doing quite well and we are expanding our client base a lot, there's a need to have a more modern (or at least better-performant) architecture to serve our data needs.\n\n  \nSince no one was really familiar with modern data platforms, they hired only me (I'll be responsible for devising our modernization strategy and mapping the needed skillset for further hires - which I hope happens soon :D )\n\n  \nMy strategy is to pick one (or a few) use cases and showcase the value that having our data in Snowflake would bring to the company. Thus, I'm working on a PoC migration strategy (Important note: the management is already convinced that migration is probably a good idea - so this is more a discussion on strategy).\n\n  \nMy current plan is to migrate a few of our staging postgres/mysql datatables to s3 as parquet files (using aws dms), and then copy those into Snowflake. Given that I'm the only data engineer atm, I choose Snowflake due to my familiarity with it and due to its simplicity (also the reason I'm not thinking on dealing with Iceberg in external stages and decided to go for Snowflake native format)\n\nMy comments / questions are  \n\\- Any pitfalls that I should be aware when performing a data migration via AWS DMS?  \n\\- Our postgres/mysql datatabases are actually being updated constantly via en event-driven architecture. How much of a problem can that be for the migration process? (The updating is not necessarily only append-operations, but often older rows are modified)  \n\\- Given the point above: does it make much of a difference to use provided instances or serverless for DMS?  \n\\- General advice on how to organize my parquet files system for bullet-proofing for full-scale migration in the future? (Or should I not think about it atm?)  \n\n\nAny insights or comments from similar experiences are welcomed :)\n\n  \n",

I'd prefer it to be general purpose solution for everything (and ditch current setup completely) but also I'd accept it to be a solution only for critical data/calculations.\n\nThe solution should be on-premise and allow Spark computations.\n\nHow to build such a thing? We are currently thinking about Apache Ozone for storage (one baremetal cluster stretched to 3 datacenters, replication factor of 3, rack-aware setup) and 2-3 kubernetes (one for each datacenter) for Spark computations. But I am afraid our cross-datacenter network will be bottleneck. One idea to mitigate that is to force kubernetes Spark to read from Ozone nodes from its own datacenter and reach other dc only when there is no available replica in the datacenter (I have not found a way to do that in Ozone docs).\n\nWhat would you do?",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to get some feedback from people who work with databases and data pipelines regularly.\n\n# The Problem\n\nIn a lot of real-world projects (especially data migrations, warehouse integrations, or working with client-provided dumps), I often receive a set of **database tables with only column names and maybe some sample data — but no ERD, no constraints, no documentation**.\n\nFor example:\n\n* I might get 50–100 tables dumped from SQL Server, Oracle, or MySQL.\n* Columns have names like `cust_id`, `c_id`, `customerID`, `fk_cust` spread across tables.\n* Foreign key constraints are either missing or never set up.\n* Sometimes I also get a CSV or JSON with sample data, but that’s it.\n\nManually figuring out how these tables connect is time-consuming:\n\n* Which `id` in one table maps to which column in another?\n* Which columns are just lookups vs. actual relationships?\n* Which ones are “fake” similarities (like `code` columns that don’t really connect)?\n\nI end up doing a mix of manual joins, searching for overlapping values, and asking business users — but it’s not scalable.\n\n# My Approach (experimental)\n\n1. **Column Name Matching:** Use fuzzy string matching (manually) to catch things like `cust_id` ≈ `customerID`.\n2. **Data Overlap:** Sample distinct values from columns and see if they overlap (e.g., 70% of values in one column appear in another).\n3. **Weighted Confidence:** Combine name similarity + overlap + datatype compatibility into a score (e.g., strong match if name & overlap both high).\n4. **Visualization:** generate a graph view (like a partial ERD) that shows “probable” relationships.\n\nIt’s not 100% accurate, but in testing I can get \\~60–70% of relationships guessed correctly, which is a good starting point before manual validation.\n\n# My Question to You\n\n* How do *you* usually solve this problem today when no documentation or foreign keys exist?\n* Do you rely on scripts, BI tools, schema crawlers, or just manual detective work?\n* If you had such a tool, what features would make it actually useful in your day-to-day (e.g., synonym dictionaries, CSV upload, integration with ERD tools, etc.)?\n* Do you see this as a real pain point, or just an occasional annoyance not worth automating?\n\nI’d really appreciate your insights 🙏 — even if your answer is “we don’t face this problem often.”",

Great for developers, less so for non-tech-savvy users.\n* Arize Phoenix offers enterprise-grade features like statistical drift detection and model health scores.\n\n**Why did I even bother writing this?**\n\nI found a couple of other Reddit posts that have compared AI orchestration platforms, but couldn’t find any list that would go over the exact things I was interested in. The company I work for (SMBish/SMEish?) is looking for something that will make it easier for us to manage multiple LLM subs, without having to build a whole system on our own. Hence, I’ve spent some time trying out the available options and put together a list.\n\n**Platforms**\n\n**nexos.ai**\n\nQuick take: A single page allows me to see things like: token usage, token usage per model, total cost, cost per model, completions, completion rates, completion errors, etc. Another page lets me adjust the guardrails for specific teams and users, as well as share custom Assistants between accounts.\n\n*Pros*\n\n* I can manage teams, set up available language models, fallbacks, add users to the team with role-based access, and create API keys for specific teams.\n* Cost alert messages, so we don’t blow our budget in a week.\n* Built-in sharing allows us to share assistants between different teams/departments.\n* It has an API gateway.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* They seem to be pretty fresh to the market.\n\n**Langfuse**\n\nQuick take: captures every prompt/response pair, latency, and token count. Great support for different languages, SDKs available for Python, Node, and Go.\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Open-source! In theory this should reduce the cost if self-hosted.\n* The A/B testing feature is awesome.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* It’s open-source, so we’ll see how it goes.\n\n**Portkey**\n\nQuick take: API gateway, guardrails, logs and usage metrics, plug-and-play routing. Very robust UI\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Rate-limit controls, auto-retries, pretty good at handling busy hours and heavy traffic.\n* Robust logging features.\n* Dev-centric UI.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Dev-centric UI, some of our non-tech-savvy team members found it rather difficult to navigate.\n\n**Arize Phoenix**\n\nQuick take: Provides drift detection, token-level attribution, model-level health scores. Allows alerts to be integrated into Slack.\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Slack alerts are super convenient.\n* Ability to have both on-premise and externally hosted LLMs.\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Seems to have a fairly steep learning curve. Especially for less technically inclined users.\n\n**Overall**\n\nI feel like for most SMEs/SMBs the lowest entry barrier and by an extension the easiest adoption would mean going with nexos.ai. It’s just all there available out of the box, with the observability, management, and guardrails menu providing the exact feature set we were looking for. \n\nClose second for me is Langfuse due to its open-source nature and good documentation coverage.",

I definitely don't excel in this role, I feel more like I just get by. I like it but definitely don't love it / have a passion for it.\n\nAt this point, I'm heavily considering pivoting into sales of some sort, ideally software. I have good social skills and outgoing personality and people have always told me I'd be good at it. I know Software Sales is a lot less stable, major lay-offs happen from missing 1 month's quota, first couple years I'll be making \\~$80k-$90k and is definitely more of a grind. But in order to excel in Data Science/Engineering I'm going to have to become a math/tech geek, get a masters and dedicate years to learning algorithms/models/technologies and coding languages. It doesn't seem to play to my strengths and kind of lacks excitement and energy imo.\n\n1. Do you see any opportunities for those with data analytics to break into a good sales role/company without sales experience?\n2. Data Science salary seems to top out around $400k, and thats rather far along in a career at top tech firm (I know FAANG pays much more). While, Sales you can be making $200K in 4 years if you are top. Does comp continuously progress from there?\n3. Has anyone made a similar jump and regretted it?\n\nAny words of wisdom or guiding advice would be appreciated.",

Temporal deployment keeps failing, bootloader keeps telling me about a missing environment variable in a secrets file I never specified in extraEnv. I’ve tried v1 and v2 charts, they’re both not working. V2 chart is the worst, the helm template throws an error of an ingressClass config missing at the root of the values file, but the official helm chart doesn’t show an ingressClass config file there.

So that's why I'm reaching out to you - is there something that I'm missing? Maybe it's OK to execute them in ADO Pipeline?\n\n(I know that optimally this should be run somewhere else, like a K8s cluster, but let's say that we don't have access to those resources - that's why I'm opting with just staying in crontab).",

The goal is to process retail sales data (invoices, customers, products) and make it ready for analysis.\n\nHere is what the project does:\n\n* **ETL and analysis:** Extract, transform, and analyze retail data using **pandas**. We also perform **data quality checks** in MySQL to ensure the data is clean and correct.\n* **Pipeline orchestration:** Airflow runs DAGs to automate the workflow.\n* **XCom storage:** Large pandas DataFrames are stored in **MinIO**. Airflow only keeps references, which makes it easier to pass data between tasks.\n* **Database:** MySQL stores metadata and results. It can run init scripts automatically to create tables or seed data.\n* **Metabase :** Used for simple visualization.\n\nYou can check the full project on GitHub:  \n[https://rafo044.github.io/Retailflow/](https://rafo044.github.io/Retailflow/)  \n[https://github.com/Rafo044/Retailflow](https://github.com/Rafo044/Retailflow)\n\nI built this project to explore Airflow, using object storage for XCom, and building ETL pipelines for retail data.\n\nIf you are new to this field like me, I would be happy to work together and share experience while building projects.\n\nI would also like to hear your thoughts.  Any experiences or tips are welcome.\n\n  \nI also prepared a **pipeline diagram** to make the flow easier to understand:\n\n* Pipeline diagram: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5i9f4cz5tbof1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=120abce59461dbb0275d6a29f211318fc28e6da5\n\n",

        "content": "Hi,\n\n\n\nIt’s been a while since I first built this project, but I realized I never shared it here. Since a lot of Fusion developers/report writers spend their days in OTBI, I thought it might be useful.\n\n\n\n**The Problem**\n\n\n\nOracle Fusion doesn’t expose a normal database connection. That means:\n\n• You can’t just plug in DBeaver, DataGrip, or another SQL IDE to explore data\n\n• Writing OTBI SQL means lots of trial-and-error, searching docs, or manually testing queries\n\n• No proper developer experience for ad-hoc queries\n\n\n\n**What I Built**\n\n\n\n**OFJDBC** – a free, open-source **JDBC driver** for Oracle Fusion.\n\n• Works with **DBeaver (and any JDBC client)**\n\n• Lets you write **SQL queries directly against Fusion** (read-only)\n\n• Leverages the Fusion web services API under the hood, but feels like a normal database connection in your IDE\n\n\n\n**Why It Matters**\n\n• You can finally use an **industry-leading SQL IDE (DBeaver)** with Fusion Cloud\n\n• Autocomplete, query history, ER diagrams, formatting, and all the productivity features of a real database client\n\n• Great for **ad-hoc queries, OTBI SQL prototyping, and learning the data model**\n\n• No hacks: just connect with the JDBC driver and start querying\n\n\n\n**Security**\n\n• **Read-only** – can’t change anything in Fusion\n\n• Works with standard Fusion authentication\n\n• You’re only retrieving what you’d normally access through reports/APIs\n\n\n\n**Resources**\n\n• GitHub repo (setup, examples, docs): [OFJDBC on GitHub](https://github.com/krokozyab/ofjdbc/blob/master/README.md)\n\n• 100% free and open-source\n\n\n\nI originally built it to make my own OTBI report development workflow bearable, but if you’ve ever wished Fusion behaved like a normal database inside DBeaver, this might save you a lot of time.\n\n\n\nWould love to hear if others in this community find it useful, or if you’ve tried different approaches.",

Is it decline\n\nThe reason I’m asking is because the latest information I’ve found on the forum was updated two years ago. Back then, Spark was still the mainstream, and I’ve also seen Beam’s adoption rate in the industry declining. Even GCP BigQuery now supports Spark, so learning GCP Dataflow at my internship feels like a skill I might not be able to carry forward. Should I switch to learning Spark instead?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1nh91cc)",

Job hoping does not seem like an option. I've been trying for a year and a half now besides all my background. I managed to get more than 20 interviews, but they all seem to be ghost vacancies because some are active even after a year. I started to ghost interviews and recruiters past two weeks because I can't handle shitty processes anymore with 20+ hours of dedication.\n\nI am not the kind of person that just ask for money. This year I did 3 major projects that impacted the company: saved 20% of cloud costs (\\~30k per year saved). Create a new module ML related that increased our+partners  margins from 2 to 8%  (\\~ 50k year with the potential to get 3x more). Finally refactored some code that removed hidden costs/flaws in a system that relies on data and was supposed to charge partners for everything (more \\~25k). \n\nMost of those are not even 100% DE related projects. I did the same steps to reach a good quality of work in the past 3 companies regarding the DE problems.  It seems to me that most of companies don't need a ultra stack to run and don't even Big Data problems to solve. So just one orchestrator with good data validation, modeling and observability are good enough to keep everyone sleeping well at night. What I mean is that DE doesn't look like a challenge anymore so that's why I've been pivoting to more ML/Finance/backend/infra related projects.\n\nI did all these projects because I wanted, nobody asked or have the guts to push for them. I don't wanna look like the hero here, I did because I enjoy my work and also because I believe this is the way to get  a raise oc. Also other developers/DEs (thanks to all autonomy we have) seems to be in the over engineering hell or dealing with minor fire fights (not deliveryng value at all).\n\nSo I have numbers and impact but now (since beginning of the year) is not a good time for a raise they say. \n\nBut what also worries me is that:\n\nEveryone seems to be hanging and doing nothing. No projects, no follow ups (or shitty ones/same ones for 6 months), nobody in the office as much as they are suposed to be (3x week). There's no ownership at all even from the managers. I start to wonder that even managers are working o  side projects now because of their lack of presence. \n\nIs this a cultural thing here in NL? Or a moment in IT field? Or what else? Everyone seems to be pissed and without purpouse nowadays or just doing less than the basics.\n\nHow could I better navigate through this? Help me with your thoughts please.",

I think that I would prefer data engineering over data science or data analytics, but from my research, I concluded that I would need a master's degree to get into data engineering, while it would be possible to get a data analytics job with a community college degree and a good data portfolio.\n\nIn 2023, I started taking classes for a computer information technology associate's degree at my local community college. \n\nEarlier this year, though, I discovered online university WGU (Western Governors University) has bachelor's and master's degrees in data analytics. The bachelor's degree has a much better focus on data analytics than my community college degrees. The WGU data analytics [master's degree](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-masters-program.html) (MSDA) has a specialization in data engineering, which reawakened my interest in the field. \n\nI've been preparing to start at WGU to earn the [bachelor's in data analytics](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/data-analytics-bachelors-program.html) (BSDA), then enroll in the master's degree with data engineering specialization. Last month, WGU rolled out four degree programs in [Cloud and Network Engineering](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cloud-network-engineering-bachelors-program.html) (General, AWS, Azure, and Cisco specializations). Since then, I've been trying to decide if I would be better off earning one of those degrees (instead of the BSDA) to prepare for the MSDA.\n\nSome of the courses in the **BS in Data Analytics (BSDA)**:\n\n* Data Management (using SQL) (3 courses)\n* Python programming (3 courses), R programming (1 course)\n* Data Wrangling\n* Data Visualization\n* Big Data Foundations\n* Cloud Foundations\n* Machine Learning, Machine Learning DevOps (1 course each)\n* Network and Security - Foundations (only 1 course)\n\nSome of the courses in the **BS in Cloud and Network Engineering (Azure Specialization) (BSCNE)**:\n\n* Network and Security - Foundations (same course as above)\n* Networks (CompTIA Network+)\n* Network and Security Applications (CompTIA Security+)\n* Network Analytics and Troubleshooting\n* Python for IT Automation\n* AI for IT Automation and Security\n* Cloud Platform Solutions\n* Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure and Orchestration\n* Cloud and Network Security Models\n\nBesides Network+ and Security+, I would earn CompTIA A+ and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, Azure Administrator, and Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions certifications in the BSCNE degree. The BSDA degree would give me AWS Cloud Practitioner and a couple of other certifications.\n\nIf you've gotten this far - thank you! Thank you very much! \n\nAlso, I have questions:\n\n1. Would the master's in Data Analytics (Data Engineering specialization) from **WGU** be worth it for a data engineering job seeker?\n2. If so, which WGU bachelor's degree would be better preparation for the data engineering MSDA and a later data engineering role - the bachelor's in Data Analysis, or the bachelor's in Cloud and Network Engineering (Azure or AWS)?",

        "content": "I’m excited to share my latest project: **PyRMap**, a lightweight R-Python bridge designed to make data exchange between R and Python faster and cleaner.\n\n*What it does:*\n\nPyRMap allows R to pass data to Python via memory-mapped files (mmap) for near-zero overhead communication. The workflow is simple:\n\n1. R writes the data to a memory-mapped binary file.\n2. Python reads the data and processes it (even running models).\n3. Results are written back to another memory-mapped file, instantly accessible by R.\n\n*Key advantages over reticulate:*\n\n* ⚡ Performance: As shown in my benchmark, for \\~1.5 GB of data, PyRMap is significantly faster than reticulate – reducing data transfer times by 40%\n\n* 🧹 Clean & maintainable code: Data is passed via shared memory, making the R and Python code more organized and decoupled (check example 8 from here - [https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap/tree/main/example/example\\_8\\_reticulate\\_comparation](https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap/tree/main/example/example_8_reticulate_comparation)). Python runs as a separate process, avoiding some of the overhead reticulate introduces.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhcpmljn1bof1.jpg?width=1270&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0b557ef319ddb8f5ae0d2f3ea2647eb1f69bfe1\n\nCurrent limitations:\n\n* Linux-only\n* Only supports running the entire Python script, not individual function calls.\n* Intermediate results in pipelines are not yet accessible.\n\nPyRMap is also part of a bigger vision: RR, a custom R interpreter written in RPython, which I hope to launch next year.\n\nCheck it out here: [https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap](https://github.com/py39cptCiolacu/pyrmap)\n\nWould you use a tool like this?",

The motivation comes from a mix of frustration with existing systems and curiosity: Traditional databases excel at storing and querying, but they treat reactivity as an afterthought. Systems bolt on triggers, changefeeds, or pub/sub layers — often at the cost of correctness, scalability, or painful race conditions.\n\nSevenDB takes a different path: reactivity is core. We extend the excellent work of DiceDB with new primitives that make subscriptions as fundamental as inserts and updates.\n\n[https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB](https://github.com/sevenDatabase/SevenDB)\n\nI'd love for you guys to have a look at this , design plan is included in the repo , mathematical proofs for determinism and correctness are in progress , would add them soon .\n\nit is far from achieved , i have just made a foundational deterministic harness and made subscriptions fundamental , but the distributed part is still in progress , i am into this full-time , so expect rapid development and iterations",

        "content": "\\*EDIT: Title should be \"not a good **teacher\"**\n\n\n\nI hate to say it but ThePrimeagen is not a good teacher.\n\nI just completed boot.dev's \"Learn the HTTP Protocol in Go\" course taught by ThePrimeagen on YouTube. What I did was to first attempt the course myself, and only when I got stuck did I refer and watch the same chapter and lesson he was at on the video.\n\nIn the video, Prime is taking the entire course in one go, and he was doing it on stream, and I think that was the biggest reason his lesson was not good. He is a content creator, so when he codes, he is saying \"yayayayaya\", or \"boom boom\", and rarely ever explaning what he is doing. There are times when he does, but since this is a course, I did have the expectation he would explain what he is doing. He's basically DrDisrespect with that 'stache and mannerism if you what I mean.\n\nI would attribute this to because he was streaming it. I can tell his viewers are seasoned developers because they would comment about things and he replies. In that sense, Prime wasn't doing a course, he was just programming and talking to other developers of the same level, hence the lack of verbose explanations.\n\nSecondly, while Prime did create this course, what he does in the video is also somewhat different from the course. When programming, there are defintely different ways to do things for sure. But if I go into a lecture and the lecturer doesn't use the textbook that the lesson was built upon, I would be confused too. Especially since I attempted code myself, and only looked at his videos afterwards. Like how he would convert his functions to handle \\[\\]byte instead of string.\n\nThe reason why I'm saying is because I took 3 of Lane's course: \"Learn Go\", \"Build a Blog Aggregator in Go\" and \"Build an AI Agent in Python\". In those videos, Lane explains each line of code he is doing and why. And he also shows us what happens when he doesn't know what to do, i.e. asking Boots etc. His lessons really explains everything well and I can highly recommend courses he designs.\n\nIn Prime's word, I have a skill issue and I'm taking the L. I accept that because if I didn't have a skill issue, I wouldn't be on a learning platform at all. Now the course itself definitely taught me a lot more about HTTP protocols, but after watching 3 other courses by Lane, I was quite dissapointed by the quality of this guided project video that I had to make this post. Maybe Lane will remake this video with him guiding it but I highly doubt so, he's a busy guy and I'm looking forward to the next course he is making.",

        "content": "Tl:dr; I want to create an (ios + android) app that tells when the river has burst so people can evacuate. I’ve little to 0 experience in coding.\n\nSorry, this is going to be long so I divided it into backstory and technical questions:\n\n——Backstory——\n\nI live in a small valley town in Malaysia. That said when it floods, ANNUALLY, it becomes a choke point for people travelling to, from and between cities, suburbs and rural areas.\n\nLast year, while a young couple died trying to feed stranded families with babies in cars, the young wife fatally fell into a storm drain (hidden by deep flood waters). Now, just last week it rained again and people are stranded - and I just heard that three people have died in the span of less than a week due to record level landslides in this region.\n\nLook, everyone knows everyone in this part of the world. So when someone dies, everyone is devastated. And it saddens me that it happens to the those with the best or intentions. \n\nNot to mentions property and income losses. I’m talking those who just bought a car to go to work and now it’s CAKED with silt while some have to spend tens of thousands replacing books, devices and furniture cause they didn’t have time to move their stuff elsewhere. \n\nYou might be thinking why don’t they move their cars uphill or carry your fridge upstairs when it rains? Would you do that every time it rains? It’s a tropical country anyway. Anyway, we can only extrapolate so much. \n\nIf only, we had an app that tells us when a water has reached a certain threshold, people can avoid driving into the valley and move their cars or property to safer place. \n\nAgain I have 0 experience in creating this app and I know that that’s just half the problem. I also need to think about the other half of the device - the flood detection thingy. In highschool I met someone in an invention convention that managed to create a device that sends a text message whenever they detect landslide/earthquake in a zone with an Arduino - so it’s like an early prevention mechanism. I’m thinking of emulating that and placing in select flood prone regions upstream as a gauge to let people flee in times when water rises to a certain threshold. \n\nI realise the ginormous uphill battle there is on this, but if I could just make one family - even if it’s just my family to turn back and not enter the valley when it floods, or move their car uphill or evacuate their home. I’ll sleep more peacefully.\n\n——Technical Questions——\n\nApp: \n1. What courses/topics should I take and learn as basics - and do I need to take this first or learn while developing the app?\n2. What language should I be using? I rather it be a multiplatform app instead of a native one so I charter to both ios and android users.\n3. How ”simple” will this app be? I’m not thinking fancy UIs, just maybe pings and alert when one or more of the flood detection gets activated.\n\nFlood detection:\n1. Is an Arduino enough to build this?\n2. If not, what should the detection be? Is there already an invention that does this?\n\nGeneral:\n- Is this possible? How long will this take me? \n\nNB: I’m gonna fund this entirely on my own and I’ll be doing this on the side on top of my already PACKED work schedule.\n\nObviously my questions are wacked cause I honestly don’t know what to ask. I work in an entirely different field and I always have been stupid in class when it comes to STEM. \n\nThank you in advance.\n",

Go back to C (which I haven't been using since I was studying), build things from scratch - my own grep, database engine, interpreter. \n\nWhich path is more likely to bring back that spark? I need something that's genuinely difficult and rewarding, not just \"different boring.\"\n\n",

        "content": "It's day 4 of the very intense boot camp program school. I knew going into it, it wasn't going to be like an ordinary school where you are the student and you have the teacher you. Which I was fine with. I knew the whole point was to go in person and ask your peers for help and help them as you work through projects. \n\nWe're given a project book with an example that we must recreate to pass. My problem is the materials they give us explain absolutely nothing and make it seem so complicated. The \"teachers\" can't tell you anything about anything you have to figure it out yourself. \n\nI have some background in computer science and basic knowledge of knowing to code frontend with like python, and html. I passed all my exams with high grades and I'm very studious. But right now with how everything is done in this school I'm feeling overwhelmed and way in over my head. \n\nI'm sat at the school for at least 12hrs everyday when possible since the campus is open 24/7 and you set your own schedule, just have to be on time for exams. Yet I've never felt quite so dumb in my life. \n\nI could really use help about now because I'm drowning and understand nothing. \n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: It's the next day and I'm grateful for everyone's advice on my situation. I was definitely feeling stressed and not having a good day yesterday with nothing going quite right. But it's a new day and reading everyone's advice has helped me put things into perspective and calm down. So thank you everyone.\n\nI'm honestly not even going to think about the exam that's today. I'm going to look into vscode like everyone recommended and definitely try to pick at as many brains as possible. \n\nI have messaged about English versions of the pdf files that have the projects for us to do, since I struggle with my second language still. \n\nMy life motto is \"one day or day one?\" So let's keep going. Thank you everyone. \n\n\n\n\n\nEdit2: I have entered the exam and failed within the first 10 minutes because I couldn't login into the exam (if you've done the 42 piscine you'll know what I mean). But I'm not in despair or anything because I stay afterwards and talked to my peers and figured out where I went wrong and what my mistake was. (It was a really small mistake of not subscribing to the event. I registered for the exam, but I didn't subscribe to the event as well prior to the exam beginning.)\n\nI know this isn't the subreddit for 42 (I'm already on that one too). But I do genuinely appreciate everyone's advice, tips and tricks. So I would still love to learn from anyone and everyone (treat me like a 5 year old and let me ask a million why and how questions 😂), that does include my peers at 42. \n\nAfter failing the exam and see who also failed, helped me see who was more on my level and that definitely gave me a lot more confidence to interact with my peers more. \n\nNow I need to figure out how to keep on doing the piscine and not sacrifice my health, because I don't think being glued to a chair for 12hrs is the most healthy thing, nor staring at a screen (I come home with horrible migraines by the end of the day). I want to learn without trying to drown. By the end of the day my brain is fried and I immediately crash out as soon as my head hits my pillow. \n\nSo please do keep giving me advice, whether it's coding related, how to interact with my peers better (I really struggle with it), caring for myself during the time period, absolutely anything. I will listen to those who have more experience than me.\n\n",

It has access to everything on the machine.\n\nM) The graphical interface of a programs made me think that's what programs are. \n\nA) Didn't see the true nature of programs, they consist of instructions to do computations and everything else what we call a graphical shell is merely a conveniences that are provided by Operating System software.\n\nM) I thought that GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is only device that is magically being able to draw 3D graphics.\n\nA) CPU could do the same but just really slow (no real time for demanding games), there's also integrated GPU that's built into \"processor\" but it's generally slower that dedicated ones.\n\nWhen there's no one explaining the computers from the low end to high end of course there's so much stupid assumptions and misconceptions.

Whenever I have done any project, I tend to either use one language and its framework. In the case of Java for example, I use Springboot and Kafka (With some basic bootstrap for the frontend) and JavaFX for the graphic interface.\n\nBut with all of these languages how can I use them for a project? I know python tends to be used for scrypting or for AI integration but I have not delved into that nor I have had the need.\n\nTo those that were in this situation or those that are in it, how do you tend to maximize/add other languages into your project? I do not say this for the sake of making things more difficult, I simply want to find a way in which I can make better projects or find a better value of what I'm learning. I fear that this year it might end up being a year in which I won't be able to do any real advancements because I will have to keep studying keywords, libraries and such instead of making actual projects that get you somewhere.\n\nEDIT: I have to study it because the classes this year demands it, my intention was to mostly stick with one until I feel that I'm more of an expert with it",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey everyone, I’m struggling to enjoy studying. I’m naturally motivated by tangible results, which is why I love coding I can see what I create. But when it comes to other subjects, or even “harder” coding problems, the process itself feels painful.\n\nEven when I break tasks into small problems, if I can’t solve them immediately, my mood collapses. I find it hard to enjoy learning for the sake of learning or the process itself. Most of my motivation is tied to performance and results, I want to change that. I love coding, but lately it feels like I’m running purely on willpower, not actual enjoyment, and it isn’t as satisfying as it used to be.\n\nThis year in school doesn’t help. I have exams in literature, history, and math, which make it hard to focus on coding. I’ve even stopped working on projects because the thought “I must prepare for the exams” hits me like a train and ruins my mood. I absolutely despise literature, and the teacher isn’t making it any easier. On top of that, because of the Ukrainian war, I was forced to move and now need to catch up on multiple subjects because i switched school systems (I never studied Hungarian literature or history so I had start from scratch) and I don’t have a choice I can’t go to university if I don’t pass but the pressure is overwhelming. I'm not particularly good at math and my programming teacher university is 50/50 coding and math and if we are not comfortable with it we better get comfortable asap and I'm scared of math and I'm general school is pushing us hard and I feel overwhelmed. I've been looking for a tutor and asked my parents... Hopefully I can find one soon\nRecently, I had a math test and what devasted me the most is when the teacher put a \"logic\" question I couldn't solve it which is \"supposed to be easy\" which is interesting because it's very similar what I do when the programming teacher gives us a takes to solve, ex: check if this list contains a perfect square\", I started learning math from grade 1 on Khan academy, completely restarting because my foundation is terrible but Its not really enough. The rise of AI shakes my confidence in IT, hearing it might replace coders is making me anxious, if I really picked a good \"future proof\" career, which then makes me think, \"just study AI development\" -> a bunch of others join AI development -> market oversaturated and competition will be high to find a job in the future.\n\nI might be spiraling \n\nMy question: How do you train yourself to enjoy the process of studying, not just the end result? Are there strategies, routines, or mindset shifts that make sitting down and learning inherently satisfying, even when the material isn’t naturally interesting and what would you do in my situation to \"get things in order\" I feel lost \n\nI really want to rewire how I approach studying and actually enjoy the process of creating and learning again.",

At first I thought it was just a puzzle game with logic gates… but it turned out to be much more. It gave me a hands-on understanding of logic gates, memory, and even simple CPU design. Hats off to devs for making something so educational yet so enjoyable.\n\nThe game gradually pushes you from simple combinatorial circuits, to memory, to registers and to building a working CPU (LC-3 style) with your own instruction set. By the end you’re basically writing assembly for a custom ISA that you designed yourself.\n\nI’m not a computer engineer by training, but the concepts I picked up while playing \\[logic gates, adders, memory, instruction cycles and more\\] have been incredibly specific and useful later on. They gave me intuition that still helps me today as I'm trying to study C, data structures, and operating systems.\n\nIt’s obviously not a replacement for textbooks, but for me it was a fantastic way to *feel* how computers work at a very low level, and it made the transition to more formal books study way smoother.\n\nCurious if anyone else here has tried it and how far you got — did you stop at logic gates, or did you programmed your CPU?",

But honestly I feel like this is the best time to do it, since everyone else is scared and maybe leaving space for me to get a job later.\n\nRight now I’m in what they call “preparatory years,” which is mostly math and physics for two years (calculus, analysis, linear algebra, thermodynamics, electrostatics, organic chemistry, all that stuff). After that, I’ll choose my major, probably CS unless something changes.\n\nMy plan is to start self-teaching programming and development during these two years so by the time I actually get into CS I’m not a total beginner. I want to become good enough at coding and development by the end of the 5 years to freelance whenever I want and build some kind of financial freedom, so I’m not stuck depending on a job forever.\n\nI know it’s a big goal and I’m starting with zero experience in coding but I’m serious about making it work.\n\nHere’s what I’m worried about:\n\n\\* Is it actually possible to become really good at coding from zero in 5 years? Like good enough to freelance or get decent jobs?\n\n\\* Should I be scared about AI taking all the software jobs?\n\n\\* How safe is CS compared to other majors like mechanical or electrical engineering?\n\n\\* What should I be doing during these two prep years to prepare myself ? Like put yourself in my shoes for a second please.\n\nSorry for the long post but I wanted to say everything that’s on my mind.

No animation besides maybe the player's pawn moving along the way. \nMultiple players of course, and if not a true multiplayer, at least a way to make a program that could have various entries and parameters set by the gamemaster.\n\nI have a tad of experience with Python, and it'd be useful for me to learn more, so that would be my fav medium if possible, along with it allowing me to make it a downloable exe file.\n\n\nAll that being said, what program/language/game engine would you recommend ? \nI looked up a few, and so far the most notable ones seem to be Pygames if I wanna do everything from scratch, or websites like Screentop or Boardgame.\n\n\n\n(Related coding question : how would you implement the different pathways a pawn can take with a given dice number ? My boardgame would have different paths and intersections, and no imposed direction of movement. What logic could I use to make my program give the player the option to say, with a throw of 4, go back and forth to end up on the same tile ?)\n\n\n\nThank you so much in advance for your help, and have a good day !",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So I'm working on an app that essentially allows you to log things you do throughout the day. So if I wake up at 7 AM and do Yoga on September 2, then later I look at the logs for September 2, I will see that I did in fact do Yoga at 7 AM.\n\nI'm really struggling with timezones, mainly because I have it in my head that times should always be stored in UTC, and it's a headache to get working.\n\nThe standard advice is to store it in UTC and then convert to the users timezone when retrieving it, but this doesn't work here since I always want to see the log time relative to the timezone I was in at that time, not the one I'm in now (so if I was in California on September 2 when I did Yoga, then later I look at the log while I'm in New York, I still want to see that I did it at 7 AM, not that I did it 10 AM Eastern.)\n\nSo the solution I came up with is to store started\\_at and ended\\_at in UTC, and also store the timezone offsets for wherever the user was at that time, that way I can always display the correct time for the logs. However, this seems really inefficient from a database indexing perspective. 99% of the log queries on the app are for a specific calendar day according to the users location on that day. Which means looking up logs for a specific day goes from the built in database timestamp magic, to having to query every log in a 3 day range, calculate the times adjusted for the saved timezone offset of that record, and then check if the date matches. \n\nSo I also added a relative\\_start\\_date and relative\\_end\\_date to every log, which always stores whatever calendar date the log was started and finished on according to the user's timezone at that time. This way queries can easily be searched by date.\n\nThe system kind of works, but I keep second guessing if it's really the best way. It feels like a lot of work and a lot of somewhat overlapping fields (started\\_at, ended\\_at, relative\\_start\\_date, relative\\_end\\_date, start\\_time\\_zone\\_offset, end\\_time\\_zone\\_offset) just to keep track of the time. It almost feels like it would be easier to just store the calendar date and then store start\\_time and end\\_time as seconds from midnight (and maybe an optional end\\_calendar\\_date for cases when the log spans two days), but I have it in my head that this is wrong and times should always be in stored in UTC.\n\nWhat do you guys think? How would you store times in this situation? ",

My plan is eventually to learn C well and move to assembly anyway and I'm fully invested in putting the hours in. \n\nMy current plan was to knuckle down get good at DSA and python then move over but there's always the argument of learning top down vs bottom up. \n\nWhat's everyones thoughts? Should I just put the effort in and go straight to the things I find interesting? I'm just scared it's a bit of a waste, I have books for python like Grokking algorithms and data structures. \n\nApreciate your input! ",

I started learning a few languages, but I've always been the type of person who needs to understand why something rather than just how. Thus, I've decided to learn computer science in a real way, which led me to SICP.\n\nLook, I'm not dumb, but damn this book makes me feel like a moron.  I'll be reading and getting it pretty well, and then it throws an exercise at me that makes me question my worth as a human being.\n\nSome of the exercises are fine, and I get it mostly right and understand what's going on with my mistakes, but some just feel way beyond me (it's the Simpson rule exercise that prompted me to write this btw).\n\nI guess I'm just wondering if this is a normal feeling, or do I need a new hobby?  Again, to be fair, I actually feel like I have a pretty decent understanding of what the book is getting at; working through recursions from recursive and iterative frames was really instructive, and seeing the general summation formula was a big eureka moment for me, but good God that exercise brought me right back down to earth.",

        "content": "Hi guys, how do you think about architecting an app when real users are involved and you’re trying to find an effective solution? By effective I mean (ignoring UX for now):\n\n1. Solves the user’s problem in a near-optimal way performance-wise (bottlenecks could be DB queries, language choice, or old code not updated for stricter requirements).\n2. Isn’t overly complex: logic is intuitive, code easy to understand/maintain, minimal moving parts.\n3. Cost/time effective: I almost always underestimate how long production-ready work takes, and the startup urgency makes this stressful.\n\nContext: I’m a junior SWE at a small but successful startup (\\~10k customers, $1M+ revenue), no mentors, CS degree. I’ve shipped revenue-generating software at this company, but it feels sluggish and poorly architected cause simple changes take too long and my users aren't happy. This gets especially tough when there's older code not written by me which looks like it was written just to get things working with no regard for quality.\n\nQuestions I struggle with repeatedly:\n\n1. How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.\n2. How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.\n3. How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.\n4. How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?\n5. Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?\n6. Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?\n\n**I rely on AI** a lot for these questions and I worry I’m making uninformed choices that will become bad habits when I work with better, more experienced engineers. Is there some sort of tutorial / video that goes through this (Couldn't find the resources for this honestly). Or is this trial-and-error method the only way to learn?",

It can be anything from a website or app to a game or even a hardware-based project like a robotic arm.\n\nOriginally, I had a cool idea, but our teacher just dropped a new requirement: the project has to be either educational or environmental. Last year's students made a fitness app or a horror game, so this is a bit of a change.\n\nI'm looking for some fresh and interesting ideas that fit this new theme. I enjoy both programming and hardware. I also have skills in Blender and Unreal Engine, so I can work with 3D graphics and game development.\n\nDo you have any ideas that blend technology with education or the environment? Maybe something that helps people learn to code in a fun way, or a project that monitors and helps reduce a household's energy consumption? Maybe something interactive in 3D? I'm open to all ideas, even if they are outside my comfort zone.",

My main goal is to get comfortable enough to build small projects like a web scraper, expense tracker, or to-do list app without relying too heavily on AI.\n\nI’ve done few courses here and there but I end up just getting demotivated and decided to start building \n\nI understand the basics variable, loops etc (done them many times through different free courses lol)\n\nSo far, I’ve managed to build a simple weather app (fetches data when I enter a city) and a file organizer. The problem is that if I had to rebuild them from scratch without AI help, I’m not confident I could do it.\n\nWhat’s the best way to approach learning so that I can really understand Python and reduce my dependence on AI? Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?\n\n\nUltimately, I want to understand enough Python to use tools like Codex effectively, though I might take things further if I end up really enjoying it.\n\nThanks!\n",

But I've been very interested in the idea of making an animation program (Adobe Animate, Toon Boom Harmony, etc) but I have no idea how the logic of saving data to frames and then showing/hiding that data would work. Everytime I try to search anything about it I only get searches on how to play animations in java, which I don't think would apply for what I'm trying to do? (I'm unsure.) I'm not looking for a ginormous step by step guide or anything, just a general push in the direction of how a coder would think about doing something like that. The only way I can think to do it in my head involves quite literally an infinite number of if statements/switch statements, which I feel that can't be right. See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.\n\nThis is an example of how I'm thinking of this in my head (This isn't a specific coding language, I'm nore trying to get across the concept of what I'm doing)\n\n\\---\n\nIf current\\_frame == 1: \n\nerase previous drawing on screen \n\nshow drawing\\_1 on screen\n\nif current\\_frame ==2: \n\nerase previous drawing on screen \n\nshow drawing\\_2 on screen\n\n\\---\n\netc etc it goes infinitely, these could also be switch statements, but I'm not sure how that makes it any better.\n\nI'm aware of the existence of dictionaries/mapping/lookup tables/whatever their called you know what I'm trying to talk about, but those have a finite amount of entries in them (as far as I'm aware?) the amount of frames the user decides to make is literally infinite.\n\nThis may be a silly question, I'm not very familiar with coding visuals yet, so maybe this is obvious to soneone who is familiar with coding visuals. Thanks even if this is stupid!!",

Right now I have more of an uninformed ideological view on this as in 'LLMs and their crawlers/scrapers bad'.\n\nI do see the merit in search engines and their crawlers though and since AI bots - even if they are overhyped and burning the earth - might have some merit to them, would it even make sense to block them?\n\n## Second question\n\nI've written a webserver to host my personal website. Hosting and setup was smooth, it's just a go web-app behind caddy as my reverse proxy. I currently don't have any means of bot protection though.\n\nMy current preferred solution would be to use cloudflare but I'm not sure if that is more complex than a diy solution.

I do have a degree but in a completely unrelated field. This all sounds too good to be true, but I’m getting some mixed info online with people saying it depends on the bootcamp, others saying they did get a job right away, and many who never claim to have gone to a bootcamp to begin with saying it’s not worth it. So this question is specifically for people who have gone through a bootcamp with QuickStart, is it worth it? Did you get a job soon after? And if you don’t mind answering, what was your starting salary?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "It has been a career bucket list item to work at a startup that is just getting off the ground.  I joined as a staff engineer on a central platform team with one other engineer.  Eventually the team grew to 4 engineers.  As startups tend to do the financials struggled and the team was let go.  However with everything I learned I could confidently speak about almost all parts of platform engineering with hands-on confidence I did 1 interview which resulted in 1 offer.  [Note: It was a company I had previously worked for and knew lots of people.  This isn't a brag about getting a job in a struggling market so this context is important.]  Here is some of my experiences.\n\nWorking at large companies things tend to be somewhat figured out.  A typical question I would get when interviewing new engineers for roles on the team was about what the most difficult part of the job is.  My honest answer was always there was me and another engineer.  If we didn't know the answer that means you have to figure it out because no one else at the company knows.  These are some of the parts of the job I always knew about but lacked working hands-on:\n\n\n**DNS** - At every company I worked for DNS was managed by another team, typically SREs.  I knew about various record types and all that and I knew how to dig a DNS record but here we had to setup the R53 ourselves, purchase the domains ourselves, setup the subdomains ourselves and setup all the record ourselves.  We had to figure out how to manage this in a sustainable way so DNS isn't spread across a bunch of AWS accounts and do that in a secure fashion.\n\n\n**CICD** - Of course every engineer oftentimes interfaces with CICD.  My experience was typically extending some scripts someone else wrote to do most of the hard stuff.  The cluster was owned and operated by someone else.  But we had to figure out what CICD to use, how to integrate it into our pipelines, how to build our services, how to house containers, how to deploy the services.  There was no service builder helper to extend it had to start from scratch.\n\n\n**App Startup** - The companies I worked for already had app startup figured out.  There was some framework you'd implement which would give you logging, metrics and some form of observability for free out of the box.  But we had to figure out how to get these apps running and build out this framework ourselves.  This even included selecting which language to use for our platform, how to structure the project and coding standards.\n\n\n**Infrastructure** - Every place loves to interview you on scalability but I've personally always found it somewhat abstracted away from me as the developer.  My job was to crunch the code to make my container and it was someone else's job to scale it up or at least provide a convenient way to do so - usually some core tech team.  At the very least usually stuff before it hits your code is owned and operated by someone else.  Now again we leveraged AWS so lots of it is batteries included.  The API Gateways scale, if we're using serverless it scales, if we're using a managed database it scales.  But not everything was managed.  So we typically had to write out the entire infrastructure diagrams ourselves and find scale points.  This allowed me to walk into system design interviews not just spewing out memorization about various scaling techniques I actually had to live and breathe it for a long time.  Questions about trade offs and decisions were now extremely easy to talk about because these were things I actually had to solve personally.\n\n\n**IAC** - I lacked a lot of Terraform know-how going into the job.  So even simple questions which I now know as Terraform 101 such as \"How do I save this state file from my ephemeral CICD node?\" were complete unknowns.  We had to figure out basically everything Terraform from scratch.  Companies I've worked for in the past usually didn't expose Terraform to me directly.  They were hybrid bare metal and public cloud options.  So we had some form of IAC but it was always proprietary to the company, usually owned and managed by someone else and typically pared down.  So this gave me direct exposure to how to describe my infrastructure as code including things like I said about how to save state files, how to tag my resources, how to manage int/dev/stage/prod environments and all of that.  My previous experience was just writing some YAML and it was someone else's job to interpret all of that.\n\n\n**Observability** - Like I said previously usually this is something included in the app framework of the company.  But this gave me experience setting up Grafana (our tool of choice), pumping or replicating logs to it, setting up collectors for metrics, setting up alerting and all the dashboarding.  The alerting and dashboarding I'm sure most people have had experience with but usually for logging and metrics I'd just have to inject something into my application and it \"just worked\" without having to think about it too terribly much.\n\n\nThis is a long winded post and not a question at all but more a bit of advice.  If you are given the opportunity to work at a very early stage start up I highly recommend it.  My end result was the same as most early start ups - I got let go.  However I feel it made me a much more employable engineer that now can talk about times I actually built a lot of components that go into a backend platform.  I don't need to talk about these things in the abstract, which of course is still important to understand, but I can speak to them in the concrete now.  It was a fantastic growing and learning experience for me, personally.",

The whole process felt like the company had unreasonable expectations, no respect for work-life balance, and zero transparency about pay.\n\nTLDR: Startup wanted a founding engineer to work 72 hours a week, refused to talk pay until pressed, then reluctantly said 150k to 220k.\n\nAre companies in this market seriously expecting crazy hours while refusing to talk pay until the very end?",

        "content": "The way I learnt to code was kind of backwards. I started off on forums like MPGH, first learning how to use a debugger, then learning x86 asm, and then C. For most of my coding \"life\", I just wrote everything in asm, and then later on C but still mostly asm because I found everything else kind of confusing. I got pretty good at breaking DRM for older software, (2000-2010ish),\n\nThis kind of setup me up well for university, because all of the \"low-level\", algorithmic, concurrency stuff was pretty breezy. Honestly, I struggled heaps with web dev, anything with GUIs, and anything that wasn't C/C++. All of my C++ assignments were basically just written in plain C were I could.\n\nNow I am out of uni, trying to apply for jobs, and work on skills in my own time, and I've realized I am absolutely horrific at writing actual software.\n\nI struggle to use git lol\n\nCI/CD, unit testing etc. is confusing\n\nI struggle with database stuff\n\nI struggle with writing OOP in a not-shit way. It's confusing. Roll your own \"OOP\" in C is less confusing because... it's roll your own.\n\nGet fucking confused by any API documentation that isn't Win32 or POSIX/unix shit\n\nAll of the projects I try write in anything but C/asm are fuckin terrible. The codes usually a mess and poorly planned, and it can take me significantly longer to code something in Java than C, just due to the sheer bloat I unintentionally introduce. There's all the cool \"high level\" tools/concepts you have, but I don't understand when or how to implement them appropriately. Like oh cool ill split my shit into classes, now some shit doesn't work because my other class needs to access an interface I can't expose, and now my whole design is fucked, and I just spend ages reworking the design aspects. Whereas with C, I am generally pretty aware of best practices,, as I used to spend so much time trying to break stuff, and work backwards from there, as well reading heaps of source code for old cool shit, as well as broken old cool shit.\n\nIt's so much easier working with OS APIs, particularly with ASM. All the args can just be thought of as their size, and not type, and it is very easy to step through asm you write with a debugger, and follow the logic along as you go.\n\nNone of the projects I do really seem to have much relation to the roles that are available to me. I've made my own little VMs in asm, my own raw implementations of networking stuff, purposefully weirdly designed software that can only be run by having another exe patch everything in real time(obfuscation is fun).\n\nNone of these things are \"software\" though. They're just implementations of an idea/concept, are not really made for real-world use, and nor do they demonstrate real-world software development ability (the actual feedback I have had while interviewing).\n\nTo be fair, I really had no idea about what actual software dev was about prior to starting my degree, and now I sort of feel like I don't particularly have the aptitude for the field. The thing I noticed when studying is the things I struggled with was entirely inverse from my peers.\n\nAny insights or advice is much appreciated.",

        "content": "I joined my big tech company about 4 months ago. Prior to this, I was at a very chill company making lower than the average swe in my city but also had quite a bit of free time. I would always work on side projects and was always down to jump on random startup ideas with good friends where I would only handle the tech stuff. I never really did this stuff to make money (of course I always hoped that it would pay off each time) but simply for the love of the game. I genuinely think me building all these websites in the past taught me a lot and turned me into a really good engineer. Now, I'm in your typical big tech company making 250k.\n\nThe other day, a friend reached out with an idea for a tool. The idea makes sense to me and doesn't sound too difficult to build. He also has a pipeline to market it and already some validation so I would only have to handle the tech stuff so I immediately told him I'm down.\n\nHowever thinking about it after, I'm wondering if it's the smartest thing to do. I like to think that I'm good at what I do so even at work I only work 8h and it's not too bad but now that I'm making plenty of money, I'm not sure if I want to spend time and effort on trying to build random things.\n\nDo you guys think it's worth it? On one hand, there's still a chance it can end up succeeding and I also continue to learn more things but on the other hand, should I continue to spend my time and effort on these side projects rather than pour it all into my job?\n\nAdvice is appreciated!",

        "content": "Hey all, \n\nI've been grinding through tech interviews and I've noticed some stark cultural differences. Disclaimer: this isn't about bias—it's just my personal observations and what I've heard from others in the industry. \n\nNot saying one way is better or worse, but it's definitely shaped how I prep.\n\nFrom my experience, interviewers who grew up in the US (or 'completely Westernized') tend to keep things chill and conversational. They'll ask about your background, chat about past projects, and throw in questions that simulate problem-solving discussions. Often helpful with hints if you get stuck, and the vibe/culture fit is crucial. \n\nOn the flip side, I've had a few of interviews with folks from Asian cultural backgrounds and man, they crank up the difficulty. Expect hard LeetCode problems right out the gate like a hard dynamic programming question never seen, minimal hints, and a more \"pass/fail\" mentality—either your code runs perfectly (or memorizing the perfect answers), or it's game over. \n\nI think it stems from the insane competition back home; I've heard stories where job postings in China get thousands of applicants in an hour, so they filter ruthlessly. That mindset carries over here, e.g.treating work like a promotion game rather than delivering value.\n\nBasically two styles: \"textbooker\"  who want puzzle masters, vs. \"collaborative\" who prioritize discussion and personality.\n\nAnd don't get me started on communication styles. Overall, it's made me adapt either memorizing hard LeetCode for certain rounds but appreciate the more human approach from others. \n\nAnyone else notice this trend? How do you handle it?",

I actually worked those jobs, unlike many in this field who say that line. I wasn't even close to as stressed as I am in this field. I would probably still work them if they paid the bills, but they don't.

Interviews have rarely anything to do with what you do on the job. Thanks to all the endless technology programmers have to make up every year, good luck keeping up with everything. Also, look forward to 3-5 rounds of BS each time. Good luck finding the time to do this if you have a job you hate. I guess good luck if you run out of days to use for interviews.

When I met with my manager last month, he didn't have any concerns with my performance so far, but I imagine that that wouldn't mean much.

Good benefits, stability, blah blah blah. Cheap city. Probably on track for a 10-20% promo in 6-18 months. I'm bored but comfortable. My rate of learning is pretty low and one of my biggest fears is stagnation. I'm the expert which is scary considering I'm not long out of  an M.S, I don't have anyone to learn from.\n\nI'm looking at a 30% raise in base pay to join a startup, plus options to purchase 0.2% equity with 4 year vest. Current valuation is 60M after series A with 5M ARR and less than 20 employees. The downsides obviously include instability and the risk the equity is worth toilet paper. Unique to this role includes high amounts of travel. It's also riding the AI bubble so if that pops it would impact this company's perceived value and ability to get customers.\n\nI might work like hell, get laid off in 6 months, have a resume that looks like shit? Or maybe the company will blow up and ill pick up a nest egg? I had one role for 16 months, and my current one would be 15 months, so I'm really worried about my resume optics if I take this job and they go under or I learn that I absolutely hate it.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "TLDR: Getting labeled as problematic when trying to help my team not destroy customer trust due to poor engineering practices, how to turn the tide so management will listen?\n\nFrustrated with my team and going to get fired if I keep alienating myself by trying to do the right thing. Background: Only self-taught dev on my team, low/mid level, remote, love my company and very loyal for them taking a chance on me when I was an intern. Over the past year management changes have destroyed my team’s effectiveness.\n\nQA: Obvious bugs are getting pushed daily, we lack testing, and there’s no chain of approval. People just click approve button after skimming the code. We have juniors approving and pushing each other’s code with no oversight. Sometimes the code doesn’t even work, or it doesn’t do what they think it’s doing due to inexperience in the codebase. I feel obligated to point out bugs etc when I see them, but I hate having to be the bad guy on a daily basis. Seniors don’t seem to care even when I bring it up to them.\n\nPlanning: Designers make tickets for feature work and throw them in “to-do”. Tickets are done out of order, so code written today will need to be rewritten next week when the other ticket is done. I feel obligated to try and point out that doing X before Y will mean we need to redo X, but they don’t see this as wasting time, they see me as blocking progress or Idk what I’m talking about because “it always works out anyway” (I always end up handling the duplicated work). Sometimes tickets literally cannot be done without core functionality from other tickets, so juniors will just do a crazy workaround or make the feature do something completely broken instead. We waste weeks arguing before management will finally let me fix things, then they complain I’m always prolonging simple tickets.\n\nArchitecture: There’s no technical design process at all. Management says they trust engineers to make those decisions on the fly, including juniors. The designers sometimes make a figma reference sheet that doesn’t even let you do the requested features, and juniors will code half of it before realizing they’re blocked then we go back to the drawing board, instead of listening to me pointing out “hey, this doesn’t look like it’s going to do what it seems like you’re asking for” during sprint planning. They claim I’m worrying too much about edge cases.\n\nFor example, a junior will pick up a ticket that should involve creating a system to support doing X task securely, using backend transactions etc. Instead of having a proper design doc to follow, they ad-lib it together using flaky frontend logic because they don’t know any better. They’ll have the frontend spoofing admin api calls to make those transactions work, creating a system that now requires the api to accept admin calls from non-admin JWT tokens. This means my next ticket has to follow their unsafe patterns, so I’m stuck refactoring their feature to something safe before I can even start my tickets. Me pointing this out as a problem leads to me getting labeled as nit-picky, too opinionated, and “thinking my way is the only way”.\n\nI’ve been trying to affect change, but it’s above my pay grade and thus rejected because I have no authority whatsoever. Management pushes back publicly against my concerns, and when I’m proven right and end up fixing things, it’s generally in private so the general sentiment for me is low. I’m also advocating for better practices for technical planning, design, QA, etc but it’s led to me getting alienated from the rest of the team who thinks we’re doing just fine. Any conversation I start now leads to arguments because I immediately get mischaracterized as causing problems when I open my mouth. I’ll raise a concern, and the response is usually to the effect of “no it’s not” or “prove it”… so I will screenshare in the codebase why something is an issue, then get told “stop being too technical”. Basically they don’t trust me when I tell them something is problematic, and then still don’t understand when I show the code causing the issue. It’s a no-win situation.\n\n\n1:1 with the tech lead who said basically “we don’t need to worry about good principles because we can rewrite the whole app in a month if we really had to, just chill out and stop worrying, the company isn’t really affected.” I disagree wholeheartedly, I think our performance has the ability to kill the company by destroying our customer’s trust from the sheer amount of bugs and misrepresented data in the product.",

It was previously understood that you really don't need a Master's for an entry level role in CS, but getting one could mean a nice increase in pay compared to those with just a Bachelors. But now I am seeing more people applying for entry-level positions with a Master's. \n\nI believe we are reaching a point where having a Master's is the bare minimum for post-grad job hunting. What do you guys think? I haven't heard much back besides a couple of OAs since graduating with my Bachelors in CS earlier this year in May, and I think this silent shift might have to do something about it. Not saying it isn't possible to get an entry-level role with only a Bachelor's, but from a company point of view, are you going to hire someone with a Bachelor's over a Master's?\n\n  \nLove to know your guy's opinions on this, not a topic I see discussed a lot.",

My dad died almost exactly one year ago, the same week my live-in partner admitted to being unfaithful and left me. I am getting help but dealt with severe depression before this, and all this launched me into a new stratosphere of grief. This got even worse when we found out my mom’s cancer spread again last month. I’ve barely been able to feed myself, bathe, or do the bare minimum at my current job.\n\nI’m a data engineer and I am currently employed at an ok company doing consulting. It’s not perfect, upper management is abusive with our time and there is client drama. I have no intention of staying long term but I’ve been there over a year and it’s remote so I can visit my mom. \n\nA few months back when things were ok with my mom, I applied for a job at databricks for a solution architect and unexpectedly got an interview several months later. It’s also remote and I’ve been there over a year so I qualify for FMLA.\n\nI am unhappy at my current job and this pays more so I wanted to give it a shot. Passed the first round just fine, but then I got the assessment. It’s all pyspark filesystem questions and I have zero idea how to solve them. I’m very good at SQL, Python, and C# but my brain is completely and utterly stumped. I cannot perform under pressure and I hate myself for it. I feel so angry that I’ve squandered this opportunity.\n\nI had a panic attack just looking at the assessment. I feel like a complete failure. I got so lucky and actually got an interview at databricks, and I completely screwed it up. I just closed the assessment and cried. I feel so alone, I miss my dad and my ex, I’m afraid my mom will die any day now. I wish I was strong enough to see this through. But I’m not. \n\nI’m afraid that even if I try my best or fake it till I make it, I’ll end up in a situation where I’ll get fired or they’ll find out I’m not qualified. Since all this happened, I feel like I dropped 50 IQ points. My mind is so focused on grief that I can’t code like I used to. I used to be smarter, years ago I could have done this, but I just can’t.\n\nI don’t know what to say or do and how to follow up with the recruiter. I don’t even want to try to take the assessment because I’m so overwhelmed, I’m behind at my current job and don’t have the time or energy for the interview process, but I also feel stuck and sad at my current job, at least I’m comfortable though.\n\nI guess I’m just looking for sympathy and support, and maybe some advice as to what I should say to the recruiter. How can I withdrawal in a way that could potentially leave the door open for future opportunities?",

I've been employed with this company for about 4 years due to a university partnership (part time), and I was promoted to Senior after only a year of full time employment, about 6 months ago.\n\nI work in the revenue department, and I am the technical lead over an application that brings in double-digit-billions of $ per year. \n\nI am looking to apply to other companies for a salary increase, as right now i'm barely into the 6 figure range as a senior, though I do live in a MCOL area so its not the worst pay in the world. But definitely don't want to be stuck making this for the rest of my career, and also not a big fan of this part of the country. \n\nThis leads me to my issue though -- should I apply to senior positions or normal SWE positions? Also, should I lie on my resumé to downplay the application I lead? It looks unbelievable that I list a $XY Billion application on my resumé as only 2 years post-grad. \n\nI am just not really sure how to proceed with applications, so looking to get any and all advice. Thanks!!",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm posting for a friend since they don't have enough karma to post here:\n\nI graduated in recent years and secured a software engineer job a couple months after graduation doing standard dev work in the traditional way (no AI). Unfortunately, I was laid off about a year later.\n\nI've since landed a new role, the title is Software Engineer, but it is very AI centric, and any dev work is heavily done using AI tools where software engineers more or less prompt and review the generated code. Writing actual code is minimal, just small tweaks to results. The brainwork is mostly being offloaded to AI, we're instructed to write agents to attempt to automate almost anything and everything.\n\nI’m concerned about not being able to grow my dev skills. I genuinely miss writing and reading code and delving into codebases to solve problems. I miss debugging/troubleshooting, and learning intricacies, nuances, and quirks of the language and technologies that I am working with.\n\nIn the off chance that these AI tools for dev work end up being scrapped several years down the line, I’m concerned that my skills will not have grown here. I’ve already heard first hand stories of experienced devs using these kinds of tools feeling as if their skills are dulling.\n\nStill being very early in my career, I’m wondering if I should stay in my current role (because this may be the future), or if I should try to find a job with a company that still does traditional software engineering with complemental AI use (e.g. Copilot in VS) to help me hone my raw SDE skills.\n\nI personally feel that these AI tools are best used by experienced engineers who have learned over time what to ask for, what looks good etc. I feel as though it is probably easier for an experienced dev to learn and make use of AI tools/coding assistants than someone who’s inexperienced and won't know enough to even know what to look for.\n\nSo regardless of where things are headed, I think that real life hands-on coding experience is going to be king, but this is just one opinion. I'd like to hear some different points of view so I can make an informed choice.\n\nAre there any arguments for me staying in an AI centric role (which may be the future)? Or should I try and move back to a traditional dev role (which may serve me best regardless)?\n\n",

I’d say I’m mid-level, maybe senior depending on the team. The thing is, I feel a bit stuck in my career. Moving toward a team lead role in .NET seems to require switching jobs, grinding harder technically, and pushing myself in ways I can’t really do right now for personal reasons.\nA friend suggested I look into Dynamics 365. His reasoning was that it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communication — which are actually strengths of mine. Plus, having a solid dev background might give me an edge compared to people who started directly in Dynamics.\nI did a bit of research and it seems like the Dynamics market is growing and there’s a clearer career path (especially with certifications). I get that certs alone aren’t enough without real experience, but at least the path feels more structured than in my current track. I’ve also heard people say Dynamics can be “boring” or “not real programming,” but honestly, I’m fine with that — stability and problem-solving are more important to me now.\nFor context, I’m currently in a financially good job, so I’m not desperate to switch. But I don’t want to stay stagnant either.\nSo my questions are:\n• Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?\n• What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?\n• Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?\nWould love to hear from people who are already in the field or made a similar switch.",

For now it feels like a dream of course, but maybe in 10 years I'll be there, and it would be awesome. The thing is that I'm fascinated by AI and truly believe that this is the future. Probably it's a controversial topic, but I really believe that AIs will change the world as the Internet did 35~ years ago, and I'd like to be one of those who'll build this world one way or another.\n\nAnyway, the question is, what skills should I develop now to start my career in AI/ML? I have a quite decent (at least in my country it's considered decent, but not some really high level) IT background with several years of system administration and a software engineer college degree (technically I can code, but my job has never required something more serious than Python/Bash QoL scripts, so my coding skills are probably somewhere around junior), but for some reason I feel like except the general basics it does not apply to LLMs/AI. I mean... theoretically I could get a job where I'd have to develop a mobile/desktop app that is built around AI or something like that, but it's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for something that is directly related to AIs, even if it's just a prompt engineering role. ",

        "author": "Mislavoo7",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**TL;DR:** I’ve worked \\~9 years in the same IT company (mostly backend, some frontend + DevOps). My salary is low (\\~2/3 of country average). I built two showcase apps (Rails backend + React Native frontend) to better understand my market value. Looking for feedback on my execution, portfolio strength, what to improve, and whether I should present myself as junior/mid/senior. Also wondering if \\~$20/h freelance (20h/week) is realistic.\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI've been working in an IT company for about 9 years, always in the same company. My work is mostly backend, but sometimes I do a bit of frontend and DevOps as well. The issue is that my current salary is quite low, about 2/3 of the average salary in my country. The company also has some financial problems, but on the bright side, I get a lot of freedom and flexibility. Before I risk switching jobs or trying to build a second income stream, I want to better understand my real market value.\n\nThe challenge for me is that my company relies heavily on internal processes, workflows, and custom setups, so it’s hard to compare my experience with \"standard\" projects. That’s why I decided to build my own apps as a showcase of what I can actually do.\n\n# What I built\n\nI made two projects:\n\n* A Ruby on Rails app with a CMS, user dashboard, public-facing part, and an API.\n* A React Native (Expo) app that consumes the RoR API.\n\n# The idea\n\nUsers can sign up or log in via either the web app or the mobile app. Once logged in, they can add products (with price and brand) and save them into lists. Each list has fields such as date, shop name, and value. Users can edit and delete both lists and products.\n\nI intentionally kept the functionality simple so people can test it without friction. My goal wasn't to build a \"real\" product, but to create a minimal app that demonstrates everyday developer practices.\n\n# What I worked with\n\n**Ruby on Rails** (API + web app + CMS + user dashboard), using Devise for authentication.\n\n* Two Devise models: Admins (login to CMS, only created by other admins) and Users (sign in to the dashboard to manage lists).\n* No email confirmation because I didn't want to set up MailGun/SendGrid, but I understand the process (domains, spam issues, etc.).\n* I use Tailwind CSS for frontend styling in my RoR app.\n* Stimulus JS for interactivity (sorting, filtering, etc.).\n\n**Mobile: React Native (Expo).**\n\nUsers can add products without signing in, but creating a lists requires a login.\n\n* Authentication: the mobile app sends email/password to the Rails API, which returns a JWT token. The token unlocks all features (list + product management, user settings).\n* Settings include: language (HR/EN/DE), currency (€/$), theme (light/dark).\n* Legal pages are public and available in all three languages without changing settings.\n\n**DevOps**\n\nI Deployed the RoR app on a Hetzner server and installed Ubuntu 24, Nginx, Puma, cloned the RoR repo, precompiled assets, configured secrets, etc.\n\n**Content**\n\nI wrote demo texts in three languages I'm familiar with: Croatian, German, and English.\n\n# Code & live apps\n\nGitHub repo for Rails app: [Sparenzi Web](https://sparenzi.eu/) and [Repo](https://github.com/Mislavoo7/sparenziweb/tree/master)\n\n(There are few commits because I developed in a private GitLab repo and only published the final version here)\n\nGitHub repo for React Native app: [Sparenzi](https://github.com/Mislavoo7/sparenzi)\n\n# What I'd love to know\n\n* How would you rate my project execution? (both technically and as a portfolio piece)\n* What should I improve before showing this to recruiters / potential employers?\n* Based on what I’ve shown here, should I present myself as junior, mid, or senior developer?\n* I’m considering taking on freelance jobs in the \\~$20/h range (about 20h/week alongside my current job). Is this realistic, or should I ask for more/less per hour and more/less hours per week?\n\nAny honest feedback is super welcome — I’m trying to figure out my real position on the market so I can plan my next steps.\n\nThanks!",

I have some textbooks in mind to buy. Are they any good? Are there any other online/physical sources you recommend? Do you just do neetcode/leetcode? Would really like to hear some advice on how to stay knowledgeable and prepare for interviews. Thanks :)\n\n* System Design Interview – An insider's guide by Alex Xu\n* Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview: Pass Tough Coding Interviews, Get Noticed, and Negotiate Successfully (Cracking the Interview & Career) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell\n* A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills by Jay Wengrow\n* Grokking Algorithms, Second Edition by Aditya Y Bhargava",
