The assignment itself was pretty straightforward an ETL job. I do not have previous experience working as a data engineer.\n\nI built out some basic tests in Python using pytest. I set up fixtures to mock the boto3 S3 client, wrote a few unit tests to verify that my transformation logic produced the expected results, and checked that my code called the right S3 methods with the right parameters. \n\nThe interviewer were showering me with praise for the tests I have written. They kept saying, we do not see candidate writing tests. They keep pointing out how good I was just because of these tests.\n\nBut here’s the thing: my tests were super simple.  I didn’t write any integration tests against Glue or do any end-to-end pipeline validation. I just mocked the S3 client and verified my Python code did what it was supposed to do. \n\nI come from a background in software engineering, so i have a habit of writing extensive test suites. \n\nLooks like just because of the tests, I might have a higher probability of getting this role.\n\nHow rigorously do we test in data engineering?",

        "author": "ssinchenko",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I often hear the question of why Apache Spark is considered \"slow.\" Some attribute it to \"Java being slow,\" while others point to Spark’s supposedly outdated design. I disagree with both claims. I don’t think Spark is poorly designed, nor do I believe that using JVM languages is the root cause. In fact, I wouldn’t even say that Spark is truly slow.\n\nBecause this question comes up so frequently, I wanted to explore the answer for myself first. In short, Spark is a unified engine, not just as a marketing term, but in practice. Its execution model is hybrid, combining both code generation and vectorization, with a fallback to iterative row processing in the Volcano style. On one hand, this enables Spark to handle streaming, semi-structured data, and well-structured tabular data, making it a truly unified engine. On the other hand, the No Free Lunch Theorem applies: you can't excel at everything. As a result, open-source Vanilla Spark will almost always be slower on DWH-like OLAP queries compared to specialized solutions like Snowflake or Trino, which rely on a purely vectorized execution model.\n\nThis blog post is a compilation of my own Logseq notes from investigating the topic, reading scientific papers on the pros and cons of different execution models, diving into Spark's source code, and mapping all of this to Lakehouse workloads.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not affiliated with Databricks or its competitors in any way, but I use Spark in my daily work and maintain several OSS projects like GraphFrames and GraphAr that rely on Apache Spark. In my blog post, I have aimed to remain as neutral as possible.\n\nI’d be happy to hear any feedback on my post, and I hope you find it interesting to read!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "\"Start right. Shift left.\"\n\nIs that just another marketing gimmick in data engineering?\n\nHere is my opinion after thinking about it for the last couple of weeks.\n\nI bet every data engineer who's ever been exposed to data quality has heard at least one of these two terms.\n\nThe first time I heard “shift left” and “shift right,” it felt like an empty concept.\n\nOf course, I come from AI/ML, where pretty much everything is a marketing gimmick until proven otherwise. 😂\n\nAnd “start right, shift left” can really feel like nonsense. Especially when it's said without a practical explanation, a set of tools to do it, or even a reason why it makes sense.\n\n  \nNow that I need to get better at data engineering, I’ve been thinking about this a lot. So...\n\n**Here is what I've come to understand about \"start right\" and \"shift left\".** (please correct if wrong).\n\n  \n**Start right**\n\nStart right is about detection. It means spotting your first data quality issues at the far right end of your data pipeline. Usually called downstream.\n\nBut not with traditional data quality tests. The idea is to do it in a scalable way. Something you can quickly set up across hundreds or thousands of tables and get results fast.\n\nBecause nobody wants to set up manual checks for every single table.\n\nIn practice, starting right means using data observability tools that rely on algorithms to pick up anomalies in your data quality metrics. It's about finding the unknowns.\n\nOnce that’s done, it’s way easier to prioritize which tables need a manual check. That’s where “shift left” comes in.\n\n  \n**Shift left**\n\nShift left is about prevention. It's about stopping the issues you found earlier from happening again.\n\nYou do that by moving to the left side of the pipeline (upstream) and setting up manual checks and data contracts.\n\nThis is where engineers and business folks agree on what the data should always look like. What values are valid? What data types should we support? What filters should be in place?\n\n  \n\\---\n\nBy starting right and shifting left, we take a realistic and practical approach to data quality. Sure, you can add some basic checks early on. But no matter what, there will always be things we miss, issues that only show up downstream.\n\nThankfully, ML isn’t just a gimmick. It can really help us notice what’s broken.",

        "author": "dsiegs1",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering.\n\nSo about 2 months ago when DuckDB announced their instant SQL feature. It looked super slick, and I immediately thought there's no reason on earth to use this with snowflake because of egress (and abunch of other reasons) but it's cool.\n\nSo I decided to build it anyways: Introducing Snowducks\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s50m6as7ge8f1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd6492295dae218aa8ff2d27b517f2992c389903\n\nAlso - if my goal was to just use instant SQL - it would've been much more simple. But I wanted to use Ducklake. For Reasons. What I built was a caching mechanism using the ADBC driver which checks the query hash to see if the data is local (and fresh), if so return it. If not pull fresh from Snowflake, with automatic limit of records so you're not blowing up your local machine. It then can be used in conjunction with the instant SQL features.\n\nI started with Python because I didn't do any research, and of course my dumb ass then had to rebuild it in C++ because DuckDB extensions are more complicated to use than a UDF (but hey at least I have a separate cli that does this now right???). Learned a lot about ADBC drivers, DuckDB extensions, and why you should probably read documentation first before just going off and building something.\n\nAnyways, I'll be the first to admit I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I also don't even know if I plan to do more....or if it works on anyone else's machine besides mine, but it works on mine and that's cool.\n\nAnyways feel free to check it out - [Github](https://github.com/danjsiegel/snowducks)",

        "content": "I know \"modern data stack\" is basically a cargo cult at this point, and focusing on tooling first over problem-solving is a trap many of us fall into.\n\nBut still, I think it's incredible how difficult simply getting a client to even consider the self-hosted or open-source version of a thing (e.g. Dagster over ADF, dbt over...bespoke SQL scripts and Databricks notebooks) still is in 2025.\n\nSeems like if a client doesn't immediately recognize a product as having backing and support from a major vendor (Qlik, Microsoft, etc), the idea of using it in our stack is immediately shot down with questions like \"why should we use unproven, unsupported technology?\" and \"Who's going to maintain this after you're gone?\" Which are fair questions, but often I find picking the tools that feel easy and obvious at first end up creating a ton of tech debt in the long run due to their inflexibility. The whole platform becomes this brittle, fragile mess, and the whole thing ends up getting rebuilt.\n\nSynapse is a great example of this - I've worked with several clients in a row who built some crappy Rube Goldberg machine using Synapse pipelines and notebooks 4 years ago and now want to switch to Databricks because they spend 3-5x what they should and the whole thing just fell flat on its face with zero internal adoption. Traceability and logging were nonexistent. Finding the actual source for a \"gold\" report table was damn near impossible.\n\nI got a client to adopt dbt years ago for their Databricks lakehouse, but it was like pulling teeth - I had to set up a bunch of demos, slide decks, and a POC to prove that it actually worked. In the end, they were super happy with it and wondered why they didn't start using it sooner. I had other suggestions for things we could swap out to make our lives easier, but it went nowhere because, again, they don't understand the modern DE landscape or what's even possible. There's a lack of trust and familiarity.\n\nIf you work in the industry, how the hell do you convince your boss's boss to let you use actual modern tooling? How do you avoid the trap of \"well, we're a Microsoft shop, so we only use Azure-native services\"?",

My coworkers that are 1.5-1.8x my age are able to recall things that I come to them for help months ago where I can't even remember the context. I haven't been enjoying the late nights fixing pipelines and thinking about work on my vacations and time off. I'd like to switch to something else but the pay has been too good it's hard to break free of the golden handcuffs.\n\n/rant\n\nI guess I'm looking for advice on how to move forward and seeing what someone that used to be in a similar position as me has done.",

I understand the math behind ML but when it comes to actually applying ML solutions for business tasks, I don't think I am that good at this.\n\nI have also been more successful on my job search circuit with data engineer roles than ML roles.

Know SQL, Python, Metabase (BI Tool).\n\nThe company I work for hires a third-party software company that has built and maintains custom apps and software for us including POS (point-of-sale) and Inventory Management software. Additionally, they built us a customer facing mobile application (we're a restaurant group).\n\nThey (the  software company) uses a Mysql version 5.7 database which I understand reached end of life in 2023. This has caused some annoyances like not being able to use dbt or upgrade past version 0.47.9 of Metabase. Recently, I asked them if we can/should upgrade to Mysql 8 at some point and if there is anything we should worry about since version 5.7 reached end of life (like security, tech debt, etc.).\n\nTheir response was \"It (5.7) is still widely used today and we don't need to worry about any vulnerabilities, we'll look into upgrading though\". Then after they \"looked into it\" they said it is best for us to stick with 5.7 for \"stability\". \n\nI am not a data or software engineer, but it SEEMS like what they really mean is \"It would be a lot of work for us to migrate everything over to version 8 and we don't want to deal with that\". I'm not saying it wouldn't be a lot of work, but my feeling is that using 5.7 is not as common as they try to make it out to be and they just don't want to deal with the upgrade and all that it entails.\n\nI'll say again, I know migrating over to 8 would likely take days/weeks/months(?) and is not just a \"click here to migrate and...done!\" kind of thing. The benefits may seem small - me being able to use things like ctes, window functions, the latest version of Metabase (which has some feature that would really benefit us) - but would nonetheless be a great improvement. \n\n  \n1) Is mysql 5.7 still that commonly used?\n\n2) Would most company's have already upgraded?\n\n3) Besides being an inconvenience, are there actual security issues to worry about if we don't upgrade?",

        "content": "We have a very large Tabular cube. When we try to process all tables at once (full process), it runs out of memory and fails. But processing each table one by one manually works fine.\n\nTo automate it, I tried using SSIS in Visual Studio. There's a setting in the *Analysis Services Processing Task* to use separate transactions, but the setting won’t save — every time I reopen the task, it resets. So I’m not sure if it’s being applied at all. Possibly a bug?\n\nAs a workaround, I thought of scripting each table process using XMLA and scheduling it in steps. But that would mean one step per table — which is messy and hard to maintain. I also saw references to <BeginTransaction> and <CommitTransaction> in XMLA, but it looks like you can’t run multiple transactions in a single XMLA script unless you’re using a SOAP/XMLA client — not SSMS or Invoke-ASCmd.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. Is there a clean way to process each table in its own transaction (automated)?\n2. Is the \"separate transactions\" checkbox in SSIS known to be buggy? Or is there a workaround?\n3. If XMLA is the best approach, how can I structure it to avoid memory crashes without having to create 20+ steps manually?\n\nAny help or experience appreciated\n\n ",

        "author": "Lastrevio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi, I just learned the basics of AWS and I'm thinking of getting my hands dirty and building my first project in it.\n\nI want to call the Spotify API to fetch, on a daily basis, the results of a certain Spotify playlist (haven't decided which yet, but it will most likely be top 50 songs in Romania). From what I know, these playlists update once per day, so my pipeline can run once per day.\n\nThe end goal would be to visualize analytics about this kind of data in some BI tool after I connect to the Athena database, but the reason I am doing this is to practice AWS and to put it as a project on my CV.\n\nHere is how I thought of my data schema so far:\n\nI will have the following tables: f_song, f_song_snapshot, d_artist, d_calendar.\n\nf_song will have an ID as a primary key, the name of the song and all the metadata about the song I can get through Spotify's API (artists, genre, mood, album, etc.). The data loading process for this table will be UPSERT (delta insert).\n\nd_artist will contain metadata about each artist. I am still not sure how to connect this to f_song through some PK-FK pair since a song can have multiple artists and an artist can have multiple songs so I may need to create a new table to break down this many-to-many mapping (any ideas?). I also intend to include a boolean column in this table called \"has_metadata\" for reasons I will explain below. The data loading process will also be upsert.\n\nf_song_snapshot will contain four columns: snapshot_id (primary key), song_id (foreign key to f_song's primary key), timestamp (which represents the date in which that particular song was part of that playlist) and rank (representing the position in the playlist that day from 1 to 50). The data loading process for this table will be ONLY INSERT (pure append).\n\nd_calendar will be a date look-up table that has multiple DATE values and the corresponding day, month, year, month in text, etc. for each date (and it will be connected to f_song_snapshot). I will only load this table once, probably.\n\nNow, how to create this pipeline in AWS? Here are my ideas so far:\n\n1). Lambda function (scheduled to run daily) that calls Spotify's API to get the top 50 songs in that day and all the metadata about them and then dumping this as a JSON file in an S3 bucket.\n\n2). AWS Glue job that is triggered by the appearance of a JSON file in that bucket (i.e.: by the finishing of the previous step) that takes the data from that JSON file and pushes it into f_song and f_song_snapshot. f_song will only be appended if a respective song is not already in it, while f_song_snapshot will *always* be appended. This Glue job will also update d_artist but not all the columns, only the artist_id and artist_name, and only in the cases in which that artist does not already exist, and in the case in which a new artist is inserted, has_metadata will be equal to 0 (false) and all other columns (with the exception of id, name and has_metadata) will be NULL.\n\n3). Lambda function, triggered, by the finishing of the previous step, that makes API calls to Spotify to get the metadata of all the artists in d_artist for whom has_metadata = 0. This information will get dumped as a JSON in another S3 bucket.\n\n4). AWS Glue job that gets triggered by the addition of another file in that artist S3 bucket (by the finishing of the previous step) that updates the rows in d_artist for which has_metadata = 0 with the new information found in the new JSON file (and then sets has_metadata = 1 after it is finished).\n\nHow does this sound? Is there a simpler way to do it or am I on the right track? It's my first time designing a pipeline so complex. Also, how can I connect the M:M relationship between the f_song and d_artist tables?",

I'm using dbt with DuckDB for transformations.\n\nI've been following best practices and have defined a silver base layer where type conversion will be performed (and tested), but I've been a bit underwhelmed by dbt's support for this.\n\nI come from a SQL Server background where I previously implemented a metadata catalog for type conversion in pure SQL - basically storing target strong data types for each field (varchar(20), decimal(38,4), etc.) and then dynamically generating SQL views from the metadata table to do try\\_cast operations, with every field having an error indicator.\n\nIt looks like I can do much the same in a dbt model, but I was hoping to leverage dbt's testing functionality with something like dbt-expectations. What I want to test for:\n\n* Null values in not-null fields\n* Invalid type conversions to decimals/numerics/ints\n* Varchar values exceeding max field lengths\n\nI was hoping to apply a generic set of tests to every single source field by using the metadata catalog (which I'd load via a seed) - but it doesn't seem like you can use Jinja templates to dynamically generate tests in the schema.yml file.\n\nThe best I can do appears to be generating the schema.yml at build time from the metadata and then running it - which tbh isn't too bad, but I would have preferred something fully dynamic.\n\nThis seems like a standard problem, so I imagine my approach might just be off. Would love to hear others' opinions on the right way to tackle type conversions and validation in dbt!",

I know this is generally forbidden in Kimball modeling, but its unclear to me what the right solution should be. \n\n  \nIn my scenario, I need to merge two concept from different sources: Stripe invoices and a Salesforce contracts. A contract maps 1 to many with invoices and this needs to be connected at the line item level, which is essentially a product on the contract and a product on the invoice. Those products do not match between systems and have to be mapped separately. Products can have multiple prices as well so that add some complexity to this. \n\nAs a side note, there is no integration between Salesforce and Stripe, so there is not a simple join key I can use, and of course, theres messy historical data, but I digress.\n\nDoes this relationship between Invoice and Contract merit some type of intermediate bridge table? Generally those are reserved for many to many relationships, but I'm not sure what else would be beneficial. Maybe each concept should be tied to a price record since thats the finest granularity, but this is not feasible for every record as there are tens of thousands and theyd need to be mapped semi manually.\n\n  \n",

        "author": "the_aero_guy",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I am an junior data engineer and I have recently started in a project here at my company. Although it is not a critical project, it is a very good one to improve my abilities in data modeling. So when I dove into it, I have got some questions. My main difficulty here is *how to and what to start thinking of when modeling the data from the original relational model to a start schema data model where it can be used by the dataViz people in PowerBI*.\n\nBelow is a *very* simplified table relationship that I built to illustrate how the source tables are structured.\n\n[Original relational model](https://preview.redd.it/htaxxfp5o38f1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb45d6238590975b76a78cb3676fa2e8089211b3)\n\n*Quick explanation of the original architecture:*\n\nHere, it is a *sort* of snowflake architecture, where the main table is clearly Table A, which stores the main reports (type A). There are also a bunch of tables B's which are from the same type of report (type B) with some columns in common (as seen in the print) but each table has some exclusive columns, which depends of the report the user want to fill (TableB\\_a may have some type of infos that do not need to be filled in TableB\\_d, and so on).\n\nSo for example, when a user creates a main report in TableA in the app interface, they can choose if they will fill any type B report and, if so, which reports of type B they will fill. There must be a type A report and each one of them can have 0 or many type B reports.\n\nEach type B tables can have another two tables:\n\n* one for the participants assigned to the type B report\n* and other to the pictures attached to each of the type B report.\n\nThere are also many other tables seen in the left side of the picture that connects to TableA (such as Activities and tableA\\_docs) and user related tables, like Users, UserCertificate and Groups. Users, specially, connects to almost every other table by the column CreatedBy.\n\n*My question:*\n\nI need to create the new data modeling that will me used in PBI and to do so I will use views (there is not a lot of data, so the performance will not be affected). I actually do not know how to start and which steps I can take to start the modeling. But I have an idea:\n\nI was thinking about using star schema where I will have 2 fact tables (FT\\_TABLE\\_A and FT\\_TABLE\\_B) and some dimension tables around them. For FT\\_TABLEA I may use TableA directly. For FT\\_TABLE\\_B, I was thinking of joining each trio of tables (TableB\\_x - TableB\\_x\\_pics - TableB\\_x\\_participants) and then union them all using the common columns between then. The exclusive columns may be kept to be consulted directly in the original tables since for the dashboard their data is not important).\n\nFor the dimensions, I think i can join Users, Groups and UserCertificate to create DM\\_USERS, for example. The other tables can be used as dimensions directly.\n\nTo link the fact tables between themselves, I can create a DM\\_TA\\_TB, where it will stores the IDs from tables b and the ids from table A (like a hash map).\n\nSo is my approach correct? Did I start well? I really want to understand **which approach I can take** in this kind of project and **how to think** here. I also want to know great references to study (with practical examples, please).\n\nI also do not master some concepts, so I am open to suggestions and corrections.\n\nEDIT: \n\nHere are some of the metrics I need to show:\n\n\\* the status of the reports of Type A and B's (are they open? are they closed?) for each location (lat long data is in TableA and the status is in each TableB) and the map plot to show where each report where filled (independently of the B type of the report)\n\n\\* The distribution plot for the level of criticality: how many B reports for each level (10 for low level, 3 for mid level and 4 for high level) (this will be calculated using the data from the reports)\n\n\\* alerts for activities that are next to deadline (the date info is in TableB)\n\n\\* How many type A and Type B reports are given to each group (and what are their status).\n\n\\* How the Type B are distributed between the groups (for example, Group 1 have more activities related to maintenance while Group 2 are doing more investigations activies)\n\nAnd etc. There are other metrics but these are the main ones\n\nThanks in advance!",

This feels risky. If someone makes a mistake, it can end up in the production environment immediately, especially since the platform (e.g. Hubspot) is actively used.\n\nIn software development, I’m used to working with DTAP (Development, Test, Acceptance, Production) environments. That gives us room to experiment and test safely. I’m wondering how to bring a similar approach to data engineering.\n\nSome constraints:\n\n* We currently have a single datalake that serves as the main source for everyone.\n* There’s no sandbox/staging environment for the external APIs we push data to.\n* Our team sometimes modifies source or destination data directly during dev/testing, which feels very risky.\n* Everyone working on the data environment has access to everything, including production API keys so (accidental) erroneous calls sometimes occur.\n\n**Question:**\n\nHow do others in the data engineering space handle environment separation and safe testing practices? Are there established patterns or tooling to simulate DTAP-style environments in a data pipeline context? \n\nIn our software engineering teams we use mocked substitutes or local fixtures to fix these issues, but seeing as there is a bunch of unstructured data I'm not sure how to set this up.\n\nAny insights or examples of how you’ve solved this—especially around API interactions and shared datalakes—would be greatly appreciated!",

        "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm working on a Python ETL on Databricks, and I've run into a very specific requirement where I feel like I need to interact with Spark's or Hadoop's more \"internal\" methods directly via the JVM.\n\n**My challenge (and my core question):**\n\nI have certain data consistency or atomic operation requirements for files (often Parquet, but potentially other formats) that seem to go beyond standard `write.mode(\"overwrite\").save()` or even the typical Delta Lake APIs (though I use Delta Lake for other parts of my pipeline). I'm looking to implement highly customized **commit logic**, or to directly manipulate the list of files that logically constitute a \"table\" or \"partition\" in a transactional way.\n\nI know that PySpark gives us access to the Java/Scala world through `spark._jvm` and `spark._jsc`. I've seen isolated examples of manipulating `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem` for atomic renames.\n\nHowever, I'm wondering **how exactly am I supposed to use internal Spark/Hadoop methods like** `commit()`**,** `addFiles()`**,** `removeFiles()` **(or similar transactional file operations) through this JVM interface in PySpark?**\n\n* **Context:** My ETL needs to ensure that the output dataset is always in a consistent state, even if failures occur mid-process. I might need to atomically add or remove specific files from a \"logical partition\" or \"table,\" or orchestrate a custom commit after several distinct processing steps.\n* **I understand that solutions like Delta Lake handle this natively**, but for this particular use case, I might need very specific logic (e.g., managing a simplified external metadata store, or dealing with a non-standard file type that has its own unique \"commit\" rules).\n\n**My more specific questions are:**\n\n1. What are the **best practices for accessing and invoking these internal methods** (`commit`, `addFiles`, `removeFiles`, or other transactional file operations) from PySpark via the JVM?\n2. Are there **specific classes or interfaces within** `spark._jvm` (e.g., within `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileFormatWriter` or `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem` APIs) that are designed to be called this way to manage commit operations?\n3. What are the **major pitfalls to watch out for**? (e.g., managing distributed contexts, serialization issues, or performance implications).\n4. Has anyone successfully **implemented custom transactional commit logic in PySpark** by directly using the JVM? I would greatly appreciate any code examples or pointers to relevant resources.\n\nI understand this is a fairly low-level abstraction, and frameworks like Delta Lake exist precisely to abstract this away. But for this specific requirement, I need to explore this path.\n\nThanks in advance for any insights and help!",

Currently, I have 2 offers.\n\n**Job 1:**\n\nMy current company has offered me a Data Engineer with the following tech stack:\n\n**SQL, Python, AWS Redshift, AWS Glue, AWS S3, Airflow, Lambda, Secret Manager, EC2, and Git.** They are also planning to adopt **dbt** soon.\n\n**Job 2:**\n\nI received a BI Developer offer from another company. Based on the job description and discussion with the manager, their tech stack is the following:\n\n**SQL, Python (Pyspark), Azure Databricks, Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure DevOps, SAP BW, SAP BO, Qlik Sense**\n\nAccording to the manager, my responsibilities that align with data engineering work include ELT/ETL pipeline development, as well as data warehouse design and development.\n\nTbh, I’m leaning toward the BI Developer offer from the other company because of better compensation and benefits. With this, I’m concerned that it might affect my chances of moving into a data engineering role in the future. From what I understand, AWS is more in demand than Azure in the current job market in my country.\n\nIf you were in my position, would accepting the job 2 offer still be a good stepping stone toward becoming a Data Engineer?\n\nFor context, I’ve been working as a BI Developer for 4 years:\n\n* Previous company, I used **Azure** for 3 years.\n* Current company, I’ve been working with **AWS** for almost a year.\n\nThank you in advance for your insights!

        "author": "Peppers_16",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "  \n**TL;DR:** Metrics look wrong (e.g. bot traffic), analysts estimate what they *should* be (e.g. “reduce Brazil visits by 20%”), and we apply that adjustment inside the DAG. Now upstream changes break those adjustments. Feels like a feedback loop in what should be a one-way pipeline. Is this ever OK?\n\n# Setup:\n\nGo easy on me — this is a setup I’ve inherited, and I’m trying to figure out whether there's a cleaner or more robust way of doing things.\n\nOur data pipeline looks roughly like this:\n\n**Raw clickstream events**  \n⬇️  \n***Visit-level data*** — one row per user \"visit\", with attributes like country and OS (each visit can have many clicks)  \n⬇️  \n***Semi-aggregated visit metrics*** — e.g., on a given day, `Brazil`, `Android` had `n` visits  \n⬇️  \n**Consumed** in BI dashboards and by commercial analysts\n\nHopefully nothing controversial so far.\n\nHere’s the wrinkle:  \nSometimes, analysts spot issues in the historical metrics. E.g., they might conclude that bot traffic inflated `Brazil/Android` visit counts for a specific date range. But they can’t pinpoint the individual \"bad\" visits. So instead, they estimate what the metric *should* have been and calculate a scalar adjustment (like x0.8) at the aggregate level.\n\nThese adjustment factors are then applied **in the pipeline** — i.e. post-aggregation, we multiply `n` by the analyst-provided factor. So the new pipeline effectively looks like:\n\nRaw clickstream  \n⬇️  \nVisit-level data  \n⬇️  \nSemi-aggregated visit metrics  \n⬇️  \n**Apply scalar adjustments** to those metrics  \n⬇️  \nDashboards\n\nAnalysts are happy: dashboards aren't showing janky year-on-year comparisons etc. \n\n# Why this smells:\n\nBasically, this works until some change has to be re-calculated on past data. \n\nEvery time we make improvements upstream — e.g. reclassify visits based on better geo detection — it changes the distribution of the original aggregates. So suddenly the old adjustment (e.g., “reduce Brazil visits on 2024-01-02 by 20%”) no longer applies cleanly, because maybe some of those Brazil visits are now Mexico.\n\nThat means **the Data Engineering team has to halt and go back to the analysts** to get the adjustments recalculated. And often, those folks are overloaded. It creates a deadlock, basically.\n\nTo me, this feels like a kind of *feedback loop* snuck into a system that’s supposed to be a DAG. We’ve taken output metrics, made judgment-based adjustments, and then re-inserted them *into* the DAG as if they were part of the deterministic flow. That works — until you need to backfill or reprocess.\n\n# My question:\n\nThis feels messy. But I also understand why it was done — when a spike looks obviously wrong, business users don’t want to report it as-is. They want a dashboard that reflects their best estimate of reality.\n\nStill… has anyone found a more sustainable or principled way to handle this kind of post-hoc adjustment? Especially one that doesn’t jam up the pipeline every time upstream logic changes?\n\nThanks in advance for any ideas — or even war stories.",

I want to build something that helps rock climbers better plan their outdoor trips by allowing them to compare locations(s) with each other and with weather data.\n\nHowever, I am at a crossroads.\n\nI can either use Streamlit, a very simple and basic web framework which requires only Python. I've seen examples of websites built on Streamlit and they look okay. They're more prototypes than anything else and seem more geared to data science. However, the time investment looks minimal.\n\nOn the other hand I can invest time learning HTML, CSS and Flask. This is will create a far more professional looking website that would look better on my CV but the time invested in these tools might be better used for actual DE tools like Spark, NoSQL, Kafka etc. I am passionate about data and I like building pipelines and I really don't have any interest in frontend.\n\nBut on the other other hand, what's the likelihood that I need to learn Spark, NoSql, Kafka? People on this sub harp on about how DE is not an entry-level role anyways so would it branching out be more beneficial for someone who's just getting started? Also do employers even look at personal projects?\n\nOn the other other hand, am I just overthinking this and is my ADHD making it hard for me to make a final decision?\n\nThoughts please!",

Eventually, I went back to my original major (computer science), got my associate’s degree, and was accepted into a university to finish my bachelor’s.\n\nThat same month, I moved into a new apartment and met my (now) wife. We hit it off immediately, and after a year of dating, I proposed. Life was moving fast... and for once, in the right direction.\n\nAfter graduation, I spent about a year job hunting. I submitted over 500 applications, spending mornings writing tailored cover letters and revising my resume to match each company’s stack and values.\n\nThe first company to interview me ended up hiring me after three rounds.\n\n1. **Initial screen (google meet)**: resume, background, and intro to the company.\n2. **Technical interview (google meet.. 4 hours!)**: a mix of debugging, CS fundamentals, and even some brain-teaser-style problems (think: goblin guarding a bridge).\n3. **Final interview**: in-person, 3.5 hours away. They covered the hotel, gas, and meals.\n\nComing from 15 years in food service, I had never felt so professionally respected. I know this might be standard for many in tech, but it meant the world to me. I worked hard for it and it finally paid off.\n\nIf you’re out there feeling discouraged, unsure if you’ll ever make it... I’ve been there. More than once. Don’t give up. You’ve got this.",

I've been making almost exclusively C and C++ programs and libraries for a few years now, and never really touched anything else. However, I've recently started trying to make stuff for Android and for the web, and **dear lord it's soo much more complicated**.\n\nThe main problem i have, specially when making Android apps, is that a minimal \"hello world\" example is very complex. I got used to starting with literally 1 file (main.c / cpp), 1 command (the compiler doing its thing), and 1 resulting file (the binary).\n\nWith Android, a minimal working example has dozens of files, a dozen processes running in the background, a dozen dependencies being downloaded while building, and even if you do everything right, sometimes a bug in one of those hundreds of failure points just breaks everything.\n\nA similar situation happens with webdev, though an **actual** minimal project only requires HTML, with most of the complexity existing on the server setup.\n\nI know this sounds like a rant, so here's the actual question: Is there a good reason for this, or is it just a case of an environment evolving badly over time?",

But, honestly, I can't think of any more reason to learn this any further. I keep reading about it's limitations and how there are libraries out there who can help with this stuff and even if I do encounter it at work, won't I just learn it on the job? Won't I just discuss it with a team on how to implement it?\n\nI don't know, I'm new to this so I'm not very sure how to think about this. I see a lot of attention on recursion and all that, but it seems like a solution that only works for such specific and situational problems, or that only works to train the developer to learn to break down problems. I'd love any opinions on this. What do I need recursion for if it seems like it only works in specific situations, most of the time I think a simple while loop will work just fine.

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to put this out there because I’ve been struggling a lot with my growth as a developer and I think I need some external perspective and advice.\n\nI’ve been working as a developer for about 4 years now. Recently graduated with a degree in CS, but most of my college years were during the pandemic—so, let’s just say the education wasn’t the most hands-on or practical.\n\nTo be honest, I feel like I’ve skipped a lot of important steps in my learning journey. I learned (more or less) the basics for starters such as algorithm, datastrucutres and OOP, then jumped straight into building things with frameworks without really understanding the underlying principles or best practices. On top of that, I’ve become overly reliant on AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.). They help me get things done fast, but I’m painfully aware that they’re also masking my gaps in knowledge and critical thinking when it comes to code design, architecture, and problem-solving.\n\nOn the job side, I’ve never worked on a big team. All of my jobs and freelance projects have been solo. I’ve literally never had a code review in my life. No senior devs to learn from. No one to point out my bad habits. As a result, I have no real benchmark for how “good” my code actually is. I’m constantly second-guessing myself—am I writing maintainable code? Am I using the right patterns? Am I leaving massive performance or security issues behind without realizing it?\n\nMy main focus has been backend development—working with NestJS, building REST APIs—that’s the part I actually enjoy the most. But I’ve mostly worked fullstack because that’s what companies have been hiring for. I know I need to broaden my skills—GraphQL, performance tuning, security best practices, proper testing strategies, etc.—but I’m honestly lost on where to start and what’s most important to prioritize.\n\nAnother weakness: I’ve never developed the habit of properly reading and understanding documentation. I’ve mostly been learning through random tutorials, StackOverflow, and now AI. I know this is unsustainable long-term, but every time I sit down to “study” or deep dive, I get overwhelmed and default back to just shipping code.\n\nSo yeah… I guess I’m at a crossroads. I want to level up. I want to break this cycle. But I feel like I’ve built my developer career on shaky foundations and now I don’t know how to rebuild while still working full time.\n\n**If anyone has been through something similar (or has advice on how to build real confidence and technical depth after years of winging it), I’d love to hear your perspective.**\n\nWhat would you focus on first if you were in my shoes? How do I realistically improve my fundamentals while balancing work?\n\nThanks for reading.",

Native Android development for one year before working then I developed some freelancing apps, then I used my android skills to crack some applications on freelancer. Then I moved for full stack development for the best 3 years. I can do different frameworks, I can create beautiful production ready websites using React,...etc.\n\nThe issue is, I still cannot fit myself in any stack. I tried in my free time game development I was stuck because I failed to learn shaders  (I couldn't build a connection with the logic)  \nAlso, I am so bad at designing 3d or 2D. I tried low level coding and contribute to open source projects I got bored fast,...etc. Also, I tried AI for some time got bored fast\n\nI don't know what to do. Whatever field I join I get bored or I be like man that's not my place. The best thing I can do is full stack development but it's boring some random CRUD operations and doing the same security measures over and over.\n\nI hope to get answers from really old dudes in the field.\n\nOne last thing I forgot to mention: I’m currently a full-time software engineer, but I’m not specifically doing full-stack work. Instead, I’m assigned random tasks across many parts of the company’s systems, mostly to avoid getting stuck doing just one thing.\n\nAn Edit, Should I start game development for fun (again), and Will I be able to do something in game engines. I feel like that part can be okay for me",

What would you recommend?\n\nI struggle with keeping myself motivated when it comes to learning theory, but when I'm in an environment that is more structured, with tests and deadlines I'm better at following through, so I've been thinking of enlisting in a couple of classes at my local community college, however as those tend to be pretty expensive, I would like to hear any alternatives you might have.\n\nThank you all!",

I would focus heavily on trying to understand math on a more conceptual level or at least get enough practice to be prepared for theoretical computer science, but I consistently failed when implementing algorithms for projects. \n\nI initially thought this failure came from not understanding the algorithm enough as a concept, and I tried to ask myself at which point I usually get stuck, since I could get through the basics taught in 'intro to java/x language' courses where they introduce variables, data types, pointers, etc.\n\nI tried to ask myself the simplest 'algorithm' I could imagine implementing from scratch- I thought  creating an algorithm to make the number 4 was not complicated, I could make int x =2 and write the following print(x +x). I thought that this analogy proved that any issue I had in terms of reading documentation and implementation came because I needed to reach a point of understanding where the algorithm was as familiar and intuitive as basic arithmetic, but this was not the case as when I asked my professor they said it is more important to focus on understanding the algorithm enough to properly implement it, but there was not enough time within the course to develop too deep of an understanding and such an understanding could not be developed without implementation regardless.\n\n  \nI felt stuck in a catch 22 because I could not move past \"tutorial hell\" due to a lack of theoretical computer science knowledge but I could also not gain computer science knowledge because I had not programmed enough. Even if I reached a rough understanding of how to draw a bubble sort on a whiteboard I didn't understand programming languages enough to write the comparison  statements properly from scratch  and plan for exception cases.\n\n  \nI want to start completely from scratch similar to how you would introduce computer science to a child but am not sure where to start- I even tried scratch but it seemed to be more of a game with algorithm building elements to keep a child's attention rather than an appropriate place for someone to learn about computers and computation from the ground up.

So I started looking around and found tons of unique projects which did not seem possible at all.\n\nHow do you guys build projects from scratch?\n\nFor example, let's say I want to build a music player, so I look into how music players work and stuff, but how do I know what libraries will help me build the project? Do you just go on Google and type \"Libraries in C++ to build a music player\"? How do you know the necessary stuff for the music player to work? Do I just go on YouTube and search \"how do music players work?\" and implement each part by finding the right library for it? How do I know that video didn't dumb down some stuff and now I'm just stuck with a half-assed project?\n\nI want to build projects and stuff, but this is very confusing for me, please guide me.\"",

        "content": "I’ve been working as a software dev for around 5 months. Things are generally going well, my work gets done, and I’ve handled some fairly complex features according to my tech lead. I’ve also worked with pen testers, supported QA, and regularly get asked questions about one of our key new features.\n\nHowever, my confidence keeps taking hits. For example, I recently upgraded our Node containers to Node 22 and updated some code using new JS features. But the cloud builder was still on Node 18, and tests failed. A mid-level dev suggested I talk to DevOps since they own the cloud builder and can proparly upgrade it quite easy, which I did, and I submitted my PRs. The next day, my tech lead upgraded the cloud builders himself and told me that I could’ve done it myself, and explained how to do it.\n\nSomething similar happened a couple of months ago, and I promised to flag such situations earlier, but now I just feel dumb again. These moments hit me hard and make me second-guess myself, even though I’m trying to learn, ask questions, and be proactive.\n\nMy tech lead and manager have both said I’m doing well, and that I should start doing my own features (which I’ve started planning), but when I make mistakes like this, I feel like I am shit.\n\nI know this is likely coming from me more than anyone else, but it doesn’t make it any easier.\n\nHas anyone else felt this way early in their career? How did you deal with it?",

That sounds like an opportunity, but I don't really see a lot of job listings for low-level roles. Not as visible or as frequent as web/backend openings.\n\nSo, I’m wondering:\n\n* Is low-level programming still a viable and a realistic path?\n* How do people usually find jobs in this space? Are they mostly through networking, open source contributions, or something else?\n* Are remote jobs in this field even common, or is being in certain countries a must?\n* How realistic is it to break into this field from Argentina or Latin America in general?\n\nI’m not against going the backend route (which I don't like in any way), but I really enjoy low-level stuff and would love to keep that door open — ideally both as a career and as a serious hobby.\n\nAny guidance, stories, or pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Ideally, I would like to create a wide range of creative projects using both together. Apps, websites, games for consoles, web-based games, AR and VR experiences, and so on. Whatever I get inspired to create. So, the past month or so I've been using online and book resources to try and learn coding on my own. I started with basic HTML, CSS, and entry-level JavaScript. I haven't gone in-depth with anything just yet. Just chipping at studies an hour or so a day.\n\nI wasn't sure if JavaScript would be the best investment as my first coding language for my creative goals. I've been dipping my toes in C# this last week after learning about the recent innovations to C# that covers all the areas I'm interested in listed above. However, I hit a wall trying to setup and implement Visual Studio Code.\n\nWith JavaScript, I could just make a js file in any text-based editor, even notepad, and just go. But C# it feels like I need all these add-ons, libraries, plugins and more just to START learning what I can do besides Console.WriteLine(). I feel like I'm being sold dependency on one specific program than learning a language. That I have to become dependent on Microsoft and the .NET framework just to get anything done in the future, even learn Unity and so forth while moving away from web-based options for creativity.\n\nIs C# always like this? It feels heavy and sluggish compared to the flexible JavaScript. I don't want to use up hours and weeks moving in a direction just to backtrack and have to unlearn it.\n\nAny coding kung-fu masters care to share insights about this? Thanks for any input.",

A friend told me that it was probably a problem with the syntax of my lines, but I write Sysout using Ctrl+Space (to save time), so, it can't be a syntax problem.\n\n\nI'll try to write everything in advance so I can continue the class, but I want to know the real solution to this strange error, if it exists...\n\n                \n\n",

At first, I was excited when I wrote my first function that did basic calculations — it felt amazing to see code do something real.\n\nBut over time, I realized I absolutely hate working with frontend — especially CSS and anything design/UI related. I find myself wasting hours on things I don’t care about, and I feel zero motivation. The problem is, my university only guided us toward web and mobile development, so I never explored other fields.\n\nRecently, I started learning Data Structures and Algorithms with Python, and I'm actually enjoying it a lot. I also liked working on CLI projects — they felt more logical, more like real programming.\n\nI'm still a student and have time to redirect myself before graduation. I want to do something that's:\n- More backend/logic-focused\n- In-demand with good salaries\n- Doesn’t rely on UI/design\n\nFields like DevOps, Cybersecurity, or AI/ML sound interesting, but I don’t know enough about them to choose.\n\n**Any advice from people who went through the same thing?**\nHow did you find your direction?  \nHow can I try out those fields before committing?  \nAny specific resources you'd recommend for someone who loves problem-solving but hates design?\n\nThanks in advance!",

I don’t have much prior experience although I did learn some HTML and Python back in school, but I’ve forgotten most of it, so I’m essentially starting from scratch.\n\nThe good thing is that I’m completely free until the end of July (will be joining college after that), so I want to make the most of this time and give it my full focus. I do have a few questions and would appreciate your advice:\n\n1. What should be my ideal roadmap or study plan to cover CS50 efficiently in this time frame?\n2. How many hours should I ideally dedicate each day, considering I want to complete as much as possible before July ends?\n3. Are there any particular lectures or concepts that generally require extra attention or are tougher to grasp?\n4. Would you recommend taking notes? If yes, should I write down everything the professor says, or focus on key points? Also, is it better to keep digital notes or go old-school with pen and paper (I don't have prior experience of making digital notes but I need to learn)?\n5. How does submission of problem sets and projects work?\n6. Are there any specific tools or software I need to install beforehand?\n7. How does the free certificate process work? Is it automatic or do I need to register separately?\n8. Any extra advice, personal experiences, or tips you’d like to share would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks a lot in advance! Would love to hear from folks who’ve completed or are currently taking the course.",

        "content": "It's the summer after HS graduation, right before I enter my first semester of University in my Data Science major. I thought, \"Maybe I should learn code before anything else, get ahead, and make some time for math when I'm actually in uni. My 11th-grade Pre-cal teacher recommended learning code first even.\" There weren't many free online structured courses for learning Python that had hands-on practice but I did find Kaggle.\n\n  \nI completed the short \"Intro to Programming\" course on there with relative ease. Some exercises were mildly tricky but I was able to get through them with minimal hints and criticism from ChatGPT. After that, I headed onto the main Python course. This was also relatively easy in the first few topics but when it got to lists, list comprehension, dictionaries, for loops and stuff, the exercises became increasingly difficult. The reading part before the exercises page weren't the hardest to understand and I even tried my best to truly understand the content. I would try a code first, see if it's correct, if it isn't, I send it to ChatGPT to see what's wrong with it without providing a hint to the solution, and try again. I'd even uncomment the \"q.solution()\" to see the solution when I'd given up after hours of head banging, trying to figure this out. I'd check out the solution, read through it line by line to see what the hell it's even doing and how it makes sense, not get it, send it to ChatGPT to explain it in practice, still get confused, explain bit by bit, go back, solve the same problem, move on to the next problem, and struggle with even getting *started*. I've been *especially* stuck on the \"Exercise: Strings and Dictionaries\" on problems 2 and 3. holy hell\n\n  \nI can not even think of what to start with, I can not brainstorm. I've heard the advice \"just code dumb stuff that pertains to the problem, fix it, expand it, and slowly work towards the solution\" but I feel like I can't even code dumb stuff either.\n\n  \nI thought maybe Kaggle goes to quick with questions that go from simple syntaxes, to abstractions of those syntaxes, and then abstractions UPON abstractions on those syntaxes that just overload my working memory. \n\n  \n**Is Kaggle actually the problem? Or am I approaching this terribly wrong?**",

However, to me, what they call \"opinion-based\" questions are the most interesting type of questions and they tackle the problem of possible ways of solving something.\n\nI'm a newbie programmer. I'm developing a C# program. My program has a Configuration class, where I basically need only 1 instance of the object for an entire run of the program, which tells me the class could be designed as a Singleton. However, there is a twist. My program is able to do calculations. A calculation takes some while to complete. My program can only do 1 calculation at a time, but it is possible to set multiple calculations in a queue. A calculation requires the Configuration. When I set a calculation in a queue, I want to take a \"snapshot\" of the state of the Configuration at the specific time, therefore create some sort of a copy of the Configuration. Now my question is - does this go against the Singleton principle? \n\nPlease be lenient with me. As I say, I'm a newbie, not a C# world champion, so some constructive points would really help me. Thank you very much for any recommendations.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I’m a student currently working on a research project with my group, and we want to build a simple GIS-based website as part of it. The project involves displaying spatial data and helping users make decisions based on environmental and ecological information that we'll be collecting.\n\nThe website should ideally display interactive maps that we’ll generate using QGIS. None of us have any background in web development, but we’re willing to learn from scratch.\n\nWe're hoping to:\n\n-Show GIS maps (exported from QGIS) on a webpage\n-Allow users to toggle between different map layers\n-Host the site for free (possibly using GitHub Pages)\n-Eventually expand the tool with more features like search or data input\n\n\nCan anyone recommend a beginner-friendly, step-by-step learning path to help us achieve this?\n\nAlso, realistically speaking — is it feasible to learn the basics and build a working prototype within 1 to 2 weeks? We don’t expect it to be perfect, but we want something functional enough to showcase our idea.\n\nWould really appreciate any advice, tips, or resource links from people who’ve done something similar. Thanks in advance!",

If I'm taking in html form input though the express.urlencoded middleware, what do I need to watch out for? \n\nI know I should validate the input format with something like the express-validator middleware, but what about for something like a text-area where a user might have a perfectly valid reason for including \"dangerous characters\"? \n\nI've tried escaping/encoding the input, but at least with the express-validator `.escape()` method, this literally displays the output as encoded symbols. I've discovered that if I don't use `.escape()` and just display the content in the view either with the `.textContent` DOM method or with a templating engine like ejs, it will display the proper text content on the page and literally display any `<script>` or other html tags instead of running the code inside of them. However, is there still a risk of an attacker manipulating the code on the back-end if I don't escape the input?\n\nFinally, I know I should use parameterization for Postgresql queries. Will this alone protect my database from SQL injection (I'm use node-postgres for queries)?\n\nThank you for your responses and assistance.",

My ultimate goal is to get into the AI/ML field, and I’ll have 3 years during MCA to build my skills.\n\nI’ve been researching roadmaps, and most of them recommend Python and strong math foundations—which actually works well for me since I studied a lot of math in depth during my BSc. So I started learning Python and brushing up on math side by side.\n\nI also spoke to my cousin who works at Boeing as a full-stack developer. He told me that full-stack/frontend/backend roles are getting saturated, and if I'm starting fresh, AI/ML is a better long-term direction. That motivated me even more to stick to this field.\n\nHowever, a friend of mine told me that companies don't just want Python developers. He said that languages like C++ and Java are often preferred too, and since Python is more \"readymade,\" it might not be enough alone. He suggested learning C++ or Java first, then Python later—which has left me confused.\n\nNow I’m also wondering—should I be open to development roles too? Like learning full-stack or backend frameworks (Django, React, etc.) along with Python and AI/ML stuff? Or should I just stay focused on AI/ML and not try to juggle too many things at once?\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation—coming from a non-CS background and aiming for AI/ML? I'd really appreciate any guidance, suggestions, or roadmaps.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "content": "Hey all,\n\nI’m 44 and have been working in IT support for the past 4 years. It’s been a steady job, but I’ve hit a point where I really want to progress, earn a better salary, and feel like I’m actually growing in my career. The problem is — I feel completely stuck and unsure of the right direction to take.\n\nI dabbled in web development years ago (HTML, CSS, a bit of jQuery) and had a couple of jobs back in the 2010-12s, but tech has moved on so much since then. Now I’m looking at everything from JavaScript frameworks like React, to modern build tools, version control, APIs, and responsive design — and honestly, it feels like a huge mountain to climb. I worry I’ve left it too late.\n\nPart of me thinks I should go down the cloud or cybersecurity route instead. I’ve passed the AZ-900 and looked into cloud engineering, but I only know the networking basics and don’t feel that confident with scripting or using the CLI. AWS also seems like a potential direction, but I’m just not sure where I’d thrive.\n\nTo complicate things, I suspect I have undiagnosed ADHD. I’ve always struggled with focus, information retention, and consistency when learning. It’s only recently I’ve realized how much that could be holding me back — and making this decision even harder.\n\nWhat triggered all this is seeing someone I used to work with — he’s now a successful cyber engineer in his 20s. It hit me hard. I know it’s not healthy to compare, but I can’t help feeling like I’ve missed the boat.\n\nI’m torn:\n\t•\tIs web dev too layered and overwhelming to break into now?\n\n\t•\tCan someone like me still make a comeback and get hired in this field?\n\n\t•\tOr should I pivot to something more structured like cloud or cyber, where maybe the learning path is clearer?\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice from those who’ve been through a similar fork in the road — especially if you’ve changed paths later in life or dealt with ADHD while trying to upskill.\n\nThanks for reading.

Copilot in my editor, ChatGPT open in one tab, pasting console errors like it was a team member. But now? I’m kinda over it.\n\nSomewhere between the half-correct suggestions, the weird variable names, and the constant second-guessing, I realized I was spending more time editing than coding. Not in a purist way, just… practically speaking. I’d ask for a function and end up rewriting 70% of what it gave me, or worse, chasing down subtle bugs it introduced.\n\nThere was a week I used it heavily while prototyping a new internal service. At first it felt fast code was flying. But reviewing it later, everything was just slightly off. Not wrong, just shallow. Error handling missing. Naming inconsistent. I had to redo most of it to meet the bar I’d expect from a human.\n\nI still think there’s a place for these tools. I’ve seen them shine in repetitive stuff, test cases, boilerplate, converting between formats. And when I’m stuck at 10 PM on a weird TypeScript issue, I’ll absolutely throw a hail mary into GPT. But it’s become more like a teammate you work with occasionally, not one you rely on every day.\n\nJust wondering if there are other folks feeling this too? Like the honeymoon phase is over, and now we’re trying to figure out where AI actually fits into the real-world workflow?\n\nNot trying to dunk on the tools. I just keep seeing blog posts about “future of coding” and wondering if we’re seeing a revolution or just a really loud beta.",

There were large gaps between all those contracts.\n\nAs for my educational background, I have a bachelor's degree with a math major and minors in physics and computer science, and a post-graduate certification in data science.\n\nMy issue is this: I see generative AI as contributing to the ruination of society, and I do not want any involvement in that. The problem is that the entirety of the tech industry is moving toward generative AI, and it seems like if you don't have AI skills, then you will be left behind and will never be able to find a job in the CS field. Am I correct in saying this?\n\nAs far as my disgust for the tech industry as a whole: It's not just AI that makes me feel this way, but all the shit the industry has been up to since long before the generative AI boom. The big tech CEOs have always been scumbags, but perhaps the straw that broke the camel's back was when they pretty much all bent the knee to a world leader who, in additional to all the other shit he has done and just being an overall terrible person, has multiple times threatened to annex my country.\n\nIs there any hope of me getting a decent CS career, while making minimal use of generative AI, and making no actual contribution to the development of generative AI (e.g. creating, training, or testing LLMs)? Or should I abandon the field entirely? (If the latter, then the question of what to do from there is probably beyond the scope of this subreddit and will have to be asked somewhere else.)",

Without much context or follow-up, the email stated:\n\n**“Please complete no later than 3 days from the time of this email.”**\n\nIt didn’t matter when I saw the message or what I had going on--they expected urgency and precision on my end. It was already late in the recruiting season, but since they were a YC startup, I decided to give it a shot. I put in \\~30 hours of focused work. They asked for a full-stack AI copilot that integrates with Google Drive, retrieves relevant snippets, and could be tested by their team, which is an insane task to do in 3 days imo. I still attempted to build it, recorded a video walkthrough, sent them a GitHub invite as requested, and submitted it all on time.\n\nNo response. Not after 3 days. Not after 7. They didn’t even accept the GitHub invite.  \n\nIt’s disappointing--especially when they pushed for urgency and responsiveness, but couldn’t extend even basic courtesy in return. I feel like I wasted so much time. I wouldn’t be nearly as frustrated if they had just ignored my application from the start. What stings is that they did respond, assigned an extremely demanding task, and then completely disappeared. Even a simple rejection email would've been good.\n\nBehind every resume is a real person with real commitments. I was proud of what I built, and getting ghosted like this felt incredibly disrespectful. Venting to the people around me helped but they also couldn't believe that the company would simply choose not to respond.

        "content": "Now to start, I will say AI is a fantastic tool. It makes development cycles much much faster. Things that I thought would originally take weeks now take days. That said, the more and more I am using AI for coding, my initial awe at the technology continues to wear off, and now claims that coding will be dead or SWE will go extinct seem far-fetched or overly optimistic at best.\n\nAfter working on some stuff for the past few months, for the initial MVP or demo or prototype, I was always able to spin up something decent with AI. However, when I would create stuff even on the scale of just a few hundred or few thousands of users, I would notice that things would start to break down, and AI actually missed a lot of things during development such as:\n\n  \n1. Performance Optimization: AI won't immediately implement stuff like caching systems, pagination, and database design optimization or indexing without explicitly being told. Let's take caching for example. I wanted to cache results on a page to speed up load times and reduce unnecessary queries to the database. I gave the AI a file for a page to implement caching for and it did it, but then I realized that there was a design flaw that didn't lead to the best UX (when user is performing mutation actions, it seems like the page wasn't being updated until the cache expired so I should clear or update the cache on those actions). Now this may seem like something trivial to a developer, but I doubt a non-technical person using AI would be able to catch these details, know what files to edit, and spin up something fully optimized. Tldr here is that if I just pretty much let AI create my whole app for me, I would end up with something incredibly non-optimized, slow, and would have poor user experience for a larger audience. \n\n2. UI/UX: A lot of people think that frontend will be the first to go. Yes, AI can currently basically zero/one-shot landing pages and basic crud apps. But when these apps need to scale to at least hundreds of thousands of people, and stuff like device responsiveness and accessibility or other UI/UX features becomes important, AI is not giving you solutions out-of-the-box unless it's guided. I came across this [UI/UX benchmark](https://www.designarena.ai) to compare different models, and models today do struggle at really creating production/professional sites, though vibe coding might suffice for a marketing site or hobby app.   \n  \nThose are a few things I noticed, but there are even more things that I mentioned such as infrastructure and systems design, security, etc. that AI isn't getting right yet on its own, and I would be surprised if a person with little-to-no programming experience could ensure are implemented correctly. \n\nNow of course, what exactly software engineers do will change (and it already has), but I still think SWEs will still need to serve as an \"architect\" for the AI while the AI takes the role of the \"construction worker\" or \"builder\". We have seen what happens when we allow bad architects to design buildings and infrastructure (people lose their lives). The same should probably apply to who we have use AI to design crucial systems.   \n  \n ",

        "content": "Edit: I can't edit the title, but I want to be specific. I don't mean the bubble will pop as in Gen AI will go away. Gen AI is never going away. I mean the bubble around creating chat applications or other Gen AI applications that are just wrappers around models from the big 4-5 companies. \n\nI want to get some opinions from people who know this field. People who work in the trenches every day. \n\nI work at a small company (or I did, I'm in the process of being laid off). They do contracts for small companies, and some sub contracting for the government. My Ceo, my CTO, and the head of software engineering are all obsessed with Gen AI, agentic frameworks. They are having us build internal tools to create our own chatbot, that they want to market out to other companies and sell. \n\nThe other day, we were working on a translation \"tool\" within the mcp architecture. One of our senior devops guys, who is very smart and great at the job, asked point blank \"why would a company want this service can't they just ask chatgpt to translate the document?\" The answer, right now, is that chatgpt is a black box. You don't really have any concept of auditibility, how long it actually took to translate the document, what it cost, how accurate it is, etc, just using chatgpt. \n\nWhen you use tools like Langchain and Langfuse with an LLM engine you can track these things. Today, this is useful and I understand the business argument for doing it. \n\nBut to me it feels like a giant bubble waiting to pop. All we are doing, and anyone else claiming to have a chatbot or agentic system, is putting a wrapper on llms developed by the big 4-5 companies. This seems unsustainable to me as a business model. Let's say tomorrow, Anthropic comes out and says now we have an agentic tool that works directly with Claude models, it's configured to work with them out of the box, and it includes full tracing and auditibility of everything you do. And then 2 months later, Open AI releases their competing tool. \n\nWhy then would anyone use a bunch of cobbled together 3rd party tools to accomplish the same thing, instead of just signing deals with one of those companies? \n\nI feel that once that happens, and I am positive it will happen, the whole ecosystem around agentic applications/MCP/chat applications will collapse. Does this sound crazy to everyone? I'd love to hear some opinions. ",

        "content": "I applied to Apple about a month ago for an LLVM GPU Compiler Engineer position. For context, I currently work at Intel as an LLVM Compiler Engineer (3yrs here, 7yrs total experience), working almost exclusively on the optimizing middle-end. Plenty of CPU experience, but not much GPU experience, which I was upfront about and they were totally fine with throughout the process.\n\nOver the course of 4 weeks or so, I went through a pretty grueling hiring process (1 manager screen, 1 technical screen, 4 technical interviews + 1 behavioral interview) that mostly seemed to go well. Hiring manager seemed impressed by my personal projects and professional experience, and the interviewers all seemed like smart and capable people. At this time, I'm also in a process with Qualcomm for a CPU LLVM Engineer position and they also seem very interested (though I'm a bit skeptical of them, tbh the team seemed very demoralized and overworked). At this point, Apple said they want to move forward and we're in the offer phase.\n\nI just had a conversation with the recruiter this morning just checking the team was something I was interested in and starting the conversation about salary expectations. I told him I like the team and I'm very interested in what Apple has to offer. However, when I told him I'm expecting something in the base pay range of $200k - $250k he seemed very shocked. He used the phrase \"strongly misaligned\" on salary expectations. I told him the truth: I'm currently making close to the middle of that range at Intel, plus stock and bonuses (about another $20-40k). I panicked a little when I heard that, so I backpedaled a bit and told him that compensation wasn't necessarily the most important factor and hopefully it wouldn't be an impediment to them making an offer. He said he'll need to talk to the senior hiring manager and get back to me.\n\nI have another call scheduled with him tomorrow to talk again, but I'm worried I screwed up. The online posting says the base pay range is between $175,800 and $312,200, so I don't think I highballed them or made a ridiculous offer. I understand experience may be a mitigating factor, but I'm still really worried. Intel has been doing really poorly since I started working here, and while I like the work overall and have a good relation with my manager, working with my team can be pretty exhausting, and the layoffs have taken a heavy toll. All in all, I'm ready to get out.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks if you've read this far.",

I work for a company that rhymes with Bamazon. \n\nMy relationship with my manager has always been rocky - he has a non-technical background and is currently only an L5. I've spoken to my Sr. SDE and others for advice - they have also had issues with him prior, being very assertive and not taking differing opinions well. I will admit that I can be very combative/vocal (I'm American, he's international).\n\nNevertheless, from 2024 to 2025, I was top of the team in code output and was getting “promo-track” feedback every 1:1. However, long story short, we've had a series of increasingly bad arguments that have broken our relationship: \n\n*  Early Jan, I pushed back on my manager’s micro-managing, and he got angry, called me into a meeting immediately\n* He's called me \"defensive\", \"lacking ownership\", and having a \"victim mentality\" for asking for examples for growth areas during end-of-year reviews\n* I started documenting 1:1s with emails, and he said it felt overly formal and asked me to stop\n* He prevented me from mentoring an intern because he \"didn't trust me\" after I told him not to micromanage me again in April\n\nI escalated to my skip last week because it was affecting my mental health. During my meeting with my skip, he even said (verbatim), \"Your manager has a very, very big ego and is hard to work with, it's not just you\". My skip just had a meeting with me today and said that all the managers (my manager, him, and their manager) met and discussed allowing me to transfer to a sister team, effective immediately, as a change of scenery and environment.\n\nI desperately need help as to what to do here. I'm just very burnt out from the situation and want to leave. I feel like I failed somehow and want to quit. \n\nHere are my options:\n\n1. Transfer under sister team now (new tech stack, new manager)\n1. Stay, wait for focus + pivot, trigger FMLA \n1. Stay, invoke FMLA ASAP for mental health\n\nI'm really just done with this company and want to go for option 3. All thoughts appreciated, feeling boxed in.\n\nEdit w/ Update:\nEnded up choosing option 1 thanks to everyone’s advice. Felt like a rock has lifted off my chest really. Went around and gave notice to those on my team whom I’m close with, it was nice but bittersweet 🥲 They all agreed I made the right choice, lamenting they should all do something collectively to complain against the manager.",

        "content": "I have been a software engineer for 13 years now. I've been web frontend focused since 2019 since I took a liking to it at the end of my first job. Anyway, my career has had its ups and downs, but it feels way way down right now.\n\nMy career was going pretty well until I got laid off in March, 2023. Since then I have had two jobs, and both ended poorly. I am currently unemployed yet again, but unlike previous job searches, I am not feeling hopeful this time.\n\nOne of my last two jobs ended with being fired and my previous one ended with resignation. Both lasted less than 1 year. I felt productive at both jobs, and I made an effort to help less experienced devs. However, after a while, I would inevitably clash with leadership and not behave that well, and the reasons were different at the two companies.\n\nAt one, I felt overly constrained by controlling product managers and wasn't able to make any code change that was not ticketed, since every single PR needed manual QA before being merged into prod. I felt that the React code was the worst I'd ever seen, such as ~25 components that were 1000+ lines long. One component had an ENORMOUS switch statement for conditional rendering that I badly wanted to refactor, but it wasn't a business priority. I also wanted to introduce tests since there weren't any at all, but it wasn't a business priority. Anyway, after trying to take initiative on these things and being blocked, I handled things without much tact, empathy, or whatever else is necessary to maintain good relations with people. Eventually I was fired.\n\nThe most recent job I thought was going to be better. It took me 7.5 months to get it and I liked the industry it was in and the novelty of the service they offered. The code was better than at the other company, and there was more room to make code changes I felt were important to make (after making a Jira ticket myself first). About midway through I got to greenfield a frontend for an internal software overhaul, and it was pretty cool honestly. But then the head of engineering was fired and never replaced, and another engineer that I got to know somewhat was fired without backfill. At one point I was split between a new modern website the company was building and the greenfield internal project, which signaled that I was valuable, but I also couldn't handle it. We had only two frontend devs, myself and a more junior person, working on two huge projects, both rewrites meant to modernize software that had been tried and true for 15+ years.\n\nI was in a good position on the one hand, but on the other I just got burned out. Both projects had unrealistic deadlines given our dev resources. Engineering leadership felt non-existent since the fired head was never replaced. I couldn't balance the responsibilities with the rest of my life, which includes daughters aged 1 and 3.\n\nThen, since I was so frustrated by what was happening, I told the Owner/Founder of the company, who also wrote most of the original code, that we weren't going to hit the deadline, plus some other thoughts. He actually was open to what I was saying and he ended up convening a 2 hour meeting where we changed course with the internal project, and he thanked me for speaking up. I should have felt good about this, but everyone else on the project looked upset with me. At some point, it became clear to me they didn't approve of what I did for some reason, and they wouldn't tell me why, or in some cases talk to me at all. This became an unbearable situation for me and I ended up resigning.\n\nThroughout these two experiences, I had a lot of negative thoughts and kind of vented at people more than is helpful. Looking back, my intentions and my technical performance seem fine, but I just went about it all in a disruptive and heavy-handed way. I wanted to bring about change, but I didn't want to be patient in the process, and I assumed ill intent by others when it probably could have been explained by incompetence, ignorance, or simply an unfortunate set of circumstances.\n\nNow I'm in this all too familiar position of lacking employment. AI is ravaging all except senior+ positions, and my two shots at senior responsibilities did not go well on the whole. I can probably get there, but it would take more time than I have to invest, realistically. The amount of coaching, therapy, preparation, and practice I'd need to land a job, and more importantly to succeed in it, feels overwhelming. We don't have much help with the kids, and daycare is WAY too expensive.\n\nWhat's the path now? It's not like it once was where the only huge hurdle was passing an interview. I've failed at two roles now, even if I feel there were positive aspects. I've replayed the reasons for these outcomes dozens of times in my head, and the positive things too, but the poor end results remain.",

        "content": "So, 10 months ago I made this post:\n\n[How do I get my first job as a self-taught software developer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1evuuo5/how_do_i_get_my_first_job_as_a_selftaught/)\n\nAt the time, I was beyond frustrated. I had nearly two decades of experience building all kinds of things. From game engines to low-level graphics to machine learning, but no degree, no big-name companies on my resume, and most of my freelance work was under NDA, so I couldn’t even show it off publicly. Since then, I learned to approach things differently: I started using platforms like LinkedIn more actively, did a bit of networking, and made a point of showing off my skillset.\n\nThe post got downvoted pretty heavily. A lot of people didn’t like how I phrased things or maybe didn’t believe someone in my situation could be skilled.  \nWhatever the reason, I got the message: *“You’re not supposed to complain. Just stay in your lane.”*\n\n***But here’s the update:*** I landed a job as an Embedded Software Engineer.\n\nOver the summer, I was approached by three companies. What changed was how I presented myself. I started using LinkedIn actively, and Premium honestly helped me get visibility. On top of that, I shared more of my personal projects and made my skills visible.\n\nOne company I haven’t heard back from yet. For another, the recruiter told me the position was put on hold but asked if they could reach out again when hiring resumed. For the third, I made it deeper into the interview stages.\n\nI was told there were other applicants, most of whom had degrees, but I still ended up getting the offer at the top of the pay range they advertised. The role is Embedded Software Engineer, and honestly it’s a higher-level position than I expected to land right out the gate, but one I’m confident stepping into.\n\nWhat helped most was having solid personal projects to point to. During the technical interview, I didn’t have any trouble with the questions, and the team lead seemed to get a good impression of me fairly quickly.\n\nIf you’re self-taught and don’t have a degree, the most useful advice I can give is to make your work visible. Start publishing your projects on GitHub, put together a simple portfolio website, and make sure you’re using LinkedIn. If you’re able to afford Premium, it was surprisingly helpful during my job search and the only reason I used it was because they gave me a free trial.\n\nWhat really got the process moving was a recruiter reaching out based on the broad strokes of my resume. Once someone technical took a closer look at what I’d done, things moved quickly from there.\n\n\n\nI do want to ask though: \n\nWhy did it seem like people hated my original post so much? I can guess and make inferrences, but I would like to know. It was sort of discouraging and I did shift my focus for a little while as a result, but things went really differently on this last hunt just from some strategic changes.",

Why should they program in natural languages over the programming languages they are already productive in? It, also, causes learning loss in new programmers like handing a calculator to a kid learning arithmetic.\n\nIf you are selling the ability to program in natural language to non-programmers, you need a much more mature product that generates and maintains production-grade code because non-programmers don’t understand architecture or how to maintain or debug code.\n\nIf you are selling the ability to automate repetitive tasks, how is GenAI superior to a vast amount of tooling already on the market?\n\nThe only application that makes sense to me is a “buddy” that does tasks you are not proficient at - generating test cases for programmers, explaining code etc. But, then, it has limits in how good it is.\n\nIt appears companies have decided to buy into a product that is not fully mature and can get in the way of getting work done.

I consistently make mistakes and fail to see certain test cases (I work with highly intricate legacy code) and break customers. I feel that my wins at this company are few and far between while my mistakes are constantly haunting me.\n\nI feel that my manager (and other higher up devs) have lost all trust in me and I'm worried about losing my job—I don't have any indication that this is the case, but it's just a feeling I have. I don't have much motivation anymore and even if I do somehow muster some up, another mistake is right around the corner to knock me back down. I do pretty well with correcting my mistakes as soon as possible, but I'm not sure that matters much.\n\nI also feel that my mistakes are so amateur at times that I wonder what I'm even doing in this career—I feel that I'm just not smart enough for this field. My confidence in myself feels like it's at an all time low in just about every aspect of my life now. I know this seems like a case of imposter syndrome, but I think I'm beyond that at this point.\n\nI'm making this post because I'm coming off of a couple of dumb recent mistakes and I'm pretty overwhelmed and demoralized at the moment. I guess I could just use some advice and maybe some other perspectives on how after 5 years at this job, I've somehow seemed to have regressed. Anyone else feel this way (or felt this way before)?

I'd love any advice on:\n\n1. Anything I should do on the first day to create a good, lasting impression?\n2. Beyond coming early, leaving late, and generally working my ass in-person and at home these first few months, is there anything else I can do to shine?\n3. Any pitfalls that you wish you'd have known about?\n4. Is there anything you wish you’d have known when you started your first SWE position?\n\nI'd love any advice—even if it seems super basic/obvious.

I contributed to core distributed systems work and overall would say I had a strong start to my career.\n\nUnfortunately I left without another job lined up, mostly due to burnout and a family tragedy (my brother passed away). When this initially happened I tried to push through and keep the job anyway but once I had some level of financial cushion to support it I thought that thought a year or two out of the workforce would help me process some of the grief I was feeling day to day. The time off ended up lasting longer than I anticipated because it hasn’t been exactly easy to get hired again. I’m actively rebuilding momentum — applying to jobs, prepping for interviews, working on side projects, reconnecting with mentors, and I also got accepted into an MS CS program this fall (with a focus on AI/ML).\n\nThe gap will be around 2–3 years total by the time I’m back in full swing. I’m not sure whether to focus fully on grad school or keep pushing hard for jobs now. Part of me worries I burned too much credibility by leaving when I did and being out this long.\n\nSo here’s my question:\nHas anyone here come back successfully from a gap like this? Do hiring managers actually give people like me a second shot, or should I expect to start from a lower level (if I get hired at all)?\n\nAny blunt or realistic advice is appreciated. Thanks.\n\nEdit/Context: I had 2 YOE including an internship at the same company before taking the gap.",

Right now, I’m working in one of the top ML labs in Europe under a well known prof. I’m part of a joint project with a big pharma company for cancer drug discovery LLM. \n\nBefore this, I did a research internship on protein design using Transformers (similar to AlphaFold) at an institute here, and another ML Research Engineer internship at a biotech startup in Toronto, which I got by cold emailing them.\n\nThe problem is, my current contract ends in December, and I don’t know what’s next. I didn’t get into the master’s program at my own school, and I’m not sure I’ll get into Waterloo either.\n\nMost of the people (PhDs) in our lab have published at top conferences, they’re doing internships at like Anthropic, DeepMind, Meta AI, etc.\nI asked my prof if I could work on a theoretical ML paper and he said yes. The PhD girl I’m supposed to work with is on an internship, so I’m gonna be doing most of it alone. Although knowing the lab's track record we should be able to get it published in top conferences.\n\nI started doing Leetcode a couple months ago for the first time, tbh its not that bad.  But regardless, I feel too researchy for many engineering jobs, but also not experienced enough for industry research roles.\n\nI had a recruiter reach out from DE Shaw Research (the hedge fund's biomedical arm) and after the interview he was like you're too research focused for a data engineer position and dont have a PhD for a researcher positions.\n\nI'm in Switzerland right now, where most of my network is but because of their immigration laws the government won't approve a work permit even if i find a job, and I don’t really know anyone working in ML back in Canada outside of academia. Since my profs network is predominantly the big AI companies im not sure id be able to get far even if he could get me an interviews with any of them which itself is a huge \"if.\"\n\nI feel like im racing against the clock with no options left.\n\nTLDR: Too ML research focused without grad school and underqualified for regular SWE and non-ML DS.",

I thought I did badly because I didn’t actually have any working code but walked through my thought process. I actually passed and moved on to the next step.\n\nThe next step is 1 technical screen, 2 coding, 1 architecture and design, and a behavioral interview. So what should I expect for the next coding interviews? I’m sort of confused because they say study LeetCode problems, but they also said that for the last interview, and that wasn’t LeetCode and was more JavaScript problems. Also, if they are LeetCode, do you have to have a working solution to continue, or is talking through the code and writing some code enough? I’m not good with LeetCode; this is the first time I have ever done this before. I never did them in college. What should I expect? Is this supposed to be extremely more difficult?",

Currently I'm interested to continue progressing as an IC but I have zero interest in management, because I hate having to have that responsibility and sitting in meetings all day long sounds horrid.\n\nMy concern though is that above senior, it seems your responsibilities end up becoming cross-team. With that sounds like a lot of stress. The people I work closely with that are above senior seem like they're always busy throughout the day and even get pinged oftentimes post 5 or 6PM. Feels like they always have a ton on their plate to do both in terms of coding, designs, attending meetings, etc. And the ones I know even still feel like their output outside of meetings is high. Like their brain is just completely on for the entirety of the work day, something I cannot do.\n\n\nI hope to progress above Senior but I don't want to have to sacrifice a ton of WLB for that. Currently I enjoy my WLB. I work remotely, start at like 9-9:30 and end at 5-6, depending on if I have impromptu meetings (my personal policy is end independent work at 5 but if someone needs to meet with me I can stretch until 6, especially since my team is in CT or PST). I completely ignore any pings before/after and that's not a problem. I feel like with my current workload in my team and company, I can progress in my career while still having sufficient brain breaks throughout the day, and at least in my team, there's good support and little pressure.\n\n\nAt risk of sounding greedy, my current TC is around like $200k~ but I hope to reach like $300k+ in <7 years, without having to kill myself with work and stress for it. I also have problems with anxiety which is pretty bad in high-pressure, hectic environments that I assume a lot of higher level engineers have to deal with given their responsibilities. I know other companies can pay that amount of mid-level and seniors...but they also work you to the bone. I want to know if my prospects are too idealistic, hence why I'm asking if engineers above senior here can pitch in and let me know how their WLB experiences have been like. Obviously it's company and team dependent but I assume there's a level of similarity between companies given a similar breadth and depth of responsibilities.\n\n\nAnd I guess a second question to my main one is if you guys think (if you can even predict the future) that the answers to my first question are even relevant like 7+ years down the line.",

A big part of it is rebuilding basket pages into our own tags, storing the data in cookies (encoded), and then decoding and extracting that information to use within overlays. We do a lot of function-based scripting inside our custom tag framework.\n\nWhile the work is quite technical and logic-heavy, we don’t use tools like Git or VS Code — everything is done in a more limited environment. There are three of us on the team, but realistically only two of us are carrying the workload, and it’s been like that for the past three years I’ve been here.\n\nTo make things worse, the pay is barely above minimum wage, which is incredibly disheartening given the responsibility and effort we put in. I feel overworked, undervalued, and burnt out.\n\nI want to move on, but I’m unsure of where I stand. Should I only be applying for junior roles, or does my experience qualify me to aim for mid-level positions? More than anything, I just hope that my next role doesn’t drain me the way this one has. 😦",

I am not counting the browsers and other apps.\n\nI find this extremely exhausting and tiresome to even test one feature since everything needs to be in sync. This really makes me lose my sanity with each flow I run, show to the general public at work, but then I actually need to correct my findings since I noticed a bug in one of the patches in one of the repos.

        "content": "I got my first dev job after college by basically just saying I had taken a few classes on LLVM. I spent my time there working on an AI compiler stack (Torch-MLIR) doing relatively menial things like implementing ops and fixing packaging issues. After 2 years with the company, it got bought by AMD. The team's focus shifted away from the flagship product and into more internal things, leaving me as one of the few people working on it. Since there wasn't much development happening, I worked mostly on GUI and even less on compilation. Then, after a year at AMD, I got laid off. I haven't been able to find work in almost 8 months now.\n\nThere were a number of reasons for my layoff, I think. I was one of the only people on the team without a Master's degree. I've been having ADHD issues that caused my performance to drop for a month or two before the layoff. But more importantly, I don't think I had the skills to keep up with the trajectory of the team. Everyone was moving off of supporting models on hardware and onto optimization and other such stuff internal to AMD. And as I've gotten out into the field again, a field that's changed a lot since 2021, I find that I'm lacking basically everything I'd need to get another compiler job.\n\nI don't have a Master's, I don't have any optimization knowledge. My expertise is PyTorch, Torch-MLIR, and IREE. PyTorch knowledge is useful, but only insofar as it applies to building models. Torch-MLIR and IREE seem to just not be used by anyone but my former company, and now no one at all. Hell, AMD's even hiring for my old position. I've applied and been denied multiple times.\n\nI really like compilers, but if there's no future in this for me I'll switch to doing something else. Can anyone give me some advice on this? I've tried asking my old coworkers for career advice but none of them have responded, and I'm starting to get desperate.\n\n[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/cHA7eV9.jpeg) my resume.",

I was oblivious about IT taking over the world and didn't know anything about programming until I was 17. I studied Comp Sci in an average university in my hometown and passed with average grades. I took a software dev job in a small firm with an average pay.

Now I see people from all over the world doing amazing stuff.

I'm happy that I'm now exposed to rigorous math stuff which I skimmed through in undergrad, but still I feel lagging so far behind.\n\nTo people who aren't computer nerds but have a decent career while managing other interests, how did you make it? How do you not get disappointed with yourself when people who are much younger than you are faring far ahead in their career?

I haven’t really had a lot of research experience as in I did a couple posters during my undergraduate. Nothing much outside of that in terms of published works. I have previous professional experience in artificial intelligence and machine learning and thoroughly enjoy the topics, so I’m unsure if that niche would also be good to fill. \n\nObviously nobody can predict what life will look like in 20 years, but I was wondering if anyone had ever previously known anyone who did this or has had any tenured professors without a PhD. If not, did they have a masters? An MBA? Let me know! \n\nAnd I acknowledge that this post is a little messy and all over the place. My thoughts on this are admittedly not fully sharpened when it comes to this. \n",

Motivation, Mindset, Team Fit, and Technical Clarity are my primary focuses for it so far. \n\nI have been going over my resume, all sorts of behavioral things that are in line with the 4 topics I mentioned above, and the behavioral HR things but with more technical details.

I’m well versed in C/C++ and Python, and have done a few projects for fun in the past (game engines, emulators, some tensorflow stuff). Although people tell me I could land a job, I’m not as hopeful. Looking through entry-level job listings, the sheer number of possible  technologies / frameworks I’d need to know is so vast, and I have no idea where to begin. Should I focus my efforts on one niche area and spend the next year learning it super well, or should I dip my toes in as much as possible? \n\nIf anyone else went from pure math to a programming role I’d love to know what your path was like ",
