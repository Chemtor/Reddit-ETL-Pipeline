        "content": "Hey I'm doing one of these sankey charts to show visualize my job search this year. I have 5 YOE working at a startup and was looking for a bigger, more stable company focused on a mature product/platform. I tried applying to a bunch of places at the end of last year, but hiring had already slowed down. At the beginning of this year I found a bunch of applications to remote companies on LinkedIn that seemed interesting and applied. I knew it'd be a pretty big longshot to get interviews, yet I felt confident enough having some experience under my belt. I believe I started applying at the end of January and finally landed a role at the end of March.\n\nI definitely have been fortunate to not need to submit hundreds of applications here, and I don't really have any specific advice on how to get offers other than being likable and competent (even when doing leetcode-style questions). I guess my one piece of advice is to apply to companies that you feel have you build good conversational rapport with, people that seem nice, and genuinely make you interested. Also say no to 4 hour interviews, those suck and I always bomb them. Often the kind of people you meet in these gauntlets are up to luck too so don't beat yourself up about getting filtered.\n\nIf anyone has questions I'd be happy to try and answer, but honestly I'm just another data engineer who feels like they got lucky.

Income from support and extra features down the road if this is actually useful.\n\n---\n\nPerformance so far:\n\n- 1k+ stream queries/sec on an AWS t4g.nano instance (AWS price \\~$3/month)\n- 800k+ q/sec on an AWS c8g.large instance. That's \\~1000x cheaper than AWS Managed Flink for similar throughput.\n\n---\n\nNow the big question:\n\nDoes this solve a real problem for enough folks out there? (We're thinking logs, cybersecurity, algo-trading, gaming, telemetry).  \n\nWorth pursuing or just a niche rabbit hole?

I looked into GX Core and see the main source options there again appear to be Pandas or Spark dataframes (yes, I'm going to try DuckDB through SQLAlchemy).

        "author": "LinasData",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "The original data chaos actually started *before* spreadsheets were common. In the pre-ERP days, most business systems were siloed—HR, finance, sales, you name it—all running on their own. To report on anything meaningful, you had to extract data from each system, often manually. These extracts were pulled at different times, using different rules, and then stitched togethe. The result? Data quality issues. And to make matters worse, people were running these reports directly against transactional databases—systems that were supposed to be optimized for speed and reliability, not analytics. The reporting load bogged them down.\n\nThe problem was so painful for the businesses, so around the late 1980s, a few forward-thinking folks—most famously Bill Inmon—proposed a better way: a data warehouse.\n\nTo make matter even worse, in the late ’00s every department had its own spreadsheet empire. Finance had one version of “the truth,” Sales had another, and Marketing were inventing their own metrics. People would walk into meetings with totally different numbers for the same KPI.\n\nThe spreadsheet party had turned into a data chaos rave.

        "content": "Hello,\nI’m facing a philosophical question at work and I can’t find an answer that would put my brain at ease. \n\nBasically we work with Databricks and Pyspark for ingestion and transformation.\n\nWe have a new data provider that sends crypted and zipped files to an s3 bucket. There are a couple of thousands of files (2 years of historic).\n\nWe wanted to use dataloader from databricks. It’s basically a spark stream that scans folders, finds the files that you never ingested (it keeps track in a table) and reads the new files only and write them.\nThe problem is that dataloader doesn’t handle encrypted and zipped files (json files inside).\n\nWe can’t unzip files permanently. \n\nMy coworker proposed that we use the autoloader to find the files (that it can do) and in that spark stream use the for each batch method to apply a lambda that does:\n- get the file name (current row)\n-decrypt and unzip\n-hash the files (to avoid duplicates in case of failure)\n-open the unzipped file using spark\n-save in the final table using spark \n\nI argued that it’s not the right place to do all that and since it’s not the use case of autoloader it’s not a good practice, he argues that spark is distributed and that’s the only thing we care since it allows us to do what we need quickly even though it’s hard to debug (and we need to pass the s3 credentials to each executor using the lambda…)\n\nI proposed a homemade solution which isn’t the most optimal, but it seems better and easier to maintain which is:\n- use boto paginator to find files\n- decrypt and unzip each file \n- write then json in the team bucket/folder\n-create a monitoring table in which we save the file name, hash, status (ok/ko) and exceptions if there are any\n\nHe argues that this is not efficient since it’ll only use one single node cluster and not parallelised. \n\nI never encountered such use case before and I’m kind of stuck, I read a lot of literature but everything seems very generic. \n\nEdit: we only receive 2 to 3 files daily per data feed (150mo per file on average) but we have 2 years of historical data which amounts to around 1000 files. So we need 1 run for all the historic then a daily run. \nEvery feed ingested is a class instantiation (a job on a cluster with a config) so it doesn’t matter if we have 10 feeds. \n\nEdit2: 1000 files roughly summed to 130go after unzipping. Not sure of average zip/json file though. \n\nWhat do you people think of this? Any advices ?\nThank you ",

        "author": "SnooAdvice7613",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi folks. My company is trying to switch some batch jobs to streaming. The current method is that the data are streaming data through Kafka, then there's a Spark streaming job that consumes the data and appends them to a raw table (with schema defined, so not 100% raw). Then we have some scheduled batch jobs (also Spark) that read data from the raw table, transform the data, load them into destination tables, and show them in the dashboards. We use Databricks for storage (Unity catalog) and compute (Spark), but use something else for dashboards.\n\nNow we are trying to switch these scheduled batch jobs into streaming, since the incoming data are already streaming anyway, why not make use of it and turn our dashboards into realtime. It makes sense from business perspective too.\n\nHowever, we've been facing some difficulty in rewriting the transformation jobs from batch to streaming. Turns out, Spark streaming doesn't support some imporant operations in batch. Here are a few that I've found so far:\n\n1. Spark streaming doesn't support window function (e.g. : ROW\\_NUMBER() OVER (...)). Our batch transformations have a lot of these.\n2. Joining streaming dataframes is more complicated, as you have to deal with windows and watermarks (I guess this is important for dealing with unbounded data). So it breaks many joining logic in the batch jobs.\n3. Aggregations are also more complicated. For example you can't do this: raw\\_df -> get aggregated df from raw\\_df -> join aggregated\\_df with raw\\_df\n\nSo far I have been working around these limitations by using Foreachbatch and using intermediary tables (Databricks delta table). However, I'm starting to question this approach, as the pipelines get more complicated. Another method would be refactoring the entire transformation queries to conform both the business logic and streaming limitations, which is probably not feasible in our scenario.\n\nHave any of you encountered such scenario and how did you deal with it? Or maybe do you have some suggestions or ideas? Thanks in advance.",

Okay so now that I've given a bit of context of what I'm trying to do, let me tell you my problem.  \nThe client wants me to schedule this job to run every 15min or so for staging and most probably every hour for production. The data in the raw datalake is partitioned by date (for example: s3bucket/table\\_name/2025/04/10/file.parquet). Now that I have to run this job every 15 min or so I'm not sure how to keep track of the files that have been processed and which haven't. Currently my script finds the current time and modifies the read command to use just the folder for the current date. But still, this means that I'll be reading all the files in the folder (processed already or not) every time the job runs during the day.   \nI've looked around and found that using DynamoDB for keeping track of the files would be my best option but also found something related to Iceberg metadata files that could help me with this. I'm leaning towards the Iceberg option as I wanna make use of all its features but have too little information regarding this to implement. would absolutely appreciate it if someone could help me out with this.  \nHas anyone worked with Iceberg in this matter? and if the iceberg solution isn't usable, could someone help me out with how to implement the DynamoDB way.",

        "author": "No-Exam2934",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey, I think there are better use cases for event sourcing.  \n  \nEvent sourcing is an architecture where you capture every change in your system as an immutable event, rather than just storing the latest state. Instead of only knowing what your data looks like now, you keep a full history of how it got there. In a simple crud app that would mean that every deleted, updated, and created entry is stored in your event source, that way when you replay your events you can recreate the state that the application was in at any given time.\n\nMost developers see event sourcing as a kind of technical safety net: - Recovering from failures - Rebuilding corrupted read models - Auditability\n\nSurviving schema changes without too much pain\n\nAnd fair enough, replaying your event stream often feels like a stressful situation. Something broke, you need to fix it, and you’re crossing your fingers hoping everything rebuilds cleanly.\n\nWhat if replaying your event history wasn’t just for emergencies? What if it was a normal, everyday part of building your system?\n\nInstead of treating replay as a recovery mechanism, you treat it as a development tool — something you use to evolve your data models, improve your logic, and shape new views of your data over time. More excitingly, it means you can derive entirely new schemas from your event history whenever your needs change.\n\nYour database stops being the single source of truth and instead becomes what it was always meant to be: a fast, convenient cache for your data, not the place where all your logic and assumptions are locked in.\n\nWith a full event history, you’re free to experiment with new read models, adapt your data structures without fear, and shape your data exactly to fit new purposes — like enriching fields, backfilling values, or building dedicated models for AI consumption. Replay becomes not about fixing what broke, but about continuously improving what you’ve built.\n\nAnd this has big implications — especially when it comes to AI and MCP Servers.\n\nMost application databases aren’t built for natural language querying or AI-powered insights. Their schemas are designed for transactions, not for understanding. Data is spread across normalized tables, with relationships and assumptions baked deeply into the structure.\n\nBut when you treat your event history as the source of truth, you can replay your events into purpose-built read models, specifically structured for AI consumption.\n\nNeed flat, denormalized tables for efficient semantic search? Done. Want to create a user-centric view with pre-joined context for better prompts? Easy. You’re no longer limited by your application’s schema — you shape your data to fit exactly how your AI needs to consume it.\n\nAnd here’s where it gets really interesting: AI itself can help you explore your data history and discover what’s valuable.\n\nInstead of guessing which fields to include, you can use AI to interrogate your raw events, spot gaps, surface patterns, and guide you in designing smarter read models. It’s a feedback loop: your AI doesn’t just query your data — it helps you shape it.\n\nSo instead of forcing your AI to wrestle with your transactional tables, you give it clean, dedicated models optimized for discovery, reasoning, and insight.\n\nAnd the best part? You can keep iterating. As your AI use cases evolve, you simply adjust your flows and replay your events to reshape your models — no migrations, no backfills, no re-engineering.",

        "content": "Hi Folks,\n\nIn my current project, we are ingesting a wide variety of external public datasets. One common issue we’re facing is that the **country names in these datasets are not standardized**. For example, we may encounter entries like **\"Burma\" instead of \"Myanmar\"**, or **\"Islamic Republic of Iran\" instead of \"Iran\"**.\n\nMy initial approach was to extract all unique country name variations and map them to a list of standard country names using logic such as CASE WHEN conditions or basic string-matching techniques.\n\nHowever, my manager has suggested we leverage **AI/LLM-based models** to automate the mapping of these country names to a standardized list to handle new query points as well. \n\nI have a couple of concerns and would appreciate your thoughts:\n\n1. **Is using AI/LLMs a suitable approach for this problem?**\n2. **Can LLMs be fully reliable in these mappings, or is there a risk of incorrect matches?**\n3. I was considering implementing a **feedback pipeline** that highlights any newly encountered or unmapped country names during data ingestion so we can review and incorporate logic to handle them in the code over time. Would this be a better or complementary solution?\n4. Please suggest if there is some better approach.\n\nLooking forward to your insights!",

Would love to hear real-world experiences on what actually scales, especially for large dimensions (10M+ rows) - how do you balance the Spark vs Redshift work while keeping everything consistent?\n\nLast but not least I want to know how to ensure fact tables are properly pointing to dimension tables, do we fill the foreign key column in spark before loading to redshift? \n\nPS: if you have any learning resources with practical implementations and best practices in place please provide them, because I feel the majority of the info on the web is theoretical.   \nThank you in advance.",

I wanted to share my proposed architecture and get your insights.\n\n1. The core components are: **Kafka:** Serving as the central nervous system for ingesting a massive amount of data reliably.\n2. **Go Processor:** A consumer application written in Go, placed directly after Kafka, to perform initial, low-latency processing and filtering of the incoming data.\n3. **Intermediate Queue (Redis Streams/NATS JetStream):** To decouple the low-latency processing from the potentially slower analytics and to provide buffering for data that needs further analysis.\n4. **Analytics Consumer:** Responsible for the more intensive analytical tasks on the filtered data from the queue.\n5. **WebSockets:** For pushing the processed insights to a frontend in real-time.\n\nThe idea is to leverage Kafka's throughput capabilities while using Go for quick initial processing. The queue acts as a buffer and allows us to be selective about the data sent for deeper analytics. Finally, WebSockets provide the real-time link to the user.\n\nI built this keeping in mind these three principles\n\n* **Separation of Concerns:** Each component has a specific responsibility.\n* **Scalability:** Kafka handles ingestion, and individual consumers can be scaled independently.\n* **Resilience:** The queue helps decouple processing stages.\n\nHas anyone implemented a similar architecture? What were some of the challenges and lessons learned? Any recommendations for improvements or alternative approaches?\n\nLooking forward to your feedback!",

The output files are typically in a binary format. Instrument vendors usually don’t provide parsers or APIs, as they want to protect their proprietary technologies.\n3. In most cases, the instruments come with dedicated software for data analysis, and the results can be exported as XLSX or CSV files. However, since each user may perform the analysis differently and customize how the reports are exported, the output formats can vary significantly—even for the same instrument.\n4. Even if we can parse the raw or exported files, interpreting the data often requires domain knowledge from the lab scientists.\n\nGiven these constraints, is it even possible to build a reliable ELT/ETL pipeline?",

I will receive several parsed addresses from this candidate as Washington is vague. What is the best practice in such cases?

My tasks generally are like this\n\n1. put configurations so that the source dataset can ingest and preprocess into aws s3 in correct file format. I've noticed sometimes filepath names randomly change without warning which would cause configs to change so I would have to be cognizant of that. \n\n2. the s3 output is then put into a mapping tool (which in my experience is super slow and frequently annoying to use) we have to map source -> our schema\n\n3. once you update things in the mapping tool, it SHOULD export automatically to S3 and show in production environment after refresh, which is usually. However, keyword should. There are times where my data didn't show up and it turned out I have to 'manually export' a file to S3 without being made aware beforehand which files require manual export and which ones occur automatically through our pipeline\n\n4. I then usually have to develop a SQL view that combines data from various sources for different purposes\n\nThe issues I'm facing lately....\n\nA colleague left end of last year and I've noticed that my workload has dramatically changed. I've been given tasks that I can only assume were once hers from another colleague. The thing is the tasks I'm given:\n\n1. Have zero documentation. I have no clue what the task is meant to accomplish\n\n2. I have very vague understanding of the source data \n\n3. Just go off of an either previously completed script, which sometimes suffers from major issues (too many subqueries, thousands of lines of code). Try to realistically manage how/if to refactor vs. using same code and 'coming back to it later' if I have time constraints. After using similar code, randomly realize the requirements of old script changed b/c my data doesn't populate in which I have to ask my boss what the issue \n\n4. Me and my boss have to navigate various excel sheets and communication to play 'guess work' as to what the requirements are so we can get something out \n\n5. Review them with the colleague who assigned it to me who points out things are wrong OR randomly changes the requirements that causes me to make more changes and then expresses frustration 'this is unacceptable', 'this is getting delayed', 'I am getting frustrated' continuously that is making me uncomfortable in asking questions.\n\nI do not directly interact with the stakeholders. The colleague I just mentioned is the person who does and translates requirements back. I really, honestly have no clue what is going through the stakeholders mind or how they intend to use the product. All I frequently hear is that 'they are not happy', 'I am frustrated', 'this is too slow'. I am expected to get things out within few hours to 1-2 business days. This doesn't give me enough time to ensure if I made many mistakes in the process. I will take accountability that I have made some mistakes in this process by fixing things then not checking and ensuring things are as expected that caused further delays. Overall, I am under constant pressure to churn things out ASAP and I'm struggling to keep up and feel like many mistakes are a result of the pressure to do things fast.\n\nI have told my boss and colleague in detail (even wrote it up) that it would be helpful for me to: 1. just have 1-2 sentences as to what this project is trying to accomplish 2. better documentation.  People have agreed with me but they have not really done much b/c everybody is too busy to document since once one project is done, I'm pulled into the next. I personally am observing a technical debt problem here, but I am new to my job and new to data engineering (was previously in a different analytics role) so I am trying to figure out if this is a me issue and where I can take accountability or this speaks to broader issues with my team and I should consider another job.

        "author": "Comfortable_Onion318",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone, \n\nwe are a company that relies heavy on a so called no-code middleware that combines many different aspects of typical data engineering stuff into one big platform. However we have found ourselves (finally) in the situation that we need to migrate to a lets say more fundamental tech stack that relies more on knowledge about programming, databases and sql. I wanted to ask if someone has been in the same situation and what their experiences have been. Our only option right now is to migrate for business reasons and it will happen, the only question is what we are going to use and how we will use it. \n\n**Background:**  \nWe use this platform as our main \"engine\" or tool to map various business proccess. The platform includes creation and management of various kinds of \"connectors\" including Http, as2, mail, x400 and whatnot. You can then create profiles that can get fetch and transform data based on what comes in by one of the connectors and load the data directly into your database, create files or do whatever the business logic requires. The platform provides a comprehensive amount of logging and administration. In my honest opinion, that is quite a lot that this tool can offer. Does anyone know any kind of other tool that can do the same? I heard about Apache Airflow or Apache Nifi but only on the surface. \n\nThe same platform we are using right now has another software solution for building database entities on top of its own database structure to create \"input masks\" for users to create, change or read data and also apply business logic. We use this tool to provide whole platforms and even \"build\" basic websites. \n\nWhat would be the best tech stack to migrate to if your goal was to cover all of the above? I mean there probably is not an all in one solution but that is not what we are looking for right now. If you said to me that for example apache nifi in combination with python would be enough to cover everything our middleware provided would be more than enough for me.  \n  \nWhat is essential for us is also a good logging capability. We need to make sure that whatever data flows are happening or have happended is comprehensible in case of errors or questions. \n\nFor input masks and simple web platforms we are currently using C# Blazor and have multiple projects that are working very well, which we could also migrate to.

I'm excited to dive into **ADF** and try out some new things.\n\nHere, you can see we have a copy data activity that transfers files from the source ADLS to the raw ADLS location.

Now, I'm encountering an issue as I'm trying to introduce this archive delete flag concept.\n\nIf the **archive\\_delete\\_flag** is '**Y**', it should not delete the files from the source, but it should delete the files if the **archive\\_delete\\_flag** is '**N**', '' or NULL, depending on the Metastore values. How can I make this work?\n\nLooking forward to your suggestions, thanks!",

And they do not have high confidence in our current primary cloud provider's K8 cluster hosting experience.\n\nThe project I have right now is using cloud-native solutions for stateful stream processing without custom solutions for storing state, etc. Which I have warned is going to result in driving this project into the ground due to costs spent in prohibitively expensive cloud-provider-locked-in stream processing and batch processing solutions currently being used. Not to mention the terrible DX and poor test-ability of the currently used stateless stream processing solutions.\n\nThis whole idea of moving us to Apache Flink is starting to feel hopeless, so any advice would be much appreciated!",

You could technically do it with anyone or anything, but for me it’s been my now 3 month old daughter.\n\nSo, obviously children require a lot of attention, so she’s pretty much right by me anytime I’m not at work. She really enjoys just listening to me and her mother talk, and that gave me an idea to help keep her calm while I code. That idea was to just explain everything I’m working on as I do it to her. Building a database schema? I explain every step out loud to her. An API endpoint? Same thing. What I’ve realized in doing this is that I’m retaining information exponentially better than I was. There’s something about saying it all out loud, and pretending that I’m legitimately teaching her how to do what I’m working on, that has made learning and retaining information so much easier. \n\nSo the moral is talk out loud about what you’re doing. Explain it to your dog, your significant other (if they’re willing to listen), your cat, goldfish, child, or whatever/whoever you have that will listen. It’s been a game changer for me. ",

I built projects, contributed to open source, grind leetcode redid my resume more than 15 times networked attended meetups, and still… nothing. Not even an internship. Every rejection email felt worse than last and after so many, I just can’t take it anymore. I love programming. I love the logic, the creativity, the problemsolving. But love isn’t enough. If no one will give me a chance then maybe this just isn’t for me. Maybe I’m not smart enough, not good enough, or just not lucky enough. The tech world is brutal, and I don’t have the strength to keep getting back up. To this community thank you. this was the only place where I felt like I belonged. The encouragement the advice the shared struggles… it meant everything. But I have to walk away now. I can’t keep pouring my soul into something that only gives me depression in return lol.\n\nTo those still fighting: I hope you make it. I hope your hard work pays off in ways mine never did. As for me… I don’t know what’s next. But it’s time to let go.\n\nGoodbye, and thank you. <3\n\nEdit: Wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up. To everyone saying \"don’t give up\", I wish I had your strength. But right now, I’m just… tired. Maybe one day I’ll try again.  \nI’ve also seen some comments questioning my experience or how seriously I’ve taken this, so let me clarify: I’ve been learning and coding for *years*. But the last six months I treated this like a job.\n\nI wasn’t just casually building projects I was studying 6-7-8 hours a day (damn sometimes even 10 or 12), grinding, refining my GitHub, sending applications, and reaching out to recruiters. I didn’t expect a full-time role right away I was aiming for an internship but after hundreds of applications, coding tests, and even dozens of interviews that went nowhere… it’s clear something isn’t working. Maybe it’s my lack of a CS degree, maybe it’s the market, maybe it’s just me. But after this much effort with no results, it’s hard not to feel defeated. To those who made it: I’m happy for you. Truly. But not everyone’s journey ends the same way.\n\nWith that being said this post is in no way attempt of discouraging anyone, I'm just simply sharing my experience, nothing more, nothing less.",

        "author": "soumyadyuti_245",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey everyone,  \nSo I’m in my 2nd year of college and recently landed a backend engineering internship. It sounded super exciting at first—cool tech stack like WebRTC, Mediasoup, AWS, Docker, NGINX, etc. The internship is 4 months long, and we were told the first month would be for training. I was really looking forward to learning all this industry-level stuff.\n\nWell… that didn’t really happen the way I thought it would.\n\nThey gave us an AWS “training” on literally day two, but it was just a surface-level overview—stuff like “this is EC2, this is S3,” and then moved on. Then like 4 days in, they dropped us into the actual codebase of their project (which is like a Zoom/Google Meet alternative), gave us access to a bunch of repos, and basically said, “Figure it out.”\n\nI was still pumped at this point. I dove into the code, started learning the tools they’re using, and I even told them I’m still learning AWS but I’m 100% willing to put in the effort if someone can guide me a bit. I wasn’t expecting hand-holding, just *some* support.\n\nThen came this task: me and another intern were asked to deploy one of their websites on an AWS EC2 instance. Sounds simple, right? Yeah, it wasn’t. It involved changing environment variables, working with existing instances, setting up Docker containers, and doing a sort of “redeployment” on a live setup. And we weren’t even trained for any of this.\n\nIt’s been three days now, and we’ve been stuck. Trying to figure things out through tutorials, trial and error, asking questions. But the people assigning the task just keep saying “This is a simple task, you should be able to do this.” No real help, no troubleshooting, just passive-aggressive comments about how we’re not capable if we can’t get it done.\n\nThey say they want us to “learn by doing,” but at this point it doesn’t feel like learning—it feels like being set up to fail. Oh, and they also want us to document the entire experience, like a reflection on what we learned… but how am I supposed to reflect when I’m stuck the entire time and no one’s guiding us?\n\nWhat’s really messing with me is that this wasn’t even part of the actual project work. This was just some side task they threw at us. Meanwhile, my college work is piling up, my sleep schedule’s shot, and honestly, it’s getting hard to stay motivated when it feels like I’m not being given a fair chance to succeed.\n\nI’m not afraid of hard work. I *want* to learn. But this whole “sink or swim” approach with no support is just burning me out. And it makes me feel like if I fail at this one task, they’ll label me as someone who doesn’t know AWS—which isn’t even fair because I’m *literally* just starting out.\n\nSo yeah, I don’t know. Maybe I’m overthinking it. Maybe this is just how things are. But it’s starting to feel more like they care about the results than actually mentoring or helping us grow.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation? Is this normal? Or are they actually just mishandling the whole internship thing?",

After some research, Python seemed like a good place to start. I fell in love with it and I’ve been using it ever since for personal projects.\n\nOne thing I don’t get is the notion that some people have that Python is simple, to the point that I’ve heard people even say that it “isn’t real programming”. Listen, I’m not exactly over here worrying about what other people are thinking when I’m busy with my own stuff, but I have always taken an interest in psychology and I’m curious about this.\n\nIsn’t the goal of a lot of programming to be able to accomplish complex things more easily? If what I’m making has no requirement for being extremely fast, why should I choose to use C++ just because it’s “real programming”? Isn’t that sort of self defeating? A hatchet isn’t a REAL axe, but sometimes you only need a hatchet, and a real axe is overkill.\n\nShouldn’t we welcome something that allows us to more quickly get our ideas out into the screen? It isn’t like any sort of coding is truly uncomplicated; people who don’t know how to code look at what I make as though I’m a wizard. So it’s just this weird value on complication that’s only found among people that do the very most complicated types of coding.\n\nBut then also, the more I talk to the rockstar senior devs, the more I realize that they all have my view; the more they know, the more they value just using the best tool for the job, not the most complex one.",

They are used as a place for the users to address and discuss more about the question, since the answers have to be used more to directly answer the question.\n\nWhen you see a StackOverflow question, instead of simply going for the top-rated answer and closing the page, also take a look at the comments, people generally discuss more intrinsically about the proposed solution, like more why it works, the possible drawbacks, etc. The comments may even have a better solution for cases where, for example, the answer is out of date. These discussions generally lead to you having a better understanding of the technology, concepts, language or whatever it is you are looking for.\n\nAnd you can also make questions in the comments! IMO, the comments are the place for the \"simpler\" questions people generally say are pushed back in StackOverflow, as there is generally no pressure to make good and structured questions.\n\nAlso, a bit out of the topic here, but please also take a look at the answers other than the accepted or top-rated ones, they could bring solutions that are more up to date or fit better your scenario.\n\n\nTLDR: StackOverflow comments provides many insights about the questions and answers, being a great place to look for discussions and learn more about the resource, also for asking \"simpler\" questions (also look at answers other than the accepted or top-rated ones).",

I only know JS from being self-taught, and I told them that in the interview. I have been a DA for years, so I have made some great process improvements in that regard. Especially considering nobody understands data structure, SQL, or anything outside basic Excel.\n\nI immediately got thrown in and asked to redesign various pages, tie into APIs, etc. I just scratched the surface of arrow functions, so this was daunting. Still, I have been making progress and doing okay. I just feel like I have large gaps in my knowledge. There's no ticket system here, no tracking. The only gauge on progress is 1v1 meetings with my boss.\n\nMy boss and director don't understand JS. My team does not either. I'm seriously on my own and rely on research and my own grit to make it through. I haven't made any major mistakes, but that's only because I don't know if I have. There's nobody to bounce ideas off of or rely on if I'm on PTO. I don't understand the distinction between the test and prod environment at a deeper level. Sometimes I can update pages on prod through test, and sometimes I can't. There's so many out of date files and I have no clue what bloat we have, or any sort of vulnerabilities we may have in our code.\n\nWith all that being said: I love my job. I'm not complaining and am so very grateful that I have a position to apply things I know/learning. I'm learning a lot, I am still being encouraged, my team members have hearts of gold, but it's obvious I am the only one with technical experience here. However, if I moved to a more technical company, I think people would be able to see right through my gaps in knowledge. Just wondering if anyone has been in a similar boat?",

In that regard, I'm having trouble discerning if it's ethical to have the password be encrypted server-side (and saving all its hashing parameters in the server, given that in theory nobody but the admins should ever see the data) or have it hashed client-side, preventing the server to ever touch the sensitive data but rendering the data absolutely obscured even to the people moderating the servers. The idea is that the administrators of each server node get access to all the data regarding a user when the user gets suspended for infringing the TOS so that they may investigate the user's activity to sus out if they actually broke any rules. Issue is, with me and my friends this isn't an issue, but if I ever decide to expand or distribute it, I'm fearing my actions or lack thereof may end in an iffy legal conflict worse come to worst, I'm new to \\[ethics\\] in programming in general so I'm not as good deciding when and what is sensitive data or to what extent I'm crossing a line, so any insight is greatly appreciated here.",

When I landed this internship, I had zero technical knowledge and was just starting my degree. Getting into such a well-known company so early on felt like a huge win, and in a way, it was. It’s the kind of name that looks amazing on a resume. The salary is really good for an intern, especially considering my financial background, and if I’m lucky enough to stay as a full-time employee, it would make a huge difference in my life financially.\n\nBut the reality inside hasn’t been as exciting as it looked from the outside. From the beginning, I felt completely out of place. I made mistakes, of course,but no one really explained what I was doing wrong or how I could do better. My team has been very distant, and over time, I’ve started to feel like I’m being excluded. Nothing direct or obvious, but there are signs. I try to contribute, show interest, ask questions… but everything I do seems to go unnoticed. It’s like I’m invisible. It makes me feel like all my efforts to grow or connect just don’t matter.\n\nOn top of that, the pressure is intense. Despite being an intern, it often feels like we’re expected to deliver at the level of someone with years of experience. There’s little to no feedback or support, just the expectation to perform. And honestly? It’s draining. I get home with no motivation to study, no energy to try, and I’ve even caught myself wondering if I should just cheat on exams to get through. I hate that it’s come to this.\n\nLately, I’ve been thinking that maybe I should try working at a smaller company—somewhere with a slower pace, less pressure, and where I might actually be able to learn and breathe. But then I feel guilty for even thinking that. The money I make now matters. Staying at this company would open doors. And walking away kind of hurts my ego too—it feels like I’d be “downgrading,” like I couldn’t handle it. But at the same time… what’s the cost of staying? I already feel the early signs of burnout. I’m constantly stressed, anxious, and losing the passion I once had for this field. What if staying just ruins my mental health long-term?\n\nI don’t know. I want to give IT a fair chance because I’ve already changed areas once and I don’t want to give up again. But this whole experience has made me doubt myself and question if I really belong here.\n\nHas anyone else been through something similar? How did you navigate it?",

Currently a few weeks into a software engineering program and find myself going through so many emotions every day; however, what a fun task it is to create something.\n\nAs a career salesman and ops manager, I was never afforded the opportunity to create and was always just pushing others products. For the first time in my life, I am having to exercise a part of my brain to utilize creativity to not only build the model of what I want to create but also to problem solve as that is what great engineers do.\n\n  \nIt is fascinating to me to see how people are viewing AI as either a godsend or a hinderance to their progress.  I guess I see it from both sides and also realized that which one it was ultimately came down to how I used the technology. Whether we are talking about ChatGPT, Co-Pilot, cursor ide, etc. these AI's are doing exactly what we are asking it to do. \n\nIf you do not like the technology; are you giving it limitations like \"only provide me a hint or clue\" to the method or function that isn't working or do you let it return fixed code. I always give my queries very strict logic so I do not deprive myself from the experience of learning. This is just as true when working with mentors, we must make sure to set clear boundaries so our partners can encourage and get the best out of us without spoon-feeding us data. \n\nLook forward to participating and learning with you.

I've thought about switching to mechanical engineering since it seems like a broader field, but I'm worried it might not be in demand because of Al and automation. On the other hand, I also wonder if I should just stick with software engineering and pursue a master's in Al to future-proof my career, given how rapidly that field is growing. I guess I'm just torn between these two paths and unsure if software engineering is really the right fit for me long term.",

It happens when you live in Italy, and you are blocked outside of metropolitan zone, but well it is shit you don't really interested...   \n  \nDeveloping is a good choice, I know many languages, developing bases (you know, base algorithms, Object Oriented Paradigm, and all stuff), and IT fundamentals (IT networking, web, AI bases and so on).  \nSome past experience in some languages, but i never put myself into a correct routine to become able to produce something useful. \n\nIn the last months I've decided to invest some time to make a step over on my developing learning. Idea was to be able enough to make some MVPs for my startup projects. \n\nNow the question: I'm start with Ruby/Rails, for convenience: basic knowledge of language, monolith structure that is useful when you are building prototypes, some magic for a quick write and go.  \nBut Ruby is not an used language. If i look on Linkedin, there are near to zero opportunities for rubyists and less than zero network potentiality. I suppose that I will never find another developer in 200Km range around me, for some collaboration if I need. So I ask myself if I should invest to change perspective and go on other routes: javascript (gods, I Hate javascript), PHP ( feels old), Phyton (the swiss knife of programming, but the diffusion around me is not so different than Ruby), or.. well... or?\n\n",

Since I didn't go to school, and my self-taught journey didn't really touch on the fundamentals of computer science, I feel like I'm grossly underprepared and destined to fail. I feel like I know syntax well for the languages I use, and I understand at a basic level the technologies we use, such as docker, but I don't feel like I'm a good programmer. \n\nFor example, I don't know data-structures and algorithms at all. I've heard of Big O in passing and that's about it. I haven't really ever had to employ any design patterns, so I haven't learnt about them for the most part. \n\nI never had to grind leet code or anything like that. I put together a few simple React applications before this job and that's it. \n\nGranted, I've learnt things on the job, such as separating the UI layer from the business logic and data layer, but I just don't know what direction I should go to get better. \n\nShould I start learning the basic, fundamental stuff I kind of skipped? Should I start grinding leet code even though I already have a job?

        "content": "I would like to accomplish something but I'm not really sure how. Picture a function that takes an arbitrary 8 bit value. The function checks to see if the value is within a certain range, and returns a value based on the range the input value falls within:\n\n    int bucket_for_value(unsigned uint8_t x) {\n        if (x >= 0 && x < 32) return 0;\n        else if (x >= 32 && x < 64) return 1;\n        else if (x >= 64 && x < 96) return 2;\n        else if (x >= 96 && x < 128) return 3;\n        else if (x >= 128 && x < 160) return 4;\n        else if (x >= 160 && x < 192) return 5;\n        else if (x >= 192 && x < 224) return 6;\n        else if (x >= 224 && x < 256) return 7;\n        else return -1; // Out of range\n    }\n\nYou see, theoretically there's an equal chance for an arbitrary number to fall within any of these ranges.\n\nNow the challenging part. I want to be able to control the values within the parentheses using a single parameter (for the sake of illustration, imagine a physical knob), where the knob in the center evenly distributes the chance, as above. Then, turning it all the way to the left results in the first statement having a 100% chance in returning 0, like:\n\n    int bucket_for_value(unsigned uint8_t x) {\n        if (x >= 0 && x < 256) return 0;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 1;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 2;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 3;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 4;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 5;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 6;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 7;\n        else return -1; // Out of range\n    }\n\nAnd turning it all the way to the right results in a 100% chance of returning 7, like:\n\n    int bucket_for_value(unsigned uint8_t x) {\n        if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 0;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 1;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 2;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 3;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 4;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 5;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 6;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 256) return 7;\n        else return -1; // Out of range\n    }\n\nBut I want to also be able to have our hypothetical 'knob' to values between the center and extremes shown above, and have the value be 'weighted' accordingly. I have no idea how to implement this and though to ask here.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice. Appreciated. Thanks!",

        "content": "Lately, I’ve been hit with this frustrating cycle: I start my day with no clear plan, and somehow the hours just disappear as I jump from one task to the next. I often find myself starting a project—something that initially feels inspiring and full of potential—but as the day goes on, a new idea or distraction pulls me away, and that original project is left hanging.\n\nIt’s an all-too-familiar scenario for me. I’m constantly toggling between tasks and ideas, chasing that excitement of a new challenge, only to end up with a pile of half-finished work. It’s like I’m trying to capture lightning in a bottle, but it keeps slipping through my fingers. I know many of us have been there, feeling like our days are too scattered to truly make progress.\n\nFor context, I’m a computer science student, and I love dabbling in various projects here and there—whether it’s coding something fun, exploring a new tech concept, or just experimenting with fresh ideas. But this love for starting new projects is also why I struggle so much with focusing on just one thing and seeing it through.\n\nHave any of you experienced this same problem? How do you cope with it, and what strategies have helped you find some balance between creativity and productivity? I’d really appreciate hearing your insights or any tips that have worked for you. Also are there any AI apps maybe that solve this problem ?",

I want to build myself/outsource a website solution that is:  \n  \n1) Simple layout/navigation with different question types randomly chosen (at least multiple choice and short answer; maybe sorting or matching too)  \nJust like FreeCodeCamp's quiz site [https://developerquiz.org/](https://developerquiz.org/) which I really like the layout and simplicity of.\n\n  \n2) Shows the correct solution as text or an embedded video (externally hosted) solution. Just like the DeveloperQuiz pop-up after an answer submission.\n\n  \n3) User registration to save attempts/progress and the total points gained as they practice different topics.\n\n  \n4) Some sort of simple gamification. A basic points system for answering questions correctly. An overall leaderboard based on said points. Topic-based leaderboards.\n\n5) A manageable way for me to add questions. I also don't want people to be able to \"easily\" steal my question database. Is php and mysql the way to go? I've tried looking for Youtube tutorials.\n\nCan anybody point me in the right direction? Please bear with me. I'm a teacher and not a web-developer though I am willing to learn anything that is necessary. Thank you!",

I’m not trying to master every advanced concept right now—instead, I want to focus on intermediate-level DSA that's essential for interviews.\n\nIn my country, most interviewers don’t go too deep into DSA. They usually focus more on development skills, but DSA is still important as it’s often the first step of the interview process. That’s why I want to build a solid foundation—strong enough to clear this stage. I’m also looking to improve my understanding of OOP, core computer science concepts, and how they relate to problem-solving.\n\nWhat I really need is a one-stop structured resource that covers all key DSA topics in a proper order. Once I go through that, I don’t want to keep jumping between different tutorials (except for platforms like LeetCode or wherever we solve problems).\n\nAlthough I do have Coursera Plus right now, it will expire on June 20th, and I’m currently not in a position to pay for any other course/platform after that. So I would prefer a resource that’s completely free or at least accessible during this time.\n\nI have about 3 months of summer vacation coming up, with 10–12 hours per day available for DSA. So I’d really like to make the most of this time before university starts again.\n\nWould love any suggestions you have. Thanks in advance!\n\nTL;DR:\nI'm looking for a free, structured DSA resource in Python that covers everything in order—so I don’t have to rely on multiple sources (except problem-solving platforms like LeetCode).

I’ll have 10–12 free hours daily for the next 3 months, so I want to make the most of it before university resumes.\nNeed something that includes OOP + core CS concepts too.

Senior folks gatekeeping knowledge, no clear training, just figuring things out on my own through trial, error, and stress. It took way longer than it should’ve and left me constantly feeling like I was behind.\n\nThen I climbed the ladder. On paper, that sounds like a win,,, but every role I left was on the verge of collapsing. I’d move up, get more money, but also inherit more chaos. Now I make decent money, but it comes with a nonstop stream of incidents, rollbacks, escalations, and worst of all: on-call. There’s no break. No peace. I’m always on edge, waiting for the next fire.\n\nMeanwhile, my friends outside of tech? They seem so much lighter. Sure, they’ve got problems like everyone else,,, but they’re not mentally trapped in their jobs 24/7. Me? This job has consumed my life. Even when I’m off, I’m not really off. I’m checking alerts, dreading pings, and thinking about what might break next.\n\nAnd to make things worse, every company wants people with 10+ years of experience, and offshore teams are replacing roles left and right. It’s harder than ever to pivot or even find a quieter tech job.\n\nHonestly? I’m at the point where I just want a normal job. One where I show up, do what I’m supposed to do, and then go live my damn life.\n\nBtw I worked have real jobs before i don’t understand why folks just quick to assume it’s just been tech. I worked construction for years so I know what it’s like I’m just saying I wish I had a role to mentally clock out of like normal roles. \n\n\nSorry for the rant but damn I’m just burnt out.

I basically developed a crm for a small insurance agency and I learnt a lot over my time there. Obviously since I was inexperienced at the time some of the features may have small bugs. I was paid 15 an hour for the role and now have found a new role that pays 30 an hour and now since I have left my old boss is texting me about how to fix bugs and such and generally texting me everyday. How should I handle this situation? ",

The vast majority of ppl who have an internship lined up have probably had it secured for a while now and the closer we approach the summer, the harder it is for ppl without an internship to land one. \n\nAnyway here's where I enter. Im a Junior cs major at a t50 school, with an average/slightly below average gpa, and no past internship experience apart from personal projects on my resume(nothing to write home about). I started seriously applying on jan 1st applying to maybe 5-10 places as daily as I could. a variety of roles too (frontend,backend, fullstack, ML, and data science) for the most part id get ghosted, receive an automated follow up email 3 weeks later saying they went with another candidate, or if I was lucky get a aysnchronous hackerank coding assessment in which id get ghosted after. I try tweaking my resume a bit, test out different formats and even fluffing up a bit of my projects in an attempt to get any response. Obviously this is a common experience for many ppl here but I keep at it all the way from then till now with maybe only getting 3 actual 1:1 interviews. At this point summer Is approaching and I have no idea what I can really do on my end. \n\nI hear on reddit,tiktok and pretty much everywhere that one of the best ways to get your foot in the door is through a referral however, I had none. I tried reaching out to recruiters, but I barely got a response this late in the cycle. Anyway I happen to stumble on one of my childhood friends linkdin page and see that he got a recommendation from the chief officer of the company he intered at the summer before so I hit him up and ask him about it. He encourages me to send him an email. So I find his company email and send him a connect request pretty much stating that I was a good friend of the person he gave the recommendation to and asking if their company was still accepting interns attaching my resume and if we could schedule a time to call. Within 2 days he replies saying that \"any friend of (friends-name) is a friend of mine\", that I had a solid mix of skills on my resume, and that he was going to check if there are any project/internship openings for me to do. Fast forward to the call, I did some quick prep on reviewing my resume and the company. He was a super nice guy, asked me some questions about my resume, what the job entails, and just overall a chill conversation abt who I was and my skills. i didn't have to do any leetcode style technical interview and I essentially bypassed the whole \"traditional process in a sense\". So yeah I knew connections were important within the work force and adult life but holy shit this was one of those eye opener moments cause I didn't realize how powerful it could be.\n\nTLDR: average cs student struggles to land an internship let alone even hear back from companies but uses an unrealized connection to bypass the \"traditional\" interview process and land the job",

        "author": "Neurprise",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I recently joined this startup near the middle/end of February for a new backend team they were building for a new product. At the same time as me joined a manager, older guy who's worked in startups for 20 years, as well as a coworker who worked at a big tech company.\n\nAfter two \"failed\" sprints, I had a 1:1 yesterday, as we usually do weekly on Fridays, and he basically told me that he had performance concerns about me and that I need to improve for the next sprint or two or \"things will get messy (implying termination).\" Soon after the conversation, he and HR send me a letter I had to sign essentially saying what he said in the call. Some details on the situation:\n\n- He said that in all his 20 years of working for startups, not once has he failed a sprint (and he defined failing one as not having any tickets roll over to the next sprint), yet since we started, he has failed every single one (when we first started, there was one ticket that blocked us and it rolled over, and he considered that a failure and wrote a big email about how he's sorry he failed). \n\n- Manager comes from a culture that emphasizes working long hours. Now I come from the same culture (I'm sure you can guess what it is) but I was born here instead so I don't have the same sort of expectations as he does.\n\n- Coworker is an overachiever who has spent considerable time at a big tech and brought a super convoluted [microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ) architecture that is very difficult to grasp. The way it's set up, you essentially can't even fully run it locally as it uses dev containers and there's some issue with the ports overlapping when you try to work on multiple services at once, and you also essentially need one IDE window open for each service as they're all in different repos of course. He has so many PRs, it's even hard to follow for me to be productive, so, to be fair, I'm not as productive as I could be, but it's more me not being able to deal with this overcomplicated codebase. Since joining only 1.5 months ago, there was essentially no ramp up period for me to learn the new codebase and architecture that the overachieving coworker built in a week.\n\n- Together they essentially work at all hours of the day, most recently they were working at 10 pm working on some issue and I saw the Slack conversation only once I opened my laptop the next day. The manager during one of the standup calls said he was up around 5 or 6 am from the night before trying to debug some build issue.\n\n- I was dealing with a longer running illness and took 2 sick days a few weeks ago and then 2 earlier this week. The coworker took over my tickets that I had in progress and just finished them himself.\n\n- Manager said they are dealing with deadlines imposed on them from above, wanting to get a full backend and frontend MVP out by the end of next month, so it seems some of this stuff is him trying to deflect issues onto performance concerns on me, but funnily enough we have a separate frontend team and they seem a lot more chill, they essentially haven't done much as the designs themselves have not been finalized.\n\nThe multi-page letter itself essentially mentioned some of these points and implied that I didn't work on enough tickets last sprint and none this sprint (due to coworker finishing them) and said that while they understood I had an illness, I essentially should have completed them by the end of the sprint anyway. The letter literally had a *day-by-day* account of every day of the sprints that I had failed to finish a ticket and that I should have communicated what I was doing that day. Never in my professional life had I seen such minute detail and I honestly don't know how the manager spent so much of their own time to draft this up. At the end of this section, he essentially implied that I lied about what I was doing every day and it said \"dishonesty is not tolerated at this company.\"\n\nI brought up all of these sorts of concerns (overachieving coworker, hard to grasp codebase, illness) multiple times to my manager previously in 1:1s and he kinda acted like he sympathized but essentially said tough shit you gotta finish your work (like he acted nice in the video call and said it diplomatically but then on the letter it was harshly worded).\n\nAt the end, the manager said that I should think about all this over the weekend and give it a \"fresh start\" on Monday, implying improving massively over the next few weeks. Is this essentially a PIP? Should I actually try working on this or start looking for new roles? Problem is this role pays quite well, at least 15% higher than other roles I've been seeing in the market so wondering if that's worth it or not (or maybe they'll just fire me anyway after a month).",

So far, I’ve received offers from Apple, Meta, and Amazon, and the total compensation packages are looking great. Here’s a breakdown of each:\n\n# Apple: Senior software engineer\n\nLocation: Cupertino\n\nApple was my top choice at first. Not the highest Comp but there was definitely room for negotiation.\n\n* **Base Salary:** $300,000\n* **RSU:** $132,000 per year for the next 4 years\n* **Bonus:** $21,000\n* **Total Comp:** $453,000\n\n# Meta: Senior software engineer\n\nLocation: San Francisco\n\nMeta made an offer that I didn’t expect to be as good as it was.\n\n* **Base Salary:** $170,000\n* **RSU:** $275,000 per year for the next 4 years\n* **Bonus:** $50,000\n* **Total Comp:** $495,000\n\nThey offered a larger stock grant and increased the bonus to compete with Apple’s offer.\n\n# Amazon:\n\nLocation: Santa Monica\n\nAmazon was very aggressive in getting me to sign quickly. The only thing that is holding me back is their toxic culture. Their stock options were a huge part of the offer.\n\n* **Base Salary:** $250,000\n* **RSU:** $272,000 per year for the next 4 years\n* **Bonus:** $10,000\n* **Total Comp:** $532,000\n\nNow, I need to make a decision soon. The numbers are all great, but I’m wondering if there’s a resource, or a negotiation framework, that can help me maximize my offer in the next few weeks. Does anyone have tips, tools, or services that have helped them land even bigger offers or negotiate more effectively? I need to get this right, and I’m feeling the pressure with such a tight deadline.\n\nHas anyone used levels.fyi's negotiation service? It's really expensive so I'm wondering if there are any alternatives out there.\n\nEDIT: my friend recommended me to try [SalaryScript](http://salaryscript.com). Apple and Amazon gave me around $40k to $66k additional TC but I got $83k more with the Meta offer so I accepted that one. Thanks all for the suggestions",

They said:\n\n>\n\n**Bad news?** I didn’t get the job.  \n**Good news?** I made such a strong impression that the manager wanted to bring me on anyway—**in a completely new position that didn’t exist.**\n\nThey literally created a new **role**, adjacent to the original one I applied for, just to bring me in. No public posting, no backup list. Just a straight-up “let’s figure out how to make this work.”\n\n# Here’s why I’m sharing this:\n\nSometimes not getting the job doesn’t mean you failed.  \nIt means that role wasn’t built for you—but that doesn’t mean *you* didn’t make an impact.\n\nIf you show up clear, focused, and ready? The right manager will notice. And sometimes, they’ll do more than just say “we’ll keep in touch.”  \nThey’ll build the door you were supposed to walk through.\n\nI know this occurrence is rare but things can happen, people can open doors for you. Im proof it can and i'll even add something else, im not super special or anything like that. I just conveyed my experience the best way i could during the interview and tied past experiences to what they were looking for and got lucky for sure. Keep applying guys dont give up!",

        "author": "wbcm",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I used to be active on SO around 10 years ago and it was generally great, mostly helpful and insightful but only a little rough around the edges. Fast forward to the last month and I started being active there again and... using it over the last month has been a dumpster fire. It really feels like the point of the site has gone from providing answers/solutions to being more of a game of clout and academic trivialities. After really reviewing the current rules of the site and the culture that has formed on it, it seems like SO is trying to extinct itself. There are two big problems I see.\n\n\n1: The culture is designed and empowered to be horrible\nComing back to answering questions after so many years I was really surprised to see the same one or two dozen people across nearly everything I was answering. The small group of power users or moderators have an uncanny ability to be posting or editing things on there all day. They also seem to be the ones who are more eager to downvote answers or close questions with little regard for the community, or even following the conversations. The way the points system works basically means that you cannot interact with anything in the community until amassing a lot of points, which is normally gate-kept by these power users. Other people can also upvote your posts, but in order to get the ability to upvote it seems like newer users have to endure a lot of bullying to get there, if they get there at all. If you are new and get a couple downvotes on your posts you are not allowed to post anything again until your existing posts get more upvotes, but there is no robust way for that to organically happen in most of the site that only sees under a 100 views per question. This has created a weird vacuum where the power users kind of have the ability to knight newer users or essentially permanently disable newer user's accounts. On top of this, the culture seems to really prize putting people (and their questions and answers) down. The first couple of times someone would leave a single sentence comment on my answer basically saying \"you're wrong\", I was more eager to engage with it to see what I was missing. Over time the majority of such engagements turned out to be someone who would continue to say \"you're wrong\" but not want to elaborate, or missing understanding on the question/answer that was relevant. Over time, I realized that this was just the culture that is there. Unsurprisingly, I have began to recognize certain power users usernames and saw them bullying newer people in the questions and answers. This is alienating a huge group of people who are either new to programming and SO, or are experienced programmers that are new to SO. AKA, not many new people want to stay on the site. This massively reflects in the lowering number of questions coming in and the speed in which they are answered. This is only worsened by the expanding prevalence of LLMs. It is hard to see the next generation of programmers preferring the high likelihood of waiting a long time to be bullied on SO, vs an LLM who can instantly offer any type of information for your question and will not be toxic. \n\n\n2: [duplicate] \nIt is good to not let a question get asked for the millionth time in a row, but I saw so many questions that were immediately closed as duplicates and the provided duplicates were either many years out of date or only partially related. At a certain point all the programming questions that people can ask, will have been asked... unless new programming languages or software versions allow for substantively new questions to be asked. There was no good globally centralized place to ask programming questions before SO, and so there was at least 30 years of programming questions that needed to be satiated. As time goes on, more and more questions will either legitimately be duplicates or, more likely, a mod is gonna mark it as duplicate since one part of the question overlaps with one part of another that was asked since the inception of SO. At this point, SO reads more like an encyclopedia than a lively place of discourse. Take somewhere like reddit, quora, or even the comment section of a youtube video where you are learning something, these all feel like they are much more engaging and are great places to connect and ask questions. SO on the other had feels like a good place to get your question turned away. Talking to some newer programmers I know, they have a shared sentiment that SO is a bad place to ask questions and prefer reddit and LLMs instead. There seemed to be a shared experience between all of them that any time they google a question that SO is often towards the top, which exposed them to it often, but when they made accounts and started trying to be active there they were met with bad experiences. This kind of reinforces the feeling like SO is heading towards being an encyclopedia/ghost town rather than a community. \n\n\nIn any case, these are just my loose thoughts around being active on SO after having not been after almost a decade. I used to remember it as being a great place and have just generally been surprised about how dumb and toxic it feels to be on there now. Do other people feel this way? Or did I somehow just jump back into the wrong parts of it?",

        "title": "The hierarchy of employment and how AI affects your job",
        "author": "The-_Captain",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**tldr;** my 2¢ on how to think about AI with respect to job security - own projects, not tasks\n\n**Background:** I'm a senior software engineer with 7 years of experience, including fintech, big tech, and early-stage startups. I'm currently bootstrapping a lifestyle-sized small software product for SMBs. \n\n**Point of this post:** I'm giving my two cents about how to think of your career in software and whether it is at risk from AI.\n\n**Part 1: the hierarchy of employment**\n\nI think of all jobs, including in software, as falling into three categories:\n\n1. Task-oriented: your day-to-day revolves around completing tasks assigned to you. If you're working at a cafe, that might mean \"clean the tables\" or \"make coffee.\" If you're a SWE, that might mean \"change the button color palette from blues to purples according to the design system.\" Being good at this means you're known for clearing Jira queues quickly and nobody has to clean up after you or redo work you said you did.\n2. Project-oriented: you're given projects to complete but the details and methods are up to you. If you're working at a cafe, it could be \"make sure the pastries are refreshed every two hours.\" If you're a software engineer, it could be \"implement the new design system.\" Being good at this means you can be trusted to deliver a feature that may have multiple ways of completing it while balancing trade-offs, on time. This often requires delegation. I'm at this level right now.\n3. Outcome-oriented: you own an outcome. That's often quantified in terms of money or a money-adjacent metric. If you're at a cafe, it can be increasing the number of baked goods sold with coffee orders. If you're in software (you may not be actively coding at this level), it may be \"increase conversions from large enterprise clients on the landing page.\" Being good at this means being known as someone who can make products grow revenue and/or profit. I'm upgrading to this level by bootstrapping a business - even if I fail, I will have owned an outcome.\n\nIn both coffee and software examples, notice that these are different roles on the same project. Notice also that I focus on \"being known as,\" which is the most important thing in career stability and progression.\n\nAlmost everyone typically starts on level 1. It's unusual and incredibly risky to stay at level 1, and you have to be constantly adapting and learning new technologies to pull it off. You want to graduate to level 2 as soon as possible**,** ideally within 2 years. Few people make it to level 3, it's normally OK to stay at level 2. Level 2 makes more than level 1 within the same company/skillset (of course a PM at Walmart might make less than an AI engineer at OpenAI). Level 3 has unbounded pay. \n\n**How to move levels**\n\nI am by no means a great authority on getting promoted, I tend to get distracted and chase my own goals. But from talking to people who are good at it, there are two things you need to do:\n\n1. Be really good at your current job band: if you're level 1, your manager knows that when they give you a task, it will be done when you say it will be done, it will be done to the highest reasonable standards, and nobody is going to have to clean up after you.\n2. Know your manager's goals and align your work to them. Find ways to make them look better and achieve their goals. Show you care.\n\nOf course, there are more cynical factors, like being liked and having a good attitude. Finally, your self-conception is important. If you think of yourself as \"a guy who makes Spring Boot apps\" you'll be stuck in level 1 longer than if you think of yourself as \"a guy who delivers backend services.\" PG has a great essay about keeping your self-characterization loose but I can't find it right now.\n\n  \n**Part 2: What AI means for you**\n\nAI is decently good at doing a lot of level 1 work. If you counted on being the gatekeeper of button colors as the reason for why you can't be fired, that's not going to work anymore. In fact, if you counted on being the gatekeeper of anything, that's unlikely to keep working. \n\nThat being said, level 1 is always risky. If you were a really good JQuery developer who could complete any task in that language, the rise of frameworks like React threatened your job. Not right away as your company might need you for their existing code, but the reduced demand for JQuery devs would lessen your bargaining power and the increased support and flood of React developers would make switching stacks increasingly attractive to your employer. Any major technology shift is a threat to level 1 operators.\n\nThe difference with AI, however, is that it's happening across all technologies at once. The goal is what's being automated, not just the method. AI can write basic software in any language. You can't switch from owning button colors in JQuery to owning button colors in React or whatever the next tech is, you have to upgrade what you can deliver.\n\nThere are tasks that AI can't do because it's not smart enough. If you're a staff engineer working on very complex problems you might be fine, but if you're part of the 90% that do various versions of the same thing that everyone else does, your job is at risk once the Devins of the world nail their product and user experience.\n\nThe good news is that it's also a resource that you can use:\n\n1. If you're currently task-oriented, use AI to be really good at completing tasks fast and well. Do this by focusing on the \"well.\" AI is already really fast compared to you, so don't try to go faster. Plan first, think what kind of testing you need, both automated and manual, and what the deployment story will look like\n2. Now that you know the hierarchy of employment, focus on graduating to the next band by understanding the context in which you're given tasks, talking to your lead, and making their project happen faster and better\n\n**Why AI is not a threat to bands 2 and 3**\n\nOwning a project requires taste. AI doesn't have taste yet, and I doubt it will develop it. The main difference between owning tasks and owning a project is thinking through tradeoffs, understanding how this project fits and what its goals are, and making a plan that aligns the tradeoffs with the goals. AI can be very helpful as an assistant in doing this, but it requires the person doing it to already know what the options are and what the goals are. This is not the case for basic feature development.\n\nLevel 3 is safe first because it's the decision makers who aren't going to fire themselves, and second because it requires even more intuition and experience than AI has access to. More importantly, it requires accountability, which is one of the main barriers to using AI.",

It also suffered its biggest one-day selloff since its record 27.5% plunge on June 16, 1998.\n\n>**Chief Executive Jonas Prising said the first quarter was a tale of two halves, as it began with \"a sense of optimism\" regarding economic growth in the U.S.**\n\n>**\"But the last several weeks have impacted the sense of confidence, and the mood is significantly more uncertain and cautious as a result of recent trade-policy announcements in the U.S., with ripple effects far beyond,\" Prising said, according to an AlphaSense transcript of the post-earnings call with analysts. \"At this stage, most of our clients are adopting a wait-and-see approach.\"**\n\n>**Another reason for reduced hiring has been a structural change in demand, primarily in the technology sector, due to the growth in AI. Prising said companies are now focusing more on skills development for their employees, to prepare them to work alongside AI.**\n\n>**Basically, companies would rather up-skill existing employees than hire new ones. This has particularly affected the market for software jobs.**\n\n>**\"So software coding and programming, you can really see how AI has made that much more efficient,\" Prising said. \"And you can see it also come through in the unemployment rate for software programmers here in the U.S., which is above 7% right now, and we're at 4.2% unemployment for the country.\"**\n\n>[https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250417516/job-hiring-has-slowed-and-software-sector-unemployment-is-high-this-headhunter-says](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250417516/job-hiring-has-slowed-and-software-sector-unemployment-is-high-this-headhunter-says)",

If setup is required describe it: if they ask you to develop in Python, make sure to package it using Poetry/Uv or whatever you want but simply shipping the function is not acceptable\n   * Write clear code, respect conventions, take care of the architecture, think about the user\n   * Be consistent in all aspects: in documentation, and in coding. Example: Don't separate somes lines by a ',', some others by a '.' and others by nothing. Chose one and stick to it\n   * Document your code: do not comment it, code should be self explanatory, if its not rework it, write actual Doxygen/XML documentation or whatever is the standard for the targeted langage\n   * Provide a unit test suite\n   * If you have time, showcase your project by integrating it into Github CI or Equivalent\n   * OA are an occasion to showcase your work practices and general knowledge, the problem itself is irrelevant, don't focus on it too much\n* SD interview:  had my first and only SD interview and passed. Your design is not important at all, providing you are not proposing absurd solutions. Focus on:\n   * Communicating. Explore all possibilities, even the obviously dumb ones, but CRITICIZE them. What's expected from an engineer is not someone who has an answer to everything but someone who can think, is creative, and is then capable of weeding out their ideas\n   * Always clarify functional and non-functional requirements. You are in control, make sure to select a sub-set of functional requirements that works good for you and is easy to design. Mention the more complex requirements and just state you won't take them into account. For instance, if they ask you do design a messaging app, focus on 1:1 conversations, emojis, read recipes and files exchange. You may want to discuss group messaging to show-off. Don't. Mention it, don't design it\n   * QPS values are not important. Once again it's all about thought process. The number themselves are irrelevant. Make sure to target realistic order of magnitude. You do not design YT for 10 users, but maybe assuming 10M a day is enough even though we all know the real number are hundred of times higher\n   * Ask for closed-feedback regularly. Once again an engineer is not someone who has all answer by themselves but someone who can communicate, listen to others, and find team approved solutions\n   * Keep things simple\n* Technical questions:\n   * It is ok you do not know. Do NOT invent an answer and assert it like its true. Simply states: \"Well I do not know that, but I guess we COULD do something like this, what do you think about it ? How would you approach this\"\n   * You should never have absolute answer to anything, unless its an academic question. The objective of those questions is to understand how you think and how you are going to interact with the team. You are already in a team, you + the interviewers form a work team. Keep it in mind.\n   * An interview is a discussion, not an exam, even if its on the question/answer format\n* Behavioral:\n   * Do not invent/memorize dumb stories, be them generated by ChatGPT or else.\n   * Those questions are to understand how you behave on a human an in a team, your answer should be clearly constructed, show the value of your work, and how you make impact/drive a team direction\n   * Don't trust the examples shown on Rainforest LP/STAR video, this is pure BS. **No one ever** walked into a project that was in shambles, sit and drafted a plan, and magically the plan solved all the roadblocks and the company earned 200M$ just thanks to this man \\\\o/. This is pure BS and as an interviewer someone who answers to me in this way will not pass to the next round.\n   * Always place value in the team. There's no self made man, when you were \"faced with a challenge\" it's not just you but the entire team. While you had individual actions that are important to highlight during those questions, as an interviewer this is when we see if someone appropriates the success or if they understand the value the entire team brought. You probably had project you lead alone, use them in those rounds, but always give credit to the team in other example, use that to illustrate how you can drive team decisions\n   * It is OK to take examples where you failed. Failing is part of the game. Use that to show how you reflect, what you learned, and what you are now doing differently\n   * Be yourself, aka **do not invent stories**, there's no point in not being a good cultural fit, it will only lead to regret on your end: I was once told in an interview they already had someone internally but that person was too introvert for the role they were interviewing me, and that my first decision would probably be to fire or not this person. I answered to them that my values are more about finding the strengths of a person and empowering them, rather than trying to have them fit in boxes they don't want to belong to. That person was a good employee who simply wanted to be directed in their work instead of leading change by themselves. They did not pass me to the next round and that was the right decision for all of us.\n\nI know that some companies are trying to transform the interview process in a theatrics show, but it's not what it is about. It's about connecting and showing that you can interact with multiple people on multiple teams, reflect on your ideas, and understand the ones coming from others.",

It just clicks for me.\n\nBut here’s the thing, most of the people around me are into web dev, and a few are doing cloud or cybersecurity. Every time someone asks what I’m working on and I say “embedded systems,” I get confused looks. Some even straight up ask, “Why aren’t you doing web dev? That’s where all the jobs are.” One senior even told me that 90% of tech jobs are in web development and I should probably consider switching if I care about a good career.\n  \nI like what I’m doing, but after listening to people around me, I am kind of confused, and I have few concerns:\n- Am I making a mistake by sticking to embedded systems?  \n- Is it really that much riskier than something like web dev?  \n- Should I just play it safe and go with the crowd, or keep following what I genuinely enjoy?\n\nWould love to hear from people who’ve walked either path.

While I was able to make it work the first time, my code made some violations to the architecture. That's fine and it was my mistake, but my boss (who's also the owner of the startup) was beyond mean in his review on my PR, asking me if I even read the code and very harsh stuff, which I really found unnecessary since it was my first time working with that app. From that point I just felt pressured to stop feeling like I was embarrassing myself as opposed to trying to deeply learn the app, so I made a couple more of fixes and again, same feedback, which wasn't constructive at all. The closest thing to constructive criticism I received was when he told me to look at how one of the files did the job, which I wonder, why not do that from the beginning? \n\nAt the end he said he didn't want to continue as my work was _completely unacceptable_, and what's funny about that is that he made a comment in my very first PR about a technique I used and he labeled it as _something you should never be doing in the industry_, and yet, I actually had taken that logic from the already existing code that he himself had either written or reviewed before, since it was on the master branch.\n\nI guess the question is, do all startups expect you to get everything right from the start and basically offer no mentorship, even when the job description listed 2 years of experience?

What's worse is that I don't feel the sparkle to reboot and shine again at my current job. I've been trying hard for the past years to find solutions to problems and to lead solutions towards results, but the red-tape and the politics won.

I go surfing in the afternoons, have sleep overs with my girlfriend and work together the next day, can take trips whenever I want, have moved temporarily to a bunch of different cities etc.\n\nFor the last year or so i've craved a new role, challenge and life experience because frankly being alone most of my week and not having stimulating work has gotten to me. I wanted to move away from SWE and go into a PM role. Well lucky me, I finally got everything I was asking for but now i'm unsure. The new role is hybrid(3days) in Los Angeles and base/tc is $145k/$180-200k. The TC includes options that vest over 6 years with a cliff at 3 so realistically I will be locked in for three years if I took the offer. I will obviously be working more hours than I am used too and i'd have to move away from my gf, friends and beach. I currently live in a beach town in OC where I can surf in 5minutes, my gf is 10min away and my friends are 20min away. Based on my research, there is no good place I could move that would optimize the commute time between the three main locations. If I moved closer to LA but still in OC I would still be an hour away from LA and an hour away from my gf/friends. If I moved to LA I would be close to work but far from the beach, gf and friends. If I lived in LA, I realistically would only be able to surf on weekends because even on my remote days it would be an hour to beach and an hour or more back.\n\nSince I got my remote job, i've been living my life in a way that maximized my happiness and have had that mindset since. Like I said, lately i've wanted a change but now that the change is in front of me, it is frightening to me. What should I do?",

        "content": "Context--\n\nIn 2019, I made the decision to join a bootcamp and learn to code as I graduated from my university as a pre-med student who didn't get into any programs, with no career path in mind. It was very tough, but I got my first job at a 4 person dev shop (was horrible) making $55k a year. I was fired from here because of a an approved vacation I took, and a few months later I got another job at another very small software company where I worked as the only web developer and mobile developer. My skills at this time were react and react native.\n\n\nMy next job was during the COVID boom, 2021, where I finally doubled my salary and started making $115k as a react native mobile dev working for a startup. I felt like I had finally made it in life. I thought I would be promoted to senior, then maybe manager or director, or something like that. I was learning a ton and working with very intelligent people.\n\n\nAfter a year, the market hit the first mass wave of layoffs, in which I was cut. I got lucky and immediately was picked up as a full time contractor for a retail company that you have all heard of, which is where I remain today. I knew this would be a shitty job- its filled with contractors and H1B workers. No one knows a single thing, everything is handed off to someone else, no one wants to collaborate. There is immense pressure from above to find a solution to a problem at all costs, design comes second always. I feel super trapped here. I now work on a team where I maintain 10+ small react native and native android applications, but the code is all 5+ years old and written as spaghetti. I have recently realized that I am not progressing at all in my career and scared im going to be stuck here forever. I have gained some skills in kotlin, jetpack compose, but I can't seem to get a job interview anywhere with 5 YOE as a react native dev. My question to you guys is what am I supposed to be doing right now.\n\nPresent--\n\nMy job is giving me extreme career anxiety. I am basically working at an H1B visa mill whereas I want to be back at a company like my last job where everything flowed better. I am thankful to have a job in this economy but its really starting to affect my mental health working here. I am developing extreme anxiety that my career won't exist in a few years due to AI and offshoring, and in the meanwhile I'm not getting any valuable skills here. I am in serious need of advice as to what the hell I should be doing right now. How do I escape this company? They are giving me more and more responsibility, with no promotion or raise in pay. I am doing more and more non SWE related work as upper management continues to squeeze us from all sides. Am I doomed or is there a way out for me? I don't want to leave tech, but I don't know how to escape this god awful company.  What skills do I need to be developing? What do I need to be doing? Is mobile dev a bad choice? Should I try to switch to back end? Please help me.  I can share my stripped resume if necessary.  I should also add, I am currently fully remote which I think is really bad for my mental health.  I am located in NYC.",

I’d say it’s about 90% of the way there.\n\nRight now though, I need to find work and I know that including the repo for this project would definitely help. The problem is that a lot of the code is sensitive, specifically the model architecture (by far the hardest part to develop) and certain parts of the data pipeline. Because other people are also involved, it’s not my decision to share anything sensitive, even if I’m the one who wrote it. \n\nIf anyone has practical advice please do share!",

I've removed all distractions from my desk (no phone, no internet scrolling) yet my mind wanders for many hours per day, increasingly all 8 of them.\n\nI worry that the abstract problem solving needed to program is just too taxing for me. It's not that I'm not intelligent enough to solve the problems, but the process of solving them is exhausting, if that makes sense.\n\nWhen I started this job I found it tiring but rewarding. I was surprised how good it felt to accomplish work, even if the business use for the software was not overly interesting. Now I just find it tiring, but given the idealness of the arrangement I have little faith changing companies would help long-term. I could try a new career, but I have near-term plans to take advantage of my flexibility and salary to move to a bigger city. And more generally, the pay and benefits of this industry are strong incentives for me to make this work, at least for another 5-10 years. Time off helps somewhat, but I always seem to regress back into this state.\n\nThis is a bit of a vent, but to ask some specific questions: Does this experience resonate with anyone? Does this sound like a patch of burnout, or am I trying to fit myself into a career I simply don't have the temperament for? And if it is burnout, how do I get the spark back?\n\nThanks",

I’ve travelled to most of Europe and US and the cities I like the most are Boston, Zurich and London, in this order.\n\nWhich of them do you think would be best for finding a balance between work, salary, life, good weather, and family (with 2 children) as a Software Engineer? Note that my partner works in IT support.\n\nMoving to Zurich is not that difficult with my EU nationality. In Zurich, except Google, and very few others, pay is quite low compared to the cost of living. Moving here is risky, as I dont want to bet my entire life on Google. Also, in Zurich healthcare is private, and can cost a lot for an entire family. Children are also expensive in Zurich. The chances of buying a flat in Zurich (around 1 milion CHF) are slim. I’d rather have a smaller salary and own my home, as my net worth would be effectively higher. Also, I’d have to learn swiss german, and my children would have to go to school and speak swiss german. They would probably not integrate properly in swiss society with parents that barely speak swiss german.\n\nIn London, there are so many options. There are more jobs than in Boston, Zurich, actually its the city with almost the most CS jobs in the world. Lots of companies offer 150k salaries. The problem in London is the tax system, as between 100k and 125k we are effectively taxed at ~61% and after 125k we are taxed at 45%. Buying a house in London is not as difficult as in Zurich, and there are many options of nice homes. London is a bit unsafe tho, and raising a family comes with additional challenges. Also the weather is too overcast, as Id rather live somewhere colder but sunnier, instead of somewhere with mild weather but cloudy and overcast.\n\nMoving to Boston would be the most difficult. It is feasible as I have a PhD and many first author research papers at reputable venues, so I could get an EB2 NIW green card visa. Buying a flat in Boston would be the easiest compared to London and Zurich. Boston is safer than London. Boston has the most high paying jobs compared to London and Zurich. It also has the most sunshine compared to London and Zurich. However, healthcare is private and I assume it would be expensive for an entire family. Also, I would have very little annual leave in Boston, as in Europe there are about 5 weeks of annual leave each year\n\n\n",

I completed assignments and passed classes, but I feel like I never deeply learned or retained the fundamentals of programming and cs theory.\n\nDespite that, the company surprisingly invited me to do a 90-minute follow-up whiteboarding session. I really want to redeem myself and prep properly. The task involves working on a Java project live, identifying bad coding practices, improving the code, and explaining my reasoning — kind of like a debugging/design/code-improvement challenge. I want to take this chance but I'm also nervous about embarrassing myself lol.\n\nMy issue is I feel like I’ve forgotten everything: syntax, core concepts, how to think like an engineer. I also struggle with memory/brain fog, so I tend to Google even basic things — but obviously that doesn’t work well in a live coding setting. Maybe I need a different approach to how I study code? When I do leetcode problems and such I do them but I don't know if they fully stick with me.\n\nAny advice or methods for how to quickly relearn and reinforce the fundamentals? Are there any structured courses or certs that helped you rebuild your CS foundation? Leetcode is helpful, but I feel like I need more than just solving problems — I need to understand why and how again.\n\nI know I might get some \"you're cooked\" comments, but I am really trying to get back into rhythm again. Thank you!!",

At my last job, I was part time doing C# interfaces for a production line, keeping track of where the process is at. At my job right now, I'm part time doing a program to help an employee manage warehouse units.\n\nBut I've never done full time development and I'm thinking probably a lot of companies could benefit from quality of life improvement by making personalized programs.\n\nHas any of you ever worked self employed making custom programs? If so, how would you process to find potential clients?\n\nThanks!",

The rapid progress in AI — especially in frontend automation — has made me rethink my long-term career path. I'm not in a rush or unhappy with my job, but I want to proactively adapt before I get left behind.\n\nI don’t have any hands-on experience in backend, cloud, or data infrastructure, but I’m highly motivated to learn and transition into a role that's more aligned with the direction the industry is heading.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n\n* A role that’s realistic to transition into from a frontend/mobile background\n* Not buried in academic research or deep theory\n* Clear roadmap and growth potential\n* Future-proof against the growing AI automation trend\n\nMy questions to the community:\n\n1. Are there specific AI-related or AI-adjacent roles you’d recommend for someone with my background?\n2. Which paths offer the most practical entry point and learning curve from mobile/Android experience?\n3. Are there resources, roadmaps, or beginner-friendly projects you’d recommend?\n4. Has anyone made a similar transition — what was your biggest challenge or key takeaway?\n\nThanks a lot in advance.",
