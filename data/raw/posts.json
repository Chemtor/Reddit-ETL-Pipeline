The rest of us end up picking up the slack, and it’s starting to affect team morale and delivery.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with a “know-it-all but lazy” type like this?

What annoys me are not the posts themselves, but the culture and the companies making believe that all this is necessary. So i feel like people need to manage their expectations. In themselves and  in the companies they work for. The following are OPINIONS of mine that help me to check in with myself.\n\n1. You are not the company and the company is not you. If they want you to use a new tool, they need to provide PAID time for you to learn the tool.\n\n2. Don't do personal projects (unless you REALLY enjoy it). It just takes time you could have spend doing literally anything else. Personal projects will not prepare you for the real thing because the data isn't as messy,  the business is not as annoying and you want have to deal with coworkers breaking production pipelines. \n\n3. Nobody cares about certifications. If I have to do a certification, I want to be paid for it and not pay for it.\n\n4. Life over work. Always.\n\n5. Don't beat yourself up, if you don't know something. It's fine. Try it out and fail. Try again. (During work hours of course)\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, i read stuff in my offtime as well and i am in this reddit. But i only as long I enjoy it. Don't feel pressured to do anything because you think you need it for your career or some youtube guy told you to.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\nI’m a data engineer with about 1 year of experience working in a 7 persons' BI team, and I’m the only data engineer there.\n\nRecently I realized I’ve been working extra hours for free. I deployed a local Git server, maintain and own the DB instance that hosts our DWH, re-implemented and redesigned Python dashboards because the old implementation was slow and useless, deployed some infrastructure for data engineering workloads, developed cli frameworks to cut-off manual work and code redundancy, and harmonized inconsistent sources to produce accurate insights (they used to just dump Excel files and DB tables into SSIS, which generated wrong numbers) all locally.\n\nLast Thursday, we got a request with a deadline on Sunday, even though Friday and Saturday are our weekend (I’m in Egypt, and my team is currently working from home to deliver it, for free).\n\nAt first, I didn’t mind because I wanted to deliver and learn, but now I’m getting frustrated. I barely have time to rest, let alone learn new things that could actually help me grow (technically or financially).\n\nUnpaid overtime is normalized here, and changing companies locally won’t fix that. So I’ve started thinking about moving to Europe, but I’m not sure I’m ready for such a competitive market since everything we do is on-prem and I’ve never touched cloud platforms.\n\nAnother issue: I feel like the only technical person in the office. When I talk about software design, abstraction, or maintainability, nobody really gets it. They just think I’m “going fancy,” which leaves me on-call. \n\nOne time, I recommended loading all our sources into a 3rd normal form schema as a single source of truth, because the same piece of information was scattered across multiple systems and needed tracking, enforcement, and auditing before hitting our Kimball DWH. They looked at me like I was a nerd trying to create extra work.\n\nI’m honestly feeling trapped.\nShould I keep grinding, or start planning my exit to a better environment (like Europe or remote)?\nAny advice from people who’ve been through this?\n\n\nEdit:\nThe management decided to compensate us with additional annual leave, and I found out that our senior engineer has been negotiating with management for a salary raise for the entire department after these rough days. I think there’s something I’m missing.",

        "content": "Hi!\n\nAs part of a client I’m working with, I was planning to migrate quite an old data platform to what many would consider a modern data stack (dagster/airlfow + DBT + data lakehouse). Their current data estate is quite outdated (e.g. single step function manually triggered, 40+ state machines running lambda scripts to manipulate data. Also they’re on Redshit and connect to Qlik for BI. I don’t think they’re willing to change those two), and as I just recently joined, they’re asking me to modernise it. The modern data stack mentioned above is what I believe would work best and also what I’m most comfortable with. \n\nNow the question is, as DBT has been acquired by Fivetran a few weeks ago, how would you tackle the migration to a completely new modern data stack? Would DBT still be your choice even if not as “open” as it was before and the uncertainty around maintenance of dbt-core? Or would you go with something else? I’m not aware of any other tool like DBT that does such a good job in transformation.\n\nAm I unnecessarily worrying and should I still go with proposing DBT? Sorry if a similar question has been asked already but couldn’t find anything on here.\n\nThanks!",

I always wanted to work in a data engineering project and recently i got an opportunity to work on a project which seem to be exciting with GenAI & Python stuff. My role here is to develop python scripts to integrate multiple sources and LLM outputs and package everything into a solution. I designed a config driven ETL code using python and wrote multiple classes to package everything into a single codebase. I used LLM chats to optimise my code. Due to very tight deadlines I had to rush the development without realising the whole thing would turn into a nightmare. I have tried my best to follow the coding standards but the client is very upset about few parts of the design. A couple of days ago, I had a code review meeting with my client team where I had to walk through my code and answer questions inorder to get the approval for QA. The client team had an architect level manager who had already gone through the repository and had a lot of valid questions about the design flaws in the code. I felt very embarrassed during the meeting and it was a very awkward conversation. Everytime he had pointed out something wrong, I had no answers to it and there was silence for about half a minute before I say \" Ok I can implement that\". I know it is my fault that I didn't have enough knowledge about designing data systems but I'm worried more about tarnishing my companies' reputation by providing a low quality deliverable. I just wanted to rant about how disappointed I feel about myself. Have you ever been in a situation like this?",

        "author": "GehDichWaschen",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nTLDR: The team prefers SSIS over Airflow, I want to convince them to accept the switch as a long term goal.\n\nI am a Senior Data Engineer and I started at an SME earlier this year.\n\nPreviously I used a lot of Cloud Services, like AWS BatchJob for the ETL of an Kubernetes application, EC2 with airflow in docker-compose, developed API endpoints for a frontend Application using sqlalchemy at a big company, worked TDD in Scrum etc.\n\nHere, I found the current setup of the ETL pipeline to be a massive library of SSIS Packages basically getting data from an on prem ERP to a Reporting Model.\n\nThere are no tests, there are many small-small hacky ways inside SSIS to get what you want out of the data. The is no style guide or Review Process. In general it's lacking the usual oversight you would have in a \\*\\*searchable\\*\\* code project as well as the capability to run tests on the system and databases. git is not really used at all. Documentation is hardly maintained\n\nEverything is being worked on in the Visual Studio UI, which is buggy at best and simply crashing at worst (around twice per day).\n\nI work in a 2-person team and our Job it is to manage the SSIS ETL, Tabular Model and all PowerBI Reports throughout the company. The two of us are the entire reporting team.\n\nI replaced a long-time employee that has been in the company for around 15 years and didn't know any code and left minimal documentation.  \n\nGenerally my colleague (data scientist) does documentation only in his personal notebook which he shares sporadically on request.\n\n\n\nSince my start I introduced JIRA for our processes with a clear task board (it was a mess before) and bi-weekly sprints. Also a Wiki which I filled with hundreds of pages by now. I am currently introducing another tool, so at least we don't have to use buggy VS to manage the tabular model and can use git there as well.\n\nI am transforming all our PBI reports into .pbip files, so we can work with git there, too (We have like 100 reports).\n\nAlso, I built an entire prod Airflow Environment on an on-prem Windows server to be able to query APIs (not possible in SSIS) and run some basic statistical analysis (\"AI-capabilities\"). The Airflow repo is fully tested, has Exception Handling, feature and hotfix branches, dev, prod etc. and can be used locally as well as on remote.\n\nBut I am the only one currently maintaining it. My colleague does not want to change to Airflow, because \"the other one is working\". \n\nFact is, I am losing a lot of time managing SSIS in VS while getting a lower quality system.\n\nPlus, if we ever want to hire an additional colleague, he will probably face the same issues as I do (no docs, massive monolith, no search function, etc.) and will probably not get a good hire.\n\nMy boss is non-technical, so he is not of much help. We are also not in IT, so every time the SQL Server bugs, we need to run to the IT department to fix our ETL Job, which can take days.\n\nSo, how can I convince my colleague to eventually switch to Airflow?\n\nIt doesn't need to be today, but I want this to be a committed long term goal.\n\nWriting this, I feel I have committed so much to this company already and would really like to give them a chance (preference of industry and location)\n\nThank you all for reading, maybe you have some insight how to handle this. I would rather not quit on this, but might be my only option.",

You can render tables straight from your source code to a standalone HTML file - no notebook needed.\n\nThere’s already the well-known *itables* package, but `df2tables` is a bit different:\n\n* Fewer dependencies (just pandas *or* polars)\n* Column controls automatically match data types (numbers, dates, categories)\n* can outside notebooks – render directly to HTML\n* customize DataTables behavior **directly from Python**\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/ts-kontakt/df2tables](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/df2tables)",

From there so far so good.\n\nIn dbt, our source points only to the latest file.\nThen we have an incremental model that:\nApply business logic , detected updated columns, build history columns (valid from valid to etc)\n\nMy issue: our history is only inside an incremental model , we can’t do full refresh. The pipeline is not reproducible\n\nMy proposal: add a raw table in between the data lake and dbt \n\nBut received some pushback form business: \n1. We will never do a full refresh \n2. If we ever do, we can just restore the db backup \n3. You will increase dramatically the storage on the db \n4. If we lose the lake or the db, it’s the same thing anyway \n5. We already have the data lake to need everything \n\nHow can I frame my argument to the business ? \n\nIt’s a huge company with tons of business people watching the project burocracy etc.\n\nEDIT: my idea to create another table will be have a “bronze layer” raw layer whatever you want to call it to store all the parquet data, at is a snapshot , add a date column. With this I can reproduce the whole dbt project ",

        "content": "I've been working on a gradient boosting implementation that handles two problems I kept running into with XGBoost/LightGBM in production:\n\n1. **Performance collapse on extreme imbalance (under 1% positive class)**\n2. **Silent degradation when data drifts (sensor drift, behavior changes, etc.)**\n\nKey Results\n\nImbalanced data (Credit Card Fraud - 0.2% positives):\n\n**- PKBoost: 87.8% PR-AUC**\n\n**- LightGBM: 79.3% PR-AUC**\n\n**- XGBoost: 74.5% PR-AUC**\n\nUnder realistic drift (gradual covariate shift):\n\n\\- PKBoost: 86.2% PR-AUC (−2.0% degradation)\n\n\\- XGBoost: 50.8% PR-AUC (−31.8% degradation)\n\n\\- LightGBM: 45.6% PR-AUC (−42.5% degradation)\n\n\n\n **What's Different**\n\nThe main innovation is using Shannon entropy in the split criterion alongside gradients. Each split maximizes:\n\n\n\nGain = GradientGain + λ·InformationGain\n\n\n\nwhere λ adapts based on class imbalance. This explicitly optimizes for information gain on the minority class instead of just minimizing loss.\n\nCombined with:\n\n\\- Quantile-based binning (robust to scale shifts)\n\n\\- Conservative regularization (prevents overfitting to majority)\n\n\\- PR-AUC early stopping (focuses on minority performance)\n\nThe architecture is inherently more robust to drift without needing online adaptation.\n\n Trade-offs\n\nThe good:\n\n\\- Auto-tunes for your data (no hyperparameter search needed)\n\n\\- Works out-of-the-box on extreme imbalance\n\n\\- Comparable inference speed to XGBoost\n\nThe honest:\n\n\\- \\~2-4x slower training (45s vs 12s on 170K samples)\n\n\\- Slightly behind on balanced data (use XGBoost there)\n\n\\- Built in Rust, so less Python ecosystem integration\n\n Why I'm Sharing\n\nThis started as a learning project (built from scratch in Rust), but the drift resilience results surprised me. I haven't seen many papers addressing this - most focus on online learning or explicit drift detection.\n\nLooking for feedback on:\n\n\\- Have others seen similar robustness from conservative regularization?\n\n\\- Are there existing techniques that achieve this without retraining?\n\n\\- Would this be useful for production systems, or is 2-4x slower training a dealbreaker?\n\n\n\n Links\n\n\\- GitHub: [https://github.com/Pushp-Kharat1/pkboost](https://github.com/Pushp-Kharat1/pkboost)\n\n\\- Benchmarks include: Credit Card Fraud, Pima Diabetes, Breast Cancer, Ionosphere\n\n\\- MIT licensed, \\~4000 lines of Rust\n\nHappy to answer questions about the implementation or share more detailed results. Also open to PRs if anyone wants to extend it (multi-class support would be great).\n\n\\---\n\n**Edit**: Built this on a 4-core Ryzen 3 laptop with 8GB RAM, so the benchmarks should be reproducible on any hardware.",

If you've tuned ClickHouse for TPC-H-style workloads at these scales on r5d.\\* instances (or similar) and can share concrete settings, join rewrites, or schema choices that move the needle on **Q04/Q08/Q09/Q18/Q19/Q21** in particular, I'd appreciate detailed pointers.\n\nSpecifically, I'm looking for advice on:\n\n**1. Join strategy and memory**\n\n* Recommended settings for large, many-to-many joins on TPC-H shapes (e.g., guidance on `join_algorithm` choices and thresholds for spilling vs in-memory)\n* Practical values for `max_bytes_in_join`, `max_rows_in_join`, `max_bytes_before_external_*` to reduce spill/regressions on Q04/Q18/Q19/Q21\n* Whether using grace hash or partial/merge join strategies is advisable on SF30+ when relations don't fit comfortably in RAM\n\n**2. Optimizer + statistics**\n\n* Which statistics materially influence join reordering and predicate pushdown for TPC-H-like SQL (and how to scope them: which tables/columns, histograms, sampling granularity)\n* Any caveats where cost-based changes often harm (Q04/Q14 patterns), and how to constrain the optimizer to avoid those plans\n\n**3. Query-level idioms**\n\n* Preferred ClickHouse-native patterns for EXISTS/NOT EXISTS (especially Q21) that avoid full scans/aggregations while keeping memory under control\n* When to prefer IN/SEMI/ANTI joins vs INNER/LEFT; reliable anti-join idioms that plan well in 25.9\n* Safe uses of PREWHERE, `optimize_move_to_prewhere`, and read-in-order for these queries\n\n**4.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "As part of a wider move towards data products as well as building better controls into our pipelines, we’re looking at how we can implement data contracts as code. I’ve done a number of proof of concepts across various options and currently the Open Data Contract Specification alongside datacontract-cli is looking good. However, while I see how it can work well with “frozen” contracts, I start getting lost on how to allow schema evolution. \n\nOur typical scenarios for Python-based data ingestion pipelines are all batch-based, consisting of files being pushed to us or our pulling from database tables. Our ingestion pattern is to take the producer dataset, write it to parquet for performant operations, and then validate it with schema and quality checks. The write to parquet (with PyArrow’s ParquetWriter) should include the contract schema to enforce the agreed or known datatypes. \n\nHowever, with dynamic schema evolution, you ideally need to capture the schema of the dataset to be able to compare it to your current contract state to alert for breaking changes etc. Contract-first formats like ODCS take a bit of work to define, plus you may have zero-padded numbers defined as varchar in the source data you want to preserve, so inferring that schema for comparison becomes challenging. \n\nI’ve gone down quite a rabbit hole now and am likely overcooking it, but my current thinking is to write all dataset fields to parquet as string, validate the data formats are as expected, and then subsequent pipeline steps can be more flexible with inferred schemas. I think I can even see a way to integrate this with dlt. \n\nHow do others approach this?",

        "content": "Background: the enterprise DE in my org manages the big data environment.  He uses nifi for orchestration and snowflake for the data warehouse. As far as how his environment is actually put together and communicating all I know is that he uses zookeeper for his nifi cluster and it’s on the cloud (Azure). There is no one who knows anything more than that. No one in IT. Not his boss. Not his one employee. No one knows and his reason is that he doesn’t trust anyone and they aren’t good enough, not even his employee.\n\n\nThe discussion. Have you dealt with such a person? How has your org dealt with people gatekeeping like this? \n\nFrom my perspective this is a massive problem and basically means that this guy is a massive walking pile of technical debt. If he leaves then the clean up and troubleshooting to figure out what he did would be immense.  On top of that he now has suggested taking over smaller DE processes from other outside IT as a play to “centralize” data engineering work. He won’t let them migrate their stuff to his environment as again he doesn’t rust them to be good enough and doesn’t want to teach them how to use his environment. So he is just safe guarding his job really and taking away others jobs in my opinion.  I also recently got some people in IT to approve me setting up Airflow outside of IT and to do data engineering (which I was already doing but just with cron). He has thrown some shots at me but I ignored him because I’m trying to set something up for other people to use to and document it so that it can be maintained should I leave.\n\nTLDR have you dealt with people gatekeeping knowledge and what happened to them?",

Therefore, I want to download the files and store them temporarily, upload them to Google Drive and then remove them.\n\nFirst, I tried to download them to a lakehouse, but I then understood that removing files in Lakehouse is only a soft-delete and that it still stores it for 7 days, and I want to avoid being billed for all those GBs...\n\nSo, to my question. ChatGPT proposed that I download the files into a folder like \"/tmp/\\*filename.csv\\*\", and supposedly when I do that I use the ephemeral memory created when running the notebook, and then the files will be automatically removed when the notebook is finished running.\n\nThe solution works and I cannot see the files in my lakehouse, so from my point of view the solution works. BUT, I cannot find any documentation of using this method, so I am curious as to how this really works? Have any of you used this method before? Are the files really deleted after the notebook finishes? Is there any better way of doing this? \n\n  \nThankful for any answers!\n\n ",

I am not an expert, but I can build things, and I use AI occasionally to speed up problem solving rather than spending hours searching on StackOverflow.\n\nTo make my learning practical, I built an end to end project:\n\nS&P 500 Dashboard\n\nBuilt using Python, pandas, plotly and streamlit\n\nContainerised using Docker\n\nFull documentation, requirements and code pushed to GitHub\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nYou can select any S&P 500 stock from a dropdown\n\nThe graph updates to show its historical price from the date it entered the index\n\nUsers can enter how much they want to invest monthly and for how long, and it estimates projected returns based on historic performance\n\nIt highlights rolling averages (30 day, 90 day etc) so users can easily spot patterns and trends\n\n\nIt is not the most advanced app in the world, but for a first build I am proud of it. It is functional, interactive and shows thinking across the whole process: data collection, transformation, visualisation and deployment.\n\nHere is where I am struggling:\n\nI am up at 5am every day to study before work. I continue after work and on weekends. I am investing a huge amount of time into learning this, but I do not know how to actually get someone to give me a chance at a junior or entry level data engineering role. I know that if someone hired me, I would happily keep learning in my own time and grow into the role.\n\nMy question is: how do I get noticed?\n\nAre there specific projects that employers look for?\n\nDo recruiters actually care about GitHub portfolios?\n\nShould I focus on AWS or Azure certifications next?\n\nHow do you overcome the problem of having no direct DE experience yet?\n\n\nIf you have made this transition, or you work in data engineering and hire junior candidates, I would appreciate any advice. I am motivated, I am learning constantly and I just want a foot in the door.\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance.",

        "content": "Hello everyone, I'm doing a part time as a customer service for an online class. I basically manage the students, their related informations, sessions bought, etc. Also relates it to the class that they are enrolled in. At the moment, all this information is stored in a monolithic sheets (well I did divide atleast the student data and the class, connect them by id).\n\nBut, I'm a CS student, and I just studied dbms last semester, this whole premise sounds like a perfect case to implement what I learn and design a relational database!\n\nSo, I'm here to crosscheck my plan. I plan this with gpt.. btw, because I can't afford to spend too much time working on this side project, and I'm not going to be paid for this extra work either, but then I believe this will help me a ton at my work, and I will also learn a bunch after designing the schema and seeing in real time how the database grows.\n\nSo the plan is use a local instance of postgreSQL with a frontend like NocoDB for spreadsheets like interface. So then I have the fallback of using NocoDB to edit my data, or when I can, and I will try to, always use SQL, or atleast make my own interface to manage the data.\n\nHere's some considerations why I should move to this approach:\n1. The monolithic sheets, one spreadsheets have too much column (phone number, name, classes bought, class id, classes left, last class date, note, complains, (sales related data like age, gender, city, learning objective). And just yesterday, I had a call with my manager, and she says that I should also includes payment information, and 2 types of complains, and I was staring at the long list of the data in the spreadsheets..\n2. I have a pain point of syncing two different sheets. So my company uses other service of spreadsheets (not google) and there is coworker that can't access this site from their country. So, I, again, need to update both of this spreadsheet, and the issue is my company have trust issue with google, so I would also need to filter some data before putting it into the google spreadsheet, from the company one. Too much hassle.\nWhat I hope to achievr from migrating to sql, is that I can just sync them both to my local instance of SQL instead of from one to the other.\n\ncons of this approach (that i know of):\nThis infrastructure will then depends on me, and I think I would need a no-code solution in the future if there will be other coworker in my position. \n\nOther approach being considered:\n Just refactore the sheets that mimics relational db (students, classes, enrolls_in, teaches_in, payment, complains)\nBut then having to filter and sync across the other sheets will still be an issue.\n\nI've read a post somewhere about a teacher that tried to do this kind of thing, basically a student management system. And then it just became a burden for him, needing him to maintain an ecosystem without being paid for it.\n\nBut from what I see, this approach seems need little maintenance and effort to keep up, so only the initial setup will be hard. But feel free to prove me wrong!\n\nThat's about it, I hope you all can give me insights whether or not this journey I'm about to take will be fruitful. I'm open to other suggestions and critics!",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a beginner data engineer (~1 yoe in DE), we have built a python ingestion framework that does the following:\n\n1. Fetches data in chunks from RDS table\n2. Loads dataframes to Snowflake tables using put stream to SF stage and COPY INTO.\n\nConfig for each source table in RDS, target table in Snowflake, filters to apply etc are maintained in a snowflake table which is fetched before each Ingestion Job.\nThese ingestion jobs need to run on a schedule, therefore we created cronjobs on an on-prem VM (yes, 1 VM) that triggers the python ingestion script (daily, weekly, monthly for different source tables).\nWe are moving to EKS by containerizing the ingestion code and using Kubernetes Cronjobs to achieve the same behaviour as earlier (cronjobs in VM). There are other options like Glue, Spark etc but client wants EKS, so we went with it. Our team is also pretty new, so we lack experience to say \"Hey, instead of EKS, use this\". \nThe ingestion module is just a bunch of python scripts with some classes and functions. How much can performance be improved if I follow a worker pattern where workers pull from a job queue (AWS SQS?) and do just plain extract and load from rds to snowflake. The workers can be deployed as a kubernetes deployment with scalable replicas of workers. A master pod/deployment can handle orchestration of job queue (adding, removing, tracking ingestion jobs).\nI beleive this approach can scale well compared to Cronjobs approach where each pod that handles ingestion job can only have access to finite resources enforced by resources.limits.cpu and mem.\n\nPlease give me your suggestions regarding the current approach and new design idea. Feel free to ridicule, mock, destroy my ideas. As a beginner DE i want to learn best practices when it comes to data ingestion particularly at scale. At what point do i decide to switch from existing to a better pattern?\n\nThanks in advance!!!",

        "author": "fabkosta",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Recently I have been contemplating the idea of a \"data ontology\" on top of Apache Iceberg. The idea is that within a domain you can change data schema in any way you intend using default Apache Iceberg functionality. However, when you publish a data product such that it can be consumed by other data domains then the schema of your data product is frozen, and there is some technical enforcement of the data schema such that the upstream provider domain cannot simply break the schema of the data product thus causing trouble for the downstream consumer domain. Whenever a schema change of the data product is required then the upstream provider domain must go through an official change request with version control etc. that must be accepted by the downstream consumer domain.\n\nObviously, building the full product would be highly complicated with all the bells and whistles attached. But building a small PoC to showcase could be achievable in a realistic timeframe.\n\nNow, I have been wondering:\n\n1. What do you generally think of such an idea? Am I onto something here? Would there be demand for this? Would Apache Iceberg be the right tech for that?\n\n2. I could not find this idea implemented anywhere. There are things that come close (like Starburst's data catalogue) but nothing that seems to actually technically enforce schema change for data products. From what I've seen most products seem to either operate at a lower level (e.g. table level or file level), or they seem to not actually enforce data product schemas but just describe their schemas. Am I missing something here?",

        "content": "# \n\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm working solo on the data infrastructure at our manufacturing facility, and I'm hitting some roadblocks I'd like to get your thoughts on.\n\n**The Setup**\n\nWe use an Oracle-based ERP system that's pretty restrictive. I've filtered their fact tables down to show only active jobs on our floor, and most of our reporting centers around that data. I built a Go ETL program that pulls data from Oracle and pushes it to Postgres every hour (currently moving about 1k rows per pull). My next step was to use dbt to build out proper dimensions and new fact tables.\n\n**Why the Migration?**\n\nThe company moved their on-premise Oracle database to Azure, which has tanked our Power BI and Excel report performance. On top of that, the database account they gave us for reporting doesn't have access to materialized views, can't create indexes, or schedule anything. We're basically locked into querying views-on-top-of-views with no optimization options.\n\n**Where I'm Stuck**\n\nI've hit a few walls that are keeping me from moving forward:\n\n1. **Development environment**: The dbt plugin is deprecated in IntelliJ, and the VS Code version is pretty rough. SqlMesh doesn't really solve this either. What tools do you all use for writing this kind of code?\n2. **Historical tracking**: The ERP uses object versions and business keys built by concatenating two fields with a `^` separator. This makes incremental syncing really difficult. I'm not sure how to handle this cleanly.\n3. **Dimension table design**: Since I'm filtering to only active jobs to keep row volume down, my dimension tables grow and shrink. That means I have to truncate them on each run instead of maintaining a proper slowly changing dimension. I know it's not ideal, but I'm not sure what the better approach would be here.\n\nYour advice would be appreicated. I dont have anyone in my company to talk to about this and I want to make good decisions to help my company move from the stoneage into something modern.\n\nThanks! ",

        "content": "Some fact tables are fairly straightforward, others can be very complicated. I'm working on a extremely complicated composite metric fact table, the output metric is computed queries/combinations/logic from \\~15 different business process fact tables. From a quality standpoint I am very concerned about transparency and explainability of this final metric. So, in addition to the metric value, I'm also considering writing to the fact the values which were used to create the desired metric, with their vintage and other characteristics. So, for example if the metric M=A+B+C-D-E+F-G+H-I; then I would not only store each value, but also the point in time it was pulled from source \\[some of these values are very volatile and are essentially sub queries with logic/filters\\]. For example: A\\_Value = xx, B\\_Value = yyy, C\\_value = zzzz, A\\_TimeStamp = 10/24/25 3:56AM, B\\_Timestamp = 10/24/25 1:11AM, C\\_Timestamp = 10/24/25 6:47AM.\n\nYou can see here that M was created using data from very different points of time, and in this case the data can change a lot within a few hours. \\[data is not only being changed by a 24x7 global business, but also by system batch processing on schedule\\] If someone else uses the same formula, but data from later points in time they might get a different result (and yes, we would ideally wish A,B,C...  to be from the same point in time). \n\n\n\nIs this a design pattern being used? Is there a better way? Is there resources I can use to learn more about this? \n\n  \n\n\nAgain, I wouldn't use this in all designs, only those of sufficient complexity to create better visibility as to \"why the value is what it is\" (when others might disagree and argue because they used the same formula with data from different points in time or filters). \n\n\\*\\* note: I'm considering techniques to ensure all formula components are from the same \"time\" (aka: using time travel in Snowflake, or similar techniques) - but for this question, I'm only concerned about the data modeling to capture/record artifacts used for data quality / explainability.

How should I handle this in our data warehouse?\n\nI’m thinking of updating the ExamKey value in Fact\\_Exam and Fact\\_Result to a default value like -1 that corresponds to Exam ID 123, and then deleting that Exam ID 123 row from the Exam table.\n\nI’m not sure if this is even the correct approach. Also, considering that the ExamKey is used in many other fact tables, I don’t think this is an efficient process, as I’d have to check and update several fact tables before deleting.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "At work (30-person B2B SaaS), we’re currently debating evolving our data schema. The founders cobbled something together 10 years ago on AWS and through some patching and upgrading, we’ve scaled to 10,000 users, typically sales reps.\n\nOne challenge we’ve long faced is data analysis. We take raw JSON records from CRMs/VOIPs/etc, filter them using conditions, and turn them into performance records on another table. These “promoted” JSON records are then pushed to RedShift where we can do some deeper analysis (such as connecting companies and contacts together, or tying certain activities back to deals, and then helping clients to answer more complex questions than “how many meetings have my team booked this week?”). Without going much deeper, going from performance records back to JSON records and connecting them to associated records but only those that have associated performance… Yeah, it’s not great. \n\nThe evolved data schema we’re considering is a star schema making use of our own model that can transform records from various systems into this model’s common format. So “company” records from Salesforce, HubSpot, and half a dozen all CRMs are all represented relatively similarly (maybe a few JSON properties we’d keep in a JSON column for display only). \n\nCurrent tables we’re sat on are dimensions for very common things like users, companies, and contacts. Facts are for activities (calls, emails, meetings, tasks, notes etc) and deals.\n\nMy worry is that any case of a star schema being used that I’ve come across has been for internal analytics - very rarely a multi-tenant architecture for customer data. We’re prototyping with Tinybird which sits on top of Clickhouse. There’s a lot of stuff for us to consider around data deletion, custom properties per integration and so on, but that’s for another day. \n\nDoes this overall approach sit ok with you? Anything feel off or set off alarm bells? \n\nAppreciate any thoughts or comments!",

While I am currently using Postgres, my needs are better suited for an OLAP datababase so I am curious if this is still the best option. What are the good options on Vercel for this?\n\nI looked at Motherduck and looks like it is a good option, but one challenge I am seeing is that the WASM client would be exposing the tokens to the customer. Given that it is a multi-tenant applications, I would need to create a user per tennant and do that user management myself. If I go with MotherDuck, my alternative is to move my webapp to a proper nodejs deployment where I don't need to depend on WASM client. Its doable but a lot of overhead to manage.\n\nThis seems like a problem that should already be solved in 2025, AGI is around the corner, this should be easy :D .

I've heard architect is a dying title and don't want to back myself into a corner for future opportunities. We also floated Principal BI Engineer or Principal Data Engineer, but I hardly feel that implementing Stitch and Fivetran for ELT justifies a data engineer title and don't feel my background would line up with that for future opportunities. It may be a moot point if I ever try going for a Director of Analytics role in the future, but not sure if that will ever happen as I've never had direct reports and don't like office politics. I do enjoy being an individual contributor, data governance, and working directly with stakeholders to solve their unique needs on data and reporting. Just trying to better understand what I should call myself, what I should focus on, and where I should try to go to next.\n\nBackground and context below.\n\nI have 14 years experience behind me, with previous roles as Reporting Analyst, Senior Pricing Analyst, Business Analytics Manager, and currently Senior Data Analytics Manager. With leadership and personnel changes in my current company and team, after 3 years of being here my responsibilities have shifted and leadership is open to changing my title, but I'm not sure what direction I should take it.\n\nBack in college I set out to be a Mechanical Engineer; I loved physics, but was failing Calc 2 and panicked and regrettably changed my major to their Business program. When I started my career, I took to Excel and VBA macros naturally because my physics brain just likes to build things. Then someone taught me the first 3 lines of SQL and everything took off from there.\n\nIn my former role as Business Analytics Manager I was an analytics team of 1 for 4 years where I rebuilt everything from the ground. Implemented Stitch for ELT, built standardized data models with materialized views in Redshift, and built dashboards in Periscope (R.I.P.).\n\nI got burnt out as a team of 1 and moved to my current company so I can be a part of a larger team, at first I was hired into the Marketing Department just focusing on standardizing data models and reporting under Marketing, but soon after started supporting Finance and Merchandising as well. We had a Senior Data Architect I worked closely with, as well as a Data Scientist; both of these individuals left and were never backfilled so I'm back to where I started managing all of it, although we've dropped all projects the data scientist was running. I now fall under IT instead of Marketing, and I report to a Director of Analytics who reports to the CTO. We also have 3 offshore analyst resources for dashboard building and ad hoc requests, but they primarily focus on website analytics with GA4.\n\nI'm currently in the process of onboarding Fivetran for the bulk of our data going into BigQuery, and we just signed on with Tableau to consolidate dashboards and various spreadsheets. I will be rebuilding views to utilize the new data pipelines and rebuilding existing dashboards, much like my last company.\n\nWhat I love most about my work is writing SQL, building complex but clean views to normalize/standardize data to make it intuitive for downstream reporting and dashboard building. I loved building dashboards in Periscope because it was 100% SQL driven, most other BI tools I've found limiting by comparison. I know some python, but working in that environment doesn't come naturally to me and I'm way more comfortable writing everything directly in SQL, building dynamic dashboards, and piping my data into spreadsheets in a format the stakeholders like.\n\nI've never truly considered myself an 'analyst' as I don't feel comfortable providing analysis and recommendations, my brain thinks of a thousand different variables as to why that assumption could be misleading. Instead, I like working with the people asking the questions and understanding the nuances of the data being asked about in order to write targeted queries, and let those subject matter experts derive their own conclusions. And while I've always been intrigued by the deeper complexities of data engineering functions and capabilities, there are an endless number of tools and platforms out there that I haven't been exposed to and know little about so I'd feel like a fraud trying to call myself an engineer. At the end of the day I work in data with a mechanical engineering brain rather than a traditional software engineering type, and still struggle to understand what path I should be taking in the future.",

I just can't figure out how to set them up. Any experienced DEs know some tips/sources that could be of help? ",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I would like to share a story about my current experience and the difficulties I am encountering—or rather, about how my expectations are different from reality.﻿\n\nI am a data engineer who has been working in the field of data processing for 25 years now. I believe I have a certain familiarity with these topics, and I have noticed the lack of some tools that would have saved me a lot of time.﻿\n\nAnd that’s how I created a tool (but that’s not the point) that essentially, by taking JSON or XML as input, automatically transforms them into a relational database. It also adapts automatically to changes, always preserving backward compatibility with previously loaded data.﻿\n\nAt the moment, the tool works with databases like PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and Oracle. In the future, I hope to support more (but actually, it could work for all databases, considering that one of these three could be used as a data source after running the tool).﻿\n\nLet me get to the point: in my mind, I thought this tool could be a breakthrough, and a similar product (which I won’t mention here to avoid giving it promotion) actually received an award from Snowflake in 2025 because it was considered very innovative. Basically, that tool does much of what mine does, but mine still has some better features.﻿\n\nNowadays, JSON data is everywhere, and that has been the “fuel” that kept me going while developing it.\n\nA bit against the trend, my tool does not use AI—maybe this is penalizing it, but I want to be genuine and not hide behind this topic just to get more attention. It is also very respectful of privacy, making it suitable for those dealing with personal or sensitive data (basically, part of the process runs on the customer’s premises, and the result can be sent out to get the final product ready to be executed on their own database).﻿\n\nThe ultimate idea is to create a SaaS so that anyone who needs it can access the tool. At the moment, however, I don't have the financial resources to cover the costs of productization, legal fees, patents, and all the necessary expenses. That’s why I thought about offering myself as a consultant providing the transformation service, so that once I receive the input data, clients can start viewing their information in a relational database format\n\nThe difficulties I am facing are surprising me. There are people who consider themselves experts and say that this tool doesn't make sense, preferring to write code themselves to extract the necessary information by reading the data directly from JSON—using, in my opinion, syntaxes that are not easy even for those who know only SQL.﻿\n\nI am now wondering if there truly are people out there with expert knowledge of these topics (which are definitely niche), because I believe that not having to write a single line of code, being able to get a relational database ready for querying with simple queries, tables that are automatically linked in the same way (parent/child fields), and being able to create reports and dashboards in just a few minutes, is truly an added value that today can be found in only a few tools.﻿\n\nI’ll conclude by saying that the estimated minimum ROI, in terms of time—and therefore money—saved for a developer is at least 10x.\n\nI am so confident in my solution that I would also love to hear the opinion of those who face this type of situation daily.\n\nThank you to everyone who has read this post and is willing to share their thoughts.\n\n  \n",

        "title": "I'm a MS student in my last year, should I go back to my old company or should I go with a new I interned for over the summer?",
        "author": "DataByte7389",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Background: I’m finishing up my last year in my M.S. program studying a mixture of Data Analytics and Information Systems. Before grad school, I spent a little over 4 years working remotely at a med-tech startup (around 500 people) in product management. It was a great learning experience but also very stressful. They constantly overloaded me, interfered with my school schedule (when I was working part-time in undergrad), worked late into the night constantly, and broke promises around pay and promotions.\n\nI eventually left when I started my master’s, mainly for my own sanity and so I could focus on my health, school, and my relationship. I made sure to leave on good terms since I still really like the company and the products they are creating. It’s a small, niche industry, so I wanted to keep that bridge intact.\n\nThis past summer, I interned at a manufacturing company that works in the AI/data center space. My role started as Systems Analyst but turned into more of a Data Engineering internship by the end of it. I learned a lot, but the culture was rough on my team. They didn’t really want an intern, and it was a pretty cold and dry environment with them being too busy to interact with me the whole summer. I very much had to figure out a lot of things on my own since I had to use tools and create projects I never had experience with ever. To add, this was just an issue with the team I was on, other interns had a great time on different teams. It made me consistently miss the energy and connection I had with my old coworkers at the startup, which is something I think I value a lot on a team.\n\n-Decision-\n\nThe manufacturing company gave me a full-time offer for after graduation. It is a Sr Engineer role with a total comp of 145k (Yearly Breakdown: $105k base + 10% bonus + around 30k in stock). It’s stable, the benefits are great, and they even mentioned I might rotate through different engineering areas to choose a spot I like. But most likely due to company necessity I will end up in the same team (Data Engineering) I was with before since they are spread extremely thin. I am nervous about the role since they are asking me to do projects that I have little to no experience doing with little support just like the internship. It makes me afraid (A bit of imposter syndrome?) that I will not succeed in the role since I come from a more business / analytics background. \n\nBut recently I also got contacted by my old company, who’s entering a big growth phase, and they asked if I’d consider coming back to the product team after graduation. They’ve made promises that they’ve reduced a lot of the work and the emergency late nights by creating a new team to manage them. I would focus more on actual product management and problem solving if I came back. They implied they would consider hiring me remotely again but are pushing for me to instead relocate to their HQ (based in Seattle when I am currently on the east coast). I’ve not received an offer yet as we are going back and forth still but I am familiar with the salary range based off of my co-workers. Estimated Breakdown: 80-97k Base + 10-15% Bonus + 12.5k in RSUs. \n\nPart of me wants to go back because I really loved the people and the work. But I’m scared of ending up in the same stressful situations again along with all the promises that were broken before and if they can keep them. Also scared that I won’t have much growth since they do not promote often in PM. On the other hand, the new company is stable and pays well with clear expectations but doesn’t excite me the same way as well with other fears about the position and team.\n\nHow should I proceed? Also another thing I’m thinking about is long term on which role will let me best pursue other growth opportunities and not plateau early in my career. Any advice would be appreciated even if its outside the scope of my question.\n",

Let me give some generic advice: try doing it without AI.\n\nIn the olden times, it was not uncommon for learners to have a project that did not work, and they could not figure out why. Now, thanks to AI, learners have a project that does work, and they can't figure out why.\n\nAI is not always bad or evil, but likewise, it definitely isn't always helpful. Learning requires reading, trying, making mistakes, getting confused, reading more, trying more, and repeating. \n\nStart small -- there's a reason \"hello world\" is a common first task -- the actual coding is ridiculously simple, but it proves that your have done all of the necessary work to get your environment properly running. Once you've got that working, you can move on to something more complicated.\n\nI've seen a lot of people who, with the help of AI, start with a much bigger project. AI helps them get that bigger project running, but they don't fully understand what was done to reach that point, which means they're not able to successfully make changes or fixes to that project.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with googling. There's nothing wrong with asking AI a question. But your best bet is to spend some time thinking and trying on your own before using either tool. My advice to anyone learning with AI: don't let AI read or write your code. If you're going to ask AI questions, do so in English. Use AI to help you find the terminology that you don't yet know, and once you've learned the right words, spend some time reading about what they mean. ",

        "content": "This is what I understand. I kind of need some basic explanation to know where to look for things when I want to get deeper into this.\n\n  \nTCP and UDP are part of the **transport layer** in the tcp/ip stack and all layers up to that one are implemented by the **os kernel**. So my application won't have to implement it, it would use **system calls**.\n\nFor a web application a **client** and my **server** will communicate. The client will open a **tcp connection** with the correct **socket** ( ip : port 80 or 443 ) of my server. The client is e.g. the browser.\n\nSo now we have client and server with an open **tcp connection**.\n\n  \n**HTTP** is a protocol in the **application layer** in the tcp/ip stack so it has to be implemented by an application. In a nutshell, http is basically just a standard for how the string of text sent over the tcp connection is structured to be valid.\n\nThe **webserver** thats being communicated with is an application, so it implements the HTTP protocol. It can either serve static files or call programs or scripts and give the **request data** as a parameter. The application can then produce an answer. No matter if static or dynamic content is served, pretty much the webserver responds to the request it received\n\n\n\nSo that's my basic understanding at I think its correct. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here already.\n\nTLS is also an application layer protocol, so it has to be implemented by an application. I heard of libraries like OpenSSL implementing them.\n\nBut where do I **turn on HTTPS** now? Since the server has to be able to serve static content or forward requests to an application or a script, I'd guess in the server? But what if my application doesn't directly run on that server and the request will be forwarded, the server would send the decrypted regular HTTP for the rest of the path to my application.",

I come from a rural area so I quickly gave up on searching and settled elsewhere. I worked various jobs in the last 3 years. I didn't like any of them. It seems like I just can't find my place.\n\nSometimes I think about moving to the city and working as a programmer but the reality is nobody would want to hire me. I was unhirable in 2022, and it's gotten much worse since 2022.\n\nI knew getting a degree alone was not going to be enough to hired, and I knew side projects (github portfolio) and internship were important. I knew that since like 2019 or 2020 (I was still a student) but university was super overwhelming to me. I felt burnt out during university. I had no time and energy to build a portfolio.\n\nNow I have a full time job (a job that I don't like) and I am doing a weekend university that is related to my current job so I don't have much time. I will have more time when I finish this bullshit university.\n\nBut the thing is, I just do not see myself getting hired even if I code 15-20 hours every week for a year as a hobby. The market seems so oversaturated and it seems that if you don't have a cool internship coming out of university, your career is done. Also, many people are claiming that the need for developers will decrease in the near future due to AI.",

After all there's no reason to change it now or ever.\nWon't unit tests be overkill for this?\n\nWhat about functions and classes that are simple to understand/debug/modify? Should unit tests only be done for more complex code/frequently modified code?\n\nAnd if something needs unit tests how many should I do? Should I try to cover all the edge cases? Or just the common ones that are easy to break.\n\nFinally, what scope should unit tests be? It's probably not a good idea to make unit tests for each function, but what about per class?

        "content": "So, I recently started programming again after like a year and a half of a break and I very vividly remember that every time I had a project idea that I thought was a bit too ambitious I would always put it away and I would think that it's too much for me and that I should do it some other time in the future. It wasn't until recently that I realized that that mindset can be really dumb sometimes and could even hinder your learning.\n\nNow, if you're an absolute beginner with weeks or barely 3 months of experience, then yeah start simple and work your way up. But, I'm talking about the beginners who already learned the fundamentals, those who already understand their programming language and can start making projects. Whatever it is you've been planning, just do it.\n\nBuilding projects will keep you in this loop of learning and crazy dopamine hits when you figure out how everything works. For example, right now I'm building an HTTP server with some help from a tutorial and it's something that I've always wanted to do but seemed so complex to me and now that I am doing it I feel so dumb for not starting it before because everything makes sense now, TCP packets are just a stream of bytes in order, almost no different to reading from a file and I've been reading files for months now. I would have never realized this if I had just said \"Nah, I'm not ready.\" \n\nPoint is, projects only seem impossible or difficult BEFORE you start them. When you do start them and you get through that first obstacle now the project just becomes something new but super fun. So, if you know you have the resources and the fundamental knowledge to start that one project that really interests you, just do it, don't put it off for another 3 months because you think you're not ready. You have endless learning resources, so start the project and build it by solving one problem at a time and you'll be fine.",

Like i get im supposed to make a jframe and add ui elements to it, but there's a disconnect happening between the coding concepts im learning and what im actually doing when building the app.\n\nAlso reading tons of documentation is very time consuming and migrane inducing. In the past ive built a very simple 3d simulation using opengl in C++ and while i did get praised a lot like i was some genuis by my proffessor, i dont even fully understand the rendering pipeline or what each and every function call i made does.\n\nBasically what im trying to say is: i fully understand the building blocks (ifs, loops, variables, functions, OOP concepts...) but i cant actually connect that to what im doing when making an app that actually does something.\n\nAlso when i have an idea for an program i wanna make, i find it really hard to break it down into managable subproblems and get overwhelmed.\n\nSo im stuck where i am right now and dont know how i should go about improving my problem solving skills at all.\n\nSorry for for how badly this post is written, i have a hard time putting the problems i have into words.",

C++ definitely has a large community and many existing resources. Rust has better memory management but it's still relatively new. They're very similar in terms of performance from what I've heard. I know there's no definitive answer as it's mostly a personal choice but I'd like to hear different opinions to make up my mind. \n\nSo what are your thoughts about it?\n\n",

He was explaining how he learned programming from the very small selection of books his library offered, but mostly from NEWSPAPER CUTOUTS. On top of that he was programming games in assembly!\n\nWhen it comes to problem sets, I find that I learn best without the help of ai. But I ask this question in regards to googling as well because this is something I'm very indecisive about. I'll give an example, the other day I was working on a CS50 problem set and I ended up spending too much time trying to make over complicated for loops to compare each char in an array of strings. Then, when I finally googled it, I found out there was a function in a library that did it for me. Maybe this isn't the best anecdote because I could've read the documentation on the library before hand, but I hope you get my point. I also think ai is so much more looked down upon than googling, but I think both can reinforce the same bad habits, I.e when things get difficult you end up relying on something else. \n\nI understand that it wasn't the limited resources that made John Carmack into John Carmack. However, I personally think a scarcity in resources indirectly makes you remember things better. \"Why would I need to remember the syntax differences in declaring a function in JS vs Python if the answers are a couple clicks away.\" \n\nI'm genuinely curious to hear what your opinions are on this. What would be ways to balance this? Could the complete opposite of googling everything be beneficial, i.e only picking a handful of resources and limiting yourself to that? ",

But when I checked the website, the new document was not showing. At first, I thought it was just caching, so I refreshed the page, but nothing happened. Then I tried a hard refresh, still nothing. I even cleared cookies and cache manually, but still no result. I gave up for the day.\n\nThe next day I checked Vercel to see if I had missed something, but the deployment looked fine. I even redeployed the last commit, but the new doc was still not showing. I opened the editor, ran git fetch and pull, started the dev server, and the docs were still not showing there either. I spent the whole day reading through Fumadocs and Next.js documentation, thinking I must have forgotten some step, but I found nothing. Frustrated, I gave up and went to sleep.\n\nAt midnight, just before falling asleep, my brain suddenly remembered something. In the docs folder there is a meta.json file that maps all the docs. I had completely forgotten to add the new doc there. The next morning, I updated meta.json and, of course, it started showing perfectly.\n\nI know it might not add much value, but I just wanted to share this and I find it really funny how I spent an entire day troubleshooting everything except the obvious.",

Did you follow any specific study patterns, techniques, or routines that helped you retain the knowledge long-term?\n\nFor context, I’m currently following Abdul Bari’s Udemy course.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

I’ve forgotten a lot of the basics—especially DSA—so I’m starting from scratch. The problem is, there’s just so much to cover. I want to become a machine learning engineer, so I need to work through both DSA topics like trees, heaps, stacks, and graphs, and ML topics like supervised learning, LLMs, and data analysis.\n\nThe issue is—I don’t know how to structure my preparation. How do I study and actually *remember* all this for interviews? How do I plan revisions without getting overwhelmed? I have six months to get a job, and I really want to make the most of it.",

        "content": "Over the last few years, I’ve been teaching myself programming. I’m currently 32 and I wouldn’t say I’m “good” at any specific language. During these past few years, I’ve always jumped between multiple languages (C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, etc). I have basic knowledge in the languages listed, but I wouldn’t say enough to build something worth while.\n\nI do try and stick to one language, but then I’d usually get bored, see a new shiny thing, and jump towards that. Then most of the time, I’ll do a complete 360 and return to the language I initially started with. I’ve been doing this for years and always struggled just to stick to 1 language. And it feels like I’ve shot myself in the foot by not specialising in a single language to become efficient in it. \n\nI think the reason why I struggle focusing on a single language, is (in my honest opinion) ADHD. I haven’t been officially diagnosed with it, but a few friends who have it, have said it’s a common thing to hyper focus on something, then jump to something else (they work in tech themselves). And the other reason, is that I do find all languages interesting and want to learn as much as possible (which I know isn’t ideal when starting out).\n\nI do believe that my interests change quite a lot too, which is most likely another factor. Whether that’ll be attempting to make a small game, website, desktop app, etc. I’ve found it hard just to pick one language and run with it, ignoring the rest until I’ve built up good knowledge of different algorithms, data structures, design patterns etc.\n\nAs an example, my current job, they use C#/.NET for the backend services, and now my brain wants to learn C# again. But then I’m telling myself, “what’s the point, as you’d only focus on it for a few weeks/months, then your focus will change when a new shiny thing is discovered, or you get bored.”\n\nHas anyone else done the same in the past? If so, how did you combat it? Any advice would be appreciated.",

I was hoping I could get some thoughts from people who've been where I have and pushed through it.\n\nWhen I started, the company made it clear that they expected nothing from me, which I found a bit strange and it made me feel like my work didn't matter from the start. I was given my first project and I completed it in a month, I told my supervisor this and his reaction seemed more annoyed than pleased, and he said he would have to find something else for me to do if I don't slow down. He also explained that I had completed it much quicker than they expected (~3/4 months ahead of schedule). This made me feel great at the time; looking back, I fear they were just underestimating me.\n\nI tried to take some initiative. I taught myself to write cleaner code, did some reading, tried to push the idea behind my first project further and add some extra features while I had no other projects or tasks lined up.\n\nI eventually asked my supervisor for some more work and he put me onto doing bug fixes. I was happy at the time because it was helping me learn much more about the codebase, about the products they sell and I was making a difference, but 3 months later and there still wasn't any more projects lined up. I spoke to a couple of my friends also away on internships and they seem to be busy, with multiple projects waiting and with deadlines. It hurts even more when I see other members of staff working on projects I feel I would me more than capable of assisting them with and when I offer to help, they turn me away.\n\nThere have been monthly stand-ups where they joke about forgetting I'm there, I haven't had a single code review in the 5 months and when I ask management, they say they've been very busy. This makes me feel even more demoralized because if they're busy, why can't they get me to help?\n\nAdditionally, I just feel like I don't deserve to be there and like I'm expendable. My manager constantly jokes about how stupid people from my university are and I do try and laugh it off but it keeps making me feel even worse about being there. I even recall cases where they've been annoyed about me asking for help!\n\nI've contemplated trying to leave in favour of another intenrship, but I don't think it's possible to find another at this time in the year and I can't imagine me leaving 8 months early would look good on my resume. I feel trapped and like I'm not improving at all.\n\nHave any of you been in an internship like this?\n\nI would appreciate all your thoughts and opinions on this as I'm really struggling. \n",

I’m also taking 8 courses right now, so it’s a lot to handle.\n\nI don’t just want to pass for the grade; I actually want to understand Java and enjoy learning it. I’ve tried watching YouTube tutorials, but they didn’t really help me grasp the basics or how to apply them.\n\nIf anyone has tips on how to properly learn Java as a beginner, what resources to use, or how to practice effectively, please let me know. Any advice would be really appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

It all started when I was chatting with a friend who wanted a website for his small business... I told him that everything is online and that he can do it without paying an IT company...Then I thought, why not take the challenge myself? Which I did....\n\nLong story short, I watched a YouTube tutorial, bought a domain + hosting, updated the name servers, installed WordPress, bought a ThemeForest theme, and used elementor to build him a site. Took me about a week..... He was mind-blown when I showed him the final result 🤣🤣\nJust after that, something clicked.. I actually enjoyed doing all that. So I started learning HTML and CSS on freeCodeCamp, and honestly, I’m finding it fun and kind of addictive....\n\nNow I’m wondering if I should take this seriously and maybe change careers down the road. But I need some guidance from people who’ve been there or know the field...\n\nShould I go for frontend, backend, or full stack?\n\nWhat’s the best way to learn and practice at the same time?\n\nAny must to use resources or roadmaps for someone starting fresh plz ?\n\nAny advice or feedback would be super appreciated. 🙏",

I’m struggling with caring about them the way the system expects me to.\n\nEvery time exams approach, I don’t feel scared, anxious, or even motivated. I just feel… detached. Because my goal isn’t to chase marks — it’s to understand, to learn, to build. What excites me isn’t memorizing for a grade, it’s learning cutting, learning something that actually connects with my future.\n\nBut the problem is that sometimes, the environment around you drains you before you even start. You see people studying hard to get top marks, while you’re there trying your best to understand — but there’s nothing to truly understand. You try to find meaning in what you study, but most teachers themselves aren’t motivated, and it kills your spark a little every day.\n\nLiving in Algeria doesn’t make it easier — the system feels heavy, exhausting, and uninspiring. You go to university, follow the hours, come back home drained, and even on your “rest days,” you don’t really rest. You just survive.\n\nAnd sometimes I ask myself: do students in other countries feel the same? Are they also fighting to keep their curiosity alive in a system that wants to turn everyone into the same mold?\n\nI’m not saying I hate studying. I actually love learning. I just wish learning wasn’t reduced to chasing numbers on a piece of paper.\n\nSo yeah, I’m excited to cut — to start my own path, to learn differently, to build something that feels alive. Because if the system can’t teach me what I was born to do, then I’ll teach myself.",

So let's take r/bostonceltics as a potential example.\n\nI would like to be able to tell me program to send me a notification if:\n\nThere is a new post on r/bostonceltics AND that post\n\n\\- Has the name \"Derek\" or \"Derek White\" in the title\n\n\\- Is a text post without a picture or link\n\n\\- Has 2 or fewer comments\n\n\\- Does not contain \"Brad\" or \"Brad Stevens\" in description.\n\nI would of course also like to be able to change these parameters and have multiple queries at once.\n\n  \nTo be clear, I don't want to create a bot to respond or create reddit spam--only be notified so I can then check out the post myself.\n\n\n\n**1. Is this a feasible idea in scope for a beginner to work towards?**\n\n**2. What are the likely roadblocks?**\n\n**3. What is the best programming language?**\n\nI read the subreddit FAQ and the other subreddit resources, and from what I can tell Python might be a decent choice for this, but I'd like to get some more experienced opinions before I fall down this rabbit hole.\n\nThank you so much for the help.",

        "content": "in concept art, there is a term called 'kitbashing' where people use assets to make a collage to build their project off of, whether it is using a 3d render to paint over for a 2d illustration or using kits of generalized parts such as screws or technical looking parts of machinery.\n\nThis is likely a stupid analogy, but I have viewed this to be similar to using tutorials. So far, when I am designing a program from scratch, I make a diagram where I roughly describe and draw out features, then I try to write down potential places I could find an example of the feature. usually it starts with generally describing the feature in google \"How to draw a line between two objects in godot\" for example, then I start looking up classes in the godot library I can use and watching tutorials of feature implementation that is somewhat similar.\n\nBut I often get stuck trying to then understand the code in the tutorial and studying whether the method used in the tutorial is the most efficient way for my project, or if I cannot find a tutorial that is directly relevant I struggle to try and take apart the code line by line in the documentation.\n\nBut as a programming beginner, I also don't really understand the design of a library. I may roughly understand the description of a function such as vector2 get\\_point\\_position(index:int) for example returning the position of a point, but I  may not understand the underlying design, such as how I still don't understand how a vector can have an index, or whether it's the 2d line itself  that is an array containing points.\n\n  \nInitially I thought there was some holy grail book of software architecture & programming library design that if I read, I would have a rough idea of how to outline the implementation of any project, I wouldn't awkwardly type in a rough description of my feature into google but I would rather have a label for the type of data structure and algorithm the feature uses and knew exactly where to look in the library documentation, or if developing from complete scratch.\n\nI've went through CS50, reviewed the programming fundamentals of addresses, pointers, OOP principles, intermediate programming in java implementing binary searches and linked lists etc, but my implementation skills still really suck, even after making a design diagram and pseudocode, I never know where to look in order to translate my pseudocode into a specific function in a library or a class from scratch. It feels like I am somewhat a native speaker in 'design', but I barely know my alphabet in terms of implementation.  \n\n",

My courses are completely online and asynchronous, which is great. But the resources provided are not always the greatest and expect completely green students to take in and have a full understanding of concepts that are more suited for those who have years of experience. The course is IT 315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design. I'm pretty nervous about it, as a lot of students have said it's the most difficult course they've taken throughout their studies. My understanding of programming/coding is extremely rudimentary at best, ranging from the MySpace days of editing HTML to a basic SQL class I took a few months back. That's about it. \n\nOur textbook for the course is Systems Analysis & Design: An Object-Oriented Approach with UML, 6th ed. I also just purchased a book called Head First Object Oriented Analysis & Design by Brett McLaughlin, which I have heard is great for a visual representation of the basics. Aside from actual books, does anyone have any online tutorials or videos that may be helpful for getting started here? From the very beginning of understanding the underlying concepts. The simpler, the better. I don't even know what UML is, other than that it stands for Unified Modeling Language. No idea what that means! Obviously Google will be my best friend for this class, but if anyone here has trusted resources that they've found helpful, I would definitely appreciate the guidance. TIA\n\nNote: I've already searched past threads on this and other subs for more information and resources. They weren't very helpful as most threads only had one or two replies.",

        "author": "Fwellimort",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I have over the past few years tried to help 6 CS students more directly through Discord, etc. All of whom claimed to be grinding, etc and so forth. Here has been my thoughts on what I noticed of college students and new grads.\n\nPS: I have over a dozen of students who had DMed for help, etc as well but those have always been casual reddit chats since I don't care anymore.\n\n\n\nMy thoughts on the job market:\n\n1. Job market for new grads and interns this year looks significantly better than the past 2 years.\n\n2. Offshoring is a reality which cannot be ignored. Companies are growing talent abroad now and a lot of layoffs have had their jobs moved to offshore. Unlike the past, offshore infra and talent is there. Covid 'proved' remote work works and 'offshore' == 'remote work'. Talent does not magically get better or worse depending on where the individual is located. And paying top dollar in Canada means entirely different from paying dollar in US.\n\n3. There's just too many CS majors and CS curriculums overall have become easier so schools can make more money. And there's so many CS adjacent majors sprouting left and right on top like Information Science, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational X, Computer Science + X, Information Systems, Informatics, Software Engineering, Business Information Management, etc.\n\nAnd then there's the fact a lot of Math, Physics, Statistics, Actuarial Science, etc students are minoring in CS as well. And Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, etc students all applying to CS jobs as well.\n\nThe supply of candidates is essentially infinite relative to demand for new grads.\n\n4. Resumes all look similar end of day due to Chatgpt. And honestly, what can you expect out of students. These are students, not working professionals. Truth is, the most differentiating factor is school name on a resume before any work experience.\n\n  \nThat said, at the same time, the talent and quality of new grads have significantly deteriorated. The median talent is on the floor (if there even is a floor). And a lot of them seems to be due to:\n\n1. Schools dumbing down curriculums + grade inflation (easier to graduate).\n\n2. Students doing bare minimum in school and just studying for the job interviews. Hence you see students here with 2.0 GPAs showing off the interviews they have gotten.\n\n3. CS is now really mainstream unlike in the way past in which programming was thought to be for nerds.\n\n4. Modern devices have abstracted away so much that students did not have to grow up having to deal with all sorts of bugs, frustrations, etc on the Internet.\n\n5. Chatgpt. It does homework, vibe coding, etc. Why bother spending the hours?\n\n6. There is a whole industry to min-maxing CS related job interviews. And the quality is really high as well. And a lot of information which in the past might have needed weeks of research is readily available within minutes now.\n\n7. TikTok brainwashing towards the world of instant gratifications. Students just don't want to deal with long frustrating grinds that go nowhere, etc.\n\n8. A lot of students going in claim to be 'passionate' in CS but really they are just majoring in it for the money or lifestyle they heard on TikTok, Youtube, etc. Now, I think 'passionate' is cringe but .. these students are all just really doing the bare minimum.\n\n  \n\\--------\n\nWhy am I saying this? Well.. while I do know Youtube is a bait, my direct experience with 6 CS students in this subreddit have largely been the same as the ones I found on Youtube.\n\nIn fact, I would argue the ones on Youtube look like god talent relative to most of the 6 CS students here in this subreddit I interacted on Discord.\n\nWhat Youtube videos you might ask? This is from Coding Jesus Youtube channel which is extremely baity and really there for him to advertise his own site but...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM\\_3yM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM_3yM)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s\\_ztBwg7Vls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ztBwg7Vls)\n\nLet me just say ... most of the 6 CS students in this subreddit over the years I interacted on Discord... makes those candidates look like top talent.\n\nI have come to believe that we seriously need more gatekeeping in this field. Completely agree with Coding Jesus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA)\n\n  \nOn the hiring side, most students are flat out garbage. But the problem is **student resumes despite how well done at aggregate will always look similar before actual work experience**. \n\nHence on the company side, the only way to filter is largely by school names at aggregate. And trust me when I say this, most students at \"top schools\" nowadays are flat out garbage as well. The difference being AT LEAST the students at top schools tend to be good at Leetcode. At least that bare minimum is done.\n\nThe worst part of all this is actual talent cannot be differentiated either from the rest as well. And with so much cheaters everywhere, it's just impossible to tell who is actually good from others.\n\n  \nIt has been frustrating and a huge waste of time trying to help some students here in this subreddit only to learn that they ddn't even bother to do the bare minimum. I'm sorry but if you cannot do a basic easy-medium Leetcode question and are screaming for how the world is unfair and what not claiming you have been grinding and doing everything... then you are not fit for this field. Get out.\n\nIt's been a huge waste of my time and a huge eye opening over the years how bad most CS students are lately when it comes to CS. And the best part? Every one of them at the start talked as if they thought differently of themselves.\n\n  \nBut ya.. just me rambling. Just wanted to share this. Also, good luck college students with the job market. I know it's rough. My only real advice to you is .... well, look into C++ if you are serious about software engineering and want to differentiate yourself from others. Totally agree with this recruiter as well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA)\n\n\nNote: I still am helping one of them and plan to for the next few years (been helping for two years now). But no more after that. ",

Was about a 20k bump over my current role so I decided to jump in.\n\nHere’s how it went:\n\n1.) External Lead Recruiter conversation\n2.) External Business Partner conversation (direct report of #1)\n3.) Take-home assignment via Coderbyte\n4.) Discussion with CTO, including reviewing my takehome\n5.) Live leetcoding round - 2 engineers\n6.) Live system design round - 2 engineers\n7.) Behavioral interview - 1 QA engineer, 1 implementation engineer, 1 product manager\n\nAt this point, I figured I was just about done and was about to receive an offer.\n\nNo - I then received a message about them wanting me to meet their CEO for a “quick chat” - fine. As I prepare for that, I then receive another message that they just hired a new Head of Engineering and they would like me to meet with them BEFORE the CEO.\n\nInsane, right? But the market is the market so I persevere.\n\nAs I await the meeting with the Head of Engineering today, I get a call from the recruiter informing me that there was a “miscommunication” and that they will not hire in my state, NOR the one I plan to move to in a few weeks! (Florida -> Illinois) \n\nI was completely transparent about my location/relocation, with my current location being on my resume and LinkedIn (where they found me). The fact that this was not internally discussed prior to me going through the whole process is extremely inconsiderate of my and other candidates’ time.\n\nExtremely frustrating, but hey, maybe I dodged a bullet. If they are this disorganized during interviewing, it would probably be a nightmare to work for. They are also going through a re-org, after being acquired by private equity a few weeks ago.\n\nIt sucked getting the call - especially after talking to 10 people about the role - but my interview skills now are sharper.

Those may not be included in this 30K number. \n   * For example, Amazon in India may not 'layoff' people but ask them to resign (with a severance benefit). Such RIF (cloaked as 'resignation') is not reported as a layoff. \n* Amazon is just a canary in the coalmine. Other FAANG and IT services companies are following with their own RIFs - some making headlines others not \n* Analysts are pointing at reasons like AI and Automation. While there is some of it, the real reason is global slowdown. \n   * Just look at US, the largest market where Federal government shutdown is going to hit fed-workers paychecks and foodstamps too. \n   * Consumers who don't have a job can't buy stuff - offline or on Amazon\n* Offshoring and H1 - this is a big elephant in the room. Amazon has approximately 110,000 permanent employees in India across its corporate and fulfilment centres. \n   * One can assume 20-25% of such  \"corporate employees,\" especially in IT and Business Services are in India\n   * The Yin-Yang that Trump did with H1-B announcement hasn't helped matters. As of June 2025, Amazon had approximately 10,044 employees on H-1B visas, making it the largest sponsor of this visa category in the United States. Can these H1 jobs be offshored by laying off locally and hiring in India?",

I’ve owned the whole lifecycle: idea→ design → UX/UI → development → QA → bug fixes and user support.\n\nI assumed shipping a product with real users and revenue would be a strong early-career signal. So far, though, it hasn’t seemed to move the needle in early screens for internship/student/entry-level SWE roles.\n\nFor context: GPA 88/100 (\\~3.52/4). I also built a portfolio site and a product site in Next.js (not linking here).\n\n**Now for my question:** If a shipped product like this isn’t considered strong signal, what *does* count as projects or experiences that help students stand out for early-career SWE roles? Curious what hiring teams actually treat as meaningful signals.",

I was spending my christmas holidays as CS student trying to fix CSS issues and launch my \"unique idea\" (it kind of was but I had no idea how to monetize or grow at my 22 years).\n\nA career came relatively easy in the richer northern EU countries with plenty of corporate, slow paced jobs (cruising/rest and vest) (without really vesting anything - no stocks).\n\nLooking back I probably wasted my first 5 years of work with minor skill building in CSS. I did get pretty good in CSS though.\n\nEnter JS hype circa 2015. I Suddenly realize I was a pixel pusher / HTML-CSS guy who barely understood how jQuery worked and my JS skills were close to 0. hoisting? closures? MVVM? wtf are you talking about? I can tell you whats the difference of relative/absolute positioning and the box model, but you're not really interested are you?\n\nA lack of effort in personal projects, lack of studying the proper material, and a choice of relatively comfortable jobs that did not use Angular/Backbone or React (early days) meant I stayed behind.\n\nAround 2017 I realize I need to do something. I start grinding JS problems, non stop interviewing, codewars, and other learning platforms. I get into my first full time VueJS projects after a whiteboard recursion test and a coding challenge. Only problem: I hated the role, the product, and the people. \n\nI get into two more gigs in VueJS projects for a period of a total of 6 years in Vue. And that means: I get left out of the ReactJS game. One more thing to play catchup on.\n\nI wake up on morning and realize it's been 15 years I am coding professionally. Most of the peers I've worked with are in Lead, Senior Manager, Investor (!!) roles.\n\nI'm still doing take home code challenges, leetcode live interviews - to which I suck -, and struggling to get decent Senior SE roles.\n\nI keep interviewing, and something lands on my lap: I take over the tech of a startup without engineers. NextJS, Mongo, AWS, the whole shebang.  I m getting good at harder concepts. Do a little of AWS, deployments, backend. AI is happening, this helps. But I hate the product, and I'm working for half the salary I was making before. I get a contract at a FinTech which paid double. 3 months later I'm let go because of \"reasons\".\n\nthe job market shitshow is here. The TRUMP / Putin / War / Interest Rate bullshit all are happening. I'm trying to get jobs and interview but my age is catching up on me. My eyes are more easily tired. So is my lower back.\n\nMy net worth is decent, but not one to say I can \"FIRE\". Nor do I want to.\n\nDespair is setting in.",

A highly profitable IPO looks to be in the cards in the next few years. I have gotten refresher equity over the years, such that my TC is reasonable for 13 YOE. If they were to just 2x again on IPO, I’d be looking at a healthy 8-figure payout after taxes. But of course, that is paper money and is in no way guaranteed (though my insider knowledge has me pretty bullish). \n\nThe only two major downsides are as follows: I’ve been enduring a brutal 3 hour/day 3 day/week commute with kids at home. And two, I haven’t been able to purchase all my options. Only about 2/3. The pop in valuation coincided with having kids and I just couldn’t justify buying the options at the time, nor was I quite as bullish then. I’d need 3x more than I have in liquid savings to buy out the rest of the options due to taxes, and with every valuation pop that gets harder. I lose these unexercised options if I leave (classic golden handcuffs)\n\nI recently interviewed at a smaller, but still unicorn-level startup in the same sector. Its office is only 20 minutes away and has flexible hybrid hours. The offer is to lead a team at a >25% cash bump with a ~10% drop in equity depending on how you math some of the parameters. Overall a >15% TC upgrade at current valuations. It’s a paper career upgrade, but my biggest concern is trading out favorable pre-ISO RSU paper money where I am for paper equity in an as-of-yet less successful startup.\n\nThere’s a quality of life question that’s near and dear to my heart, but if the trade ends up being multiple 7 figures a couple years from now, I’d kick myself forever. \n\nAny of you have some advice here? Would you leave some shares on the table at a slam-dunk startup for a higher risk promotion and some QoL improvements?",

Anyways, a while back (before summer started) I was searching job postings in my nearest metropolitan city. There really was only about 150 listings, and they were all majority .net and sr roles. There were of course a few other languages and experience levels sprinkled in, but not that many. Fast forward to now and I have been watching indeed for a week or so. There are now over 300 listings, and filtering by entry level and full stack, there are 30 with 2 new postings today (although filtering full stack is also including jr fe and backend solely jobs as well, but hey I’ll take it). The city is not a tech hub, so there is no FAANG positions, but I’m not sure if I’d be too interested in that anyways. But, that does bring up the point that I could luckily just be in a less competitive area or something. \n\nAnyways, it’s not record breaking or anything and you can’t really determine a trend break with two data points. However, it is pretty interesting to say the least, idk.",

So they hired me on as CTO and I was thrilled for the upgrade at the time. \n\nBut I am looking for a change of pace and want to work on new challenges in a different space altogether. I had a few interviews earlier this year and they all mentioned that they liked my resume but were worried that my actual dev skills would be diminished, as they assume because of my C-suite title that I must not be doing much actual dev work. I explained that if anything, my skills have gotten sharper, as I am still the only dev working here and have to handle the bulk of the IT issues in addition to my dev and CTO responsibilities. \n\nSo I have a few questions for you all:\n1. Would you think a CTO is not capable of proper dev work anymore?\n2. Should I be looking for Senior/Staff SWE roles or is it time to make a change to Product/Project management type of roles?\n3. Got any leads on great roles in interesting spaces?\n\n",

        "content": "Hi All! Apologies for writing another one of those posts. But I am genuinely looking from some honest career advice because I feel so lost and defeated.\n\nI graduated a year ago from a T20 university. I unfortunately graduated with 0 work experience, aside from being a TA for a few semesters. I was only a CSE major my last two years of college and I couldn't land an internship in that summer between them\n\nRecently, I had an interview for an internship position for a large company that I was able to secure through a referral. Shortly after the interview, one of the engineers on the panel told me that they want to move forward with me but that I should hold tight for the official offer letter for a couple weeks as they are amidst a hiring freeze. I felt a huge sense of relief and excitement that I was finally going to land a position after months of despair. Fast forward a month later, I get an email from the recruiter that the position is no longer being filled. Needless to say, I felt absolutely crushed.\n\nThis is especially demoralizing because I have never been this close to landing a position as I rarely get interviews. I get rejected or ghosted for pretty much every application I send out. I feel like recruiters are avoiding me like the plague. I suspect it is because they are prioritizing this year's batch of new grads for junior positions. This is making me feel like my window to get my foot in the door has closed.\n\nI have even applied to some IT, QA, and analyst positions but it seems like even those are hard to get these days, especially without certs. I have also been searching for internships but finding one that is also open to grads is extremely rare.\n\nAside from applying, I have been LeetCoding, building projects, and filling in knowledge gaps using things like The Odin Project to learn full-stack development skills. I also recently finished a volunteering gig as a \"web developer\" but all I did was help build a site using a low-code website builder.\n\nI am getting the feeling that my family is getting tired of me freeloading, and I am running out of cash. So I am now trying to reassess my options and I am hoping to get some advice/anecdotes from people on here.\n\nWay I see it, I have the following options:\n\n1. Continue on the job search grind. But until when? I am running on fumes and I am getting very depressed from doing this, with little results to show. Maybe focus on non-SWE IT and analyst roles, but again finding a truly entry-level position that doesn’t require certs or experience is pretty rare.\n2. Go get a master's degree in CS. The ROI on this one is not clear at the moment and I am already in a decent amount of student debt from undergrad. But this does reset the clock and make me eligible for an internships again, and I will work really fucking hard to secure one. However, I am worried about my prospects, since I had a so and so GPA (3.4) and no research or work experience. I am also currently broke so funding the degree will be difficult, especially without all the recent funding cuts.\n3. Apply to the military as an officer. Stable employment but I still have to get in and I hear it's challenging for those outside of the military. Besides, this is not a very appealing option due to recent events and I will most likely not be doing any software engineering.\n4. Look for a non-tech job. I know that this will challenging as other job markets are also struggling. It hurts me to think that all my hard work on my CS degree will mean nothing and it feels like once I accept a non-tech related position, my chances of making it into this industry will officially become 0. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading my post\n\nP.S. my resume can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/C3MpeyT) if anyone is curious.",

The meeting lasted barely **four minutes**.\n\nNow here’s where it gets weird:\n\n1. I couldn’t find a single solid resource about what this startup actually does or builds. Their website is just a plain landing page with almost no info.\n2. They claim to be backed by a bunch of VCs, but after checking the official portfolios of those firms, I couldn’t find *Corgi* listed anywhere except for one out of the six they mention.\n3. Their work culture looks sketchy. I saw posts where they proudly mentioned gifting mattresses to employees so they can “stay in the office 24/7.”\n\nFor a startup that floods LinkedIn with posts about hiring “engineers” (basically glorified 24/7 slaves), this entire interaction felt really off and suspicious.\n\nHas anyone else heard of or interacted with this startup? Everything about them screams red flag to me.",

The constant stress at work has drained me to the point where I feel like I have no motivation left.\n\nI’m leading a project right now, and it’s been rough. The environment is cutthroat, deadlines are unrealistic, and the infrastructure we depend on is poor. My manager is honestly quite incompetent there’s no real support or guidance. Most of the people I’m working with have been struggling too, and aside from a couple of reliable teammates, I’ve had to pick up the slack for others just to keep the project moving.\n\nI’ve been fighting to unblock issues every single day, often taking on extra work to make sure we don’t fall behind. But now we’ve hit a problem , I missed some edge cases earlier in the design, and we might need to pivot to a new design for a small part of the project just a week before launch. I fully accept my mistake, but I can’t stop worrying about how this will reflect on me. With deadlines approaching, I’m terrified this will affect my performance review or even put me on a PIP.\n\nWhat’s making it worse is the exhaustion. I’ve spent so much energy fixing things that were never really my fault in the first place, finding workarounds, reviewers nitpicking and getting alignments, and now that I’m facing my own blocker, I just don’t have the will to deal with it. It feels like I’ve been holding this project together while slowly falling apart myself.\n\nI’m not sure what to do at this point, part of me wants to keep pushing, but another part just wants to stop caring altogether. Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you handle it when you were stuck between burnout, guilt, and fear of being penalized?",

I've been spending pretty much all day every day applying or working on unpresentable projects but neither of those feel like they are doing anything. Even in the rare case I get a call or something I feel like my experience and projects aren't competitive either? I ask myself \"what do I have that puts me ahead of someone with X years of experience\" and I just have nothing at all.\n\nMy experience is kind of a lost cause, I don't have good metrics for any of them and they were pretty subpar (last few years were working with stuff that isn't really CS related but I can't remove them or else it looks like I have a massive job gap and the system will reject me instantly.\n\nI don't have any ideas for projects I should be making that are exciting or will get me a job at all? I've been making a chess engine thing this past month but it doesn't feel like a real project so in effect it was a waste of time? I don't really have any exciting stories about how I solved a problem that no other person has ever solved anything like it, because it's just implementing various algorithms other people have already made and there is no difficulty to doing that? In terms of metrics it is pretty garbage, it can only search about 10k positions per second while a \"good\" chess engine can do several million per second easily.\n\nI don't know how to make something that isn't some random toy project, currently all my side projects are games where being a toy project is part of the point and there's only 1 class project that isn't a game and it probably doesn't count either as it has nothing in the way of metrics either. I don't really have motivation to try to make a banking website or something like that, because I know it isn't real so it will never have any real purpose and companies will see it as not fulfilling its purpose so it doesn't count?

I graduated with a 2.8 GPA, no internships. I have one mobile application project focused on security and networking which was my senior capstone. I was fortunate enough to get a job as an Appian developer (low-code platform) after uni, but it is not what I want to do long-term.\n\nAs a 22 year old I am now focused and ready to get my crap together. I always enjoyed my low-level C classes and am I interested in that kind of development. My goal is to work in systems-level/embedded development for mission controls systems. I also have an interest in networking and security.\n\n\\- What learning resources do you recommend?  \n\\- What types of personal projects should I build to develop and market my skills?\n\nMy immediate goal is to get a job as a junior developer and gain experience, but my skill-set is no where near qualified right now to land something like that. I am motivated and willing to put in any time and energy needed to achieve this goal. Any and all advice is extremely appreciated. I am more than happy to connect with people and answer any additional questions. Thank you!!",

However I will be taking a significant pay cut and my husband and I have planned our finances based on the assumption that I will have my currently salary until my original plan to quit which was next year.

I have been having suicidal ideation.\n\nMy husband and I are also trying to conceive and I’m afraid the amount of stress I deal with will cause complications.\n\nI am given SO much responsibility for someone so new and I can’t take the pressure. I see a therapist and psychiatrist and have medication because I have panic attacks so often because of work, which by the way I won’t be able to take when trying to conceive.\n\nThere is a big project coming my way that’s going to be awful to do, and I feel terrible leaving it for my team members to do. I am most knowledgeable about the project so even if someone helped, I would be the one primarily responsible. \n\nI have a great relationship with them and my manager and I feel like leaving before I’ve even started on the project will burn those bridges and they will hate me. But I haven’t been able to enjoy my life in the past year.\n\n\nThe other issue is my company requires a certain amount of time in grade for retirement to be vested and to keep our whole sign on bonus.

I have gotten very few responses, just a couple of local short-term contract jobs with no PTO (got ghosted for those roles too). I'm super early in my job search, so I know it might just take time to hear back from some companies.\n\nWhen I was laid off, I was trying to conceive with my husband for a couple of months, so this was a really bad time for me to lose my job. \n\nI have 3.5 years of experience working with mostly Vue and TypeScript. I did learn React at bootcamp and have been diving back into studying it since I know it's in higher demand. The thing is, I don't think I can mentally handle the grind in this field. When I first started out, I was hungry, driven, ambitious, and excited to code. I was extremely lucky to land a job 2 months after graduating from bootcamp, and tech was a lot easier to break into. \n\nNow I'm in my 30s, I want kids, and I don't have as much motivation to hustle.\n\nAs much as I love coding, I don't love the concept of having to grind constantly when I want to focus on family building and family life. Just the process of getting through dev interviews feels insane right now. Grinding leetcode, memorizing a ton of system design questions, doing tons of projects to practice different technologies, going through several rounds of interviews, only to possibly get rejected at the last stage? And then maybe having to do it ALL over again if you get laid off a year or 2 later? \n\nI've been studying my ass off the past few weeks and it got me thinking, if I'm finding this super exhausting now with no kids, how the hell am I gonna do this again if I were to get laid off again with a toddler or 2? Yes I would of course have support from my husband, but I don't know if it's realistic for me personally to constantly be trying to hustle at work, hustle while being laid off, and be a parent to young children. \n\nI keep seeing posts from people who have been laid off multiple times in a year and the idea of having to go through the  interview process more than once in a year sounds horrible. Plus, I SUCK at leetcode. I'm a great dev, but leetcode has always been a weakness of mine.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas of where I could pivot in tech? I want to learn more about roles that don't require such stressful interview processes.  Thank you in advance.",

I'd appreciate any strategic advice, especially concerning the current job market.\nMy Current Situation\nI lead a small team as a Tech Lead/Senior Frontend Developer. The problem is, I’m the only truly experienced frontend person here. My team members, while good people, are generally junior or mid-level, and honestly, they often just want to get tasks done with minimal effort.\n * Code Quality: The code I review is frequently poor—written just to pass the ticket, not to be clean or maintainable.\n * Stagnation Fear: When I do code reviews, I often worry that I'm not just failing to grow, but actually regressing. I have no one more experienced than me in frontend to learn from, which makes me feel professionally trapped.\n * The Dilemma: My role is to mentor them (which I try to do through detailed code reviews and discussions), but constantly dealing with low-quality code makes me paranoid that I'm absorbing bad habits myself.\nThe Challenge\nI need advice on how to combat this feeling of stagnation and ensure I keep growing my skills (especially technical ones like architecture and modern patterns).\nCrucially, I have very little time outside of work for side projects or intense studying. I need strategies to develop myself during work hours within the confines of my current role and project.\nMy Questions for the Community\n * In-Job Development: What are the most effective ways for a senior/lead to force their own growth technically when surrounded by less-experienced developers, especially when time after work is scarce? (e.g., specific code review tactics, using project architecture as a growth tool, etc.)\n * Market Strategy: Given the competitive nature of the current tech job market (layoffs, high competition for senior roles):\n   * When is the right time to leave? Should I wait until I can find a role that guarantees working with better talent?\n   * How do I best position my current leadership role (leading a small team, improving code quality) for interviews at top-tier companies that value deep technical expertise?\n * Mindset: How do you mentally cope with being the \"only source of truth\" and avoid the burnout/frustration that comes from constantly correcting fundamental issues?\nThanks in advance for any insights on maintaining momentum and making a strategic career move!\n",

        "content": "*Edit - Please Read!!*\n\nI'm sure grateful to all of you who took the time to speak with me about this, but guys, please, enough advice about my brother lol.\n\nI know it's a huge post and the lead gets a bit buried, but I need advice on how people value software services and how our industry tends to monitize services of this sort. It's so I can understand what things are proper for someone in my position to ask and what things I should give him. I don't just want us both to \"feel\" like we are being fair to each other, I need ways to go about valuing this stuff so we can both be comfortable with the deal we make lol.\n\n I don't need advice about going into business with my bro cuz both of us would just give the other what they want rather than let them believe they were getting screwed over. We are both much more likely to give too much away to avoid an issue than do the opposite. So having a way to put a value on this stuff and compare it to how businesses usually handle stuff like this would go a long way to ensuring we are both happy with the deal t years down the road.\n\n*Edit end*\n\nBefore I explain what's going on let me start by saying my brother is probably the least greedy, most trustworthy person on this planet. So I'm not worried that he'll try to screw me over, its that I don't have any idea what would be a fair way to charge for something of this nature since it'll basically be entirely my creation from the ground up that is using the data he is supplying. So general advice on books to read or websites to go for advice on the best practices for deciding the monetary value of certain work or current industry practices for different types of work would also be welcome.\n\n# So here's what's happening:\n\nMy brother has an idea for a service he wants to offer to the clients in his day job. Basically its a really confusing field and he wants to charge subscription access to his clients for a website that basically presents all this data for the client in plain English. This is a big deal because there are TONS of these JSON collections of rules and trust me, trying to figure it out from badly named JSON files with confusingly named key : value pairs is insanity. Presumably this info must have existed at one point, but that's kind of the thing: the whole system is so big and convoluted and there's no easily accessible source of info about it.\n\nThe reason he contacted me is cuz he wants a program that can take these complicated collections of rules and make sense of them then put them on the internet somewhere so people can access a plain English description of the interactions and uses of them. \n\n# What's the issue?\n\nThe issue is that I have a crazy amount of extremely varied experience I have that is allowing me to work on this solo and make something that will actually be a decent software. I've been so interested in data science and ML that I went back for my second bachelor's degree because of it I was certified in TensorFlow years ago, and have been using ChatGPT since before it was the the all-accessible great-god-genie that it is today. You used to have to apply for it by submitting how you planned to use it back when it was still in its infant stages.\n\nAnyway its a ton of school,, internship, job, and hobby work that I've done that's put me in a position where I know I can solo build this entire thing for sure.  I've already created a model that \"seems\" to be able to pull this off. (I have no idea if its correct cuz its not my field, but my bro says the ones I showed him appear to be mostly correct. Obviously its gonna take a good bit of fine tuning, but I'm not worried in the least that this is going to work out.)\n\nSo basically I'm going to be 100% making all the decisions of how to design and code and use the models, code and organize all the data collection and storage on the backend, and code all the website design, and do the hosting, testing, CI/CD etc. Every bit of the software that powers this whole endeavor is going to be made by me.\n\n# So what the F'ing F  is fair for me to ask for as compensation?\n\nI don't like the idea of just charging an hourly wage and having to give up something that is all my work. But also I have no intentions or desire to screw my brother on this either. I'm only getting this opportunity cuz he knows me and has the insight to know this is something that his clients would be very happy to have.\n\nAlso the amount of hours I'll put in is not equal to the amount of work that I'm  getting done. A lot of the work is going to be done in the background as my software goes through all this data and creates useful output that's then organized in a way that it can all be dumped in a database and easily retrieved through a site made with Django.\n\nOh and there's multiple clients each with their own sets of rules and things so finding a way to make my database schema universal (or as close to universal as possible) between clients is going to go a long way to prevent me from having to hardcode all of these for each client by hand. \n\nThe idea is if he picks up another client, we can just dump the data to my system and it will parse it, decode it, and add it all to the database (and through the magic of Django, create a whole bunch of webpages using that data that don't have to be coded by hand).\n\nSo please, if you have experience working on anything like this or working for a company deciding what to charge clients or know any ways I could learn about that I could really use the info.\n\nI've always worked for someone else at an hourly wage, so I have no idea how what to do otherwise. I just don't feel like being paid an hourly wage to work on this is fair. And I'd have no idea how to even figure out how much of a percentage to ask for if I want to split the profits from the subscription sales.",

Just sharing my thoughts and if anyone has anything to offer it is welcomed.  \n  \nWorking with Java, total experience now is 4+ years.  \n  \nShort version:\n\n* Changed role accepting a pay reduction of 7% in new company.\n* 5 months in I got a 2,27% raise.\n* I got my MSc in CS.\n* 1year+2months later I accepted to talk about a role in new company just to get an assessment of what could my value be in the marketplace.\n* Without even trying hard I got an offer that comes with an increase in seniority and 25% in compensation.\n* It is too good to pass but I am feeling bad about leaving my team, it is not their fault.  \n\n  \nLonger version:\n\n* I quit last July due to conflicts with new tech lead manager in team. I didn't want to be a bad employee so I left. He didn't even care. \n* Got an offer in 2 weeks for a total of 7% less yearly compensation of my previous role and NOTE for a fintech company.\n* I was expecting a 2-times per year salary re-negotiation but policy changed.\n* I got a 2,26% salary increase last January.\n* I was promised a better raise this year.\n* I worked my ass off to evolve more. Almost finished my MSc in CS.\n* I accepted to talk about a new offer ONCE and without even trying they accessed my skill was worth a 25% increase in salary and a seniority role - I get to mentor entry/juniors.\n* It is 100% better choice for me to leave, but feeling remorse cause my current team which are great people will get destroyed.\n\n  \nSome more notes for the company:\n\n1. Year closed with 50% profit increase.\n2. New offices in new city\n3. New AI team and hired like 20 ( I am assuming expensive ) AI engineers over they year.\n4. Developer left team in January, I got his workload - no salary increase, never got a replacement.\n5. Team got 3 new projects in September.\n6. Core developer was owed 200 hours of overtime and eventually instead of paying they gave him a 4 day work week for the next few months..... SAD?\n\nSUMMARY;   \nΤo me it feels like in this company my worth is less and it gets depicted in salary.   \nCompany will try to match offer only because they are in dire position.  I don't think this much of a raise would be ever considered.  \nThis means they don't value me as they should or my worth is less here and I will be better of switching anyway.  \nThe new company is purely software development oriented vs current FINTECH.",

A little background is I was enlisted for 6 years, got my bachelors in business then transitioned out into a BDR role. That company was a mess but I was recruited via linkedin to do back-end work for our sales team at a data center.   \n  \nFirst year was great! Networked well and learned a lot, then our teams got split into specific roles for different tasks. During this time I was asking heavily for SOP's since we already didn't have many and our scope of work was actually still expanding since data centers are booming with AI. Was promised some but never happened.\n\nGot a new manager that's been there for years and shes buddy buddy with our boss. Thought I was doing great, been on the team for almost a year and started showing a lot of improvement in July until now. 1 on 1s were shorter. Got some feedback on things I needed to correct but it was happening less and less. Out of the blue I get hit with this PIP last week. Still dont have SOP's but told im making too many mistakes. I currently have the second most cases managed but told my \"numbers are low\". No proof of the numbers and no verified measure of success for our team.   \n  \nHR asks me not to record the PIP but I did on my phone for my defense. I show all the improvement and the fact I do just as much as everyone else (its really not that intensive of a job we only get a few cases a week and I try to grab my fair share). But even with all my proof and documentation, the 8 mistakes I've made in the last few months apparently warrant a PIP (same mistakes my team members have and STILL are making currently). Manager is now OOO but pip gives vague KPI's which amount to \"make less mistakes and do more work\". No numbers no percentages just \"do better\".\n\nI know holidays are a terrible time to job search and I feel like linkedin doesn't even work anymore. I'm really nervous for what I'm going to do here. Any advice is appreciated.\n\n\\[Side note\\]  \n\\- I'm the only guy on my team  \n\\- I've documented a lot of the short comings of other teams and our systems (Ex: SOP's not having been updated since 2023, multi day delays in replies)  \n\\- Old manager says somebody on their team got hired that they want to throw out but they cant and his bosses boss came down on everyone hard about being able to get rid of people. Timelines line up on when I started getting monitored super closely so might have something to do with it.",

Web dev has been fine, but it’s not what I was really hoping to do long-term.\n\nRecently, my company’s been dipping its toes into AI, mostly by giving non-technical employees access to tools like ChatGPT and running some basic “AI productivity” workshops. I figured that was about as far as they’d go, but the other day I overheard my manager and a director talking about getting some NVIDIA “AI-ready” PCs to run local LLMs. My manager said it could get pricey and that we don’t really have anyone who could handle that right now.\n\nThat kinda caught my attention, because, well, I *could* help with that. I’m not a pro ML engineer, but I’ve built models, done projects, and studied this stuff a lot. I’d love to contribute if they actually start working on AI internally.\n\nThe only thing is, I’m still on a **6-month trial contract**, so I don’t want to come across like I’m bored or unhappy with my current job. I just don’t want to miss a chance to get involved if this becomes a thing.\n\nSo what’s the best way to bring this up to my manager without sounding like I’m trying to ditch my role?

        "content": "I've been working at my company for almost 10 years, and I'm a senior in a role that's a mix of Product Owner and Developer. The thing is, my seniority in this role is more due to my time working in support and consulting, where I worked for 6 years with the product before moving to my current position. I only started programming about 3 years ago, without a degree in the field, and dividing my time with the PO part of the job.\n\nI wanted to experience a full-time developer position in a larger scope than my current one, and I started sending out resumes for internal positions. Incredibly, I got an offer for a senior developer position for a completely different product within the same company, in an industry I have zero knowledge of. I applied for other mid-level positions, but this was the first one I received an offer for.\n\nThe selection process was easy and quick, and I think the people didn't realize that my actual developer experience is quite short. I think they saw I had a senior tier and skipped technical questions about the stack and previous technical experiences, focusing instead on behavior and logic.\n\nI know it will sound like imposter syndrome, but sometimes it's not just a syndrome, right? I'm terrified of accepting the position and ending up fired if I can't deliver what they ask for in the first few months. Financially, I should receive about a 30% increase if I accept.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation or knows of stories of similar situations? I usually learn quickly, but I know that seniority in development isn't earned overnight. I'm even considering scheduling a meeting with the manager to explain the situation and try to align expectations, possibly reducing the seniority/salary initially to reduce the risk of dismissal, but I know that might seem like a red flag to the manager. My company had layoffs this year, and this new team's department recently suffered one.\n\nThanks everyone! Sorry for the long text.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "One of my first tasks ever was creating a script that moves folders around when a column of data (let's say C) changes. The manager who gave me the job told me that there was a rule that won't ever be broken at our company. That is column C will always be set to A or B and that we can use that logic to determine where to move folders to. Like an idiot I checked exactly A or B and didn't have any other checks. My manager was let go somewhere down the line and I completely forgot about this script. \n\n\nNot too long ago an office worker complained that they cannot find some of our files from their PC but they can through our site. So it turns out when you set column C to something other than A or B all of our projects that rely on the data still work (because I add a unique identifier file in each that we use to search instead of path thankfully) but internal office workers can't see it directly anymore because they were moved. Someone in leadership made the decision to expand the options for column C. Without my manager here to identify that went against the systems he had us design, they just went with it. \n\n\nSo what happens is if a row of data has certain settings and column C is changed to something other than A or B, an automation triggers the script that moves ALL related folders to an unrelated folder (that is not always the same as the last record). One instance was like 10 folders but another was like 10,000 folders. I.T. was able to move things back fairly quickly because we keep a history of movement but one guy was really mad because he thought one of the developers deleted some of our stuff. Dude was essentially yelling at me already when we didn't even fully know the cause yet. I at first didn't think it was related to us but after doing my research and finding the script, I realized it was me specifically so he was kind of right. I told them and fixed it of course. \n\nHow bad is this? I feel pretty bad because checking just A or B and not having a specific fallback and other checks to make is pretty egregious. I also am not a fan of getting yelled at. I also don't like the idea of defending myself by telling them to wait until we know for sure, and then confirming they were partially right. I should be sleeping right now to drive to work tomorrow but I can't sleep because I'm so bummed.",

Some of these definitely annoyed or upset me on the day, but I don’t think about them on a regular basis. The point is— should I have been upset or annoyed at all?\n\nThere’s been a few instances over the past 5 years where I stayed up at night thinking of people’s actions and comments. I feel like nearly all of the comments and actions were justified, so I think I’m just too emotional and sensitive. I shared some of these with friends, and they all say I’m not being too sensitive, but I also almost never hear them complaining about anything like this (their complaints are usually of the shape “my managers putting me on a dead end project” or “my manager is not acknowledging my contributions”)\n\nCurious how people would react in any of the circumstances:\n\n* When I was a junior with 2 yoe, I wrote a cl and sent it to someone I’ve been working with, and he scheduled a 1:1 to talk about it. During the meeting, he gave some helpful (but maybe controversial? My tl didn’t agree with the final shape of the cl) advice, but at the same time he was laughing at my code and asking why I did this, and that Im surely smarter than him because I graduated from Caltech. I think I didn’t have a good reason beside it made sense to me. \n\n\n* I switched companies after just over 2.5 years. After about 10 months , my manager told me that my growth trajectory isn’t as good as <new grad who started 3 month after me>, and that I’d benefit from more local mentorship (the brain of the project is in hongkong, as was my manager. I’m based in the us)\n\n\n* A manager some levels above me mentioned that he’d rather work with smart assholes than people who are nice but slightly incompetent. (Though to be clear, we’re not hiring either)\n\n\n* My manager is also an IC (he only manages me), and he was the main reviewer for a cl I worked on. Another coworker left a comment and I tried to talk to my manager about these comments first. He cut me off both times. The first time was me saying oh “triggers are a good idea”, and he replied. “Yeah yeah, I saw his comment”. The second time was “are you available at 2:30? I…” “I have a meeting then”. I ask dumb questions so it’s pretty normal to get cut off, but what really annoyed me was securing our 1:1 the next day, he ask what triggers are.\n(I told this interaction to another younger coworker, and his response was I shouldn’t be emotional at work and that I should talk to my manager, which I did do weeks ago.)\n",

I think I need to seriously improve on my core CS skills, but also programming skills, probably by going deep on some specific stack or framework.\n\nBut man, I have *no clue* where to begin. It feels as if there is an ocean of things that I need to learn before I can even be considered as a serious junior candidate. I dont even know where to begin. I'm currently learning more about infrastructure (self-hosting really) by developing some fairly basic LLM wrappers to make job searching and application easier, and so I'm learning about hosting apps via Docker on remote servers, as well as setting up proper CI/CD pipelines. But even then, this is a miniscule thing and—I dont think—of any interest to any employers. There's also the AI BS, making it feel mega inefficient to do anything by hand (and actually trying to learn), as opposed to just vibing some slop out.\n\nI dont know, what do I even do? I'm thinking of doing my masters in CS come next year if I cant find anything, but I dont really have any particular interest in CS research and it would just amount to kicking the can down the road. I'm also fine like really doubling down on trying to improve core CS skills if that is what's missing to get a job, but I dont think an employer gives a damn about me knowing my DS&As.\n\nWhat do I do?",

Though I still enjoy writing software, the specifics of my position have grown stale and I am also a bit burned out on Java which I never really liked that much.  I am in my mid fifties and I am considering quitting. I am single and probably have enough money to retire under most scenarios, but I really can't see myself doing nothing.  I'd love to find something writing C/C++ for, say, 25 or 30ish hours per week.  I'm wondering what my chances are of finding piece meal or contract work writing or maintaining C/C++.  Would my age hurt me?  Is there even demand for that?  What do you think?",

But sometimes it’s really hard to follow their point. They speak so much that I either lose the main idea or miss what they’re actually trying to say.\n\nSometimes I wonder if they’re intentionally softening their message by wrapping it in a lot of words, or if it just comes naturally to them. Either way, it makes it difficult for me to respond or take action based on what they say.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that when others speak on the same topic, I understand them right away. But with these colleagues, even though they seem to cover everything, I still can’t tell what the key takeaway is.\n\nDoes anyone else ever feel the same way?",

The feedback was that it was super close, but there where concerns because I was not often enough in the office - fair enough, I have a long commute and mostly work with teams in other cities so there is not much value in being there.  But be more there, and the next position is yours. So I did just that. Was there the whole last year, at least once a week. \n\nWell the next round was this week.

Unfortunately, the market started to crash around that time, and like many of my batchmates, I couldn’t get an internship.\n\nI graduated in December 2024 and have been applying non-stop since then. To stay in the U.S., I’ve been volunteering as a web developer for an NGO, just trying to stay active and useful. I’ve sent out hundreds of applications and only got one interview with Amazon but I didn’t make it.\n\nMy OPT runs out in February, and I’m scared I might have to go back. The job market in India isn’t great either, and it makes me feel like I’m failing in every direction. I’ve been doing LeetCode, system design, and LLD every day to stay sharp, but every rejection or silence hits harder than the last.\n\nHonestly, I’ve been feeling so depressed and hopeless lately. Some days I genuinely feel like I don’t want to exist anymore. I’m trying to stay strong and keep applying, but it’s hard to fight the loneliness and fear that all this effort might go to waste.\n\nI don’t really have anyone to talk to about this, so I just needed to vent somewhere. If anyone has advice, referrals, or even just words of encouragement, I’d be really grateful.",

        "content": "If I can get a little sentimental first, I can still remember my very first program I ever wrote and turned in to some kind of final project. It was a HEAVILY pixelated Batman Logo drawn painstakingly with Apple Basic on a bulky monochrome Apple IIe. I can also remember the first time I dived into, learned and modified to my own needs source code from someone else, Oregon Trail also on that same Apple IIe model (though sometimes I'd be lucky enough to get one with the RGB monitors for the glorious 4 bit palette).\n\n  \nOver 35 years and a rich career later I've never lost the thrill and excitement of those moments. Until my latest project.\n\n  \nI play with all kinds of stuff on my free time from Arduino contraptions, to writing super niche tools for just me and my family. In my work I've mostly made the kind of software that would be considered tooling and in the majority of cases the automation processes using said tooling. \n\n  \nI've always hated the limelight, just knowing 10's to 100's of thousands of other employees were able to work more efficiently because of me has always been what drives me, that and the confidence in decades of designing highly resilient, and easily used tools and processes that only ever broke when infrastructure out of my control and foresight were changed. As part of that I've embraced the negative part of that. I'm constantly compared to my fellow engineers that appear to be out producing me by a wide margin, but most of that is the weekly if not daily need to fix their code that has been so Frankensteined from years of new and forgotten and no longer needed edge cases they have a mini existential crisis whenever they actually have to dive deeper than surface level of their own creations. Meanwhile my code sits under hundreds to thousands of daily critical automation processes for years, unseen, only needing to be touched when a new feature is needed, and then they slip back into the darkness forgotten again.   \n  \nMean while management scoffs or just handwaves any talk of any kind of style guidelines, use of any kind of shared code repositories, naming conventions, etc.   \n  \nI was pulled out of my comfortable obscurity probably 9 months ago to rewrite a daily reminder app across the corporation (I work for a global company from Australia to India, to the US, to the UK and other nations) to enter time for the day. The current app is so clearly late 90's design everything is some kind of color gradient with excessive drop shadow, 15 different colors for hover, click, unclick, disabled, ... rounded corners galore, and planted firmly in the Windows OS on maybe .NET 3.5 era drag and drop WinForms. Under the hood things were kept updated through the end of the now antiquated .NET Framework along with the massively bloated libraries of which less than 5% was actually used. Just about everything in the app was hand rolled from its scheduling to its notification UI.\n\n  \nFor months we asked what we call our \"User Experience Team\" for a design and got nothing. Finally my management just said here are the requirements\n\n* Has to have the same basic functionality as the original\n* Should run cross platform, and cross device\n* Should be as accessible as possible for all the potential users of a global company\n\nSo over the course of 3 months I worked at not just writing the new app but in most cases having to learn entirely new API while using them for the first time, and having to do it on 3 or 4 different operating system ecosystems. Plus having to update my 10 year old knowledge of C# up to the current .NET Core, as well as the insane changes to the tooling in Visual Studio since the last time I developed something for production. The fact I have lived in the terminal for so long definitely made the jump back to UI a jarring one, probably spent more time fighting to understand new tooling than actually writing code.\n\nIn the end I had an app that had \n\n* full localization with over 80 supported languages (the current app has hard coded English text)\n* accessibility all the way up to screen readers in Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS \n* native OS specific support and use of\n   * Themes (Dark/Light)\n   * Notifications\n* clean minimalistic modern design\n   * black and white with pops of color for attention\n* JSON settings (the current app still uses INI files)\n* tiny UX QoL additions\n   * choosing screen position of settings screen\n   * saving user preferences \n\nThen finally we got a response from the UET and they wanted to change just about everything. I had been warned to be fair about their extreme views on how things are supposed to look from a corporate perspective and I've dealt with plenty of that before. I had already pulled the SVG files of our corporate logo from the official media resource site to be prepared. All of my past experiences seemed like walks in the park compared to this.\n\nFirst they came back with a UI design up to its eyeballs in late 90's UI design they had a 45 page PowerPoint outlining every color for buttons, shadows, outlines, etc. Half of which were just impossible to do with the cross platform limitations of the native OS notification APIs, and UI elements. \n\nThat launched us into almost 4 months of fighting with them that we want to leverage the same native OS Notification system that just about every other enterprise app from Teams to Crowdstrike, to Intune, to Email uses instead of hand rolling not just the notification UI but the entire underlying system to schedule and display said notification. Both to alleviate us of the burden of maintaining that and to condition our users to expect their notifications from any apps in the future in the same place.\n\nJust on the windows size we went through\n\n* we want bigger button icons\n   * they are fixed at 16 x 16\n* we want incredibly detailed button icons\n   * again fixed 16 x 16 pixels\n* We want text under the buttons\n   * Despite the icons being incredibly well recognized ones like \n      * a simplified globe for a website\n      * a X to dismiss\n      * a Gear for settings\n   * despite the fact the buttons ALL had tooltips\n      * And tooltips tied into the screen reader function\n\nSo many times we'd have hour long meetings where I would outline in detail that these notification systems are deliberately simplistic and what our boundaries were and they'd send me a new design which would ignore 80% of what I said.\n\n  \nMeanwhile my direct manager started making me do things like spend weeks designing our own notification UI \"just in case they won't let us use the OS level notifications\".  or just outright abandoning things in the app because they \"just wanted to get this done\"\n\n  \nI really should have clued in earlier than I did. I lost track of the number of times my own manger would just casually throw out well why don't we drop the localization if this is going to be a problem, Reminder we are a global company that supposedly prides itself in our diverse work force and what to me should be non negotiables in that case (localization and accessibility) are just an impatient impulse away from being scrapped.\n\n  \nI had to compromise on the text on the buttons loosing some of the accessibility with the screen readers (sorry to the visually impaired) and sorry to the more verbose languages which caused uncontrollable text wrapping within the width limits of the buttons (Which was not an issue with the tool tips) but in the end I was able to get them to accept the benefits of leveraging the native notifications.\n\n  \nThen we moved on to the settings app and I was told multiple times by my manager \"I don't know why you are fighting so hard for things in this you already got them to agree to use the native notifications that should be good enough.\" Meanwhile I'm trying to explain to a bunch of glorified graphic designers how everything from their browsers to things like Word and Paint all use mainly icons with tool tips so differences in string lengths of different languages don't drastically change the layout and that our settings app should be the same simple \"icons\" from SVG data that could be colored easily for theme switching and maintain a simple consistent look and size regardless of the users native language.\n\n  \nWe went through a huge back and forth on the screen position tool on how it looks, we had pretty much settled on some changes and were having a little back and forth on some of the color choices when my manager pulls me in to a chat that Friday and basically tells me well maybe we think about dropping that feature since they are fighting over it. I tell him we've pretty much reached a consensus. So he tells me ok you and I will talk about it on Monday before the meeting.\n\n  \nNot 5 minutes later he posts in the group chat with the UET \"If you want we can just get right of the screen position tool.\" and almost immediately they were like \"ok so here's a new UI design since you are offering\" Clearly they had it waiting in the wings. The best part besides being thrown under the bus by my manager was their new design was another radical layout change from the previous layout we had painstakingly agreed on all leading up to them wanting this to be displayed in a looming corporate wide event. So now I'm stuck with even more UI design change and code that already looks like Swiss cheese because they can't even stay consistent in what they want it to look like or behave like.\n\n  \nAfter pointing out to the group chat that trying to hit these constantly moving and arbitrary changes was exhausting my manager scheduled a one on one with me and his manager where I was told \"You have to stop taking this so personally\" I tried to explain to them that insisting on basic features like supporting our end users native languages, our end users disabilities, and opting for the vanilla flavored APIs whenever possible is not taking it personal but the bare minimum I should be shooting for when designing software for a company that touts the kind of mission statement most do. That was met with a bunch of hand wavy \"Well you just don't know all the stuff that goes into maintaining a corporate image and things like that.\" \n\n I told my manager point blank that he stabbed me in the back. You always know the feel good stuff most companies put in their mission statements or creeds are BS but I've never experienced just how expendable they really are than in this project. Trying to square the circle of my manager for 15 minutes telling how they worked with this one guy who had a visual impairment that he could not see black and white and being told a dozen or more times to scorch the ability of 10's of thousands of employees to have the app in their language or read to them all to placate a group obsessed with design over function.\n\nSo that brings us to right now where I'm wrapping up the latest round of almost complete UI rework hoping this time its enough for me to be done with this. I don't quit when I've set off to create something but this has shattered something inside. I'm no stranger to throwing things out. I love an elegant solution but will be the first to throw it out when a proven superior one comes along. Usually I can find immense joy in just the process of learning new things and the challenges with designing something robust and useable for as wide an audience as possible despite the input from other less technical stake holders. Something about spending so long being dictated by a group of people that not only are 25 years out of date with their idea of UI design but actively ignores any knowledge of modern UI design, while my management is just trying to shove things through with about as much foresight as a frat party hookup has me so frustrated I'm starting to hate the idea of coding for work. \n\nI jump to some of my backend stuff and I'm back in that joy state, pop the hood on a tool my co worker discovered a feature need to both update and take the opportunity to teach him somethings about designing resilient tools and I'm all into that joy and elation. I work on something with my son on one of the Arduino projects and I'm feeling the joy especially watching him get excited when he makes something happen. I come back to THIS project and it's all I can do to force myself to slog through yet another massive change while I'm being hounded to hurry up.\n\nI do hope when I'm finally done with this project I can slip back into the shadows and get back to my only work love: the code. Though now when my manager asks me things like how my weekend was all I can think is why are you even asking me? or how my family is and all I can do is choke down what I really want to say and respond with a \"yes, what can I do for you.\" \n\nI know a lot of this is my fault I have the bad habit of getting comfortable and let a lot of things slide on an interpersonal side when I'm working on something I love, I have never had a problem being professional and working with people that I do not personally get a long with, but I can't just put the knowledge you actively tried to sabotage me away because you want me to believe you care with your platitudes.\n\nIf it wasn't for the fact this job was helping me pay for my children's school tuition I would most likely be less stressed to kowtow to people who don't value what I do. \n\n\n\nI'm seriously considering taking my mornings before this job and taking a volunteer position teaching the high schoolers at my kids private school some programming courses. They are have been some subtle and not so subtle requests from some of the staff and teachers for me to maybe jump in. I have always loved teaching others and I have in the corporate world a really good track record of teach people that went on to high level jobs from the skills I was able to foster in them. Maybe the joy of seeing the lights go on and the excitement of creation in the faces of tomorrows potential engineers and developers will be enough to keep the spark alive in the darkness of all I'm paid to endure.
