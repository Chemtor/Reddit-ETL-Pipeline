        "content": "Hey¬†r/dataengineering ¬†üëã\n\nI‚Äôve spent most of my career working with databases, and one thing that‚Äôs always bugged me is how hard it is for AI agents to work with them. Whenever I ask Claude or GPT about my data, it either invents schemas or hallucinates details. To fix that, I built¬†[ToolFront](https://docs.toolfront.ai/). It's a free and open-source Python library for creating lightweight but powerful retrieval agents, giving them a safe, smart way to actually understand and query your database schemas.\n\n# So, how does it work?\n\nToolFront equips your agents with 2 read-only database tools that help them explore your data and quickly find answers to your questions. You can either use the built-in MCP server, or create your own custom retrieval tools.\n\n# Connects to¬†everything\n\n* 15+ databases and warehouses, including: Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL & more!\n* Data files like CSVs, Parquets, JSONs, and even Excel files.\n* Any¬†API with an OpenAPI/Swagger spec (e.g. GitHub, Stripe, Discord, and even¬†internal APIs)\n\n# Why you'll love it\n\n* **Zero configuration:**¬†Skip config files and infrastructure setup. ToolFront works out of the box with all your data and models.\n* **Predictable results**: Data is messy. ToolFront returns structured, type-safe responses that match exactly what you want e.g.\n   * `answer: list[int] = db.ask(...)`\n* **Use it anywhere**: Avoid migrations. Run ToolFront directly, as an MCP server, or build custom tools for your favorite AI framework.\n\nIf you‚Äôre building AI agents for databases (or APIs!), I really think ToolFront could make your life easier. Your feedback last time was incredibly helpful for improving the project. Please keep it coming!\n\n**Docs:**¬†[https://docs.toolfront.ai/](https://docs.toolfront.ai/)\n\n**GitHub Repo**:¬†[https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)\n\nA ‚≠ê on GitHub really helps with visibility!",

This is costing a fortune. \n\nSolutions thought of:\n- Pre aggregation: great in thought, unfortunately too many possibilities to pre calculate \n\n- Onelake: Microsoft of course suggested this to our leadership, and though this does enable fitting the data ‚Äòin memory‚Äô, it would be expensive as well, and I personally don‚Äôt think power bi is designed for drill downs\n\n- Clickhouse: this seems like it might be better designed for the task at hand, and can still be integrated into power bi. Columnar, with some heavy optimizations. Open source is a plus. \n\nAlso considered: Druid, SSAS (concerned about long term support plus other things)\n\nIm not sure if I‚Äôm falling for marketing with Clickhouse or if it really would make the most sense here. What am I missing? \n\nEDIT: i appreciate the thoughts this far. The theme of responses has been to pushback or change process. I‚Äôm not saying that won‚Äôt end up being the answer, but I would like to have all my ducks in a row and understand all the technical options before I go forward to leadership on this. ",

I work with healthcare/health insurance data and mainly use SQL and Tableau.\n\n I am one of those people who transitioned to DA from science. The majority of what I know was self taught. In my previous job I worked as a researcher but I taught myself python and wrote a lot of pandas code in that role. The size of the data my old lab worked with was small but with the small amount of data I had access to I was able to build some simple python dashboards and automate processes for the lab. I also spent a lot of time in that job learning SQL on the side. The python and SQL experience from my previous job allowed me to transition to my current job. \n\nI have been in my current job for two years. I am starting to think about the next step. The problem I am having is when I search for DA jobs in my area that fit my experience, I don't see a lot of jobs that offer salaries better than what I currently make. I do see analyst jobs with better salaries that want a lot of ML or DE experience. If I stay at my current job, the next jobs up the ladder are less technical roles. They are more like management/project management type roles. Who knows when those positions will ever open up. \n\nI feel like the next step might be to specialize in DE but that will require a lot of self learning on my part. And *unlike* my previous job where I was able to teach myself python and implement it on the job, therefore having experience I could put on job applications, there aren't the same opportunities here. Or at least, I don't see how I can make those opportunities. Our data isn't in the cloud. We have a contracting company who handles the backend of our DB. We don't have a DE like team in house. I don't have access to a lot of modern DE tools at work. I can't even install them on my work PC. \n\nA lot of the work would have to be done at home, during my free time, in the form of personal projects. I wonder, are personal projects enough nowadays? Or do you need job experience to be competitive for DE jobs? ",

I‚Äôve been working on this project on-and-off for a while, and I thought I would see what¬†[r/DE](https://www.reddit.com/r/DE/)¬†thinks.\n\nThe basics of the pipeline are as follows, orchestrated with Airflow:\n\n1. Download and extract bill data from¬†[Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/)¬†bulk data page, unzip it in my local environment (Google Compute VM in prod) and concatenate into a few files for easier upload to GCS. Obviously not scalable for bigger data, but seems to work OK here\n2. Extract url of voting results listed in each bill record, download voting results from url, convert from xml to json and upload to GCS\n3. In parallel, extract member data from¬†[Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/)¬†API, concatenate, upload to GCS\n4. Create external tables with airflow operator then staging and dim/fact tables with dbt\n5. Finally, export aggregated views (gold layer if you will) to a schema that feeds a Streamlit app.\n\nA few observations / questions that came to mind:\n\n\\- To create an external table in BigQuery for each data type, I have to define a consistent schema for each type. This was somewhat of a trial-and-error process to understand how to organize the schema in a way that worked for all records. Not to mention instances when incoming data had a slightly different schema than the existing data. Is there a way that I could have improved this process?\n\n\\- In general, is my DAG too bloated? Would it be best practice to separate my different data sources (members, bills, votes) into different DAGs?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/153iiz683llf1.png?width=2158&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e735c54db6bf536fa52d7f8e4fa246feb62f7b\n\n\\- I probably over-engineered aspects of this project. For example, I‚Äôm not sure I need an IaC tool. I also could have likely skipped the external tables and gone straight to a staging table for each data type. The Streamlit app is definitely high latency, but seems to work OK once the data is loaded. Probably not the best for this use case, but I wanted to practice Streamlit because it‚Äôs applicable to my day job.\n\nThank you if you‚Äôve made it this far. There are definitely lots of other minor things that I could ask about, but I‚Äôve tried to keep it to the biggest point in this post. I appreciate any feedback!",

I often end up finding that there needs to be a lot of additional work done on top of source data, such as joining tables together, building out incremental models on top of the source data, filtering out bad data, etc. It's still ultimately viewing the source data, but can have significantly more logic than just the raw layer.\n3. Catalog (Silver): Datasets people are going to use. These are not always just whatever is from the source data, it can start to be things like joining different data sources together to create more complex stuff, but they are generally not report specific (you can create whatever reports off of them).\n4. Reporting (Gold): Datasets that are more report specific. This is usually something like aggregated, unioned, denormalized datasets.\n\nOverall folder structure might be something like this:\n\n* raw\n   * source\\_A\n   * source\\_B\n* staging\n   * source\\_A\n   * source\\_B\n   * intermediate\n* catalog\n   * business\\_domain\\_1\n   * business\\_domain\\_2\n   * intermediate\n* reporting\n   * report\\_X\n   * report\\_Y\n   * intermediate\n\nHistorically, the raw layer above was our staging layer, the staging layer above was an intermediate layer, and all intermediate steps were done in the same intermediate folder, which I feel has become unnecessarily tangled as we've scaled up.",

Define Postgres tables with SQLAlchemy, then append the cleaned data into the table\n\nAlso, is Pydantic useful in either of these workflows for validating data types, or is it kinda superfluous since we are defining the data type on each column and casting appropriately?\n\nIf there are better recommendations, please feel free to free to suggest as well.

Like instead of SCD2 tables with e.g **dbt\\_valid\\_from** and **dbt\\_valid\\_to,** there would be just **date** column.\n\nIt would lead to massive increase of row counts but we could utilize partitioning on this column and because we use Dagster for orchestration it also make backfills easier (reload just 1 partition, change of history in SCD2 is more tricky) and we could also migrate the majority of dbt models to incremental ones.\n\nIt is basically the trade-off between storage and compute.

        "content": "**Background:** At RudderStack, I had been successfully using Postgres for the event streaming use case, scaled to 100k events/sec [thanks to these optimizations](https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/scaling-postgres-queue/). Nevertheless, I continue to further explore opportunities to optimize. So I and my team started experimenting with Pulsar (only for the parts of our system - data ingestion specifically). We experimented with Apache Pulsar for ingesting data vs having dedicated Postgres databases per customer (one customer can have 1+ Postgres databases, they would be all master nodes with no ability to share data which would need to be manually migrated each time a scaling operation happens).\n\nNow that it's been quite some time using Pulsar, I feel that I can share some notes about my experience in replacing postgres-based streaming solutions with Pulsar and hopefully learn from your opinions/insights.\n\n### What I liked about Pulsar:\n\n* **Tenant isolation is solid, auto load balancing works well:** We haven't experienced so far a chatty tenant affecting others. We use the same cluster to ingest the data of all our customers (per region, one in US, one in EU). MultiTenancy along with cluster auto-scaling allowed us to contain costs.\n* **No more single points of failure (data replicated across bookies):** Data is replicated in at least two bookies now. This made us a lot more reliable when it comes to data loss.\n* **Maintenance is easier:** No single master constraint anymore, this simplified a lot of the infra maintenance (imagine having to move a Postgres pod into a different EC2 node, it could lead to downtime).\n\n### What's painful about Pulsar:\n\n* **StreamNative licensing costs** were significant\n* **Network costs** considerably increased with multi-AZ + replication\n* **Learning curve** was steeper than expected, also it was more complex to debug\n\nWould love to hear your experience with Postgres/Pulsar, any opinions or insights on the approach/challenges. \n\nP.S. I am a strong believer in keeping things simple, using the trusted and reliable tools over running after the most shiny tools. At the same time, one should be open to actively experiment with new tools, evaluating them for your use case (with a strong focus on performance/cost). I hope this dialogue helps others in the community as a learning opportunity to evaluate technologies, feel free to ask me anything.\n",

        "author": "the-fake-me",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Let's assume we have a set of interdependent data models. As of today, we offer the analysts at our company to specify the schedule at which their data models should run. So if a data model and its upstream table (tables on which the data model is dependent) is scheduled to run at the same time or the upstream table is scheduled to run before a data model, there is no problem (in case the schedule is the same, the upstream table runs first).\n\n  \nIn the above case, \n\n1. The responsibility of making sure that the models run in the correct order falls on the analysts (i.e. they need to specify the schedule of the data models and the corresponding upstream tables correctly).\n\n2. If they specify an incorrect order (i.e. the upstream table's scheduled time is after the corresponding data model), the data model will be refreshed followed by the refresh of the upstream table at the specified schedule.\n\nI want to validate if this system is fine or should we make any changes to the system. I have the following thoughts: -\n\n1. We can specify the schedule for a data model and when a data model is scheduled to run, run the corresponding upstream tables first and then run the data model. This would mean that scheduling will only be done for the leaf data models. This in my opinion sounds a bit complicated and lacks flexibility (What if a non-leaf data model needs to be refreshed at a particular time due to a business use case?).\n\n2. We can let the analysts still specify the schedules for the tables but validate whether the schedule of all the data models is correct (e.g., within a day, the upstream tables' scheduled refresh time(s) should be before that of the data model).\n\nI would love to know how you guys approach scheduling of data models in your organizations. As an added question, it would be great to know how you orchestrate the execution of the data models at the specified schedule. Right now, we use Airflow to do that (we bring up an Airflow DAG every half an hour which checks whether there are any data models to be run in the next half an hour and run them).\n\n  \nThank you for reading.",

Do you think kubernetes is a good idea?\nAlso, if there are some downsides or drawbacks to clickhouse we should consider I am definitely up for some feedbacks on it!\n\n[Edit] our data volume is currently about 30GB/day, using Clickhouse it goes down to ~1GB/day\n\nThank you very much!",

We're talking days, not hours, for the sync to complete, which leaves our downstream dashboards and reports stale.\n\n**Our Current Setup:**\n\n* **Source:** HubSpot\n* **Destination:** Snowflake\n* **Integration Tool:** Airbyte\n* **Sync Mode:** Incremental Append + Deduplication\n* **Suspected Bottleneck:** We're almost certain this is due to the HubSpot API rate limits.\n\n**My Questions for You:**\n\n1. What tools or architectures are you using for this pipeline (Fivetran, Airbyte, Stitch, custom scripts, etc.)?\n2. How do you manage HubSpot schema changes without triggering a full, multi-day table resync?\n3. Are there any known workarounds for HubSpot's API limits, like using webhooks for certain events or exporting files to S3 first?\n4. Is there a better sync strategy we should consider?\n\nI'm open to any and all suggestions. Thanks in advance for your input!",

But it still seems a bit weird that there‚Äôs Apache Sedona and that‚Äôs about it. Where a new DAG package pops up once a week.  \n\n\nSo why does everyone think that is?  I‚Äôd lose to hear your thoughts",

That means your Pinecone index lags behind‚Äînew events, chats, or documents aren‚Äôt searchable until the next sync. For live systems (support bots, background agents), this delay hurts.\n\nTo solve this I've developed a streaming pipeline that takes data directly from Kafka, generates embeddings on the fly, and upserts them into Pinecone continuously. With Kafka to pinecone template , you can plug in your Kafka topic and have Pinecone index updated with fresh data. \n\n- Agents and RAG apps respond with the latest context\u000b \n- Recommendations systems adapt instantly to new user activity\n\nCheck out how you can run the data pipeline with minimal configuration and would like to know your thoughts and feedback.

Everything is monitored and tracked with Prometheus and displayed with Grafana. Kafka is used as the message queue, and MinIO is used to replicate an S3 bucket.\n\nIf you're the type of person that likes digging around in code, you can check the project out [here](https://github.com/bryanbritten/hl7-integration).\n\nIf you're the type of person that would rather watch a video overview, you can check that out [here](https://www.loom.com/share/3de54014865b4cb7aa59b87ec940626d?sid=271f23fd-7ade-4f82-864f-e2a288a96a36).\n\nI'd love to get feedback on what I'm getting right and what I could include to better represent my capacity for working as a Data Integration Engineer in healthcare.

I‚Äôd love to get advice from this community.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found so far (please correct me if I‚Äôm missing something):\n\nPostman ‚Üí Probably the most popular. Great GUI, lots of tutorials.\n\nHoppscotch ‚Üí A lightweight, open source alternative to Postman. Runs in the browser or self-hosted.\n\nBruno ‚Üí Stores collections as plain text, easy to version control (great for teams).\n\nHurl ‚Üí CLI-based, tests APIs using simple text files. Super clean for automation.\n\nYaak ‚Üí Made by the original Insomnia founder. Sleek UI.\n\nSoapUI ‚Üí Bit older but strong if you need SOAP and more complex protocols.\n\nApidog ‚Üí Similar to Postman, but I noticed it has a neat offline mode and works well for designing + mocking APIs.\n\nThunder Client (VS Code extension) ‚Üí Really handy if you don‚Äôt want to leave your editor.\n\n\nFor someone still learning programming, what would you recommend focusing on first?\nShould I start with a GUI tool like Postman/Bruno/Hoppscotch, or dive straight into CLI stuff like Curl/Hurl to build stronger fundamentals?\n\nWould love to hear what worked for you all when you were learning API testing.

My dad's a programmer and dealt with carpal tunnel in his 40s, so I'm trying to be proactive about this stuff.\n\n\n\nHere's what I've started doing that seems to help:\n\nTaking breaks: Set a timer for every 45 minutes, get up and stretch for 5 minutes. Actually doing this consistently has been harder than I expected but it makes a difference. This is necessary, the rest will pay off in the ling run guys. \n\nWrist stretches: Found some good ones on YouTube. The prayer stretch and wrist flexor stretches seem to help the most.\n\nBetter posture: Raised my monitor so I'm not hunching over. Best way to go about it is a standing desk but I don't have enough to invest in an automatic one (Magnus Pro looks so so good!) yet so I haven't gotten one yet. On the other hand, I am still working on keeping my shoulders relaxed, the anxiety I feel constantly keeps them clenched.\n\nSplit keyboard: This was probably the biggest change. Switched to a NocFree Lite about 4 months ago and honestly my wrists feel way more natural now. Takes some getting used to but the angle just feels right. NocFree Lite is just so light and easy to carry around. You'd think that the carrying part was annoying because of the 2 piece product but they provided a carrying bag with the board as well. \n\nProper mouse positioning: Moved my mouse closer and have been on a lookout for a vertical mouse. I've been checking out the Anker wireless vertical ergonomic mouse as well as the Logitech MX vertical, which one is better? Any other ergonomic mouse that I should check out?\n\nAnyone else dealing with this early in their programming journey? What's worked for you? Really don't want to end up like my dad with surgery and months of PT.",

Are there any youtube channels, platforms, or courses that might help put me on a more focused path?\n\nEdit: I recently came across a course called [CodeFast](https://productbible.com/blog/best-coding-courses#codefast) by Marc Lou and wanted to share it here because it seems to match exactly what I was looking for. It‚Äôs designed for entrepreneurs (even beginners) who want a hands-on approach to building and launching a real SaaS product. The course is modular, only about 12 hours of video, and walks you from the basics all the way through building and deploying a web app with a Next.js frontend, backend authentication (including Google OAuth), payment integration with Stripe/LemonSqueezy, and other practical stuff like emails, analytics, and custom domains. There‚Äôs a private Discord and ongoing support, plus a bunch of case studies from people who launched their first apps and even got paying users. I‚Äôve only started it but so far it‚Äôs been pretty good, and way less overwhelming than trying to figure everything out from scattered tutorials.

Atm im adding features to a web-app, i have the UI down, but now it comes to implementing all the code that is required for the UI to function and there are SO many things i have to keep in mind, from all the different edge-cases to how i design classes and their interactions so they are versatile, easy to work with and integrate with existing features without causing too many bugs and so on.\n\nI can usually get this done pretty good, but before i start im allways stunlocked by that task for even multiple days, where i just stare at the code and UI-Mockup and cant start working because i dont know where to start and how i wanna do all this stuff. It takes so much time for my mind to come up with a design that is satisfying to me and clear enough that i can start implementing.\n\nSo my question is: Do some of you who are more experienced have tips, tricks, anything that might help reduce that massive waste of time (thats what it feels like)? I guess what would help is to somehow write this stuff down or visualiize it with something like the Obsidian app, but i have no idea how to do this without wasting even more time.",

        "content": "I'm not sure if I'm the only person this applies to, but it's certainly very weird for me. For context, I am a sophomore, and in my two math classes Honors Algebra 2 and Honors Geometry, the concepts in there are not exactly impossible to understand, but a bit more difficult to grasp. However, when I learn mathematics for programming, it's much easier compared to math inside school. For more context, I am an ML Engineer, and I've learned much harder topics such as matrices, partial derivatives, derivatives, vectors, and overall just a good amount of calculus and linear algebra for programming. Although it's obvious that I'm not going into incredible depth with those topics, and it's only a basic understanding for what I need, I have created an entire AI from scratch before, and I'm creating another one with a shitty Scratch ripoff called MIT App Inventor, and for any AI nerds out there, that is not an easy task. You must be proficient in your understanding of programming & math, so how the hell can I do that but I can't learn what a domain and range is??\n\nI'm not exactly sure why this happens to me, but it certainly is weird. I should also mention that I learn much better when watching YouTube videos on math compared to learning math in school, so maybe it's just the way I learn. I have an Honors Algebra 2 test on domain and range and a bunch of other things tomorrow such as like increasing intervals and stuff like that, so I'm going to try and figure out a way that I can implement those concepts into programming somehow. If anyone wants an update, I'll post it here.\n\n  \nEdit: I tried implementing programming into my studying, but by the time I did I had already understood everything so there was no need (I'm not sure that makes sense, but when studying how to implement it into code I just eventually learned it so there was no need to..? It's hard to explain.) I was also learning on little sleep & food for the past few weeks or so, so that's probably another factor that should've been mentioned before. My test got pushed back to Tuesday due to people not having their notes filled out, so I guess I'll have to wait until then to see how I do.",

Yeah I can tell myself it's normal and that it's counterproductive to get mad at yourself but if I don't take a break for the day sooner or later I'll go down a spiral of self-doubt and frustration. That would be ok, but it's often as soon as I get really stuck at a problem which can be very early in the session especially with math assignments.\n\nAs a side info I'm in the second year of my cs degree and it's not going that well. First semester I passed everything but second semester was a disaster. Not necessarily because I was too stupid but because I didn't do anything. I've done a lot of programming courses on the side for the last few years (learncpp.com, odinproject, etc) but it's not getting better. I always had that problem with math.\n\nI'm not sure if it's just coding and logical thinking that's not for me or if that's normal? Because I really don't know what else I would do as a career path.",

        "content": "In your opinion, what would be the best programming language for someone to start learning as early as possible, and why?\n\nThis is a surprisingly controversial question in the programming world because different people value different aspects of coding when it comes to a beginner‚Äôs first step. Some argue that a beginner-friendly language like Python is best because it‚Äôs simple, readable, and widely used in fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and web development. Others claim that starting with a language like C or C++ is better because it forces you to understand how computers really work at a lower level, teaching concepts like memory management and efficiency right from the beginning.\n\nThere are also people who believe that JavaScript is the most practical first language, since it powers almost everything on the web, is relatively easy to pick up, and allows beginners to quickly see visible results in the form of interactive websites. On the other hand, some would say Java is a strong choice for its structure, object-oriented principles, and massive industry use, making it a good stepping stone to many career opportunities.\n\nBeyond that, there‚Äôs the philosophical debate: should beginners start with something easy and motivating, where they can see results quickly and not get discouraged? Or should they start with something challenging and foundational, where they‚Äôll struggle at first but gain a deeper understanding of computer science that pays off later?\n\nThe answer might even depend on age. For very young learners, visual block-based languages like Scratch or beginner-friendly ones like Python might be ideal. But for teenagers or adults who want to dive deeper into real-world applications, the choice becomes far less clear.\n\nSo, the debate is not just ‚ÄúWhich language is best?‚Äù but also ‚ÄúWhat matters more for a beginner: ease of entry, or long-term benefit?‚Äù",

I'm mostly looking here to hear your stories . anyone started \"late\" and found out it was worth it. and how  you dealt with the fact you might not be able to find a job soon after completing your studies . and before anyone asks of why I'm doing this . for me programming is like a superpower . when you create something to make something else easier in life or job or something , that's like a superpower . and the other thing . as I mature I see everyday problems that might need programning to solve or to automate. so I like thinking of a solution to a problem.

        "content": "Hello World.\nNaturally, I have a question about starting to learn programming.\n\nMy background:\nI‚Äôm 37 years old and have been working professionaly in level design and 3D environment art for games for about 10 years. I‚Äôve worked in six different engines (Serious Engine, Unity, CryEngine, OpenMW, and more). Most of my work has been in level design, and I‚Äôve also developed and released four solo games, three with Construct and one in Unity using the Adventure Creator plugin.\n\nWhen it comes to programming, I‚Äôve looked at other people‚Äôs code over the years, copy pasted, read it, and more recently I built a prototype with GPT‚Äôs help. I can now grasp what‚Äôs going on in code a bit, but naturaly I can‚Äôt yet write anything. To build a stronger foundation, I recently started Harvard‚Äôs CS50 course before committing to a specific language.\n\nSo far, I‚Äôm mostly a game designer, level designer, and 3D artist, but now I want to invest much more of my time into programming. My main interest is in learning a language that complements the kind of work I‚Äôve been doing.\n\nFor example, I‚Äôve always been fascinated by game engines and would love to understand how they work under the hood. I‚Äôm also curious about how graphics work in general, things like OpenGL and the workflows behind engine development. I don‚Äôt necessarily plan on building a full game engine myself, though maybe one day for a specific project, but for now I‚Äôm motivated by curiosity and a desire to really learn.\n\nMy question:\nWhat programming language would you recommend I start with? Are there any good books, courses, or other resources you‚Äôd suggest for someone like me?\n\nI‚Äôve read a bit here and there, and while I admit I‚Äôve felt somewhat discouraged lately with the rise of AI, I still really want to learn programming for myself, and hopefully to support my future projects.\n\nThank you",

        "author": "Bhosdsaurus",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "\n\nHey,\n\nI‚Äôm a fresher trying to build a project around data architecture concepts like bronze/silver/gold layers and all that jazz. I‚Äôm using MySQL for this because I want to get better with it for interviews and projects. I know i can use other tools to clean the messy data but i want to do it using sql to get some hands on experience wigh it\n\nThe trouble is, I have CSV files that contain a bunch of empty strings. MySQL won‚Äôt let me import those directly when my columns are typed as INT, DATE, etc. So I thought of two ways but both feel kinda inefficient:\n\n1. Create the table with all columns as `VARCHAR(50) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4`, import the raw data, then *later* clean the data by replacing empty strings with NULL or proper values, and finally convert each column to the right data type.\n\n2. Same as above but instead of replacing empty strings with proper values right away, I replace all empty strings with NULLs first, then work on cleaning/converting.\n\nI‚Äôm stuck because both approaches feel like extra work ‚Äî importing everything as text then cleaning and converting feels like a hassle, especially since I‚Äôm still learning.\n\nI‚Äôm also wondering if maybe I should just switch to MSSQL since I heard it‚Äôs more flexible with empty strings on import, but I really want to stick with MySQL for now.\n\nSo, any tips or best practices for importing messy CSV data with empty fields into MySQL? Am I missing a better way? How do you pros handle these kinds of data issues in real-world projects? Also, if you were me, would you stick to MySQL or try MSSQL instead?",

        "content": "Hello, I have a special use case for a score matrix and I would need help validating my thought process.\n\nWe have a 2D matrix which keeps a score value for each of its cells. At each step we want to extract the coordinates of the maximum value. After getting the maximum at location (x, y), we need to recalculate and update the scores for rows x and y and columns x and y. The number of rows is much smaller than the number of columns.\n\nThe general outline of the algorithm that I've conceived is as follows:  \n\\- Calculate initial scores\n\n\\- Initialize row\\_max array - an array which keeps the max for each row\n\n\\- Get the global max by iterating over the row\\_max array\n\n\\- Update row x and row y scores - also update the row\\_max array for those two rows\n\n\\- Update column x and column y scores - if updated value for cell (i, x) is greater than max of row i, update the row\\_max\\[i\\]; if updated value for cell (i, x) overwrites existing row\\_max\\[i\\], recompute row\\_max\\[i\\]\n\nIn my head this makes sense and in practice seems to work, but I don't know how to prove that this approach will always return the global maximum. I would like if anybody can chime and confirm whether this approach is optimal.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "Lately, I have been seeing a lot of posts around how engineers feel burnt out, stuck, or afraid AI will take their jobs.\n\nI can relate to this as well because not too long ago, I myself was that engineer who did good work like just working really hard, doing as many tickets as fast as I can, working overtime or on weekends, etc., but still felt completely invisible. Being introverted, I‚Äôd also join meetings, and just mostly stay quiet and never really contribute much. Honestly, it made me question if I‚Äôd ever stand out in any way.\n\nWhat surprised me was that things started changing not when I worked harder, but when I worked differently. I began focusing on things like communicating my work so people could actually see the impact, building trust and alignment with teammates, finding small ways to speak up and make my contributions more visible, etc.\n\nThat shift made a huge difference. I actually started working less, got a better work-life balance, and finally started getting the recognition I wanted. Also made me realize that promotions and opportunities ended up coming as a side effect of that shift, not because I was grinding harder.\n\nI know it‚Äôs tough because ‚Äújust do more tickets‚Äù feels like the safe path, but in my experience, it rarely leads to visibility. For me, changing how I worked gave me both better career growth and more fulfillment in the job.\n\nCurious if anyone else has felt the same?

I want to share what I learned over 10+ years that could save you from making the same mistakes I did.\n\nThe Reality Check:\n\nWhen I started, I thought being a good developer meant:\n\n\\- Memorising every framework and language\n\n\\- Writing perfect code from day one\n\n\\- Working insane hours to \"prove myself\"\n\n\\- Never admitting I didn't know something\n\nAll of this was wrong and held me back for years.\n\nWhat Actually Matters:\n\nFor Job Applications:\n\nYou don't need to meet 100% of job requirements. I got interviews, meeting 60-70% of the requirements. Companies hire for potential and problem-solving ability, not just current skills.\n\nFor Learning:\n\nStop trying to learn everything. Focus on core concepts (data structures, algorithms, design patterns) and learn specific technologies as you need them. The best skill is learning how to learn quickly.\n\nFor Career Growth:\n\nYou'll never feel \"ready\" for the next level. I spent 2 years over-preparing for senior roles I was already qualified for. Apply anyway, volunteer for challenging projects anyway, give that tech talk anyway.\n\nFor Productivity:\n\nWorking 45 focused hours produces better results than 70 exhausted hours. Burnout isn't a badge of honour, it's a career killer. Take breaks, have hobbies, maintain relationships outside tech.\n\nFor Code Quality:\n\nNobody cares about your clever algorithms. They care about solutions that work and code that's maintainable. Write for the human who will read your code at 2 AM during an outage.\n\nI've written a comprehensive blog post with detailed examples and actionable advice for each of these points: [https://medium.com/@pcodesdev/10-years-of-programming-hard-earned-coding-lessons-to-save-you-a-decade-of-mistakes-d63fd848e62e?sk=5bad34c41e6426a28387e89f4e1f5412](https://medium.com/@pcodesdev/10-years-of-programming-hard-earned-coding-lessons-to-save-you-a-decade-of-mistakes-d63fd848e62e?sk=5bad34c41e6426a28387e89f4e1f5412)\n\nCurrent developers: What do you wish you'd known earlier?\n\nJob seekers: Which of these resonates most with your current struggles?",

        "content": "Something that I'm realizing more and more is that even at the best companies, technical skills are usually not the differentiator. The key mover is in presentation/ politics.\n\nThis is because management, even if technical, don't have the time or ability to actually understand the work that is being done. At best, they get a high-level understanding of it. How that work is presented is much more important than the actual quality or quantity of work being done.\n\nWhen it comes to quality, it often looks better to build something passable that breaks a year later and do it fast than to build something that lasts a decade but takes a bit longer to build. Management almost always prioritizes short-term speed of delivery vs long term quality.\n\nThere's also the idea that dev work always sounds easier than it is unless broken down into smaller steps. Everyone knows that building a skyscraper is complicated and takes a long time. Building a website or an API seems easy until you explain all of the individual pieces needed to build that website or make that API. Yeah, we'll need a database, hosting, security, handling for payments, etc - and each of those can be broken down into much smaller pieces as well. It's not as simple as grabbing a cool wordpress design and swapping out the text.\n\nI think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.\n\nSo many devs end up doing work for people who don't even understand what they're asking for. This means that the ones asking definitely don't understand what separates good or bad quality work. Hence, the differentiator ends up being presentation/ politics or the gaming of performance metrics.",

Within minutes, applications started pouring in, tens of them right away, and within just two hours, we had hundreds. The applicants ranged from those with a couple of years of experience to developers with over 10 years in the UK tech industry.\n\nThis really highlights how competitive the tech job market has become. It feels like there‚Äôs a growing imbalance, far more developers than available positions. I don't recall this situation in the old hires. With new graduates entering the field each year, it‚Äôs unlikely the situation will improve anytime soon.\n\nIf you're job hunting, my best advice is to find a way to stand out. Do something that helps your application rise above the noise, because often the hardest part is simply getting your CV seen by a recruiter in a sea of hundreds.\n\n**Update** : I've previously received some questions about the role and would like to clarify a few things. I will not be able answer all questions but I would like answer some of them here;\n\n\\- The role is not a remote job, it's a hybrid role based in London Office.\n\n\\- We required right to work in the UK and no sponsorships.\n\n\\- The majority of applicants are based in UK with some exceptions of South Asian (India, Pakistan etc.), African (Nigeria, South Africa etc.) and North American (Canada and US) applicants in 10s.\n\n\\- We posted on multiple platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn and company website.\n\n\\- The whole process is overwhelming as human review will take quite some time to process all the applicants unless we switch to AI based CV reading tools.\n\n\\- The number of applicants surpassed a few hundred in the first few hours, and 1,000+ by the end of the first day of the job posting.\n\n\\- The salary is inline with average junior salaries in the UK which is between ¬£30k to ¬£40k.\n\n\\- There are a lot of uk based mid and senior engineers who apply, which shows stagnant job market which once only affected juniors, now clearly started to hit mid and senior levels too.\n\n\\- Additionally this is my burner/junk account, not my main account. I don't want to risk my job by making myself and my company identifiable, which could easily happen if I posted from my main account. I made sure, obviously, not to be the person who shares the company‚Äôs internal recruitment information on the internet.\n\n\\- Also I want to clarify that I craft and rephrase my paragraphs using ChatGPT and Grammarly, which is quite standard practice in this day and age.\n\n\\- If you have more questions feel free to reach me out via chat, I can't promise a response to all messages, but I will do my best.

Preferably something that doesn't get too in the way of me studying for certs.\n\n**For the long-term,** If it helps, again, I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science, a AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, and am currently studying for the CompTIA A+ certification because I figured maybe I can try the IT space if I hate programming so much (already paid for a voucher, planning to take the exam in \\~2 weeks). Unfortunately had no real work experience/internships in the Comp. Sci. field as I was too busy just trying not to drop out; took me 5 years to graduate. I've worked Doordash for a couple months using the family car, until my parents forbade me from doing so (for asinine reasons but it's their car so I can't talk back). I thought I was passionate in programming, I'm not. I have pretty much no passion in anything except games and anime, both industries sound awful to actually work in. Last week I started brainstorming a Unity game since I randomly thought it would be nice to work on something, anything, and put it on GitHub. \n\n**I'm well-aware that my story is not rare. Again, this is my fault. I've been too passive, and arrogant. But today I might as well ask for advice, both for the short and long-term. Thank you.** ",

I've met a lot of smart and wonderful people in my major and a fair share of them are very passionate and enjoy coding, whether it's reading a research paper about a specific topic they're interested in, making side projects for fun, joining a club for it, making a startup, etc. I just feel like I'm not into it as much as them and seeing this discrepancy daily makes me wonder if computer science just isn't for me. I don't enjoy watching youtube videos or reading about computer science, I don't really care about learning some new coding language and only learned the ones I currently know because it was required for the major, algorithms and the math of it don't really interest me, and I don't really have any side projects that interest me enough to code it.\n\nMaybe I just haven't found the right area of computer science that'll eventually hook me or maybe all my friends are just outliers and their passion isn't the norm, but I feel a little stuck as I'm trying to force myself to find something enjoyable about it, but besides the pay nothing else sticks out. I'm assuming the typical FAANG and SWE jobs are similar to the projects and assignments we did for my major, and if they are I just don't know if I can find myself doing that as a 9-5 for years of my life even if the pay is good.\n\nSo I guess my question is, how do you know when computer science as a career just isn't for you? At what point do you just shift to something else?",

I'd take a bit of time each week to dig into the technologies I was using at work to try and find non-functional areas we could improve in as I was grinding out functional stuff. over time this built up to an okay understanding of the SDLC overall.\n\nthere are plenty of areas I'm still not very strong, but at this point I have enough experience with enough different things that its relatively uncommon i encounter problems totally out of band from what I've seen before, and have a fairly decent understanding of many of the popular technologies used today across a wide span of problems. \n\nIve worked in a lot of different domains over my career. ive generally left most of the parsing of those domains to domain experts. sure, I'd pick up things here or there, enough exposure to particular verticals will do that, but I generally focused my time and energy on developing my tech knowledge, as it is more portable between jobs than domain specific stuff.\n\nthat said, I can now see the limits of this approach. I've been working in the same shop now for four years and I wish I had spent a little bit of time each week better learning the domain I am working in from first principles. I dont feel like I am lacking in technical ability. I have enough technical tools at my disposal. I feel I am lacking in domain specific insight, and so are the others surrounding me.\n\n If i had been studying my current domain a little bit more here and there over the past 4 years, I suspect I wouldn't feel this way. I suspect I would be able to crack some of the tough nut problems we've been dealing with sensibly.\n\nlooking back, there were plenty of times in past roles where I wasnt able to see the forest for the trees as a result of a little too much domain blindness & outsourcing of that knowledge to others who perhaps didn't know the domain all that well either.\n\nanyways, the advice I wish I had gotten was to carve out a bit of time for myself to learn the domain I was working in outside of the context of tech and programming. SWE skills are important, and most of the time we can learn the bits and pieces of a domain we need at the time, but some insights are locked behind both a general understanding of the tech and the domain.",

While it's always been a grind with the nonstop chats/calls/tickets, I legitimately enjoyed it at first for the first two years or so. My first company was awesome. They are one of the best web hosts to work for. I was a level 2 tech and a top performer, easily knocking out 80+ chats a day. My manager would constantly tell me how good of a job I was doing. Despite that, I struggled to afford living in the city the company was based in. I eventually asked for a raise and was offered a one thousand dollar per YEAR raise. It wasn't sustainable to keep waiting around for an actual raise, so I quit very shortly after that to move to a major cloud computing company as a cloud support engineer. I ended up hating that company almost immediately because of their lack of training, vague protocols, poor documentation and how they clearly viewed their support department as an after thought. Only 2 or 3 months out of training, they laid off 10% of their staff including me.\n\nI've since landed a different job at another web host as a support manager. I thought I would enjoy this role but truth be told I absolutely despise my job and my company. I feel that my work is meaningless and repetitive. The agents under me are basically un-coachable and uninspired. The tech debt is immense. The higher ups are too focused on pushing out half baked products that barely work. Our back end infrastructure is a nightmare. I spend most of my time troubleshooting stuff that should have been fixed years ago, yet engineering has no plans of doing so. \n\nEssentially, I'm stuck in support hell.\n\nI really like working with computers but the past three years have left me feeling so drained that I hardly have the energy to upskill and find a better, non-customer facing role. I don't like working in tech support and I don't like working in tech support management. I constantly think about working on certs to get a job as an SRE or DevOps engineer, but I'm worried that I'd find myself in the same position of not finding any satisfaction in it. Plus the tech market is so competitive now that I feel like I don't know where to even start. I'm left with the question of \"do I want to leave the tech world or do I just hate working in support?\"\n\nHas anyone else broken out of support hell into a more technical, non customer facing role? What did it take? Did it reshape your opinion of your work? Do you find it more fulfilling? ",

        "content": "\\[Senior DevOps Engineer, 17 YOE\\]\n\nHi. I'm at a crossroads in my life and I don't know what to do. I'm terrified and fearless at the same time.\n\nI'm 46 years old and so tired. Not just from work but tired in a way that's way deeper. A life of illness, stress, chaos, C-PTSD and then when I finally got back on my feet again - four more years of illness, cancer, surgeries. My body is scarred and worn down, even as my brain still wanting more of something. It's exhausting being in a brain that still dreams, in a body that can't keep up. No friends, no one to love. Just me.\n\nAt work, I tried to find meaning by stepping up. Looking at the bigger picture, connecting people, fighting for the things that make engineering great - systems that work, accountability, sustainability. What I really want to do is to bridge gaps, to build something... with joy. I'm operating at the Staff Engineer level alone - because no-one else is - and it's like threading mud in minus 20 degrees. Reality is fcking brutal and is weighing me down; it's eating away at my core values and taking all the fun out of my life.\n\nWhile management has fantastically supported me during my illness, they also lack true leadership. Fourteen years after starting the company the structure and behaviors are still stuck in start-up mode and often ends up looking for simple solutions to complex problems - or hope they will go away by themselves. The inertia is frustrating like... fck!!! Then there is the \"senior founder dev\" who only cares about code, knows he is untouchable, makes everything harder, belittles others, poisons the culture. And the colleagues I love and respect; the ones I thought could carry this with me, I can feel them pulling away, finding their own exits.\n\nIt has left me doubting; if that is the right word... what am I even holding onto? What the hell am I doing? What is the point??? :( \n\nI've lost joy in the work, but I still have passion when I can help people become better. My values haven't changed, but I have to push them aside every day, compromise after compromise, and that has slowly eroded my self-confidence and self-worth. I still want to work with smart, passionate people, to build something that matters - a product, a service, something that makes life a little bit better for someone else. I really do care about things running well. I care about people. But instead of feeling part of that, I feel stuck. I keep falling behind in technology while I fight my body (that tend to just shut down for three hours after lunch time). I'm trying to \"catch up\" and but I never quite get there...\n\nAnd outside of all this what I really crave is something... simpler and slower, I just don't know what. A house in the countryside maybe. A place that feels like home. Work that connects to who I am, not just what I can grind out. Maybe I should move back north and try to reconnect with my old friends and just do something outside of tech?\n\nWhat I don't know is how to get there without breaking more pieces of myself in the process. How to leave without bitterness and to stop running on fumes and start moving toward something I can actually love again.\n\n*tldr; my life isn't perfect, but I'm still here fighting - but there is no joy left and I've lost myself.*\n\n*PS. English is my secondary language and I closed my Grammarly account so apologize if the text is messy.*\n\n",

Now, it seems as if you meet every bullet point, you're still not the ideal candidate unless you have a lot more. \n\nI know this looks negative and lazy, but the problem is that in the last 5-10 interviews, I've literally had no notes on what I could prepare for next time as 99% of what I prepared for wasn't even related to the interview, and all the questions were framed like, \"Do you know Spring Boot?  Do you know Angular?\"  Even saying yes, they didn't ask me any questions to demonstrate that I knew it.  \n\nSo, the reason I haven't been applying much is that because when I finally do get an interview, I either nailed it and still get rejected for silly reasons, or I didn't get anything out of it, and with all that time of preparation and then the interview, I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber instead, so it's not really me being negative and thinking nothing is worth it, but more that interviews have become too much of a time investment with no return on it of either getting the job or getting more relevant interview practice. \n\nA bit about my background, I worked with Cognizant for 2 years mostly on the bench and on projects they ended up offshoring before any relevant experience and one job I got with an airline company, a month in they decided to disband the team because there wasn't enough work to be done and they just combined the services to other teams because we were spending several hours per day doing almost nothing.\n\nI don't feel I've ever been given a chance on any of my consulting projects as they seemed to only be using me as a contractor for a possible project not set in stone and ended up releasing me after budget cuts or offshoring. \n\nSo, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.  \n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way, or am I being ridiculous and a negativity spreader?

I did go to a competitive school so maybe my GPA can be contextualized ‚Äî hard to say though. I am in state for Texas, and I could potentially pay for TAMU or UT for a semester and gamble on getting a TA position.\n2. Opportunity cost. Say I do get a masters, there‚Äôs no guarantee I will get a job in ML, and I would end up working as a SWE anyway. Minus 2 years of comp\n3. There‚Äôs millions of MS CS grads in the market and I would be competing with them for jobs in an already shaky market.\n\nAnyone who‚Äôs been through this song and dance want to chime in? In my company moving internally to a research role is very rare so that‚Äôs not possible. I really enjoyed my ML research and coursework, and I am open to working for a university lab as a researcher, as a pathway for a PhD. The lab I interned at has changed direction and focuses more on computational biology, the ML project was a one off I guess. So there‚Äôs no going back to that. My long term goal is doing applied ML at a company or in academia. This is highly coveted and competitive, so any input would be appreciated.",

I currently work in big tech.\n\nI was very interested in the field prior to entering the corporate world. I found learning to code and getting my degrees challenging but rewarding.\n\nI strongly dislike corporate culture. I'm currently stuck at a company where I often feel disrespected. I'm treated like a fungible code slave and have to deal with the changing whims of management, bootlicking/ fakeness from coworkers, etc. Even technical management gets hung up on metrics that don't really mean anything. I constantly need to justify why the work I'm doing is important and the time it takes to compete, etc.\n\nSo that being said, I'd like to sidestep all of that and do my own thing. I know that startups have an extremely low success rate. So I'm wondering what other options there are that would allow the use of this skillset. Given that our job is problem solving at its core, it seems generalizable to a variety of things.\n\nWhey are your thoughts and/ or experiences with this?",

Love movies, very passionate, write a lot in my free time, directed a couple shorts for fun (worked on a couple of other student productions as well), vice president of a film discussion club (started this semester, so its been about 2 weeks). Been Marketing chair for a student organization for one semester in my sophomore year, and now doing the same position again (took a break in between as I transferred).\n\nIt suddenly dawned on me that companies like Canon, GoPro and other companies that produce technology need active software developers for research and development. My issue now is that\n\n1.) I don't have a job, not even a simple part time. I'm taking 16 credit hours, and very hard CS classes. I naturally have a learning curve in CS so it takes me longer than usual to get in to the groove and understand. The lack of ANY job, obviously makes me look bad and immediately puts me in a disadvantage\n\n2.) Only relevant CS experience is that I made a garbage GPT wrapper at a hackathon over a year ago. I also know Java and Python, but not certified in either of them.\n\nI'm feeling very hopeless because of this. My real passion is cinema, but in this day and age it's not wise to go into that field without backup. I think developing technology for cameras and other tools that filmmakers will end up using is something that can keep me content and fulfilled. Am I doomed? Can I mainly crack an internship by Summer 2026? What should I do?",

Sometimes deeming those non-urgent tasks as urgent.\n\n3. Swapping priorities of tasks multiple times in the same week.\n\n4. Asking for status updates on the tasks I stopped working on after he swapped the priority. Getting frustrated that there aren't updates.\n\n5. Meetings that feel more like an interrogation than a useful share of information.\n\n6. Quickly jumps from topic to topic without wrapping up the previous one.\n\n6. Makes decisions very fast without much information at all. This includes creating new meetings, cancelling meetings, creating new outings, letting people off early then asking them to stay for an adhoc meeting, etc.\n\n7. Reassigns work between different team members, also without much information or thought.\n\n8. Seems to be completely oblivious to how these constant disruptions are impacting members of the team (I and other have brought these up personally, and he denied it).\n\n9. Has a very anxious/ chaotic vibe. \n\nGenerally, he is hard to communicate with, or even get a clear idea of what he wants (or correct his unrealslistic expectation) at any given moment. He feels like a fly buzzing around my ears while I'm just trying to focus and get my work done. \n\nHow would you handle/ work with this manager to get on his good side and do well in the company? I like everything else about my team, so unless he becomes and active danger to my career, switching teams isn't on the table.\n\nI think this is a good potential learning experience to learn how to deal with this type of person.

I had applied to it back in July but got ghosted despite 2 assessments, but I the posting reappeared (maybe the person they offered the role to declined it?) so I applied again and I guess they remembered me from that first time. \n\nSo they call me and ask me if I'm still interested, if I have a means to get there, what my salary expectations are, if I'd be able to work on-site every day, etc. I keep it simple, say yes to everything, keep the salary expectation humble because I do still want this job and it's entry-level. And then they say \"when would you be able to start? Would you be available to start next week?\" (week of September 1st) to which I reply \"I don't think I'd be able to start next week, but I can start next next week, the week of the 8th\". Then we wrapped it up and they said I'd be hearing from them very soon. \n\nI didn't think much of it at first but nothing is REALLY stopping me from starting next week. I have some commitments but they could be postponed. I feel like I'm overthinking but I can't help but think about them going with somebody else who *could* start next week. Like that one line sabotaged this whole operation.\n\nThat being said, I looked through my recent calls and they had actually called me multiple times, on Monday and Tuesday (I tend not to pick up random calls). But I feel like if there were multiple other people they could've hired, they would've called me once, and then moved on to the next guy after I didn't pick up. But I find that equally as unlikely because this is cs and they must have tons of candidates. \n\nI know this reads as rambly but I'm just really holding out for this internship! ",
