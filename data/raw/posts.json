These are roles that were once US-based, and are now being reallocated to low cost regions.\n\nMy company's CEO has even quietly set a target of having a minimum of 35% of the jobs in each department located in a low-cost region of the world, and is aggressively pushing to move more and more positions to low cost regions through layoffs, restructuring, and natural turnover/attrition. I've heard from several peers that their companies seem to be quietly reallocating many of their positions, as well, and it's leaving me uncertain about the future of this industry in a high-cost region like North America.\n\nThe macro-economic research does still seem to suggest that technical data roles (like a DE or analytics engineer) are still stable and projected to stay in-demand in North America, but \"from the ground\" I'm only seeing reallocations to low-cost regions en mass.\n\nCurious if anybody else is noticing this at their company, in their networks, on their feeds, etc.?\n\nI'm considering the long term feasibility of staying in this profession as executives, boards, and PE owners just get greedier and greedier, so just wanting to see what others are observing in the market.\n\nEdit: removed my quick off the cuff list of low cost countries because debating the definition and criteria for “low cost” wasn’t really the point lol ",

This article also goes into the socio-technical challenges of implementation.  \n\n\n[**Zakariah Siyaji**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zakariah-siyaji/) **@ Glassdoor -** [**Data Quality at Petabyte Scale: Building Trust in the Data Lifecycle**](https://medium.com/glassdoor-engineering/data-quality-at-petabyte-scale-building-trust-in-the-data-lifecycle-7052361307a4)\n\nImplemented data contracts at the code level using static code analysis to detect changes to event code, data contracts to enforce expectations, the write-audit-publish pattern to quarantine bad data, and LLMs for business context.  \n  \n[**Sergio Couto Catoira**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergiocoutocatoira/) **@ Adevinta Spain -** [**Creating source-aligned data products in Adevinta Spain**](https://adevinta.com/techblog/creating-source-aligned-data-products-in-adevinta-spain/)\n\nImplemented data contracts on segment events, but what's really cool is their emphasis on automation for data contract creation and deployment to lower the barrier to onboarding. This automated a substantial amount of the manual work they were doing for GDPR compliance.  \n  \n[**Andrew Jones**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewrhysjones/) **@ GoCardless -** [**Implementing Data Contracts at GoCardless**](https://medium.com/gocardless-tech/implementing-data-contracts-at-gocardless-3b5c49074d13)[](https://medium.com/@andrew-jones?source=post_page---byline--3b5c49074d13---------------------------------------)\n\nThis is one of the OG implementations, when it was actually very much theoretical.

This contract spec is now under the Linux Foundation ([bitol.io](http://bitol.io/))! I was able to chat with Jean-Georges at a conference earlier this year and it's really cool how he set up an interdisciplinary group to oversee the open source project at Linux.\n\n\\----\n\n[**GitHub Repo - Implementing Data Contracts**](https://github.com/data-contract-book/chapter-7-implementing-data-contracts)\n\nFinally, something that kept  coming up in my research was \"how do I get started?\" So I built an entire sandbox environment that you can run in the browser and will teach you how to implement data contracts fully with open source tools.

        "author": "GehDichWaschen",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nTLDR: The team prefers SSIS over Airflow, I want to convince them to accept the switch as a long term goal.\n\nI am a Senior Data Engineer and I started at an SME earlier this year.\n\nPreviously I used a lot of Cloud Services, like AWS BatchJob for the ETL of an Kubernetes application, EC2 with airflow in docker-compose, developed API endpoints for a frontend Application using sqlalchemy at a big company, worked TDD in Scrum etc.\n\nHere, I found the current setup of the ETL pipeline to be a massive library of SSIS Packages basically getting data from an on prem ERP to a Reporting Model.\n\nThere are no tests, there are many small-small hacky ways inside SSIS to get what you want out of the data. The is no style guide or Review Process. In general it's lacking the usual oversight you would have in a \\*\\*searchable\\*\\* code project as well as the capability to run tests on the system and databases. git is not really used at all. Documentation is hardly maintained\n\nEverything is being worked on in the Visual Studio UI, which is buggy at best and simply crashing at worst (around twice per day).\n\nI work in a 2-person team and our Job it is to manage the SSIS ETL, Tabular Model and all PowerBI Reports throughout the company. The two of us are the entire reporting team.\n\nI replaced a long-time employee that has been in the company for around 15 years and didn't know any code and left minimal documentation.  \n\nGenerally my colleague (data scientist) does documentation only in his personal notebook which he shares sporadically on request.\n\n\n\nSince my start I introduced JIRA for our processes with a clear task board (it was a mess before) and bi-weekly sprints. Also a Wiki which I filled with hundreds of pages by now. I am currently introducing another tool, so at least we don't have to use buggy VS to manage the tabular model and can use git there as well.\n\nI am transforming all our PBI reports into .pbip files, so we can work with git there, too (We have like 100 reports).\n\nAlso, I built an entire prod Airflow Environment on an on-prem Windows server to be able to query APIs (not possible in SSIS) and run some basic statistical analysis (\"AI-capabilities\"). The Airflow repo is fully tested, has Exception Handling, feature and hotfix branches, dev, prod etc. and can be used locally as well as on remote.\n\nBut I am the only one currently maintaining it. My colleague does not want to change to Airflow, because \"the other one is working\". \n\nFact is, I am losing a lot of time managing SSIS in VS while getting a lower quality system.\n\nPlus, if we ever want to hire an additional colleague, he will probably face the same issues as I do (no docs, massive monolith, no search function, etc.) and will probably not get a good hire.\n\nMy boss is non-technical, so he is not of much help. We are also not in IT, so every time the SQL Server bugs, we need to run to the IT department to fix our ETL Job, which can take days.\n\nSo, how can I convince my colleague to eventually switch to Airflow?\n\nIt doesn't need to be today, but I want this to be a committed long term goal.\n\nWriting this, I feel I have committed so much to this company already and would really like to give them a chance (preference of industry and location)\n\nThank you all for reading, maybe you have some insight how to handle this. I would rather not quit on this, but might be my only option.",

        "content": "Hi!\n\nAs part of a client I’m working with, I was planning to migrate quite an old data platform to what many would consider a modern data stack (dagster/airlfow + DBT + data lakehouse). Their current data estate is quite outdated (e.g. single step function manually triggered, 40+ state machines running lambda scripts to manipulate data. Also they’re on Redshit and connect to Qlik for BI. I don’t think they’re willing to change those two), and as I just recently joined, they’re asking me to modernise it. The modern data stack mentioned above is what I believe would work best and also what I’m most comfortable with. \n\nNow the question is, as DBT has been acquired by Fivetran a few weeks ago, how would you tackle the migration to a completely new modern data stack? Would DBT still be your choice even if not as “open” as it was before and the uncertainty around maintenance of dbt-core? Or would you go with something else? I’m not aware of any other tool like DBT that does such a good job in transformation.\n\nAm I unnecessarily worrying and should I still go with proposing DBT? Sorry if a similar question has been asked already but couldn’t find anything on here.\n\nThanks!",

Essentially, I will have the following entity:\n\n* student\n* class\n* teacher\n* payment\n\nAnd while designing this new database, aside from migration, I'm currently planning ahead on implementing design choices that will help me with my work, some of them are currently this:\n\n* track payments (installment/renewal, if installment, how much left, etc)\n* attendance (to track whether or not the student skipped the class, more on that below)\n\nBasically, my company's course model is session based, so students paid some amount of sessions, and they will attend the class based on this sessions balance, so to speak. I came up with a two ideas for this attendance tracking:\n\n* since they are on fixed schedule, only lists out when they took a leave (so it wouldn't be counted on the number of sessions they used)\n* make an explicit attendance entity.\n\nI get quite overwhelmed with the rabbit hole of trying to make the db perfect from the start. Is it easy to just change my schema on the run? Or is what I'm doing (i.e. putting more efforts at the start) is better? How should I know is my design is already fine?\n\nThanks for the help!",

Engineers get documentation debt because maintaining it is a manual chore.\n\nWith Davia’s GitHub integration, that changes. As the codebase evolves, background agents connect to your repository and capture what matters—from the development environment steps to the specific request/response payloads for your API endpoints—and turn it into living documents in your workspace.\n\nThe cool part? These generated pages are highly structured and interactive. As shown in the video, When code merges, the docs update automatically to reflect the reality of the codebase.\n\nIf you're tired of stale wiki pages and having to chase down the \"real\" dependency list, this is built for you.\n\nWould love to hear what kinds of knowledge systems you'd want to build with this.

        "content": "I've been benchmarking ClickHouse 25.9.4.58 against Exasol on TPC-H workloads and am looking for specific guidance to improve ClickHouse's performance. Despite enabling statistics and applying query-specific rewrites, I'm seeing ClickHouse perform 4-10x slower than Exasol depending on scale factor. If you've tuned ClickHouse for TPC-H-style workloads at these scales on r5d.\\* instances (or similar) and can share concrete settings, join rewrites, or schema choices that move the needle on **Q04/Q08/Q09/Q18/Q19/Q21** in particular, I'd appreciate detailed pointers.\n\nSpecifically, I'm looking for advice on:\n\n**1. Join strategy and memory**\n\n* Recommended settings for large, many-to-many joins on TPC-H shapes (e.g., guidance on `join_algorithm` choices and thresholds for spilling vs in-memory)\n* Practical values for `max_bytes_in_join`, `max_rows_in_join`, `max_bytes_before_external_*` to reduce spill/regressions on Q04/Q18/Q19/Q21\n* Whether using grace hash or partial/merge join strategies is advisable on SF30+ when relations don't fit comfortably in RAM\n\n**2. Optimizer + statistics**\n\n* Which statistics materially influence join reordering and predicate pushdown for TPC-H-like SQL (and how to scope them: which tables/columns, histograms, sampling granularity)\n* Any caveats where cost-based changes often harm (Q04/Q14 patterns), and how to constrain the optimizer to avoid those plans\n\n**3. Query-level idioms**\n\n* Preferred ClickHouse-native patterns for EXISTS/NOT EXISTS (especially Q21) that avoid full scans/aggregations while keeping memory under control\n* When to prefer IN/SEMI/ANTI joins vs INNER/LEFT; reliable anti-join idioms that plan well in 25.9\n* Safe uses of PREWHERE, `optimize_move_to_prewhere`, and read-in-order for these queries\n\n**4. Table design details that actually matter here**\n\n* Any proven primary key / partitioning / LowCardinality patterns for TPC-H `lineitem`/`orders`/`part*` tables that the optimizer benefits from in 25.9\n\n**So far I've been getting the following results**\n\n**Test environment**\n\n* **Systems under test:** Exasol 2025.1.0 and ClickHouse 25.9.4.58\n* **Hardware:** AWS r5d.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 124 GB RAM, eu-west-1)\n* **Methodology:** One warmup, 7 measured runs, reporting medians\n* **Data:** Generated with dbgen, CSV input\n\n**Full reports**\n\n* **SF1:** Exasol vs ClickHouse (baseline, stats-enabled, query-tuned) [https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa\\_vs\\_ch\\_1g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html](https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa_vs_ch_1g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html)\n* **SF10:** Exasol vs ClickHouse (same three variants) [https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa\\_vs\\_ch\\_10g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html](https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa_vs_ch_10g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html)\n* **SF30:** Exasol vs ClickHouse (same three variants) [https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa\\_vs\\_ch\\_30g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html](https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa_vs_ch_30g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html)\n\n**Headline results (medians; lower is better)**\n\n* **SF1 system medians:** Exasol 19.9ms; ClickHouse 86.2ms; ClickHouse\\_stat 89.4ms; ClickHouse\\_tuned 91.8ms\n* **SF10 system medians:** Exasol 63.6ms; ClickHouse\\_stat 462.1ms; ClickHouse 540.7ms; ClickHouse\\_tuned 553.0ms\n* **SF30 system medians:** Exasol 165.9ms; ClickHouse 1608.8ms; ClickHouse\\_tuned 1615.2ms; ClickHouse\\_stat 1659.3ms\n\n**Where query tuning helped**\n\n**Q21** (the slowest for ClickHouse in my baseline):\n\n* SF1: 552.6ms -> 289.2ms (tuned); Exasol 22.5ms\n* SF10: 6315.8ms -> 3001.6ms (tuned); Exasol 106.7ms\n* SF30: 20869.6ms -> 9568.8ms (tuned); Exasol 261.9ms\n\n**Where statistics helped (notably on some joins)**\n\n**Q08:**\n\n* SF1: 146.2ms (baseline) -> 88.4ms (stats); Exasol 17.6ms\n* SF10: 1629.4ms -> 353.7ms; Exasol 30.7ms\n* SF30: 5646.5ms -> 1113.6ms; Exasol 60.7ms\n\n**Q09** also improved with statistics at SF10/SF30, but remains well above Exasol.\n\n**Where tuning/statistics hurt or didn't help**\n\n* **Q04:** tuning made it much slower - SF10 411.7ms -> 1179.4ms; SF30 1410.4ms -> 4707.0ms\n* **Q18:** tuning regressed - SF10 719.7ms -> 1941.1ms; SF30 2556.2ms -> 6865.3ms\n* **Q19:** tuning regressed - SF10 547.8ms -> 1362.1ms; SF30 1618.7ms -> 3895.4ms\n* **Q20:** tuning regressed - SF10 114.0ms -> 335.4ms; SF30 217.2ms -> 847.9ms\n* **Q21** with statistics alone barely moved vs baseline (still multi-second to multi-tens-of-seconds at SF10/SF30)\n\n**Queries near parity or ClickHouse wins**\n\nQ15/Q16/Q20 occasionally approach parity or win by a small margin depending on scale/variant, but they don't change overall standings. Examples:\n\n* SF10 Q16: 192.7ms (ClickHouse) vs 222.7ms (Exasol)\n* SF30 Q20: 217.2ms (ClickHouse) vs 228.7ms (Exasol)\n\n**ClickHouse variants and configuration**\n\n1. **Baseline:** ClickHouse configuration remained similar to my first post; highlights below\n2. **ClickHouse\\_stat:** enabled optimizer with table/column statistics\n3. **ClickHouse\\_tuned:** applied ClickHouse-specific rewrites (e.g., EXISTS/NOT EXISTS patterns and alternative join/filter forms) to a subset of queries; results above show improvements on Q21 but regressions elsewhere\n\n**Current ClickHouse config highlights**\n\n    max_threads = 16\n    max_memory_usage = 45 GB\n    max_server_memory_usage = 106 GB\n    max_concurrent_queries = 8\n    max_bytes_before_external_sort = 73 GB\n    join_use_nulls = 1\n    allow_experimental_correlated_subqueries = 1\n    optimize_read_in_order = 1\n    allow_experimental_statistics = 1       # on ClickHouse_stat\n    allow_statistics_optimize = 1           # on ClickHouse_stat\n\n**Summary of effectiveness so far**\n\n* Manual query rewrites improved Q21 consistently across SF1/SF10/SF30 but were neutral/negative for several other queries; net effect on whole-suite medians is minimal\n* Enabling statistics helped specific join-heavy queries (notably Q08/Q09), but overall medians remained 7-10x behind Exasol depending on scale",

Then, the user could ask natural language questions about the CRM data using the Claude AI desktop app or a similar tool, via a connection to the DuckDB MCP server. \n\nThese REST APIs require the user to be connected (using a session cookie or, in some cases, an API token) to the service and make potentially 1,000 to 100,000 API calls to retrieve all the necessary details.  To keep the data current, an automated scheduler is necessary. \n\n* I've built a Go program that performs the complete ETL and tested it, packaging it as a macOS application; however, maintaining database changes manually is complicated. I've reviewed various Go ORM packages that could add significant complexity to this project. \n* I've built a Python DLT library-based ETL script that does a better job normalizing the JSON objects into database tables, but I haven't found a way to package it yet into a standalone macOS app.   \n* I've built several Chrome extensions that can extract data and save it as CSV or JSON files, but I haven't figured out how to write DuckDB files directly from Chrome.   \n\nIdeally, the standalone app would be just a \"drag to Applications folder, click to open, and leave running,\"  but there are so many onboarding steps to ensure correct configuration,  MCP server setup, Claude MCP config setup, etc., that non-technical users will get confused after step #5. \n\nHas anybody here built a similar ETL product that can be distributed as a standalone app to non-technical users?

As a result, I find myself in a generic “data engineer” category, and my package is assessed accordingly, even though data engineering is only a part of my job and my profile is much broader than that.\n\nBefore, when I was at my small company, my package evolved comfortably each year as I expanded my skills and we relied less and less on external subcontractors to manage the data aspects that I did not master well. Now, even though I continue to improve my skills and expertise, I find myself stuck with a fixed package because my new company is unaware of the breadth of my expertise...\n\nSpecifically, on my local industrial site, I do the following:\n\n* Manage all the data ingestion pipeline (cleaning, transformation, uploading to the database, management of feedback loops, automatic alerts, etc.)\n* Manage a very large Postgresql database (maintenance, backup, upgrades, performance optimization, etc.) with multiple schema and broad variaty of data embedded\n* Create new database structures (new schemas, tables, functions, etc.)\n* Build custom data exploitation platforms and implement various business visualisations\n* Use data for modelling/prediction with machine learning techniques\n* Manage our cloud services (access, upgrades, costs, etc.) and the cloud architectures required for data pipelines, database, BI,… (on AWS: EC2, lambda, SQS, RDS, dynamoDB, Sagemaker, Quicksight,…)\n\nI added these functions over the years. I was originally hired to do just \"data analysis\" and industrial statistics (I'm basically a statistician and I have 25 years of experience in the industry), but I'm quite good at teaching myself new things. For example, I am able to read documentation and several books on a subject, practice, correct my errors and then apply this new knowledge in my work. I have always progressed like this: ir is my main professional strength and what my small company valued most.\n\nI do not claim to be as skilled an expert as a specialist in these various fields, but I am sufficiently proficient to have been able to handle everything fully autonomously for several years.\n\n **What job profile do you think would cover all these skills?** \n\n**=>** *I would like to propose a job profile that would allow my new large company to benchmark my profile* and realize that my package can still evolve and that I am saving them a lot of money (external consultants or new hires, I also do a lot of custom development, which saves us from having to purchase professional software solutions).\n\nPersonally, I don't want to change companies because I know it will be difficult to find another position that is as broad and intellectually so interesting, especially since I don't claim to know EVERY aspect of these different professions (for example, I now know AWS very well because I work on this platform on a day to day basis, but I know very little about Azure or Google Cloud; I know machine learning fairly well, but I know very little about deep learning, which I have hardly ever practised, etc.). But it's really frustrating to feel like you're working really hard, tackling successfully technical challenges where our external consultants have proven to be less effective, spending hundreds of hours (often on my own time) to strengthen my skills without any recognition and package increase perspective...\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n ",

At the moment, all this information is stored in a monolithic sheets (well I did divide atleast the student data and the class, connect them by id).\n\nBut, I'm a CS student, and I just studied dbms last semester, this whole premise sounds like a perfect case to implement what I learn and design a relational database!\n\nSo, I'm here to crosscheck my plan. I plan this with gpt.. btw, because I can't afford to spend too much time working on this side project, and I'm not going to be paid for this extra work either, but then I believe this will help me a ton at my work, and I will also learn a bunch after designing the schema and seeing in real time how the database grows.\n\nSo the plan is use a local instance of postgreSQL with a frontend like NocoDB for spreadsheets like interface. So then I have the fallback of using NocoDB to edit my data, or when I can, and I will try to, always use SQL, or atleast make my own interface to manage the data.\n\nHere's some considerations why I should move to this approach:\n1. The monolithic sheets, one spreadsheets have too much column (phone number, name, classes bought, class id, classes left, last class date, note, complains, (sales related data like age, gender, city, learning objective). And just yesterday, I had a call with my manager, and she says that I should also includes payment information, and 2 types of complains, and I was staring at the long list of the data in the spreadsheets..\n2. I have a pain point of syncing two different sheets. So my company uses other service of spreadsheets (not google) and there is coworker that can't access this site from their country. So, I, again, need to update both of this spreadsheet, and the issue is my company have trust issue with google, so I would also need to filter some data before putting it into the google spreadsheet, from the company one. Too much hassle.\nWhat I hope to achievr from migrating to sql, is that I can just sync them both to my local instance of SQL instead of from one to the other.\n\ncons of this approach (that i know of):\nThis infrastructure will then depends on me, and I think I would need a no-code solution in the future if there will be other coworker in my position. \n\nOther approach being considered:\n Just refactore the sheets that mimics relational db (students, classes, enrolls_in, teaches_in, payment, complains)\nBut then having to filter and sync across the other sheets will still be an issue.\n\nI've read a post somewhere about a teacher that tried to do this kind of thing, basically a student management system. And then it just became a burden for him, needing him to maintain an ecosystem without being paid for it.\n\nBut from what I see, this approach seems need little maintenance and effort to keep up, so only the initial setup will be hard. But feel free to prove me wrong!\n\nThat's about it, I hope you all can give me insights whether or not this journey I'm about to take will be fruitful. I'm open to other suggestions and critics!",

I've filtered their fact tables down to show only active jobs on our floor, and most of our reporting centers around that data. I built a Go ETL program that pulls data from Oracle and pushes it to Postgres every hour (currently moving about 1k rows per pull). My next step was to use dbt to build out proper dimensions and new fact tables.\n\n**Why the Migration?**\n\nThe company moved their on-premise Oracle database to Azure, which has tanked our Power BI and Excel report performance. On top of that, the database account they gave us for reporting doesn't have access to materialized views, can't create indexes, or schedule anything. We're basically locked into querying views-on-top-of-views with no optimization options.\n\n**Where I'm Stuck**\n\nI've hit a few walls that are keeping me from moving forward:\n\n1. **Development environment**: The dbt plugin is deprecated in IntelliJ, and the VS Code version is pretty rough. SqlMesh doesn't really solve this either. What tools do you all use for writing this kind of code?\n2. **Historical tracking**: The ERP uses object versions and business keys built by concatenating two fields with a `^` separator. This makes incremental syncing really difficult. I'm not sure how to handle this cleanly.\n3. **Dimension table design**: Since I'm filtering to only active jobs to keep row volume down, my dimension tables grow and shrink. That means I have to truncate them on each run instead of maintaining a proper slowly changing dimension. I know it's not ideal, but I'm not sure what the better approach would be here.\n\nYour advice would be appreicated. I dont have anyone in my company to talk to about this and I want to make good decisions to help my company move from the stoneage into something modern.\n\nThanks! ",

As titled, am I Missing Hidden Costs/Tradeoffs?\n\nWe're a small shop, 5 data people, <10TB of production data.\n\nWe used to run our analytics in the production's read replica, but nowadays it always timed out / failed bcz of transaction conflicts.\n\nWe're storing a snapshot of historical data every day for audit/regulatory purposes (as pg dump and restoring it when we need to do an audit.\n\nWe're moving our data to a dedicated place. We're considering ingesting our production data to a simple iceberg/s3 tables and using Athena for analytics.\n\nBut we're also considering Redshift serverless + Redshift's managed storage, which apparently, the pricing for RMS ($0.024/GB) is now closly matches S3 Standard ($0.023/GB in our region). Our data is purely structured (Parquet/CSV) with predictable access patterns.  \n\nFor the compute cost, we estimated that the RSS will cost us <500$/mo. I haven't estimated the Athena cost query because I don't know how to translate our workload into equivalent Athena scan cost.\n\nWith either of these new setup, we will take a full snapshot of our postgres everyday and dump it to our datalake/redshift\n\nWhy I'm Considering Redshift:  \n\n\\- We're pretty much an all-in AWS shop now, not going to move anywhere in the quite long term.  \n\\- Avoid complex data lake/iceberg maintenance  \n\\- I can still archive snapshot data older than a certain period to the cheaper S3 tier when I need to.\n\nI'm coming here from the idea that I can have an exabyte of data on my storage, but that won't affect the performance of my DB if I don't query it.  \nOn Redshift, I'm thinking to achieve this by either 1. storing older snapshots on a different table or 2. using \"snapshot\\_date\" as a sort key so that unrelated data will be filtered when doing a query\n\nQuestion:\n\n1. Does this storage model make sense?\n2. Are there hidden compute costs? (from vacuuming/optimization)",

I am using data generators to Lazy load the data with pandas wrangler and turn it into a tensor. I have already parallelized my lazy loads, but I’m running into a couple of roadblocks that I was hoping the community might have answers to. \n1. What is the most efficient/standard way to lazy load data from an s3 parquet table? I’ve been iterating by partition (utc date + Rand partition key) but it’s a pretty slow response time (roughly 15 second round trip per partition). \n2. My features and targets are in separate s3 tables right now. Is there an efficient way to join them at load or should I set up an upstream spark job to join the feature and target set to a single bucket and work from there? My intuition is that the load and x-process of handling that join for a disjoint set will be completely inefficient, but it would be a large data duplication if I have to maintain an entire separate table just to have features and targets combined in one parquet file. Any insight here would be appreciated!\nThank you!",

Vector ditched it in 2021 because of performance and maintenance burden, but the wasmtime team has recently made major performance improvements since (with more exciting things to come like async!) and it felt like a good time to experiment to try it again.\n\nWe benchmarked a go WASM transform against a pure go pipeline + transform and saw WASM throughput within 10%.\n\nThe big win for us was not passing logs directly into wasm and instead giving it access to the host memory. More about that [here](https://docs.telophasehq.com/runtime)\n\nLet me know what you think!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I have a question regarding integration of Azure DevOps and VS Code for data engineering in Fabric.\n\nSay, I created notebook in the Fabric workspace and then synced to git (Azure DevOps). In Azure DevOps I go to Clone -> Open VS Code to develop notebook locally in VS Code. Now, all notebooks in Fabric and repo are stored as .py files. Normally, developers often prefer working interactively in `.ipynb` (Jupyter/VS Code), not in .py.\n\nAnd now I don't really know how to handle this scenario. In VS Code in Explorer pane I see all the Fabric items, including notebooks. I would like to develop this notebook which i see in the repo. However, I don't know I how to convert .py to .ipynb to locally develop my notebook. And after that how to convert .ipynb back to .py to push it to repo. I don't want to keep .ipynb and .py in remote repo. I just need the update, final .py version in repo. I can't right-click on .py file in repo and switch to .ipynb somehow. I can't do anyhting.\n\nSo the **best-practice workflow** for me (and I guess for other data engineers) is:\n\nWork interactively in `.ipynb` → convert/sync to `.py` → commit `.py` to Git.\n\nI read that some use jupytext library:\n\n`jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py:light notebooks/my_notebook.py`\n\nbut don't know if it's the common practice. What's the best approach? Could you share your experience?",

        "author": "dRuEFFECT",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Principal Data Architect - this is the title my director and I originally threw out there, but I'd like some opinions from any of you. I've heard architect is a dying title and don't want to back myself into a corner for future opportunities. We also floated Principal BI Engineer or Principal Data Engineer, but I hardly feel that implementing Stitch and Fivetran for ELT justifies a data engineer title and don't feel my background would line up with that for future opportunities. It may be a moot point if I ever try going for a Director of Analytics role in the future, but not sure if that will ever happen as I've never had direct reports and don't like office politics. I do enjoy being an individual contributor, data governance, and working directly with stakeholders to solve their unique needs on data and reporting. Just trying to better understand what I should call myself, what I should focus on, and where I should try to go to next.\n\nBackground and context below.\n\nI have 14 years experience behind me, with previous roles as Reporting Analyst, Senior Pricing Analyst, Business Analytics Manager, and currently Senior Data Analytics Manager. With leadership and personnel changes in my current company and team, after 3 years of being here my responsibilities have shifted and leadership is open to changing my title, but I'm not sure what direction I should take it.\n\nBack in college I set out to be a Mechanical Engineer; I loved physics, but was failing Calc 2 and panicked and regrettably changed my major to their Business program. When I started my career, I took to Excel and VBA macros naturally because my physics brain just likes to build things. Then someone taught me the first 3 lines of SQL and everything took off from there.\n\nIn my former role as Business Analytics Manager I was an analytics team of 1 for 4 years where I rebuilt everything from the ground. Implemented Stitch for ELT, built standardized data models with materialized views in Redshift, and built dashboards in Periscope (R.I.P.).\n\nI got burnt out as a team of 1 and moved to my current company so I can be a part of a larger team, at first I was hired into the Marketing Department just focusing on standardizing data models and reporting under Marketing, but soon after started supporting Finance and Merchandising as well. We had a Senior Data Architect I worked closely with, as well as a Data Scientist; both of these individuals left and were never backfilled so I'm back to where I started managing all of it, although we've dropped all projects the data scientist was running. I now fall under IT instead of Marketing, and I report to a Director of Analytics who reports to the CTO. We also have 3 offshore analyst resources for dashboard building and ad hoc requests, but they primarily focus on website analytics with GA4.\n\nI'm currently in the process of onboarding Fivetran for the bulk of our data going into BigQuery, and we just signed on with Tableau to consolidate dashboards and various spreadsheets. I will be rebuilding views to utilize the new data pipelines and rebuilding existing dashboards, much like my last company.\n\nWhat I love most about my work is writing SQL, building complex but clean views to normalize/standardize data to make it intuitive for downstream reporting and dashboard building. I loved building dashboards in Periscope because it was 100% SQL driven, most other BI tools I've found limiting by comparison. I know some python, but working in that environment doesn't come naturally to me and I'm way more comfortable writing everything directly in SQL, building dynamic dashboards, and piping my data into spreadsheets in a format the stakeholders like.\n\nI've never truly considered myself an 'analyst' as I don't feel comfortable providing analysis and recommendations, my brain thinks of a thousand different variables as to why that assumption could be misleading. Instead, I like working with the people asking the questions and understanding the nuances of the data being asked about in order to write targeted queries, and let those subject matter experts derive their own conclusions. And while I've always been intrigued by the deeper complexities of data engineering functions and capabilities, there are an endless number of tools and platforms out there that I haven't been exposed to and know little about so I'd feel like a fraud trying to call myself an engineer. At the end of the day I work in data with a mechanical engineering brain rather than a traditional software engineering type, and still struggle to understand what path I should be taking in the future.",

In particular:\n\n* Will these tools give us everything we will need for CI/CD? Are there any gaps we'll find once we start using them?\n* Are snowflake roles easy to maintain via Terraform?\n* How best to use these tools to handle schema drift? I see dbt has an on schema change feature that can help with schema change by adding new columns and ignoring deleted ones. Does this work well? Is it best to use dynamic tables when landing data into Snowflake for the first time and then use dbt to move it to the data model?\n* I see some people use schema change but can dbt not do the same thing?\n* Terraform looks like it destroys and recreates objects but I have read we can set a flag to stop this on specific objects. Does this work well?\n\nThanks for any help",

You define file patterns, validation rules, and transformations in the registries, and the tool:\n\n* Matches input files to patterns defined in the registry\n* Runs validators (e.g., required columns, null checks, value ranges, hierarchy checks)\n* Applies ordered transformations (e.g., strip whitespace, case conversions)\n* Writes reports only when validations fail or transforms error out\n* Saves compliant or transformed files to the output directory\n* Generate report with failed validations\n* Give the user maximum freedom to manage  and configure his own validators and trasformer\n\nThe process is run by the [main.py](http://main.py) where the users can define any number of steps of Validation and trasformation at his preference. \n\nThe main idea is not only validate but provide something similar to a well structured template where is more difficult for the users to create a a data cleaning process with a messy code (i have seen tons of them). \n\nThe tool should be of interest to anyone who receives data from third parties on a recurring basis and needs a quick way to pinpoint where files are non-compliant with the expected process.\n\nI am not the best of programmers but with your feedback i can probably get better.\n\nWhat do you think about the overall architecture? is it well structured? probably i should manage in a better way the settings.\n\nWhat do you think of this idea? Any suggestion?\n\n",

So, I work for a small company and it is non-profit. I have been given this task to build a dynamic dashboard. The dynamic dashboard must be able to track grants, and also provide demographic information. For instance, say we have a grant called ‘grantX’ worth of 50,000$. Using this 50,000 the company promised to provide medical screening for 10 houseless people. Of these, 50,000 the company used 10,000 to pay salaries and 5000 for gas, and other miscellaneous things, and the rest 35,000 to screen the houseless individuals. The dynamic dashboard should show this information. Mind you, there are a lot of grants and the data they collect for each grant is different. For example they collect name, age of the person served for one grant but they only get initials for the second grant. The company does not have a database and only uses office 365 environment. And most of the data is in sharepoint lists or excel spreadsheets. And the grant files are located in a dropbox. I am not sure how to work on this. I would like to use database and things as it would strengthen my portfolio. Please let me know how to work on this project. Thanks in advance!!\n",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I would like to share a story about my current experience and the difficulties I am encountering—or rather, about how my expectations are different from reality.﻿\n\nI am a data engineer who has been working in the field of data processing for 25 years now. I believe I have a certain familiarity with these topics, and I have noticed the lack of some tools that would have saved me a lot of time.﻿\n\nAnd that’s how I created a tool (but that’s not the point) that essentially, by taking JSON or XML as input, automatically transforms them into a relational database. It also adapts automatically to changes, always preserving backward compatibility with previously loaded data.﻿\n\nAt the moment, the tool works with databases like PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and Oracle. In the future, I hope to support more (but actually, it could work for all databases, considering that one of these three could be used as a data source after running the tool).﻿\n\nLet me get to the point: in my mind, I thought this tool could be a breakthrough, and a similar product (which I won’t mention here to avoid giving it promotion) actually received an award from Snowflake in 2025 because it was considered very innovative. Basically, that tool does much of what mine does, but mine still has some better features.﻿\n\nNowadays, JSON data is everywhere, and that has been the “fuel” that kept me going while developing it.\n\nA bit against the trend, my tool does not use AI—maybe this is penalizing it, but I want to be genuine and not hide behind this topic just to get more attention. It is also very respectful of privacy, making it suitable for those dealing with personal or sensitive data (basically, part of the process runs on the customer’s premises, and the result can be sent out to get the final product ready to be executed on their own database).﻿\n\nThe ultimate idea is to create a SaaS so that anyone who needs it can access the tool. At the moment, however, I don't have the financial resources to cover the costs of productization, legal fees, patents, and all the necessary expenses. That’s why I thought about offering myself as a consultant providing the transformation service, so that once I receive the input data, clients can start viewing their information in a relational database format\n\nThe difficulties I am facing are surprising me. There are people who consider themselves experts and say that this tool doesn't make sense, preferring to write code themselves to extract the necessary information by reading the data directly from JSON—using, in my opinion, syntaxes that are not easy even for those who know only SQL.﻿\n\nI am now wondering if there truly are people out there with expert knowledge of these topics (which are definitely niche), because I believe that not having to write a single line of code, being able to get a relational database ready for querying with simple queries, tables that are automatically linked in the same way (parent/child fields), and being able to create reports and dashboards in just a few minutes, is truly an added value that today can be found in only a few tools.﻿\n\nI’ll conclude by saying that the estimated minimum ROI, in terms of time—and therefore money—saved for a developer is at least 10x.\n\nI am so confident in my solution that I would also love to hear the opinion of those who face this type of situation daily.\n\nThank you to everyone who has read this post and is willing to share their thoughts.\n\n  \n",

I’m currently focused on using 4 channels of context (eg https://open.substack.com/pub/evanvolgas/p/building-your-four-channel-context) and building a shared context library (eg https://open.substack.com/pub/evanvolgas/p/building-your-context-library). I have thoughts on how to maintain the library and some observations about the length of context files (despite internet “best practices” of never more than 150-250 lines, I’m finding some 500 line files to be worthwhile). I also have some observations about pain points of working with Dbt models, but may simply be doing it wrong.

        "content": "This is what I understand. I kind of need some basic explanation to know where to look for things when I want to get deeper into this.\n\n  \nTCP and UDP are part of the **transport layer** in the tcp/ip stack and all layers up to that one are implemented by the **os kernel**. So my application won't have to implement it, it would use **system calls**.\n\nFor a web application a **client** and my **server** will communicate. The client will open a **tcp connection** with the correct **socket** ( ip : port 80 or 443 ) of my server. The client is e.g. the browser.\n\nSo now we have client and server with an open **tcp connection**.\n\n  \n**HTTP** is a protocol in the **application layer** in the tcp/ip stack so it has to be implemented by an application. In a nutshell, http is basically just a standard for how the string of text sent over the tcp connection is structured to be valid.\n\nThe **webserver** thats being communicated with is an application, so it implements the HTTP protocol. It can either serve static files or call programs or scripts and give the **request data** as a parameter. The application can then produce an answer. No matter if static or dynamic content is served, pretty much the webserver responds to the request it received\n\n\n\nSo that's my basic understanding at I think its correct. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here already.\n\nTLS is also an application layer protocol, so it has to be implemented by an application. I heard of libraries like OpenSSL implementing them.\n\nBut where do I **turn on HTTPS** now? Since the server has to be able to serve static content or forward requests to an application or a script, I'd guess in the server? But what if my application doesn't directly run on that server and the request will be forwarded, the server would send the decrypted regular HTTP for the rest of the path to my application.",

You can look for explanatory videos for specific problems along the way.\"\n\nI find that to be an interesting perspective. I would like to know what others think about it.\n \nI've completed about 40% of the course and it's a long one.

I feel like I’m learning things temporarily, not really *understanding* them deeply.Yesterday hit me hard my mentor asked a simple question about something basic, and I just froze. I couldn’t answer. I felt so dumb and that moment made me question if I’m even cut out for this.But deep down, I **really love programming**. I love problem-solving, creating things, and the feeling when something finally works. I just don’t know how to move forward when I keep forgetting what I learn.\n\nIt hasn’t been long since I started, but I already feel like I’m behind everyone else. Should I restart from zero and rebuild my foundation? Or is there a better way to actually *retain* and *remember* things long term?If anyone here has gone through the same thing forgetting concepts, doubting yourself, feeling stuck how did you get through it?  \nWhat actually helped you improve your memory and confidence while learning to code?Any tips, motivation, or study habits would mean a lot. I really don’t want to give up on something I truly care about.\n\n Ps i forgot to mention that i enrolled a program but they are really in rush imagine in this 2 months  we already passing through front end dev and java script and also react / react js  and now  react native",

Get the paddles moving, get the ball bouncing, etc. I'm sure it'd be fun, but I'm worried that he'd see the results, and compare it with, like, AAA game titles and just be totally disappointed. How could I organize a really successful session where he's happy with what we do? Maybe something like programming a simple NPC in an RPG game or something like that? Is there any pre-made game system with programmable \"characters\"?\n\nAnother idea I had was one of these robotics kits like Lego or Vex, they both seem to support Python in addition to Scratch, but they are quite expensive -- still it's maybe an option, maybe someone can report their experience with using it for teaching?",

My posture is getting better and the compact 60% design also frees up desk space which is nice when I am juggling multiple devices.  \n  \nThe layout took a few days to click especially the right side and some Fn combos but now it feels pretty natural. Typing is quiet, smooth and the little thumb keys are actually useful (again took some getting used to). Wireless mostly works but if I type really fast, sometimes it stumbles and makes me backspace a few times. I also miss a proper battery indicator but I guess its not that bad a thing.  \n  \nBeyond comfort, the customization options are a real productivity boost. I’ve been using Vial to set up extra layers and remap keys. I can even remap keys to control the mouse which is quite handy for my workflow (like scrolling or navigating code without leaving the keyboard). Hot-swappable switches mean I can tweak the typing feel over time without having to replace the whole board so I like the long-term use I’ll get out of it.  \n  \nOverall it has been a small change that’s actually improved my learning speed. Sharing it here for anyone curious about split boards. Those who already use one, how long did it take you to get used to the layout?",

He was explaining how he learned programming from the very small selection of books his library offered, but mostly from NEWSPAPER CUTOUTS. On top of that he was programming games in assembly!\n\nWhen it comes to problem sets, I find that I learn best without the help of ai. But I ask this question in regards to googling as well because this is something I'm very indecisive about. I'll give an example, the other day I was working on a CS50 problem set and I ended up spending too much time trying to make over complicated for loops to compare each char in an array of strings. Then, when I finally googled it, I found out there was a function in a library that did it for me. Maybe this isn't the best anecdote because I could've read the documentation on the library before hand, but I hope you get my point. I also think ai is so much more looked down upon than googling, but I think both can reinforce the same bad habits, I.e when things get difficult you end up relying on something else. \n\nI understand that it wasn't the limited resources that made John Carmack into John Carmack. However, I personally think a scarcity in resources indirectly makes you remember things better. \"Why would I need to remember the syntax differences in declaring a function in JS vs Python if the answers are a couple clicks away.\" \n\nI'm genuinely curious to hear what your opinions are on this. What would be ways to balance this? Could the complete opposite of googling everything be beneficial, i.e only picking a handful of resources and limiting yourself to that? ",

I am now responsible for building an MS Access Reporting tool and using Excel, SQL, and VBA, and documenting our existing codebase for our \"applications\".\n\nWhile I enjoy my work, I recognize that working with VBA isn't what programming looks like in the typical sense of the word. I don't record macros, but there's a lot of abstraction in VBA and I feel like it's quite different from in depth programming work people do in python and other languages. I'm not dealing with C pointers, or data storage problems, or even serious optimization issues. I feel like I might like \"scripting\" instead of \"programming\", but I'm not even sure how to define the difference between the two, apart from how programming involves more technical memory allocation while \"scripting\" is the surface level \"do this do that\" of programming.\n\n  \nTL;DR: Do I like programming or scripting? And if I like scripting, what does that mean for my self-education journey (I'm currently re-introducing myself to Python)?\n\n",

For experienced developers - would you recommend this workflow for a beginner, or should I just buy a Mac from the start?\n\nI'm trying to figure out if anyone actually uses Windows to build iOS apps, but I can't find much on YouTube or anywhere else showing this workflow in action.

How do I decide what constructors to make? Should I have a default constructor that takes no parameters and another constructor that takes all parameters? Or should I aim to have as many constructors as possible to cover all possible combinations and orders of parameters? I am not sure which one is preferred and why.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.

Took me about a week..... He was mind-blown when I showed him the final result 🤣🤣\nJust after that, something clicked.. I actually enjoyed doing all that. So I started learning HTML and CSS on freeCodeCamp, and honestly, I’m finding it fun and kind of addictive....\n\nNow I’m wondering if I should take this seriously and maybe change careers down the road. But I need some guidance from people who’ve been there or know the field...\n\nShould I go for frontend, backend, or full stack?\n\nWhat’s the best way to learn and practice at the same time?\n\nAny must to use resources or roadmaps for someone starting fresh plz ?\n\nAny advice or feedback would be super appreciated. 🙏",

My courses are completely online and asynchronous, which is great. But the resources provided are not always the greatest and expect completely green students to take in and have a full understanding of concepts that are more suited for those who have years of experience. The course is IT 315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design. I'm pretty nervous about it, as a lot of students have said it's the most difficult course they've taken throughout their studies. My understanding of programming/coding is extremely rudimentary at best, ranging from the MySpace days of editing HTML to a basic SQL class I took a few months back. That's about it. \n\nOur textbook for the course is Systems Analysis & Design: An Object-Oriented Approach with UML, 6th ed. I also just purchased a book called Head First Object Oriented Analysis & Design by Brett McLaughlin, which I have heard is great for a visual representation of the basics. Aside from actual books, does anyone have any online tutorials or videos that may be helpful for getting started here? From the very beginning of understanding the underlying concepts. The simpler, the better. I don't even know what UML is, other than that it stands for Unified Modeling Language. No idea what that means! Obviously Google will be my best friend for this class, but if anyone here has trusted resources that they've found helpful, I would definitely appreciate the guidance. TIA\n\nNote: I've already searched past threads on this and other subs for more information and resources. They weren't very helpful as most threads only had one or two replies.",

        "content": "in concept art, there is a term called 'kitbashing' where people use assets to make a collage to build their project off of, whether it is using a 3d render to paint over for a 2d illustration or using kits of generalized parts such as screws or technical looking parts of machinery.\n\nThis is likely a stupid analogy, but I have viewed this to be similar to using tutorials. So far, when I am designing a program from scratch, I make a diagram where I roughly describe and draw out features, then I try to write down potential places I could find an example of the feature. usually it starts with generally describing the feature in google \"How to draw a line between two objects in godot\" for example, then I start looking up classes in the godot library I can use and watching tutorials of feature implementation that is somewhat similar.\n\nBut I often get stuck trying to then understand the code in the tutorial and studying whether the method used in the tutorial is the most efficient way for my project, or if I cannot find a tutorial that is directly relevant I struggle to try and take apart the code line by line in the documentation.\n\nBut as a programming beginner, I also don't really understand the design of a library. I may roughly understand the description of a function such as vector2 get\\_point\\_position(index:int) for example returning the position of a point, but I  may not understand the underlying design, such as how I still don't understand how a vector can have an index, or whether it's the 2d line itself  that is an array containing points.\n\n  \nInitially I thought there was some holy grail book of software architecture & programming library design that if I read, I would have a rough idea of how to outline the implementation of any project, I wouldn't awkwardly type in a rough description of my feature into google but I would rather have a label for the type of data structure and algorithm the feature uses and knew exactly where to look in the library documentation, or if developing from complete scratch.\n\nI've went through CS50, reviewed the programming fundamentals of addresses, pointers, OOP principles, intermediate programming in java implementing binary searches and linked lists etc, but my implementation skills still really suck, even after making a design diagram and pseudocode, I never know where to look in order to translate my pseudocode into a specific function in a library or a class from scratch. It feels like I am somewhat a native speaker in 'design', but I barely know my alphabet in terms of implementation.  \n\n",

It adds up to **1,403 cuts statewide** — it’s unclear how the overall cuts might be affecting subsidiaries. (Amazon also owns Audible, Twitch, Goodreads, Whole Foods, Zoox and Ring.)\n\nWho are these laid-off workers? **Software development engineers make up the largest category, with hundreds of cuts listed across the documents**. Amazon is also shedding recruiters, business analysts, marketers and managers. The layoffs in Irvine and San Diego, where Amazon has video game studios, include dozens of game designers and game artists.\n\nThis sheds some light on how affected SWEs were by this layoff in California at least. Not sure about other locations. The total layoff number is 14000",

I tried bambooHR (no actual parsing capability whatsoever) and greenhouse (the parsing is so bad it's not even worth using). Is ts a myth? Why is it so big in our mind that ATS is like some god algo.\n\nWithin the first 40 or 50 apps i already had enough people to interview. like 15 maybe. good enough. after that i stopped scrolling. THis is how people get ghosted.\n\nI also noticed linkedin and indeed were showing my post HOURS later. Appararently every job on there needs to get approved. It showed up like 6, 10, 12 hours after I tried posting it. so if you apply there, you’re already late.\n\nit made me realize maybe it’s not about being perfect. maybe it’s just about being early. first.\n\nidk. felt like someone should say it out loud. hope it helps someone.

But ever since the news of layoffs started spreading internally, he’s been living in constant panic.\n\nHe literally jumps at every phone notification. His heart starts racing every time his phone buzzes, thinking it might be that email. The \"you’ve been impacted\" one.\n\nHe barely sleeps..maybe 2 or 3 hours a night.\nHe told me people who got laid off earlier received their emails after midnight or early morning, so now he stays awake in constant fear of that notification. Imagine being that scared of an email.\n\nHe keeps saying \"I'm sure I'll be next. They like people who talk a lot. I just…..work.\"\nAnd the sad part...he’s really good at his job. But his manager once told him that his communication skills are a little off and he needs to work on that. He was okay with this initially and agreed to work on it but with the constant state of fear and overthinking he thinks this could be one of the deciding factor.\nThere are some new hires in his team..they’re young, confident, articulate..and he feels invisible next to them and assumes he’s automatically at risk.\n\nIt’s heartbreaking to see someone who’s great at what they do be this mentally wrecked by uncertainty. The kind of fear that turns your phone into an anxiety trigger.\nThese corporates don’t talk enough about what layoffs or even the fear of layoffs do to people mentally. It’s brutal. I see the fear of losing job breaks you long before the layoff does.\n\n",

I’d like to invest time in really mastering a field — contributing to open source, reading deeply, and discussing ideas — rather than only relying on AI tools.\n\nSo: which field do you think is still worth diving into and becoming truly knowledgeable about?",

        "content": "After about 5+ years in this field, I've realized that it's always better to prefer polish over speed.\n\nThe reason is simple. Unless you work in an extremely isolated silo, you are not entirely responsible for your speed.\n\nWhen people review your code you don't get bonus points for how quickly you wrote it.\n\nHowever, if there are issues with your code, for that you are entirely responsible.\n\nIf there's some edge case that you didn't properly check, you're responsible for that.  \nIf you missed some step in preparing your PR, you're responsible for that.  \nIf your code is difficult for others to read, you're responsible for that.\n\nManagers will always want you to be fast but speed is a shared responsibility.\n\nYou cannot be fast if the code base you inherited is a mess.  \nYou cannot be fast if the company keeps changing direction.  \nYou cannot be fast if your work is rate limited by other people or systems.\n\nI've found this applies across orgs of all levels.\n\nIn big orgs you'll be slowed down by more processes and structure.\n\nIn small orgs the lack of process and structure increases the potential for mistakes and misunderstandings.\n\nWithout really knowing the ins and outs of what someone is working on, it's hard to say if they're actually slow but a mistake is a mistake. Now and forever. When it comes time for performance reviews, no one will have the context to know if the time you spent was reasonable but if someone is looking to get rid of you, they will form a collage of every single wrong-doing you committed since the day you joined.\n\nSo remember, slow down and try to consistently get everything right on the first try.",

I’ve owned the whole lifecycle: idea→ design → UX/UI → development → QA → bug fixes and user support.\n\nI assumed shipping a product with real users and revenue would be a strong early-career signal. So far, though, it hasn’t seemed to move the needle in early screens for internship/student/entry-level SWE roles.\n\nFor context: GPA 88/100 (\\~3.52/4). I also built a portfolio site and a product site in Next.js (not linking here).\n\n**Now for my question:** If a shipped product like this isn’t considered strong signal, what *does* count as projects or experiences that help students stand out for early-career SWE roles?

Stripe is going to force me to work Hybrid.   \nThis is a massive lifestyle change I was not anticipating. It is a 1h20m commute via train into Toronto. \n\nI have been thinking about the possibility of receiving an offer for Hybrid work and genuinely I cannot decide if it would be worth it... going over some pros/cons:\n\nPros:  \n\\- \\*Big pay increase (140k All salary-> \\~250k TC)  \n\\* Unsure about pay change after tax.. RSUs in Canada are taxed insanely  \n\\- Huge name on my resume  \n\\- Chance to learn some of the best software practices and learn from very smart people\n\nCons:  \n\\- Will likely have no WLB (from what I read online.. Stripe has the full PIP and stack rank culture)  \n\\- I feel like I am pretty much guaranteed to get burnt out within 1-2years  \n\\- Stock packages given as RSUs in Canada, which are taxed at 50% IIRC ... the increase in comp may not be as big as it would seem? \n\n\\---  \n  \nI would love some opinions. I am leaning to thinking it might not be worth it since I could only see myself there for something like 1.5-2yrs.\n\nI cannot decide if I should say YOLO and accept the offer for the overall experience... or if I should accept my current solid position and not F with my solid setup.

There were of course a few other languages and experience levels sprinkled in, but not that many. Fast forward to now and I have been watching indeed for a week or so. There are now over 300 listings, and filtering by entry level and full stack, there are 30 with 2 new postings today (although filtering full stack is also including jr fe and backend solely jobs as well, but hey I’ll take it). The city is not a tech hub, so there is no FAANG positions, but I’m not sure if I’d be too interested in that anyways. But, that does bring up the point that I could luckily just be in a less competitive area or something. \n\nAnyways, it’s not record breaking or anything and you can’t really determine a trend break with two data points.

So they hired me on as CTO and I was thrilled for the upgrade at the time. \n\nBut I am looking for a change of pace and want to work on new challenges in a different space altogether. I had a few interviews earlier this year and they all mentioned that they liked my resume but were worried that my actual dev skills would be diminished, as they assume because of my C-suite title that I must not be doing much actual dev work. I explained that if anything, my skills have gotten sharper, as I am still the only dev working here and have to handle the bulk of the IT issues in addition to my dev and CTO responsibilities. \n\nSo I have a few questions for you all:\n1. Would you think a CTO is not capable of proper dev work anymore?\n2. Should I be looking for Senior/Staff SWE roles or is it time to make a change to Product/Project management type of roles?\n3.

This was my first post-grad job.\n\nGot pulled aside this morning and was told \"today's your last day here,\" out of nowhere. The reasoning they gave was along the lines of not meeting \"velocity,\" despite no expectations or timelines explicitly being put into place. It was a solo project with little guidance, and I required access to tools I wasn't initially provided and had to ask for, which definitely slowed the pace. There were no warnings and no PIP. They inferred that I wasn't meeting the expectations for the position and the pay.\n\nWas told to leave immediately. It was right after I completed my first major deliverable. I was genuinely shocked, as at the beginning my boss was very pleased with my work and liked to show it off; I'd worked extra on nights and weekends in response to my boss's messages to get the project done whilst also tackling my online masters. There seemed to be conflicting expectations between moving fast vs initial code quality between two of my authorities, and I often had difficulty getting timely support or permissions from the dev team.\n\nI'd love some advice moving forwards. I just relocated across the country for this job and have pretty limited savings and a year's lease to pay. The company offered a release agreement with small severance.\n\nI'm also not the first person to be let go from this role; another person was let go under a month ago for similar vague reasoning he also wasn't aware of.

I was already on the verge of burning out because I was on track for promo but \"because of org changes we don't know when exactly it'll happen\"\n\nSo I've started applying for internal positions well before this event but now with this news I got a decent severance package and due to my accrued PTO+ Years spent in this firm, i think overall I'll get almost 6months of pay. \n\nNow, i also have an option to pursue an internal position in an adjacent team which is basically a 1:1 mapping of my current role and I know that team works a lot and the work over there is mehh or at least not that interests me long term but also likely not be able to prep for interviews due to the expectations. \n\nI can basically pull some strings and have high confidence i can get that offer, but if they offer and regardless of whether i accept or reject i'll loose this severance package. \n\nIt's clear to me that 6month pay is much better than this internal position but i'm on H1b and have until March 2026 to find a job. if not I'm screwed or i'll have to think about changing to B1/B2 to buy time or joining a consulting firm which i want to avoid. \n\nWith this job market and all this VISA bs i'm not really sure if i can find a new job within March, but the thought of 6month severance without doing any work seems really sweet to recover mentally and get on the leetcode grind. \n\nWhat do you think is the better play? should i just pull my internal applications and get out with severance and try my luck outside? (Somewhat confident i'll find something in 6 months). Or take that internal position and be safe, loose that sweet severance work for some time and switch with position of power? \n\nI personally want to take severance but with this VISA limbo i'm super confused about what's better. \n\n  \nReally appreciate all your help/advice here. \n\n",

        "content": "Last week I came across a post from an employee at **Corgi** on LinkedIn (his job title was literally *“AI Insurance @ Corgi”*, lmao) looking for “cracked engineers.” I InMailed him sharing my interest and he replied with a calendar link to schedule a meeting before the so-called *work trial* at their office.\n\nToday I joined the meeting five minutes early to respect his time since he works at a startup and I figured that matters. Apparently they don’t think the same way. Minutes passed, no one joined. I waited for **20 minutes** and just when I was about to leave he finally joined. No apology for being late, no acknowledgment, and honestly he didn’t even seem to care about the call. He wasn’t paying attention, barely looked at me, and was probably scrolling on his phone the whole time.\n\nI had a few doubts about the startup, mainly what their *work culture* is like and what I should expect from this so-called “work trial.” When I tried to make conversation and ask about these things, he gave one-line answers and told me to email my GitHub and portfolio links (which I had already shared along with my resume a week ago). The meeting lasted barely **four minutes**.\n\nNow here’s where it gets weird:\n\n1. I couldn’t find a single solid resource about what this startup actually does or builds. Their website is just a plain landing page with almost no info.\n2. They claim to be backed by a bunch of VCs, but after checking the official portfolios of those firms, I couldn’t find *Corgi* listed anywhere except for one out of the six they mention.\n3. Their work culture looks sketchy. I saw posts where they proudly mentioned gifting mattresses to employees so they can “stay in the office 24/7.”\n\nFor a startup that floods LinkedIn with posts about hiring “engineers” (basically glorified 24/7 slaves), this entire interaction felt really off and suspicious.\n\nHas anyone else heard of or interacted with this startup? Everything about them screams red flag to me.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi All! Apologies for writing another one of those posts. But I am genuinely looking from some honest career advice because I feel so lost and defeated.\n\nI graduated a year ago from a T20 university. I unfortunately graduated with 0 work experience, aside from being a TA for a few semesters. I was only a CSE major my last two years of college and I couldn't land an internship in that summer between them\n\nRecently, I had an interview for an internship position for a large company that I was able to secure through a referral. Shortly after the interview, one of the engineers on the panel told me that they want to move forward with me but that I should hold tight for the official offer letter for a couple weeks as they are amidst a hiring freeze. I felt a huge sense of relief and excitement that I was finally going to land a position after months of despair. Fast forward a month later, I get an email from the recruiter that the position is no longer being filled. Needless to say, I felt absolutely crushed.\n\nThis is especially demoralizing because I have never been this close to landing a position as I rarely get interviews. I get rejected or ghosted for pretty much every application I send out. I feel like recruiters are avoiding me like the plague. I suspect it is because they are prioritizing this year's batch of new grads for junior positions. This is making me feel like my window to get my foot in the door has closed.\n\nI have even applied to some IT, QA, and analyst positions but it seems like even those are hard to get these days, especially without certs. I have also been searching for internships but finding one that is also open to grads is extremely rare.\n\nAside from applying, I have been LeetCoding, building projects, and filling in knowledge gaps using things like The Odin Project to learn full-stack development skills. I also recently finished a volunteering gig as a \"web developer\" but all I did was help build a site using a low-code website builder.\n\nI am getting the feeling that my family is getting tired of me freeloading, and I am running out of cash. So I am now trying to reassess my options and I am hoping to get some advice/anecdotes from people on here.\n\nWay I see it, I have the following options:\n\n1. Continue on the job search grind. But until when? I am running on fumes and I am getting very depressed from doing this, with little results to show. Maybe focus on non-SWE IT and analyst roles, but again finding a truly entry-level position that doesn’t require certs or experience is pretty rare.\n2. Go get a master's degree in CS. The ROI on this one is not clear at the moment and I am already in a decent amount of student debt from undergrad. But this does reset the clock and make me eligible for an internships again, and I will work really fucking hard to secure one. However, I am worried about my prospects, since I had a so and so GPA (3.4) and no research or work experience. I am also currently broke so funding the degree will be difficult, especially without all the recent funding cuts.\n3. Apply to the military as an officer. Stable employment but I still have to get in and I hear it's challenging for those outside of the military. Besides, this is not a very appealing option due to recent events and I will most likely not be doing any software engineering.\n4. Look for a non-tech job. I know that this will challenging as other job markets are also struggling. It hurts me to think that all my hard work on my CS degree will mean nothing and it feels like once I accept a non-tech related position, my chances of making it into this industry will officially become 0. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading my post\n\nP.S. my resume can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/C3MpeyT) if anyone is curious.",

It's about 99% of my applications that lead to nothing so it feels like I'm not competitive at all, it feels like I'm just wasting my life away. I've been spending pretty much all day every day applying or working on unpresentable projects but neither of those feel like they are doing anything. Even in the rare case I get a call or something I feel like my experience and projects aren't competitive either? I ask myself \"what do I have that puts me ahead of someone with X years of experience\" and I just have nothing at all.\n\nMy experience is kind of a lost cause, I don't have good metrics for any of them and they were pretty subpar (last few years were working with stuff that isn't really CS related but I can't remove them or else it looks like I have a massive job gap and the system will reject me instantly.\n\nI don't have any ideas for projects I should be making that are exciting or will get me a job at all? I've been making a chess engine thing this past month but it doesn't feel like a real project so in effect it was a waste of time? I don't really have any exciting stories about how I solved a problem that no other person has ever solved anything like it, because it's just implementing various algorithms other people have already made and there is no difficulty to doing that? In terms of metrics it is pretty garbage, it can only search about 10k positions per second while a \"good\" chess engine can do several million per second easily.\n\nI don't know how to make something that isn't some random toy project, currently all my side projects are games where being a toy project is part of the point and there's only 1 class project that isn't a game and it probably doesn't count either as it has nothing in the way of metrics either. I don't really have motivation to try to make a banking website or something like that, because I know it isn't real so it will never have any real purpose and companies will see it as not fulfilling its purpose so it doesn't count? I'm just looking for a way to make something with big flashy metrics or a compelling exciting story about how I solved a completely unsolved problem but I'm just getting nowhere.",

I've had several meetings with my manager discussing my potential and how to improve my metrics. Received advice from senior eng on how to work faster. Watched projects get passed to new hires since I'm no longer reliable. \n\nI completely agree with the negative feedback I've received. I wouldn't even be surprised if I get fired during my next performance review.\n\nAnd it's not that the work's become too difficult after the promotion either (I'm doing similar work as before). It's just that everyday I work feels like a little part of me is suffocating. It's gotten so bad that I've been daydreaming about when I  worked retail jobs on night shifts during college (legitimately think that was more enjoyable for me than this job). \n\nI don't know if I'm just not built for a corporate job. The tight deadlines, horrible WLB, constant comparisons with coworkers, etc. All of it has been causing me so much stress, and my health has gone to hell this year because of it I think. Several days this month, I've just stared at my laptop screen, feeling like I physically could not do any work that day. \n\nI'm really frustrated with myself, because I grew up pretty poor and I think, if 12yo me knew I was complaining this much about a job paying me six figures, I'd punch myself in the face. \n\nI'm hoping I can get some advice from people who've felt similar:\n1. Am I just depressed or is my job really not a good fit for me? \n2. Do I try to push through this feeling to keep my job or should I start job hunting?\n3. Should I try to switch career fields if I do look for new employment? \n4. Also, can someone reassure me that moving to the middle of nowhere and becoming a hermit isn't actually a valid solution?",

I've applied to hundreds of companies at this point, and I've heard back from only a handful of them, both to set up an interview and to let me know they're moving forward with other candidates. It seriously feels like there is a 5% or less chance of actually getting any sort of response. At this point I'm not really sure what to do.\n\nI've been debating on returning to school to pursue a second degree in data science, as it seems to be the most relevant field of business pertaining to comp sci. There's a solid chance of me getting into the school I want, and there are a couple of scholarships I could apply for to help me out tuition-wise, plus I'd already have some credits done (mostly gen-ed) from my previous degree. **I guess I'm writing to ask what others in this same position are doing or thinking with the current state of the C.S. economy in the US.** It feels like a degree in C.S. just leads you to a dead-end road, and I don't know if it's worth sticking to at this point.",

The company is great, people are nice, pay for my area is pretty good, etc. I was offered to continue my internship part time through the school year and have continued working there ever since. Apparently, it is rare for them to extend such an offer, and the full timers on my team tell me that I will most likely be offered a job upon graduation. I do not ever put my eggs in one basket, ESPECIALLY on the foundation of “most likely”. So, last school year after accepting the internship I applied for my Masters in CS with an emphasis in ML. I was accepted into the program, but now I am having doubts given the current job market. My plan was to find a data science internship and try to transition into ML after getting my masters, but I keep getting rejected. Now, I am at a cross roads between pursuing SWE, where  I have experience, or keep pursuing my passion of ML. \n\nSide note: I am more interested in Computer Vision, where i currently have a research assistant position. I understand that this likely requires a PhD, but I am also open to more traditional ML roles. ",

Some examples: maintaining and making new tables for our database (there's talk of redesigning the whole db), writing a basic script people run to keep files standardized, porting our data processing scripts to another group's system, making tableaus and designing KPIs for random manager requests, and my latest is modifying one of our main C# programs to accommodate another group (and whatever other changes have built up over time).\n\nIt all sounds well and good, but my concern is that I don't have any oversight and that everything seems to fall in the toy project category. None of the code I've written has been complicated, and there have been libraries for everything. I don't have a senior to call me an idiot and ask why I did things a certain way - the only metric I have is whether the tool I made works and whether I did it fast enough for people not to ask again. \n\nThe point of this post is to ask what I should do to mitigate that. What can I do to move into a pure dev role after this (I'm a test engineer and have that workload on top of my dev stuff). I'm worried that I'm 'poisoning the well' by getting light dev experience without any guide. I am worried that I will essentially still be entry level as long as I stay here. Any thoughts or actions would be huge. ",

        "content": "I (32M; Singapore) feel as though I've hit a wall in my current role. I have 7 YoE of Web Development (4 in my current) and I'm not learning the things I want to learn, or seeing progress in terms of promotions and title-growth. The culture has also degraded after the company I joined was merged into another (I joined a bank in end-2021 that collapsed in 2023), and a lot of the original, interesting people I thought I could learn from has left for other companies or moved onto other internal positions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFor context, my Project is some back-office data aggregator that ingests data from different sources and exposes it to downstream middle-office and front-office applications via REST API and Elasticsearch. This sounds ok, until you realize that we don't get any credit for the accomplishments of the downstream applications (which Business people can relate to), whilst still taking the heat for when the data is not what they expect it to be (i.e. we effectively just redistribute our upstream data under this new company). My daily work now involves more firefighting rather than technically challenging and inspiring tasks, and my Team Lead and I are the only ones in the Team that handles the firefighting, the rest don't.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nTo be fair to this Project, every year since joining I learnt something technically \"interesting\".\n> * 1st year (2022) was an introduction to Backend Work and Technologies - learning how to use Mongo and Kotlin, writing proper Unit and E2E Tests (my previous companies didn't mandate tests, relying instead on a QA Dept to ensure correctness).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> * 2nd year (2023) was tying all that I've learnt thus far into making a Full-Stack Project from the ground up - creating a Gradle Task for putting the Frontend Client-Side Bundle into the Resources Folder of the Kotlin Project and serving that, using the Quarkus framework instead of http4k, GitLab CICD Pipelines, integrating Sonarqube for both Javascript and Kotlin Source Code, using Kaniko to create a new Application Image and using Helm Charts to configure and run the Application Image onto Openshift. This new Project would have been important, to quote my former Line Manager, had my company not collapsed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> * 3rd year (2024) was trying to replace our former f5 / haproxy certficate-based authentication with OAuth2 / OIDC on a company centralized IDP. Supposedly this was required so that systems from the new company could access systems hosted within the old company's network. I managed to integrate OIDC on our Dev env for our UI, until it was suddenly no longer needed; someone high up pushed for something so that many Projects didn't have to individually change for this. And so many weeks of Dev work went down the drain.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>* 4th year (2025) involved shifting our Project to be hosted on Azure Cloud services. For my part, I had to replace our old FTP Servers (we receive data in files and process them in batches) to the Azure-equivalent - Azure Blob Storage connected to an Event Grid which sends Blob Creation Events to our Event Hub, and change the Project Code to listen for those via a Kafka Interface. This should have been interesting to me, but it just felt meh. Probably because the new company had an in-house abstraction layer over the ARM / Bicep Templates via Ansible Roles - I think I would have liked it more if I dealt directly with Azure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThere were other tasks in the background that I felt were mildly interesting too - writing code to process large text files in parallel (using nio for the Random Access and Kotlin IO Coroutines) for data analysis being one.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI did try to go for a few interviews but I think the main problem is that my experience is not in demand - my Project is primarily written in Kotlin and http4k, and that greatly limits the search because the closest equivalent that is more popular is Java and Spring / Springboot and in this market hiring managers can pick other candidates that have the exact skillset that they are looking for rather than having to settle for candidates with adjacent skills. I used to do Frontend with React, but that was over a year ago since the UI of the project has been descoped. I feel like even if I dedicate time to learning Java and Spring / Springboot, hiring managers would just choose candidates with direct hands-on professional experience instead of experience with side projects, or pick fresh graduates instead. Probably another issue is that I can't recite my experience like how I did above on demand / in real-time - my verbal communication skills are lacking.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt just feels very, very difficult motivationally to dedicate free time outside of work to get myself into a better position - like I _really_ don't want to spend even more of my waking time outside of work having to work for something that might not even pay off. I know staying in this role will probably eventually end my career, but it's like, what's the point? The market is horrible and AI is somehow _still_ the reason mass-layoffs are happening even though I see endless chatter on Reddit that it's not all that it's cracked up to be. Honestly, it feels like I'm just waiting for the music to stop and get laid off - at least I then have an excuse to take a break.",

This sprint I realized that for tasks I consider to be really complex, it’s even faster if I take baby steps and reason through it while using ai to fill any knowledge gaps or bridge my memory. But man… today I watched a senior do in an hour what I couldn’t do in five hours. And it wasn’t even his story, it was mine. He just reasoned through it and based off my explanations actually gave me a working solution to something that was really stressing me out. Like this was a story that our team considered max complexity points wise, but I’m still. Then I heard my manager talking about how I should be doing all my points and each point is like only a certain number of hours and how I should still have hours left over. I’m like, how can I know ahead of time how many hours a task will take me if I find things out mid sprint?\n\n\nAnd I’m like man… watching people do so effortlessly what takes me ages is honestly kinda painful. Like I almost shed a tear today because I was like “bro this is too much I can’t do this and the deadlines soon…” and I’m honestly tired of feeling stressed and angry over development work. And even if I end up with a working solution, it isn’t “clean”, like it isn’t up to par and my tech lead might just be like “redo this.” \n\nI get juniors have a learning curve. I get that. But it’s been a year. I had my old tech lead say 6 months in “I don’t even know how to help you. Help me help you at this point” because I did a story incorrectly and he caught it near the end of the sprint. He always said I struggled or asked about simple things and give poor feedback to my manager on how I need to much help often.  I can’t remember what’s inside an object and how that object matches to this list with this key blah blah my brain just for some reason cannot reason through it like other people can.\n\nIt’s gotten to the point where not only am I not taking a portion of the sprint for stories and a portion for whatever else like my manager expects, but I’m working at night, on weekends, I even sometimes would log in on a pto day to ask a question, and I’d often struggle to the point where it would feel like I get nothing done\n\nI just don’t know what’s going on or how to move forward with this. I never wanted to stay a dev, I always wanted to move to the business side, but I’m a dev now so I have to at least do the best I can in this role. \n\nI know I won’t stay a dev, but since I’m a dev now, what is going on here? Like, I just don’t understand what’s happening with me? Imposter syndrome or just not competent to do the work?\n\nBtw: I usually never cause carry over or defects, 95% of my stories are accepted. I’m just straight up not happy.\n\n\n",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "One of my first tasks ever was creating a script that moves folders around when a column of data (let's say C) changes. The manager who gave me the job told me that there was a rule that won't ever be broken at our company. That is column C will always be set to A or B and that we can use that logic to determine where to move folders to. Like an idiot I checked exactly A or B and didn't have any other checks. My manager was let go somewhere down the line and I completely forgot about this script. \n\n\nNot too long ago an office worker complained that they cannot find some of our files from their PC but they can through our site. So it turns out when you set column C to something other than A or B all of our projects that rely on the data still work (because I add a unique identifier file in each that we use to search instead of path thankfully) but internal office workers can't see it directly anymore because they were moved. Someone in leadership made the decision to expand the options for column C. Without my manager here to identify that went against the systems he had us design, they just went with it. \n\n\nSo what happens is if a row of data has certain settings and column C is changed to something other than A or B, an automation triggers the script that moves ALL related folders to an unrelated folder (that is not always the same as the last record). One instance was like 10 folders but another was like 10,000 folders. I.T. was able to move things back fairly quickly because we keep a history of movement but one guy was really mad because he thought one of the developers deleted some of our stuff. Dude was essentially yelling at me already when we didn't even fully know the cause yet. I at first didn't think it was related to us but after doing my research and finding the script, I realized it was me specifically so he was kind of right. I told them and fixed it of course. \n\nHow bad is this? I feel pretty bad because checking just A or B and not having a specific fallback and other checks to make is pretty egregious. I also am not a fan of getting yelled at. I also don't like the idea of defending myself by telling them to wait until we know for sure, and then confirming they were partially right. I should be sleeping right now to drive to work tomorrow but I can't sleep because I'm so bummed.",

Incredibly, I got an offer for a senior developer position for a completely different product within the same company, in an industry I have zero knowledge of. I applied for other mid-level positions, but this was the first one I received an offer for.\n\nThe selection process was easy and quick, and I think the people didn't realize that my actual developer experience is quite short. I think they saw I had a senior tier and skipped technical questions about the stack and previous technical experiences, focusing instead on behavior and logic.\n\nI know it will sound like imposter syndrome, but sometimes it's not just a syndrome, right? I'm terrified of accepting the position and ending up fired if I can't deliver what they ask for in the first few months. Financially, I should receive about a 30% increase if I accept.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation or knows of stories of similar situations? I usually learn quickly, but I know that seniority in development isn't earned overnight. I'm even considering scheduling a meeting with the manager to explain the situation and try to align expectations, possibly reducing the seniority/salary initially to reduce the risk of dismissal, but I know that might seem like a red flag to the manager.

A little background is I was enlisted for 6 years, got my bachelors in business then transitioned out into a BDR role. That company was a mess but I was recruited via linkedin to do back-end work for our sales team at a data center.   \n  \nFirst year was great! Networked well and learned a lot, then our teams got split into specific roles for different tasks. During this time I was asking heavily for SOP's since we already didn't have many and our scope of work was actually still expanding since data centers are booming with AI. Was promised some but never happened.\n\nGot a new manager that's been there for years and shes buddy buddy with our boss. Thought I was doing great, been on the team for almost a year and started showing a lot of improvement in July until now. 1 on 1s were shorter. Got some feedback on things I needed to correct but it was happening less and less. Out of the blue I get hit with this PIP last week. Still dont have SOP's but told im making too many mistakes. I currently have the second most cases managed but told my \"numbers are low\". No proof of the numbers and no verified measure of success for our team.   \n  \nHR asks me not to record the PIP but I did on my phone for my defense. I show all the improvement and the fact I do just as much as everyone else (its really not that intensive of a job we only get a few cases a week and I try to grab my fair share). But even with all my proof and documentation, the 8 mistakes I've made in the last few months apparently warrant a PIP (same mistakes my team members have and STILL are making currently). Manager is now OOO but pip gives vague KPI's which amount to \"make less mistakes and do more work\". No numbers no percentages just \"do better\".\n\nI know holidays are a terrible time to job search and I feel like linkedin doesn't even work anymore. I'm really nervous for what I'm going to do here. Any advice is appreciated.\n\n\\[Side note\\]  \n\\- I'm the only guy on my team  \n\\- I've documented a lot of the short comings of other teams and our systems (Ex: SOP's not having been updated since 2023, multi day delays in replies)  \n\\- Old manager says somebody on their team got hired that they want to throw out but they cant and his bosses boss came down on everyone hard about being able to get rid of people.

I know it's less technical, but is there a major difference in landing a job with a BA in CS instead of a BS? Looking to become a full stack web developer after graduating, and one of my goals would be to make six figures in 5-10 years. Buddy of mine minored in CS, and makes $200k+. Another majored in IT, and makes around the same. Would appreciate any input. Thanks.",

Overall I like this company, they handled corona well and do a good job to make consulting and family life possible. \nLast years we started some internal reorganization because of growth. I applied for a internal lead position and got rejected. The feedback was that it was super close, but there where concerns because I was not often enough in the office - fair enough, I have a long commute and mostly work with teams in other cities so there is not much value in being there.  But be more there, and the next position is yours. So I did just that. Was there the whole last year, at least once a week. \n\nWell the next round was this week. Guess who got rejected again?\nSo, seems I need to look for greener pastures. Shame. ",

But sometimes it’s really hard to follow their point. They speak so much that I either lose the main idea or miss what they’re actually trying to say.\n\nSometimes I wonder if they’re intentionally softening their message by wrapping it in a lot of words, or if it just comes naturally to them. Either way, it makes it difficult for me to respond or take action based on what they say.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that when others speak on the same topic, I understand them right away. But with these colleagues, even though they seem to cover everything, I still can’t tell what the key takeaway is.\n\nDoes anyone else ever feel the same way?",

        "content": "Hey folks,  \nI’m a recent CS grad working at a mid-sized consulting company in the automotive industry as a full-stack dev (Vue + Rails).\n\nIn college, I spent my last two years really focusing on **machine learning and data science**, so that’s what I’m most passionate about. Web dev has been fine, but it’s not what I was really hoping to do long-term.\n\nRecently, my company’s been dipping its toes into AI, mostly by giving non-technical employees access to tools like ChatGPT and running some basic “AI productivity” workshops. I figured that was about as far as they’d go, but the other day I overheard my manager and a director talking about getting some NVIDIA “AI-ready” PCs to run local LLMs. My manager said it could get pricey and that we don’t really have anyone who could handle that right now.\n\nThat kinda caught my attention, because, well, I *could* help with that. I’m not a pro ML engineer, but I’ve built models, done projects, and studied this stuff a lot. I’d love to contribute if they actually start working on AI internally.\n\nThe only thing is, I’m still on a **6-month trial contract**, so I don’t want to come across like I’m bored or unhappy with my current job. I just don’t want to miss a chance to get involved if this becomes a thing.\n\nSo what’s the best way to bring this up to my manager without sounding like I’m trying to ditch my role? Or should I just wait until I’m officially permanent before mentioning it?",

Though I still enjoy writing software, the specifics of my position have grown stale and I am also a bit burned out on Java which I never really liked that much.  I am in my mid fifties and I am considering quitting. I am single and probably have enough money to retire under most scenarios, but I really can't see myself doing nothing.  I'd love to find something writing C/C++ for, say, 25 or 30ish hours per week.  I'm wondering what my chances are of finding piece meal or contract work writing or maintaining C/C++.  Would my age hurt me?  Is there even demand for that?  What do you think?",
