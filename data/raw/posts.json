Most confusing shit ever.\n\nI'm more than willing to accept it's an skill issue. But I feel like documentation is pretty much useless. It doesn't help that every single tool decides to make up its own language and concepts to describe things. It doesn't help that the documentation isn't opinionated, straightforward, easy to follow, not all over the place, doesn't show clear examples, how to set it up, what's the proper project structure, what to do if you have a previous project, etc.\n\nAgain, I concede this may be a skill issue. But this is why so many are put off by the overwhelming amount of tools. They should be simple to use IMO but it seems its quite the opposite.\n\nWith that said, if anyone has a good, updated, proper guide, preferrably from someone not trying to sell me something, on how to set up and use either of them, I would appreciate it a lot.",

The ironic part is that I basically function as a manager already - I don’t write code anymore, just review PRs occasionally and give architectural recommendations (though teams aren’t obligated to follow them if their actual manager disagrees).\n\nI know this sounds crazy, but I could probably sit in this role for another 10 years without anyone noticing or caring. It’s that kind of position where I’m not really adding much value, but I’m also not bothering anyone.\n\nAfter 4 months of grinding leetcode and modern system design to get my technical skills back up to candidate standards, I now have some options to consider.\n\n\nScenario A (Current Job):\n- TC: ~$260K\n- Company: A non-tech company with an older tech stack and lower growth potential (Salesforce, Databricks, Mulesoft)\n- Role: Overseeing mostly outsourced engineering work\n- Perks: On-site child care, on-site gym, and a shorter commute\n- Drawbacks: Less exciting technical work, limited upward mobility in the near term, and no title bump (remains an individual contributor)\n\nScenario B:\n- TC: ~$210K base not including the fun money equity. \n- Company: A tech startup with a modern tech stack and real technical challenges (Kafka, Dbt, Snowflake, Flink, Docker, Kubernetes) \n- Role: Title bump to manager, includes people management responsibilities and a pathway to future leadership roles\n- Perks: Startup equity and more stimulating work\n- Drawbacks: Longer commute, no on-site child care or gym, and significantly lower cash compensation\n\nWould love to hear what you’d pick and why.",

        "content": "Continuing my latest post about vibe coding as a data engineer.\n\nin case you missed - I am trying to make a bunch of projects ASAP to show potential freelance clients demos of what I can make for them because I don't have access to former projects from my workplaces.\n\nSo, In my last demo project, I created a daily patch data on AWS using Lambda, Glue, S3 and Athena.\n\nusing this project, I created my next project, a demo BI Dashboard as an example of how to use data to show insights using your data infra.\n\nNote: I did not try to make a very insightful dashboard, as this is a simple tech demo to show potential.\n\nA few takes from the current project:\n\n1. After taking some notes from my last project, the workflow with AI felt much smoother, and I felt more in control over my prompts and my expectations of what it can provide me.\n\n2. This project was much simpler (tech wise). Much less tools, most of the project is only in python, which makes it easier for the AI to follow on the existing setup and provide better solutions and fixes.\n\n3. Some tasks just feels frustrating with AI even when you expect it to be very simple. (for example, no matter what I did, it couldn't make a list of my CSV column names, it just couldn't manage it, very weird.)\n\n4. When not using UI tools (like in AWS console for example), the workflow feels more right. you are much less likely to get hallucinations (which happened A LOT on AWS console)\n\n5. For the data visualization enthusiasts amongst us, I believe making graph settings for matplotlib and alike using AI is the biggest game changer I felt since coding with it. it saves SO MUCH time remembering what settings exists for each graph and plot type, and how to set them correctly.\n\nGithub repo: [https://github.com/roey132/streamlit\\_dashboard\\_demo](https://github.com/roey132/streamlit_dashboard_demo)\n\nStreamlit demo link: [https://dashboarddemoapp.streamlit.app/](https://dashboarddemoapp.streamlit.app/)\n\n  \nI believe this project was a lot easier to vibe code because its much smaller and less complex than the daily batch pipeline. that said, it does help me understand more about the potential and risks of vibe coding, and let's me understand better when to trust AI (in its current form) and when to doubt it's responses.\n\nto summarize:  when working on a project that doesn't have a lot of different environments and tools (this time, 90% python), the value of vibe coding is much higher. also, learning to make your prompts better and more informative can improve the final product a lot, but, still, the AI takes a lot of assumptions when providing answers, and you can't always provide it with 100% of the information and edge cases, which makes it provide very wrong solutions. Understanding what the process should look like and knowing what to expect of your final product is key to make a useful and steady app.\n\nI will continue to share my process on my next project in hope it can help anyone! \n\n(Also, if you have any cool idea to try for my next project, please let me know! i'm open for ideas)",

        "author": "deathstroke3718",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey guys. I recently completed an ETL project that I've been longing to complete and I finally have something presentable. It's an ETL pipeline and dashboard to pull, process and push the data into my dimensionally modeled Postgres database and I've used Streamlit to visualize the data.\n\n  \nThe steps:  \n1. Data Extraction: I used the Fotmob API to extract all the match ids and details in the English Premier League in nested json format using the ip-rotator library to bypass any API rate limits.\n\n2. Data Storage: I dumped all the json files from the API into a GCP bucket. (around 5k json files)\n\n3. Data Processing: I used DataProc to run the spark jobs (used 2 spark workers) of reading the data and inserting the data into the staging tables in postgres. (all staging tables are truncate and load)\n\n4. Data Modeling: This was the most fun part about the project as I understood each aspect of the data, what I have, what I do not and at what level of granularity I need to have to avoid duplicates in the future. Have dim tables (match, player, league, date) and fact tables (3 of them for different metric data for match and player, but contemplating if I need a lineup fact).  Used generate\\_series for the date dimension. Added insert, update date columns and also added sequences to the targer dim/fact tables.\n\n5. Data Loading: After dumping all the data into the stg tables, I used a merge query to insert/update if the key id exists or not. I created SQL views on top of these tables to extract the relevant information I need for my visualizations. The database is Supabase PostgreSQL.\n\n6. Data Visualization: I used Streamlit to showcase the matplotlib, plotly and mplsoccer (soccer-specific visualization) plots. There are many more visualizations I can create using the data I have.\n\nI used Airflow for orchestrating the ETL pipelines (from extracting data, creating tables, sequences if they don't exist, submitting pyspark scripts to the gcp bucket to run on dataproc, and merging the data to the final tables), Terraform to manage the GCP services (terraform apply and destroy, plan and fmt are cool) and  Docker for containerization. \n\n  \nThe Streamlit dashboard is [live here](https://pldashboard.streamlit.app/) and [Github ](https://github.com/karthikgarimella37/EPL_Fotmob)as well. I am open to any feedback, advice and tips on what I can improve in the pipeline and visualizations. My future work is to include more visualizations, add all the leagues available in the API and learn and use dbt for testing and sql work.\n\n  \nCurrently, I'm looking for any entry-level data engineering/data analytics roles as I'm a recent MS data science graduate and have 2 years of data engineering experience. If there's more I can do to showcase my abilities, I would love to learn and implement them. If you have any advice on how to navigate such a market, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you've reached this point. I appreciate it. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4mq029q72ef1.jpg?width=871&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf3e8129c1a144e78b1decf32642278afc1e24f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m13gy8q72ef1.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=526ebcad5616d0bfcb1c6e4a8357cd6833c06d97\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lj70pv8q72ef1.png?width=1601&format=png&auto=webp&s=81b2094bb13d30c8a6b33798905f128b5c88f162\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/617odx8q72ef1.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef3bb7184eb9d012de8c9979df5c0da15be80b8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c42efw8q72ef1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6660c876a1487b5c7a313afbd28b90776a7dd64\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ynyb59q72ef1.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0433856dacc83622fd06f4aa6be764e688d554a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvu3lw8q72ef1.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=646dec3a6e11b8c268fc91a196eb8ad0d149ef59\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7v98w8q72ef1.png?width=1515&format=png&auto=webp&s=16180537c5ef391bea1f73619b68c75c4763f0c7\n\n",

        "content": "After months of research and testing after i had a project to classify data into categories of a large 10m records dataset in [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1lk78ub/the_nightmare_of_de_processing_free_text_input/), and apart from that the data had many typos, what i only knew is that it comes from online forms which candidates type their degree name, but many typed some junk, typos, all sort of things that you can imagine\n\nTo get an idea, here is a sample of the data:\n\n    id, degree\n    1, technician in public relations\n    2, bachelor in business management\n    3, high school diploma\n    4, php\n    5, dgree in finance\n    6, masters in cs\n    7, mstr in logisticss\n\nSome of you suggested to use an LLM, or AI, some recommended to check Levenshtein distance\n\nI tried fuzzy matching and many things, so i came up with this plan to solve this puzzle:\n\n1. Use 3 layers of spelling corrections using words from a bag of clean words with: word2vec, 2 layers of Levenshtein distance\n2. Create a master table of all degrees out there over 600 degrees\n3. Tokenize the free text input column, the degrees column from master table, crossjoin them and creacte a match score with the amount of matching words from the text column against the master data column\n4. To this point for each row it will have many cnadidates, so we're picking the degree name in which has the highest amount of matching words against the text column\n5. The output of this method tested with a portion of 500k records, and with 600 degrees in master table, we got over 75% matching score which means we found the equivalent degree name for 75% of the text records, it can be improved by adding more degree names, modify confidence %, and train the model with more data\n\nThis method combines 2 ML models, and finds the best matching degree name against each line\n\nThe output would be like this:\n\n    id, degree\n    1, technician in public relations, degree in public relations\n    2, bachelor in business management, bachelors degree in business management\n    3, high school diploma, high school degree\n    4, php, degree in software development\n    5, dgree in finance, degree in finance\n    6, masters in cs, masters degree in computer science\n    7, mstr in logisticss, masters degree in logistics\n\nI made it as a Python library based on PySpark which doesn't require any comercial LLM AI APIs ... fully open source, so that anyone that struggles with the same issue can use the library directly to save time and headaches\n\nYou can find the library on PyPi: [https://pypi.org/project/PyNLPclassifier/](https://pypi.org/project/PyNLPclassifier/)\n\nOr install it directly\n\n`pip install pynlpclassifier`\n\nI made an [article ](https://medium.com/@hamzahbdeveloper/introducing-pynlpclassifier-correct-the-spelling-and-categorize-large-free-text-input-data-using-da1a93408f30)explainning in depth the library, the functions, and an example of use case\n\nI hope you found my research work helpfull and that can be useful to share with the community.",

        "content": "This is mostly a question for experienced engineers / leads: was there a time when you've regretted going open source instead of building something in-house, or vica versa?\n\nFor context, at work we're mostly reading different databases, and some web apis, and load them to SQL server. So we decided on writing some lightweight wrappers for extract and load, and use those for SQL server. During my last EL task I've decided to use DLT for exploration, and maybe use our in-house solution for production.\n\nHere's the kicker: DLT took around 5 minutes for a 140k row table, which was processed in 10s with our wrappers (still way too long, working on optimizing it). So as much as initially I've hated implementijg our in-house solution, with all the weird edge cases, in the end I couldn't be happier. Not to mention no breaking changes, that could break our pipelines.\n\nLooking at the code for both implementations, it's obvious that DLT simply can't perform the same optimizations as we can, because it has less information about our environments. But these results are quite weird: DLT is the fastest ingestion tool we tested, and it can be easily beat in our specific use case, by an average-at-best set of programmers.\n\nBut I still feel unease, what if a new programmer comes to our team, and they can't be productive for extra 2 months? Was the fact that we can do big table ingestions in 2 minutes vs 1 hour worth the cost of extra 2-3 hours of work when inevitably a new type of source / sink comes in? What are some war stories? Some choices that you regret / greatly appreciate in hindsight? Especially a question for open source proponents: When do you decide that the cost of integrating between different open source solutions is greater than writing your own system, which is integrated by default - as you control everything.",

        "author": "SnooDogs4383",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks, I recently joined a consultancy where we manage data solutions for clients. My team primarily works on Databricks, and I was really impressed at first with Delta Live Tables (now called Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline) and Photon. It felt super intuitive, until I saw the $200 bill just from me testing it out. That was kinda absurd.\n\nAround the same time, I was optimizing a server for another team and stumbled onto DuckDB. I got pulled into a DuckDB rabbit hole. I loved how portable it is, and the idea of single-node compute vs. distributed jobs like Spark made a lot of sense. From what the DuckDB team claims, it can outperform Spark for datasets under \\~5TB, which covers most of what we do.\n\nThat got me thinking: Why not build a data platform where DuckDB is the compute engine, with the option to later switch to Spark (or something else) via an adaptor?\n\nHere’s the rough idea:\n\n1. Everything should work locally—compute and storage.\n2. Add adaptors to connect to any external data source or platform.\n3. Include tools that help design and stress-test data models (seriously, why do most platforms not have this built-in?).  \n\nI also saw that DuckDB Foundation released a new data lake standard that seems like a cleaner way to structure metadata compared to loose files on S3.\n\nMeanwhile:\n\n* Databricks just announced **Lakeflow Connect** to integrate with lots of SaaS platforms.  \n* MotherDuck is about to announce **Estuary**, which sounds like it’ll offer similar functionality.  \n* DuckLake (MotherDuck’s implementation of the lake standard) looks promising too.  \n\nSo here’s my actual question:  \n**Is there room or real need for a local-first data lake platform?** One that starts local for speed, cost, and simplicity—but can scale to the cloud later?\n\nI know it sounds like a niche idea. But a lot of small businesses generate a fair amount of data and don’t have the tools or people to set up a proper warehouse. Maybe starting local-first makes it easier for developers to play around without worrying about getting billed every time they test something?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts. Is this just me dev dreaming, or something worth building?",

I’d love to get your thoughts, since this is our first time migrating to a modern data stack.\n\nThe idea is to use Snowpipes to load data into Snowflake from ADLS Gen2, where we land all our raw data. From there, we want to leverage dynamic tables to simplify orchestration and transformation. We’re only dealing with batch data for now so no streaming requirements.\n\nFor CI/CD, we’re planning to use either Azure DevOps or GitHub, using the Snowflake repository stage and we currently have three separate Snowflake accounts, so zero-copy cloning won’t be an option.\n\nThe files in ADLS will contain all columns from the source systems, but in Snowflake we’ll only keep the ones we actually need for reporting. Finally, for slowly changing dimensions, we're planning to use integer surrogate keys instead of hash keys.\n\nDo you think this setup is sufficient? I’m also considering using dbt, mainly for data quality testing and documentation. Since lineage is already available in Snowflake and we’re handling CI/CD externally, I'm wondering if there are still strong reasons to bring dbt into the stack. Any downsides or things I should keep in mind?\n\nAlso, I’m a bit concerned about orchestration. Without using a dedicated tool, we’re relying on dynamic tables and possibly Snowflake Tasks, but that doesn’t feel quite scalable long-term especially when it comes to backfills or more complex dependencies.\n\nSorry for the long post but any feedback would be super helpful!",

While this works, it's proving to be inefficient at scale. For example, one of our largest tables sees around 5 million change events per day, and this volume is starting to strain the system.\nGiven the upsert-heavy nature of our source systems, we’re re-evaluating our approach. We're considering switching to the Confluent S3 Sink Connector to write Avro files to S3, and then ingesting the data into Redshift via batch processes. This would involve using a mix of COPY operations for inserts and DELETE/INSERT logic for updates, which we believe may scale better.\nHas anyone taken a similar approach?

As I work in a company who is reluctant to adopt new practices, and resistant to suggestions I feel a bit stuck on how to pivot.

        "content": "I apologize in advance for my lack of expertise. I'm the sole data analyst at a small company. We explore most of our data via our source systems, and do not have a database. My ingestion experience consists of exporting CSVs from our source systems to SharePoint, then connecting to Power BI and transforming there. I got buy-in from management for a centralized data solution in AWS. We reached out to a couple of engineering teams and received two proposals. The first one proceeds with our original intent of building a warehouse in Redshift, while the second one aims for lakehouse architecture using S3/Athena/Iceberg/Glue. I had not even heard of a lakehouse before starting this project.  \n\nWe record our work across multiple cloud software and need to merge them into a single source of truth. We also need to store historical snapshots of our data, which we are not able to do currently. While structured, this internal data is not large. We do not generate even 1GB of data annually. I understand that such a data size is laughable for considering a managed warehouse. However, we plan on ingesting JSON files spanning hundreds of gigs every month. While I am sure that we will not need most of the data in those files, I still want to keep them in their original format just in case. Since I have been unable to peek inside these files, I will be exploring this data for the first time. I feel that the production data will only be a few gigs. We are also reconfiguring our Jira projects, so I worry that field deletions and schema changes would convolute a warehouse implementation.  \n\nWhile I would like to build this myself, I have no coding experience and we work with healthcare data so we would need security expertise as well. Thousands of dollars per month is out of the question at the moment, so I am looking for a cost-effective and scalable solution. I just wonder if Redshift or S3 + Athena is that solution. Oh, and we would hire an engineer to manage this solution.  \n\nThanks in advance for your time!",

My thoughts are to insert the audit record in the post-hook, but if the audit record insert fails for some reason, my audit and actual data will be out of sync.\n\nWhat is the best approach to get around this limitation.\n\nI did try to add begin transaction as the first pre-hook and commit as the last post-hook, but although it works, it is hacky and then locks the table if there is a failure due to no rollback being executed.\n\nEDIT: Some more info\n\nMy pipeline will run every 4 hours or thereabouts and the target table will grow fairly large (already >1B rows). I am trying strategies for saving on cost (minimising bytes scanned, etc).\n\nThe source data has an updated_at field and in the dbt model I use: select from source where updated_at > (select max(updated_at) from target). The select max(updated_at) from target is computed from metadata, so is quite efficient (0 bytes scanned).\n\nI want to gather stats and audit info (financial data) for each of my runs. E.g. min(updated_at), max(updated_at), sum(some_value) & rowcount of each incremental load. Each incremental load does have a unique uid, so one could query from the target table after append, but that is likely going to scan a lot of data.\n\nTo mitigate against having to scan the target table for run stats, my thoughts were to stage the increment using a separate dbt model ('staging'). This staging model will stage the increment as a new table, extract the audit info from the staged increment and write the audit log. Then another model ('append') will append the staged increment to the target table. There are a few issues with this as well, including re-staging a new increment before the previous increment was appended. But I have ways around that, but it relies on the fact that audit records for both the staging runs and append runs are correctly and reliably inserted. Hence the question.",

        "title": "Architecture Dilemma: DLT vs. Custom Framework for 300+ Real-Time Tables on Databricks",
        "author": "warleyco96",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'd love to get your opinion and feedback on a large-scale architecture challenge.\n\n**Scenario:** I'm designing a near-real-time data platform for over 300 tables, with the constraint of using **only the native Databricks ecosystem** (no external tools).\n\n**The Core Dilemma:** I'm trying to decide between using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)** and building a **Custom Framework**.\n\nMy initial evaluation of DLT suggests it might struggle with some of our critical data manipulation requirements, such as:\n\n1. **More Options of Data Updating on Silver and Gold tables:**\n   1. **Full Loads:** I haven't found a native way to do a Full/Overwrite load in Silver. I can only add a TRUNCATE as an operation at position 0, simulating a CDC. In some scenarios, it's necessary for the load to always be full/overwrite.\n   2. **Partial/Block Merges:** The ability to perform complex partial updates, like deleting a block of records based on a business key and then inserting the new block (no primary-key at row level).\n2. **Merge for specific columns:** The environment tables have metadata columns used for lineage and auditing. Columns such as first\\_load\\_author and update\\_author, first\\_load\\_author\\_external\\_id and update\\_author\\_external\\_id, first\\_load\\_transient\\_file, update\\_load\\_transient\\_file, first\\_load\\_timestamp, and update\\_timestamp. For incremental tables, for existing records, only the update columns should be updated. The first\\_load columns should not be changed.\n\nMy perception is that DLT doesn't easily offer this level of granular control. Am I mistaken here? I'm new to this resource. I couldn't find any real-world examples for product scenarios, just some basic educational examples.\n\nOn the other hand, I considered a model with one continuous stream per table but quickly ran into the \\~145 execution context limit per cluster, making that approach unfeasible.\n\n**Current Proposal:** My current proposed solution is the reactive architecture shown in the image below: a central \"router\" detects new files and, via the Databricks Jobs API, triggers small, ephemeral jobs (using `AvailableNow`) for each data object.\n\n**My Question for the Community:** What are your thoughts on this event-driven pattern? Is it a robust and scalable solution for this scenario, or is there a simpler or more efficient approach within the Databricks ecosystem that I might be overlooking?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znq1swylp3ef1.png?width=5661&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f7a4d4ac35f7803c4aa1576a7f70d5cc641429a\n\nThe architecture above illustrates the Oracle source with AWS DMS. This scenario is simple because it's CDC. However, there's user input in files, SharePoint, Google Docs, TXT files, file shares, legacy system exports, and third-party system exports. These are the most complex writing scenarios that I couldn't solve with DLT, as mentioned at the beginning, because they aren't CDC, some don't have a key, and some have partial merges (delete + insert).\n\nThanks in advance for any insights or experiences you can share!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm working on a project where I'm building a chatbot that can answer questions from scanned infrastructure project documents (think government-issued construction certificates, with financial tables, scope of work, and quantities executed). I have around 100 PDFs, each corresponding to a different project.\n\nI want to build a chatbot which lets users ask questions like:\n\n* “Where have we built toll plazas?”\n* “Have we built a service road spanning X m?”\n* “How much earthwork was done in 2023?”\n\nThese documents are scanned PDFs with non-standard table formats, which makes this harder than a typical document QA setup.\n\n# Current Pipeline (working for one doc):\n\n1. **OCR**: I’m using Amazon Textract to extract raw text (structured as best as possible from scanned PDFs). I’ve tried Google Vision also but Textract gave the most accurate results for multi-column layouts and tables.\n2. **Parsing**: Since table formats vary a lot across documents (headers might differ, row counts vary, etc.), regex didn’t scale well. Instead, I’m using ChatGPT (GPT-4) with a prompt to parse the raw OCR text into a structured JSON format (split into sections like salient\\_feature, scope of work, financial burification table, quantities executed table, etc.)\n3. **QA**: Once I have the structured JSON, I pass it back into ChatGPT and ask questions like:The chatbot processes the JSON and returns accurate answers.“Where did I construct a toll plaza?” “What quantities were executed for Bituminous Concrete in 2023?”\n\n# Challenges I'm facing:\n\n1. **Scaling to multiple documents**: What’s the best architecture to support 100+ documents?\n   * Should I store all PDFs in S3 (or similar) and use a trigger (like S3 event or Lambda) to run Textract + JSON pipeline as soon as a new PDF is uploaded?\n   * Should I store all final JSONs in a directory and load them as knowledge for the chatbot (e.g., via LangChain + vector DB)?\n   * What’s a clean, production-grade pipeline for this?\n2. **Inconsistent table structures** Even though all documents describe similar information (project cost, execution status, quantities), the tables vary significantly in headers, table length, column allignment, multi-line rows, blank rows etc. Textract does an okay job, but still makes mistakes — and ChatGPT sometimes hallucinates or misses values when prompted to structure it into JSON. Is there a better way to handle this step?\n3. **JSON parsing via LLM: how to improve reliability?** Right now I give ChatGPT a single prompt like: “Convert this raw OCR text into a JSON object with specific fields: \\[project\\_name, financial\\_bifurcation\\_table, etc.\\]”. But this isn't 100% reliable when formats vary across documents. Sometimes certain sections get skipped or misclassified.\n   * Should I chain multiple calls (e.g., one per section)?\n   * Should I fine-tune a model or use function calling instead?\n\n# Looking for advice on:\n\n* Has anyone built something similar for scanned docs with LLMs?\n* Any recommended open-source tools or pipelines for structured table extraction from OCR text?\n* How would you architect a robust pipeline that can take in a new scanned document → extract structured JSON → allow semantic querying over all projects?\n\nThanks in advance — this is my first real-world AI project and I would really really appreciate any advice yall have as I am quite stuck lol :)\n\n",

They use SSIS - with some additional third-party connectors - to ingest the data to SQL Server in an ETL approach.  The primary customer are BI analysts using a phenomenally busy on-premise Tableau Server.\n\nFrom what I have seen it's functioning well and people have made good use of the data.  For a public sector organisation I am impressed by what they've achieved!\n\nThe limitations are no distinction between dev and prod, no CI/CD setup or version control, no clarity on dependencies, no lineage visibility outside of the handful of developers, and data models that only exist within Tableau.\n\nTheir budget for new licensing is the square root of zero.  They have explored cloud (Azure) but their data sources are so broad and their usage is so high that the costs would be beyond their budget.  They started looking at dbt Core but have cold feet due to the growing divide between Core and Cloud.\n\nI have read some very good things about SQL Mesh and I think it would tackle a lot of their current limitations.  My thinking is to retain SSIS but as EL and implement SQL Mesh as the T.\n\nHas anyone tackled anything similar before or have any thoughts beyond my limited thinking?  The team seem up for the challenge but I don't want to lead them in the wrong direction as it's a big overhaul!",

        "author": "sumant28",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "This seems like it should be a really basic pattern but I have been struggling to figure out what is ideal rather than just what will work. To my surprise I do not really see an existing solution that entirely answers this post but from ChatGPT I have a strong hunch what I need to do but I have further issues to clarify.\n\n\nIf there is a daily ingest of about 1MB of data in JSON is it best to partition that data in the raw or bronze folder from the date as a string or instead to partition by year, month and day. All this time I was doing the latter approach thinking that was optimal but I have since found out that only is best for huge data systems which often further partition into hours and minutes and deal with petabytes or terabytes of data.\n\n\nThe issue I have learned is that partition trees grow too large with calendar partitions rather than the simple flat structure of date strings. However my issue is that in terms of queries I have nothing ad hoc. The only thing the data is used for is to create dashboards filtering at different levels of time granularity. For example some dashboards would be by week, some by fortnight, some by month, some by year.\n\n\nFor these queries that power these dashboards I do not know if the earlier partition even allows any benefits of partitions at all. I read that the partition still helps but I was not able to understand why. My most important dashboard is by week and I do not see how a partition by date string allows the query engine to speed up filtering by the current week or the previous week.\n\n\nI have some other questions specific to AWS. For the etl job that transforms the bronze layer to parquet I learned that bookmarks also need to be used. I read that it is best practice to have as a source the crawled data catalog table rather than the JSON files. Is this still true? That means for job bookmarking in order to process only incremental data you have to rely on a key which is a column of data or field rather than the easier to understand bookmarking by file. If you are bookmarking by key that points to using date string rather than using a trio of date partitions like year, month and day which are all also nested. For reducing complexity is that the right assumption?",

Their inventory data was spread across 3 different databases, production schedules were in Excel sheets that people were emailing around, and quality control metrics were...well, let's just say they existed somewhere.\n\nThe real kicker? Leadership kept asking for \"real-time visibility\" into operations while we are sitting on data that's 2-3 days old by the time anyone sees it. Classic, right?\n\n**The main headaches we ran into:**\n\n* ERP system from early 2000s that basically spoke a different language than everything else\n* No standardized data formats between production, inventory, and quality systems\n* Manual processes everywhere where people were literally copy-pasting between systems\n* Zero version control on critical reports (nightmare fuel)\n* Compliance requirements that made everything 10x more complex\n\n**What broke during migration:**\n\n* Initial pipeline kept timing out on large historical data loads\n* Real-time dashboards were too slow because we tried to query everything live\n\n**What actually worked:**\n\n* Staged approach with data lake storage first\n* Batch processing for historical data, streaming for new stuff\n\nWe ended up going with Azure for the modernization but honestly the technical stack was the easy part. The real challenge was getting buy-in from operators who have been doing things the same way for 15+ years.\n\n**What I am curious about:** For those who have done similar manufacturing data consolidations, how did you handle the change management aspect? Did you do a big bang migration or phase it out gradually?\n\nAlso, anyone have experience with real-time analytics in manufacturing environments? We are looking at implementing live dashboards but worried about the performance impact on production systems.\n\nWe actually documented the whole journey in a whitepaper if anyone's interested. It covers the technical architecture, implementation challenges, and results. Happy to share if it helps others avoid some of the pitfalls we hit.",

My application (which is hosted somewhere else) has a couple of sql to fetch a data from that, or it sends a couple of request/post/get into a server and get the data back either in csv or json format. I only do light development (not full-stack) like that for business need (quite adhoc and change constantly)\n\nI really want to learn more about the data perspective (how to build a database, how all the threading, concurrency etc.. work behind the scene). Try a couple of investigation online and come across this course from CMU which is like golden source on how to start to understand database at very deep level [https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2025/](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2025/) I spent a couple of days to deep dive the course material, but, to be honest it's way above my level, tackling this is not efficient yet.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on how to start properly and slowly gain knowledge required.

Learning C++ (still struggle with intermediate concept like lvalue/rvalue,  how to use smart pointers properly etc.). Write SQL on daily basis but i guess it's not useful yet (work comfortably with CTE for example or stored procedure).\n\n  \nReally appreciate your help!",

I don't think the compute/data requirements would be too high as tbh they haven't digitized a lot of their processes (yet), and as far as I can tell, the useful data in their db as far as analytics goes is probably <1-10GB (if that).\n\nAny recommendations for the best way to go about this?

        "author": "planesforstars",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Last year, I found myself in a familiar cycle: I'd watch a tutorial, follow along perfectly, feel like a programming genius... then completely freeze when faced with a blank editor and a real problem to solve. I knew the syntax. I could explain concepts. But I couldn't *build* anything meaningful without a step-by-step guide.\n\nSound familiar? I've come to call this the competent imposter phase - where you understand enough to recognize good code, but not enough to produce it independently.\n\n# The Gap No One Talks About\n\nI've noticed a pattern in programming education that no one seems to address directly: there's a massive cognitive leap between understanding code and generating it. It's like knowing all the rules of chess but having no strategic intuition. You know how the pieces move, but you can't see the patterns that make a good player.\n\nAfter months of frustration, I decided to approach this problem systematically. Here's what I discovered works:\n\n# 1. Reverse Engineering > Tutorials\n\nInstead of watching more tutorials, I started downloading open-source projects that were *just* beyond my skill level. Not massive frameworks, but small utilities with 300-1000 lines of code.\n\nThe process: Run the program to understand what it does Read through the code without judgment Delete small sections and try to reimplement them Gradually expand what I deleted until I could recreate substantial portions\n\nThis forced me to think like the original developer rather than just consuming their finished work.\n\n# 2. The Tiny Feature Technique\n\nOne of my breakthroughs came when I stopped trying to build complete applications. Instead, I focused on adding tiny features to existing code:\n\n* Take a simple calculator app and add a history feature Add dark mode to a static website Implement a simple search function in a list app\n\nThis approach gave me the scaffolding to work within while still requiring creative problem-solving.\n\n# 3. Deliberate Debugging Practice\n\nI started intentionally breaking working code, then fixing it. This might sound counterproductive, but it taught me to read error messages properly and understand how the pieces fit together.\n\nI'd introduce a bug, wait 24 hours (so I'd forget exactly what I changed), then come back and fix it. This simulated the real-world experience of debugging unfamiliar code.\n\n# 4. The Explain It To A Beginner Test\n\nAfter implementing something, I forced myself to write an explanation as if teaching it to someone who just started coding. This revealed gaps in my understanding that weren't apparent when I was just following along with tutorials.\n\nIf I couldn't explain a concept clearly, I knew I needed to revisit it.\n\n# 5. Embracing Uncomfortable Tools\n\nI noticed I was avoiding certain technologies because they felt intimidating. For me, this was working with APIs and asynchronous code.\n\nSo I created a rule: at least once a week, I'd work on something that made me uncomfortable. Not to master it immediately, but to reduce the anxiety around it.\n\n# The Mental Shift That Changed Everything\n\nThe biggest change came when I stopped thinking of programming as knowing things and started seeing it as figuring things out.\n\nExperienced developers aren't successful because they've memorized everything - they're successful because they've developed robust mental models for approaching new problems. They know how to break down complex tasks, research effectively, and test their assumptions.\n\n# My Practical Advice\n\n1. **Create a Learning Project** \\- A single, evolving project you keep enhancing as you learn new concepts. Mine was a personal book tracking app that grew from a command-line tool to a web app over 6 months.\n2. **Code Review Yourself** \\- After completing something, wait a week, then review your own code as if it was written by someone else. Be critical but constructive.",

        "author": "peterlinddk",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I don't know if this will reach those who need it the most, but I've seen a lot of posts from people being confused as to which programming language to choose, asking how long it will take to learn something, asking when you'll have learned enough to learn more or get a job. But unfortunately those questions can't really be answered - but fortunately it doesn't really matter!\n\nRemember that a programming language is *a language* \\- and just like other languages created by humans, they are used to convey ideas to other humans. The computer doesn't care about the language you program it in, it only understands machine code, so the moment your program compiles you are basically free to throw away the source code. Except you don't do that, because you might want to change things later, or have someone else look at the code, another human, or a large language model, that also (tries to) understand language.\n\nSo learning a programming language is a lot like learning any other language - there are syntax rules, grammar, different classes of words: verbs, nouns, adjectives and so on, and there are all the words in the language. A lot of them added by other humans, and in most cases still being added.\n\nIf you managed to learn English (or whatever other secondary language you learnt) by reading the definition of the grammar and syntax, committing all the special cases to memory, and memorizing every single word, well, then maybe that will also work for you when learning programming! - But most of us didn't learn it that way, we picked up a few words, understood the sentence-structure, partly, tried to use the language, spoke and wrote, and made a lot of mistakes. And gradually we got better and better, learned more \"rules\" and even more exceptions to those rules, and picked up a lot of new words as we went along.\n\nNobody has ever \"completed\" learning English - for one the language always changes, and always has, and also there are simply to many words, to many dialects even, to ever learn everything.\n\nSame goes for programming - you will probably never complete any language, there will always be something new to learn, or something that *you* use so rarely that you forget about it, and have to look it up on the rare occasions that you *do* need it.\n\nBut that shouldn't discourage you from learning other languages - if you have to travel to France or Spain, you'll probably need to learn some French or Spanish, and you might even like it so much that you decide to stay and learn more - while still keeping your English, maybe forgetting a bit more than before, but never mind, you still know how to look it up!\n\n\n\nThere are some grammar rules that you'll never understand, but somehow manage to use anyways. A lot of languages have gendered words, with very unspecific rules about why a specific word is one gender, but you'll get used to it \"sounding wrong\" when you use the wrong one. Same in programming, you might not be able to fully comprehend async or lambdas or closure, but just use it to write code where it \"sounds right\". A number of books and blogposts will try to invent rules to remember, but often they are even more difficult to understand, and also quite often simply wrong. So you'll get by and just \"do programming\" always feeling that you don't fully understand everything.\n\nLike you don't fully understand everything in the languages you write or speak - like you haven't meticulously memorized every single word, but somehow still use them. \n\n  \nAnd some people find it easy to adapt to new languages, while others keep talking the dialect of their hometown even after having lived everywhere else their entire life. Sometimes you hear or read a word, and immediately understand it, other times you'll struggle your entire career with the spelling or pronouncination of some. The experience is different for everyone, and there is no set speed for how anything takes anyone else to learn.\n\nI hope that those of you fixating on languages will read and understand this - and maybe stop worrying so much, and get going using the languages - the programming languages - to actually build something. Not important original masterpieces, just small stories where you use the language as you are learning.",

I went through psychological therapy and recently surgery so I cant physically move excessively at the moment.\n\nPlease dont delete this I just want to ask for an advice. \nI dont have any Exp in computer science.\nI play games as a hobby.\nI just need something as a leisure like me learning Japanese at the moment.\nThank u \\.( ^_^ )./ \n\nEdit : Hey guys Just wanting to update you. First off, Thanks for all of the help you guys provided. I'm still reading a lot of them and very sorry if I can't reply on all of it.\n\nSecond, I decided to stick to C# and check the waters again and probably give it a week and if not I'm switching to Python and if that still sucks like someone commented just stick with C.\n\nNow the IDE, I can't use VStudio cause I'm using Mint. I used jetbrains before but my oh my that IDE is so laggy in my Computer ( I told you computer is ass! ). A lot of people commented on Vim & Neovim. Now, I know those two are good and maybe you can also include LazyVim but I am just a beginner. I don't even know how to use a library let alone customising Vim to make it in a IDE. So Im at VS code at the moment.\n\nA lot of you guys are too good for me xD.\nVim is nice cause you don't really need to use a mouse whenever you code. It will be a lot faster just using the keyboard but it has steep learning curve y' know just like playing Dark souls. It takes a while and I just want to learn a language before I can jump to Vim.\n\nI know this edit is a long ass speech of drama but I really appreciate the help! \n",

        "content": "If you're a complete beginner who's just started programming or are about to begin your journey, please go through this first (This really helped me put things into perspective):\n\nWhat is programming?\n\n- I know you kinda know what it is but I bet most don't. We all know the bookish definition. But have you actually ever thought about it a bit deeper?\n\nA computer is a really dumb machine when it comes to doing things human can do and understand. If you say to a human - Go fetch me that pen 🖊️ that's over there on the table! \n\nThey will gladly go and bring it to you. \n\nBut to a computer (machine) you'd need to break that instruction into steps. Steps that may look like the following:\n\nStep 1: Hey computer! Get up, if you're sitting.\nStep 2: Now locate the table.\nStep 3: Identify something that looks like a pen 🖊️ \nStep 4: Head over to the table\nStep 5: Pick up the pen\nStep 6: Locate the person\nStep 7: Head over to the person with the pen\nStep 8: Give the pen to the person\nStep 9: Wait for further instructions.\nStep 10: If no instructions given go back to where you were earlier. \n\nI may have missed a few steps here but you get the idea. Right?\n\nTo a computer you would need to tell it the exact steps it would have to perform to complete the task.\n\nAnd that right there is programming. \n\nThe instruction I have written use English language which a computer doesn't understand so humans built programming languages like C, Python etc.\n\nSo every time you sit down to write a program just remember that you're telling a computer what it needs to do to complete a task. That's it. \n\nHence, learning programming is more about developing your ability to break a problem into steps & convert those steps into code. \n\nNote: I know this is super basic stuff but strangely none of my teachers back in college explained it to me this way. And knowing this now makes things a bit easier. \n",

Looking for advice on the best next step in my programming journey.\n\n**Background:** 37 y/o attorney with a Bachelors from Duke but in a non-STEM field. Spent the last 3 years doing MIT's undergrad Computer Science curriculum as well as the Odin Project. I would say I have an intermediate-level understanding of a lot of the concepts you would typically learn in an undergrad CS curriculum like OOP, DSA (basic concepts like DFS, BFS, linked lists, etc. as well as some slightly more advanced concepts like skip lists, VEB trees, linear programming, etc.), basic hardness proofs, discrete math, basic computer architecture, etc. Unfortunately because I went the entirely self-taught route, aside from portfolio projects I don't have any sort of credential to demonstrate this knowledge (for this reason, I'd recommend people avoid going that route if they can help it).\n\n**Goals:** At a minimum, I'd like to be able to sit for the patent bar and potentially leverage that to work more with clients in the tech industry. The dream scenario would be to make a career switch to software engineering but given my age and the state of the market I know that is extremely unlikely, so more focused on how I could leverage this for my law practice.\n\n**Path I'm Considering:** Am I crazy for thinking that Western Governors University is a logical next step for me? It's inexpensive, it seems like I might be able to grind through the curriculum pretty quick, and then I would at least have the Bachelors in CS box checked. The downside is that some of the stuff I read elsewhere on Reddit makes it sound like a diploma mill. But other online bachelors are much more expensive and might take me over 2 years to finish, and at the end of the day they are still online degrees so not sure they would even carry that much more weight anyway. \n\nI'm also really intrigued by Georgia Tech's OMSCS, but surprisingly it sounds like it would *not* be enough for me to sit for the patent bar because it's a Masters not a Bachelors. However, if I could knock out WGU in the next 6-9 months I could apply to GT in the Spring if I decide I want to go that route, so that's maybe another benefit of taking the WGU path.\n\nFor those who have gone to WGU or who are knowledgeable about the various options for an online bachelors in CS, is WGU really so much worse than other online programs that it is worth the extra time and money to do another program? Or am I right for thinking that it makes sense for someone in my position?\n\n",

How likely is it that they will give me some leetcode problem (its not a multi million company its a smaller company)... how do I prepare for it now? Will they even ask me some technical questions again if they already asked me some? Or do they just wanna get to know me personal.\n\nWhat should I learn in .NET to be fully prepared for the job in general. I still believe Im not ready for a programming job. I have absolutely no self confidence and I am very scared ill get a hard logic problem to solve and that I will completely get stuck at solving it... \n\nAny advice? Thank you! ",

I am posting here to ask how I should tackle this large project I have envisioned. My goal is to create a desktop-based application that is a dictionary for my Indigenous language. However I would like this to be more than just a dictionary, for example I would like to include all the conjugation tables for all verbs, which we have quite a lot in Cree. (In fact, around 85% of “words” in Cree are verbs). This would literally require tens of thousands of entries.\n\nNow every word can have quite a number of connections to other concepts. For example I envision this dictionary to include a section for synonyms and antonyms for each entry,  each entry having a section for “semantic field” for related entries, a section for each entry showing all other entries from the root of that word. As well as relationships between words that mean the same, for example the same verb, just simply having a different gender for the object.\n\nI will just give some examples below:\n\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᓐ (aahkwaatin) means “it is fierce, harmful”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᓰᐤ (aahkwaatisiiu) means “s/he is fierce, harmful”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᔅᑲᑎᓐ (aahkwaaskatin) means “it is frozen very solid”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑎᔕᒻ (aahkwaatisham) means “s/he cuts it badly, seriously”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑲᒥᑌᐤ (aahkwaakamiteu) means “it is painfully hot liquid”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑌᔨᒣᐤ (aahkwaateyimeu) means “s/he thinks s/he is harmful, dangerous”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᓯᓈᑯᓐ (aahkwaasinaakun) means “it looks dangerous, harmful”\nᐋᐦᐧᑳᑖᐦᑲᓴᒻ (aahkwaataahkasam) means “s/he burns it badly”\n\nYou can see the pattern. Certain parts of the word mean certain things and this can be applied to all other words, this complex connectedness is what I would like to show and be able to interact with in my dictionary. To be able to categorize, display and filter through such related roots and terms.\n\nMy question is which programming language should I learn to attempt such a project? As well as any tips or references that you all may have on how I should approach such a complex project.\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to read through this and helping me keep my language alive and flourishing.\n\nAlso, if this language interests you, feel free to PM me to learn more about it! I am clearly passionate about my language and willing to share my knowledge with others.",

        "content": "**NOTE:** I made that post in r/Unicode as well, but as that community is both small and not programming related, I'm posting here to have more chances to get an answer.\n\nI am trying to implement code for Unicode and, I was just checking the [available codes](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/) and while everything was going well, when I reached to the 4-byte codes, things started pissing me off. So, I would expect that the latest codes will not be defined, as Unicode has not yet used all the available numbers for the 4-byte range. So for now, I'll just check the latest available one and update my code in new Unicode versions.\n\nNow, here is the bizarre thing... For some reason, there are undefined codes BETWEEN sets! For some reason, the people who design and implement Unicode decided to leave some codes empty and then, continue normally! For example, the codes between [adlam](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#adlam) and [indic-siyaq-numbers](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#indic-siyaq-numbers) are not defined. What's even more crazy is that in some sets themselves, there are undefined codes. One example is the set [ethiopic-extended-b](https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#ethiopic-extended-b) which has about 3 codes not defined.\n\nBecause of that, what would be just a simple \"start/end\" range check, it will now have to be done with an array that has different ranges. That means more work for me to implement and worse performance to the programs that will use that code.\n\nWith all that in mind, unless there is a reason that they implemented it that way and someone knows and can tell me, I will have my code consider the undefined codes as valid and just be done with it and everyone that has a problem can just complain to the Unicode organization to fix their mess...",

I’m a junior dev currently learning backend web development and building my own authentication system for a project.\n\nHere’s some context:\n\n* I’m building a **signup/login flow** using Supabase.\n* I use Supabase's **Auth Management HTTP API**, not their frontend SDK.\n* The flow is:\n   1. The **client** sends an HTTP request to **my server** with credentials.\n   2. My server does validation/processing.\n   3. Then it makes an HTTP request to Supabase (signup/login endpoint).\n   4. If Supabase returns a JWT, the **server should send it back to the client**.\n\nThis is the high level design of how things would work, removing the additional steps and etc..\n\nNow here’s where I’m stuck:\n\n>\n\nI thought I would need correlation IDs or session tracking or something, but now I’m learning maybe the HTTP protocol handles that automatically — but I’m not 100% sure how.\n\nCan someone explain this? Does each HTTP request automatically maintain its response pipe or connection, even if there are multiple users? Do I need to manually track which request came from who?\n\n  \nThank you in advance",

I’ve been programming for about two years and just started my first job as a backend developer a couple of weeks ago. They put me on a project where I have to **build everything from scratch**, completely on my own, and here’s the kicker:\n\n* The requirements were explained in a super vague way;\n* There’s no clear architecture or technical guidelines;\n* There’s no testing setup or staging environment;\n* **Deadline: three weeks.**\n\nIn the last couple of days, the anxiety has completely taken over. I feel like I’m writing terrible, unstructured code because I have no idea if I’m even heading in the right direction. I can’t properly test anything, which makes me feel even worse. I’ve been so stressed that I’ve cried and even started doubting if I made the right career choice.\n\n**My main questions:**\n\n1. How do you approach projects with unclear requirements when you’re working solo?\n2. How do you make something at least *somewhat* testable when you don’t have any infrastructure or environment to rely on?\n3. If you’ve experienced this kind of anxiety or burnout early in your career, how did you handle it and regain some confidence?\n\nAny advice, personal stories, or even just “this is normal, breathe” would mean a lot.

In 2023, I completed CS50 Python and in 2024 finished CS50x, though I could only do one real project for each — both were course finals — since school kept me busy. After graduating, I finally had time and built around 8 projects. For the first few, I had clear ideas but rushed the process, using ChatGPT a lot for code (though I understood the logic). Later, I changed my approach: I'd plan the project, share my thought process with ChatGPT, ask for feedback on my logic, request pseudocode if needed, and then code it step-by-step. If stuck, I'd ask for guidance — not code — especially with library functions. I even added “No code dump, just guide me” to my prompts. It helped me learn a lot, but I’m wondering: **am I on the right path?** Is there a better way to balance learning and coding with AI support? Should I continue this approach?",

I watched an AI agent, part of an internally built tool our company is piloting, take in a small Jira ticket. It was the kind of task that would usually take me or a teammate about an hour. Mostly writing a SQL query and making a small change to some backend code.\n\nThe AI read through our codebase, figured out the context, wrote the query, updated the code, created a PR with a clear diff and a well-written description, and pushed it for review. All in just a few minutes.\n\nThis wasn’t boilerplate. It followed our naming conventions, made logical decisions, and even updated a test. One of our senior engineers reviewed the PR and said it looked solid and accurate. They would have done it the same way.\n\nWhat really hit me is that this isn’t some future concept. This AI tool is being gradually rolled out across teams in our org as part of a pilot program. And it’s already producing results like this.\n\nI’ve been following AI developments, but watching it do my job in my codebase made everything feel real in a way headlines never could. It was a ticket I would have knocked out before lunch, and now it’s being done faster and with less effort by a machine.\n\nI’m not saying engineers will be out of jobs tomorrow. But if an AI can already handle these kinds of everyday tickets, we’re looking at serious changes in the near future. Maybe not in years, but in months.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar? What are you doing to adapt? How are you thinking about the future of our field?",

But bro, this one totally broke me.\n\nHere’s how it went:\n\n1. **HR call** – pretty standard.\n2. **Online assessment** – did well - JavaScript, node.js, SQL questions and 2 LeetCode questions\n3. **Home Assignment** – spent DAYS on this. I built a full-stack review dashboard for customer reviews approval by manager and integrated it with their main website to match the UI/UX (not their production app, just matched exact same UI and CSS and made a separate page to show it working).. Added other features also. Discussed it in-depth with the CTO (1-hour technical discussion).\n4. **Follow-up Round** –  1-hour technical with the CTO. For this round, he asked me to implement OpenAI API for text analysis of reviews and auto-suggestions based on customer feedback. I thought it went well as he was happy with my work and told me to prepare for next round.\n5. **Final Boss The CEO Round** – I was asked a system design question (LLD) around 3rd-party APIs. I started explaining my thought process.... then he just abruptly ended it with a \"have a nice day\" after 15 minutes. No feedback. No explanation. Just gone.\n\nNo idea what went wrong. After the interview, I was sitting on my chair, totally numb and thinking that I just spent 20+ hours building a working AI tool for you and in just 15 minutes got a sweet rejection.\n\nI am so much drained and frustrated. That home assignment alone took so many days. I researched and studied so many things for the assessment. Today, I feel burned out and feel like leaving the software industry. Don't know when this cycle of unemployment will end. 😭😭😭😫\n\nAnyway, just needed a place to vent this out.\n\nThanks for reading. Back to the grind 😒",

Because I wanted to move up. \n\nNow, I find myself working hard and I stop short and think to myself, what's the point? Last time I did that, what did it result in? I got lots of accolades, denied for a raise because it just wasn't in the budget even though we had record profits, meets expectations and not exceptional or above average. Just got given an average rating because of the stacked ranking is basically designed so you can never be exceeds expectations....\n\n\nAnd the worst part is that you will get laid off at any time for literally no reason other than, the shareholders need more money, or the executives need a little bit extra for themselves. So like, what's the point of working hard anymore?\n\n\n**Here's a typical scenario, the one my co-worker experienced last year at Microsoft:**\n\nWorking at Microsoft, work his ass off every single day of his life, glued to his computer like a literal servant. Login early, skip lunch, stay late to help people out and be a \" team player \". Commended and received plenty of accolades, recognition, got an award. Recently got laid off, even though he was told several times that his program that he was a part of was absolutely essential, like one of the most important things in the company. Working on co-pilot and other AI tools that would be making millions of dollars. All of his hard work, working himself to the point of near exhaustion, he was rewarded with unemployment.

Remember that software is written for people using a human readable language. It will forever serve humans and will require human operators. AI will never fully replace you.\n\nExperienced folks also tend to lose motivation and become bitter over time. New grads will always deliver a wave of fresh energy and competition. With a good blend of naïveté and starry eyed optimism, you’re a hot commodity. Like a vampire, company needs annual new blood to keep innovating. FANG will always have new grad hiring programs. \n\nLastly, this is still a golden age for software. The responsibility for a software engineer would evolve to take on more breadth. CEOs won’t suddenly add “prompting software to do shit” on their schedules.  It will still be you bringing that software to life.\n\nIf you love the field, love the course work, you should still be very excited about the prospects of this career. \n\n",

        "content": "Long story short, I just couldn't take it anymore.\n\nI worked at a small startup, so things had to be fast-paced. I worked hard. Really hard. Always put up with long nights, long code reviews, etc. The whole nine yards. But, in the real world, working hard doesn't mean jack shit if it doesn't produce good results. Or, at least, the results your boss wants in the timely manner that they please. So I was always on the disappointing end of my boss. There was never a time when I was good enough for him. I always felt... mediocre. And this isn't to pin anything on my boss or whatever. I'm just saying that I wasn't able to live up to his expectations.\n\nI lost a lot of sleep over the fact that I was just never good enough; I was never off of work mode, due to the anxiety and the constant self-deprecation. There were even nights when I'd run to the toilet for a quick vomit session due to the stress.\n\nThere was always something to complain about. Something to say about my not being good at this or that. \"Why did you do it like this?\" and \"You definitely had AI write up this code, didn't you?\" (no, I didn't). Despite it all, I still tried. I tried my darnedest. I grit my teeth and took everything as feedback and always thanked him. I always tried applying what I was told. I always admitted when I fell short, never pushing back or disrespecting my boss due to my feelings or ego being hurt. I always took everything on the chin. But it always ate at me. So, of course, I snapped. I told my boss that I was quitting cold turkey. Why? It was the only way out of the intense burnout that I could see.\n\nTo my surprise, he didn't want me to quit. But of course. It costs money to find, hire, and train a new engineer, and it's risky when you don't really know what that new engineer could be capable of (or not), as opposed to the engineer that you already have and are familiar with. So I'm not surprised. But I've known my boss for a while now. Me revoking my quitting was not going to solve anything for *me*. Maybe it would've in the short-term at my job, but I know that things would've just gone back to how they always were. That's how life rolls. So I doubled down and told him that I was not open to changing my mind.\n\nI'm going to be moving back in with my parents as soon as possible. Don't know when that is yet. I'm still... going through the motions. But, for now, I'm jobless. I'm in a weird place right now, emotionally, where I feel very relaxed and liberated in that I no longer have to put up with the stress that I did at work. But, at the same time, I'm afraid of whether or not I'll get work at all anytime soon. I'm afraid of whether or not this was a good call.\n\nBut, the way things were, I knew the one answer that I needed at the time: A break from work. A long break. A few months would be nice.\n\nRegardless, this is where I'm at right now.\n\nHow's *your* work life? lol\n\n---\n\nUpdate: Hey! This post was originally meant for me to just relieve myself of some negative energy. I honestly didn't think it was going to get anywhere, but here we are, over 300 upvotes later lol. I've read through most of the responses, and I just want to thank you all. Like, really. In times like this, realistic advice is always the best advice, and a lot of you took the time to write up thoughtful and helpful responses. I really appreciate that. Thank you.\n\nAnd for those who thought this post was AI-generated... No, it was not lol",

        "author": "Broad-Cranberry-9050",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey all,\n\nIm 7 YOE. I have worked in the defense industry my first few years (RTX, Lockheed Martin, BAE, etc), then during the hiring height of 2020-2022 I went to FAANG-level company and spent a few years there in their cloud based system. THis year I got laid off and after a few months I was able to get a job in a big tech cloud based system. I wouldnt consider my current company FAANG level but id say most people would know it. I will pre-face this that it is my experience. Im not saying every project in each industry is like this, I've known people in AWS who claim to not have to do anything past 5 pm and get great reviews and bonuses.  I know people in defense who say they work a shitload of hours to get things done.\n\nHere are some of the differences I've seen from all three jobs:\n\n# Onboarding:\n\nDefense - didnt really have an onboarding. It was just kind of, build and run the system. I remember they gave me a task to change the headers of a few files just as an excuse to get me to build.\n\nFAANG - they bascially gave me an onboarding doc, that didnt even seem official. It was just a doc that got passed around with steps. I was surpriused nobody had ever took time to put it in a version control style doc system. It was just in the middle of some doc sharing system online.\n\nCurrent: to my surprise their onboarding was the best and most chill. They gave me clear indiciation of where they expect me to be. The first week was just 3 hour courses each day of onboarding for my company. The second week was a self paced class for onboarding for my team. The videos were very instructive, and easy to follow along and my favorite part was they basically gave us guidelines for how to get promoted.\n\n# work life balance:\n\nDefense - probably had the best work life balance of the bunch. I never had to think about work after 5pm. By 6 the building was a ghost town with a few stragglers. They worked on a 9/80 schedule so I had 3 day weekends 2-3 times a month (26 times a year). I could also work for extra PTO, where if I worked extra hours one week I could save it in a \"extra time\" bank and use it as future PTO.\n\nFAANG - definetely the worse of the 3 so far. It was expected ot be available practically 24/7. I went to that FAANG company because I had heard it was one of the few that you coould have a life, but I never realized that cloud was the exception to that rule. People were respodning to emails late at night, getting on calls late, responding on vacation, etc. THey were cool about taking time off but it felt like if you weren't drinking the kool aid and doing 10x more like verybody else was doing, it wouldnt go well for you.\n\nCurrent - still early to tell but it seems that there isnt as much of a \"work late\" culture here. People set their own times, some work a bit later but Ive never seen any crazy discussions happen at 11 pm like I did in my last job. A few principal engineers have gone on vacation and not yet have I seen any of them get on a call or message thread to answer any type of question.\n\n# Expectiations:\n\nDefense - really didnt have much expectations. I practically worked 20 hours, coasted the rest, was my team's scrum master, etc and over excelled in their eyes. There was no real due date on things because contracts in defense last multiple years. I remember when I got there the expectation was to complete the project within my first year. It took 3 years to finish and nobody batted an eye.\n\nFAANG - expectations were very high. If you were finishin up with a major task, theyd throw another one at you before you were even done with the first. Seemed even as aJr/mid-level I was expected to lead meetings, always be available, etc. I worked way more at this job than I did at defense and felt like i was underperforming because if I did 8-10 hours, most others did 10-12 hour days. In reviews it seemed like I was compared to my teammates, not so much compared to what the expectation of the job was.\n\nCurrent - again still early. But seems like their expectations are pretty fair. A quote from the first day I like was \"if you want to be the person that does 40 hour weeks and gets your job done, you can have a long career here. If you want to be the person that does 50+ hour weeks here for that quicker promotion, you can do that but just respect your work-life balance\".\n\n# Time and meetings:\n\nDefense - hardly had any meetings. We did standup evertday (except fridays) for 30 minutes but it mostly lasted 15 minutes. We hardly went over. I never learned the concept of parking lot until I got to FAANG lol. It was in office so just walking to someone's desk was really just the norm.\n\nFAANG - seemed like if your day didnt have 4 hours of meetings, you were underperforming. Everything was a discussion. Parking lot would take an extra hour and most of it was discussing things that I felt didnt really have to take that long. At times some of my tasks were pushed back due to someone wanting to discuss about one simple change. If you had to talk to someone, it was hard to get them on a call and when you did they didnt appreciate their time being wasted. In meetings it seemed everyone was stressed to have the meeting finish.\n\nCurrent - seems nobody is really stressed about meetings. Parking lot items get resolved pretty quickly. Everybody doesn't mind hopping on a call and lasting an hour with you.\n\nEdit: someone asked for interview styles. I wont give exact details but ill say more or less how it was.\n\n# Interview:\n\nDefense: I was a college grad so I got invited to an all day hriing event by the company. It seemed like the interviews didnt ask anything technical, they jsut wanted to get ot know me. At the end of the day they had me list my favorite teams and told me theyd let me know. I've interviewed for other defense companies, tbh there were no leetcode questions or anything like that. Technical questions were more like \"what is OOP?\" or how I would design a simple code.\n\nFAANG - first was a pre-round codesignal style question to see if I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that I went through 2-3 rounds of interviews asking leetcode style questions and then a manager meet.\n\nBig tech - similar to faang. Pre-interview exam to make sure I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that it was 2-3 rounds of code/system questions.\n\nEdit 2: people asked about TC\n\n# TC\n\n\\- Defense: as a college grad in a HCOL state I started at about 78k wiht a 5k bonus. Within 4 years and 1 promotion I was making 90k and yearly bonuses that was around 5k-8k.  No stock. I know people who jumped to other defense company and they are around 120k. Promotion seemed like it happened every 2-3 years.\n\n\\- FAANG - I never got promoted in my few years though I doubt I deserved it in their eyes. I never really saw anybody get promoted really. Like one mid level SWE had been working more than most seniors and she didnt get promoted. AS for TC it was about 220k between base stocks and signing bonus. I moved to a low COL state shortly after joining and my base pay dropped by 20k so it ended up being around 200k\n\n\\- Current company - TC is about 200k with just basepay and stock (no signing bonus) but according to them, im promised up to 10% bonus that would bring my total pay to around 215k.\n\n# Benefits\n\n\\- Defense: 3 weeks of accrued PTO. But since there was timsheet we technically were not allowed to do overtime. A work around was if I worked 90 hours in a 2 week period, I could use 10 hours and save it in a special bank that I could use later on. So If in a 4 week period I worked 200 hours, I could set 40 hours to that special bank. And if I had a 2week vacation I could use the special bank for the first week and my regular PTO for the second week. It was good benefits outside of that, tuition reimbursement which I used to get my master's degree without taking on more debt. Discounts on personal travel (it wasnt amazing but good enough) etc.\n\n\\- FAANG - Unlimited PTO. Some of the best benefits i've ever seen will probably will ever have. There were multiple different types of reimbursement programs for almost anything. Discount codes on almost any store that were actually pretty good discounts. Similar benefits when it comes to tuition reimbursement, etc.\n\n\\- Big tech - unlimited PTO. Again good benefits, just not as good as FAANG. Company will give random 3 day weekends to employees that they announce pretty early so people have it prepared.",

        "content": "I work in a team where the majority of devs are contractors from India, except for me (I’m based in LATAM) and the lead developer who’s in the US. I’m the most recent dev to join the team.\n\nAt the beginning, I noticed people didn’t offer opinions when the lead dev spoke, and I assumed it was fear. This guy curses during dev meetings when he sees weird stuff (usually some weird requirement from product), so I thought everyone was just intimidated.\n\nBut as time went on, I realized the lead dev isn’t an ogre, he just lacks social skills. And honestly, I think there’s a lack of trust in the contractors. These guys, they do the bare minimum. Clean code practices is like an alien concept. Magic numbers in conditionals, functions scattered all over the place, no deletion of unused code, functions names not describing what they do. It’s a mess. Something that should take a day takes three, just because you have to go through the messy code or refactor first, which I think it’s only me who does it anyways.\n\nI’ve mentioned my concerns like the usage of magic numbers and only the lead dev reacts. The rest stay silent. They rarely answer questions unless I tag them in the message. It feels like they’re just taking advantage of the fact that the lead dev is a workaholic who works weekends and oversees everything. I get just doing your job and collecting paychecks, but I can’t understand this level of laziness. It’s crazy.\n\nI want to push more for clean code practices, but I don’t want to create an uncomfortable situation for anybody, specially if things seem to be working out they way things are now. The lead dev does care, but he’s got too much on his plate and is focused on shipping. He’s the only one reviewing PRs, I understand why he may let things slide. If I’m going to start reviewing PRs and putting more time into raising the quality bar, I want to make sure management sees it.\n\nOn one hand, I’d love to just keep things chill and cash my check. On the other, it’s frustrating working in this mess and seeing the laziness. Not sure how to move forward. Anyone been in a similar spot?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "If you think AI will be replacing you as an engineer, you are probably wildly overestimating the AI, or underestimating yourself. Let me explain.\n\nThe best AI cannot even do 10% of my job as a senior software engineer I estimate. And there are hard problems which prevent them from doing any better, not in the least of which is that they already ran out of training data. They are also burning through billions with no profitability in sight, almost as quickly as they are burning through natural resources such as water, electricity and chips. Not even to mention the hardest problem which is that it is a machine (or rather, routine), not a sentient being with creativity. It will always think \"inside the box\" even if that box appears to be very large. While they are at it, they hallucinate quite a good percentage of their answers as well, making them critically flawed for even the more mundane tasks without tight supervision. None of these problems have a solution in the LLM paradigm. \n\nLLMs for coding is a square peg for a round hole. People tend to think that due to AI being a program that it naturally must be good at programming, but it really doesn't work that way. It is the engineers that make the program, not the other way around. They are far better at stuff like writing and marketing, but even there it is still a tool at best and not replacing any human directly. Yes, it can replace humans indirectly through efficiency gains but only up till a point. In the long term, the added productivity gained from using the tool should merit hiring more people, so this would lead to more jobs, not less.\n\nThe reason we are seeing so many layoffs right now is simply due to the post-pandemic slump. Companies hired like crazy, had all kinds of fiscal incentives and the demand was at an all time high. Now all these factors have been reversed and the market is correcting. Also, the psychopathic tendency to value investors over people has increased warranting even more cost cutting measures disguised as AI efficiency gains. That's why it is so loved by investors, it's a carte blanche to fire people and \"trim the fat\" as they put it. For the same reason, Microsoft's CEO is spouting nonsense that XX% of the code is already written by AI. It's not true, but it raises the stock price like clockwork, and that’s the primary mission of a CEO of a large public company.\n\ntl;dr AI is mostly a grift artificially kept afloat by investor billions which are quickly running out",

I work from Monday - Friday, 9AM - 9PM (sometimes even more than that, unpaid overtime) to meet deadlines and deliver my work every week (weekly sprint). As with big tech companies, there are expectations from each hire and they have to demonstrate a set of skills and knowledge. And in order to do that, it is taking a toll in my mental and physical health. I'm not even trying to go above and beyond, I'm just trying to survive. And it's not even a company thing, I see other devs living the same life from other companies as well.\n\nI don't even have time to exercise. In the weekends, i just want to lie down, do nothing and spend time with my family.\n\nI see other developers working relentlessly, always trying to stay up to date in their spare time, learn about frameworks, be a constant \"yes\" man and put up with their managers' bs, work in the weekends.\n\nAnd here I am, just want to complete my tasks, collect paychecks, have a life. It's not like I do not want to improve, I truly do. But I don't have the energy. Sometimes i even feel like quitting my job and I know that's dumb, given the current state of job market and I'm supposed to be grateful to even have a job because many don't. I am grateful, but I am also tired. Tired to constantly stare at a screen and not finding fulfillment.\n\nSo, I have to ask, is there something wrong with me? Am I being lazy or this is truly how most feel inside deep down?",

I was very motivated to learn for a while, but I keep going through life circumstances that are killing my motivation. I honestly feel lost and don’t know where to start at the moment. I don’t know what the path is to a job. I’ve sent out a thousand applications and only got one OA through networking. I did pretty poorly. I lost my motivation to leetcode since I haven’t had one interview since I began leetcoding during my sophomore year. That part is my fault. Had I kept leetcoding, I might have landed that job. I’m not sure if I’m asking for advice or just ranting, but I genuinely don’t know what to do. My parents are aging and need to retire soon but gave up all their savings in the process of getting us to America to escape the war back home. Up until we came to the US, I was the smartest kid in school. Always at the top of my class and expected to do great things. Now I’m laying in bed while my brother screams while playing Valorant. My room is dirty, and I have no motivation to do anything. My job is mentally draining and I get screamed at daily. I can sense my parents’ disappointment every time I talk to them.

Even setting those aside, working with AI is not something I'd find particularly rewarding. It’s possible that for now, I can sneak by just volunteering for some other project, but I’m sure that will run out eventually. If all hands presentations are any indicator, my company is really drinking the \"Pivot to AI as a business model\" Kool Aid. And so I feel like I can’t turn down AI projects or even discuss my concerns without it seeming like insubordination, or putting a target on my back as not aligned with the company’s vision, or seeming like a luddite uninterested in learning new skills.\n\nI realize “AI” is a lot more than just ChatGPT-generated slop, and so I want to at least be open-minded to the ways it can be a useful tool without the ethical concerns. But I’m unsure to what extent those applications \\*do\\* exist, and if they do, how to initiate a conversation about finding projects that would be less soul-crushing. Maybe I can just keep my head down and hope this hype dies down in a year or two? Or do I need to leave this company? Or is this a problem I'm going to have at any company right now?

        "content": "I have about 3 years of experience as a software engineer. For the past 1.5 years, my old manager asked me to work with another team which is more Data science/Data engineering related. It's more backend and data science-oriented. I didn't have any prior data science experience, but the codebase was manageable, and most of my tasks involved fixing bugs or building straightforward features without  deep DS knowledge.\n\nRecently, my manager asked me if I wanted to change my job title to reflect my current role, I agreed. But to officially \"transfer\", I had to pass a Python coding test. I was surprised since by this point I'd already shipped multiple features, fixed a shit ton of bugs, but went ahead anyway.\n\nThe first test went super badly lol, questions about two-sum, basic string manipulation, pandas, and numpy threw me off. I felt terrible and asked for a retake. I studied pandas thoroughly as that was the one thing I had no experience in, but the second test didn't even have pandas questions, it had a simple fizzbuzz-type problem, some question regarding numpys again (which I got right, but I hadn't converted the original array to np.array, which got me a zero lol), For the fizz buzz type question, I messed up badly by using `if` instead of `elif`.\n\nI asked for one last try. The third test (10) questions were incredilby easy, I thought they felt pity for me lol, then came question 11 and 12, 11 had pass some argument or something to a parser, I honestly didn't even understand the question and 12 had me converting a sentence to numbers, like tokenization. I got the logic right, but couldn't remember the syntax for removing punctuation. Unfortunately, CoderPad doesn't give partial credit, so I failed again. Now I'm seriously doubting my abilities. In my mind, its like I can just look up this information ( syntax about removing punctuation) is it really fair for me to get a zero on this?\n\nEven though my manager has had no complaints and my performance reviews have been good, I'm suddenly experiencing major imposter syndrome. Missing these simple questions is making me spiral. I'm worried that without the title change, I won't get promoted, or worse, might lose my job.\n\nMaybe I'm just venting, but I'm curious if anyone else has experienced something similar. The self-doubt is really impacting my productivity and emotional state\n\nEDIT: My day to day doesn't really involve lot of coding nowadays, its mostly shipping features from existing codebase and just migrating it with some minor adjustments. Fixing bugs and talking with the stakeholders to see what kind of results are they expecting. Even when I do this, I can always test/debug, but its pretty much not possible to debug on the 'coderpad' tests. ",

I don't want to code anymore. I don't want to manage tech products. I have extensive experiencing in programming and launching products, but I am fed up with it.\n\nHas anyone else reached this point and switched careers? Any advice on something I could switch to where I wouldn't have to start over from scratch? \n\nI am reasonably intelligent, I suppose. I am a people person. I am tech-minded and feel like I would be good in a consulting-type role. I really want to avoid any programming, product manager, or program manager role, and I want to avoid more specialized tech roles like a security engineer where I'd feel even more isolated.\n\nIf anyone has personal experience or advice they'd like to share, I would greatly appreciate it.

I have been working extremely hard grinding leetcode, focusing on personal projects, and practicing interviews. I applied to at least 500 jobs and only got called for an interview from 6. Even when my interviews went well, there was always someone better in their eyes. I went to college in a different part of the country, so I don't really have access to those resources anymore. \n\nWorst part is how recruiters react when they hear I've been unemployed for 7 months: they either scoff and outright ghost. These all have been taking an extreme toll on my mental health. I've had a few resume reviews 4-5 months ago and all I got were \"it's not you but the current market or \"your profile is extremely strong, keep applying\" but it's only gone downhill from there. I had 4 internships at prestigious companies and all ended with excellent final reports but no return offers due to budget cuts. \n\nI'm sending cold messages on LinkedIn constantly but no one responds anymore. All my friends have started ghosting me as well so I can't ask for referrals from them. I can't express how depressed I've been watching all of my peers working at FAANG while I'll be happy to just take any SWE/ML job. I'm happy for them but also upset as I have no idea how to get help. \n\nThe last call I got from a recruiter, she outright asked me why I don't have a job yet in an extremely condescending manner although that requisition was for someone who graduated within the last year.\nI'm also a US citizen, so I don't think immigration/visa issues are relevant.\n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. If anyone has tips on expanding my network, getting referrals, or anything really, I'd really appreciate it.\n\nTldr; 7 months since graduation and no prospects of new grad roles. Losing all hopes and mental health is in the gutter. Would appreciate advice on building network or anything that'll get me out of this deep pit. ",

Liquid comp would be slightly lower, but there’s big upside in equity… if they succeed it would be better than the current job, if they corner the European market it could be life-changing. \n\nI'm afraid of overvaluing the equity or minimizing the stress of working at a start up in my late 30s, and I don't want to burn bridges and then burn out to later be forced to take a worse job than I have now. Also while I am personally confident they are positioned to do well and believe them when they say they have no plans on getting acquired, there's no guarantee of the equity becoming liquid or ultimately being worth much.\n\nPersonal considerations:I have a mortgage, some debt, and family plans, so stability matters. At the same time, I feel a bit stuck where I am and like the idea of working on something bold. Also the idea of getting a huge payoff is obviously attractive.\n\nAny advice or different points of view would be appreciated!",

        "author": "tempaccount00101",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Going to graduate with BS in CS soon from a no name university. I have developed a love for CS theory, specifically in anything related to reducing latency and increasing throughput. For example, distributed systems, compilers, parallel computing, high-performance computing, DSA, core OS, DB internals, CPU architecture.\n\nI'm going to be working at Meta as a SWE. Even though I'm joining at E3, I have heard many horror stories of the WLB at Meta so I already have the expectation that I will be working 50 hours per week. Hell, I have seen posts on here that might be exaggerating, but people are claiming to be working 60+ hours per week at Meta. I haven't been team matched yet since they're doing bootcamp this year for E3.\n\nWith that being said, I have done some quick back-of-the-envelope calculations and I believe if I pursue a Master's part-time, I will only have 15 hours left in my week in total for leisure (e.g. girlfriend, gym, hobbies unrelated to CS). Also, this might put a strain on my performance at work and promo speed, which is very important to me. Moreover, if I focus on work and promo speed, depending on what team I am on I am thinking since I'm in big tech where scale matters, I might already be learning about distributed systems, compilers, and the rest of my interests on the job itself without having to do a Master's. I would lose the actual credential of a Master's degree but I would probably (hopefully) have more impact, greater performance and bonus, less risk of layoff, faster promo speed, etc. at work to offset this. Furthermore, I would use 3-4 years of my early/mid 20s on further schooling, but I'm also not the type to want to party hard all night long or something like that.\n\nHowever, I also see some benefits. For one, I will only pay a total of like $2000 for the entire Master's program. Meta will cover the rest. It's GaTech's OMSCS. Additionally, when I am older, I think it might be fun to become a sessional instructor at my undergrad, which requires a grad degree. I also did some research in undergrad, and I feel like doing a Master's program might potentially open up more opportunities for research in the future. On that note, I'm also interested in the opportunity that this might open up to move into quant dev (not quant trader, researcher, analyst, or any of the \"true quant roles\"). My areas of interest are related to quant dev I believe, and I personally find finance very interesting so I think it might be a good fit. But I also don't think that GaTech OMSCS is a target program for quant firms, so regardless of whether I pursue this or not that door might just be closed.\n\nTL;DR: should I do Master's if I already have big tech full-time job lined up? Cons is mostly time commitment which might strain work performance. Pros are potential opportunities a Master's might open and I would genuinely be interested in the content, or at least I loved studying CS in undergrad.",

I'm currently working in a cloud infrastructure/devops position, mostly focused on tools like Terraform, Ansible, and CI/CD pipelines. It's solid experience, but there’s very little actual coding involved. The only other work experience I have was an internship last summer where I built automation tools in Python, but not specifically SWE. \n\nI’ve also included some personal and academic backend projects on my resume, but that doesn’t seem to be enough so far to get traction for software engineering roles.\n\nUltimately, I want to pivot into a backend engineering role, where I can focus more on building systems and writing software. I'm grateful for the opportunity I have, but I’m trying to plan out my next steps so I can move in the direction I actually want. From what I've heard, there are no pivot opportunities into dev teams internally as those teams are now offshore. \n\nCoincidentally, I am also starting an online, part-time CS masters degree in the Fall. Given how the market is, and since I've had no real work experience in backend, would it be better to apply to internships or full-time roles? ",

When discussin equity split the main guy tells me his brother is there just as advisor and he will just be getting 5% and it can not dilute. When we were negotiating my equity I told him 35% seemed fair considering it was unpaid and there were three of us. He basically said he needs equity for market, sales, etc and 10% ESOP so we decided on 14% for myself.\n\nI thought whatever, I guess he does need equity for those people so I can't get 35%. \n\nThen I get the contract and he's listed as having 71% and me 14% and I am listed as the CTO and expected to code the entire infrastructure of the application while his brother who has tech experience is just advising on best practices and stuff like that.\n\nAfter we're knees deep and I realize how much I'm working I was like wait I'm working almost a 2nd time job and this guy's getting 5x more equity than me. Then I did some research and realized this is extremely abnormal from everything I read online.\n\nSo I sent him an email saying I couldn't sign and I needed a more fair equity split mentioning 30% minimum since my 14% could get diluted to less than 5% after just a few rounds of fundraising. He set up a call and stumbled around with his words and just said he doesn't want to move forward lol. I ended up deleting all the code I wrote and data I got for them.\n\nHonestly, the main guy just felt very shady. They were both from India, and they would tell me weird ways to get people to negotiate really low like how they did in India. And I felt like they did that with me and just wanted a free app basically.\n\nI feel like the fact that he wasn't even willing to negotiate at all is a huge sign that we would have just had way too many problems down the line. The 71/14 split really made me feel like an employee and not a cofounder and it didn't motivate me to want to push really hard.\n\n  \nWhat do you guys think?",
