        "content": "Received an alert this morning stating that compute usage increased 2000% on a data warehouse.\n\nI went and looked at the top queries coming in and spotted evidence of Vibe coders right away. Stuff like SELECT \\* or SELECT TOP 7,000,000 \\* with a list of 50 different tables and thousands of fields at once (like 10,000), all joined on non-clustered indexes.  And not just one query like this, but tons coming through.\n\nStarted to look at query plans and calculate algorithmic complexity. Some of this was resulting in 100 Billion Query Steps and killing the Data Warehouse, while also locking all sorts of tables and causing resource locks of every imaginable style.  The data warehouse, until the rise of citizen developers, was so overprovisioned that it rarely exceeded 5% of its total compute capability; however, it is now spiking at 100%.\n\nThat being said, management is overjoyed to boast about how they are adding more and more 'vibe coders' (who have no background in development and can't code, i.e., they are unfamiliar with concepts such as inner joins versus outer joins or even basic SQL syntax). They know how to click, cut, paste, and run. Paste the entire schema dump and run the query.  This is the same management by the way that signed a deal with a cloud provider and agreed to pay $2million dollars for 2TB of cold log storage lol \n\nThe rise of Citizen Developers is causing issues where I am, with potentially high future costs.

        "content": "Recently I decided to start out as a Freelancer, a big part of my problem was that I need to show some projects in my portfolio and github, but most of my work was in corporates and I cant share any of the information or show code from my experience. So, I decided to make some projects for my portfolio, to show demos of what I offer as a freelancer for companies and startups.\n\nAs an experiment, I decided to try out vibe coding, setting up a fully automated daily batch etl from api requests to aws lambda functions, athena db and daily jobs with flows and crawlers.\n\nTakes from my first project:\n\n1. Vibe coding is a trap, if I didn't have 5 years of experience, I wouldv'e made the worst project I could imagine, with bad and old practices, unreadable code, no edgecase handling and just a lot of bad stuff\n2. It can help with direction, and setting up very simple tasks one by one, but you shouldn't give the AI large tasks at once.\n3. Always try to provide your prompts a taste of the data, the structure is never enough.\n4. If you spend more than 20 minutes trying to solve a problem with AI, it probably won't solve it. (at least not in a clean and logical way)\n5. The code it creates between files and tasks is very inconsistent, looks like a different developer made it everytime, make sure to provide it with older code it made so it knows to keep the consistency.\n\nExample of my worst experience:\n\nI tried creating a crawler for my partitioned data reading CSV files from S3 into an athena table. my main problem was that my dates didnt show up correctly, the problem the AI thought was very focused on trying to change data formats until it hits something that athena supports. the real problem was actually in another column that contained commas in the strings, but because I gave the AI the data and it looked at the dates as the problem, no matter what it tried, it never tried to look outside the box. I tried for around 2.5-3 hours fixing this problem, and ended up fixing it in 15 minutes by using my eyes instead of the AI.\n\n  \nLink to the final project repo: [https://github.com/roey132/aws\\_batch\\_data\\_demo](https://github.com/roey132/aws_batch_data_demo)\n\n\\*Note\\* - The project could be better, and there are many places to fix and use much better practices, i might review them in the future, but for now, im moving onto the next project (taking the data from aws to a streamlit dashboard.)\n\nHope it helps anyone! good luck with your projects and learning, and remember, AI is good, but its still not a replacement for your experience.",

When I was working as an Analyst, I mostly enjoyed preparing, transforming, managing the data rather than displaying it with graphs and all. Which is why I'm now targeting more Data Engineer positions. Thing is, when I'm reading job descriptions, I feel discouraged by what's asked as skills.\n\nWhat I know/have/done:\n\n* Certified SnowProCore\n* Certified Alteryx Advanced\n* Experienced Tableau Analyst \n* Used extensively PostgreSQL \n* I know Python, having used it back in the days (and some time to time) but I lost some of it. Mostly used pandas to prepare datasets. I'll need a refresher on this though.\n* Built a whole backend for a Flutter-based app (also the frontend) using Supabase: designed the schemas, the tables, RLS, Edge Functions, cron jobs (related to the startup I mentionned earlier)\n* Experience with Git\n* Have a really low understanding of container with Docker\n* Currently reading the holy bible that is The fundamentals of Data Engineering\n\n\nWhat I don't have:\n\n* Experience on AWS/Azure/GCP\n* Spark/Hadoop\n* Kafka\n* Airflow\n* DBT/Databricks\n* Didn't do a lot of data pipelines\n* Didn't do a lot of CI/CD\n\nand probably more I'm forgetting. I'm a quick learner and love to experiment, but as I want to make sure to be as prepared as possible for job interviews, I'd like to focus on the most important skill that I currently lack. What would you recommend?\n\nThank you for your help!",

Clearly AI generated.\n\nThey all belong to bots, AI posters, marketing and salesmen people, market research, etc. It's a clear example of dead internet. \n\nI know moderating a sub is hard, but you don't even have to spend 5 minutes to come across these kind of posts. \n\nProposals that usually work can be draconian, but for example, permanent bans on spam, 0 effort posts, self promotion and marketing, etc, should be implemented IMO. They were never going to contribute anything to the subreddit anyways, and marketers, article spammers, etc, shouldn't be able to post on communities with thousands of members for free.

        "content": "Im a DE with several years of experience in analytics, but after a year into my role, I’m starting to feel like a failure. I wanted to become a DE because somewhere along the lines of me being an analyst, I decided I like SWE more than data analysis/science and felt DE was a happy medium.\n\nBut 1 year in, I’m not sure what I signed up for. I constantly feel like a failure at my job. Every single day I feel utterly confused because the business side of things is not clear to me - I’m given tasks, not sure what the big picture is, not sure what it is I’m supposed to accomplish. I just “do” without really knowing the upstream side of things. Then I’m told to go through source data and just feel expected to “know” how everything tied together without receiving guidance or training on the data. I ask questions and I’ve been more proactive after receiving some negative feedback lately about my ability to turn things around-frequently assigned tasks that are assumed to be “4 hours of effort” that realistically take at least few days. Multiply one task by 4-5 tasks and this is expected to be completed in a span of less than 2 weeks. \n\nI ask, communicate, document, etc. But at the end of it all, I still feel my questions aren’t being answered and my lack of knowledge due to lack of exposure or clear instructions makes me seem frequently dumb (ie: manager will be like “why would you not do this” when it was never previously explained to me and where there was no way I’d know without somebody telling me). I’ve made mistakes that felt sh*tty too because I’m so pressured to get something done on time that it ends up being sloppy. I am not really using my technical skills at all-at my old job, being one of the few people who wrote code relatively well, I developed interactive tools or built programs/libraries that really streamlined the work and helped scale things and I was frequently recognized for that work. When I go on the data science sub, I’m made to feel that my emphasis on technical skills is a waste of time because it’s the “business” and not “technical skills” that’s worth $$$. I don’t see how the 2 are mutually exclusive? I find my team has a technical debt problem and the deeper we get there, the more I don’t think this helps scale business. A lot of our “business solutions” can be scaled up for several clients but because we don’t write code and do processes in a way where we can re-use it for different use cases, we’re left with spending way too much time doing stuff tediously and manually that prolongs delays that usually then ends up feeling like a blame game that comes right back at me. \n\nI’ve been trying, really trying to reflect and be honest with myself. I’ve tried to communicate with my boss that I’m struggling with the workload. But I feel like there’s a feeling at the end that it’s me. \n\nI don’t feel great. I wish I was in a SWE role but I don’t even think that’s realistically possible for me given my lack of experience and the job market. Also not sure SWE is the move. My role seems to be evolving into a project management/product manager role and while I don’t mind gaining those skills, I also don’t know what I’m doing anymore. I don’t think this job seems like a good fit for me but I don’t know what other jobs I can do. I’ve thought about the AI/ML engineering team on my job but I don’t have enough experience at all for it. I feel too technically unskilled for other engineer jobs but not “business savvy” enough to do a non-technical project/product based role. If anybody has insight, I’d appreciate it. ",

From ingestion to visualization. You can specify something if its realated to your business case.\n\nForgot to post mine, but it would be:\n\nIngestion and Orchestration: Aiflow\n\nStorage/Database: Databricks or BigQuery\n\nTransformation: dbt cloud\n\nVisualization: I would build it from the ground up use front end devs and some libs like D3.js.

What started as a straightforward streaming pipeline turned into: procedures dynamically generating SQL merge statements, tasks chained together with dependencies, custom parallel processing logic because the sequential stuff was too slow...\n\nSo we decided to give Dynamic Tables a try.\n\n**What changed:** Instead of maintaining all those procedures and task dependencies, we now have simple table definitions that handle deduplication, incremental processing, and scheduling automatically. One definition replaced what used to be multiple procedures and merge statements.\n\n**The reality check:** It's not perfect. We lost detailed logging capabilities (which were actually pretty useful for debugging), there are SQL transformation limitations, and sometimes you miss having that granular control over exactly what's happening when.\n\nFor our use case, I think it’s a better option than the pipeline, which grew and grew with additional cases that appeared along the way.\n\n**Anyone else made similar trade-offs?** Did you simplify and lose some functionality, or did you double down and try to make the complex stuff work better?\n\nAlso curious - anyone else using Dynamic Tables vs traditional Snowflake pipelines?

This is quite exciting, but also I'm not so experienced to be confident about my choices here, so would really use your advice :).\n\nI need to build a system that will run multiple pipelines that will be ingesting data from various sources (MS SQL databases, API, Splunk etc.) to one MS SQL database. I'm thinking about going with the setup suggested in the title - using DLTHub for ingestion pipelines, DBT or SQLMesh for transforming data in the database and Airflow to schedule this. Is this generally speaking a good direction?\n\nFor some more context:  \n\\- for now the volume of the data is quite low and the frequency of the ingestion is daily at most;  \n\\- I need a strong focus on security and privacy due to the nature of the data;  \n\\- I'm sitting on Azure.\n\nAnd lastly a specific technical question, as I started to implement this solution locally - does anyone have experience with running dlt on Airflow? What's the optimal way to structure the credentials for connections there? For now I specified them in Airflow connections, but then in each Airflow task I need to pull the credentials from the connections and pass them to dlt source and destination, which doesn't make much sense. What's the better option?\n\nThanks!",

The sad part of it was that DE role had absolutely no work in the start-up idk why they even hired me but i salvaged what i could, I built basic stacks from scratch(combo of managed and serverless services), set up CDC, Data Lake-ish architecture(not how clean as i had hoped it to be) all while the data being extremely minimal like MBs, I solely did it just to learn because the CEO did not seem to care about anything at all. I'm pretty sure the lay-off was because they realised if they don't have the product or the data or the money to pay me so why need a DE at all (honestly why keep the company at all). I might have fumbled a lil and i should have switched sooner but the problem still stands that I have no prod or any real DE experience. I experiement with services all the time, anything opensource(basics using docker) like kafka, airflow and I have a strong handle of AWS I would like to believe. Now that I am here -- unemployed, idk what to do, I must clarify that i do tech for money and my passions do lie elsewhere. But I don't hate it or anything and I really like the money. I just don't know how to get back into the DE market, like yk where there a lil bit of senior DE team that wouldn't mind hiring me just because (I am willing to learnn). I actually gave freelance DE a thought too. Like I have AWS certifications and stuff, how about breaking into freelance consulting? anyways, I would love to know what you would do in a situation like this.\n\nPS: Please be kind for my mental health purposes thanks.\n\n",

It works great but one scenario is bothering me.\n\nEach day we get a CSV of all *active* customers from our vendor delivered to our S3 landing zone. That is, each file contains every customer as long as they’ve made a purchase in the last 3 years. So from day to day there’s a LOT of repetition. The vendor says they cannot deliver the data incrementally.\n\nThe business wants to be able to report on customer activity going back 10 years. Right now I’m keeping each daily CSV going back 10 years just in case reprocessing is ever needed (we can’t go back to our vendor for expired customer records). But storing all those duplicate records feels so wasteful. Adjusting the drop-off to be less frequent won’t work because the business wants the data up-to-date.\n\nHas anyone encountered a similar scenario and found an approach they liked? Or do I just say “storage is cheap” and move on? Each file is a few gb in size.\n",

        "author": "sanjayio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello Data Engineers 👋\n\nI've been scouting on the internet for the best and easiest way to setup **dbt Core 1.9.0 with Airflow 3.0** orchestration. I've followed through many tutorials, and most of them don't work out of the box, require fixes or version downgrades, and are broken with recent updates to Airflow and dbt.\n\nI'm here on a mission to find and document the best and easiest way for Data Engineers to run their dbt Core jobs using Airflow, that will simply **work out of the box**. \n\n**Disclaimer**: This tutorial is designed with a Postgres backend to work out of the box. But you can change the backend to any supported backend of your choice with little effort.\n\nSo let's get started. \n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Docker desktop (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)\n- Python 3.12 or higher (https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n- Code repo (https://dbtengineer.com/airflow-with-dbt-core-tutorial/#code-repo-video-tutorial)\n\n## Video Tutorial\n\n{% embed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUfYuMjHQCc&ab_channel=DbtEngineer %}\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Clone the repo in prerequisites. \n2. Create a data folder in the root folder on your local.\n3. Rename `.env-example` to `.env` and create new values for all missing values. Instructions to create the fernet key at the end of this Readme.\n4. Rename `airflow_settings-example.yaml` to `airflow_settings.yaml` and use the values you created in `.env` to fill missing values in `airflow_settings.yaml`.\n5. Rename `servers-example.json` to `servers.json` and update the host and username values to the values you set above.\n\n## Running Airflow Locally\n\n1. Run `docker compose up` and wait for containers to spin up. This could take a while.\n2. Access pgAdmin web interface at [localhost:16543](http://localhost:16543). Create a public database under the postgres server.\n3. Access Airflow web interface at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Trigger the dag.\n\n## Running dbt Core Locally\n\nCreate a virtual env for installing dbt core\n\n```sh\npython3 -m venv dbt_venv\nsource dbt_venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nOptional, to create an alias\n\n```sh\nalias env_dbt='source dbt_venv/bin/activate'\n```\n\nInstall dbt Core\n\n```sh\npython -m pip install dbt-core dbt-postgres\n```\n\nVerify Installation\n\n```sh\ndbt --version\n```\n\nCreate a `profile.yml` file in your `/Users/<yourusernamehere>/.dbt` directory and add the following content. \n\n```yaml\ndefault:\n  target: dev\n  outputs:\n    dev:\n      type: postgres\n      host: localhost\n      port: 5432\n      user: your-postgres-username-here\n      password: your-postgres-password-here\n      dbname: public\n      schema: public\n```\n\nYou can now run dbt commands from the dbt directory inside the repo.\n\n```sh\ncd dbt/hello_world\ndbt compile\n```\n\n## Cleanup\n\nRun `Ctrl + C` or `Cmd + C` to stop containers, and then `docker compose down`.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Generating fernet key\n\n```sh\npython3 -c \"from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())\"\n```\n\nI hope this tutorial was useful. Let me know your thoughts and questions in the comments section. \n\nHappy Coding!",

        "content": "So the company I'm working with doesn't have anything like a Databricks or Snowflake. Everything is on-prem and the tools we're provided are Python, MS SQL Server, Power BI and the ability to ask IT to set up a shared drive.\n\nThe data flow I'm dealing with is a small-ish amount of data that's made up of reports from various outside organizations that have to be cleaned/transformed and then reformed into an overall report.\n\nI'm looking at something like a Medallion-like architecture where I have bronze (raw data), silver (cleaning/transforming) and gold (data warehouse connected to powerbi) layers that are set up as different schemas in SQL Server. Also, should the bronze layer just be a shared drive in this case or do we see a benefit in adding it to the RDBMS?  \n  \nSo I'm basically just asking for a gut check here to see if this makes sense or if something like Delta Lake would be necessary here. In addition, I've traditionally used schemas to separate dev from uat and prod in the RDBMS. But if I'm then also separating it by  medallion layers then we start to get what seems to be some unnecessary schema bloat. \n\nAnyway, thoughts on this? ",

        "content": "So I am in my first DE job, been here for a year, working for a company who hasn't had someone whose title was DE before. There were lots of people doing small scale data engineering type tasks using a variety of no-code tools, but no one was writing custom pipelines or working with a data warehouse. I basically set up our snowflake database, ETL pipelines, and a few high impact dashboards. The situation was such that even as a relative beginner there was low-hanging fruit where I could make a big impact.\n\nWhen I was getting hired, it seemed like they were taking a chance on me as an individual but also 'data engineering' as a concept, they didn't really know if they 'needed it'. I think partly because of this, and partly because I was just out of school, my compensation is pretty low for a DE at 72k (living in a US city but not a major coastal city).\n\nBut, there are good benefits, I haven't needed to work more than 40 hours more than two or three times, and I feel like the work is interesting. I'm also able to learn on the job because I'm pretty much defining/inventing the tech stack as I go. There is a source of tension though where it feels like no one really understands when I do something innovative or creative to solve a problem, and because of that sometimes it feels like timelines/expectations are expressed with no knowledge of what goes into my work which can be a little frustrating. But, to be fair nothing ever really happens when a timeline is missed.\n\nMy hunch is that if I asked for a raise it would be denied since they seem to be under the impression anyone with a basic data engineering related education could take my place. IMO, if someone tried to take my place there would be a months-long learning process about the business and all the data relationships before they could support existing work let alone produce more.\n\nAnyway, just curious if this seems like I'm hoping for too much? I'm happy overall, but don't know if I am just being naive and should be getting more in terms of recognition, money, opportunities to advance. What are other people's work experiences like? I have a feeling people make more than me by a lot but I don't know if that comes with more stress too.\n\n  \nTLDR: I'm getting paid 72k with, working 40 hours a week, good benefits, not a ton of stress, 1 year of full time DE experience, should I be looking for more?",

I'm familiar with the theory of the data warehouse toolkit but I haven't had that much experience implementing it. For reference, we are doing this in snowflake/dbt and were talking about tables with a few million rows.\n\nI am trying to model a process which has a fixed hierarchy. We have 3 layers to this - a top level organisational plan, a plan for doing a functional test and then the individual steps taken to complete this plan. To make it a bit more complicated - whilst the process I am looking at has a fixed hierarchy but the process is a subset of a larger process which allows for arbitrary depth, I feel that the simpler business case is easier to solve first.\n\nI want to end up with 1 or several dimensional models to capture this, store descriptive text etc. The literature states that fixed hierarchies should be flattened. If we took this approach:\n\n* Our dimension table grain is 1 row for each task\n* Each row would contain full textual information for the functional test and the organisational plan\n* We have a small 'One Big Table' approach, making it easy for BI users to access the data\n\nThe challenge I see here is around what keys to use. Our business processes map to different levels of this hierarchy, some to the top level plan, some to the functional test and some to the step.\n\nI keep going back and forth as a more normalised approach - where 1 table for each of these steps and then build a bridge table to map them all together is something that we have done for arbitrary depth and it worked really well.\n\nIf we are to go with a flattened model then:\n\n* Should I include the surrogate keys for each level in the hierarchy (preferred) or model the relationship in a secondary table?\n* Business analysts are going to use this - is this their preferred approach - they will have fewer joins to do but will need to do more aggregation/deduplication if they are only interested in top level information\n\nIf we go for a more normalised model:\n\n* Should we be offering a pre-joined view of the data - effectively making a 'one big table' available at the cost of performance?",

        "author": "Roody_kanwar",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently joined a new company and started this week. My first assigned task is optimizing an existing pipeline that the team has been using. However, the pipeline requires significant work.\n\nThis team hasn’t had a dedicated data professional before, so they outsourced pipeline development to an offshore team. Upon reviewing the pipeline, I was shocked. There’s zero documentation, no helpful comments or method signatures, and even variable declarations are riddled with errors (e.g., indexes spelled as indekes). The function and class naming conventions are also poor. While I haven’t done extensive data engineering work before, I’m certain these are subpar coding practices. It seems the offshore team got away with this because no one technical was overseeing the work. The pipeline has broken frequently in the past, and instead of proper fixes, it’s been patched with band-aid solutions when what it really needs is a complete overhaul.\n\n# The Core Problem:\n\nThe team wants a unified database where each customer has a unique primary key. However:\n\n* Data comes from 5-6 sources, none of which have primary keys for joining.\n* PII (and other details) for the same customer can differ across sources.\n* The goal is to deduplicate and unify all customer records under a single ID.\n\nI’m considering fuzzy matching, but with \\~1M rows, pairwise comparisons are computationally expensive. The offshore team attempted a workaround:\n\n1. **Blocking:** Grouping potentially similar records (name variants, emails and phone numbers) to reduce comparison scope.\n2. **Similarity Scoring:** Running comparisons only within these blocks.\n\nI had some questions\n\n1. Is there a better approach? Have you worked on similar problems? Any recommended tools/strategies?\n2. Learning resources? I’m relatively new to data engineering and want to do this right. Any books, papers, or guides on large-scale deduplication?\n\nThis is a critical project, and I’d appreciate any advice whether technical, procedural, or even just moral support! Thanks in advance, and feel free to ask follow-up questions.",

To get rolling fast, I just replicated our production database to another database on different server and use it for all BI purposes. Unfortunately, because it’s all highly normalized transactional data, we use views with many joins to load fact and dimension tables into PowerBi. \n\nWe have decided to use Synpase Analytics for data warehousing in order to persist fact and dimension tables and load them faster into PowerBi. \n\nI understand Microsoft is moving resources to Fabric, which is still half-baked. Unfortunately, tools like Snowflake or Databricks are not options for our agency, as we are fully committed to a Microsoft stack. \n\nHas anyone else faced this scenario? Are there any resources you might recommend for maintaining fact and dimension tables in a dedicated Synapse pool and updating them based on changes to an OLTP database? \n\nThanks much! ",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Fun fact - Yes, most databases use B+ trees to hold data, but these trees are not actually very deep; most of them are hardly 3 to 4 levels deep.\n\nA page size is either 4 KB or 8 KB, and a typical B+ tree has a branching factor of 300-500 for a page size of 8 KB. This implies that for a 4-level B+ tree, the total number of leaf nodes will be\n\nLevel 1 - 1  \nLevel 2 - 400  \nLevel 3 - 400 \\* 400  \nLevel 4 - 400 \\* 400 \\* 400 = 64M leaf nodes\n\nEach of the 64M leaf node points to a page of size 8KB holding the actual row. Now, assuming each row is 100B long, each leaf node can hold 80 database rows.\n\nWith this as our core assumption, the total number of rows this B+ tree can hold is 64M \\* 80 = 5.12 billion rows. Pretty neat :)\n\nWe can thus fairly assume that a typical database would not take more than 3 or 4 page reads to locate any record and then a couple more lookups to read the data stored in the heap.\n\nI also uncovered:  \n  \n\\- Why Redis still uses hash tables (and when it makes sense)  \n\\- How major databases like Oracle secretly use BOTH structures (and why)  \n\\- How B+ trees and Hash tables works internally  \n  \nRead the full breakdown in my latest newsletter article.\n\nDo you think we will have more advanced indexing than B+ trees in the future?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks – my friend and I have been thinking a lot about the communication overhead between business stakeholders and data engineers when it comes to building data pipelines. From what we observe at our job and further validated by chatting with a couple friends in data engineering space, a lot of time is spent just getting alignment – business users describing what they want, engineers trying to translate that into something technically feasible, and a lot of back-and-forth when things aren’t clear.\n\nWe’re exploring whether it’s possible to reduce this overhead with a self-service tool powered by an “AI data engineer” agent. The idea is:\n\n* Business users specify what they want (e.g., “I need a dashboard showing X broken down by Y every week”).\n* The AI agent builds the pipeline using the existing data stack.\n* If there's any ambiguity or missing context, it prompts the user for feedback. If they don’t know the answer, they can loop in a technical person, all in the same tool. Technical/data team can provide necessary context so the agent can carry forward.\n* After getting clarification, the agent continues building the pipeline.\n* Once the pipeline is built, technical/data team verify, review, edit or approve \n\nThis way, non-technical users could handle more of the work themselves, and engineers can focus on higher-leverage tasks instead of ad-hoc asks.\n\nWe’re super early ideation and trying to understand if this is actually a real pain point for others – or if it’s already solved well enough with existing tools, or is it just another \"imagined problem\".\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts:\n\n* Do you run into this communication gap in your org?\n* Would something like this be useful, or would it just add noise?\n* Are there any tools out there that already handle this well?\n\nAny perspectives would be appreciated!",

        "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nAI is all about extracting value from data, and its biggest hurdles today are reliability and scale, no other engineering discipline comes close to Data Engineering on those fronts.\n\nThat's why I'm excited to share with you an open source project I've been working on for a while now and we finally made the repo public. I'd love to get your feedback on it as I feel this community is the best to comment on some of the problems we are trying to solve.\n\n[fenic](https://github.com/typedef-ai/fenic) is an opinionated, PySpark-inspired DataFrame framework for building AI and agentic applications.\n\nTransform unstructured and structured data into insights using familiar DataFrame operations enhanced with semantic intelligence. With first-class support for markdown, transcripts, and semantic operators, plus efficient batch inference across any model provider.\n\nSome of the problems we want to solve:\n\nBuilding with LLMs reminds a lot of the map-reduce era. The potential is there but the APIs and systems we have are too painful to use and manage in production.\n\n1. UDFs calling external APIs with manual retry logic\n2. No cost visibility into LLM usage\n3. Zero lineage through AI transformations\n4. Scaling nightmares with API rate limits\n\nHere's an example of how things are done with fenic:\n\n    # Instead of custom UDFs and API orchestration\n    relevant_products = customers_df.semantic.join(\n        products_df,\n        join_instruction=\"Given customer preferences: {interests:left} and product: {description:right}, would this customer be interested?\"\n    )\n    \n    # Built-in cost tracking\n    result = df.collect()\n    print(f\"LLM cost: ${result.metrics.total_lm_metrics.cost}\")\n    \n    # Row-level lineage through AI operations\n    lineage = df.lineage()\n    source = lineage.backward([\"failed_prediction_uuid\"])\n\n# Our thesis:\n\nData engineers are uniquely positioned to solve AI's reliability and scale challenges. But we need AI-native tools that handle semantic operations with the same rigor we bring to traditional data processing.\n\n# Design principles:\n\n* PySpark-inspired API (leverage existing knowledge)\n* Production features from day one (metrics, lineage, optimization)\n* Multi-provider support with automatic failover\n* Cost optimization and token management built-in\n\n# What I'm curious about:\n\n* Are other teams facing similar AI integration challenges?\n* How are you currently handling LLM inference in pipelines?\n* Does this direction resonate with your experience?\n* What would make AI integration actually seamless for data engineers?\n\nThis is our attempt to evolve the data stack for AI workloads. Would love feedback from the community on whether we're heading in the right direction.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/typedef-ai/fenic](https://github.com/typedef-ai/fenic). Please check it, break it, open issues, ask anything and if it resonates please give it a star!\n\nFull disclosure: I'm one of the creators and co-founder at typedef.ai.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I am considering database CI/CD frameworks for a long term project to handle database evolution eloquently. At my place of work, it's pretty common to just spin up at a database and have an admin make ad-hoc changes to create/modify users, permissions, schemas, tables, etc. (if you're lucky, they commit those changes to a repo). This generally doesn't pose any issues when we expect the life-cycle of the project to be a matter of months-- and it helps us move quick when we have a crunched deadline and a smallish team, reduces overhead/red tape, but scrappy. For reference, these are generally analytic databases, not hooked up to any downstream application, save for a dashboard here or there. Our products are generally processed data itself or research derived from that data. \n\nThe downsides to this scrappy database approach is the one prod environment can become messy, the admin might not always remember to commit ddl changes to version control, and if a dev is creating stored procs or something, that is likely going to fly under the radar of source/version control. Ultimately it can become hard to maintain and hard to appropriately gatekeep and record what changes are made when. \n\nSo I come with a question for those of you that use flyway, liquibase, atlas, dbmate or any similar tools: How has it made your life easier/harder? How do you get buy-in from your teams? Feel free to note anything else about using these tools that feels relevant. ",

DBT operators (or Docker operators ) would run the command `dbt run` for whole projects.\n\nWhat happens usually is dbt runs sometimes fail due to some sql bug or data issue not detected by QA. And then people would be force to fix the models, deploy a new version of the models, and rerun the airflow tasks, which in return would force airflow to rerun the whole dbt projects, instead of the models that had failed. \n\nIs there any way anyone knows of avoiding this? I know wich cosmos you could split a dbt project into individual tasks per model, but im afraid that will create too many tasks on the airflow scheduler. Ideally there would be a way to clear an airflow task that runs a dbt operator, and that dbt operator would know from which failing model to continue. \n\nAnyway, sorry about the long post, was hoping to get some fresh ideas from the sub :)",

That’s when the learning started.\n\nNow, after 6+ years working professionally as a software engineer, I’ve realized most beginners don’t need more tutorials, they need *direction and feedback*.\n\nIf you’re stuck in tutorial hell or unsure what to focus on, feel free to ask. I’m happy to share what helped me move forward or answer questions you have about breaking out of that phase.\n\n**What helped you escape tutorial hell, or what are you struggling with right now?**",

        "title": "For new coders: If you want to organically learn a lot about Javascript and coding in general, consider playing Bitburner.",
        "author": "cheyyne",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "If you haven't heard of it, Bitburner is a free coding game in which you take on the role of a hacker writing Javascript to hack computers in a cyberpunk world, earn money, and eventually do lots of things that I can't go into here.\n\nThe actual 'hacking' is very simplified, the game doesn't teach you cyber security - it's more about writing code that gets things done. In the beginning of the game, you are shown examples for how to write basic things, which you can then learn to improve upon.\n\nThe game naturally evolves to become a bit more complex as you play, and you are rewarded for thinking about how to make things happen more efficiently, which results in a rewarding gameplay loop that fosters learning without holding your hand, so you have creative freedom.\n\nAnd that's sort of the thing of it; you can muddle through using code that's 'good enough' *if you want to.* But you will more likely be inspired to find that next way to level up your code, to make it more effective, to find the inefficiency and ruthlessly eliminate it.\n\nA large part of what makes the game useful is that you are writing real code in a real language using real javascript syntax, with scripts that are really running on your computer; there is very good documentation that you can read to figure out how to improve your code yourself, and how to understand the in-game systems; and the in-game help for how you might approach newly unlocked mechanics is quite good, though not universally so (looking at you, corporate \"Smart Supply\" script example!). And if you get stuck, there is a Discord full of very helpful people who can assist you with whatever you don't understand.\n\nAnyhow, though I've done a lot in other languages, before last year I hadn't learned almost any Javascript. Now I've got almost a thousand hours in Bitburner, I've learned how to think about a lot of elementary coding problems in new ways, I've learned a lot of Javascript, and I've even come face to face with a number of Javascript's hated quirks - all from just trying to *make more damn money than I did on my last run, given my current system's limitations.*\n\nSo I heartily recommend giving it a shot. You can find Bitburner on Steam, or at [https://bitburner-official.github.io/](https://bitburner-official.github.io/). You can find the documentation for all the game's commands [here, at https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md). (It says NS, which just means the object which, for all intents and purposes, contains the commands and functions that you can do in the game that aren't straight javascript declarations). Expect a certain amount of exploration - once you're knee deep, you'll be checking through documentation for a given mechanic and get valuable 'Aha!' moments.\n\n**NOTE: If you are playing to learn coding, I strongly recommend -avoiding- looking up other player's solutions.** It's okay to start off with an example, but you'll only grow as a programmer by figuring out novel ways to overcome the challenges you'll face. The solution you find for yourself, even if it's less efficient, is infinitely more valuable - and you will find more and more solutions as you get better at thinking like a coder. If you really do hit a hard wall, you might ask AI how a problem could be approached - you'll find GPT has a good corpus of Bitburner dialect in its training data - but do your best to solve your problems with whatever you find in the help files and in the game's documentation. And if you do give in, you could ask on the Bitburner discord, where players will be happy to hint at the right approach without out and out solving the puzzle for you.\n\nAnyway, I hope some novice coders find this valuable and discover how fun coding can be through this game. (I have no affiliation with the game or its devs. Just a big fan.) Have fun! Happy coding!",

Most notably concurrent programming. \n\nI also see so many posts by users in this community that they are struggling to grasp concepts or move past beginner. Not saying it will for sure work for everyone but like it definitely worked for me? \n\nYet if I was to speak on that experience Id be called culty and just experience pure hate for FP with no explanation. I really have never experienced this cultiness people talk about. Wouldn't this hate signal that OOP is kinda culty? Like to me a cult is like a religion in that you're not supposed to question it but I've never met a Haskell dev like that, in fact they will probably happily and curiously chat about my question with me for hours. On the OOP side I've never really heard any convincing explanation as to why we do things a certain way, there's just the \"pythonic\" way to do stuff for example. But then if I point out an issue with their logic it always becomes \"how come you dont know OOP\" or some crazy question which is weird because OOP is quite simple and it often times has nothing to do with OOP theory. Before I get attacked inevitably with questions of the same category as that, I do have experience with OOP and my past project was acquired by Xerox to help plan their sales efforts. \n\nIve also never heard any reason why Haskell is a bad choice besides it can be hard to learn, which I do agree with to an extent, but that's a very fixable problem as its often taught by researchers who are obsessed with the most advanced aspects of the language, and there are many great resources like learn you a Haskell that make it easy as all heck to learn.

Some dummies need to study English rather than digital electronics.\n\n\nI just want to share my humble opinion from what I saw and experienced. This post may not be suitable for complete beginners. I assume that you already know DS&A and can build something at least in two different languages.\n\nI see so many questions, not only in this subreddit but generally on the web, like \"which language should I choose/is good to start/should I learn,\" etc. I think this is kind of missing the idea of \"software engineering\" or development.\n\nI bet most of us were stuck in \"language hell\" before. What should I learn? C? C++? Java? Fortran? Cobol? PL/I? Python? Rust? You can extend this list.\n\nLanguage is usually the easiest part of programming. Because in 2025, you can just open Google and type \"xyz language syntax/libraries,\" and then you get a kabillion resources about it.\n\nIf language were that important, I bet most of the computer science classes would focus on low or mid-level languages like Assembly or C and similar languages.\n\nSo you (we) should focus on technology rather than the syntax. You should focus on \"how can I store/manipulate/transmit this digital data more efficiently?\"\n\nWhen you list your languages in your CV like this:\n\n* C & C++\n* Java\n* Python\n* Haskell\n* Verilog\n* so on\n\nyes, it shows something but not everything or big picture. It is still too abstract and does not answer \"Are you capable of using the [ARINC 429](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_429) standard to transfer encrypted data?\" or \"Which boards did you work on?\" or \"Have you deployed a containerized microservice on Kubernetes with Helm charts?\" or \"Can you deploy a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins?\"\n\nThe other issue that occurs due to focusing on languages too much is that you do not know how you should create your portfolio. Since you focused on the language, you are hanging around basic implementations like a calculator, simple USB driver, or an asynchronous web page, etc.\n\nThe more experienced programmers would notice that I am pointing out the \"specialization.\"  \nLet's be honest, in 2025, industries do not need too many juniors.\n\nSo rather than obsessing about languages, explore the telecommunication standards, protocols, and preferred [software architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_architecture_styles_and_patterns) and technologies you’ll actually use in your target industry, then build projects around those. This approach will teach you the necessary language and engineering skills at the same time.",

I have tried doing the school thing and with my current work life plus just life in general I always just fall behind. My question to you guys is self taught really a viable option anymore. Like if I taught my self a language and built a whole portfolio  would I get the same or close to the same opportunity that someone from a university does? If so what all should I learn knowing AI is in the picture now I know it can be easier than ever to code. What yall think should I shoot my shot?",

Like, what made the switch from “I’m just reading stuff” to “I actually understand what I’m doing”?\n\nMost advice out there is the same laundry list: spaced repetition, Pomodoro, flashcards, blah blah. But I’m way more curious about how people landed on what works for them. Did you start by failing a lot and then tweaking your method? Copy a YouTuber’s setup and slowly ditch most of it? Realize that everything falls apart after 3 p.m. so you built your schedule around that?\n\nI think a lot of us, especially in programming, go through that phase where we’re doing tutorials on autopilot, feeling like we’re learning, but nothing sticks. Then something clicks. Maybe it's building your own project, maybe it's just doing spaced recall the right way, or realizing that you need to write code, not just watch it being written.\n\nPersonally, I used to grind tutorial after tutorial thinking I was improving, but I couldn’t build anything from scratch. Only after I started using flashcards and forcing myself to explain stuff in my own words did things actually start sticking.\n\nAnyway, I’d love to hear what your turning point was. Like, when did learning stop being random chaos and start becoming a process you understood?\n",

I am mostly a JavaScript developer with mostly working with react. Some of the stuff I know for full stack web dev are\n\n- How components work\n- Hooks\n- Props\n- Virtual Dom\n- Backend routing\n- CRUD operations\n- Error handling\n- Project structure\n\nI have stuff such as custom middleware, auth and more to learn which I have plans for. Along with this I am also studying nextjs for SEO which react lacks in. \n\nIt feels like I have put so much effort into learning all this because I know a lot of people who don’t even code outside uni despite having a passion for cs. But at the same time there are students who I work with at uni who feel so much more ahead of me and much more prepared for this industry. Yes I know comparison is the theft of joy. But I feel like it’s just unavoidable. \n\nAt the same time with all the LLMs going around and vibe coding, I see students who vibe code websites under a day which would take me at least a few days to create all while them not even having a grasp of what the code is about. So it really defeats the purpose of putting all that effort into studying all that. \n\nWhat would you do this in my situation? I genuinely have an interest for software dev and don’t want to switch careers this late. \n",

My issue is that I can’t seem to decide on one. I enjoy working with all of them, and whenever I spend a few hours coding in one language, I get the urge to switch to another cool language. Right now, I’ve got my eye on C++.\n\nI’m not sure where I want to go professionally, which makes it hard for me to choose a language, since I can’t even decide on a specific field.\n\nI find embedded systems and backend/cloud very exciting. ML also seems interesting, but probably involves too much math (I do like math, but I probably do not like it enough for that).\n\nIs there anyone here who has been in a similar situation?  \nI’m not switching languages because I find them hard or don’t enjoy them. I love them all — and hate myself for it :(\n\nEvery field and language I’ve explored is exciting to me. But now that I’m close to finishing my bachelor’s degree, I feel like I’m wasting time by constantly switching between them.\n\nI jump from one thing to another so often that I end up feeling paralyzed when it comes to making a decision — and in the end, I barely get around to actually coding anymore.",

        "content": "Hello :)\n\nBit of a context, I graduated from IT highschool and now I am first year undergraduate studying bioinformatics. I know a bit of C, C#, Java and Python. In school, I always excelled at tasks \"this is goal\", but when we had a \"do a project of your choice\", I struggled and done something super simple. \n\nI think I am decent at figuring how to reach a goal someone else gave me. But I realised I have no clue how to use what I write outside of the pressing \"run\" in the IDE. \n\nBest example:  \nI wanna make a mp3 out of Pi zero. I already done python youtube downloader a while ago. But when I want to run it, I go into PyCharm, press run, paste the link into the terminal and it works. But now I want to make a bash sctipt that I will call with alias + the link and I want the bash script to use the python code and then send the sound file into the Pi. But... How do I use the python code passivly? Aka how do I input the link from outside? how do I run it? How do I know the sound is downloaded and is ready to be sent?\n\nI am not necesserily looking for answer for This One Example. Because it's far from the only time I have no clue how to apply my code. And I can probably solve it with some googling. But the example shows a massive hole in my knowlage. A hole I have no clue how to start patching, and I feel like school won't help me patch it either. Is there a way to start learning how to use the code I write? Could you maybe give me some ideas for projects that might help me learn so?\n\nLuckly, bioinformatics is the one direction where these fancy printf statements might be enough... But it's not enough for me.\n\nThank you for your time reading this and any advices.",

        "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI've been on reddit for a while, mostly just reading and learning from other people's stories. But now, I finally decided to write my own post to share my journey and ask for some honest advice about my career path. **If you've been through something similar or just want to share your stories, I'd really appreciate it.**\n\n**Warning: wall of text.**\n\nI graduated in 2018 with a degree in Software Engineering from a university (not top tier). The program was mostly practical, not too much theory. At that time, the job market in tech was really good.\n\nI started working at a few software outsourcing companies, focused on web dev. Because of the nature of the projects, I had to work with many different technologies. I think this is one of the biggest differences between outsourcing companies and product companies. I didn't get a chance to go deep into any technology, as soon as I started to get familiar with something, I had to switch to something else.\n\nAlso, many of my friends were working at big companies and making a lot of money. That made me feel peer-pressured and pushed me to switch jobs often, chasing better pay, even though my skills weren't really strong enough to match those expectations.\n\nOver time, I started feeling lost and didn't know what I was working toward anymore. I also started to lose motivation, so I made a big decision to go study abroad for 2 years, hoping to find a new direction and more opportunities. I guess this is another big mistake that I made.\n\nWith how tough the job market is right now, I've spent long time doing self-reflection. I realized that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Sometimes we don't appreciate what we already have until it's gone. And I've learned that success takes real effort and time, there are no shortcuts. If I had worked continuously since graduation, I would have over 7 YOE by now, but because of many breaks and job changes, I still feel like I'm only at a mid-level, not senior yet. I'm still afraid to apply for senior roles.",

        "author": "franzz4",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So, I started learning programming last December with Python. Since then, I’ve studied several programming languages like C, Rust, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Flutter (Dart). I tried out different languages used in different areas, such as back-end (C, Rust, Python, and JavaScript), front-end (HTML/CSS and JavaScript), and mobile (Kotlin and Flutter). After testing several different areas, here’s the conclusion I came to:\n\n**Front-end and Mobile:** It’s fun and interesting, but I don’t really see myself working professionally with UI — only in personal projects. The languages are manageable, but the problem is that there are thousands of frameworks that do the same thing, and the job market expects you to know several (especially in Web). In the end, it’s hard to pick one to focus on and really master.\n\n**Back-end:** I found it really fun to work with connections, APIs, databases, JSON, and making the project work behind the scenes. The languages are good (some are hard), and there are several options as well. However, it’s easier to pick one or two languages to specialize in back-end than it is in front-end. That’s why I decided to focus on back-end.\n\nAfter learning the basics of programming, like: programming logic, algorithms, data structures, and Git/GitHub, I’d like to ask for your opinion — **which language do you recommend I focus on right now?**  \nFrom what I’ve seen, the most recommended ones are:\n\n* Python\n* Java\n* C#\n* Go\n* Rust\n\nI was thinking about going back to Python and Rust since I already have some background with them, but I’d love to hear your opinions.",

We're aiming for a project that reflects our combined skill sets and demonstrates our ability to build full-stack, user-friendly, and intelligent systems.\n\nWe’re open to ideas in areas like:\n\n* Real-world problem solving\n* AI-powered mobile applications\n* Cybersecurity/privacy-focused tools\n* Projects with social, environmental, or educational impact\n\nIf you’ve built something similar, or you’ve seen ideas that could fit a team like ours, we’d love to hear them! Our goal is to make something that not only fulfills academic requirements but also helps us stand out when job hunting.\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions!",

        "content": "Hi, I'm fairly inexperienced with backend stuff and am trying to learn a little right now. I have a Frontend Angular application hosted on Github pages right now, and from what I understand, Github pages does not allow any backend hosting because it is completely static, but I should be able to call the backend from my application if the backend is hosted somewhere else correct? And from that backend (let's say it's hosted for free on Vercel), I should be able to make automatic daily API calls with a cron job and store that data on a database that can be used whenever I make a request from my frontend? \n\nSo in short, I'm just trying to wrap my head around the front end back end interaction. From my understanding, it's basically: Github Front End HTTP request to Back End hosted not on github, then the backend sends back some queried data from the database that is automatically updating every day?\n\n",

Due to the unreliability of our network, we sometime can drop for a few seconds before connection is reestablished.\n\nRight now we are using TCP sockets to establish communications and communicate, sending the data as a single Json object (made before I got there).\n\nWe have a second remote facility being built right now, so we want to improve these performances and fine tune our software before it is completed and in operation.\n\n## Questions\n\nOur main goal right now is to improve the reliability of our data.\nSince we cannot do much in terms of the actual communications, we were thinking about using a more reliable/resilient protocol like MQTT, or maybe NATS, but we don't have any experience with them. Would these be good options?\n\nWhat are some options for distributed systems with unreliable connections and low bandwidth?",

I can see you reading your responses off a screen, and you know what… that’s fine.  You maybe had some canned answers ready.\n\nI ask you follow up questions and you need a minute to think, that’s great.  Take your time.  I can even pretend not to notice you obviously typing something while you “think”, maybe you are taking notes.\n\nBut if I ask you about your experiences, or why you wrote what you did or said what you did, you *must* be able to answer that question.  If I ask you why you used a loop there, you need to be able to explain your choice.  If I ask you how you solved that bug you are bragging about, you have to be able to walk me through it.\n\nIn short: I’m happy to pretend like you aren’t using an AI assist in your interviews if you can keep up the illusion.   But people who have actual skills and experiences can go from pleasant high-level summaries down several layers into explaining the details of what they understand.  Solving a difficult bug leaves a mark on your soul you don’t forget the details.  If I get a word salad of tech jargon as an answer, and every follow up question is a new word salad of jargon, i can’t hire you, because you give me nothing to work with.\n\nI don’t know who needs to hear this, but if you want to interview successfully you need to be able to speak coherently like a human about your own choices.

I've only been working as a software engineer for a year at a small, random company, but I'm a pretty social person so I had no trouble chatting with them about life, tech, and just having interesting convos.\n\nAt one point I mentioned that I was open to new opportunities and even moving countries, and a bunch of them were like \"we'd love to have someone like you on our team.\" I ended up getting a few LinkedIns out of it.\n\nWhat surprised me is none of them really knew anything about my technical skills. I wasn’t trying to sell myself or anything, just being myself. It kind of made me realise that whole saying about \"it's who you know\" might actually be true.\n\nCurious what others think about that. Does being social and making connections really matter that much in this field, even more than raw skills sometimes?",

        "content": "Basically, I have been in this field for 6-7 years now. Mostly as a full stack developer. I am not new to this field and even with that I am just tired of this field.\n\nI felt it might get better, but I feel it has only gotten worse. Started in this field a little before COVID hit and heard that is when things started going downhill in this field (outside that window of massive hiring for 1.5 year) around then. My experience backs this.\n\nThe expectations in this field are insane and none of my friends in other fields come close to putting up with this. The interview process is out of control and much of it has nothing to do with on the job stuff. So you have to learn on your own these things to do the interviews. The expectations while you have a job are insane. You are mostly led by non-technical people who fail to grasp how complex what they are asking you to do is and unrealistic deadlines because they are too scared to tell their managers no.\n\nAlso, endless learning new stupid languages and stacks because someone in the world just has to create \"another language\" for their own ego, that ultimately does not make anything easier. Just makes it a new thing you have to learn.\n\nNevermind the horrible job market in tech specifically. Endless layoffs, one of the highest unemployment rates of any white collar job field (we are higher than the average now), and clear attempts to send any new jobs overseas. So you can't even get a chance to compete for those jobs that go abroad.\n\nUltimately I'm just over it. I'm done. I want out. I just don't see a future in this field anymore.\n\nWhat are some realistic paths I can take to get out of this field given my CS degree and experience? I'm ok with going back to school or pay for some training if it means there is a realistic path to getting employment. As long as it won't take more than 2 years. Ideally 1 year. Open to any idea though. I'm ok taking a paycut too, anything in 80k-100k pay range is ok with me.\n\nI'm just over it. What are my options? Does anyone have any suggestions?",

He quickly joined a small startup to avoid a career gap. It was okay initially, but things have gone downhill: his manager now micromanages heavily, expects engineers to be in the office five days a week, and keeps track of in-and-out times. On top of that, he’s being paid only $76k despite having over 4 years of experience.\n\nHe’s been trying to prepare for new roles, but the current environment is draining him. The manager constantly demeans him, and he dreads going to work. He wishes he had more time and headspace to focus on interviews.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation—left a job like this (even in this tough market) and not looked back?",

After taking a few months off to work on a passion project, I'm realizing it's likely not going to produce income soon enough for my family, so I'm reentering the salaried job market.\n\nPrior to this I was staff engineer at a public tech company, and prior to that I was CTO of a startup which was acquired by that tech company, so I haven't done any interviewing myself for over 10 years. During that time I would say about half was hands on engineering (coding, submitting or reviewing PRs) and half on architecture/leadership.\n\nIn conversations with recruiters, I have been forthright in my inexperience interviewing, saying things like I don't expect to do well on things like LeetCode interviews. Most of the recruiters I've spoken to say \"oh, we don't do LeetCode interviews here.\" You know, they want to sound _different than the other companies_. However, the very next call I have with the company will be a tech screen where I am asked to do a LeetCode style puzzle, and inevitably I bomb. \n\nThere are many factors here--I am self taught--and I discovered have more test anxiety than I realized. Also, these \"problems\" are often just little puzzles that I've rarely if ever seen in my 25 years of software engineering, so I am simply rusty at solving them in the allotted time. My problem solving may also follow a non-traditional sequence that the interviewer is simply not used to seeing (like, incorrect \"order of operations\" even though I solve the problem).\n\nRegardless of whether the companies are saying they do LeetCode style questions or not, it seems like I have no choice but to grind it out until I can pass these silly interviews. I'm curious if that is what other people are experiencing? Like, there are obviously ways to get much better signal from candidates--and as a hiring manager for many many years I've developed my own preferences--but as a candidate it seems I can't influence the process at all. \n\nI'm curious what the fine folks here would say. Do I just suck it up and grind LC? Have people found success asking for alternative interviews like take-homes, PR reviews, peer coding, etc? Are there companies that I should be looking at? \n\nAnyway, thanks for listening and for any feedback or advice you can offer. Best of luck out there on your interview loops!",

Based on convos with the teams, WLB at Google should be solid for the foreseeable future. WLB @ Meta should be comparable for the first year or so, but it sounds like on-call could get rough after that (specifically the on-call severity may worsen next year).\n\nComplicating things, I’ve already signed with Meta.

Yet it all feels useless in this current time. Makes me wonder if my school's ranking has been my limiter.\n\nI know other people are going through very similar things, yet when someone vents about their struggles on this Subreddit, it's experienced devs currently in the industry regurgitating LinkedIn advice that many of us have tried with no results. In fact, they start to just assume things about the poster and call them a doomer, when all they want to do is be heard. I do agree that some posts are outlandish, and the poster has a poorly written resume or something, but there are many of us who just want to be encouraged to keep going, or receive advice + reality checks of the current market that will actually help us calculate next steps. I try to scroll this Subreddit every day to see if there's encouragement or good advice, but a lot of it is really just putting hard and smart workers looking to just get an opportunity down for not being hardworking or smart enough.\n\n  \nIdk, the more that I keep going with no results, the more I feel helpless. At least I want to build / look for a community that can support each other's struggles during these tough times. However, I do understand that many devs who are already in the industry are annoyed by the helpless and doomer posts.

I just graduated and of course I don’t need to rely on them for happiness because one day they may not be there, but just sitting on my ass alone all weekend like I did during college, WITH my current job would kill me.\n\nFor all of my peers and project partners I would always spend time with them outside of class because I knew how it felt to want to just go to the movies or to a bar with someone just to not end up being alone. My current job is software support being crosstrained in development, so i’m not even truly into development yet but I still get stressed out regardless. The client end of things is a lot to deal with.\n\nFor so many students and post I know, they are spending so much time on side projects and slowly giving themselves anxiety by spending all their time not studying or working by grinding, I tell them to go out and do things with people they like. For me, when I get a good reset, I get more productive. I am not someone who can just go on and on, although I know some who can. I’ve also seen people lose really good friends by losing themselves in the grind. Wouldn’t recommend it.\n\n",

The work is more niche (GPU driver, kernel debugging).\n* Option 2: Higher paid position at a different company where I'd be working on a modern C++ codebase (the company is smaller and isn't as well known but the staff is apparently quite elite). After one year they allow remote work + give a significant raise in salary.\n\nThe key issue here is that the first role is almost exclusively focused on debugging driver/GPU issues and there is little to no implementation to be done. I imagine that I would become something of a linux kernel / GPU driver guru after some time of doing this kind of work.\n\nThe other role pays better (especially after the one year re-negotiation) and allows for remote work but it's more of a regular C++ SWE engineering implementation job, after a year this would be \\~45k euro at google (net of tax) vs \\~75k euro (net of tax) at the other company.\n\nMy two questions to people who have experience in the industry are:\n\n1. Would having google in my CV have a significant impact on my career compared to experience at some other company?\n2. Could doing no implementation and essentially only debugging be dertimental to my engineering skills or actually help me grow? I will add that I already know C++ pretty well so I don't believe I could grow all that much in terms of pure C++ skills.\n\nI would really appreciate some input.",

So, the solution is to do research or some bullshit security training that's required every year until the sprint ends, essentially wasting 2-3 days a sprint.\n\nI have worked here since graduating college (<5 years), get paid (\\~85k / year, no bonus, no stock), and have good benefits (unlimited PTO, fully remote).\n\nThat being said, I feel like my skills have been degrading year after year, and I'm really fed up with the red tape of this job. The work I complete has been basically the exact same for my entire time here, and having to spend 5-10 days a month \"doing my own research\" is not helping.  \n  \nIs it ridiculous to be looking for a new job?

The demos made it look like you’d just write a prompt and it would crank out production-ready code with perfect architecture. Even our CTO was pushing us to “experiment aggressively.”\n\nAnd sure sometimes it does help. Boilerplate, tests, refactors I’m too lazy to do at 11 PM. No complaints there.\n\nBut for real design or new features? It’s like pair programming with an overeager intern who refuses to say “I don’t know.” It’ll confidently scaffold something that compiles but is subtly wrong in ways that bite you later. Error handling missing. Boundaries between services fuzzy. Or it’ll suggest a “quick fix” that completely ignores the ADR you spent two days writing.\n\nIt’s not just that it’s wrong sometimes but it’s that it’s convincingly wrong. Which is worse than useless when you’re moving fast.\n\nI’ve even had to consciously dial back my use of it on one of our event-driven services because I noticed I was rubber-stamping suggestions instead of thinking about the architecture myself. \n\nAnyway just curious if anyone else has had the same arc. I’m not anti-AI. It’s staying in my toolbox. But I’m starting to treat it more like Stack Overflow: amazing for hints, dangerous for blind copy-paste.\n\nWould love to hear how others are using it day-to-day, especially in non-trivial codebases.\n\n",

I basically just backed out of the whole process and told them I didn't appreciate having that change sprung on me last second. \n\nI wasn't super psyched about the position to begin with, so it didn't bother me to back out, but not sure I handled it the right way. Friends are saying I should have just done it and worst case I would have been rejected or just said no to the offer if it came to it.",

The problem is that I recognize that I don't really have the depth of knowledge that would typically qualify me for a Senior Developer/Engineer role in other companies. \n\nI know our tech stack, but when I find myself in conversations about new system design, or just more technical concepts in general, I'm quickly in over my head compared to colleagues that have CS degrees, where software conversations seem to evolve into higher-order maths concepts that I've simply got no familiarity with, or understanding of.  \n\nI've made it this far in life without obtaining even an associates degree, and I really have no interest in starting from the beginning on the path to a comp sci degree, but I feel like I would really benefit from a \"computer science crash course\" geared towards devs that could build a foundational knowledge base for system design. \n\nDoes something like that exist that you can point me towards?\n\nTLDR: I don't want to go to college, but I want to develop my understanding of computer science concepts as a developer to improve my system design capabilities.

When I recieved my offer letter for a full time position, I had just failed my FE test and got low-balled (in my opinion). A job was better than no job at the time. I then recieved all the benefit paperwork and my jaw fell to the floor (not good). I have continuously applied to other jobs and will likely start hearing back soon.\n\nI love the substance of the work but do not feel valued at this company. Since being an intern, I feel \"stuck\" on the bottom of the superiority totem pole. Our industry has been getting worse and worse, and layoffs will start soon. I have been told I will NOT be the first to go, because I am the lowest paid engineer with the highest potential. I understand from the company's point of view but out of self respect, I would like to be valued more someplace else.\n\nIs it a respectful choice to make a year or two with the company, or just ride where the wind takes me?\n\n\\*Note: I am aware I got low-balled because my \"best office friend\" is another department head. My boss flips over the paper when it comes around to discussion of my salary. He knows it will come back to me and doesnt want anyone to know I accepted something so low. At the time I had no leverage. I turned away 3 other offers prior to signing this one, before realizing the benefits were worse. ",

But the reality is that I have to always be ready for something to happen. I’ve worked in 3 different positions since graduating, and all had on-call rotations. It feels like it’s everywhere for systems engineers.\n\nIt feels so aggravating at times. For one out of every 4 weeks, I can’t go out to dinner, I can’t go to a concert, I can’t have a few drinks, and I can’t go do fun weekend activities, because I have to be within 15-30 minutes of a response time in the unlikely event that something goes wrong.\n\nUsually, everything is fine, and there are no issues. Which, I’m grateful for. But it feels tough when my friends want to plan to go to the beach with our boyfriends on a Saturday, and I have to say no because I need to be somewhere with WiFi in case things go awry.\n\nIt feels like such a champagne problem; I’m making more than double what any of my other friends make, and I have more money saved for retirement than most people 10 years older than me do. So it feels incredibly entitled to be bitching about this. But I feel like I’m constantly avoiding fun things during my “free time” because I need to be ready for a server to go down that most likely will not go down.",

During my masters I started to go down the self-taught dev route. Now I have been working for 2 years as IT consultant and software developer in an enterprise environment (Java Spring Boot). Currently self-studying CS fundamentals through teachyourselfcs.com (working through CS:APP right now). I'm aware I have some gaps in my CS knowledge, which is why I started the self-study route. Now I'm considering going back to university for a CS Bachelor's degree (would do it part-time while keeping my full-time job. Studying evenings/weekends. Would be at a \"Hochschule\" that costs 19k€).\n\nThe thing is, I could spend those 3.5 years on getting the CS Bachelor's degree OR continuing self-study, building projects, gaining more work experience and getting certifications.\n\nFrom a career perspective, my main question is: What looks better in the (European) job market:\n\n1. Having that CS degree on paper after already working in the field\n2. Having no CS degree, but a few certificates and a couple personal projects and focusing more on my career in the current company.\n\nI'm genuinely torn. Part of me wants the \"proper\" CS foundation and having something to show for it, but another part thinks that time could be better invested in practical experience and targeted learning. Also I would basically just do it for the \"academic proof\" for future employers, as I think that some of the stuff learned during the CS-degree is not practical and the important topics are also learnable by self-study, as I am currently doing.\n\nAnyone been in a similar situation? How did it work out? Would love to hear thoughts from both hiring managers and developers who've taken either path.\n\nThanks!",

Can you recommend something, either for just React for now, or for React + Node? I was thinking of anything I can complete within a few weeks, ideally not much more than that.\n\nSo far I've been considering Meta's [React Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/meta-react-specialization) on Coursera, or maybe IBM's [JavaScript Programming with React, Node & MongoDB Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/javascript-programming-with-react-node-mongodb?specialization=meta-front-end-developer), also on Coursera. Someone else on a different subreddit recommended the [Full Stack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course from the University of Helsinki, which looks comprehensive and touches many modern technologies I am not familiar with, but which could be overkill for someone who is already a developer, I guess.\n\nPlease, I know it might be a boring question, but can you please offer some guidance? Again, what I want is:\n\n* Learning about React and Node (or, first one thing and then the other one) \n* A reputable certificate to add to my resume and Linkedin profile \n* Ideally, an endeavor that requires not more than a few weeks (a couple of months would be my absolute max)",

Don't really like the job and my team isn't technical at all.\n\n# Option 2: Move to Canada for Waterloo’s in-person MEng (includes a co-op term)\n\n* **Cost:** Tuition plus rent and living costs in Waterloo, so I would burn savings (but I can afford it)\n* **Upside:** Waterloo’s name carries weight, and the co-op cycle should drop me into genuine dev roles and help me build a network in Canadian tech\n* **Downside:** Two years of full-time study at age 24, plus the chance I still end up fighting for the same entry-level SWE spots afterward.

This week I was asked if I wanted to stay in my current division for the fall because the new division I applied for did not have openings. I was kind of rushed to answer, so I agreed. \n\nMy question is if I find something at some point in the fall, early or later on, will I be burning bridges by ending this internship? I was told that I could apply for the other division in the spring…so is a bad idea to leave and try and come back?\n\nI don’t think anyone in particular will have strong feelings since it’s a government agency. But I do feel bad that someone could have gotten my spot if I had left earlier. \n\nI feel like it’s a common understanding that interns take any opportunities they can, so would it be that bad?\n\nAny advice is appreciated!

After a technical undergrad degree, I've worked for 10+ years, and am looking to upskill and re-focus towards ML/AI, to help with a future career pivot. \n\nMy understanding is that for undergrad, and probably any non-research Master's degree, the (at least perceived) school quality/ranking is very important. \n\nWhat about for a PhD though? Or a research-based Master's degree? My brief understanding is that here things get blurry because it's more about finding a specific research supervisor and field of research, rather than just trying to get into the highest ranking school you can. \n\nOf course we need a criterion, so I'd say something like 'future career prospect maximization'. \n\nMy concern is that as a mature student with a likely weaker applicant profile, I would probably get into a lower ranking school than my undergrad school. So would that end up looking weak on my resume? What should I consider here? \n\nHappy to try and answer any clarifying questions, and hopefully this topic will be useful for others as well.

I was a whole week late to finish up my part of the patches on the 2 networks I do it on. Not to mention, a few updates from these patches can be moved very easily without the drive and I usually move those first anyway and for some reason, I waited till I got the drive to do those too! I assumed the security office only had 1 drive but I JUST went and asked them and they have 3 apparently! I should have done this before.\n\nMy boss wasn't very happy and there is a meeting with a few members on the team in 1-2 weeks to discuss patching. I feel like this will reflect really poorly on me. My boss also asked that I create an email chain so we all keep track of patching progress in July, so I've been working extra fast to get them all done this month! I hope they don't ask me what I was doing during that one week delay in June because that was 2 weeks ago and I have no idea why I wasn't more proactive. How badly do you think this can affect me? ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "When it comes to transferring from PhD and post PhD research in academic based institutions to industry based science, there's major discussion in terms of how everything from the pace of work to the lack of ability to ensure the best methods are being used and so on. So when it comes to adapting the skills obtained during a PhD and in me cases research assistantships past the PhD, and convincing others that you can transfer your skills, what works best?\n\nWith some companies, particularly in this economic climate, they'll be looking for industry experience and that's it. It won't matter about published papers and successful projects. It won't matter if much of your research is in an applicable field such as data science. Side projects you've done independently may not even matter. It has to be experience in industry or it doesn't count. And often, it needs to be with the exact software tools, models and packages they use in addition.\n\nThat said, I was wondering about what works when adapting your skills and also making the case to others about how you can do so. A primary option, I imagine, is being able to relate to them, for example how a paper and project you finished has implications that could assist them with their data handling, product development and so on. Or perhaps reaching out and explaining concisely how the skills you developed, even though they weren't directly in industry, could be applied to solve a problem they have.\n\nAre there methods and techniques similar to this that work?",

        "author": "ThomasHawl",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a 28-year-old who finished my MSc in Mathematics around 18 months ago. After graduation, I briefly worked as a paid researcher at my university, then struggled to find the right job. About three months ago, I joined Accenture out of financial necessity, but the job was completely non-technical, focused mostly on strategic consulting, presentations, and PowerPoint—basically everything I don’t enjoy. I recently quit this position.\n\nI now managed to land a technical role as an Embedded Software Engineer at a large multinational aerospace and defense company. Even though embedded development isn't directly aligned with my studies, I really enjoy programming, problem-solving, and low-level technical challenges, so I'm genuinely excited about the new role.\n\nHowever, I found out that the tech stack relies heavily on C and ADA, which, at least from my perspective, seem somewhat outdated. My main reasons for accepting this role were:\n\n1. Escaping traditional strategic consulting (like Accenture's). Even though technically it's still consulting (body rental), at least now I'll focus on one specific technical project instead of juggling multiple non-technical tasks.\n2. The company offers strong international mobility opportunities (Europe, Asia, USA), which align closely with my personal and professional priorities.\n\nMy longer-term goals aren’t completely clear yet—I initially thought I’d stay in academia and research (ML), but now I'm more inclined toward working on low-level, latency-sensitive projects, ideally using innovative technologies in C++ or Rust. I'm also quite interested in quantitative finance or joining Big Tech companies primarily due to their innovation. Given my math and ML background, roles involving machine learning or deep learning also seem appealing.\n\nI’d also love to explore high-performance systems programming or low-level AI infrastructure (Linux kernel dev, robotics, or high-frequency trading infrastructure among other things). However, I'm not sure how easy it'll be to pivot from ADA/C embedded roles into such fields. I’d prefer avoiding anything frontend or web development-related.\n\nIn my free time, I'm actively studying C++ and Rust, deepening my knowledge of ML frameworks I've previously used at university (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and contributing to open-source projects, though my free time is currently limited. I’ve considered pursuing certifications but I'm not sure they're valuable enough on a CV.\n\nGiven this context, my main questions for you are:\n\n* **Would you recommend sticking to embedded software (C/ADA) for at least 1–2 years before trying to pivot into a more modern software engineering field (e.g., C++, Rust, or ML infrastructure), or should I aim to switch sooner?**\n* **Are there examples of people successfully moving from ADA/C embedded roles into fields like Linux kernel development, robotics, Rust systems development, or similar areas?**\n* **Is my fear of being \"stuck\" justified, or will my embedded experience still be highly valued and easily transferable?**\n\nAny advice, experiences, or insights would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!",
