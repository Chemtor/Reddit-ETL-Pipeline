        "content": "We are hiring for a data engineering position, and I am responsible for the technical portion of the screening process. \n\nIt’s pretty basic verbal stuff, explain the different sql joins, explain CTEs, explain Python function vs generator, followed by some very easy functional programming in python and some spark. \n\nAnyway — back to my story. \n\nI hop onto the meeting and introduce myself and ask some warm up questions about their background, etc. Immediately I notice this person’s head moves a LOT when they talk. And it moves in this… odd kind of way… and it does the same kind of movement over and over again. Odd, but I keep going. At one point this…  agent…. Talks for about 2 min straight without taking a single breath or even sounding short of breath, which was incredibly jarring. \n\nThen we get into the actual technical exercise. I ask them to find a small bug in some python code that is just making a very simple API call. It’s a small syntax error, very basic, easy to miss but running the script and reading the error message spells it out for you. This agent starts explaining that the defect is due to a failure to authenticate with this api endpoint, which is not true at all. But the agent starts going into GREAT detail on how rest authentication works using oAuth tokens (which it wasn’t even using), and how that is the issue. Without even trying to run it. \n\nSo I ask “interesting can you walk me through the code and explain how you identified that as the issue?” And it just repeats everything it just said a minute ago. I ask it again to try and explain the code to me and to fix the code. It starts saying the same thing a third time, then it drops entirely from the call. \n\n\nSo I spent about 30 minutes today talking to someone’s scammer AI agent who somehow got their way past the basic HR screening. \n\nThis is the world we are living in. \n\nThis is not an advertisement for a position, please don’t ask me about the position, the intent of this post is just to share this experience with other professionals and raise some awareness to be careful with these interviews. If you contact me about this position, I promise I will just delete the message. Sorry. \n\n\nI very much wish I could have interviewed a real person instead of wasting 30 minutes of my time 😔 \n",

        "content": "Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about how often companies use Spark by default — especially now that tools like Databricks make it so easy to spin up a cluster. But in many cases, the data volume isn’t that big, and the complexity doesn’t seem to justify all the overhead.\n\nThere are now tools like DuckDB, Polars, and even pandas (with proper tuning) that can process hundreds of millions of rows in-memory on a single machine. They’re fast, simple to set up, and often much cheaper. Yet Spark remains the go-to option for a lot of teams, maybe just because “it scales” or because everyone’s already using it.\n\nSo I’m wondering:\n\t•\tHow big does your data actually need to be before Spark makes sense?\n\t•\tWhat should I really be asking myself before reaching for distributed processing?",

        "author": "caiopizzol",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Ever tried loading 85GB of government data with encoding issues, broken foreign keys, and dates from 2027? Welcome to my world processing Brazil's entire company registry.\n\n# The Challenge\n\nBrazil publishes monthly snapshots of every registered company - that's 50+ million businesses, 60+ million establishments, and 20+ million partnership records. The catch? ISO-8859-1 encoding, semicolon delimiters, decimal commas, and a schema that's evolved through decades of legacy systems.\n\n# What I Built\n\n[**CNPJ Data Pipeline**](https://github.com/cnpj-chat/cnpj-data-pipeline) \\- A Python pipeline that actually handles this beast intelligently:\n\n    # Auto-detects your system and adapts strategy\n    Memory < 8GB: Streaming with 100k chunks\n    Memory 8-32GB: 2M record batches  \n    Memory > 32GB: 5M record parallel processing\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Smart chunking** \\- Processes files larger than available RAM without OOM\n* **Resilient downloads** \\- Retry logic for unstable government servers\n* **Incremental processing** \\- Tracks processed files, handles monthly updates\n* **Database abstraction** \\- Clean adapter pattern (PostgreSQL implemented, MySQL/BigQuery ready for contributions)\n\n# Hard-Won Lessons\n\n**1. The database is always the bottleneck**\n\n    # This is 10x faster than INSERT\n    COPY table FROM STDIN WITH CSV\n    \n    # But for upserts, staging tables beat everything\n    INSERT INTO target SELECT * FROM staging\n    ON CONFLICT UPDATE\n\n**2. Government data reflects history, not perfection**\n\n* \\~2% of economic activity codes don't exist in reference tables\n* Some companies are \"founded\" in the future\n* Double-encoded UTF-8 wrapped in Latin-1 (yes, really)\n\n**3. Memory-aware processing saves lives**\n\n    # Don't do this with 2GB files\n    df = pd.read_csv(huge_file)  # 💀\n    \n    # Do this instead\n    for chunk in pl.read_csv_lazy(huge_file):\n        process_and_forget(chunk)\n\n# Performance Numbers\n\n* VPS (4GB RAM): \\~12 hours for full dataset\n* Standard server (16GB): \\~3 hours\n* Beefy box (64GB+): \\~1 hour\n\nThe beauty? It adapts automatically. No configuration needed.\n\n# The Code\n\nBuilt with modern Python practices:\n\n* Type hints everywhere\n* Proper error handling with exponential backoff\n* Comprehensive logging\n* Docker support out of the box\n\n&#8203;\n\n    # One command to start\n    docker-compose --profile postgres up --build\n\n# Why Open Source This?\n\nAfter spending months perfecting this pipeline, I realized every Brazilian startup, researcher, and data scientist faces the same challenge. Why should everyone reinvent this wheel?\n\nThe code is MIT licensed and ready for contributions. Need MySQL support? Want to add BigQuery? The adapter pattern makes it straightforward.\n\n**GitHub**: [https://github.com/cnpj-chat/cnpj-data-pipeline](https://github.com/cnpj-chat/cnpj-data-pipeline)\n\nSometimes the best code is the code that handles the messy reality of production data. This pipeline doesn't assume perfection - it assumes chaos and deals with it gracefully. Because in data engineering, resilience beats elegance every time.",

In my experience is really hard to test sql scripts, usually sql files are giant blocks of code that need to be tested at once. Something we like about tools like pandas is that we can apply testing strategies from the software developers world without to much extra work and in at any kind of granularity we want. \n\nHow are you implementing data pipelines with DuckDB and how are you testing them? Is it possible to have testing practices similar to those in the software development world?",

        "author": "godz_ares",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey all,\n\n[https://github.com/RubelAhmed10082000/CragWeatherDatabase](https://github.com/RubelAhmed10082000/CragWeatherDatabase)\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any feedback and any recommendations to improve my code. I was especially wondering whether a DuckDB database was the right way to go.  I am still learning and developing my understanding of ETL concepts. There's an explanation below but feel free to ignore if you don't want to read too much. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nMy project's goal is to allow rock climbers to better plan their outdoor climbing sessions based on which locations have the best weather (e.g. no precipitation, not too cold etc.).\n\nCurrently I have the ETL pipeline sorted out.\n\nThe rock climbing location Dataframe contains data such as the name of the location, the name of the routes, the difficulty of the routes as well as the safety grade where relevant. It also contains the type of rock (if known) and the type of climb.\n\nThis data was scraped by a Redditor I met called u/AmbitiousTie, who gave a helping hand by scraping UKC, a very famous rock climbing website. I can't claim credit for this. \n\nI wrote some code to normalize and clean the Dataframe. Some changes I made was dropping some columns, changing the datatypes, removing nulls etc. Each row pertains to a singular route. With over 120,000 rows of data.\n\nI used the longitude and latitude of my climbing Dataframe as an argument for my Weather API call. I used OpenMeteo free tier API as it is extremely generous. Currently, the code only fetches weather data for only 50 climbing locations. But when the API is called without this limitation it has over 710,000 rows of data. While this does take a long time but I can use pagination on my endpoint to only call the weather data for the locations that is currently being seeing by the user at a single time..\n\nI used Great-Expectations to validate both Dataframe at both a schema, row and column level.  \n\nI loaded both Dataframe into an in-memory DuckDB database, following the schema seen below (but without the dimDateTime table). Credit to u/No-Adhesiveness-6921 for recommending this schema. I used DuckDB because it was the easiest to use - I tried setting up a PostgreSQL database but ended up with errors and got frustrated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vkb85ebk7y6f1.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f13454a40df069957a5aaec7b2df111830c316\n\nI used Airflow to orchestrate the pipeline. The pipeline is run every day at 1AM to ensure the weather data is up to data. Currently the DAG involves one instance which encapsulates the entire ETL pipeline. However, I plan to modularize my DAGs in the future. I am just finding it hard to find a way to process Dataframe from one instance to another.\n\nDocker was used for virtualisation to get the Airflow to run.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rpquq7c8y6f1.png?width=1351&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c3720d0188006c25aabbf9931956bb63cf98637\n\nI also used pytest for both unit testing and features testing.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI am planning on increasing the size of my climbing data. Maybe all the climbing locations in Europe, then the world. This will probably require Spark and some threading as well. \n\nI also want to create an endpoint and I am planning on learning FastAPI to do this but others have recommended Flask or Django\n\n**Challenges:**\n\nDocker - Docker is a pain in the ass to setup and is as close to black magic as I have come in my short coding journey.\n\nGreat Expectations - I do not like this package. While flexible and having a great library of expectations, is is extremely cumbersome. I have to add expectations to a suite one by one. This will be a bottleneck in the future for sure. Also getting your data setup to be validated is convoluted. It also didn't play well with Airflow. I couldn't get the validation operator to work due to an import error. I also couldn't get data docs to work either. As a result I had to integrate validations directly into my ETL code and the user is forced to scour the .json file to find why a certain validation failed. I am actively searching for a replacement.",

        "content": "Hi !\n\nI know this isn't a UI subreddit, but wanted to share something here.\n\nI've been working in the data space for the past 7 years and have been extremely frustrated by the lack of good UI/UX. lots of stuff is purely programatic, super static, slow, etc. Probably some of the worst UI suites out there.\n\nI've been working on an interface to work with data interactively, with as little latency as possible. To make it ***feel*** instant.\n\nWe accidentally built an insanely fast rendering mechanism for large tables. I found it to be so fast that I was curious to see how much I could throw at it...\n\nSo I shoved in 100 million rows (and 16 columns) of test data...\n\nThe results... well... even surprised me...\n\n[100 million rows preview](https://reddit.com/link/1lb13ep/video/yeivgrn7wt6f1/player)\n\n*This is a development build, which is not available yet, but wanted show here first...*\n\nOnce the data loaded (which did take some time) the scrolling performance was buttery smooth. My MacBook's display is 120hz and you cannot feel any slowdown. No lag, super smooth scrolling, and instant calculations if you add a custom column.\n\nFor those curious, the main thread latency for operations like deleting a column, or reordering were between **120µs-300µs**. So that means you hit the keyboard, and it's done. No waiting. Of course this is not for *every* operation, but for the common ones, it's extremely fast.\n\nGetting results for custom columns were **<30ms**, no matter where you were in the table. Any latency you see via ### is just a UI choice we made but will probably change it (it's kinda ugly).\n\n  \n***How did we do this?***\n\nThis technique uses a combination of lazy loading, minimal memory copying, value caching, and GPU accelerated rendering of the cells. Plus some very special sauce I frankly don't want to share ;) To be clear, **this was not easy.**\n\nWe also set out to ensure that we hit a roundtrip time of <33ms UI updates per distinct user action (other than scrolling). This is the threshold for feeling instant.\n\nWe explicitly avoided the use of Javascript and other web technologies, because frankly they're entirely incapable of performance like this.\n\n***Could we do more?***\n\n*Actually, yes.* I have some ideas to make the initial load time even faster, but still experimenting. \n\n  \n***Okay, but is looking at 100 million rows actually useful?***\n\nFor a 100 million rows, honestly, probably not. But who knows ? I know that for smaller datasets, in 10s of millions, I've wanted the ability to look through all the rows to copy certain values, etc.\n\nIn this case, it's kind of just a side-effect of a really well-built rendering architecture ;)\n\nIf you wanted, and you had a really beefy computer, I'm sure you could do 500 million or more with the same performance. Maybe we'll do that someday (?)\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me know what you think. I was thinking about making a more technical write up for those curious...",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/DataEngineering!  \nI’m a master’s student, and I just wrapped up my big data analytics project where I tried to solve a problem I personally care about as a gamer: **how can indie devs make sense of hundreds of thousands of Steam reviews?**\n\nMost tools either don’t scale or aren’t designed with real-time insights in mind. So I built something myself — a **distributed review analysis pipeline** using Dask, PyTorch, and transformer-based NLP models.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n* **Data:** 17M+ Steam reviews (\\~40GB uncompressed), scraped using the Steam API\n* **Hardware:** Ryzen 9 7900X, 32GB RAM, RTX 4080 Super (16GB VRAM)\n* **Goal:** Process massive review datasets quickly and summarize key insights (sentiment + summarization)\n\n**Engineering Challenges (and Lessons):**\n\n1. **Transformer Parallelism Pain:** Initially, each Dask worker loaded its own model — ballooned memory use 6x. Fixed it by loading the model once and passing handles to workers. GPU usage dropped drastically.\n2. **CUDA + Serialization Hell:** Trying to serialize CUDA tensors between workers triggered crashes. Eventually settled on keeping all GPU operations in-place with smart data partitioning + local inference.\n3. **Auto-Hardware Adaptation:** The system detects hardware and:\n   * Spawns optimal number of workers\n   * Adjusts batch sizes based on RAM/VRAM\n   * Falls back to CPU with smaller batches (16 samples) if no GPU\n4. **From 30min to 2min:** For 200K reviews, the pipeline used to take over 30 minutes — now it's down to \\~2 minutes. 15x speedup.\n\n**Dask Architecture Highlights:**\n\n* Dynamic worker spawning\n* Shared model access\n* Fault-tolerant processing\n* Smart batching and cleanup between tasks\n\n**What I’d Love Advice On:**\n\n* Is this architecture sound from a data engineering perspective?\n* Should I focus on scaling up to **multi-node** (Kubernetes, Ray, etc.) or polishing what I have?\n* Any strategies for **multi-GPU optimization** and memory handling?\n* Worth refactoring for **stream-based (real-time) review ingestion**?\n* Are there common pitfalls I’m not seeing?\n\n**Potential Applications Beyond Gaming:**\n\n* App Store reviews\n* Amazon product sentiment\n* Customer feedback for SaaS tools\n\n🔗 **GitHub repo**: [https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens](https://github.com/Matrix030/SteamLens)\n\nI've uploaded the data I scrapped on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshgharat/steam-games-data-40-gb) if anyone want to use it\n\n  \nHappy to take any suggestions — would love to hear thoughts from folks who've built distributed ML or analytics systems at scale!\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

        "author": "santiviquez",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "\"Start right. Shift left.\"\n\nIs that just another marketing gimmick in data engineering?\n\nHere is my opinion after thinking about it for the last couple of weeks.\n\nI bet every data engineer who's ever been exposed to data quality has heard at least one of these two terms.\n\nThe first time I heard “shift left” and “shift right,” it felt like an empty concept.\n\nOf course, I come from AI/ML, where pretty much everything is a marketing gimmick until proven otherwise. 😂\n\nAnd “start right, shift left” can really feel like nonsense. Especially when it's said without a practical explanation, a set of tools to do it, or even a reason why it makes sense.\n\n  \nNow that I need to get better at data engineering, I’ve been thinking about this a lot. So...\n\n**Here is what I've come to understand about \"start right\" and \"shift left\".** (please correct if wrong).\n\n  \n**Start right**\n\nStart right is about detection. It means spotting your first data quality issues at the far right end of your data pipeline. Usually called downstream.\n\nBut not with traditional data quality tests. The idea is to do it in a scalable way. Something you can quickly set up across hundreds or thousands of tables and get results fast.\n\nBecause nobody wants to set up manual checks for every single table.\n\nIn practice, starting right means using data observability tools that rely on algorithms to pick up anomalies in your data quality metrics. It's about finding the unknowns.\n\nOnce that’s done, it’s way easier to prioritize which tables need a manual check. That’s where “shift left” comes in.\n\n  \n**Shift left**\n\nShift left is about prevention. It's about stopping the issues you found earlier from happening again.\n\nYou do that by moving to the left side of the pipeline (upstream) and setting up manual checks and data contracts.\n\nThis is where engineers and business folks agree on what the data should always look like. What values are valid? What data types should we support? What filters should be in place?\n\n  \n\\---\n\nBy starting right and shifting left, we take a realistic and practical approach to data quality. Sure, you can add some basic checks early on. But no matter what, there will always be things we miss, issues that only show up downstream.\n\nThankfully, ML isn’t just a gimmick. It can really help us notice what’s broken.",

Data volume is around 2GB a day, so nothing crazy.\n\nCurrently my pipeline, if you can call it that, is:\n\n1. Restore dumps/copy files into our Postgres database once every night. Runs with cron. \n\n2. Runs SQL transformations. Currently a single .sql file with 8000 lines. Runs on a simple bash script. Runs with cron, 1 hour after step 1.\n\n3. Power BI with gateway as reporting tool, connects to Postgres, refreshes... you guessed it, 1 hour after step 2.\n\nThat's it. HOWEVER, as you can evidently see:\n\n1. Running each step one hour after the previous one, while it works fine, isn't exactly reliable. It's not gonna help in the future.\n\n2. 8000 sql file. I did like this simply because of inertia and I thought it wouldn't be a big deal (LOL). If I change ONE thing I'm scared of breaking everything else. Adding stuff is also a mess. Referencing other code is a pain. You understand how problematic this is no need to explain.\n\n3. I want to make sure that new transformations are correct before pushing updates. Right now it's \"this code looks perfectly fine, copy and paste, replace!\". Then if I see something wrong in the database, I run to fix it before 11am the next day. Again, you already know how problematic this is. I want to be able to test and check that everything is correct in the database, then push to prod.\n\n4. Automate the process of \"replacing\" stuff. Right now I copy the .sql file, paste and replace, then run everything manually 🤡. I have looked into Git, and have been using it keep track of changes on this .sql file at least. No more \"funny_finance_sql_v1.sql\" and on!\n\nAs for me, I can handle my own with SQL, some databases, some Powershell/bash, some C# from my \"learn to code\" times, Excel, Power BI, etc. But no actual programming/data engineering studies or experience. I'm a finance guy but this work has been very interesting not gonna lie.\n\nAlso, my boss is more than willing to spend a few thousand if needed in tools or training, since the value with this silly pipeline has been pretty high in his eyes and now loves me 8).\n\nAny input appreciated.

Technically I'm an analytics engineer and really just work on establishing some pipelines. At first I didn't mind the job and enjoyed the problem solving but as time flew by, the less I cared to level up and get better. My coworkers are all much older than me but are beyond talented at what they do. The speed in which I complete stories and have it optimized is not nearly as good as them and while I do get the bare minimum accomplished, everyone else around me is overachieving.\n\nAnother reason why I don't think I'm cut out for this kind of job is my terrible memory and lack of attention to detail. My coworkers that are 1.5-1.8x my age are able to recall things that I come to them for help months ago where I can't even remember the context. I haven't been enjoying the late nights fixing pipelines and thinking about work on my vacations and time off. I'd like to switch to something else but the pay has been too good it's hard to break free of the golden handcuffs.\n\n/rant\n\nI guess I'm looking for advice on how to move forward and seeing what someone that used to be in a similar position as me has done.",

Better *security features*: lineage tracking, RBAC, and edge protections.\n\n*Second test (run by me):*\n- Recreated equivalent tables in Redshift for the same 6-month dataset.\n- *Findings*:\n  1. Redshift delivered *50% faster* performance on the same query.\n  2. *Zero ETL* in our pipeline — leading to significant cost savings.\n  3. We highlighted that *ad-hoc query costs* would likely rise in Databricks over time.\n\nMy POV:\nWith proper data modeling and ongoing maintenance, *Redshift offers better performance and cost efficiency*—especially in well-optimized enterprise environments.\n",

I'm working on a data engineering problem and would love to hear your thoughts on my solution and how you might approach it differently.\n\n**Problem**: I need to create a unique user ID (cb\\_id) that unifies user identifiers from multiple mock sources (SourceA, SourceB, SourceC). Each user can have multiple IDs from each source (e.g., one SourceA ID can map to multiple SourceB IDs, and vice versa). I have mapping dictionaries like {SourceA\\_id: \\[SourceB\\_id1, SourceB\\_id2, ...\\]} and {SourceA\\_id: \\[SourceC\\_id1, SourceC\\_id2, ...\\]}, with SourceA as the central link. Some IDs (e.g., SourceB) may appear first, with SourceA IDs joining later (e.g., after a day). The dataset is large (5-20 million records daily), and I require incremental updates and the ability to add new sources later. The output should be a dictionary, such as {cb\\_id: {\"sourceA\\_ids\": \\[\\], \"sourceB\\_ids\": \\[\\], \"sourceC\\_ids\": \\[\\]}}.\n\n**My Solution**: I'm using Spark with GraphX in Scala to model IDs as graph vertices and mappings as edges. I find connected components to group all IDs belonging to one user, then generate a cb\\_id (hash of sorted IDs for uniqueness). Results are stored in Delta Lake for incremental updates via MERGE, allowing new IDs to be added to existing cb\\_ids without recomputing the entire graph. The setup supports new sources by adding new mapping DataFrames and extending the output schema.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n* Is this a solid approach for unifying user IDs across sources with these constraints?\n* How would you tackle this problem differently (e.g., other tools, algorithms, or storage)?\n* Any pitfalls or optimizations I might be missing with GraphX or Delta Lake for this scale?\n\nThanks for any insights or alternative ideas!\n\n",

It's designed to solve a few key problems:\n\n* Useful queries get written once, then lost forever in DMs or personal notes.\n* Constantly re-configuring database connections for different AI tools is a pain.\n* Most multi-database solutions are cloud-based, meaning your schema or data goes to a third party (no thanks).\n\nHere’s what it does:\n\n* Unifies all your databases with a one-step setup. Connect to PostgreSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc., and configure clients like Cursor and Copilot in a single step.\n* It runs locally on your machine, never exposes credentials, and enforces read-only operations by design.\n* Teaches the AI with your team's proven query patterns. Instead of just seeing a raw schema, the AI learns from successful, historical queries to understand your data's context and relationships.\n\nWe're in **open beta** and looking for people to try it out, break it, and tell us what's missing. All features are completely free while we gather feedback.\n\nIt's open-source, and you can find instructions to run it with Docker or install it via pip/uv on the GitHub page.\n\nIf you're dealing with similar workflow pains, I'd love to get your thoughts!\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm building an e-commerce website for my girlfriend, who runs a small natural candles shop, to help her improve sales, but I also want to make it useful for my DE portfolio.\n\nI’m currently working as a Murex consultant, mostly fixing errors and developing minor scripts in Python for financial reports, tweaking PL/SQL queries, and building some DAGs in Airflow. Of course, I also work with the Murex platform itself. While this is good experience, my long-term goal is to become a data engineer, so I’m teaching myself and trying to build relevant projects.\n\nSince a web app is not directly aligned with a data engineering path, I’ve thought carefully about the tech stack and some additions that would make it valuable for my portfolio.\n\n**Stack**\n\n**Backend:**\n\n* Python (FastAPI), my main language and one I want to get more confident in.\n* SQLAlchemy for ORM\n* PostgreSQL as the main relational database\n\n**Frontend** *(less relevant for my career, but important for the shop)*:\n\n* HTML + Jinja2 (or possibly Alpine.js for lightweight interactivity)\n\n**DE-related components:**\n\n* Airflow to orchestrate daily/monthly data pipelines (sales, traffic, user behavior)\n* A data lake for ingestion, to later use in dashboards or reports\n* Docker containers to manage Airflow and possibly other parts of the project’s infrastructure\n* Optional CI/CD to automate checks and deployment\n\n# My main questions are:\n\n1. Do you think it makes sense to merge DE with a web-based project like this?\n2. Any advice on how I can make this more relevant to DE roles?\n3. What features or implementations would you personally consider interesting in a DE portfolio?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n**TL;DR**: I'm building an e-commerce site (FastAPI, PostgreSQL) with integrated DE components (Airflow, Docker, data lake, optional CI/CD). Although the project is web-based, I'm aiming to make it relevant to a data engineering portfolio. Looking for feedback and suggestions on how to get the most value out of it as a DE project.",

        "author": "eMperror_",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi,\n\nOur main OLTP database is an RDS Aurora Postgres database and it's working well but we need to perform some analytics queries that we currently do on a read replica but some of those queries are quite slow and we want to offload all of this to an OLAP or OLAP-like database. Most of our data is similar to a time-series so we thought of going with another Postgres instance but with Timescale installed to create aggregate functions. We mainly need to keep sums / averages / of historical data and timescale seems like a good fit for this.\n\nThe problem I have is how can I keep RDS -> Postgres in sync? Our use-case cannot really have batched data because our services need this analytics data to perform domain decisions (has a user reached his daily transactions limit for example) and we also want to offload all of our grafana dashboards from the main database to Timescale.\n\nWhat do people usually use for this? Debezium? Logical Replication? Any other tool?\n\nWe would really like to keep using RDS as a source of truth but offload all analytics to another DB that is more suited for this, if possible.\n\nIf so, how do you deal with an evolving DDL schema over time, do you just apply your DB migrations to both DBs and call it a day? Do you keep a completely different schema for the second database?\n\nOur Timescale instance would be hosted in K8s through the CNPG operator.\n\nI want to add that we are not 100% set on Timescale and would be open to other suggestions. We also looked at Starrocks, a CNCF project, which looks promising but a bit complex to get up and running.",

I also have a new appreciation for pointers. In fact, I’ve thought of C as a ‘low level’ language, but this makes you realize how much that language is doing for you under the hood.\n\nBasically: you start with a simple NAND logic gate and build your way up to making a functioning (Turing complete) computer. The content is all free, but you have to pay for the autograder + certificate, which is totally not necessary. \n\nI don’t know that I’d recommend this as an intro course for someone who’s never programmed, though you don’t technically need any programming knowledge. And I don’t know that I’d really recommend it if your number one goal is just to get a job. But if you actually want to improve as a programming, having a general understanding of these underlying systems will really really help.\n\nI don’t have any association with the course or anything, like I said, I think it’s probably a decade old (or more) at this point.

        "content": "I understand that documentation pretty much has everything you could ever want to know about a certain technology, but I personally HATE learning through documentation.\n\nI never understood the advice of, \"just read the documentation\",  SPECIFICALLY towards beginners. Never worked for me. I feel like I've learned better and more effectively through having a MAIN course for something I want to learn and documentation as a SIDE-RESOURCE that I use to refresh my memory or learn new concepts quickly for a technology I'm already comfortable with. I want to learn the bigger picture, not just learn the modules in Node, and I feel like courses are great at explaining WHY something works and in what situations it is best in. I believe this is why I've enjoyed The Odin Project so much even though they heavily push on reading documentation. They don't just send you the link to JavaScript.info and tell you to read the whole thing, they give you little bits and pieces from the website and other websites for you to learn that specific concept and in their article they teach you the bigger picture of why you're even learning said concept and why the resources they're linking are good resources.\n\nNow, this is not to say that MDN, JavaScript.info, W3Schools and other websites are bad resources. I just feel like if my friend tells me tomorrow, \"Hey I want to learn HTML\". I wouldn't just tell them to download VSCode and read W3Schools. I'd give them different options like freeCodeCamp, programming with mosh's video, udemy courses, etc, and then they can read MDN to refresh their memory or revise new concepts. Or I'd ask them what their preferred method of learning is and we go from there.\n\nAt the end of the day, not everyone is going to feel comfortable learning the same way. Which is why we should keep that in mind and not tell the beginner, \"just dive in and read MDN when you get lost\". I feel like a lot of documentation out there isn't very beginner friendly, or doesn't go slow enough for that person to grasp the why's and how's of that technology.",

        "author": "yughiro_destroyer",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hello!  \nWhen I started to learn programming a few years ago, I was introduced to OOP and I thought \"Woah, that's the best way to reason about data in programming!\". Over my experience as a programmer, I saw OOP to be highly encouraged in academy and to some degree even to my workplace.  \nAs I programmed more and more I started to hit tons of roadblocks that kept me from truly finishing my projects (mostly related to game development). It wasn't until I tried data oriented paradigms, such as an entity component system (ECS) that I saw better progress.  \nWith OOP, you have to plan very carefully how you plan your inheritance chain. You might initially make Player and Enemy inherit from Character but then decide that Player and Enemy share many things that you eventually make Player inherit from Enemy too. Then you also realize that Enemy should have a behavior you don't want Player to have. No matter what you do, you either load unused behaviors into the object or you are forced to rewrite the same code for two classes.  \nYour object can't be two things at one. Let's say you have fighters, archers and mages in your game - three classes. At some point, you want the player to be both an archer and a mage. How do you do that without complex or ugly workarounds like creating another class named FighterAndMage ? Or FigherAndMageAndArcher. Code gets ugly real fast.  \nEncapsulation is a useful trait for OOP to make code more secure but getts and setters can add a lot of boilerplate.  \nWith ECS you have a relation of \"IT HAS\" instead of \"IT IS\". An \"object\" is a collection of components (position, volume...) and a system is a function that operates on objects that have certain components. With this, adding new behaviors becomes easy plug and play, as adding or removing logic doesn't break the entire program.  \nIf I were to compare this to a real life application, OOP is like building a computer in one single circuit board - something breaks, the whole computer breaks. With ECS (or DOD similar paradigms) it's like building a computer from multile parts - if an SSD fails the rest of the computer keeps working. And refactoring or modifying an OOP class is very risky, especially if that happens to a parent class, beacuse there's no way how the children will react to those changes.  \nOOP through composition is an alternative to inheritance and cleaner in my view but there's still some issues a pure DOD paradigm doesn't have. For instance, a composed class Button that is made of class Position and class Volume needs the method \"pressed()\" which in fact will act on those two inner classes. But if you change the Volume and Position, it could break again, and what if you wanted to share \"pressed()\" to another class like \"CheckBox\" ? Will you inherit from \"Button\"? It's possible but that causes lots of chains to follow that at some point becomes exhausting to keep track of. With an ECS paradigm for example the entities are self explanatory - it has that component then it's subjected to this action.  \nI find OOP has use for creating data models or classes with unique behaviors no other class has. Or use composition to build bigger classes from smaller classes.  \nHow do you view this?",

        "content": "Hi guys,\n\nFirst of all I am a senior software engineer. I have been in the field for the last five years, I did almost everything. Native Android development for one year before working then I developed some freelancing apps, then I used my android skills to crack some applications on freelancer. Then I moved for full stack development for the best 3 years. I can do different frameworks, I can create beautiful production ready websites using React,...etc.\n\nThe issue is, I still cannot fit myself in any stack. I tried in my free time game development I was stuck because I failed to learn shaders  (I couldn't build a connection with the logic)  \nAlso, I am so bad at designing 3d or 2D. I tried low level coding and contribute to open source projects I got bored fast,...etc. Also, I tried AI for some time got bored fast\n\nI don't know what to do. Whatever field I join I get bored or I be like man that's not my place. The best thing I can do is full stack development but it's boring some random CRUD operations and doing the same security measures over and over.\n\nI hope to get answers from really old dudes in the field.\n\nOne last thing I forgot to mention: I’m currently a full-time software engineer, but I’m not specifically doing full-stack work. Instead, I’m assigned random tasks across many parts of the company’s systems, mostly to avoid getting stuck doing just one thing.\n\nAn Edit, Should I start game development for fun (again), and Will I be able to do something in game engines. I feel like that part can be okay for me",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "In high school (grades 9–11), I was the best student in my class at math. I really liked it and wanted to study higher mathematics.\n\nNow I’m studying Computer Science at university and aiming to become a software developer. My question is about the actual level of higher mathematics knowledge required for a programmer.\n\nOf course, math is essential, but the specific areas you need depend on your field. For example, machine learning and systems programming require deep knowledge of probability theory, statistics, linear algebra, mathematical analysis, and discrete math.\n\nTo create new algorithms or be an advanced developer, you definitely need higher math.\n\nHowever, here’s my problem:  \n\nI struggle to memorize all the theory presented in lectures. I don’t remember all the integration or differentiation methods. When I face a mathematical problem, I usually can't solve it right away. I have to look up the method or algorithm, study some examples, and only then can I solve it — which takes time.\n\nSo I’d like to ask developers who regularly deal with advanced mathematics:  \n\nWhen you're faced with a math-heavy problem, do you immediately know which method to use and remember the formulas by heart? Or do you also have to look things up and review examples?\n\nAlso, will I fail an interview for a systems programmer or ML developer if I don’t know all the higher math theory by heart? What if I can't solve a math problem on the spot?\n\nLastly, I’m worried that in real work I’ll spend too much time solving math problems, which might not be acceptable for employers. ",

I really want to make good use of this time and start learning Web Development seriously.\n\nI’ve heard about The Odin Project and CodeWithHarry’s web dev playlist on YouTube. Both seem good, but I’m wondering if there’s something better out there—something that’s:\n\nEasy to understand\n\nBeginner-friendly\n\nHas great explanations\n\nPossibly less time-consuming (but still solid in terms of learning)\n\n\nI’d really appreciate suggestions from people who’ve been down this road. What would you recommend for someone just getting started but willing to stay committed during the summer?\n\nThanks in advance! 🙌",

That’s part of what’s making this decision tough.\n\nOn one hand: •\tIt’s paid •\tI’d get solid work experience and build professional soft skills •\tI wouldn’t be left with an empty term\n\nBut on the other hand: •\tIt’s not aligned with the software/dev path I want to pursue •\tI’m worried it won’t be the most relevant or impactful experience in the long run •\tI don’t want it to push me into an IT support career trajectory by default\n\nI’m also nervous about declining and not finding anything else. I’ve applied to a lot of places already, but nothing else has worked out yet, this one came unexpectedly.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar spot?

I do not care; I just want a smooth implementation of my ideas.\n\nI am currently using a Linux VM on my windows pc to learn. I like the simplicity of it, the separation from my main files(in some manner) and all the bash stuff. I have two monitors. One I dedicate to the tutorials(windows side, because the VM runs videos and other things slowly) and the other I dedicate to all my practice and coding and all that. This has worked well for me so far, but I would like to know if this will cause me issues in the future.\n\nAll my writing files for this project are in google docs or libreoffice, the former because I tend to write on a laptop away from home and need a way to keep it synced. Most of my non-coding development for this project happens on windows, as well as other things like browsing or playing games. \n\nMy question is this: should I plan to scoot over to Linux permanently at some point? Should I dual boot? Should I plan to transfer my knowledge to Windows after this course is finished(Odin project, of course)? Should I dual boot? \n\nIf the answer to these are “personal preference” I am completely okay with that. I am just seeking guidance, know the pros and cons for my situation, and I do not need Linux for the purpose of being marketable for companies(which is what people mention whenever this question comes up online, for good reason.)",

In the program, it seems that it can't read it, or something, because everything except for case, the text and break don't have their colours. And when I put the cursor there, it says that I need to put a String or a println with String, but in the class I'm following it's nothing like that. And, when I tried rewritting, it didn't work.\n\n\nI tried making a new Class and wrote Sysout... without anything and it works, but when I write it pasting the Switch I made (outside or inside the Switch cases), the others won't change and the one I did prior to paste it, have their colours. It's super strange. A friend told me that it was probably a problem with the syntax of my lines, but I write Sysout using Ctrl+Space (to save time), so, it can't be a syntax problem.\n\n\nI'll try to write everything in advance so I can continue the class, but I want to know the real solution to this strange error, if it exists...\n\n                \n\n",

I already spent my saving and I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do, for the past couple of months I studied a lot of things (video editing, digital marketing, excel) but I'm unsure if I want to go that route. Ever since, I always been interested in tech but was not able to pursue it so right now I would like to give it a try, I been studying HTML for a bit now (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/).\n\nI dont know yet if I will be doing backend or frontend still undecided on that yet, and I don't know what kind of roadmap I should follow. So if there's any tips or advice you can give me. please do.\n\n  \nI'm also looking for mentorship if you guys know any, im willing to give my 1st pay once I landed a job or maybe help you out with other things..\n\nthankyou\n\nPS.

However, I made a similar weather api project 2 years ago when I first started learning to code with SheCodes- a beginners course. Over the past two years I’ve done further Python courses, and a software engineering bootcamp with CodeFirstGirls where we went over JavaScript, Python and MySQL.  Right now I’m a web designer for a law company - we can both use html bootstrap css, so nothing technical. I do enjoy front end so these qualities aren’t pointless to write on my cv, but I’ve been here for 13 months but I’m not challenge enough.  I feel like I’ve gone backwards. Even this weather app seemed a bit difficult. The reason I say self sabotage is because I went back to JavaScript, something I began learning years ago. I felt like I didn’t know it enough so I went right back to the beginning rather than going onto react which I now feel like I should have. I never know how much JavaScript I should know before I move on. \n\nAlso another thing that gets to me, is during my bootcamp, the instructors encouraged us to use ChatGPT. They said in their jobs they use it everyday and the skill is know what it ask and where to add this in your code, so some times I use ChatGPT but maybe more than I should. \n\nIs this normal? \n\nI’m also 26 in 5 months, and I’m on 31k right now.

I am not necessarily a stranger to graphics, as I worked alongside the LearnOpenGL book and finished most of it up to the section on PBR.  However, I am not sure if my approach to that book was the best and it ended up taking me a really long time to internalize the concepts, and even at that, now I wouldn't even know simple things like more advanced yet standard lighting techniques.  \n\nTo prevent wasting a lot of time and actually learn better, I was wondering what is the best way to read a programming/CS book/textbook?  I am at the moment reading the Raytracing in a weekend series (going to read all 3 books), and then I would like to read the PBRT book.  I noticed that there is a lot of given code and concepts in raytracing in a weekend, as well as PBRT, and I am wondering if I should just read it, or if I should be programming alongside it.  Or maybe I should read it first and then try to apply it? but then by then I have forgotten everything.\n\nI dont know but any help I very much appreciate.

How did you manage it?\n\nWhat helped you stay focused while learning and job hunting at the same time?\n\nShould I try freelancing, internships, or open-source to fill my resume?\n\nIs it okay to take a bit longer to become job-ready as long as I stay consistent?\n\n\nI’d love to hear advice from anyone who’s gone through a non-linear path or has any encouragement to share.

        "content": "Hello, I recently finished the Odin Project's NodeJS full stack course, but I'm worried I don't fully understand how to protect against cross-site scripting attacks. If I'm taking in html form input though the express.urlencoded middleware, what do I need to watch out for? \n\nI know I should validate the input format with something like the express-validator middleware, but what about for something like a text-area where a user might have a perfectly valid reason for including \"dangerous characters\"? \n\nI've tried escaping/encoding the input, but at least with the express-validator `.escape()` method, this literally displays the output as encoded symbols. I've discovered that if I don't use `.escape()` and just display the content in the view either with the `.textContent` DOM method or with a templating engine like ejs, it will display the proper text content on the page and literally display any `<script>` or other html tags instead of running the code inside of them. However, is there still a risk of an attacker manipulating the code on the back-end if I don't escape the input?\n\nFinally, I know I should use parameterization for Postgresql queries. Will this alone protect my database from SQL injection (I'm use node-postgres for queries)?\n\nThank you for your responses and assistance.",

        "author": "Accomplished_Escape4",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "It's the summer after HS graduation, right before I enter my first semester of University in my Data Science major. I thought, \"Maybe I should learn code before anything else, get ahead, and make some time for math when I'm actually in uni. My 11th-grade Pre-cal teacher recommended learning code first even.\" There weren't many free online structured courses for learning Python that had hands-on practice but I did find Kaggle.\n\n  \nI completed the short \"Intro to Programming\" course on there with relative ease. Some exercises were mildly tricky but I was able to get through them with minimal hints and criticism from ChatGPT. After that, I headed onto the main Python course. This was also relatively easy in the first few topics but when it got to lists, list comprehension, dictionaries, for loops and stuff, the exercises became increasingly difficult. The reading part before the exercises page weren't the hardest to understand and I even tried my best to truly understand the content. I would try a code first, see if it's correct, if it isn't, I send it to ChatGPT to see what's wrong with it without providing a hint to the solution, and try again. I'd even uncomment the \"q.solution()\" to see the solution when I'd given up after hours of head banging, trying to figure this out. I'd check out the solution, read through it line by line to see what the hell it's even doing and how it makes sense, not get it, send it to ChatGPT to explain it in practice, still get confused, explain bit by bit, go back, solve the same problem, move on to the next problem, and struggle with even getting *started*. I've been *especially* stuck on the \"Exercise: Strings and Dictionaries\" on problems 2 and 3. holy hell\n\n  \nI can not even think of what to start with, I can not brainstorm. I've heard the advice \"just code dumb stuff that pertains to the problem, fix it, expand it, and slowly work towards the solution\" but I feel like I can't even code dumb stuff either.\n\n  \nI thought maybe Kaggle goes to quick with questions that go from simple syntaxes, to abstractions of those syntaxes, and then abstractions UPON abstractions on those syntaxes that just overload my working memory. \n\n  \n**Is Kaggle actually the problem? Or am I approaching this terribly wrong?**",

My ultimate goal is to get into the AI/ML field, and I’ll have 3 years during MCA to build my skills.\n\nI’ve been researching roadmaps, and most of them recommend Python and strong math foundations—which actually works well for me since I studied a lot of math in depth during my BSc. So I started learning Python and brushing up on math side by side.\n\nI also spoke to my cousin who works at Boeing as a full-stack developer. He told me that full-stack/frontend/backend roles are getting saturated, and if I'm starting fresh, AI/ML is a better long-term direction. That motivated me even more to stick to this field.\n\nHowever, a friend of mine told me that companies don't just want Python developers. He said that languages like C++ and Java are often preferred too, and since Python is more \"readymade,\" it might not be enough alone. He suggested learning C++ or Java first, then Python later—which has left me confused.\n\nNow I’m also wondering—should I be open to development roles too? Like learning full-stack or backend frameworks (Django, React, etc.) along with Python and AI/ML stuff? Or should I just stay focused on AI/ML and not try to juggle too many things at once?\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation—coming from a non-CS background and aiming for AI/ML? I'd really appreciate any guidance, suggestions, or roadmaps.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I think for the startup I’ve been working on, there’s definitely been moments where I feel like we’re going really fast but eventually end up in a point where we need to think of real engineering solutions (particularly in case of software startup) and get stuck. It’s good for the early stages when you need to validate an idea or get something out there but you do eventually hit a wall and need to actually start thinking rather than relying on AI.\n\nVibe coding doesn’t create solutions that scale and exponentially increases technical debt if you’re putting no thought into what’s being engineered.

        "content": "95% of this subreddit is people complaining about the job market or AI.  The remaining 5% of actual advice is straight up garbage and completely outdated.  Thought I would help out by making a list of things that will greatly improve your job search\n\nAs a background, I have 6 years of Software Engineering experience and have worked with people of many backgrounds.  I have never worked at FAANG, went to a mediocre school with mediocre grades, never had an internships or anything like that.  But I have also never been unemployed.  This isn't for the .1% of people, this is for the common CS man (or woman).  And if you were asking, I'm a U.S. citizen in the U.S. market.  If you are neither of those this probably won't apply to you.\n\nWith that out of the way here's what I have gathered from my experience:\n\n**1. Apply to local/hybrid jobs in non-tech hubs.**  \nYour goal is to reduce competition as much as possible.  When I first started I would literally filter jobs on linkedIn to states nobody wanted to live in, like Ohio.  You will be given jobs in locations that people don't even know exist.  A lot of them have barely any applicants.  If they are desperate enough they will hire you.  Another tip would be to update your resume to have your location be within the same area, since companies might filter you if you are located too far away\n\n**2. Make sure your resume is concise.**  \nWhen I review resumes I hate ones that have tons of wordy bullet points that basically say nothing.  Don't dilute your resume with crap.  Most people have 1-2 important projects they have worked on at a company and a bunch of filler work.  Just focus on the important stuff and make sure it is clear what you actually did.  Also PLEASE do not use arbitrary percentages in your bullet points.  I hate this advice so much just put what you actually worked on.  It doesn't matter how the business benefitted we all know that is the point of work.\n\n**3. Similar to 2, make sure your technical skills are concise**  \nIf you put every tool or technology it looks like you have very little experience in lots of things.  Focus on putting skills that are needed for the job you are applying to.  Another easy approach is to take the skills you are best at (say React), and filter only for jobs with React.  Then do the same thing with Angular etc.\n\n**4. If you don't have any experience (or limited) YOU NEED TO DO PROJECTS**  \nYou need some way to show that you have some sort of technical knowledge or drive.  You don't need a github, but you should have projects that you can explain how they work.  This is especially crucial for internships.  My company just hired an intern that was the CEO/Cofounder of a startup.  Her startup? Building websites with other students for various people.  Sounds stupid, but it got her an internship.\n\n**5. Just straight up fucking lie**  \nI don't want to endorse this, but I just want people to know who they are competing with when they send out 500 applications without a response.  We hired someone who had experience as a software engineer.  But they accidentally told me they were a QA at their last role.  I checked their linked in and they were listed as a software engineer.  So yeah, if you work in tech support, QA, product.  Doesn't matter, you were a software engineer\n\n**6.  Same as number 5**  \nThis is more reasonable in my opinion because recruiters are stupid.  If you have React experience and applying to a job with Angular, congrats - you actually have Angular experience.  Same with Java and C# etc.  The important thing is you are able to actually pass an interview for this stuff.  It is worth it to review core concepts and maybe do a few leetcode problems in that language.  At the end of the day you need a job\n\n**7. Interview advice: be honest but not too honest**  \nWhen I was interviewing for a job I wanted they asked me a common interview question about a time I failed.  So I told them a real story about how I messed up getting requirements and caused a delay in the release.  I didn't get this job.  The next job I applied to asked the same question, so I told the same story but rephrased it where product threw a bunch of requirements at me last minute and I had to work overtime to get things across the finish line.  I did get this job.  You get the idea\n\n**8. Do not negotiate**  \nThere's a lot of people on this sub that will scold you for not negotiating.  But I have seen first hand peoples' offers get rescinded for negotiating, especially in this market.  Just accept the damn offer once you get to this stage.  Every job I've gotten when I negotiate I got $5k more on top of the initial offer which is not worth risking losing an offer over.  I simply asked if there was any wiggle room and they gave me basically the same offer\n\n**9: For students: do not waste your time**  \nSeriously, start applying/working on projects as early as you can.  Grades hardly matter.  I knew a dumb kid that had a 4.0.  It didn't make a difference when it came to getting a job.  He could have spent some of his time studying instead building a react app or something and gotten a 3.7 and been better off.  Take as many easy classes as possible and focus on learning on your own time.  Most CS classes I've taken taught be .01% of my current CS knowledge\n\n**10: Make sure everything is up to date, even when employed**  \nKeep your resume up to date with your latest experience.  Try to check LinkedIn/Indeed once a week or so.  I've seens job boards get flooded with really good jobs one week, which all get removed the next.  You never know when that next opportunity is going to be available so it's good to always be looking.",

        "content": "This might be an unpopular take, but lately I’ve found myself reaching for AI coding tools less, not more. A year ago, I was all in. Copilot in my editor, ChatGPT open in one tab, pasting console errors like it was a team member. But now? I’m kinda over it.\n\nSomewhere between the half-correct suggestions, the weird variable names, and the constant second-guessing, I realized I was spending more time editing than coding. Not in a purist way, just… practically speaking. I’d ask for a function and end up rewriting 70% of what it gave me, or worse, chasing down subtle bugs it introduced.\n\nThere was a week I used it heavily while prototyping a new internal service. At first it felt fast code was flying. But reviewing it later, everything was just slightly off. Not wrong, just shallow. Error handling missing. Naming inconsistent. I had to redo most of it to meet the bar I’d expect from a human.\n\nI still think there’s a place for these tools. I’ve seen them shine in repetitive stuff, test cases, boilerplate, converting between formats. And when I’m stuck at 10 PM on a weird TypeScript issue, I’ll absolutely throw a hail mary into GPT. But it’s become more like a teammate you work with occasionally, not one you rely on every day.\n\nJust wondering if there are other folks feeling this too? Like the honeymoon phase is over, and now we’re trying to figure out where AI actually fits into the real-world workflow?\n\nNot trying to dunk on the tools. I just keep seeing blog posts about “future of coding” and wondering if we’re seeing a revolution or just a really loud beta.",

        "content": "Hey Guys,\n\nI finally got my first job offer since applying for the last 4 months, and the culture, people, and pay is great for my first job out of college. The only thing is that the majority of my job will be using COBOL/JCL and the more I learn about the language the less I like. I'm also not wanting to get trapped in a hole where the only jobs I'm qualified for are legacy systems or ones using COBOL. Tbf they said that they were trying to migrate off of it, but it will most likely take a long time before that can happen.\n\nI'm having trouble figuring out if I should keep applying to other jobs while I work this one or not look a gift horse in the mouth. I would feel guilty about leaving say a month after they finally train me as I told them that I had no prior COBOL experience and are willing to train me. Can anyone else give me advice about whether this experience will carry over to a new job or if I should just keep applying and leave whenever I get a new offer.\n\n  \nUpdate: I took the job! Thanks so much for the replies, It's helped me see the job in a new light. A lot of you guys had some good points, especially about keeping a COBOL consulting job in my back pocket in case I need to fall back on it. Luckily I like the company and I'm really grateful that they gave me a shot even though my experience isn't in COBOL. I'm excited to start with them and like other people were saying, maybe I can get my hands in modernizing or working on some of their other projects while I'm there. \n\nAlso to the people who saw this and were like duhh take it, I have some things that would make me very marketable to the field I'm interested in and got myself a couple of interviews for those companies, but there just aren't jobs for it in my state and I was weighing whether I can stay here and gain experience while being close to my family and do that in a couple years, or I should just leave now and try for that even if I have to move a little farther than I would like.

What I mean by this is : A hobby project is exactly that  a small, self contained app with limited scope. You’re not trying to build an enterprise-grade solution, nor are you expected to. And unless you’ve already worked in the industry, you likely have no idea what enterprise development even *looks* like.\n\nOne Google search will throw you into a rabbit hole of 20 unfamiliar technical keywords, and suddenly you’re trying to engineer a business-scale architecture for a portfolio project. It’s not realistic and it creates a false impression of what actual preparation looks like.\"",

But over time, I started getting feedback that I was too slow. Eventually, I was put on PIP (and failed). It was tough pill to swallow since I had always assumed that as long as I delivered work, that would be enough. Apparently, speed matters as well.\n\nPost that chapter, I joined a startup. But, few months in here, I'm getting the same feedback. Management is again raising concerns about my speed and deliverables.\n\nIt's a bit frustrating, since I do put in the hours. A typical day is like 7-8 hours, with 3-4 hours of focused work. But, when things get heated to meet deadlines, I find myself pushing the hours to 13+ hour days for stretches, to keep up.\n\nI'll admit I'm introvert by nature. I don't engage a lot in casual conversations, but I try to communicate clearly about anything related to my work. I document my designs, processes, task breakdowns etc - Anything that might clear things for the management, or, might help others for future reference.\n\nAnd, still I find myself tagged as a \"slow developer\". It's very hard and honestly, I'm not sure how to improve from here. This breaks down my workplace confidence completely.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation, how did you overcome it? What would you suggest to improve if you were in my shoes? And, are there alternative career paths I can explore?\n\nEdit - Since some people asked about situation based examples:\n\n\\- I was assigned a deliverable, which took me about 9 months (as single developer on the project). About 4 months went into testing, which wasn't even on me since the testing process was completely ad-hoc. Looking back, I could have communicated a bit better, but it would still take me about \\~3 months for that project.\n\n\\- In my current startup, since the last 5 months, I'm working on a totally different aspect than what my team's functional domain is. This required me to understand a ton of things to enable myself to start delivering. Also, since there is shortage of documentations, I mostly had to rely on people & codebases to get the understandings. This took me significant time, and was labelled as slow.

My journet could be entirely luck tbh, I'm extremely surprised I got something so quick. The wife and I budgeted 3 months of my planned unemployment after resigning. Happy to answer any questions. I didn't even know what an ATS resume checker was until I saw this subreddit. And yes I used AI to clean up my post lol. ",

How can you plan to make major life decisions like starting a family knowing you can lose your job at any time and potentially be unemployed for months. Many people are rightfully angry about it but blaming the wrong causes. \n\nIt’s true that offshoring is caused by far lower salaries in other countries but we don’t look any deeper than that. We assume it’s a good thing because the US is a “rich” country and assume everyone else is extremely poor and desperate. We ignore that we have a huge cost of living crisis primarily driven by our insane housing costs no where higher than in Silicon Valley. \n\nThe primary cause of our high housing costs are nationwide restrictive zoning laws that prevent the supply of housing from meeting the demand and making it extremely difficult and expensive to build anything. r/yimby has great discourse on this issue if you want to learn more. \n\nIt’s impossible for Americans to compete because we would literally be homeless if we were paid equivalent salaries in the countries they are offshoring. I also worry that it is fueling \nracist backlash against certain groups. \n",

        "content": "I applied to Apple about a month ago for an LLVM GPU Compiler Engineer position. For context, I currently work at Intel as an LLVM Compiler Engineer (3yrs here, 7yrs total experience), working almost exclusively on the optimizing middle-end. Plenty of CPU experience, but not much GPU experience, which I was upfront about and they were totally fine with throughout the process.\n\nOver the course of 4 weeks or so, I went through a pretty grueling hiring process (1 manager screen, 1 technical screen, 4 technical interviews + 1 behavioral interview) that mostly seemed to go well. Hiring manager seemed impressed by my personal projects and professional experience, and the interviewers all seemed like smart and capable people. At this time, I'm also in a process with Qualcomm for a CPU LLVM Engineer position and they also seem very interested (though I'm a bit skeptical of them, tbh the team seemed very demoralized and overworked). At this point, Apple said they want to move forward and we're in the offer phase.\n\nI just had a conversation with the recruiter this morning just checking the team was something I was interested in and starting the conversation about salary expectations. I told him I like the team and I'm very interested in what Apple has to offer. However, when I told him I'm expecting something in the base pay range of $200k - $250k he seemed very shocked. He used the phrase \"strongly misaligned\" on salary expectations. I told him the truth: I'm currently making close to the middle of that range at Intel, plus stock and bonuses (about another $20-40k). I panicked a little when I heard that, so I backpedaled a bit and told him that compensation wasn't necessarily the most important factor and hopefully it wouldn't be an impediment to them making an offer. He said he'll need to talk to the senior hiring manager and get back to me.\n\nI have another call scheduled with him tomorrow to talk again, but I'm worried I screwed up. The online posting says the base pay range is between $175,800 and $312,200, so I don't think I highballed them or made a ridiculous offer. I understand experience may be a mitigating factor, but I'm still really worried. Intel has been doing really poorly since I started working here, and while I like the work overall and have a good relation with my manager, working with my team can be pretty exhausting, and the layoffs have taken a heavy toll. All in all, I'm ready to get out.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks if you've read this far.",

        "content": "I have been a software engineer for 13 years now. I've been web frontend focused since 2019 since I took a liking to it at the end of my first job. Anyway, my career has had its ups and downs, but it feels way way down right now.\n\nMy career was going pretty well until I got laid off in March, 2023. Since then I have had two jobs, and both ended poorly. I am currently unemployed yet again, but unlike previous job searches, I am not feeling hopeful this time.\n\nOne of my last two jobs ended with being fired and my previous one ended with resignation. Both lasted less than 1 year. I felt productive at both jobs, and I made an effort to help less experienced devs. However, after a while, I would inevitably clash with leadership and not behave that well, and the reasons were different at the two companies.\n\nAt one, I felt overly constrained by controlling product managers and wasn't able to make any code change that was not ticketed, since every single PR needed manual QA before being merged into prod. I felt that the React code was the worst I'd ever seen, such as ~25 components that were 1000+ lines long. One component had an ENORMOUS switch statement for conditional rendering that I badly wanted to refactor, but it wasn't a business priority. I also wanted to introduce tests since there weren't any at all, but it wasn't a business priority. Anyway, after trying to take initiative on these things and being blocked, I handled things without much tact, empathy, or whatever else is necessary to maintain good relations with people. Eventually I was fired.\n\nThe most recent job I thought was going to be better. It took me 7.5 months to get it and I liked the industry it was in and the novelty of the service they offered. The code was better than at the other company, and there was more room to make code changes I felt were important to make (after making a Jira ticket myself first). About midway through I got to greenfield a frontend for an internal software overhaul, and it was pretty cool honestly. But then the head of engineering was fired and never replaced, and another engineer that I got to know somewhat was fired without backfill. At one point I was split between a new modern website the company was building and the greenfield internal project, which signaled that I was valuable, but I also couldn't handle it. We had only two frontend devs, myself and a more junior person, working on two huge projects, both rewrites meant to modernize software that had been tried and true for 15+ years.\n\nI was in a good position on the one hand, but on the other I just got burned out. Both projects had unrealistic deadlines given our dev resources. Engineering leadership felt non-existent since the fired head was never replaced. I couldn't balance the responsibilities with the rest of my life, which includes daughters aged 1 and 3.\n\nThen, since I was so frustrated by what was happening, I told the Owner/Founder of the company, who also wrote most of the original code, that we weren't going to hit the deadline, plus some other thoughts. He actually was open to what I was saying and he ended up convening a 2 hour meeting where we changed course with the internal project, and he thanked me for speaking up. I should have felt good about this, but everyone else on the project looked upset with me. At some point, it became clear to me they didn't approve of what I did for some reason, and they wouldn't tell me why, or in some cases talk to me at all. This became an unbearable situation for me and I ended up resigning.\n\nThroughout these two experiences, I had a lot of negative thoughts and kind of vented at people more than is helpful. Looking back, my intentions and my technical performance seem fine, but I just went about it all in a disruptive and heavy-handed way. I wanted to bring about change, but I didn't want to be patient in the process, and I assumed ill intent by others when it probably could have been explained by incompetence, ignorance, or simply an unfortunate set of circumstances.\n\nNow I'm in this all too familiar position of lacking employment. AI is ravaging all except senior+ positions, and my two shots at senior responsibilities did not go well on the whole. I can probably get there, but it would take more time than I have to invest, realistically. The amount of coaching, therapy, preparation, and practice I'd need to land a job, and more importantly to succeed in it, feels overwhelming. We don't have much help with the kids, and daycare is WAY too expensive.\n\nWhat's the path now? It's not like it once was where the only huge hurdle was passing an interview. I've failed at two roles now, even if I feel there were positive aspects. I've replayed the reasons for these outcomes dozens of times in my head, and the positive things too, but the poor end results remain.",

        "content": "I'm a front-end developer with 5 years of experience, primarily in React, and I'm feeling pretty stagnated in my current role. It's a constant battle with imposter syndrome, especially watching friends in data engineering, lead roles, or consulting. It feels like front-end is seen as less complex, and that really gets to me. Also, I feel that front-end may be the first role to be impacted by AI. I have some backend experience and the path feels overwhelming.\n\nI'm trying to upskill by learning high-level concepts like system design (theoretical), OOP, and diving deeper into backend technologies. But the sheer volume of what to learn is just paralyzing. \n\nSo, here's where I desperately need your advice: what are the most impactful practical steps I can take? Should I dedicate my time to implementing these theoretical learnings into personal projects and building full systems, or is it more strategic to just focus on theory and aggressively hunt for a new job? What skills genuinely offer future-proofing and combat this feeling of being left behind?",

        "content": "I'll be graduating university in Canada next summer (I'm a Canadian citizen) and am thinking about which offer to take.\n\nI've done internships at both companies so am already familiar with my team + general work culture. Note all numbers below are in US dollars, not Canadian dollars.\n\n**Offer 1:**\n\n* Role: New Grad SWE @ Big Tech in USA\n* Compensation: 240K TC (180K base + 60K in RSUs)\n* Location: Bay Area, fully in-person\n* Pros:\n   * Getting a big company name on my resume is good for career growth\n   * I work on large-scale distributed systems, using Rust and Golang, which is really cool\n* Cons:\n   * Higher cost of living than Canada (food + rent)\n   * It's fully in-person in the Bay Area, so I'll be away from family and friends in Canada\n   * Below average work-life balance (it's common to work until 6pm)\n   * I have to be part of an on-call rotation, and it's fairly common to get multiple alerts everyday\n   * RSUs are at a high valuation, and will only increase in value if AI continues to rapidly get better\n   * RSUs are not liquid since it's a private company\n\n**Offer 2:**\n\n* Role: Tech Lead @ Tiny Startup in Canada\n* Compensation: 240K TC (240K base + no equity)\n* Location: Canada, fully remote\n* Pros:\n   * I can live at home in Canada, free rent and healthy food (if I move out to live on my own, cost of living is cheaper)\n   * Better work-life balance, since work is remote and on-call only happens during big feature releases a few times a year\n* Cons:\n   * Company is tiny, so only person above me is the CEO, so there's very little room for long-term growth / pay raises\n   * Company is not well-known, making it harder to switch to a higher paying job in the future\n   * I work on same (good, but kinda boring) TypeScript tech stack I've been working on for years, so less career growth\n\nI'm tempted to choose the easier, less risky option of the Canadian startup.\n\nThe compensation is what I expected to be making near the end of my career, not the beginning, so maybe I shouldn't worry about career growth as much? In Canada, 240K USD is a crazy amount, especially for a New Grad - it's about about how much Google & Apple pays for senior engineers.\n\n**Which offer should I choose?** I'd love to hear all of your opinions. Especially if you're a Canadian who has worked in the US before (and either stayed or come back to Canada after a few years).\n\n\\---\n\n**Edit:** Someone in the comments said that my usage of big tech was too broad. To clarify, the company I was referring to is one of the leading LLM model companies in the US. There's very few, so take your guess.\n\n**Edit 2:** I'm obviously just gonna put \"Software Engineer\" on my resume if I accept the Canadian company offer, not \"Tech Lead\". I'm 100% not claiming I'm anywhere near as experienced as a senior software engineer. This is just the title the company gives me, which is why I put it in the post.\n\n**Edit 3:** The startup is more stable than the US company because they've existed for a decade without firing/laying off a single person. I guess they're more of a small business than a startup since they've been around for awhile.",

To cover the gap, I listed some freelancing work on my resume. I did work on 2–3 small projects, but the contributions were honestly pretty minimal(it was more about filling the gap while job hunting).\n\nNow I’m wondering:\n\n* Do I include **my current job on my resume** if I get laid off after just 2 months?\n* Is that better than keeping the freelancing gap longer? So basically saying that I freelanced from April 2025- June 2025\n* Or does having a super short job stint raise more questions than it’s worth?\n* Any other tips or advice that you might have",

But it's been a short while so maybe I feel okay sharing now. Hope I don't jinx it.\n\nI was laid off in October of 2024 from a small consulting company. The company had been contracted at a \\[big tech company\\] for my first year there, and then work dried up so I ended up doing something else for the company. Though, \\[big tech company\\] legally requires that as a contractor, when describing work experience, you're not allowed to say you work for \\[big tech company\\]... you have to point out you are contracted by another company, at \\[big tech company\\]. \n\nIn other words, my work experience leading up to my job hunt was:\n\n* \\[big tech company\\], contracted by \\[consulting company \\] (1 year)\n* \\[consulting company\\] (1 year)\n\nI have severe imposter syndrome, get stuck on Leetcode mediums, feel like I don't possess anything that really makes me special. I've **never** interviewed for a big company before, as I never imagined I could even qualify through technical screenings. I didn't do much job interview research either, other than the \"Blind 75\" lineup of Leetcode problems.\n\nI frequently see people saying doing X or being Y will ruin your chances of getting a job, but I went a step further and really made some major \"mistakes\" during my interviews. So here I was incredibly lucky that things worked out. So the point of this post is just to highlight the absurdity and randomness that can factor into your search. So just believe anything can happen, apply to anything, and be optimistic. \n\nThings I see around this sub that people say will hurt your odds, and I did ALL of them.\n\n* Two column resume layout\n* Not a \"top\" school, public (ranked 30-40)\n* Work at contracting companies\n* Told every interviewer that asked, that I was laid off\n* Late to an interview by 5 minutes\n* Less than average Leetcode skills (50 easy, 50 medium, 3 hard)\n\nBut with each failed interview, I clearly knew where I was lacking, and took home lessons that I focused on hard for the next interview. \n\nFor example, my first interview was with a FAANG company, and it was my first interview in YEARS, let alone my first interview with a big tech company. I was stuttering and stumbling over my words. The company is heavy on behavioral questions so I totally embarrassed myself. I started practicing my storytelling a lot.\n\nWith the next, a medium-sized tech company, I was really enjoying the interview and things were going well. I scheduled each round 2+ weeks away to maximize my preparation time for each one. Just before the hiring manager round, I was told that another candidate accepted an offer and they were cancelling the rest of my interviews. Lesson learned: I should be prepared before any interview is scheduled, and schedule everything at my first availability.\n\nI ended up giving interviews for 6 medium-to-large companies, and received 2 offers. One from FAANG and one from a comparable company. It took me around 7 months – I just accepted an offer in April, and started working a month ago. Both offers were way better than anything I was making before, to the point where I felt relieved I didn't make it through the Amazon interview.\n\nI just want to remind everyone that luck is a major factor in the interview process. Good luck everyone, don't give up and remember anything can happen.\n\n",

It was literally my childhood dream - I finally felt like a \"real hacker.\" Then I jumped into the startup world as a backend dev and eventually shifted to managing their cloud infrastructure.\n\nHere's the thing - after 3 years across various IT fields while in college, I'm completely burned tf out. IT feels like endless chaos and bullshit. Both pentesting and DevOps have buried me under mountains of tasks and drama with devs and clients. The manual testing, red team engagements, and report writing are draining asf. My boss keeps pushing for more certifications.\n\nDon't even get me started on getting pinged at all hours because pipelines \"don't work\" - only to find out some dev forgot to do a proper build on their machine, the build failed, and they blamed the CI pipeline. Between the low pay at both companies and all this stress, I'm burned tf out.\n\nAt this point, I genuinely despise cybersecurity, software development, and even the data science BS I'm learning at university. \n\nI've got multiple offers from banks and other solution companies in both fields with way better pay, but I feel paralyzed. I don't want to screw over the companies that gave me my first opportunities at such a young age. I want to leave on good terms, but I'm stuck.\n\nHonestly not sure what to do anymore. Maybe therapy? \n\n**TLDR:** 3 years in IT across pentesting/DevOps while in college, completely burned out despite good opportunities. Lost all passion but feel guilty about leaving companies that gave me my start.",

Maybe its the fact I am using AI to write my cover letter. I am trying to use Indeed and LinkedIn. Where are you guys applying and how are you doing it? I am looking for iOS Developer roles. About 10 YOE.\n\nI have simplify to help me with links. A resume that covers most ATS required keywords. Is there some kind of trick I am not doing. Normally I get at least one or two interviews. I don't have any FAANG experience. But the companies I have worked at are known. At least some of them. This is a bit of a rant, but I don't want to get started off wrong. How should I be applying?\n\nEdit: I posted my resume here [https://imgur.com/a/IARhhgj](https://imgur.com/a/IARhhgj)\n\nEdit: After a lot of good feedback I updated my resume. It is one page. More to the point and has less fluff: [https://imgur.com/a/lygXUN7](https://imgur.com/a/lygXUN7)\n\nEdit: I am using this for my formats: [https://latexresu.me/generator/templates](https://latexresu.me/generator/templates)\n\nEdit: Can't thank you guys enough. Got a lot of brutally honest answers (I mean this is reddit...). I now am getting the gist. \n\n1. Resume - Short, compact, with metrics and targeted for a specific role. Make a few if you have to.\n\n2. LinkedIn - Use for connecting. Make it more generic.\n\n3. Applying - Use all the tools necessary, but write your own cover letter. Make it short and sweet.\n\n4. General - Its hard for most people out there. I know I am gonna have to switch from mobile to backend or something. Maybe I will try and my luck in the AI developer field... Anyways Thanks guys.

I previously worked in sales, and decided I needed to pivot (to a field I was passionate about) about two years ago. Worked pretty hard to learn programming, got a BSCS at WGU (bleh, I know) and here I am. \n\nThe tech stack is mostly a mix of very old Java applications and some newer React stuff. Seems like devs are kind of doing it all - front end, back end, testing, you name it! It's fun and I've been exposed to a lot off cool technologies. I've mostly been doing the typical entry level guy stuff - add a GUI option to automate this database change we get hit with a lot, learn our no/low code platform and help us convert legacy apps to it, help us change this PDF export, all that kind of stuff. A few apps we maintain are getting moved to the cloud over the next year, and I've expressed interest with the managers in helping with that. Overall, it seems really laid back and everyones being extremely helpful as I learn and giving me more than enough time (and space) to do everything. \n\nI'm in a LCOL area, and the job is hybrid (2 days a week in office), I get great health insurance, and I'm just really thankful to have a job! Honestly, I love it. My coworkers are great, everyones so chill, it's a laid back environment, an absolute dream to me coming out of my last job. That being said, pay is on the low end of the scale ($60,000) and I get it - I have no practical experience. I'm ok with starting here and taking a pay cut from my last role, but I do have ambition. I'm worried that I'm not gaining experience on new and cool tech stacks, I'm worried about the no code app conversions. I want to grow, and level up my income. \n\nWhat are some things I should be doing to make the most of this opportunity?",

I started a new one at a company that I heard amazing things about, how everyone was great and how leaders were super supportive, I was genuinely excited.\n\nI started in January, onboarding was a bit messy but eventually I figured it out, I had my first oficial feedback session on 09.04, all positive, a few things to improve but the official document statement said that I was on track to complete my 6 months probation. Ever since that feedback I didn’t have any other official feedback, my manager and I talked about projects, I worked on improving what I had to improve, all our conversations were positive. There was going to be a offsite next week - well this is still happening, but I’m won’t be there - where my manager were telling me things and activities for the team. She doesn’t live at the same city that I do, so Tuesday (10.06) was the first time we’ve met in person, we talked about the offsite, she was very friendly and then, Wednesday, on our regular 1:1, not even like a separate meeting, she says that I did not completed it the requirements and therefore I was no longer at the company. I asked for examples of what was wrong, she didn’t tell me, I asked why she didn’t say it before, she had 02 months to provide more feedback saying what was not working and helping me in what I needed, I mean, is her job too, she invested time, money and energy to hire and train me but ,she didn’t say anything either. It was a stab in my back,  it is astonishing how someone can be so cold. I honestly have no idea, I’m reliving all my steps and I can’t find something or a little somethings that led to this. I even thought that it could have been homophobia, I’m bi and since this is pride month, when we met I was wearing some pride apparel, but I think this is a stretch.\n\nNow I’m here, on my CV there is a 10 month job and now a 5 months job and I’m thinking I’ll never find a place again cause who would hire someone like this? I am really lost, do HR really care so much if you look like a job hopper?\n\nFor context I have a little over 10 years experience in performance marketing/tech and jobs where I stayed almost 4 years but still, this looks so bad.

        "content": "Hi everyone !\n\nIn the French tech industry — especially in software engineering — companies relies massively on external contractors through infamous service companies called ESNs (between us, we call these companies \"les marchands de viande\" (translation : 'meat dealers')). But does this model exist to the same extent in the US, Canada, UK, Australia..., or do companies there prefer a more direct approach to hiring ?\n\n**Here’s how it typically works in France, and why it feels problematic :**\n\n* **Heavy use of ESNs (consulting companies)** : Most engineers work on long-term projects (sometimes several years) for client companies, but are officially employees of a consulting company\n* **Claimed flexibility** : Companies say it’s easier to end a contractor’s mission but the same is true for permanent employees on a trial period\n* **Supposed lighter HR workload** : In theory, ESNs handle hiring, but the client still interviews and evaluates candidates themselves\n* **\"Temporary\" reinforcement :** Most missions last so long that consultants become de facto internal staff but without the benefits or recognition\n\nIn reality, the drawbacks are significant :\n\n* **More expensive** over time than hiring internal staff\n* **Little to no training** from ESNs : consultants have to upskill on their own\n* **High job insecurity** : consultants can be removed or relocated with very little notice\n* **A general lack of respect** : Many ESNs treat software engineers like interchangeable resources rather than skilled professionals. Since a business developer gets a 2000€ bonus each time he places a consultant on a project, some business developers may not give a fuck whether the mission matches the consultant’s skills or career goals or if the project is far from the consultant's home. And if the mission fails put all the blame on the consultant. Btw, since ESN have to pay compensations to fire an employee, their \"secret\" technique to get rid of an someone is to repeatedly relocate consultants across the country to uninteresting projects, hoping the employee will eventually resign on their own. But I won't elaborate on all the bad practices of ESNs in this post, because I could write a whole book on this subject.\n* **And definitely the worst of all : LOWER SALARIES** compared to internal employees with similar skills. Half the money the consultant earns goes to the ESN.\n\nThis system creates a kind of vicious circle :\n\nlow pay —> less savings —> more pressure to accept poor conditions —> repeat\n\nAt the end, I don’t see who actually wins here aside from the ESN profiting from both sides.\n\n**The English-speaking countries model (as I understand it)**\n\n* Companies hire engineers as full-time employees, even for short-term needs — it's the 'hire quick, fire quick' approach\n* There's less protection, but also more autonomy and transparency\n* Workers can earn higher salaries because there’s no intermediary between them and the employer\n\nTo me, this seems healthier even if it’s more unstable.\n\nBut maybe it's just an impression, so I’d really like to know : Is this accurate ?\n\n**To sum up, my questions for engineers in English-speaking countries :**\n\n1. Do companies rely heavily on contractors, or is direct hiring the norm ?\n2. Are there equivalents to the French-style ESN system ?\n3. Does the “hire quick, fire quick” approach actually make the work more efficient ?\n\nI’m asking all this out of curiosity and a bit of frustration. This is quite a hot topic in France. Here, the current system seems to serve the interests of consulting firms more than the people actually doing the work.  \nSo I wonder : is the “Anglo-American” model actually better, or does it simply have different drawbacks ?  \nBecause honestly, if the French model turns out to be significantly worse for building a career, I'm seriously considering moving abroad to have a decent quality of life.\n\nLooking forward to reading your perspectives.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I consistently make mistakes and fail to see certain test cases (I work with highly intricate legacy code) and break customers. I feel that my wins at this company are few and far between while my mistakes are constantly haunting me.\n\nI feel that my manager (and other higher up devs) have lost all trust in me and I'm worried about losing my job—I don't have any indication that this is the case, but it's just a feeling I have. I don't have much motivation anymore and even if I do somehow muster some up, another mistake is right around the corner to knock me back down. I do pretty well with correcting my mistakes as soon as possible, but I'm not sure that matters much.\n\nI also feel that my mistakes are so amateur at times that I wonder what I'm even doing in this career—I feel that I'm just not smart enough for this field. My confidence in myself feels like it's at an all time low in just about every aspect of my life now. I know this seems like a case of imposter syndrome, but I think I'm beyond that at this point.\n\nI'm making this post because I'm coming off of a couple of dumb recent mistakes and I'm pretty overwhelmed and demoralized at the moment. I guess I could just use some advice and maybe some other perspectives on how after 5 years at this job, I've somehow seemed to have regressed. Anyone else feel this way (or felt this way before)?

Why should they program in natural languages over the programming languages they are already productive in? It, also, causes learning loss in new programmers like handing a calculator to a kid learning arithmetic.\n\nIf you are selling the ability to program in natural language to non-programmers, you need a much more mature product that generates and maintains production-grade code because non-programmers don’t understand architecture or how to maintain or debug code.\n\nIf you are selling the ability to automate repetitive tasks, how is GenAI superior to a vast amount of tooling already on the market?\n\nThe only application that makes sense to me is a “buddy” that does tasks you are not proficient at - generating test cases for programmers, explaining code etc. But, then, it has limits in how good it is.\n\nIt appears companies have decided to buy into a product that is not fully mature and can get in the way of getting work done.

As she got diagnosed with NPD and BPD I looked into it and the covert narc description happened to completely match my brother.\n\nI had a lot of mental health challenges growing up but I managed to keep it together when it came to my education. Got A\\* Maths, A\\* Computer science A-levels, graduated CS with a First-Class Integrated Masters from a reputable university. But when I came across this piece of news my whole world flipped upside down. So many things started to make sense and I went through a wild emotional rollercoaster. Hadn't cried in 10 years since I was 13 but for at least 2 weeks I would be weeping 6hrs/day and I honestly didn't know what to make of my life.  \nI had to get a job fast after graduating since I didn't want to live back home so I got hired at McDonalds. My mental health was fragile during this time and it took me 6 months to get a job in retail. Only a year after that had I actually started applying to CS jobs.\n\nAs soon as my CV hit the market I started getting calls from recruiters, at least 2 calls/week. I started making some progress with some companies but a friend of mine from McDonalds hit me up and convinced me to start a business. It's a long story with him, but basically he came to the UK by selling his business for 40K pounds. He had a small thing where he bought bicycle parts in some dodgy auction and used them to make bicycles and sell them. He worked at McD to earn the rest of what he needed to pay off his tuition fee (he had to pay 21K/year as he was not from the EU/UK). I resonated with the idea of being self-employed and the guy seemed competent enough and I thought YOLO, why not.\n\n3-4 months into that whole process I realised I really craved some financial security and it'd be a waste not to use my degree. So I quit and started applying to jobs again. I got very close with a video game apprenticeship (was the 11th applicant out of 300 but they only had 10 positions). And I also got an interview for a job through a uni connection that went really well. I had been given a call and was told that I have the job! just have to be on the lookout for HR to contact me. No contact, I stayed in touch via email and eventually called and the hiring manager told me he doesn't know what's happening and the job seems to be in the air. He's signed everything and so has his boss he is just on lookout for the final business approval. He told me he'll contact me if anything changes, so I can only assume nothing changed.\n\nAfter this whole foray I was a little bit low and my friend sweeps in again to offer me to start our own thing. Great timing. Won't go into the details of that but we did a lot of work but were delayed by waiting for my passport to arrive from Romania to the UK as we needed ID to start the business bank account. Just when we were starting to do outreach and get some customers the guy started behaving very poorly towards me. Very passive aggressive, would tell me to do shit for him, etc. When I confronted him about it he called me sensitive, etc. I just couldn't deal with that kind of behaviour so we split up.\n\nIt's been a while at this point since I actually graduated and I learned so many things about myself. I thought for a while maybe I don't want to do CS and I went on to try to be self-employed. It turns out I'm a little too fragile for that at the moment, I don't quite have enough self-determination for it and I've lived for 2.5 years in a constant state of anxiety (as my current workplace is quite toxic and demanding as well). I just need a little bit of breathing room and some financial stability to pull myself together enough to actually attempt something like that.\n\nThis brings me to now, 3 years later, applying to jobs yet again but now I'm honestly worried since it seems like the market is not in a great place, and my gap is getting quite large.\n\nIs there any point in me applying to CS related jobs at the moment? Does anyone have any advice for how to stand out in this market given this disadvantage?",

Think of agents as software systems that use AI to perform tasks on behalf of users or other systems. Agents let you tell them what you want (often in natural language), and do things like scour the web (and various data sources) and summarize results, engage in deep research, write code, find anomalies, highlight interesting insights, translate language and code into other variants, and automate a lot of tasks that consume our time.  \n...  \nAs we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this memo?",

I managed to get 2 years of internships during my bachelors (1 year at AMD, 1 year another lesser known company) hoping it'd give me an edge but I'm not finding success at all here in Canada, after around 400 applications I've been given like 4 technical assessments and 1 interview only. While I know I'll be spammed with '400 isnt nearly enough' I still want to do what I can to improve my odds, of course I am still applying and will continue to till I get something.\n\nI have heard its better to look in the US. I was already considering this due to having a lot of family in NY and was applying from linkedIn to both Canada and NYC. I know to check the 'authorized to work here' as yes and to check 'sponsorship needed' as no (then later explain that you're a Canadian and a TN visa is far easier) but despite that I've only gotten 1 response from the US. \n\nI'm sure my resume isn't perfect, but I've had some Sr engineers that I've gotten to know over the years as well as a recruiter I know well look it over and say its quite good for a new grad especially the 2 years of industry experience so I don't think its holding me back.\n\nI've heard someone mention to apply to US from LinkedIn you need to buy a US phone number or you get filtered instantly. Furthermore I've noticed of course my LinkedIn profile has my location as within Canada, I figure I'd have to change this too but currently I'm applying everywhere in Canada and in NY and I worry doing that will then blacklist me from Canadian roles and I just don't know if that's a good idea? I also worry that maybe thats just uneeded steps and has nothing to do with why I'm hearing nothing from the US applications.\n\nAny advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated. While I would love to be picky with a job the reality is I'm graduating in a few days and I need income asap to support myself and start my career, at this point I just want to break into the industry idc where or the salary I just need to get my foot in the door.",

In this topic, I would like to know what effective communication or soft skillsmeans to you, how to practice it and how to present it. \n\n\n\nDuring each half or full year evaluation, my direct manager comes to me with feedback on what the client(s) and other colleagues (usually senior managers) have said about me - it is always along these lines: technically exceptional but should work on communication. I tried to ask what does it mean but got only vague answers.\n\nOn my part, I am always nice and open to other people - at least thats what I think of myself, but sometimes I have to draw a thick line when, for example: someone entrusts me with a task that goes beyond my competence or scope of duties - think of setting up infrastructure, when its managed by client infra team and I got no permissions. Of course, I do not say \"no\" leaving the person alone with the problem, I suggest who can help and how to do it, sometimes I even engage people to help. \n\n\n\nI have the impression that any objection, which is not really an objection, and I really cannot do certain things myself, is perceived as my flaw. Of course, it doesn't work the other way around - sometimes people, like the product owner from the client's side, doesn't speak kindly to me, or uses micromanagement but it's fine, no one pays attention to it, arguing \"it is what it is, he was probably nervous\". If the situation were reversed, I would probably be removed from the project. Often, even despite previous suggestions that something might go wrong, my opinion is ignored until the thing happens and then there are complaints about it. \n\n\n\nHere I come to the conclusion that communication is simply taking everything upon yourself, nodding to everything (being a yes-man) and pretending that everything is going well, even when it isn't? I don't think so, that's why I'm asking you. I would be grateful for any feedback and materials regarding soft skills and communication.",

Recently I've become a bit disillusioned with the direction my current employer is being run and got 3 more cold-calls, all for the same job I mentioned before. I engaged with all 3 and confirmed they're all the same role, although each agency has given me a different salary expectation/range. I ended up following through with the one that paid the most, but should I have countered the other recruiters with the higher offer to try and get a bidding war started? \n\nThe salary is in the middle of their bands for a senior dev and is 50% more than what I currently get paid, which I'm fairly happy with. I had the final interview yesterday and am just waiting on the verdict and potential offer to come through (they've already asked me for referees).",

        "content": "Hey guys, here’s my situation. I’m a full stack software engineer at a midsize non-tech company (but still well known) with 4.5 YOE (1.5 YOE in data analysis before that, so I guess 6 YOE total). I’ve been cold applying for remote software engineering roles but I’m not really getting any bites. I know the remote market is insanely competitive right now, but I’d really like one and I’m only considering switching roles if the new one is remote.\n\nFor some more background, I have an unrelated bachelors from an Ivy League school. I have a feeling that this is one of the main reasons I’m not getting much traction - I’m probably being filtered out immediately at a lot of places for not having a CS degree, especially in this market. I was getting a good chunk more interviews 2-3 years ago.\n\nLately, I’ve been contemplating doing a MSCS to make up for that shortcoming. Last year, I got accepted into GT OMSCS but I decided to not attend after thinking heavily about the time commitment. It would’ve taken me about 3 years and I would’ve completely had to sacrifice my quality of life due to the programs rigor. I have a wife and now a baby on the way, and my wife and I are ready to expand our family even further in the short term future, so I just didn’t think it was worth the sacrifice. Plus, now it’s been a year so my offer of admission is no longer valid anyway.\n\nHere’s the thing. WGU just came out with an MSCS that I think I can get done in 6 months, if not a year. That time horizon and day-to-day commitment is a lot more palatable to be honest. Also, my employer is willing to pay for it 100%.\n\nAll that said, do you think it’s worth it for me to do the WGU MSCS so that I can meet the CS degree requirement at a lot of places/avoid getting filtered out early in the process? The way that I’m thinking about it is that I can always take it off my resume if I feel it’s causing a negative impact on my profile. What do you guys think? Would it be beneficial to my profile or make it worse? At this point, it’s either WGU MSCS or nothing - I’m just at a point in my life where I’m done with higher education otherwise and want to focus on life itself, so I’m not considering any other masters programs.\n\nI do have 3 YOE working remotely due to COVID and I’ve reflected that on my resume, plus some promotions, so I don’t think it’s a track record issue.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello. I've been working for around 2.5 years in a startup as a senior backend engineer.\n\nWhen I started, we were 2 on the team, under the CTO. 1 person left. We hired someone terrible, and we didn't continue with him after a few months. I proposed to not replace this person with anyone because the workload was ok-ish just for me. I was the only backend engineer for more than one year, managing (successfully) around 1/3 third of the product (several microservices etc).\n\nDuring this period, the CTO was changed because of investors' wishes. A few months back, we hired a couple of more people for my team, but they are nowhere close to my productivity or domain knowledge, and are on-par or below my general technical knowledge. \n\nI get along with everyone, I have good communication skills, and I've gotten 2 raises during this time. This is why I was expecting to become a Tech lead when it was time to have one.\n\nUnfortunately, we (i was included in the call) are interviewing for an external technical lead. This has been extremely disappointing. When asking my CTO, he said that they wanted someone with experience in leading teams who could effectively help with the refactors that we need, and so on.\n\nI'm more than capable (or at least that's what i think) of planning and managing long projects and make them happen through incremental steps, but this new CTO has never let me do that because he always proposes more long-term, breaking refactorings. So we are kind of stuck in urgent things and bugs (that obviously should not happen on the first place) and not moving forward with the important topics.\n\nI have the impression that they (the CTO and the CEO) have already made the decision not to count on me to promote to teach lead, because otherwise they would have, at least, spoken with me about what I'm not good at or something.\n\nSo Im wondering if it make sense to push for it anyway. For example, writing a detailed technical proposal of the refactors that we need, and having another conversation with my CTO. But one part of me thinks that this would be a waste of my time and would only lead to an uncomfortable conversation in which no one wins. \n\nWhat do you think? Any similar experience? Thanks!",

My BA in CS didn't teach me much about front end (react, graphql...) but I have had so much fun learning these things :)\n\nI feel like I've hit a learning plateau, though, and many people my age are pursuing masters degrees or attending other types of schools. I feel like traditional CS masters programs are pretty CS foundations focused (i.e algs, data, machine learning) and I don't see many that focus on user interfaces... I also stalked all of the senior engineers I work with, and none of them have masters. I advocated for myself in the workplace and get to work on the UI for internal tools which is fun.\n\nI currently live in SoCal and don't want to move for a full-on in-person program. Is it even worth it to get a masters? I've found some certificate programs and I believe my company will pay up to $700 per credit. If I were to look for more sr roles with my CS degree already, would a certificate help? When the time comes for me to jump for a sr role I would have at least 5+ years of experience.\n\nI just want to really be a front end engineer who really works on making beautiful UIs that are easy to use, accessible, and look great.

Manager's feedback was thoughtful and mostly glowing (\"\\[Me\\] demonstrates exceptional breadth; eagerly dives into new languages, SDKs, and frameworks, often delivering functional features very quickly.\", \"\\[Me\\] is exemplary in client follow-ups; responding within four business hours and documenting decisions clearly.\"). Criticisms were small things, presumably because they have to write something down for that (\"Make sure every demo and screen-share is up and running before the guest joins\", \"Sometimes shows visible frustration when stakeholders pivot\" \\[who doesn't lol\\]).\n\nBad news: did not get a bonus, or a salary increase. CEO explains that usually X% of profit is reserved for the employee bonus pool, but it was a bad year for company so this year the bonus pool was 0. Salary increases were only for promotions.\n\nAlthough this technically means I'm being paid less, it could be worse. My understanding is that not doing bonuses or salary increases is just one of the ways companies use to avoid having to fire people. Sucks because I was already being paid below market rate, but oh well. I plan to job-hop in the next year anyways.\n\n",

This would require me to get a MSW, which I'm aiming to start in 2026.\n\nIt occurred to me when talking to other people who majored in Computer Science that a lot of other students also don't have much interest in continuing down this field. Some of the people I met in CS have not made a program without ChatGPT since 2022, and have no projects, internships, or job experience. It also occurred to me that a lot of CS subreddits don't offer great advice, giving platitudes that the job market will soon improve, or just advising to continue grinding Leetcode and applying to more entry-level positions.\n\nIf anyone is interested in a community for people who are looking to do something besides CS- whether going to grad school, or finding an unrelated job, I made /r/leavingCS.
