The assignment itself was pretty straightforward an ETL job. I do not have previous experience working as a data engineer.\n\nI built out some basic tests in Python using pytest. I set up fixtures to mock the boto3 S3 client, wrote a few unit tests to verify that my transformation logic produced the expected results, and checked that my code called the right S3 methods with the right parameters. \n\nThe interviewer were showering me with praise for the tests I have written. They kept saying, we do not see candidate writing tests. They keep pointing out how good I was just because of these tests.\n\nBut here’s the thing: my tests were super simple.  I didn’t write any integration tests against Glue or do any end-to-end pipeline validation. I just mocked the S3 client and verified my Python code did what it was supposed to do. \n\nI come from a background in software engineering, so i have a habit of writing extensive test suites. \n\nLooks like just because of the tests, I might have a higher probability of getting this role.\n\nHow rigorously do we test in data engineering?",

        "author": "PotokDes",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Recently, I made a post asking: Why don’t data engineers test like software engineers do? The post sparked a lively discussion and became quite popular, trending for two days on r/dataengineering.\n\nMany insightful points were raised in the comments. Here, I’d like to summarize the main arguments and share my perspective.\n\nThe most upvoted comment highlighted the distinction between data testing and logic testing. While this is an valid observation, it was somewhat tangential to the main question, so I’ll address it separately.\n\nMost of the other comments centered around three main reasons:\n\n1. Testing is costly and time-consuming.\n2. Many analytical engineers lack a formal computer science background.\n3. Testing is often not implemented because projects are volatile and engineers have little control over source systems.\n\nAnd here is my take on these:\n\n1. Testing requires time and is costly\n\n**Reddit:** The decision to invest in testing often depends on the company and the role data plays within its structure. If data pipelines are not central to the company’s main product, many engineers do not see the value in spending additional resources to ensure these pipelines work as expected.\n\n**My perspective**: Tests are a tool. If you consider your project simple enough and do not plan to scale it, then perhaps you do not need them.\n\n**Reddit:**: It can be more advantageous for engineers to deliver incomplete solutions, as they are often the only ones who can fix the resulting technical debt and are paid more for doing so.\n\n**My perspective**: Tight deadlines and fixed requirements mean that testing is usually the first thing to be cut. This allows engineers to deliver a solution and close a ticket, and if a bug is found later, extra time and effort are allocated from a different budget. While this approach is accepted by many managers, it is not ideal, as the overall time wasted on fixing issues often exceeds the time it would have taken to test the solution upfront.\n\n**Reddit:**: Stakeholders are rarely willing to pay for testing.\n\n**My perspective**: Testing is a tool for engineers, not stakeholders. Stakeholders pay for a working product, and it should be the producer's responsibility to ensure that the product meets the requirements. If I personally were about to buy a product from a store and someone told me to pay extra for testing, I would also refuse. If you are certain about your product do not test it, but do not ask non-technical people how to do your job.\n\n2. Many analytical engineers lack a formal computer science background.  \n**Reddit:**: Especially in analytical and scientific engineering, many people are not formally trained as software engineers. They are often self-taught programmers who write scripts to solve their immediate problems but may be unaware of software engineering practices that could make their projects more maintainable.\n\n**My perspective**: This is a common and ongoing challenge. Computers are tools used by almost everyone, but not everyone who uses a computer is a programmer. Many successful projects begin with someone trying to solve a problem in their own field, and in analytics, domain knowledge is often more important than programming expertise when building initial pipelines. In companies just starting their data initiatives, pipelines are typically built by analysts. As long as these pipelines meet expectations, this approach is acceptable. However, as complexity grows, changes become more costly, and tracking down the source of problems can become a nightmare.\n\n3. No control of source data  \n**Reddit:**: Data engineers often have no control over the source data, which can lead to issues when the schema changes or when unexpected data is encountered. This makes it difficult to implement testing.\n\n**My perspective**: This one of the assumptions of data engineering systems. Depending on the type of the data engineering system, data engineers very rarely will have a say in there. Only where we are creating the analytical system for the operational data, we might have a conversation with the operational system maintainers.\n\nIn other cases when we are scraping the data from the web or calling external APIs, it is not possible. So what are the ways that we could do to help in such situations?\n\nWhen the problem is related to the evolution of schema (case when data fields are added or removed, data type changes): First we might use schema-on-read strategy, where we store the raw data as they are ingested, for example in JSON format in the staging models, we extract only the fields that are relevant to us. In this case, we do not care if new fields are added. When columns that were using are removed or changed the the pipeline will break, but if we have tests they will tell us what is the exact reason why. We have a place to start investigation and decide how to fix it\n\nIf the problem is unexpected data the issues are similar. It’s impossible to anticipate every possible variation in source data, and equally impossible to write pipelines that handle every scenario. The logic in our pipelines is typically designed for the data identified during initial analysis. If the data changes, we cannot guarantee that the analytics code will handle it correctly. Even simple data tests can alert us to these situations, indicating, for example: “We were not expecting data like this—please check if we can handle it.” This once again saves time on root cause analysis by pinpointing exactly where the problem is and where to start investigating a solution.",

        "author": "dsiegs1",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering.\n\nSo about 2 months ago when DuckDB announced their instant SQL feature. It looked super slick, and I immediately thought there's no reason on earth to use this with snowflake because of egress (and abunch of other reasons) but it's cool.\n\nSo I decided to build it anyways: Introducing Snowducks\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s50m6as7ge8f1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd6492295dae218aa8ff2d27b517f2992c389903\n\nAlso - if my goal was to just use instant SQL - it would've been much more simple. But I wanted to use Ducklake. For Reasons. What I built was a caching mechanism using the ADBC driver which checks the query hash to see if the data is local (and fresh), if so return it. If not pull fresh from Snowflake, with automatic limit of records so you're not blowing up your local machine. It then can be used in conjunction with the instant SQL features.\n\nI started with Python because I didn't do any research, and of course my dumb ass then had to rebuild it in C++ because DuckDB extensions are more complicated to use than a UDF (but hey at least I have a separate cli that does this now right???). Learned a lot about ADBC drivers, DuckDB extensions, and why you should probably read documentation first before just going off and building something.\n\nAnyways, I'll be the first to admit I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I also don't even know if I plan to do more....or if it works on anyone else's machine besides mine, but it works on mine and that's cool.\n\nAnyways feel free to check it out - [Github](https://github.com/danjsiegel/snowducks)",

But today that changes, as we're launching [Firebolt Core](https://github.com/firebolt-db/firebolt-core), a self-managed version of Firebolt's query engine with all the same features, performance improvements, and optimizations. It's built to scale out as a production-grade, distributed query engine capable of providing low latency, high concurrency analytics, ELT at scale, and particularly powerful analytics on Iceberg, but it's also capable of running on small datasets on a single laptop for those looking to give it a lightweight try.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Core and its launch, Firebolt's CTO Mosha Pasumansky and VP of Engineering Benjamin Wagner wrote [a blog explaining more about what it is, why we built it, and what you can do with it.](https://www.firebolt.io/blog/introducing-firebolt-core) It also touches on the topic of open source - which Core isn't.\n\nOne extra goodie is that thanks to all the work that's gone into Firebolt and the fact that we included all of the same performance improvements in Core, it's immediately debuting at the top spot on the [Clickbench benchmark.](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/) Of course, we're aware that performance isn't everything, but Firebolt is built from the ground up to be as performant as possible, and it's meant to power analytical and application workloads where minimizing query latency is critical. When that's the space you're in, performance matters a lot... and so you can probably see why we're excited.\n\nStrongly recommend giving it a try yourself, and let us know what you think!",

However, I feel a bit overwhelmed by the many tools and skills in the data engineering field, and I’m not sure what to focus on after that.\n\nMy question is: what should I prioritize learning to improve my career prospects and grow as a Data Engineer?\n\nShould I specialize in Snowflake (maybe get certified)? Focus on dbt? Or should I prioritize learning orchestration tools like Airflow and CI/CD practices? Or should I dive deeper into cloud platforms like Azure or Databricks?\n\nOr would it be even more valuable to focus on fundamentals like data modeling, architecture, and system design?\n\nI was also thinking about reading the following books:\n\t•\tFundamentals of Data Engineering — Joe Reis & Matt Housley\n\t•\tThe Data Warehouse Toolkit — Ralph Kimball\n\t•\tDesigning Data-Intensive Applications — Martin Kleppmann\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice — especially from experienced Data Engineers.

        "content": "I know \"modern data stack\" is basically a cargo cult at this point, and focusing on tooling first over problem-solving is a trap many of us fall into.\n\nBut still, I think it's incredible how difficult simply getting a client to even consider the self-hosted or open-source version of a thing (e.g. Dagster over ADF, dbt over...bespoke SQL scripts and Databricks notebooks) still is in 2025.\n\nSeems like if a client doesn't immediately recognize a product as having backing and support from a major vendor (Qlik, Microsoft, etc), the idea of using it in our stack is immediately shot down with questions like \"why should we use unproven, unsupported technology?\" and \"Who's going to maintain this after you're gone?\" Which are fair questions, but often I find picking the tools that feel easy and obvious at first end up creating a ton of tech debt in the long run due to their inflexibility. The whole platform becomes this brittle, fragile mess, and the whole thing ends up getting rebuilt.\n\nSynapse is a great example of this - I've worked with several clients in a row who built some crappy Rube Goldberg machine using Synapse pipelines and notebooks 4 years ago and now want to switch to Databricks because they spend 3-5x what they should and the whole thing just fell flat on its face with zero internal adoption. Traceability and logging were nonexistent. Finding the actual source for a \"gold\" report table was damn near impossible.\n\nI got a client to adopt dbt years ago for their Databricks lakehouse, but it was like pulling teeth - I had to set up a bunch of demos, slide decks, and a POC to prove that it actually worked. In the end, they were super happy with it and wondered why they didn't start using it sooner. I had other suggestions for things we could swap out to make our lives easier, but it went nowhere because, again, they don't understand the modern DE landscape or what's even possible. There's a lack of trust and familiarity.\n\nIf you work in the industry, how the hell do you convince your boss's boss to let you use actual modern tooling? How do you avoid the trap of \"well, we're a Microsoft shop, so we only use Azure-native services\"?",

        "content": "I moved from a startup into a corporate job ( digital banking ) a few months ago. I’m from Malaysia , for context. I’m still under probation. And honestly, I don’t know anymore if I’m underperforming, or if I’m just stuck in a dysfunctional culture that burns people out.\n\nIn my previous role, I worked as a backend engineer. I had autonomy. Things moved fast. Feedback was immediate. Now, I’m in an environment where expectations are vague, processes are messy, and communication is passive-aggressive.\n\nOne example: we have a support schedule to help vendors load data into internal systems. They can’t do it directly, so someone from our side has to run everything manually. It’s basic, repetitive work , I once suggested scripting it to make the process cleaner. That suggestion was ignored. So we keep doing it the hard way.\n\nRecently I got pinged after working hours to join a “5-minute call to load something” , something that would run for 10 hours. There was no advance notice, just the assumption I’d be available. I was already off shift, but even then, the next day came with a passive-aggressive remark: “Didn’t expect this from you.” This wasn’t the first time either.\n\nThen there’s the feedback I’ve been given. My boss told me twice , that I lack “initiative.” The most recent example was over documentation. I was asked to update some system design docs. I did. I even left a comment inside tagging him, asking for input , which should’ve triggered an email notification. But I didn’t follow up in Teams because I got pulled into other work. I was literally about to update him the next morning when he messaged me and immediately launched into a rant about me needing to be more proactive and take ownership. Even though the work had been done. However, sometime he would dished out praise but rarely. \n\nMeanwhile, I’m putting in 10–15 hour days. I’m exhausted. I forget things. I don’t have any more bandwidth. I’m not even doing meaningful engineering work , just reacting to whatever lands in my inbox or chat window. No ownership, no growth. Just people assuming I’ll pick up anything and everything.\n\nThis is starting to affect my personal life. I carry the resentment home. I’m always tired. I’m checked out even when I’m not working. I literally can’t take a shit without being pulled into a meeting.\n\nSo now I’m asking: is this a sign I’m not fit for this kind of culture? Am I truly missing something basic? Or is this what happens when you take someone from a fast, transparent, builder-type environment and drop them into a place where nobody wants to own problems , they just want someone to quietly clean up the mess?\n\nIf you’ve been through this, I’d appreciate perspective.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**Full disclosure:** I'm part of the team at Databend, and we just published a deep-dive article on User-Defined Functions (UDFs). I’m sharing this here because it tackles a question we see all the time: when and how to move beyond standard SQL for complex logic in a data pipeline. I've made sure to summarize the key takeaways in this post to respect the community's rules on self-promotion.\n\nWe've all been there: your SQL query is becoming a monster of nested `CASE` statements and gnarly regex, and you start wondering if there's a better way. Our goal was to create a practical guide for choosing the right tool for the job.\n\nHere’s a quick breakdown of the approaches we cover:\n\n* **Lambda (SQL) UDFs:** The simplest approach. The guide's advice is clear: **if you can do it in SQL, do it in SQL**. It's the easiest to maintain and debug. We cover using them for simple data cleaning and standardizing business rules.\n* **Python & JavaScript UDFs:** These are the workhorses for most custom logic. The post shows examples for things like:\n   * Using a Python UDF to validate and standardize shipping addresses.\n   * Using a JavaScript UDF to process messy JSON event logs by redacting PII and enriching the data.\n* **WASM (WebAssembly) UDFs:** This is for when you are truly performance-obsessed. If you're doing heavy computation (think feature engineering, complex financial modeling), you can get near-native speed. We show a full example of writing a function in Rust, compiling it to WASM, and running it inside the database.\n* **External UDF Servers:** For when you need to integrate your data warehouse with an existing microservice you already trust (like a fraud detection or matchmaking engine). This lets you keep your business logic decoupled but still query it from SQL.\n\nThe article ends with a \"no-BS\" best practices section and some basic performance benchmarks comparing the different UDF types. The core message is to start simple and only escalate in complexity when the use case demands it.\n\n**You can read the full deep-dive here:** [https://www.databend.com/blog/category-product/Databend\\_UDF/](https://www.databend.com/blog/category-product/Databend_UDF/)\n\nI'd love to hear how you all handle this. What's your team's go-to solution when SQL just isn't enough for the task at hand?",

I’ve been working at the same company with an on-prem mssql DW.\n\nThe DW has been painfully mismanaged since long before I started. Among other things, instead of using it for analytics, many operational processes run through it where no one was bothered to build them in the source systems.\n\nI don’t mind the old techstack, but there is also a lot of operational legacy. No git, no code reviews, no documentation, no ownership, everyone is crammed which leads to low collaboration unless explicitly asked for. \n\nThe job however, have many upsides too. Mainly, the new management since 18 months have recongnized the problems above and are investing in a brand new modern data platform. I am learning by watching and discussing. Further, I’m also paid well given my experience and get along well with my manager (who started 2 years ago).\n\nI have explicitly asked my manager to be moved to work with the new platform (or improve the issues with the current platform) part time, but I’m stuck maintaining legacy while consultants build the new platform. Despite this, I truly believe the company will be great to work at in 2-3 years. \n\nHave anyone else been in a similar situation? Did you stick it out, or would you find a new job? If I stay, how do I improve the culture? I’m situated in Europe in a city where the demand for DE fluctuates.",

But processing each table one by one manually works fine.\n\nTo automate it, I tried using SSIS in Visual Studio. There's a setting in the *Analysis Services Processing Task* to use separate transactions, but the setting won’t save — every time I reopen the task, it resets. So I’m not sure if it’s being applied at all. Possibly a bug?\n\nAs a workaround, I thought of scripting each table process using XMLA and scheduling it in steps. But that would mean one step per table — which is messy and hard to maintain. I also saw references to <BeginTransaction> and <CommitTransaction> in XMLA, but it looks like you can’t run multiple transactions in a single XMLA script unless you’re using a SOAP/XMLA client — not SSMS or Invoke-ASCmd.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. Is there a clean way to process each table in its own transaction (automated)?\n2. Is the \"separate transactions\" checkbox in SSIS known to be buggy? Or is there a workaround?\n3. If XMLA is the best approach, how can I structure it to avoid memory crashes without having to create 20+ steps manually?\n\nAny help or experience appreciated\n\n ",

        "content": "I've built a system where Spark Connect runs behind an API gateway to push/pull data from Delta Lake tables on S3. It's been a massive improvement over our previous Databricks setup — we can transact millions of rows in seconds with much more control.\n\nWhat I want now is user authentication and access control:\n\n* Specifically, I want certain users to have read-only access.\n* They should still be able to submit Spark SQL queries, but no write operations (no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.).\n\nWhen using Databricks, this was trivial to manage via Unity Catalog and OAuth — I could restrict service principals to only have SELECT access. But I'm now outside the Databricks ecosystem using vanilla Spark 4.0 and Spark Connect, which I want to add, has been orders of magnitude more performant and easier to operate, and I’m struggling to find an equivalent.\n\nIs there any way to restrict Spark SQL commands to only allow reads per session/user? Or disallow any write operations at the SQL level for specific users or apps (e.g., via Spark configs or custom extensions)?\n\nEven if there's a way to disable all write operations globally for a given Spark Connect session or app, I could probably work around that for my use case by leveraging those applications at the API layer!\n\nWould appreciate any ideas, even partial ones. Thanks!!!\n\nEDIT: No replies yet but for context I'm able to dump 20M rows in 3s from my Fargate Spark Cluster. I then make queries using [https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.toLocalIterator.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.toLocalIterator.html) via Spark Connect (except in Scala). This lets me receive the results via Arrow and push them lazily into my Websocket response to my users, with a lot less infra code, whereas the Databricks ODBC connection (or JDBC connection, or their own libs) would take 3 minutes to do this, at best. It's just faster, and I think Spark 4 is a huge jump forward.\n\nEDIT2: While Spark Connect is a huge jump forward, using Databricks Connect is the way we are thinking about going with this (as it turns out Databricks connect is just a wrapper with Spark connect so we can still use the local instance as local development and have Databricks hoist our Spark cluster on the cloud; still maintaining the benefits; and as it turns out you can connect to Databricks compute nodes with Spark Connect vanilla and be fine).",

        "author": "Lastrevio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi, I just learned the basics of AWS and I'm thinking of getting my hands dirty and building my first project in it.\n\nI want to call the Spotify API to fetch, on a daily basis, the results of a certain Spotify playlist (haven't decided which yet, but it will most likely be top 50 songs in Romania). From what I know, these playlists update once per day, so my pipeline can run once per day.\n\nThe end goal would be to visualize analytics about this kind of data in some BI tool after I connect to the Athena database, but the reason I am doing this is to practice AWS and to put it as a project on my CV.\n\nHere is how I thought of my data schema so far:\n\nI will have the following tables: f_song, f_song_snapshot, d_artist, d_calendar.\n\nf_song will have an ID as a primary key, the name of the song and all the metadata about the song I can get through Spotify's API (artists, genre, mood, album, etc.). The data loading process for this table will be UPSERT (delta insert).\n\nd_artist will contain metadata about each artist. I am still not sure how to connect this to f_song through some PK-FK pair since a song can have multiple artists and an artist can have multiple songs so I may need to create a new table to break down this many-to-many mapping (any ideas?). I also intend to include a boolean column in this table called \"has_metadata\" for reasons I will explain below. The data loading process will also be upsert.\n\nf_song_snapshot will contain four columns: snapshot_id (primary key), song_id (foreign key to f_song's primary key), timestamp (which represents the date in which that particular song was part of that playlist) and rank (representing the position in the playlist that day from 1 to 50). The data loading process for this table will be ONLY INSERT (pure append).\n\nd_calendar will be a date look-up table that has multiple DATE values and the corresponding day, month, year, month in text, etc. for each date (and it will be connected to f_song_snapshot). I will only load this table once, probably.\n\nNow, how to create this pipeline in AWS? Here are my ideas so far:\n\n1). Lambda function (scheduled to run daily) that calls Spotify's API to get the top 50 songs in that day and all the metadata about them and then dumping this as a JSON file in an S3 bucket.\n\n2). AWS Glue job that is triggered by the appearance of a JSON file in that bucket (i.e.: by the finishing of the previous step) that takes the data from that JSON file and pushes it into f_song and f_song_snapshot. f_song will only be appended if a respective song is not already in it, while f_song_snapshot will *always* be appended. This Glue job will also update d_artist but not all the columns, only the artist_id and artist_name, and only in the cases in which that artist does not already exist, and in the case in which a new artist is inserted, has_metadata will be equal to 0 (false) and all other columns (with the exception of id, name and has_metadata) will be NULL.\n\n3). Lambda function, triggered, by the finishing of the previous step, that makes API calls to Spotify to get the metadata of all the artists in d_artist for whom has_metadata = 0. This information will get dumped as a JSON in another S3 bucket.\n\n4). AWS Glue job that gets triggered by the addition of another file in that artist S3 bucket (by the finishing of the previous step) that updates the rows in d_artist for which has_metadata = 0 with the new information found in the new JSON file (and then sets has_metadata = 1 after it is finished).\n\nHow does this sound? Is there a simpler way to do it or am I on the right track? It's my first time designing a pipeline so complex. Also, how can I connect the M:M relationship between the f_song and d_artist tables?",

        "title": "Chuck Data - Agentic Data Engineering CLI for Databricks (Feedback requested)",
        "author": "caleb-amperity",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all,\n\nMy name is Caleb, I am the GM for a team at a company called Amperity that just launched an open source CLI tool called [Chuck Data](https://chuckdata.ai). \n\nThe tool runs exclusively on Databricks for the moment. We launched it last week as a **free** new offering in research preview to get a sense of whether this kind of interface is compelling to data engineering teams. This post is mainly conversational and looking for reactions/feedback. We don't even have a monetization strategy for this offering. Chuck is free and open source, but just for full disclosure what we're getting out of this is signal to drive our engineering prioritization for our other products.\n\n# General Pitch\n\nThe general idea is similar to Claude Code except where Claude Code is designed for general software development, Chuck Data is designed for data engineering work in Databricks. You can use natural language to describe your use case and Chuck can help plan and then configure jobs, notebooks, data models, etc. in Databricks. \n\nSo imagine you want to set up identity resolution on a bunch of tables with customer data. Normally you would analyze the data schemas, spec out an algorithm, implement it by either configuring an ETL tool or writing some scripts, etc. With Chuck you would just prompt it with \"I want to stitch these 5 tables together\" and Chuck can analyze the data, propose a plan and provide a ML ID res algorithm and then when you're happy with its plan it will set it up and run it in your Databricks account.\n\nStrategy-wise, Amperity has been selling a SAAS CDP platform for a decade and configuring it with services. So we have a ton of expertise setting up \"Customer 360\" models for enterprise companies at scale with any different kind of data. We're seeing an opportunity with the proliferation of LLMs and the agentic concepts where we think it's viable to give data engineers an alternative to ETLs and save tons of time with better tools. \n\nChuck is our attempt to make a tool trying to realize that vision and get it into the hands of the users ASAP to get a sense for what works, what doesn't, and ultimately whether this kind of natural language tooling is appealing to data engineers.\n\nMy goal with this post is to drive some awareness and get anyone who uses Databricks regularly to try it out so we can learn together. \n\n# How to Try Chuck Out\n\nChuck is a Python based CLI so it should work on any system. \n\nYou can install it on MacOS via Homebrew with:\n\n    brew tap amperity/chuck-data\n    brew install chuck-data\n\nVia Python you can install it with pip with:\n\n    pip install chuck-data\n\nHere are links for more information:\n\n* Git repo: [https://github.com/amperity/chuck-data](https://github.com/amperity/chuck-data)\n* Website: [https://chuckdata.ai](https://chuckdata.ai)\n* Launch video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3BBaLPYukA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3BBaLPYukA) \n* Discord: [https://discord.gg/f3UZwyuQqe](https://discord.gg/f3UZwyuQqe)\n\nIf you would prefer to try it out on fake data first, we have a wide variety of fake data sets in the Databricks marketplace. You'll want to copy it into your own Catalog since you can't write into Delta Shares.  [https://marketplace.databricks.com/?searchKey=amperity&sortBy=popularity](https://marketplace.databricks.com/?searchKey=amperity&sortBy=popularity)\n\nI would recommend [the datasets in the \"bronze\" schema for this one specifically](https://marketplace.databricks.com/details/6bc4843f-3809-4995-8461-9756f6164ddf/Amperity_Amperitys-Identity-Resolution-Agent-30-Day-Trial).\n\n  \nThanks for reading and any feedback is welcome!",

        "title": "Confused about the direction and future of my career as a data engineer",
        "author": "thro0away12",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm somebody who worked as a data analyst, data scientist and now data engineer. I guess my role is more of an analytics engineering role, but the more I've worked in my role, it seems the future direction is to make my role completely non-technical, which is the opposite of what I was hoping for when I got hired. In my past jobs, I thrived when I was developing technical solutions in my work. I wanted to be a SWE but leap from analytics to SWE was difficult without more engineering experience, which is how I landed my role. \n\nWhen I was hired for my role, my understanding was that my job would be that I have at least 70% of the requirements fleshed out and will be building the solution either via Python, SQL or whatever tool. Instead, here's what's happening:\n\n* I get looped into a project with zero context and zero documentation as to what the project is\n* I quite frankly have no idea or any direction with what I'm supposed to do and what the end result is supposed to be used for or what it should look like\n* My way of building things is to use past 'similar projects', navigate endless PDF documents, emails, tickets to figure out what I should be doing\n* I code out a half-baked solution using these resources\n* I get feedback that the old similar project solution doesn't work, that I had to go into a very specific subfolder and refer to a documentation there to figure out something \n* My half-baked idea either has to revert back to completely starting from scratch or progressively starts to bake but is never fully baked \n* Now multiply this by 4, plus meetings and other tasks, so no time for even me to write documentation. \n* Lots of time, energy gets wasted in this. My 8 hour days have started becoming 12. I'm sleeping as late as 2-3 AM sometimes. I'm noticing my brain slowing down and a lack of interest in my work. but I'm still working as best as I can. I have zero time to upskill. I want to take a certification exam this year, but I'm frequently too burnt out to study. I also don't know if my team will really support me in wanting to get certs or work towards new technical skills. \n* On top of all of this, I have one colleague who constantly has a gripe about my work - that it's not being done faster. When I ask for clarification, he doesn't properly provide it. He constantly makes me feel uncomfortable to speak b/c he will say 'I'm frustrated', 'I wanted this to be done faster', 'this is concerning'. Instead of constructive feedback, he vents about me to my boss and their boss. \n\nI feel like the team I work on is very much a firm believer that AI will eventually phase out traditional SWE and DE jobs as we know today and the focus should be on the aspects AI can't replace, such as us coming up with ways to translate stakeholder needs into something useful. In theory, I understand the rationale, in practice....I just feel translation aspect will always be midly frustrating with all the uncertainties and constant changes around what people want. I don't know about the future though, whether or not trying to upskill, learn a new language or get a cert is worth my time or energy if there won't be money or jobs here. I can say thugh those aspects of DE are what I enjoy the most and why I wanted to become a data engineer. In an ideal world, my job would be a compromise between what I like and what will help me have a job/make money. \n\nI'm not sure what to do. Should I just stay in my role and evolve as an eventual business analyst or product manager or work towards something else? I'm even open to considering something outside of DE like MLE, SWE or maybe product management if it has some technical aspects to it. ",

        "author": "the_aero_guy",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I am an junior data engineer and I have recently started in a project here at my company. Although it is not a critical project, it is a very good one to improve my abilities in data modeling. So when I dove into it, I have got some questions. My main difficulty here is *how to and what to start thinking of when modeling the data from the original relational model to a start schema data model where it can be used by the dataViz people in PowerBI*.\n\nBelow is a *very* simplified table relationship that I built to illustrate how the source tables are structured.\n\n[Original relational model](https://preview.redd.it/htaxxfp5o38f1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb45d6238590975b76a78cb3676fa2e8089211b3)\n\n*Quick explanation of the original architecture:*\n\nHere, it is a *sort* of snowflake architecture, where the main table is clearly Table A, which stores the main reports (type A). There are also a bunch of tables B's which are from the same type of report (type B) with some columns in common (as seen in the print) but each table has some exclusive columns, which depends of the report the user want to fill (TableB\\_a may have some type of infos that do not need to be filled in TableB\\_d, and so on).\n\nSo for example, when a user creates a main report in TableA in the app interface, they can choose if they will fill any type B report and, if so, which reports of type B they will fill. There must be a type A report and each one of them can have 0 or many type B reports.\n\nEach type B tables can have another two tables:\n\n* one for the participants assigned to the type B report\n* and other to the pictures attached to each of the type B report.\n\nThere are also many other tables seen in the left side of the picture that connects to TableA (such as Activities and tableA\\_docs) and user related tables, like Users, UserCertificate and Groups. Users, specially, connects to almost every other table by the column CreatedBy.\n\n*My question:*\n\nI need to create the new data modeling that will me used in PBI and to do so I will use views (there is not a lot of data, so the performance will not be affected). I actually do not know how to start and which steps I can take to start the modeling. But I have an idea:\n\nI was thinking about using star schema where I will have 2 fact tables (FT\\_TABLE\\_A and FT\\_TABLE\\_B) and some dimension tables around them. For FT\\_TABLEA I may use TableA directly. For FT\\_TABLE\\_B, I was thinking of joining each trio of tables (TableB\\_x - TableB\\_x\\_pics - TableB\\_x\\_participants) and then union them all using the common columns between then. The exclusive columns may be kept to be consulted directly in the original tables since for the dashboard their data is not important).\n\nFor the dimensions, I think i can join Users, Groups and UserCertificate to create DM\\_USERS, for example. The other tables can be used as dimensions directly.\n\nTo link the fact tables between themselves, I can create a DM\\_TA\\_TB, where it will stores the IDs from tables b and the ids from table A (like a hash map).\n\nSo is my approach correct? Did I start well? I really want to understand **which approach I can take** in this kind of project and **how to think** here. I also want to know great references to study (with practical examples, please).\n\nI also do not master some concepts, so I am open to suggestions and corrections.\n\nEDIT: \n\nHere are some of the metrics I need to show:\n\n\\* the status of the reports of Type A and B's (are they open? are they closed?) for each location (lat long data is in TableA and the status is in each TableB) and the map plot to show where each report where filled (independently of the B type of the report)\n\n\\* The distribution plot for the level of criticality: how many B reports for each level (10 for low level, 3 for mid level and 4 for high level) (this will be calculated using the data from the reports)\n\n\\* alerts for activities that are next to deadline (the date info is in TableB)\n\n\\* How many type A and Type B reports are given to each group (and what are their status).\n\n\\* How the Type B are distributed between the groups (for example, Group 1 have more activities related to maintenance while Group 2 are doing more investigations activies)\n\nAnd etc. There are other metrics but these are the main ones\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "author": "Peppers_16",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "  \n**TL;DR:** Metrics look wrong (e.g. bot traffic), analysts estimate what they *should* be (e.g. “reduce Brazil visits by 20%”), and we apply that adjustment inside the DAG. Now upstream changes break those adjustments. Feels like a feedback loop in what should be a one-way pipeline. Is this ever OK?\n\n# Setup:\n\nGo easy on me — this is a setup I’ve inherited, and I’m trying to figure out whether there's a cleaner or more robust way of doing things.\n\nOur data pipeline looks roughly like this:\n\n**Raw clickstream events**  \n⬇️  \n***Visit-level data*** — one row per user \"visit\", with attributes like country and OS (each visit can have many clicks)  \n⬇️  \n***Semi-aggregated visit metrics*** — e.g., on a given day, `Brazil`, `Android` had `n` visits  \n⬇️  \n**Consumed** in BI dashboards and by commercial analysts\n\nHopefully nothing controversial so far.\n\nHere’s the wrinkle:  \nSometimes, analysts spot issues in the historical metrics. E.g., they might conclude that bot traffic inflated `Brazil/Android` visit counts for a specific date range. But they can’t pinpoint the individual \"bad\" visits. So instead, they estimate what the metric *should* have been and calculate a scalar adjustment (like x0.8) at the aggregate level.\n\nThese adjustment factors are then applied **in the pipeline** — i.e. post-aggregation, we multiply `n` by the analyst-provided factor. So the new pipeline effectively looks like:\n\nRaw clickstream  \n⬇️  \nVisit-level data  \n⬇️  \nSemi-aggregated visit metrics  \n⬇️  \n**Apply scalar adjustments** to those metrics  \n⬇️  \nDashboards\n\nAnalysts are happy: dashboards aren't showing janky year-on-year comparisons etc. \n\n# Why this smells:\n\nBasically, this works until some change has to be re-calculated on past data. \n\nEvery time we make improvements upstream — e.g. reclassify visits based on better geo detection — it changes the distribution of the original aggregates. So suddenly the old adjustment (e.g., “reduce Brazil visits on 2024-01-02 by 20%”) no longer applies cleanly, because maybe some of those Brazil visits are now Mexico.\n\nThat means **the Data Engineering team has to halt and go back to the analysts** to get the adjustments recalculated. And often, those folks are overloaded. It creates a deadlock, basically.\n\nTo me, this feels like a kind of *feedback loop* snuck into a system that’s supposed to be a DAG. We’ve taken output metrics, made judgment-based adjustments, and then re-inserted them *into* the DAG as if they were part of the deterministic flow. That works — until you need to backfill or reprocess.\n\n# My question:\n\nThis feels messy. But I also understand why it was done — when a spike looks obviously wrong, business users don’t want to report it as-is. They want a dashboard that reflects their best estimate of reality.\n\nStill… has anyone found a more sustainable or principled way to handle this kind of post-hoc adjustment? Especially one that doesn’t jam up the pipeline every time upstream logic changes?\n\nThanks in advance for any ideas — or even war stories.",

I want to build something that helps rock climbers better plan their outdoor trips by allowing them to compare locations(s) with each other and with weather data.\n\nHowever, I am at a crossroads.\n\nI can either use Streamlit, a very simple and basic web framework which requires only Python. I've seen examples of websites built on Streamlit and they look okay. They're more prototypes than anything else and seem more geared to data science. However, the time investment looks minimal.\n\nOn the other hand I can invest time learning HTML, CSS and Flask. This is will create a far more professional looking website that would look better on my CV but the time invested in these tools might be better used for actual DE tools like Spark, NoSQL, Kafka etc. I am passionate about data and I like building pipelines and I really don't have any interest in frontend.\n\nBut on the other other hand, what's the likelihood that I need to learn Spark, NoSql, Kafka? People on this sub harp on about how DE is not an entry-level role anyways so would it branching out be more beneficial for someone who's just getting started? Also do employers even look at personal projects?\n\nOn the other other hand, am I just overthinking this and is my ADHD making it hard for me to make a final decision?\n\nThoughts please!",

        "content": "**Hello everyone,**\n\nI hope you're all doing well.\n\nI'm reaching out here to ask for some guidance or suggestions as I continue my job search in the data engineering field.\n\nLet me introduce myself briefly. I began my career in 2017 as a junior data engineer and worked in India for 5 years. During that time, I gained solid experience with technologies such as Spark, Airflow, AWS, CI/CD, Kafka, Elasticsearch, SQL, Python, Scala, and a bit of GCP. These form the core of my technical background.\n\nAfter working with two companies in India, I moved to the UK in mid-2022 to pursue a Master’s degree in Data Science. It was a one-year program, and I graduated in 2023 with distinction. Right after graduation, I worked as a Machine Learning Research Assistant in the UK until February 2025. Around that time, I moved to Ireland on a joint visa, and I'm currently settled here.\n\nSince March 2025, I've been actively looking for opportunities in data engineering or software development. I’ve been fortunate to receive interviews from some great companies. I’ll admit, I wasn’t fully prepared for the first two or three, but since then, I’ve put in a lot of focused effort. I'm now quite confident in SQL, Python, and problem-solving.\n\nHowever, it’s now June, and I still haven’t landed a role. I’ve reached the final rounds in 3 or 4 interviews, but unfortunately, the outcomes have been negative. This has been difficult emotionally, and I'm growing concerned about the employment gap it’s creating in my career.\n\nI can feel the competition is intense, especially in the data engineering field. Some people are even surprised that I haven’t secured a role yet, given my 5+ years of experience and a master’s degree. I understand their perspective, but I’m truly doing everything I can.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, guidance, or even just words of encouragement, I would deeply appreciate it. If you were in my position, what would you do? I’m starting to feel like my career is slipping away, and any support would mean a lot to me right now.\n\nThank you so much in advance.",

        "content": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI'm wondering if someone here can help me piece something together. In my job, I think I have reached the boundary between data engineering and data science, and I'm out of my depth right now.\n\nI work for a government contractor. I am the only data scientist on the team and was recently hired. It's government work, so it's inherently a little slow and we don't necessarily have the newest tools. Since they have not hired a data scientist before, I currently have more infrastructure-related tasks. I also don't have a ton of people that I can get help from - I might need to reach out to somebody on a totally different contract if I wanted some insight/mentorship on this, which wouldn't be impossible, but I figured that posting here might get me more breadth.\n\nVaguely, there is an abundance of data that is (mostly) stored on Oracle databases. One smaller subset of it is stored on an ElasticSearch cluster. It's an enormous amount that goes back 15 years. It has been slow for me to get access to the Oracle database and ElasticSearch cluster, just because they've never had to give someone access before that wasn't already a database admin.\n\nI am very fortunate that the data (1) exists and (2) exists in a way that would actually be useful for building a model, which is what I have primarily been hired to do. Now that I have access to these databases, I've been trying to find the best way to work with the data. I've been trying to move toward storing it in parquet files, but today, I was thinking, \"this feels really weird that all these parquet files would just exist locally for me.\" Some Googling later, I encountered this concept of a \"data lake.\"\n\nI'm posting here largely because I'm hopeful to understand how this process works in industry - I definitely didn't learn this in school! I've been having this nagging feeling that \"something is missing\" - like there should be something in between the database and any analysis/EDA that I'm doing in Python. This is because queries are slow, it doesn't feel scalable for me to locally store a bunch of parquet files, and there is just no single, versioned source of \"truth.\"\n\nIs a data lake (or lakehouse?) what is typically used in this situation?",

But when I check the path its meant to be writing into, its empty. as I create a table, an empty folder with table name and uuid is created, but no data/metadata inside. Most likely it is being cached somewhere, because if i reboot the trino server (and not restart trino, bcz that does not change it), the message says: \n\nQuery <id> failed: Metadata not found in metadata location for table <table\\_name>\n\nbut cant create same table before I drop current one. BTW, dropping the table is also success, but does not remove the folder from the original storage. (the empty folder it creates)\n\nPlease help me, I'm about to burn this place down and migrate to different country.",

However, I've recently started trying to make stuff for Android and for the web, and **dear lord it's soo much more complicated**.\n\nThe main problem i have, specially when making Android apps, is that a minimal \"hello world\" example is very complex. I got used to starting with literally 1 file (main.c / cpp), 1 command (the compiler doing its thing), and 1 resulting file (the binary).\n\nWith Android, a minimal working example has dozens of files, a dozen processes running in the background, a dozen dependencies being downloaded while building, and even if you do everything right, sometimes a bug in one of those hundreds of failure points just breaks everything.\n\nA similar situation happens with webdev, though an **actual** minimal project only requires HTML, with most of the complexity existing on the server setup.\n\nI know this sounds like a rant, so here's the actual question: Is there a good reason for this, or is it just a case of an environment evolving badly over time?",

What would you recommend?\n\nI struggle with keeping myself motivated when it comes to learning theory, but when I'm in an environment that is more structured, with tests and deadlines I'm better at following through, so I've been thinking of enlisting in a couple of classes at my local community college, however as those tend to be pretty expensive, I would like to hear any alternatives you might have.\n\nThank you all!",

You didn’t have to memorize everything to actually do math in real life.\n\nThat’s kind of where my question about coding comes in. Back in the day, it seemed like you needed to know more off the top of your head so you weren’t constantly stopping to look things up, which could slow you down. But with AI tools now, where you can have help writing code and explanations, is it different?\n\nHow much of actual programming do you really need to memorize these days? Is it enough to just understand what’s happening at a high level, to know what you’re trying to do and why it works, and just look up the details as you go? Or is it still important to know all the algorithms, data structures, and other fundamentals in order to really be a programmer and write solid code?\n\nI guess I’m trying to compare it to math class, where it felt like they acted as if you’d never be allowed to use a calculator or look something up, when in reality you could. So I’m asking any professional programmers out there: Do you just know a lot of this stuff naturally because you’ve been doing it for so long, or do you think it’s still essential to learn and really know certain core things, with everything else being okay to look up as needed?\n\n",

My lecturers were software engineers at top companies and gave so much valuable advice and insight into what it’s actually like working as a software engineer. But whilst learning, they said it’s not important for us to know and fully understand everything, it’s just about us knowing that these things exist and so when we would get the job, we aren’t unfamiliar with certain tech vocab and we can just search it up in the job. \n\nSo right now I’m about to start React with TOP. But in the back of my mind I know that when it came to the async topics for eg, I didn’t fully understand it and it’s just in the back of my mind.  \nI’d typically just make sure I’m somewhat familiar with it and then just move on. I’ve read the docs but don’t fully get it. I don’t know if me wanting to fully 100% get it is my perfectionist side and therefore perhaps slightly pointless when considering the advice my lecturers gave, or if me having a decent grasp on it is a enough and now I can just move on. \n\nI’d really appreciate hearing people’s opinion on this :)\n\n",

        "content": "I see a lot of posts, particularly from people trying to learn about the dangers of AI. I think it's very easy to misuse it but there are a few simple things we can all do to keep ourselves growing. The issue with AI is that it's answers are too easy so they don't \"stick\" in your mind.\n\n1) Never copy and paste code. This applies to tutorials as well. The act of typing will help you remember. Pair this with consciously thinking about everything you type and scrolling through IDE intellisense suggestions.\n\n2) Always ask for an explanation. Even for simple things, just reading the explanation can help your brain.\n\n3) Get familiar with documentation. AI can spit out an answer, but it isn't necessarily giving you the best answer. Looking at docs (if they are good) will show you different ways of using certain features or components. Alternatively, ask AI for different options and explanations of what works best in what situations.\n\n4) Ask about design patterns and Strategies rather than specific code snippets. This has helped me a ton. It's easy to find an article about why x is better than y, but the reality is most of the time each strategy fits a different requirement better and sometimes it's about how you want to build your system. \n\n5) if you don't need AI, don't use it. Even if it takes you a little longer to do something, forcing your brain to recall something will signal to your brain that that information is important and we should keep it. If you overly rely on AI, your brain will stop retaining the information. The same thing happens in a relationship. If your partner is responsible for feeding the pets, it's hard for you to remember. That is shared memory and it happens with AI.",

It’s been a steady job, but I’ve hit a point where I really want to progress, earn a better salary, and feel like I’m actually growing in my career. The problem is — I feel completely stuck and unsure of the right direction to take.\n\nI dabbled in web development years ago (HTML, CSS, a bit of jQuery) and had a couple of jobs back in the 2010-12s, but tech has moved on so much since then. Now I’m looking at everything from JavaScript frameworks like React, to modern build tools, version control, APIs, and responsive design — and honestly, it feels like a huge mountain to climb. I worry I’ve left it too late.\n\nPart of me thinks I should go down the cloud or cybersecurity route instead. I’ve passed the AZ-900 and looked into cloud engineering, but I only know the networking basics and don’t feel that confident with scripting or using the CLI. AWS also seems like a potential direction, but I’m just not sure where I’d thrive.\n\nTo complicate things, I suspect I have undiagnosed ADHD. I’ve always struggled with focus, information retention, and consistency when learning. It’s only recently I’ve realized how much that could be holding me back — and making this decision even harder.\n\nWhat triggered all this is seeing someone I used to work with — he’s now a successful cyber engineer in his 20s. It hit me hard. I know it’s not healthy to compare, but I can’t help feeling like I’ve missed the boat.\n\nI’m torn:\n\t•\tIs web dev too layered and overwhelming to break into now?\n\n\t•\tCan someone like me still make a comeback and get hired in this field?\n\n\t•\tOr should I pivot to something more structured like cloud or cyber, where maybe the learning path is clearer?\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice from those who’ve been through a similar fork in the road — especially if you’ve changed paths later in life or dealt with ADHD while trying to upskill.\n\nThanks for reading. Really appreciate any thoughts.\n",

        "content": "Hi everyone. I'm a 17 year old student from Argentina, currently preparing to study Computer Science at university next year. Lately, I've been diving into low-level programming out of genuine interest. Things like operating systems, compilers, and so on.\n\nI’ve read many times that there's a shortage of young developers in these areas, especially compared to the overwhelming number of people going into web development. That sounds like an opportunity, but I don't really see a lot of job listings for low-level roles. Not as visible or as frequent as web/backend openings.\n\nSo, I’m wondering:\n\n* Is low-level programming still a viable and a realistic path?\n* How do people usually find jobs in this space? Are they mostly through networking, open source contributions, or something else?\n* Are remote jobs in this field even common, or is being in certain countries a must?\n* How realistic is it to break into this field from Argentina or Latin America in general?\n\nI’m not against going the backend route (which I don't like in any way), but I really enjoy low-level stuff and would love to keep that door open — ideally both as a career and as a serious hobby.\n\nAny guidance, stories, or pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

        "content": "I’ve been working as a software dev for around 5 months. Things are generally going well, my work gets done, and I’ve handled some fairly complex features according to my tech lead. I’ve also worked with pen testers, supported QA, and regularly get asked questions about one of our key new features.\n\nHowever, my confidence keeps taking hits. For example, I recently upgraded our Node containers to Node 22 and updated some code using new JS features. But the cloud builder was still on Node 18, and tests failed. A mid-level dev suggested I talk to DevOps since they own the cloud builder and can proparly upgrade it quite easy, which I did, and I submitted my PRs. The next day, my tech lead upgraded the cloud builders himself and told me that I could’ve done it myself, and explained how to do it.\n\nSomething similar happened a couple of months ago, and I promised to flag such situations earlier, but now I just feel dumb again. These moments hit me hard and make me second-guess myself, even though I’m trying to learn, ask questions, and be proactive.\n\nMy tech lead and manager have both said I’m doing well, and that I should start doing my own features (which I’ve started planning), but when I make mistakes like this, I feel like I am shit.\n\nI know this is likely coming from me more than anyone else, but it doesn’t make it any easier.\n\nHas anyone else felt this way early in their career? How did you deal with it?",

Also, is it better to keep digital notes or go old-school with pen and paper (I don't have prior experience of making digital notes but I need to learn)?\n5. How does submission of problem sets and projects work?\n6. Are there any specific tools or software I need to install beforehand?\n7. How does the free certificate process work?

However, to me, what they call \"opinion-based\" questions are the most interesting type of questions and they tackle the problem of possible ways of solving something.\n\nI'm a newbie programmer. I'm developing a C# program. My program has a Configuration class, where I basically need only 1 instance of the object for an entire run of the program, which tells me the class could be designed as a Singleton. However, there is a twist. My program is able to do calculations. A calculation takes some while to complete. My program can only do 1 calculation at a time, but it is possible to set multiple calculations in a queue. A calculation requires the Configuration. When I set a calculation in a queue, I want to take a \"snapshot\" of the state of the Configuration at the specific time, therefore create some sort of a copy of the Configuration. Now my question is - does this go against the Singleton principle? \n\nPlease be lenient with me. As I say, I'm a newbie, not a C# world champion, so some constructive points would really help me.

Incluso he pensado que, si en algún punto quisiera volver al frontend, podría aprender Angular, que parece tener más presencia en empresas medianas y grandes.\n\nMe gustaría escuchar sus opiniones:\n\n* ¿Creen que tiene sentido posicionarse como **backend developer** desde el inicio?\n* ¿Vale la pena explorar Java/Spring o algun otro?\n* ¿O es mejor pulir mis habilidades en JS fullstack y simplemente destacar más por calidad que por tecnología?\n\nAgradezco cualquier consejo, experiencia o enfoque que puedan darme 🙏",

        "content": "Working on an early-startup and while we have been developing fast, my startup co-founder's vibe coding almost broke our product multiple times. We're at the point where we have a few thousands of users, so we can't just mindlessly push to main.\n\nBut here's an example. Was implementing a rating system the other day for our product where users could essentially rate a piece of content and I had implemented it in a way such that database queries and writes are efficient. I implement the rating system, it's working, and then hand it off to my co-founder to improve the UI as they like. Next thing I know, my co-founder said they noticed a bug and said they fixed it, and I pull their changes. I'm shocked to find that some of the loading times for the sections where ratings are being fetched are extremely slow, which confuses me, as I checked that querying should be quick earlier.\n\nI asked my co-founder what was the bug they found earlier. They said they were noticing when a user updated a rating on one page and then navigated to another page, the rating wasn't updated. They thought it was some caching issue (not really understanding how our current caching works since rating data wasn't even be cached on the client) and decided to input the entire section into Claude and ask to fix it and then copy and paste. Claude spitted out a new section that fetched the data in an extremely inefficient way causing the slow load times.\n\nI look into the code for about 10-15 minutes. I realized the error didn't have to do with the database or caching at all, but simply because co-founder (or Claude I guess) added different rendering logic on the UI for showing the ratings in one section compared to an other section (so the ratings were being properly updated under the hood but appeared to not be consistent because of UI inconsistencies). After I push the fix, I'm just thinking, yes this was relatively small, but I just lost over 10 minutes fixing something that wouldn't have been an issue with basic software engineering principles (re-using existing code / simple refactoring). Imagine if we were still just pushing to prod.\n\nThere's another story I could tell here, but this post is already getting long (tldr is co-founder tried to vibe code a small change and then f'd up one of our features just before launch which I luckily noticed on the deployment preview).\n\nSo, when people say \"AI is going to replace software engineers\", I have to laugh. Even on something that people (wrongly) think is simple like frontend, the models are often crapping out across the board when you look at [benchmarks](https://www.designarena.ai/). I also remembering watching videos and reading articles on products like Devin AI failing over 50% of real-world SWE tasks. Don't be fooled by the AI hype. Yes, it will increase productively and change the role and responsibilities of a SWE, but a non-technical PM or manager isn't just going to be able to create something on a corporate scale.",

Without much context or follow-up, the email stated:\n\n**“Please complete no later than 3 days from the time of this email.”**\n\nIt didn’t matter when I saw the message or what I had going on--they expected urgency and precision on my end. It was already late in the recruiting season, but since they were a YC startup, I decided to give it a shot. I put in \\~30 hours of focused work. They asked for a full-stack AI copilot that integrates with Google Drive, retrieves relevant snippets, and could be tested by their team, which is an insane task to do in 3 days imo. I still attempted to build it, recorded a video walkthrough, sent them a GitHub invite as requested, and submitted it all on time.\n\nNo response. Not after 3 days. Not after 7. They didn’t even accept the GitHub invite.  \n\nIt’s disappointing--especially when they pushed for urgency and responsiveness, but couldn’t extend even basic courtesy in return. I feel like I wasted so much time. I wouldn’t be nearly as frustrated if they had just ignored my application from the start. What stings is that they did respond, assigned an extremely demanding task, and then completely disappeared. Even a simple rejection email would've been good.\n\nBehind every resume is a real person with real commitments. I was proud of what I built, and getting ghosted like this felt incredibly disrespectful. Venting to the people around me helped but they also couldn't believe that the company would simply choose not to respond. I guess I moved on now but just sharing this in case others have had similar experiences or know what to do.",

        "content": "Now to start, I will say AI is a fantastic tool. It makes development cycles much much faster. Things that I thought would originally take weeks now take days. That said, the more and more I am using AI for coding, my initial awe at the technology continues to wear off, and now claims that coding will be dead or SWE will go extinct seem far-fetched or overly optimistic at best.\n\nAfter working on some stuff for the past few months, for the initial MVP or demo or prototype, I was always able to spin up something decent with AI. However, when I would create stuff even on the scale of just a few hundred or few thousands of users, I would notice that things would start to break down, and AI actually missed a lot of things during development such as:\n\n  \n1. Performance Optimization: AI won't immediately implement stuff like caching systems, pagination, and database design optimization or indexing without explicitly being told. Let's take caching for example. I wanted to cache results on a page to speed up load times and reduce unnecessary queries to the database. I gave the AI a file for a page to implement caching for and it did it, but then I realized that there was a design flaw that didn't lead to the best UX (when user is performing mutation actions, it seems like the page wasn't being updated until the cache expired so I should clear or update the cache on those actions). Now this may seem like something trivial to a developer, but I doubt a non-technical person using AI would be able to catch these details, know what files to edit, and spin up something fully optimized. Tldr here is that if I just pretty much let AI create my whole app for me, I would end up with something incredibly non-optimized, slow, and would have poor user experience for a larger audience. \n\n2. UI/UX: A lot of people think that frontend will be the first to go. Yes, AI can currently basically zero/one-shot landing pages and basic crud apps. But when these apps need to scale to at least hundreds of thousands of people, and stuff like device responsiveness and accessibility or other UI/UX features becomes important, AI is not giving you solutions out-of-the-box unless it's guided. I came across this [UI/UX benchmark](https://www.designarena.ai) to compare different models, and models today do struggle at really creating production/professional sites, though vibe coding might suffice for a marketing site or hobby app.   \n  \nThose are a few things I noticed, but there are even more things that I mentioned such as infrastructure and systems design, security, etc. that AI isn't getting right yet on its own, and I would be surprised if a person with little-to-no programming experience could ensure are implemented correctly. \n\nNow of course, what exactly software engineers do will change (and it already has), but I still think SWEs will still need to serve as an \"architect\" for the AI while the AI takes the role of the \"construction worker\" or \"builder\". We have seen what happens when we allow bad architects to design buildings and infrastructure (people lose their lives). The same should probably apply to who we have use AI to design crucial systems.   \n  \n ",

Stuff like Loveable or v0 are cool for making UI that you can build off of, but don't really feel all that different from using Wix or Squarespace or Framer, which yes people will use for a simple marketing site, but not an actual application that has complexity.\n\nOutside of just using AI to speed up searching or writing code, has anyone really found it to be capable of creating something that can be put in production and used by hundreds of thousands of users with little guidance from a human, or at least guidance from someone with little to no technical experience?\n\nI personally have not seen it, but who knows could be copium.",

Anyways soon after the SVP of my group within the company approached a coworker on a team I work closely with. His request was that a secret dashboard that only he (SVP) would have access to, so that he could continue monitoring those under him. It would be built by pulling all the logs we already collect on all of our network. \n\nThis would be significantly more detailed than sapience is, and while we do already collect all of these logs, I think this is creepy behavior. \n\nAs an example of why I think this is creepy is that when I do investigations I have the access to see every email sent/received, site visited, file accessed/run and lots more on an individual machine. However, if I were just looking into these things without reason I would expect to be fired. \n\nIdk what to do, if there is anything I can do ",

The city I live in is a tech hub so its not like I live in the middle of nowhere. \n\nI had a recruiter message me about a meta contract job around $200k, but that got put on hold by Meta for undisclosed reasons. I had another fang type job do the same. Another recruiter ghosted me after they reached out lol. And thats about it. \n\nIve applied for 1,000+ jobs at this point in soft eng, product management, devops, and eng manager roles. I dont have any connections left that can help. I messaged people I know working at Google, Amazon, etc. \n\nI regret doing CS. I had expectations when I started CS that this point in my career I could find a new job quickly. Even for $40k a year jobs which Im not even getting responses for. \n\nI did premed in my ugrad(chem bio ochem etc. on top of CS) Im confident I can apply and be accepted. Carribean MD is the fallback. \n\nMany complain about how doctors go to school for so long and make so little, but I went to school for just as long(my masters thesis took a while) and I had a 3 year \"residency\" first job for $60k a year, I broke six figures post covid and at this point Im making $0.

Now they want me to fill out fields like “How many years of experience in React do you have” or the same with NoSQL or database. \n\nTypically I am inclined to answer honestly. However I feel that these fields are often just auto filters that will punish you hard for lying and you’ll never have a person even glance at your resume. \n\nSo if I have 5 years of experience in Angular and SQLServer, do I just say “ah close enough i’ll learn that in a week” and claim I’ve worked for 5 years with react and django ",

        "content": "So, 10 months ago I made this post:\n\n[How do I get my first job as a self-taught software developer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1evuuo5/how_do_i_get_my_first_job_as_a_selftaught/)\n\nAt the time, I was beyond frustrated. I had nearly two decades of experience building all kinds of things. From game engines to low-level graphics to machine learning, but no degree, no big-name companies on my resume, and most of my freelance work was under NDA, so I couldn’t even show it off publicly. Since then, I learned to approach things differently: I started using platforms like LinkedIn more actively, did a bit of networking, and made a point of showing off my skillset.\n\nThe post got downvoted pretty heavily. A lot of people didn’t like how I phrased things or maybe didn’t believe someone in my situation could be skilled.  \nWhatever the reason, I got the message: *“You’re not supposed to complain. Just stay in your lane.”*\n\n***But here’s the update:*** I landed a job as an Embedded Software Engineer.\n\nOver the summer, I was approached by three companies. What changed was how I presented myself. I started using LinkedIn actively, and Premium honestly helped me get visibility. On top of that, I shared more of my personal projects and made my skills visible.\n\nOne company I haven’t heard back from yet. For another, the recruiter told me the position was put on hold but asked if they could reach out again when hiring resumed. For the third, I made it deeper into the interview stages.\n\nI was told there were other applicants, most of whom had degrees, but I still ended up getting the offer at the top of the pay range they advertised. The role is Embedded Software Engineer, and honestly it’s a higher-level position than I expected to land right out the gate, but one I’m confident stepping into.\n\nWhat helped most was having solid personal projects to point to. During the technical interview, I didn’t have any trouble with the questions, and the team lead seemed to get a good impression of me fairly quickly.\n\nIf you’re self-taught and don’t have a degree, the most useful advice I can give is to make your work visible. Start publishing your projects on GitHub, put together a simple portfolio website, and make sure you’re using LinkedIn. If you’re able to afford Premium, it was surprisingly helpful during my job search and the only reason I used it was because they gave me a free trial.\n\nWhat really got the process moving was a recruiter reaching out based on the broad strokes of my resume. Once someone technical took a closer look at what I’d done, things moved quickly from there.\n\n\n\nI do want to ask though: \n\nWhy did it seem like people hated my original post so much? I can guess and make inferrences, but I would like to know. It was sort of discouraging and I did shift my focus for a little while as a result, but things went really differently on this last hunt just from some strategic changes.",

I can do the work, but the amount of hours I have to put in to keep up with the workload is wearing on me mentally and physically. I have also spent nearly 1/4th of the past 4 years actively on call. I am sick of being on house arrest every 3-4 weeks for a week at a time.\n\nMy work life balance was amazing during my time in defense, plus the 4/10 and 9/80 schedules were great. I have been trying to get back to defense but the fact my clearance expired since switching to tech has made that very difficult. All the open positions require an active TS/SCI and mine expired nearly two years ago. Have not found a position willing to sponsor yet.\n\nI am ultimately looking for something that I can just put in my 40 hours a week an call it a day with no on-call. Not really worried about the pay cut that will entail.\n\nI know government in general is good for that, but with the current administration not really optimistic about getting a gov job.\n\nWhat are some good industries that would provide a similar level of WLB to defense?",

        "author": "Flat-Butterfly8907",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I am a ~~Senior~~ Backend Engineer who has never made it past Junior. I got fucked over by two jobs in a row over the past 4 years which held me back. Its a long story so I'll try to keep it somewhat short (because oh boy there is so much more I could talk about).\n\nThe first one was one I held for 3 years. The company was tumultuous and there was high turn over, and a year into the job, half of the engineers were gone and replaced, and by year 3, I was the longest tenure engineer at the company. When I first started there, we had no titles besides Software Engineer and Senior Software Engineer. 2 years in, they decided they wanted to be more like other companies and decided to implement bands. At this point, I was doing system design, db design, security, re-architecture work, introducing process changes, leading meetings, mentoring, etc. I was pushing to get a promotion, because I was doing way more senior work than other seniors in the company, but I was told that they were making a rubric and had frozen promotions for 6 months.\n\nSo, 6 months go by and we have this new salary/title band system, and we get a new HR system as well. I don't think too much of it until one day I go to submit some time off, and under my profile name, it says \"Software Engineer I\", the lowest title level. I'm stunned and go look at the org chart and out of 40 engineers, I am the ONLY ONE who is a Software Engineer I. I bring it up to the engineering manager and he tells me to just go through the review process and it should be fixed with the new rubric. So review time comes around and I finally get the rubric that I had been asking for for a month, and the new rubric ends up blocking my promotion.\n\nWhy? Because whoever made the rubric decided one of the requirements to go from Engineer I to Engineer II is that you have \"Taken responsibility when your changes were responsible for a critical error\". Problem is, after 2.5 years, I never introduced a show-stopping bug. I was the only engineer in the company who never introduced a show-stopping bug. So apparently, I failed that requirement, so they weren't going to give me a promotion. I ended up getting laid off with a bunch of other people 6 months after.\n\nThen last year, I started working a job that was supposed to be a Senior Engineer position, but even though I did great on the interviews, because my previous position wasn't as a \"Senior\", they wouldn't give me the senior title. At this point, things were starting to get pretty bad with the job market and I was desperate, so I took it. Ended up getting laid off again with people late last year.\n\nNow, with how bad the market has gotten, I am struggling to get any traction. I am one of those devs who truly loves writing software, and I've loved it since I first tried it out in high school just for fun. I'm not the most genius engineer or anything like that, but I truly love it, and its not about the money for me. But these past 4 years have really killed my drive and motivation. Now here I am, barely getting any traction while job-searching for months, and since every job posting out there is for Senior+, I'm getting filtered out of jobs left and right. At this point, should I just \"lie\" (or rather, correct what titles I should have had)?",

These past few months I have been going through the rounds for interviews and recently had one for a mid level role in JPMC. I basically talked to the recruiter for JPMC and then was scheduled for a 1.5 hour interview with the hiring team.\n\nThe interview basically involved grilling me on my resume, quite a few questions regarding programming concepts/tidbits, and finally a small coding exercise. While I did alright on the interview, I would not say that I was outstanding. I definitely fumbled answering some questions regarding Spring and a some other things. Yet that week, I received a call saying they were impressed and wanted to offer me a position.\n\nI am curious as to why I received an offer that fast, especially since I believe my performance during the questioning phase of the interview was not that impressive. Are they just trying to fill in the role or is there something else I should be concerned about? If anyone has any incites to share regarding this, or thoughts, I would greatly appreciate it!",

My manager is a in whole different city and apparently nothing was planned for me. I ended doing nothing that day besides getting my computer. I personally reached out to the manager and he said he would call me but didn’t on the first day.\n\n2nd day, I had absolutely nothing planned on my calendar. I had no idea what I was supposed to do, who to talk to, and where to even site. Early in the morning I reached out to my manager to explain the situation and he called me and we had a 3 min team chat where he said he would assign me an onboarding guide. The whole day went by, nothing. Still nothing. And I still don’t have the guide.\n\nToday, 3rd… I had a one-hr HR meeting scheduled. Did that from 10 to 11. Since after that nothing else.

I am on campus, not knowing where my desk is, who my teammates are, what my onboarding process is. Nothing. \n\nI feel like I am wasting my gas and money to go there just to sit in the cafeteria doing absolutely nothing. Tomorrow I’ll be “working” remotely.

Currently I'm interested to continue progressing as an IC but I have zero interest in management, because I hate having to have that responsibility and sitting in meetings all day long sounds horrid.\n\nMy concern though is that above senior, it seems your responsibilities end up becoming cross-team. With that sounds like a lot of stress. The people I work closely with that are above senior seem like they're always busy throughout the day and even get pinged oftentimes post 5 or 6PM. Feels like they always have a ton on their plate to do both in terms of coding, designs, attending meetings, etc. And the ones I know even still feel like their output outside of meetings is high. Like their brain is just completely on for the entirety of the work day, something I cannot do.\n\n\nI hope to progress above Senior but I don't want to have to sacrifice a ton of WLB for that. Currently I enjoy my WLB. I work remotely, start at like 9-9:30 and end at 5-6, depending on if I have impromptu meetings (my personal policy is end independent work at 5 but if someone needs to meet with me I can stretch until 6, especially since my team is in CT or PST). I completely ignore any pings before/after and that's not a problem. I feel like with my current workload in my team and company, I can progress in my career while still having sufficient brain breaks throughout the day, and at least in my team, there's good support and little pressure.\n\n\nAt risk of sounding greedy, my current TC is around like $200k~ but I hope to reach like $300k+ in <7 years, without having to kill myself with work and stress for it. I also have problems with anxiety which is pretty bad in high-pressure, hectic environments that I assume a lot of higher level engineers have to deal with given their responsibilities. I know other companies can pay that amount of mid-level and seniors...but they also work you to the bone. I want to know if my prospects are too idealistic, hence why I'm asking if engineers above senior here can pitch in and let me know how their WLB experiences have been like. Obviously it's company and team dependent but I assume there's a level of similarity between companies given a similar breadth and depth of responsibilities.\n\n\nAnd I guess a second question to my main one is if you guys think (if you can even predict the future) that the answers to my first question are even relevant like 7+ years down the line.",

I contributed to core distributed systems work and overall would say I had a strong start to my career.\n\nUnfortunately I left without another job lined up, mostly due to burnout and a family tragedy (my brother passed away). When this initially happened I tried to push through and keep the job anyway but once I had some level of financial cushion to support it I thought that thought a year or two out of the workforce would help me process some of the grief I was feeling day to day. The time off ended up lasting longer than I anticipated because it hasn’t been exactly easy to get hired again. I’m actively rebuilding momentum — applying to jobs, prepping for interviews, working on side projects, reconnecting with mentors, and I also got accepted into an MS CS program this fall (with a focus on AI/ML).\n\nThe gap will be around 2–3 years total by the time I’m back in full swing. I’m not sure whether to focus fully on grad school or keep pushing hard for jobs now. Part of me worries I burned too much credibility by leaving when I did and being out this long.\n\nSo here’s my question:\nHas anyone here come back successfully from a gap like this? Do hiring managers actually give people like me a second shot, or should I expect to start from a lower level (if I get hired at all)?\n\nAny blunt or realistic advice is appreciated. Thanks.\n\nEdit/Context: I had 2 YOE including an internship at the same company before taking the gap.",

I always liked technology and thought I’d do well pursuing a computer science but after doing my first year in two parts, I’m honestly not sure.\n\nEnded my year with only a 2.5 GPA. Surprisingly I did meh in my other classes but still passed (C’s, B-‘s) profs were probably generous, but I did horrible in my Java class and got a D, so I’d have to retake it. Overtime I feel like I’ve grown disinterested in Java and as much as I tried in the classes (along with my other ones), but there’s just no way I can catch up on pace especially given the fact that during classes I also had to work part time 20 hours/week to help my family with rent/utilities/etc. I ended up relying a lot on “online tools” more than I’d like to admit, as disappointing as it is to the integrity of my university. Hate to make excuses but I really would dedicate more time to my studies if I didn’t have to work so much, I live with a single parent who is lower income and I have to help out.\n\nThat being said, I’m wondering if I should change my major to Political Science or a related field, like maybe History or something in the Humanities field. My best class was an A- in Sociology, which I took as an Elective. I also went to a political science professor’s lectures often out of interest, and he’s pretty damn good. I sometimes engaged more than the people actually taking the course did.\n\nPolitics or History (particularly Canadian) something I’ve grown extremely interested in over the past few years now and I’m pretty knowledgeable on Legislative matters. I’ve used newspaper archives often and contributed to hundreds (and personally written 100+) of encyclopedic texts about New Brunswick related topics on Wikipedia, so it’s probably clear I have much more of an interest in Humanities/Politics/History than I do CS. If you’ve read anything New Brunswick-related on WP chances are I’ve contributed to it in some shape or form. I’d be interested in maybe some sort of Government position but I’m just concerned about job opportunities for that field. \n\nWhichever route I take, I’ll have to take out a student loan due to being low income. I do feel pretty disappointed in myself for making these sort of considerations after a year though; I had used up all of the RESP money saved up for me towards something I performed so poorly in and I’d feel even more behind on life than I already do if I were to switch.\n\nAny potential advice?

While work hours and pay is decent, it is only a contract role, career progression is very slow if converted, and I have very little interest in my current industry. So I am looking to job hop in the next couple of years.\n\nI am competent at front end, but I struggle with backend tasks as I lack exp. I often require guidance on how to do stuff like Kafka streams, microservice programming in C#, SQL Schema configuration etc. In fact, it has come to the point where my team lead has stopped giving me backend tasks altogether, saying that I should just focus on front end for now, which was demoralising for me.\n\nI am definitely concerned for my future plans to job hop as I feel the competition. You have:\n\n1. Highflyer CS fresh grads who have tons of hackathon, internship and project exp who memorise all of Leetcode, and can easily land jobs at MNCs/Big Tech\n2. Offshore foreign devs who can do a junior’s work at a fraction of the cost and with more work hours\n3. AI LLMs which can streamline all the work of multiple junior devs\n\nMeanwhile there is me who cant even land a permanent role after uni grad and cant do backend coding to save his life.\n\nI am considering what to do at this point. My original idea was to read up on the side and do another web dev project tied to cloud services to showcase my fullstack skills, for a cause/industry that I’m passionate in. But the competition and job economy for devs will just not get easier from now on.\n\nRealistically however, would it be better for me as an average dev to eventually pivot to project management instead? From what I read, PM roles rely more on industry domain knowledge and soft skills, of which fresh grads, offshore devs, or AI LLMs would tend to not be as strong in. I do have some project leadership exp from various CCA and volunteering opportunities in the past. And of course, this still allows me to work on tech related projects.   \n  \nCan anyone advise me on this? Much appreciated.",

I don’t mind it too much as I’m in good terms with her and she mostly leaves me the fuck alone because 90% of the time I close out all my tickets.\n\nI’ve been working on this project that uses a LLM model to generate some output, but I don’t think it’s the right project to solve with LLMs because of the inconsistencies/inaccuracies generated in the output. But my manager seems to be convinced that we can make it work, we just need to try harder (improve the prompt, adjust the code, etc.) My company has zero experience building AI products wants to jump in the AI bandwagon and my manager wants to impress c-suite folks by solving business problems with AI. I have voiced my concerns several times how we are trying to solve a problem with the wrong tool or how we should change our approach as the project requires a more deterministic output. I have been ignored everytime and was either asked to just “improve the process a little more” or “don’t think too much, it’ll be fine”. I put duck tapes here and there and the end product is shit. My manager convinced me its fine as long as we make efforts in a positive direction, and at the end if we can’t build this there’s no real repercussions. Long story cut short we are few months into the project and I had to demo the app to the client we are building this for and they weren’t impressed with the inconsistencies in the output. Because at the end of the day it’s nothing like what my manager promised them and they are on our asses to build a working solution ASAP.\n\nAt this point I think you can guess who’s on the hook for all of this? Fortunately the concerns I have expressed to her during the initial phase of the project is documented in emails. But at my company upper management doesn’t want to hear/doesn’t care if your direct manager is being a dick/is incapable and they tell you “you need to figure this out with your manager. Ain’t there nothing I can do about this”. So between me and my manager they’ll just take her word against mine (even with email proof) as I’m more “dispensable” in their eyes? If this project fails more than likely I’ll be blamed and let go as I’ve no doubt she’ll use me as a scapegoat.\n\nWhat’s my move here? I can’t just work harder during the weekends and crank this out. Really need your advice so I can form a strategy. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

How many applications, interviews, months did it take?\n\nAround 80% of the remote jobs I see are all 150kish which is lower than what I'm making currently. I'm sitting at 6 years of experience instead of what seems to be the standard 8 that people want for 200k a year plus jobs.\n\nSo, I'm wondering, is it worth looking right now? I'm currently making 166k + 10% bonus as an associate cloud architect, and it's been slim pickings when I look.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nResume:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/kbXW4wL#KZcIErO",

        "author": "aDoge",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi everyone, I’m torn between taking a job offer I just received, or staying in my current position, and I could really use some help making a decision.\n\n**Background:** 3.5 YOE as an AI/ML engineer (US citizen), 1.5 years at current company\n\n# Current Position\n\n* AI engineer at unicorn startup (lesser-known)\n* $200k base + 10-25% performance bonus\n\n# New Offer\n\n* Founding ML engineer at pre-seed B2B healthcare/pharma startup\n* $195k base + 0.75% equity\n* May be able to negotiate a small signing bonus\n\nSo purely from a TC perspective, I'd be sacrificing 5k base pay and \\~20-50k bonuses for 0.75% equity.\n\n# Key Considerations\n\n**Stability Concerns:** Current company has had back-to-back layoffs this year, and the product I'm working on isn't viable in its current form. There's a potential pivot opportunity, but it's unclear if leadership will pursue it or cut losses. I'm confident in job security through Q1/Q2 2026, but beyond that is uncertain.\n\nThe startup obviously carries its own risks - they have one year of runway and are planning a $4-6M seed round in 2026. If they fail to raise, I’d be cooked.  But I do think they have an acceptable shot at hitting their fundraising goal – the CEO is a previous founder; both the CEO and CTO are Ivy grads in their late 30s with a lot of relevant industry experience; the business model makes sense; they have customers lined up, with each contract bringing in between 300-500k in revenue (contracts are not typically recurring).\n\n**Learning & Growth:** My current role has limited learning opportunities. While I have a strong new manager, the learning is sporadic rather than structured. Our well-staffed DE and DevOps teams mean I'm siloed in applied AI work, and we're focused on low-hanging fruit rather than challenging problems due to company priorities.\n\nThe startup role would give me hands-on MLOps and data engineering experience since I'd be building infrastructure from scratch. The downside is less mentorship and smaller data volumes compared to what I could potentially work with at my current company.\n\n**Long-term Goals:** Like many in this field, I'm aiming for Big Tech eventually. I've seen founding engineer experience listed as a plus on some roles (including at OpenAI/Anthropic), but I'm concerned about having enough time to prep for technical interviews at an early-stage startup.\n\n**Job Hopping Concerns:** Leaving after 1.5 years feels early, especially since my previous role was just under 2 years. Worried about appearing like a job hopper.\n\n**Looking for advice on:** How to weigh these tradeoffs, particularly the loss in TC, the stability/learning balance, and whether the founding engineer experience outweighs the potential downsides.\n\nThanks so much for reading.  I welcome any perspective.",
