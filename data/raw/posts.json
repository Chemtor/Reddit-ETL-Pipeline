        "author": "MikeDoesEverything",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In contrast to the vast number of posts which are basically either:\n\n* Announcing they are quitting\n* Complaining they can't get a job\n* Complaining they can't do their current job\n* \"I heard DE is dead.  Source: me.  Zero years experience in DE or any job for that matter. 25 years experience in TikTok.  I am 21 years old\"\n* Needing projects\n* Begging for \"tips\" how to pass the forbidden word which rhymes with schminterview (this one always gets a chuckle)\n* Also begging for \"tips\" on how to do their job (I put tips in inverted commas because what they want is a full blown solution to something they can't do)\n* AI generated posts (whilst I largely think the mods do a great job, the number of blatant AI posts in here is painful to read)\n\nI thought a nice change of pace was required.  So here it is - I'm a DE who is happy and is actually writing this post using my own brain.\n\nAbout me: I am self taught and have been a DE for just under 5 years ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/lmi2lg/from_a_beginner_to_beginners_from_printhello/)).  Spend most of my time doing quite interesting (to me) work where I have a data focussed, technical role building a data platform.  I earn a decent amount of money with which I'm happy with.\n\nMy work conditions are decent with an understanding and supportive manager.  Have to work weekends? Here's some very generous overtime.  Requested time off? No problem - go and enjoy your holiday and see you when you back with no questions asked.  They treat me like a person, I turn up every day and put in the extra work when they need me to.  Don't get me wrong, I'm the most cynical person ever although my last two managers have changed my mind completely.\n\nI dictate my own workload and have loads of freedom.  If something needs fixing, I will go ahead and fix it.  Opinions during technical discussions are always considered and rarely swatted away.  I get a lot of self satisfaction from turning out work and am a healthy mix of proud (when something is well built and works) and not so proud (something which really shouldn't exist but has to).  My job security is higher than most because I don't work in the US or in a high risk industry which means slightly less money although a lot less stress.\n\nRegularly get approached for new opportunities of both contract and FTE although have no plans on leaving any time soon because I like my current everything.  Yes, more money would be nice although the amount of \"arsehole pay\" I would need to cope working with, well, potential arseholes is quite high at the moment.\n\nBefore I get asked any predictable questions, some observations:\n\n* Most, if not all, people who have worked in IT and have never done another job are genuinely spoilt.  Much higher salaries, flexibility, and number of opportunities than most fields along with a lower barrier to entry, infinite learning resources, and possibility of building whatever you want from home with almost no restrictions.  My previous job required 4 years of education to get an actual entry level position, which is on-site only, and I was extremely lucky to have not needed a PhD. I got my first job in DE with £40-60 of courses and a used, crusty Dell Optiplex from Ebay.  The \"bad job market\" everybody is experiencing is probably better than most jobs best job market.\n* If you are using AI to fucking write REDDIT POSTS then you don't have imposter syndrome because you're a literal imposter.  If you don't even have the confidence to use your own words on a social media platform, then you should use this as an opportunity because arranging your thoughts or developing your communication style is something you clearly need practice with.  AI is making you worse to the point you are literally deferring what words you want to use to a computer.  Let that sink in for a sec how idiotic this is.  Yes, I am shaming you.\n* If you can't get a job and are instead reading this post, then seriously get off the internet and stick some time into getting better.  You don't need more courses.  You don't need guidance.  You don't need a fucking mentor.  You need discipline, motivation, and drive.  Real talk: if you find yourself giving up there are two choices.  You either take a break and find it within you to keep going or you can just do something else.\n* If you want to keep going: then keep going.  Somebody doing 10 hours a week and are \"talented\" will get outworked by the person doing 60+ hours a week who is \"average\". Time in the seat is a very important thing and there are no shortcuts for time spent learning.  The more time you spend learning new things and improving, the quicker you'll reach your goal.  What might take somebody 12 months might take you 6.  What might take you 6 somebody might learn in 3.  Ignore everybody else's journey and focus on yours.\n* If you want to stop: there's no shame in realising DE isn't for you.  There's no shame in realising ANY career isn't for you.  We're all good at something, friends.  Life doesn't always have to be a struggle.\n\nAMA\n\nEDIT: Jesus, already seeing AI replies.  If I suspect you are replying with an AI, you're giving me the permission to roast the fuck out of you.",

        "content": "**After working as a DA for 1 year, DS/MLE for 3 years, and DE for 4, my outlook on this field (and life in general, sadly) has never been bleaker.** \n\nEvery position I've been in has had its own frustrations in some way: team is overworked, too much red tape, lack of leadership, lack of organization/strategy, hostile stakeholders, etc...And just recently, **management laid off some of our team because they \"think we should be able to use AI to be more productive\".** \n\nI feel like I have been searching for that mystical \"dream job\" for years, and yet it seems that I am further away from obtaining it as ever before. With AI having already made so much progress, I'm starting to think that this dream job I have been looking for may no longer even exist. \n\nEven though I've enjoyed my job at times in the past, **at this point, I think I'm done with this career.** \n\nI have lost all the passion that I originally had 8 years ago, and I don't foresee it ever returning. What will I do next? Who knows. I have a few months of savings that will keep me afloat before I figure that out, and if money starts running out, my backup plan is to become a surf instructor in Fiji (or something along those lines).   \n\n\n\nBefore the layoffs, my team was already using AI, and, while it's been increasingly useful, the tech is no where near the point of replacing multiple tenured engineers, at least in our situation. \n\nWe've been pretty good on staying up-to-date with AI trends - we hopped on Cursor back in February and have been using Claude Code since April. However, our codebase is way too convoluted for consistent results, and we lack proper documentation for AI agents to implement major changes. After several failed attempts to solve these issues, I find Claude Code only useful for small, localized features or fixes. Until LLMs can extrapolate code to understand the underlying business context, or write code that is fully aware of end-to-end system dependencies, my team will continue to face these problems. \n\n**My favorite part about working in data has always been when I get to solve challenging problems through code, but this has completely disappeared from my day-to-day work**. Writing complex logic is a fun challenge, and it's very rewarding when you finally build a working solution. Unfortunately, this is one of the few things AI is much more efficient than me at doing, so I barely do it anymore. Instead, I'm basically supervising a junior engineer (Claude) that does the work while I handle the administrative / PM duties. Meanwhile, I'm even more busy than before since we are all picking up the extra workload from our teammates that were let go. \n\nAs AI capabilities continue to improve, this part of my job will surely become a larger amount of my time, and I simply can't see myself doing it any more than I already am. I had a short stint as a manager a couple years ago, and while it wasn't for me, it was at least rewarding to help actual people. Instructing a LLM was interesting and fun at first, but the novelty wore off several months ago, and I now find it to be irritating above anything else. \n\nMost of my experience comes from startups and mid-sized companies, but it really hit me yesterday when talking to my friend who is a DS at a FAANG. She has been dealing with her own frustrations at work, and although her situation is very different than mine, she voiced the same negative sentiments that I had been feeling. I am now thinking that my feelings are more widespread than I thought. Or maybe I have just had bad luck. ",

        "author": "Key_Salamander234",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\n\n\nSo I've been diving into AI for the past few months (this is actually my first real project) and got a bit frustrated with how \"dumb\" LLMs can be when it comes to navigating complex SQL databases. Standard text-to-SQL is cool, but it often misses the business context buried in weirdly named columns or implicit relationships.\n\n\n\nMy idea was to build a semantic layer on top of a SQL database (PostgreSQL in my case) using a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j. The goal is to give an LLM a \"map\" of the database it can actually understand.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's the core concept:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nInstead of just tables and columns, the Python framework builds a graph with rich nodes and relationships:\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Node Types:\\*\\* We have \\`Database\\`, \\`Schema\\`, \\`Table\\`, and \\`Column\\` nodes. Pretty standard stuff.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Properties are Key:\\*\\* This is where it gets interesting. Each \\`Column\\` node isn't just a name. I use GPT-4 to synthesize properties like:\n\n\\*   \\`business\\_description\\`: \"Stores the final approval date for a sales order.\"\n\n\\*   \\`stereotype\\`: \\`TIMESTAMP\\`, \\`PRIMARY\\_KEY\\`, \\`STATUS\\_FLAG\\`, etc.\n\n\\*   \\`confidence\\_score\\`: How sure the LLM is about its analysis.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Rich Relationships:\\*\\* This is the core of the semantic layer. The graph doesn't just have \\`HAS\\_COLUMN\\` relationships. It also creates:\n\n\\*   \\`EXPLICIT\\_FK\\_TO\\`: For actual foreign keys, a direct, machine-readable link.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*\\`IMPLICIT\\_RELATION\\_TO\\`\\*\\*: This is the fun part. It finds columns that are logically related but have no FK constraint. For example, it can figure out that \\`users.email\\_address\\` is semantically equivalent to \\`employees.contact\\_email\\`. It does this by embedding the descriptions and doing a vector similarity search in Neo4j to find candidates, then uses the LLM to verify.\n\n\n\nThe final KG is basically a \"human-readable\" version of the database schema that an LLM agent could query to understand context before trying to write a complex SQL query. For instance, before joining tables, the agent could ask the graph: \"What columns are semantically related to \\`customer\\_id\\`?\"\n\n\n\nSince I'm new to this, my main question for you all is: \\*\\*is this actually a useful approach in the real world?\\*\\* Does something like this already exist and I just reinvented the wheel?\n\n\n\nI'm trying to figure out if this idea has legs or if I'm over-engineering a problem that's already been solved. Any feedback or harsh truths would be super helpful.\n\n\n\nThanks!",

        "title": "The Anatomy of a S3-Native Distributed Query Engine",
        "author": "heisenberg_zzh",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering,\n\nI'm the co-founder of Databend, an open source Snowflake alternative, and I wanted to share a bit of our journey building a SQL query engine that's designed to live on cloud storage like S3. This isn't a sales pitch—just an honest, educational walkthrough of the \"why\" behind our architecture. If you've ever been curious about what happens inside a query engine or why your queries on data lakes sometimes feel slow, I hope this sheds some light.\n\n**The Dream: A Database on S3**\n\nLike many of you, we love S3. It's cheap, it's huge, and it's durable. The dream is to just point a SQL engine at it and go, without managing a complex, traditional data warehouse. But there's a catch: S3 is a network service, and the network is *slow*.\n\nA single data request to S3 might take 50-200 milliseconds. In that tiny slice of time, your CPU could have executed millions of instructions. If your query engine just sits there and waits for the data to arrive, you're essentially paying for expensive CPUs to do nothing. This latency is the single biggest monster you have to slay when building a database on S3.\n\n**Why We Built a New Query Executor**\n\nWhen we started, we naturally looked at classic database designs. They're brilliant pieces of engineering, but they were born in a world of fast, local disks.\n\n1. **The \"Pull\" Model (aka the \"Volcano\" model):** Think of this like a game of telephone. The final step of your query plan (e.g., `SUM()`) asks the step before it for a row, which asks the step before it, and so on, all the way down to the data source. It's simple and has a nice, natural flow. **But on S3, it's a performance disaster.** When the first operator in the chain asks S3 for data, the *entire assembly line* of operators grinds to a halt. Your CPUs are idle, just waiting for data to arrive, while you're burning money on compute you can't use.\n2. **The \"Push\" Model (Vectorized Execution):** This is more like a factory assembly line. The data source pushes batches of data to the first worker, which processes it and pushes it to the next. It's fantastic for raw CPU performance. **But on S3, it's a memory bomb.** S3 can send data in unpredictable bursts. A fast data-scanning step can easily flood a slower step (like a complex `JOIN`), causing data to pile up in memory until the system crashes.\n\n**From SQL to an Execution Plan**\n\nSo, how does a simple SQL string like `SELECT * FROM ...` turn into a plan that our workers can run? It's a multi-stage process, a bit like a chef turning a recipe into a detailed kitchen workflow.\n\n1. **Parsing:** First, we parse the raw SQL text into a structured format called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This is just a tree that represents the query's grammar, making it understandable for the machine.\n2. **Logical Plan:** Next, we convert the AST into a *logical plan*. This describes the *what* of the query—the sequence of high-level operations needed, like \"scan this table,\" then \"filter these rows,\" then \"aggregate the results.\" It's still abstract and doesn't care about how the data is stored or how many machines we have.\n3. **Physical Plan:** This is where the magic happens. Our query optimizer takes the logical plan and transforms it into a *physical plan*. It looks at table statistics, data layout, and available resources to decide the most efficient *how*. For example, it decides whether to use a Hash Join or a Merge Join, how to distribute work across nodes, and in what order to join tables.\n4. **Executor Graph:** Finally, this physical plan is used to generate the actual graph of `Processor` actors that our scheduler will run. Each step in the physical plan becomes one or more workers in our asynchronous assembly line.\n\nThis whole process ensures that by the time we start executing, we have a cost-optimized, concrete plan ready to go.\n\n**A New Plan: Building for the Cloud**\n\nThe core idea was simple: **a worker should never block waiting for the network.** While it's waiting for S3, it should be able to do other useful work. This is the principle of asynchronous processing.\n\nWe designed a system in Rust based on a few key concepts:\n\n* **Workers as Independent \"Actors\":** Each part of the query plan—a `Filter`, `Join`, `Aggregate`—is an independent worker. Think of it as a specialist on an assembly line with a simple job and its own state.\n* **A Central \"Scheduler\" as the Factory Manager:** Instead of talking to each other, workers report their status to a central scheduler. A worker can raise its hand and say:\n   * \"I'm ready for data!\"\n   * \"I have a batch of data and I'm ready to do some computation.\"\n   * \"I'm about to ask S3 for data, which will take a while. You can check back on me later.\"\n   * \"Whoa, I'm getting overwhelmed! My output buffer is full! Tell the upstream workers to pause.\"\n* **Backpressure as the Safety Valve:** That last status is crucial. It's called **backpressure**, and it's the system's safety valve. It prevents the memory bomb. If a `JOIN` worker gets overwhelmed, it tells the scheduler, which then tells the `Scan` worker to stop fetching data from S3 for a moment. This allows the system to self-regulate and remain stable.\n* **IO Concurrency is Key to Hiding Latency:** Because asking for data is non-blocking, we can ask S3 for hundreds of different data chunks *all at once*. The scheduler then efficiently processes them as they arrive. This allows us to saturate the network connection and hide the latency of any single request, dramatically improving throughput.\n\n**How This Scales to Handle Complex SQL**\n\nThis architecture allows us to scale in two ways:\n\n1. **Multi-threading (Scaling Up):** For a single, large query, we can duplicate parts of the query pipeline. For example, we can have multiple `Scan` and `Partial Aggregate` workers running in parallel on different CPU cores, each processing a different part of the data. A final `Merge` step combines their results.\n2. **Distributed Execution (Scaling Out):** To scale across multiple machines, we treat the network as just another connection between workers. A special `Exchange` worker on one machine can send data to another `Exchange` worker on a different machine. To the rest of the query plan, it's completely transparent. This lets us use the same logic for a single-node query and a 100-node distributed query.\n\n**A Few Hard-Won Lessons**\n\n* **Stability over raw speed:** Building in robust backpressure from day one was the single most important decision for system stability.\n* **Separate your concerns:** We run I/O-heavy tasks (like waiting for the network) and CPU-heavy tasks (like decompressing data) on separate thread pools. This ensures that a long computation doesn't stop the engine from handling new data arriving from S3.\n* **Observability is everything:** When you have thousands of tiny tasks running in parallel, you need great tooling to see what's going on, like query profiles, flamegraphs, and distributed tracing logs to find where the bottlenecks are and why a query is slow.\n\nI hope this was a helpful, non-hyped look into what it takes to build a modern, cloud-native query engine. The concepts of asynchronous processing and backpressure are becoming more and more relevant for all kinds of data systems, not just databases.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions about our architecture or the trade-offs we made!

        "content": "Hi everyone, sorry if my English isn’t very good.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nI’m a fresh graduate in Actuarial Science. Got a Jr. Data Engineer role, but the Senior DE quit right before I joined now I’m the only DE. Everything is a mess (broken pipelines, legacy code, poor management, no guidance, layoffs). On top of that, they expect huge changes, endless requirements, and bad deadlines, with constant meetings leaving no time to work. I’m learning a lot, but I’m burned out and doubting if I should stay or return to actuarial work.\n\nI just graduated in May with a degree in Actuarial Science. And over here it’s common to have an internship while still studying during the semester, so almost everyone graduates with around two years of experience. During my internships, I worked on pension and macroeconomics analysis. Later, I had the opportunity to join a BI team at a fintech. There, I helped improve semantic models, fix dashboards with slow refresh times, and implement better practices. After that, I got another internship offer for the Data Engineering team, which was basically a one person team. I decided to give it a shot, and it turned out to be a good experience: I used Azure for the first time, learned some Scala, Airflow, and PySpark.\n\nFast forward to one month before graduation: an international manufacturer contacted me for a Jr DE position. I doubted if I could fit in, since my technical skills weren’t as strong as CS graduates. After three interviews (one with the Senior DE, where we had an amazing conversation), I got the job offer. I was skeptical, but I accepted it because the Senior DE convinced me it was a great opportunity. I even turned down another offer from an insurance company.\n\nTo my surprise, during onboarding they told me the Senior DE had just quit the Friday before, leaving me as the only DE. After some thought, I accepted. But I wasn’t ready for what I found:\n\n* No documentation\n* Broken pipelines\n* Tons of legacy code from outsourcing during the pandemic\n* Broken dashboards and angry users\n* A messy data lake with no organization\n* A passive-aggressive data steward whenever I try to improve workflows\n* A team using Scrum (my first time) with POs who don’t know what they need\n* A project manager who flames us whenever something goes wrong\n* A “data scientist” who is really used as an analytics engineer\n\nRight now, I’m doing my best: learning best practices, writing documentation, and even working extra hours. But it feels like I’m always just fixing problems. There’s one dashboard that breaks almost every day, pipelines that constantly need re-runs, and new business rules popping up all the time. On top of that, leadership keeps pushing for “big changes” with impossible deadlines, constant requirements, and back-to-back meetings that leave me with almost no time to actually focus on building things.\n\nAfter a 1:1 with my manager, he admitted the company’s vision changes almost daily. The CTO once told me about the importance of building a data driven mindset, but just three days later, layoffs happened and the CTO himself was gone. Now I have no guidance, I don’t know where we’re heading, and I’m doubting my skills.\n\n**What would you do in my position? Should I quit and go back to the actuarial path?**",

        "content": "I hope we can agree that streaming data pipelines (Flink, Spark Streaming) are tougher to build and maintain (DLQ, backfills, out-of-order and late events). Yet we often default to them, even when our data isn’t truly streaming.\n\nAfter seeing how data pipelines are actually built across many organizations, here are 3 signs that tell me streaming might not be the right choice:\n1. Either the source or the destination isn’t streaming - e.g., reading from a batch-based API or writing only batched aggregations.\n2. Recent data isn’t more valuable than historical data - e.g., financial data where accuracy matters more than freshness.\n3. Events arrive out of order (with plenty of late arrivals) - e.g., mobile devices sending cached events once they reconnect.\n\nIn these cases, a simpler batch-based approach works better for me: fewer moving parts, lower cost, and often just as effective.\n\nHow do you decide when to use streaming frameworks?\n\n",

This solution uses a custom Single Message Transform (SMT) to emit OpenLineage events, allowing you to visualize your entire pipeline—from source connectors to Kafka topics and out to sinks like S3 and Apache Iceberg—all within Marquez.\n\nIt's a \"pass-through\" SMT, so it doesn't touch your data, but it hooks into the `RUNNING`, `COMPLETE`, and `FAIL` states to give you a complete picture in Marquez.\n\n**What it does:**\n- **Automatic Lifecycle Tracking:** Capturing `RUNNING`, `COMPLETE`, and `FAIL` states for your connectors.\n- **Rich Schema Discovery:** Integrating with the Confluent Schema Registry to capture column-level lineage for Avro records.\n- **Consistent Naming & Namespacing:** Ensuring your Kafka, S3, and Iceberg datasets are correctly identified and linked across systems.\n\nI'd love for you to check it out and give some feedback. The source code for the SMT is in the repo if you want to see how it works under the hood.\n\n**You can run the full demo environment here:**\nFactor House Local - https://github.com/factorhouse/factorhouse-local\n\n**And the full guide + source code is here:**\nKafka Connect Lineage Guide - https://github.com/factorhouse/examples/blob/main/projects/data-lineage-labs/lab1_kafka-connect.md\n\nThis is the first piece of a larger project, so stay tuned—I'm working on an end-to-end demo that will extend this lineage from Kafka into Flink and Spark next.\n\nCheers!\n",

Note that I did suggest a threshold or margin to flag discrepancies but they refused. The sourced data is incorrect to begin with because of inconsistent data values and now thats being used to validate the pipeline.\n\nThat doesn’t seem right to me, since the whole purpose of cleaning is to fix inconsistencies and remove bad data — so the totals will naturally differ by some margin.\nIs this a common practice, or is there a better way I can frame the validation I’ve already done to show it’s solid.

        "content": "# Dear Data Engineers,\n\nI’ve recently built a production-grade, from-scratch implementation of the ***Apache Arrow*** data standard in **Rust**—shaped to to strike a new balance between ***simplicity***, ***power***, and ***ergonomics***.\n\nI’d love to share it with you and get your thoughts, particularly if you:\n\n* Work in the *(more hardcore end) of the* **data engineering** space\n* Us**e Rust for data pipeline**s, or the Arrow data format for systems / engine / embedded work\n* Build **distributed** or **embedded** software that benefits from Arrow’s memory layout and wire protocols just as much as the columnar analytics it's typically known for.\n\n# Why did I build it?\n\n***Apache Arrow*** (and `arrow-rs`) are very powerful and have reshaped the data ecosystem through zero-copy memory sharing, lean buffer specs, and a rich interoperability story. When building certain types of high-performance data systems in Rust, though (e.g., distributed data, embedded), I found myself running into friction.\n\n# Pain points:\n\n* **Engineering Velocity:** The general-purpose design is great for the ecosystem, but I encountered long compile times *(30+ seconds).*\n* **Heavy Abstraction:** Deep trait layers and hierarchies made some otherwise simple tasks more involved—like printing a buffer or quickly seeing types in the IDE.\n* **Type Landscape:** Many logical Arrow types share the same physical representation. Completeness is important, but in my work I’ve valued a clearer, more consolidated type model. In shaping Minarrow, I leaned on the principle often attributed to Einstein: *“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler\".* This ethos has filtered through the conventions used in the library.\n* **Composability:** I often wanted to “opt up” and down abstraction levels depending on the situation—e.g. from a raw buffer to an Arrow Array—without friction.\n\nSo I set out to build something tuned for engineering workloads that plugs naturally into everyday Rust use cases without getting in the way. The result is an Arrow-*Compatible* implementation from the ground up.\n\n# Introducing: Minarrow\n\nArrow minimalism meets Rust polyglot data systems engineering.\n\n# Highlights:\n\n* Custom `Vec64` allocator: 64-byte aligned, SIMD-compatible. No setup required. Benchmarks indicate alloc parity with standard `Vec`.\n* Six base types (`IntegerArray<T>`, `FloatArray<T>`, `CategoricalArray<T>`, `StringArray<T>`, `BooleanArray<T>`, `DatetimeArray<T>`), slotting into many modern use cases (HFC, embedded work, streaming ) etc.\n* Arrow-compatible, with some simplifications:\n   * Logical Arrow types collapsed via generics (e.g. DATE32, DATE64 → `DatetimeArray<T>`).\n   * Dictionary encoding represented as `CategoricalArray<T>`.\n* Unified, ergonomic accessors: `myarr.num().i64()` with IDE support, no downcasting.\n* Arrow Schema support, chunked data, zero-copy views, schema metadata included.\n* Zero dependencies beyond `num-traits` *(and optional Rayon).*\n\n# Performance and ergonomics\n\n* **1.5s clean build,** <**0.15s rebuilds**\n* **Very fast runtime** *(See laptop benchmarks in repo)*\n* **Tokio-native IPC:** async IPC Table and Parquet readers/writers via sibling crate *Lightstream*\n* **Zero-copy MMAP r**eader *(\\~100m row reads in \\~4ms on my consumer laptop)*\n* **Automatic 64-byte alignment** *(avoiding SIMD penalties and runtime checks)*\n* `.to_polars()` and `.to_arrow()` built-in\n* Rayon parallelism\n* **Full FFI** via Arrow C Data Interface\n* **Extensive documentation**\n\n# Trade-offs:\n\n* **No nested types** *(List, Struct)* or other exotic Arrow types at this stage\n* **Full connector ecosystem** requires \\`.to\\_arrow()\\` bridge to Apache Arrow *(compile-time cost: 30–60s)* . *Note: IPC and Parquet are directly supported in Lightstream.*\n\n# Outcome:\n\n* **Fast, lean, and clean** – rapid iteration velocity\n* **Compatible**: Uses Arrow memory layout and ecosystem-pluggable\n* **Composable**: use only what’s necessary\n* **Performance** **without penalty** (compile times! Obviously Arrow itself is an *outstanding ecosystem*).\n\n# Where Minarrow fits:\n\n* **Ultra-performance data pipelines**\n* **Embedded system and** **polyglot** **apps**\n* **SIMD compute**\n* **Live streaming**\n* **HPC** and low-latency workloads\n* MIT Licensed\n\n# Open-Source sister-crates:\n\n* **Lightstream**: Native streaming with Tokio, for building custom wire formats and minimising memory copies. Includes SIMD-friendly async readers and writers, enabling direct SIMD-accelerated processing from a memory-mapped file.\n* **Simd-Kernels**: 100+ SIMD and standard kernels for statistical analysis, string processing, and more, with an extensive set of univariate distributions.\n* You can find these on crates-io or my GitHub.\n\nRust is still developing in the Data Engineering ecosystem, but if your work touches high-performance data pipelines, Arrow interoperability, or low-latency data systems, hopefully this will resonate.\n\nWould love your feedback.\n\nThanks,\n\nPB\n\n  \n**Github**: [https://github.com/pbower/minarrow](https://github.com/pbower/minarrow)",

Here’s what worked (and what didn’t):\n\n**1. Data ingestion**\n- Mix of **official APIs**, **custom scrapers**, and **file uploads (Excel/CSV)**.\n- APIs are great… until rate limits kick in.\n- Scrapers constantly broke due to DOM changes, so we moved towards a modular crawler architecture.\n\n**2. Transformation & storage**\n- For small data, Pandas was fine; for large-scale, we shifted to a Spark-based ETL flow.\n- Building a schema that supports both **structured fields** and **text blobs** was trickier than expected.\n- We store intermediate results to S3, then feed them into a Postgres + Elasticsearch hybrid.\n\n**3. Analysis & reporting**\n- Downstream consumers wanted dashboards and visualizations, so we auto-generate reports from aggregated metrics.\n- For trend detection, we rely on a mix of TF-IDF, sentiment scoring, and lightweight ML models.\n\nKey takeaways:\n- **Schema evolution** is the silent killer — plan for breaking changes early.\n- Invest in **pipeline observability** (we use OpenTelemetry) to debug failures faster.\n- Scaling ETL isn’t about size, it’s about **variance** — the more sources, the messier it gets.\n\nCurious if anyone here has tackled **multi-platform ETL** before:\n- Do you centralize all raw data first, or process at the edge?\n- How do you manage scraper reliability at scale?\n- Any tips on schema evolution when source structures are constantly changing?\n",

For context, the base data on which we want to visualize metrics is about \\~5TB of metrics data daily, with 2+ years of data. The goal is to visualize to daily fidelity, with a high level of slice and dice.\n\nSo far my process has been to precompute aggregable metrics across all queryable dimensions (imagine group by date, country, category, etc), and then point something like Snowflake or Trino at it to aggregate over those aggregated partials based on the specific filters. The issue is this is still a lot of data, and sometimes these query engines are still slow (couple seconds per query), which is annoying from a user standpoint when using a dashboard.\n\nI'm wondering if it makes sense to pre-aggregate all OLAP combinations but in a more key-value oriented way, and then use Postgres hstore or Cassandra or something to just do single-record lookups. Or maybe I just need to give up on the pipe dream of sub second latency for highly dimensional slices on petabyte scale data.\n\nHas anyone had any awesome success enabling a similar use case?",

I needed vector search with sophisticated metadata filtering, but existing solutions were either,\n\n-Too bloated (full vector databases when I needed something minimal for analysis)\n-Limited in filtering capabilities\n-Had unintuitive APIs that I was not happy about.\n\nI wanted something minimal, fast, and with an API that feels natural - inspired by Polars, which I absolutely love.\n\nWhat Makes Otters Different\n\nExact Search: Perfect for small-to-medium datasets (up to ~10M vectors) where accuracy matters more than massive scale.\n\nPerformance: \n-SIMD-accelerated scoring\n-Zonemaps and Bloom filters for intelligent chunk pruning\n\nPolars-Inspired API: Write filters as simple expressions\n```\nmeta_store.query(query_vec, Metric::Cosine)\n    .meta_filter(col(\"price\").lt(100) & col(\"category\").eq(\"books\"))\n    .vec_filter(0.8, Cmp::Gt)\n    .take(10)\n    .collect()\n```\n\nThe library is in very early stages and there are tons of features that i want to add\nPython bindings, NumPy support\nSerialization and persistence\nParquet / Arrow integration\nVector quantization\netc.\n\nI'm primarily a Python/JAX/PyTorch developer, so diving into rust programming has been an incredible learning experience.\n\nIf you think this is interesting and worth your time, please give it a try.\nI welcome contributions and feedback !\n\nhttps://crates.io/crates/otters-rs\nhttps://github.com/AtharvBhat/otters",

We will also get an understanding the development journey of any real world project and we will be able to create projects with professionalism.\n\nThe first component of this project is complete and I want to share this with you all.\n\nThe most important component of this project is the Data. The data component is divided into 2 parts:-  \n**Content Metadata** and **Transactional Data.** The content data is the metadata of the movies and tv shows which will be rendered on the front end. All the data related to transactions and user navigation will be handled in the Transactional Data part.\n\nAs content data is going to be document based hence we will be use NoSQL database for this. In our case we are using **MongoDB.**   \nIn this part of the project we have created the modules which contain the methods to fetch and load the initial bulk data of movies, tv shows and credits in our MongoDB that will be rendered on the frontend. The modules are reusable, hence using this we will be automating the pipeline. I have attached the workflow image of the project yet.   \nFor more information checkout the GitHub link of the project: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Kartikrast/dvd-rental-data-pipelines)\n\nNext Steps:-\n\n\\- automating the bulk loading pipeline  \n\\- creating a pipeline to handle and updates changes[](https://github.com/Kartikrast/dvd-rental-data-pipelines)\n\nPlease fam check this out and give me your feedback or any suggestions, I would love to hear from you guys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r0uod4ajxcnf1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a85d14e118e455b63bd353d27e53b611c37439a\n\n",

It needs to continuously fetch updates, apply change data capture (CDC), and keep the index live.\n\nThat’s exactly the kind of foundational use case my guide covers. I’d love your brutal feedback on whether this is useful in your workflows.\n\nThe approach builds on the Pathway framework (a stream data processing engine with Python wrappers). What we’ve used here are pre-built components already deployed in production by engineering teams.\n\nOn top of that, we’ve just released the Pathway MCP Server, which makes it simple to expose your live ETL outputs and analytics to client apps and downstream services.\n\nCircling back to the example, here’s how you can set this up step by step:\n\n* Capture your data streams as Pathway tables (with CDC built in). [https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/pathway\\_mcp\\_server/](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/pathway_mcp_server/)\n* Define your transformations for aggregations, counts, or joins — they stay current as new rows flow in.\n* Expose the continuously updated tables/analytics via Pathway MCP Server, so other services can query the current state. [https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/pathway-mcp-claude-desktop/](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/pathway-mcp-claude-desktop/)\n\nPS – many teams start with our YAML templates for quick deployment, but you can always write full Python code if you need finer control.",

Does that implicate on the difficulty of debugging in some cases?\n\nDo you embed this data in the response? If so, are you scanning your raw data to determine start point in subsequent runs or do you scan your raw table (table = post processing results of the raw formatted data)?\n\nDo you implement sensors between every stage in the data lifecycle to automatically batch process the entire process in an event driven way?

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just started my first ever job as a junior  dev last week (fresh out of school), and honestly it already feels like a disaster. I’m starting to question myself a bit.\n\nMy first day was Monday, and by Friday I was already in home office. Same today too and Monday too. The only office days are Wednesday and Thursday, which feels a bit sad because I’m brand new and immediately working from home with barely any guidance is to much.\n\nI never really got a proper introduction to the project, the systems, or how tickets are normally solved. My very first ticket was basically: “Yo, look in our system, I have a ticket for you, try to solve it. If you have questions, ask me…” That’s it. No walkthrough, no explanation of where to start. I asked how they usually approach tickets or where to even find the relevant code, but I still felt pretty lost.\n\nTo be fair, I did get a decent intro into the running software itself, so I kind of understand the product. But that’s where it ended. Meanwhile, I see other people who started just a month before me sitting next to their team lead getting tons of explanations and support.\n\nSomehow I managed to solve 3 tickets (a mix of with and without help), but most of the time I have nothing to do. I’m just sitting here, bored, not knowing what I should be learning or focusing on.\n\nI’ve tried to be proactive and ask what I could look into:\n\nYesterday I asked if there were patterns or frameworks I should study. The response was just: “Take a look at EF and how we make the models\" EF and setting up a config for models isnt that hard so I understood it quite fast.\n\nToday I asked again and just got sent some tickets to read through “to see if I understand what the customer wants.” which is so overwhelming.\n\nAnother coworker told me to check out their validation logic cause I will be working with this part of the project, but there are a ton of files with different rules and it’s overwhelming to dig into alone at home.\n\nSo now I’m just sitting here wondering: am I doing something wrong? Is it normal to feel this lost and useless in the first week? Or did I pick the wrong career path entirely?\n\nIt’s super frustrating because I want to learn and contribute, but right now it feels like I’m just drifting.\n\nHas anyone else been in this situation? Is this just how the start usually feels, or is this a red flag?",

From zero experience to code delivering myself. :-D\nI did a small project myself, never worked as programmer or coded in pair or read a someone else's code. I also have no IT background, from blue collar to Python backend programmer.\n\nAnd now I got a very bad CR on my code. My code was working, but it didn't fit expectations well. Too many things I didn't consider. I had to modify few endpoints with few more data, so I digged into the project I don't understand fully, but I found the way where to get those data, how to validate them, format them and send them. Okay, working.\nBut every piece of my code I got to rework. I have to agree, they are right with that and I admit their solution is better, my was just 'working', but not following the conventions, rules and architecture.\n\nAnd I just feel dumb. I ask why didn't I realize that. Maybe I look dumb and they will fire me because I am really dumb and not competent enough.\n\nI have to say, I never pushed buggy code. Always working and fitting the requirements of outcome; always written and passing tests.\nBut never got aproved without reworking. There was always at least one thing to redo better, in terms of consistency, readability or just for a reason they find useful in future while I didn't see it. (Like when they consider future plans of features and they know this detail will become handy in future).\n\nSo maybe I ask for reassurance. Or for warning if I am really in danger and have to improve asap because I am not enough to compete juniors.\n\nJust tell me your opinion or your experience.\n\nEDIT: they are super nice to me, like \"don't worry, just improve it, here is how\", they answer my questions and help me. I just feel as a burden now.",

It's hard to write tests because the expected inputs and code-flow are unknown. To overcome this, I am planning to add detailed logging to the function. The goal is to capture its behavior with various inputs and use those logs to generate a reliable set of test cases.\n\n**Refactor the logic**.

I spend hours learning, watching tutorials, and building small things, but it never feels like enough. Every time I look at other devs’ portfolios or hear about their progress, I feel like I’m falling behind — even though I’ve only just started seriously.\n\nI don’t have money for bootcamps or fancy courses, just my setup and free resources online. I want to become a senior developer as fast as possible, but it feels like I’m running in place. The overthinking and self-doubt are killing me more than the lack of skill itself.\n\nI want to grow, ship real projects, and actually see myself improving, but right now I feel lost and demotivated. I know I have time on my side, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that I’m already behind everyone else.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this? How did you push through the mental block and actually start seeing progress? Any advice for breaking out of this stuck feeling would help.\n\nThanks for reading.\n",

        "content": "I've been doing a little research on different approaches to structuring your projects, and so far I've heard of (and read the wikipedia pages on) OOP, Data Oriented Design, and Functional Programming.\n\nI'm most familiar with OOP, and I find it quite intuitive as well, however during my research I've inadvertently stumbled into discourse about its viability. One argument I keep seeing repeated as one of the cardinal sins of OOP is that its structure encourages statefulness somehow. I understand the difference between stateful and stateless programs, but I struggle to think of a practical reason for reducing states.\n\nA lot of the applications of programming I can think of depend on state in some way or another (Saving and loading a game, text editors, email clients, image converters, etc.), and it feels like there is little to no point in having stateless programs as they would lack the ability to do anything because they would not be able to interact with other parts of the project.\n\nEssentially, my questions boil down to:\n\n1. Why is statefulness considered bad?\n2. How does OOP encourage statefulness?\n3. And finally, why is statelessness preferred over statefulness?",

My thought-process is basically \"if I don't know how it ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE VISUALLY, I don't know what to do/type\". It just occurred to me that despite not being exactly a newbie-programmer, I've never really successfully solved my problems myself. The solutions I get is always from EXACTLY copying a sample source or someone else's code. You ever heard of the saying \"figure it out yourself\"? I literally cannot do that; I just don't have the mental capacity to do so. I have to copy, or I can't do anything.\n\n  \nTechnically I can understand high-level concepts to a degree, but at the end of the day I'm always going to say \"yeah.., I get it.., I understand the concept here but....., do you have a sample I can look at?\". I really think there's a certain level of hard-requirement for being proficient at any technical skill, and that is to be able to implement something by actually \"figuring it out yourself\"; for times where you just don't have access to resources like documentation or online source codes, online tutorials, etc..., and I think even till now, I just never met this IQ-requirement. You could even pass me a sample code and say \"see this section of the code? Just change it a bit....\", and I will ask you \"okay sure.., but do you have a sample of how that looks like?\"\n\nI guess I really do qualify as de-facto brainless. I don't really know what to do about that, to be honest. Does anyone have a sample on this?\n\n(Edit: No, I'm not trying to make a joke there)",

On the side, I also learned a bit of Python, mostly basic backend and some data analysis but nothing past tutorials. \n\nIn 2022 I stopped coding for several reasons mainly due to family issues and low self-esteem. I even fumbled a trial opportunity at a company because I couldn’t finish the final project, I felt like I wasn't good enough to do a good job compared to the other ppl in the program; so I just dropped programming altogether and didn't really touch it for years. \n\nNow in 2025 I feel like I’m in a better mental state than a few years ago, but I feel kinda lost on where to start, specially with AI advancing so quickly, I sometimes doubt whether I'll be able to get a job out of it. On top of that, I don’t know where to start since I’ve forgotten so much. Should I go back to basics, or jump straight into a project and learn as I go checking documentation? I'm also afraid I will rely on AI too much and not learn much at all. ",

I've been searching for an online coding tutor, but most of what I'm finding is either way too advanced or clearly not designed for kids.\n\nWe're not looking for a bootcamp or anything overly intense. Just someone who can meet weekly, answer questions, and guide him through projects. Ideally someone who understands how to teach younger students and keep it fun. He's already done some Scratch and Roblox Studio stuff, and he's now messing around with beginner Python and Unity.\n\nAre there good online programming tutors who actually specialize in working with kids or teens? I've seen a few platforms offering online coding tutoring, but it's hard to know what's legit. Open to individual instructors or programs just want something reliable and age-appropriate.\n\nIf anyone has recommendations for online coding tutors or platforms they've used and liked, I'd really appreciate it.",

Well, we can split the string, where each word will be an element in an array. From there, we can apply the reverse method. Once done, we can compare the original vs the reversed, if match we will return 'true'.  \n\n\n    const palindromes = function (word) {\n      //split the string into each letter, into an array\n      let splitWord = word\n        .toLowerCase()\n        .replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '')\n        .split('');\n    \n      console.log(splitWord);\n    \n      let reversed = [...splitWord].reverse();\n      console.log(reversed);\n    \n      let cleanedString = splitWord.join('');\n      let reversedString = reversed.join('');\n    \n      return cleanedString === reversedString;\n    };\n    \n    palindromes('car!');",

If this is feasible, then it would allow me to focus on SQLite for the problems, and then PostgreSQL when implementing users.\n\nI was just wondering about what the best approach is, thanks in advance.",

        "content": "Hello World,\n\nIn October I am starting my 3rd (and last year) of a BA degree in Comp. Sci. I'm currently working in a call center (which is worse than the previous one I worked at) and thought I'd start looking for an internship prior to the last semester in spring.\n\nI feel really unsure of myself and scared. I don't know enough and I don't know if anyone would be willing to take me as an intern without me knowing enough.\n\nApart from my assignments I haven't really built anything myself as I get stuck in a loop of \"I need to do this -> I don't know how to do this -> let's check documentation and tutorials -> I have no idea what I am reading or doing -> I need to practice more -> I need to do this\".\n\nPart of it is because pursuing a degree at my ripe old age of 33 was a bit of a rash decision whilst knowing fully well I do not have the mental capabilities for either programming or coding.\n\nI am good at some things in the computing field (e.g. general tech support (especially printers and software) or databases) but absolutely inept at others (e.g. front end or networks).\n\nI know logically that as an intern you are supposed to go there not knowing specific stuff but my emotional side cannot accept this.\n\nJust today, I thought I'd give Oracle DB XE a chance as my limited experience is in PostgresSQL and DBeaver and I felt as stupid in the trying to establish a db as I felt when I first saw a CLI back in 1999.\n\nTo end this ramble, I know what I think I'd like to do but it's hard to keep the job market requirements and self expectations out of the way.\n\nIf you have any advice regarding this or have been in a similar situation and want to share your thoughts I would welcome it.\n\nTL;DR: No TL;DR I can't summarise this, my brain is currently in a state of <mashed potatoes>.\n\nP.S. This may make absolutely no sense.\n\nEdit: Will delete if this is more suited for r/AskComputerScience ",

I haven't made anything advanced on my own yet and i am somewhat familiar with HTML and Python and i am still getting familiar with CSS. So how would someone like me progress from here and try to improve, whilst having fun (cuz truthfully speaking my attention span isn't looking too good), understanding fundamentals and syntax and just try to feel more comfortable programming and less intimidated by the console.\n\nThanks for reading my long somewhat coherent rant, and i appreciate all the answers and advice i can get :)",

If you encounter the need to switch the tech stack, just rewrite.\n\nThis may seem like a redundant doubt but I am really stressing on it and I believe it is important to get an answer to it.\n\nI have a project idea that's a CLI that I believe can be really useful to many people with regards to popular workflow practices personally and professionally.\n\nI am skilled enough in JS/TS and C to make this application. But, I'm confused which language to choose.\n\nI'm sure that some performance critical parts may require the performance from C. However, I also believe that with how good the runtimes are currently at optimising JS/TS code, performance won't be a huge issue. Unless of course people are using it on 100 files with 1000 LOC.\n\nNow, I also know Rust partly and with my experience of programming languages, it wouldn't be an issue for me to learn Rust (the parts required) while developing the project. Same for Golang.\n\nUltimately, I want to develop it in C, but as someone currently looking for jobs and hopes that this project may get some good attraction, I'm worried that choosing C may become a problem. Finding contributors, people seeing C as not a modern language.\n\nI have the feeling that using Rust, Golang or even Zig may attract more attention to the project.\n\nI would definitely use the project for myself, but it would be good to have people be excited about it and join in it.\n\nNeed views.",

I want to continue coding further however I’m so lost on what to do in order to continue. I know a big thing with Java is android app development, however I don’t daily drive an android.\n\nBut just in general, I don’t have the slightest idea on where to go to develop even just simple .exes or apps on my computer. I know the Java covered in the AP class is obviously not enough but I have no idea where to go next after all the material learned in the class.\n\nThe big thing I want to do with coding is mostly just developing apps (specifically for homebrewed devices like my 3DS) but even then I don’t know how to make an app in general. I know app development takes a pretty big commitment to do, but I just want to try even if it’s just on my free time. Another thing would just be making mods on games I play.\n\nAlso another question is if I should just learn a different language like C++, as that has much more use cases (for me atleast) or if something like Java is enough. \n\nSo I’m just wondering what I can do with my knowledge from the class and where to go next.\n\nIf you guys can share some resources, that would be seriously appreciated.\n\nThanks",

However this requires a lot of joins, and im worried its inefficient.\n\nIf it is helpful, i have attached a json style structure of my current setup: [https://gist.github.com/jokerhutt/7ba4bbd85464a4e2f7821494a685ee18](https://gist.github.com/jokerhutt/7ba4bbd85464a4e2f7821494a685ee18)\n\nApart from finding a users next lesson, i also need to figure out which lessons have been passed and which are locked. With my current setup i'd somehow need to mark all lessons with a lower order\\_index in the current unit as passed, then all units with a lower\\_order index in that section as passed, and all units and lessons in previous sessions as passed. For this would it be better to just have a status column in the lessons table / append that as part of a lessom dto for the frontend to know?\n\ni hope the issue makes sense, thank you guys so much in advance!",

After fork(), there should be two processes with their own logical memory. They will have stack pointer, pointing to the same logical address in their own logical memory. Lets say its x. Now if I declare an integer of 4 bytes, stack would point to x+4, next if I declare a 8 byte integer, pointer should be at x+12. Both processes should have the same addresses for a and b then, x and then x+4. Does this make sense?",

See FRED graph for the downtrend starting at that point and hasn't gone up since. Lets try to stick to the point of the post and not distract from the conversation over half a year.**\n\nAll I constantly hear in this field is \"its cyclical\" and right now is part of a cycle. I am not aware of any other cycle in tech history where the job market has been this bad for this long. Its been nearly 4 years now of a horrible job market and it is only getting worse it seems.\n\nFRED data shows too that right now job posting are as bad if not worse than the worst part of the pandemic, when hardly anyone was hiring. That doesn't factor in all the new games that are being played, like posting of ghost jobs. Factor in that, and it is probably way worse.\n\nAlso, jobs on the broader market just got revised down by almost a 1 million jobs today. Meaning, they overestimated the amount of jobs created by close to 1 million jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, companies \"still can't find qualified candidates\" and we continue to approve more and more visas in the US for mainly tech jobs. Nevermind the massive trend of now shipping jobs overseas or nearshore. Nevermind too the AI going on as well. Yes, I realize that much of the AI stuff is overhyped, but this sub is in denial if they think that hasn't affected hiring trends as well.\n\nI'm sorry, what is this jobs market anymore? When does this madness stop?",

We are not a tech company and only need a few developers to work on our internal software.\n\nBefore this new hire there was only me. I’ve done a very good job and have very good working relationship with my manager who isn’t a developer but oversees everything I do. As the company scales, there’s more work. So we hired someone new.\n\nThis new guy is clearly REALLY into programming. It’s like his hobby. Therefore, obviously compared to a guy like me who only likes software development but wouldn’t actively be writing codes for fun, especially after work, he’s more knowledgeable on a lot of things and due to his passion, he’s willing to work 12 hours days when my manager has clearly stated that it’s not at all expected.\n\nI’ve had conversations with my manager regarding him and voiced my concerns. Because he’s treating the software almost like a passion project and is going so above and beyond which is taking a lot more time and not necessary for what we want to achieve. And I’m also having a hard time keeping up with him on what he is doing and why he’s doing it. I was told not to worry but it still has me wondering. \n\nWhat is my move next? Is this an environment that I should try to thrive in? I know that I can never out compete this guy because I just don’t have that level of passion and willingness to give it all to a job when I have many other things in life that I want to peruse when not working, though with my experience, knowledge and work ethic, I have done a very good job according to my manager and he loves me on the team. But with time, I am worried that he’s going to outperform me so much that there’s no point for me to even try to be on the same team with him.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Every time I see people mention it, it always seems like a joke. However, when you think about it, it makes more sense than replacing ICs. Think about it, why do we have so many layers of management in an organization? It's because one person realistically can't keep track of so many people reporting information to them, so instead they have managers report to them all the way up the chain...\n\nThis is where AI comes in. Instead of ICs reporting to managers, they just all report to the AI. Hell, the AI doesn't even need to be reported to because it already knows what everyone has been doing due to monitoring everyone's computers. All the CEO or board of directors needs to do is ask for updates from the AI. They can get very detailed information or high level overviews. No more time wasted on useless 1 on 1s, you just ask the AI how you could do better or the AI will automatically give you feedback or put you on PIP if needed based on a standard set of criteria, so no bias.\n\nThat solves one problem that is faced by large organizations, but how about another one? Think about all the time spent in meetings between managers to only come up with stupid decisions because normally the loudest voice will just win out and it isn't always the smartest. Instead, the AI can interact directly with the SMEs to assess all the information available and make the most informed decisions. Think of the time savings!\n\nIn conclusion, I think we are headed for a time where mid management will no longer exist. A near flat org mostly run by AI will be the most efficient corporate structure and will out compete all of the competition. Boards of directors will be forced to implement this type of structure because otherwise they will be failing their shareholders.\n\nThoughts?",

        "content": "I left my old job a few weeks ago because I was frustrated with the lack of growth and the salary not even keeping up with inflation. I jumped into what looked like a safer and more stable position. The onboarding was smooth and everyone was friendly but then reality hit me on day one.\n\nThe department I joined is basically one guy and now me. The entire workflow is a storm of spreadsheets and manual emails. I realized almost immediately that the whole thing could be automated with a few scripts and dashboards. What currently takes a week could be done in a couple of hours. Which means the existence of the department itself is hanging by a thread.\n\nHere is the catch. To actually automate I would need direct access to the system and that access has to go through my boss. Doing it on my own is impossible without going through him, and going through him means making myself a direct threat to his role and survival.\n\nOn top of that, in just two days of onboarding I was already dumped with actual work, despite only having the most superficial understanding of their processes and tools. The approach was basically “just figure it out.” There is no documentation at all, and to make it worse the processes themselves are arbitrary. One client gets handled one way, another client gets handled completely differently, with no clear rules or references for why things change. It feels random, improvised, and fragile.\n\nTo make things worse the company has its own AI and digital transformation division. If they ever notice what is really going on, they could easily absorb or eliminate this function. Which leaves me in a place where my job is both fragile and painfully boring.\n\nNow I feel stuck. If I leave too soon my résumé will show a disastrous short stay and I will look unreliable. If I stay I risk wasting my time in something that feels pointless and might get axed anyway. Right now my plan is to keep my head down for a while and later reframe the story as “I improved and automated processes and then decided to move toward project or team management because there was no further path in that role.”\n\nI know a lot of people here have been through bad career moves. I just needed to share this because right now it feels like I made one of the worst professional choices of my life",

        "content": "Im a mid-level engineer who got a new job this year. I was just given my first big project and am working with another mid-level engineer who has been here for about 2 years. We are both working under a PE who is leading the project. \n\nWe have distributed the work and at the start I was wrapping up some bug fixes that my manager asked me to complete. The other mid-level im working with is a really nice guy and he is really motivated which I like. The problem is he is almost too motivated to the point that he has just started coding like crazy and in the first week did some of the work on my plate. I've seen him push code on the weekends at like midnight. One time I asked him if he works onthe weekends and he says sometimes he's bored at home and watches tv and code. I politely let him know that we should work together and I dont want him to feel like he did everything. So he backed off some of my stuff a bit. \n\nBut throughout the project, it seems he is going 150% towards any little changes that need to be added. If we need to add a change, he has just added it. Since he has been here for 2 years, he knows which people to go to outside of us 3 for questions and a few times I heard he had a few meetings with people to discuss things, so i asked him to keep me included as well and to give me any resources of people in case I had questions. He has done better of doing that but a few times forgot to send me some useful stuff.  I was gone for a couple days and in those days he made some major changes. Again I think it's great, but now it feels like the whole code is practically his (maybe 70% of it) and the PE has noticed and even in meetings will talk more to him and say (let's call my co-worker mike for the example) \"Mike can you write a note and make that change\". Barely has directed me. \n\nI feel like I have to step in and say \"ill make this change\" or make it clear that ill do the change. I feel like anything I have discovered ill reach out to him and let him know but I can tell that when it comes to visibility it looks like he's doing 90%. He has done more but I think it's more like 60%-70%. I dont think Mike really is doing this to be spiteful or anything I just think he's one of those people who is just really motivated and just starts and doesnt stop. Again, i think that's great and it definetely has kept me in my feet but I also feel like im getting pushed out. \n\nI should say that I got laid off from my last job before I got this job and i think a reason for it was because I was slightly a more passive engineer and I feel like this could be held against me that Mike did 70% of the work and it may look like I was lazy on this project. \n\nHow can I better handle this situation?",

I don't clear resume screens enough to get OAs very often and even when I crush them I wake up to rejections every morning. Feels like I'm just throwing applications into a void.\n\nI've tried networking, coffee chatting and writing personalized messages to seniors on LinkedIn. I still get auto-rejected even with referrals.

        "content": "I got a message on LinkedIn from my former boss saying that there was a position in his team and that he'd like me to apply. He said the work is good and the company pays well, and I really liked working with him so I decided to apply because I'd like to work with him again and I've been looking for something with better pay anyway.\n\nI started the process with a interview with HR, than interview with the director of the company in my country, then technical interview with one of the people in the team, another interview with one of the main managers but now from the US. A week after that final one, I got a call from HR saying they want to offer me the position. The pay was way higher from what I'm currently getting (which is very low anyway) and I decided to accept the offer.  I asked the guy to send it to me on a message so I have it written down from them, and that it was an ok for me. He said he'd send the offer letter and that my soon to be manager (who was my former boss) would like to talk to me. I said fine, HR set up an interview and I get a \"welcome to team\" meeting, with them even asking what laptop I'd prefer. \n\nI waited for the said offer letter for two weeks, which during that time I even asked if they needed something else from me because I hadn't gotten it yet and the HR guy told me they were \"waiting on the signature from just one other manager who was traveling at the time and didn't have access to his computer\", but assured me everything else was fine. So I kept waiting for another week, send him a message again talking about starting dates and he goes \"Oh, I'm sorry, I've been laid off last week so I can't help you\". I freak out because wtf and send my former boss a message on LinkedIn saying \"hey, I've been waiting for some time now and I just got a message that guy A is not in the company anymore. Is everything ok?\". He said he'd talk to HR, and I send another email to another HR person that contacted me. This other HR person answers me saying she'll check how everything is going and get back to me (this was on Friday). \n\nSo... I finally get another email from them and it was yet ANOTHER person, and he says he's going to see my process now since guy A is not there anymore, but he informs meet that there was a \"misstep\" in the process and I actually need to go through through another round that includes live coding on Hackerrank because that was mandatory and they didn't do it with me before, so the offer they gave me was not valid. \n\nNow... I'm not sure what to do. I'm between leaving a review on Glassdoor saying how shit the whole process was, that I got an offer, a freaking welcome meeting even and then they were like \"oh actually, forget that\" because what if I'd quit my current job after that? Gladly I waited for a formal signed letter from them, but I could still sue them (according to the laws in my country) since I have their offer on a written message and the email with the welcome meeting setup. Or if I should go ahead and do this next round of tests and interviews to see if they'd give me another offer because the initial one had good pay... But I'm still so pissed at them for the whole thing, it was a complete mess and I'm honestly so tired of doing these long ass 1 to 2 hours talking interviews so many times already... I know they're a real company because I've checked several places and I know two people who work there (my former boss, and another person from a previous company I worked at), but doesn't this feel kinda scammy and all over the place? What would you do?\n\nHonestly, this trying to find something better has been so exhausting... It's either no answers at all, a lot of scams (got offered a \"job\" to pose as another developer while said developer would be working on something else which is basically, well, fraud) or a complete mess like this case.\n\nTL:DR: went through the whole process of interviews, got an offer from the company, a welcome meeting asking me what laptop I'd prefer to then getting an email three weeks later saying there was \"misstep\" in the process and the offer was not valid and that I need another round with live coding on Hackerrank and interviews again.",

His dad asked me if there was anything I could do and I cringed, but told him to have the kid text me and I'd see what I could do to get him on track, but not to expect miracles.\n\nMy plan for advising him is to set expectations: not having any experience on his resume exiting college will make it impossible to land any engineering role in the current job market.  He probably needs to run a 3-year-long marathon to get where he wants to be.\n\nI think his only shot is going to be a tech-adjacent role, probably helpdesk or support, but maybe a business analyst or junior product/project manager role if he is incredibly lucky.  Of course, he needs to continue applying to junior engineer openings on the off chance they give him an interview, for the experience of interviewing alone.\n\nEven making these concessions, he needs to wrap his mind around 6 months to a year of applying everyday with nothing to show for it.  If his parents need him to contribute to the household, a McJob will be necessary to make ends meet.\n\nWhile applying, I'd have him come up with a product.  It doesn't have to be groundbreaking, disruptive, profitable, or even revenue-generating.  What's important is that he build it from zero, and that the result is usable by some audience.  To build the product, I'd advise him to leverage AI the same way we used to leverage stackoverflow.  Once he ships an MVP, he can include it on his resume, but he needs to continue to iterate on it.\n\nIf he lands a eng-adjacent role, he needs to stay there for 2 years at least to avoid being labeled as a job-hopper.  Keep working on the side project, or kick off a new one.  Automate tasks at work with and without AI.\n\nDid I miss anything, or is anything above way off base?  I don't want to scare the kid, but at the same time, this market is horrendous for seniors...I can't imagine having nothing but coursework on my resume right now.",

I have been looking into Pinterest recently and wanted to know if anyone currently works there or has worked there in the past.\n\n\nI was hoping someone could help answer the following questions:\n\n\n1. What is the company culture like overall? Is it generally positive, or is there a sense of pressure, similar to the rest of the tech industry (broadly)?\n\n\n2. What does remote work feel like? Pinterest has positioned itself as a remote-first company. Does the culture reflect that, or is it difficult to progress in and feel connected in your career?\n\n\n3. In general, what is the compensation like? I am looking to come in as a senior (I have 8 YoE). Are there annual bonuses? Merit increases? Yearly stock refreshers?\n\n\n4. What is the leadership like? Do you get a sense that the company has a bright future, with clear goals?\n\n\n5. What are the benefits like? Is there unlimited PTO? Is the insurance good? For those with a family or planning to start a family, are family benefits worthwhile?\n\n\nThanks so much ahead of time! I hope to connect with someone in the community. Have a great week, everyone.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This isn’t a CS career question, but this subreddit is full of smart minds (please suggest another sub if there’s somewhere else to take this)!  I’m about 10 years into my engineering career; self-taught and came into Disney as a senior mobile engineer, then left after five years to join a big tech.  I came into big tech at a pretty high level role for an IC, which sometimes gets into my head that I have imposter syndrome.\n\nAny job I’ve ever had in tech, I’ve been a high performer.  I got promoted at Disney after three months, highly unlikely because I’m any more skilled than anyone else (I’m definitely not), but probably I spent a weekend on a high-impact side project that was fun and had cross-functional impact, and I’m a good communicator.  I sort of coasted there, but big tech has been a gut punch.\n\nI’m 6 months into my role at big tech and was rated as an underperformer.  Given that I came in at a high level, I have no doubt the expectations were high, but I think I’m doing my best.  I say yes to a lot (often a curse), take on whatever is asked of me, and try to push through learning complex systems and very frequent uncertainty of what I should be doing every day.  I work with smart and very helpful people, but when I hit a technical glitch (often), rarely does anyone on my team have any solution that works, and I end up spending time finding more resources or trying to self-solve until I get it.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve ever been anything but a star performer.  I think I’m letting work for such a prestigious company get to me, but I also think I’m trusting colleagues to tell me where to focus each day and not delivering quickly at all because the systems are complex, ridden with issues, and while people try to help me, I don’t genuinely feel like I’m getting a lot of help or even know what questions to ask until I hit a problem.\n\nHas anyone else ever dealt with this?  I know this is nuanced, but it’s causing me serious anxiety.",

        "author": "paynoattn",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**Original text:**  \nWas interviewing a candidate today, she is from India (not my choice) - EDIT: SEE BELOW FOR WHAT I MEANT HERE. She has solid experience 5 years. We're trying to fill a full stack .net and angular role (once again, not my choice). We had three sessions - get to know you, framework and language knowledge, and then LC easy (13 - Roman numeral to integer) with screen sharing.  She seems really stiff and nervous, but literally answers every question 100% accurately.\n\nFor the knowledge section it would usually take her a couple stabs and seconds of silence to get to the right / correct answer.\n\nMe: \"What is the best data structure for storing 10 million records in memory?\" Her: \"A list or array but for that many records I think you should use a dictionary.\"  \nMe: \"How would you handle a sql query that takes 30 seconds to return?\"  \nHer: \"blah blah blah, pagination, blah blah blah.\" (in a follow up questions she finally got to indexes\"  \nMe: \"What's SOLID\"  \nHer: \\*literally lists of the entire acronym correctly with what it means\\*\n\nI'm really skeptical at this point she either has notes, or is using chatgpt on another monitor. I'm personally fine with this, because I find it pretty easy to sus out and honestly only do this section because it's required by our HR department (I told them I wanted to do a single 2 hour long session with two LCs and a live project collaboration and skip the knowledge check and they were like \"no, that's not how we do it.\" >(ভ⤙ ভ \")<).\n\nThen we get to the LC. I share her a fiddle with the LC and tell her can use Visual Studio, or VS Code, or the fiddle - up to her. I tell her getting the solution isn't the important part - being able to explain her logic and thought process is. She then stumbles around with Visual Studio for like 3 minutes trying to create a solution, then switches to VS code - copies the fiddle into a FUCKING JAVASCRIPT FILE AND PROCEEDS TO RAW DOG THE C# WITHOUT SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING IN A JAVASCRIPT FILE. IN COMPLETE AWKWARD SILENCE TOO lol. I am floored. Is this cheating? Is she that nervous?\n\nBut the problem with the cheating scenario is I can see her working through the problem like I would. I.e. first create a method to iterate the string and break it into chars, then a method where she used a switch to get the int value, then she put the check for the previous char is less than in a static method, etc.\n\nAt the end, once again in complete fucking silence, she just dumps her javascript c# bastard child into the fiddle, runs it and gets the correct answer. I am so speechless at this. I ask her to explain her solution, which she does a decent job at and explains the business logic pretty well, then we drop from the interview.\n\nI use this same LC easy for pretty much every interview, and I literally have never seen such unhinged behavior in my life. My gut is telling me she just hates interviewing, but is secretly an interviewing chad and has done a TON of prep - but I also am out of the interviewee game - I haven't interviewed for a position since before COVID. Tell me, fellow gamers, is the cheating tech that good that it will tell you specifically how to fake reasoning out a solution? Or is it also giving nervousness / awkardness to you guys?\n\n**Edit**: I am leaving the original post body as to not receive criticism of secrecy. In my statement about the interviewee, I say \"*she is from India (not my choice)*\". What I meant by this is to say, I have no control over this decision - and to show that simplistic suggestions as \"just interview in person,\" won't work. Yes my company has an office in India that they could interview at, but there is nobody on my team or my boss' team that could do that for us. All five of my team leads are in N / S America. We do have employees on my team there, but they are all mid level. This is a senior role. I have in the past asked for support from other teams for this, but have been either ignored or told there isn't resources to support it.\n\nI personally fully support companies hiring everywhere in the world and employees being able to work everywhere in the world, at a good salary with no exploitation and nobody losing their jobs to accomplish this. Some of the best engineers I have ever worked with are Indian, both from collaborating across the world or as H1B on the path to green card and citizenship in the US. 🇮🇳 ❤️\n\nAlso, for this role, we cannot hire anywhere but in India as it is part of our companies expense budget for India. We are filling an open role from somebody who was already in India when I became manager of the team, who left some time ago. I can't go more into detail due to HR/Compliance reasons.\n\nI could have explained all of this above, yes, but I was already writing a really long post and wanted to just get to the point without detracting from it with a long winded explanation nobody could have wanted. Well here is the long winded explanation several have asked for.\n\nIf you felt my comments about the interviewees ethnicity or national origin were offensive or mean - I apologize.\n\nAlso for those that are wondering why I said (*once again, not my choice*) for .net / angular - yeah I fucking hate that shit. Eat 💩 angular team and microsoft. /s - .net isnt as bad as PHP. angular isnt as bad as jquery was. \\*\\*shudders\\*\\*",

        "content": "I’m an early-career frontend developer, and I’ve been at my first job (a startup) for about 10 months now.\n\nFirst, I was assigned to work on a product that had quite a few bad practices - not type-safe, over a thousand TypeScript/linter errors, and a huge 10k+ LOC table component. With a lot of effort from me and my teammate, we managed to make it somewhat decent and easier to work with.\n\nApparently because I did a good job, I was thrown into another project that was built in-house, and honestly, I’m feeling extremely frustrated because it’s the same story all over again - the codebase is even harder to work with. Some examples:\n\n* Massive 2k+ LOC React components\n* Misuse of Context API for basically everything\n* Features tightly coupled, imagine component with 10+ useEffects, sockets, table column definitions, 10 level deep ternary operators, and subtle differences depending on \"mode\" - reused like 20 times throughout the app, used to display completely different entities.\n* Testing and modularization are basically nonexistent\n* Unclear dependencies (Entity info modal depends on a 2k LOC Loads context and on a common state that is consumed by chat modal, which depends on a 2k LOC NewLoads context, etc...)\n* This project is built on NextJS + It has a separate node backend. Why? Good question.\n\nHonestly, it’s just incredibly bad.\n\nI also position myself as a full-stack developer, so I took some tasks on the backend side - same story:\n\n* 8k+ LOC controllers mixing validation, service, and repository logic\n* Error handling? `res.status(500).json({ msg: \"Internal server error\" })` \\- lol\n* Not using prepared statements (hello SQLi)\n* No pagination in a logistics app\n* Why assign some common processed data into a shared variable, when you can just copy and paste the processing part.\n* Copy-pasted logic with zero abstraction\n* Lots of inconsistencies (e.g., phone field required in some places, optional in others)\n* No tests and probably untestable - ZERO classes in a 100k LOC codebase\n\nSo, honestly, I am extremely frustrated. It feels like everything I learned about writing maintainable code is being wasted.\n\nI’m considering leaving for a healthier codebase, but since this is my first job and I don’t have a formal CS degree, I’m worried about how it’ll look. I want to grow my skills, especially in maintainable React development, but I don’t want to feel stuck in this mess forever.\n\nSo my questions:\n\n1. Is it reasonable to leave a first job after 10 months because the code is unmaintainable?\n2. How do I frame this experience positively in interviews?\n3. Any tips for surviving in such a codebase?\n\n  \nEdit: Is the industry really in such bad shape? How come software engineers are paid so well when so many overlook even the basics?",

Wanted to ask if you guys think the salary increase + FAANG on my resume is worth the move.",

On the other hand, Java is old and there is alot of jobs for it CURRENTLY and it has a huge community and is used basically everywhere.

I’m a rising sophomore at a community college in Eastside Seattle, working toward a BS in CS. This will be my third undergrad degree (Kinesiology and Biology, one from a military academy with significant networking benefits). Due to VA and UW policies, I am ineligible to attend UW for CS, either through their undergraduate or bridge-to-master’s program, which would have allowed me to skip another bachelor’s degree. My only option is a third undergrad from another school.\n\nMy concern is employment after graduation. The entry-level CS job market looks tight, and last year I struck out on internships (only Amazon’s veterans program responded, but I was too early in my degree).\n\n1. I enjoy coding and hope to stay in the field.\n\n1. I’m open to CS-adjacent paths (IT, cybersecurity, data science, computer engineering, etc) if prospects are better.\n\n1. Thanks to the VA, I’m financially stable (enough) and could go straight into a master’s after my undergrad if that’s the wiser move.\n\nMain Question: Given today’s market, what’s the most realistic and sustainable path forward for someone in my position?\n\nBonus Question: What should I be doing right now in addition to attending classes to help my prospects?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice.",

I also had 3 internships during college as a software engineer.\n\nI can’t help but feeling I am not good at my job and that I chose the wrong career path.  I’ve already been at the company for a year and just don’t feel up to par with other SWE 1s who started around the same time.\n\nI’m not sure for how long should I stick with software engineering to know if I am actually not meant for this career?\n\nWhat are some career paths that I can pivot to when my resume experience is solely software engineering?  I was considering product management but given the competitive market I am not sure they would take someone with no previous internships in the field.  I also can’t help but wondering if I do end up landing a different role like a PM, what if I’m not good at that either.\n\nIf anyone has been in the same boat I’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, thank you 🙏",

So I’ve been working the power platform for 2 years but outside my company, it doesn’t pay well and while there is demand, it’s a tool part of one’s’ skillset, not the whole skillset. Plus it’s oversaturated. I don’t want to do it anymore but in the meantime, I’ve been doing very technical business analyst and data analyst tasks. I was thinking I could pivot myself to one of these at a new company. But would I get hired? And if so, would I have to be entry level?

I've indicated that I'm very interested in the position, however I'm worried I may have been a bit too eager in showing my interest as the salary of the position wasn't disclosed, would require that I change from full-remote to hybrid, and the company is generally known for giving lackluster at best raises/promotions. I'm already on the lower end of the payscale for my current role, so I have a feeling they're going to try lowballing me on the salary extra hard for the new position by just offering like a 15% bump (for reference the low end of the band for the new role in my area on glassdoor/indeed is more like a 40-50% bump compared to my current salary), which I feel wouldn't be worth it at all when taking into account the additional responsibilities, costs of commuting, and degraded work/life balance. Assuming that the company does lowball me and isn't willing to budge, how would you guys recommend I handle things? Respectfully decline the position despite previously showing great interest in it and take this as a sign to start looking for a new position, or just grit my teeth and accept the lowball offer and try to leverage the new title to get a new job somewhere offering a salary and benefits more in line with what appears to be industry standard after 3-6 months in the new role?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Many of the questions are very complex and detailed at interviews because they think my dates of employment consist of experience, when mostly we were just building our own projects and watching Udemy courses as all the new projects that were supposed to be coming were ones where the client backed out, or went with another firm because we didn't have anyone with 8 years experience on staff.  Me and several others got on projects that lasted 2-4 weeks because our managers mislead our clients into thinking we were senior level and we told them we weren't when we started working and weren't as efficient as they expected us to be. \n\nSo, there are questions like explain how you used JIRA to collaborate and work more effectively as a team or a time where you used Spring Boot to increase productivity and enhance a service.   I've used both those tools, but coming up with such details of how I improved a legacy system with spring boot or more than just describing how JIRA works, I don't really have anything else to say.  It's just that I've been mostly working on coding skills and creating some services with the limitations of what I can do in a short time as only one person, and I can't give them the answers they want.  \n\nAm I supposed to lie and repeat other people's answers I find on the internet or is there a way to actually get this level of agile experience without working on an agile team first for long enough.  \n\nOne of those projects over the 3 months was a 2 month project where most of the time we were not doing anything because the client poorly planned the teams and 7 of us on a team that really only needed about 2 people with only a few services and very few bugs coming through on them.  \n\nAre there any teams that are actually designing something new or re-creating services requiring actual coding skills instead of just fixing minor bugs that take about 5 minutes or migrating from something like Maven to Gradle?  It seems all we've ever done is busy work on systems that were outdated and didn't learn anything as all we did was updated packages and fixed vulnerabilities that anyone can do. ",

Creating boring tasks every day is simply exhausting for me. I do not change jobs because in almost every software house you do the same thing, and I also don’t want to go through 10 steps of recruitment.\n\nI would gladly work on something innovative, even for less money. The problem is that such positions are only for people with 15+ years of experience, even if the work does not really require it. Either those people were smarter at convincing recruiters, or because of huge competition companies can now hire very experienced developers for the same salary as mid-level ones.\nI think I would probably fit well in a startup. I could even work 16 hours a day, but I would expect an interesting project and a fair salary.\n\n\nIf not innovative projects, then at least some competition for monopolies (like Adobe, or browsers based on engines other than Chromium or Firefox). But it is also very hard to get into such projects.\n\nIt looks like if I do not find a job for similar money (basically scraps, but still a bit more than McDonald’s and with home office), in another industry, then I will not have a happy career as a developer, even if I have enough skills.\n\nOf course, I could try to create my own product and become a founder. But then you need money for marketing — because even if the software is open source, without promotion nobody will hear about it, and there will be no money. This means hunger, and then going back to software houses to build CRUDs again.\n\nAnd this is exactly how I feel: like a chained dog that never goes for a walk, only sits tied up and howls at night. Except the dog at least does not have to work in scrum sprints, pressed by non-technical managers. \n\n\n*yes I used Ai, but just for clarity cuz I write things chaotically. ",

Furthermore, before reading this, some might say \"did you ask for help\", I did ask for help, I met them face-to-face for help, you can say that I'm borderline stalking them right now. The answer I got is \"do some (more) research\" LOL.\n\nI'm an intern, on week 2 - this week - today, I was given this absolutely questionable codebase, the BE server returns from boolean to string to array to json value, you never know what value type it will return and it's a nightmare to navigate because there is no documentation, there is nothing, the only way you gonna know is to print the result out. There is a log system, EVERYTHING is log in ONE PLACE, the tiniest thing is also logged, 1 request = a massive file containing every single log possible.\n\nFurthermore, each request goes through 2 BE, 1 is the BE server and the other is a low-code platform server BE, and ts suck nuts, because this low-code platform has a request limit and the server is running on an unstable docker image so when either of these thing crashes, you don't know which thing crashed because the person who coded this before me thought it was a good idea to return EVERY SINGLE ERRORS MESSAGE AS ONE and there is no try-catch block.\n\nOh yeah, btw, I'm just an intern but I control the entire live production server of this project, this project doesn't have a development environment, I was tasked to research the dev environment + on top of maintaining abomination codebase + on top of developing new feature, I can literally use \\`rm -rf\\` this entire server.\n\nSo, today I was asked to fix a core function of the BE server, this BE server was created solely for this function. I was able to mitigate it by creating more sessions but this approach was rejected because all sessions have been approved by the client superiors and there is no way to change it and I CAN'T CHANGE THE FUNCTION to fix this because the function is \"working correctly\" based on the customer requirements by my lead, mind you guys although I am alone on this project, I do not received any documentations not even the customer/client requirements.\n\nOh and this job is below minimum wage in my country, I made triple being at mcdonald \n\nAfter the synopsis, I have a few questions or I need advices:\n\n1. Should I quit? Because I do have a better option which is an official employee title and a museum gig which I like\n\n2. If I don't quit? Where should I even start because while I have access to a lot of things, I don't have access to other things",

        "content": "This situation started when my manager randomly re-assigned a project I was working on to someone else. She didn't tell me why or what this meant for me. I wrote up a big document on how to do this, she assigned me tickets from there, but someone else was listed as the lead. I talked to him, and it turned out he had no idea he was the lead of this project. I thought she might have done this simply because she prefers working with this guy, but now it seemed solely vindictive if I was still going to be doing all the work\n\nSo, I reached out to my manager trying to get clarity on what my role in this project was. She got defensive, deflected, asked leading questions, but never truly answered my one simple question: am I supposed to be working on this project or not? If I am, what of the document I wrote, is it still how we're doing it? If I am doing *all* the work, why'd you assign someone else as the lead? She got really frustrated and then eventually threatened to PIP me, so I disengaged.\n\nI went to my skip and talked to him, showing him the conversations. He seemed on my side for this conversation. Since then, I noticed that she had a lot of meetings with him. He told me that if I had conflict with her, I should post it in a public channel. I started doing this when she would nitpick my pull requests endlessly\n\nFor example, I had a storybook instance where I was displaying all the components. She would constantly tell me to change stories, add stories, change how storybook works, etc. Her comments were vague, like \"make it match design\". Neither me nor the lead designer could tell what she was talking about. When confronted about how it \"doesn't match design\", she'd kinda react like \"I'm not telling 🤭\", so I guess I concluded that she was just wasting my time on purpose\n\nSo, I posted in the public channel, which then caused her to come into the thread and act very inappropriately. So much so, I got texts from people (privately) who work there like \"wow what did you do to piss her off???\". At the end, she said to get into a huddle with her, but my skip joined before me. I got in and my skip basically said \"dw we got it figured out\" and I looked at my PR and it was approved\n\nFor a while, she backed off. However, recently I was given a big task to replace every button component across every app with the one from the component library (the project I mentioned before). I did all this, then she left a comment how she didn't like how the button worked. She left no details. She blocked the review and basically said \"button is awkward, go back to the drawing board\". I felt this was solely done to delay me. The button was literally just applying styles to a library (@headlessui/react)\n\nI went back and found the PR where I implemented the one decision she complained about. Not only was it documented in the PR itself, but it had unit tests, comments, and live documentation detailing how it works. It was merged two weeks ago, and she approved it. At this point, I noticed even my coworkers were coming to my defense and calling her unreasonable in the PR\n\nI sent this to my skip and mentioned that I really think I'm being set up for failure here. I showed this PR, but also showed that every PR I submitted was nitpicked endlessly by her while approved by others much quicker. I also showed that she seemed to *only* do this with me, as she approved other team mates PRs quickly\n\nAt this point I'm really lost as to what to do. There is no HR department at my company. There's no team I can transfer to. I'm considering asking my skip to do *anything* to just get me off of her team even if it means becoming a backend engineer at this point. I just can't work with her\n\nWhat can I do in this situation?",

I'm just wondering; how the hell do you job search while actively employed?\n\nObviously people job hop in this industry a lot, how?\n\nMy current job is publicly listed on my LinkedIn / GitHub:\n\n- What if the companies i'm applying to see i'm employed and looking for a new job at the same time?\n\n- What if my current boss finds out? How do i schedule interviews, obviously i can only do them after 4pm when i'm done with my current job?\n\n- What do i do if they ask am i currently employed, does it seem bad i'm actively looking for work while employed?\n\n- What if they want a final in-person interview which i can't do since i'm supposed to be at work?\n\nI'm so confused guys how do people this lol it seems crazy",

        "content": "I've been developing software professionally for over 7 years now. I'm a certified AWS Solutions Architect and have designed and developed several full stack applications from the ground up. I've been feeling burnt out in my field for the last couple of years, and realized that I've always had a passion for robotics, but never got into it professionally as life took me down the full stack direction. I'm now determined to transition into robotics, even if it means going back to school for a masters, but I'm looking into other options to hopefully save time and money while still providing reasonable opportunities for me to land a job in the field. I have some experience with arduinos and pis, but I'm pretty much a beginner in this space.\n\nI came across this course https://www.theconstruct.ai/robotics-developer/ which looks promising if it could help me get a solid internship with a company, but was curious if others had recommendations for making this jump. I'm at the point where I'm planning to leave my current position in about 6 months and work on getting the needed education/portfolio full time until I land a new position. I want to fully commit to this rather than slowly transition over the course of a couple years. \n\nWith that being said, what are some options for transitioning into robotics as a career for someone who is already working in software? Anyone here working in robotics now that was previously full stack? Would love to hear any insights on this.",
