A long-running pipeline was left active overnight. It was… let’s say, *less than optimal* in design and ended up consuming an absurd amount of resources.\n\nNow the entire tenant is locked. No deployments. No pipeline runs. No changes. Nothing.\n\nThe team is on the $8K/month plan, but since the entire annual quota has been burned through in just a few months, the only option to regain functionality before the next reset (in \\~2 weeks) is upgrading to the $20K/month Enterprise tier.\n\nTo make things more exciting, the deadline for delivering a production-ready Fabric setup is tomorrow. So yeah — blocked, under pressure, and paying thousands for a frozen environment.\n\nIronically, version control and proper testing processes were proposed weeks ago but were brushed off in favor of moving quickly and keeping things “lightweight.”\n\nThe dream was Spark magic, ChatGPT-powered pipelines, and effortless deployment.  \nThe reality? Burned-out capacity, missed deadlines, and a very expensive cloud paperweight.\n\nAnd now someone’s spending their day untangling this mess — armed with nothing but regret and a silent *“I told you so.”*",

        "content": "Hey I'm doing one of these sankey charts to show visualize my job search this year. I have 5 YOE working at a startup and was looking for a bigger, more stable company focused on a mature product/platform. I tried applying to a bunch of places at the end of last year, but hiring had already slowed down. At the beginning of this year I found a bunch of applications to remote companies on LinkedIn that seemed interesting and applied. I knew it'd be a pretty big longshot to get interviews, yet I felt confident enough having some experience under my belt. I believe I started applying at the end of January and finally landed a role at the end of March.\n\nI definitely have been fortunate to not need to submit hundreds of applications here, and I don't really have any specific advice on how to get offers other than being likable and competent (even when doing leetcode-style questions). I guess my one piece of advice is to apply to companies that you feel have you build good conversational rapport with, people that seem nice, and genuinely make you interested. Also say no to 4 hour interviews, those suck and I always bomb them. Often the kind of people you meet in these gauntlets are up to luck too so don't beat yourself up about getting filtered.\n\nIf anyone has questions I'd be happy to try and answer, but honestly I'm just another data engineer who feels like they got lucky.

The idea came from how cloud-expensive tools like Apache Flink can get when dealing with high-throughput streams.\n\nThe initial version provides:\n\n- continuous sliding window query processing (not batch)\n- a usable SQL interface\n- plugin-based Input/Output for flexibility\n\nIt’s completely free. Income from support and extra features down the road if this is actually useful.\n\n---\n\nPerformance so far:\n\n- 1k+ stream queries/sec on an AWS t4g.nano instance (AWS price \\~$3/month)\n- 800k+ q/sec on an AWS c8g.large instance. That's \\~1000x cheaper than AWS Managed Flink for similar throughput.\n\n---\n\nNow the big question:\n\nDoes this solve a real problem for enough folks out there? (We're thinking logs, cybersecurity, algo-trading, gaming, telemetry).  \n\nWorth pursuing or just a niche rabbit hole?

        "author": "LinasData",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "The original data chaos actually started *before* spreadsheets were common. In the pre-ERP days, most business systems were siloed—HR, finance, sales, you name it—all running on their own. To report on anything meaningful, you had to extract data from each system, often manually. These extracts were pulled at different times, using different rules, and then stitched togethe. The result? Data quality issues. And to make matters worse, people were running these reports directly against transactional databases—systems that were supposed to be optimized for speed and reliability, not analytics. The reporting load bogged them down.\n\nThe problem was so painful for the businesses, so around the late 1980s, a few forward-thinking folks—most famously Bill Inmon—proposed a better way: a data warehouse.\n\nTo make matter even worse, in the late ’00s every department had its own spreadsheet empire. Finance had one version of “the truth,” Sales had another, and Marketing were inventing their own metrics. People would walk into meetings with totally different numbers for the same KPI.\n\nThe spreadsheet party had turned into a data chaos rave. There was no lineage, no source of truth—just lots of tab-switching and passive-aggressive email threads. It wasn’t just annoying—it was a risk. Businesses were making big calls on bad data. So data warehousing became common practice!\n\nMore about it: [https://www.corgineering.com/blog/How-Data-Warehouses-Were-Created](https://www.corgineering.com/blog/How-Data-Warehouses-Were-Created)\n\n  \nP.S.

And aren't there easy solutions to develop locally?\n\nMy use case is pretty simple and generic. Also, not too speed-intensive. We are just trying to migrate to a horizontally-scalable processing tool to deal with our sporadic larger-than-memory data, not having to impose low data size limits on our application. We have done what we could with Polars for the past two years to keep everything light but our need for a flexible and bullet proof tool is clear now, and it seems we can't keep running from distributed alternatives.\n\nDask seems like a much easier alternative, but we also worry about integration with different languages and technologies, and Dask is pretty tied to Python. Another component of our backend is written in Elixir, which still does not have a Spark API, but there is [a little hope](https://github.com/elixir-explorer/explorer#:~:text=or%20even%20Spark%20dataframes), so Spark seems more democratic.",

        "author": "trianglesteve",

        "content": "This is a broader modeling question, but my use case is specifically for Power BI. I've got a Power BI semantic model that I'm trying to minimize the memory impact on the tenant capacity. The company is cheaping out and only wants the bare minimum capacity in PBI and we're already hitting the capacity limits regularly. \n\nThe model itself is already in star schema format and I've optimized the tables/views on the database side to refresh the dataset quick enough, but the problem comes when users interact with the report and the model is loaded into the limited memory we have available in the tenant. \n\nOne thing I could do to further optimize for memory in the dataset is chain the 2 main fact tables together, which I know breaks some of Kimball's modeling rules. However, one of them is a naturally related higher grain (think order detail/order header) I could reduce the size of the detail table by relating it directly to the higher grain header table and remove the surrogate keys that could instead be passed down by the header table. \n\nIn theory this could reduce the memory footprint (I'm estimating by maybe 25-30%) at a potential small cost in terms of calculating some measures at the lowest grain. \n\nDoes it ever make sense to bend or break the modeling rules? Would this be a good case for it?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThere are lots of great ideas here! Sounds like there are times to break the rules when you understand what it’ll mean (if you don’t hear back from me I’m being held against my will by the Kimball secret police). I’ll test it out and see exactly how much memory I can save on the chained fact tables and test visual/measure performance between the two models.\n\nI’ll work with the customers and see where there may be opportunities to aggregate and exactly which fields need to be filterable to the lowest grain, and I will see if there’s a chance leadership will budge on their cheap budget, I appreciate all the feedback!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "So, I'm currently working on a project (my first) to create a scalable data platform for a company. The whole thing structured around AWS, initially using DMS to migrate PostgreSQL data to S3 in parquet format (this is our raw datalake). Then using Glue jobs to read this data and create Iceberg tables which would be used in Athena queries and Quicksight. I've got a working Glue script for reading this data and perform upsert operations. Okay so now that I've given a bit of context of what I'm trying to do, let me tell you my problem.  \nThe client wants me to schedule this job to run every 15min or so for staging and most probably every hour for production. The data in the raw datalake is partitioned by date (for example: s3bucket/table\\_name/2025/04/10/file.parquet). Now that I have to run this job every 15 min or so I'm not sure how to keep track of the files that have been processed and which haven't. Currently my script finds the current time and modifies the read command to use just the folder for the current date. But still, this means that I'll be reading all the files in the folder (processed already or not) every time the job runs during the day.   \nI've looked around and found that using DynamoDB for keeping track of the files would be my best option but also found something related to Iceberg metadata files that could help me with this. I'm leaning towards the Iceberg option as I wanna make use of all its features but have too little information regarding this to implement. would absolutely appreciate it if someone could help me out with this.  \nHas anyone worked with Iceberg in this matter? and if the iceberg solution isn't usable, could someone help me out with how to implement the DynamoDB way.",

        "author": "No-Exam2934",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey, I think there are better use cases for event sourcing.  \n  \nEvent sourcing is an architecture where you capture every change in your system as an immutable event, rather than just storing the latest state. Instead of only knowing what your data looks like now, you keep a full history of how it got there. In a simple crud app that would mean that every deleted, updated, and created entry is stored in your event source, that way when you replay your events you can recreate the state that the application was in at any given time.\n\nMost developers see event sourcing as a kind of technical safety net: - Recovering from failures - Rebuilding corrupted read models - Auditability\n\nSurviving schema changes without too much pain\n\nAnd fair enough, replaying your event stream often feels like a stressful situation. Something broke, you need to fix it, and you’re crossing your fingers hoping everything rebuilds cleanly.\n\nWhat if replaying your event history wasn’t just for emergencies? What if it was a normal, everyday part of building your system?\n\nInstead of treating replay as a recovery mechanism, you treat it as a development tool — something you use to evolve your data models, improve your logic, and shape new views of your data over time. More excitingly, it means you can derive entirely new schemas from your event history whenever your needs change.\n\nYour database stops being the single source of truth and instead becomes what it was always meant to be: a fast, convenient cache for your data, not the place where all your logic and assumptions are locked in.\n\nWith a full event history, you’re free to experiment with new read models, adapt your data structures without fear, and shape your data exactly to fit new purposes — like enriching fields, backfilling values, or building dedicated models for AI consumption. Replay becomes not about fixing what broke, but about continuously improving what you’ve built.\n\nAnd this has big implications — especially when it comes to AI and MCP Servers.\n\nMost application databases aren’t built for natural language querying or AI-powered insights. Their schemas are designed for transactions, not for understanding. Data is spread across normalized tables, with relationships and assumptions baked deeply into the structure.\n\nBut when you treat your event history as the source of truth, you can replay your events into purpose-built read models, specifically structured for AI consumption.\n\nNeed flat, denormalized tables for efficient semantic search? Done. Want to create a user-centric view with pre-joined context for better prompts? Easy. You’re no longer limited by your application’s schema — you shape your data to fit exactly how your AI needs to consume it.\n\nAnd here’s where it gets really interesting: AI itself can help you explore your data history and discover what’s valuable.\n\nInstead of guessing which fields to include, you can use AI to interrogate your raw events, spot gaps, surface patterns, and guide you in designing smarter read models. It’s a feedback loop: your AI doesn’t just query your data — it helps you shape it.\n\nSo instead of forcing your AI to wrestle with your transactional tables, you give it clean, dedicated models optimized for discovery, reasoning, and insight.\n\nAnd the best part? You can keep iterating. As your AI use cases evolve, you simply adjust your flows and replay your events to reshape your models — no migrations, no backfills, no re-engineering.",

One common issue we’re facing is that the **country names in these datasets are not standardized**. For example, we may encounter entries like **\"Burma\" instead of \"Myanmar\"**, or **\"Islamic Republic of Iran\" instead of \"Iran\"**.\n\nMy initial approach was to extract all unique country name variations and map them to a list of standard country names using logic such as CASE WHEN conditions or basic string-matching techniques.\n\nHowever, my manager has suggested we leverage **AI/LLM-based models** to automate the mapping of these country names to a standardized list to handle new query points as well. \n\nI have a couple of concerns and would appreciate your thoughts:\n\n1. **Is using AI/LLMs a suitable approach for this problem?**\n2. **Can LLMs be fully reliable in these mappings, or is there a risk of incorrect matches?**\n3. I was considering implementing a **feedback pipeline** that highlights any newly encountered or unmapped country names during data ingestion so we can review and incorporate logic to handle them in the code over time. Would this be a better or complementary solution?\n4. Please suggest if there is some better approach.\n\nLooking forward to your insights!",

Is my only choice to just manually inspect all the different tables to find which have the kind of column I need? Note here that there wasn't even a basic normalisation of column names enforced (\"phone_num\", \"phone\", \"tel\", \"phone_number\" etc) and some of this data is already in OBT form with some containing up to a hundred sparsely populated columns.\n\nDo I apply fuzzy matching to identify source columns? Use an LLM to build massive mapping dictionaries? What are some approaches or methods I should consider when tackling this so I'm not stuck scrolling through infinite print outs? There is a metadata catalogue with some columns having been given tags to identify its content, but these aren't consistent and also have high cardinality.\n\nFrom the business perspective, they want completeness, so I can't strategically pick which tables to use and ignore the rest.

I wanted to share my proposed architecture and get your insights.\n\n1. The core components are: **Kafka:** Serving as the central nervous system for ingesting a massive amount of data reliably.\n2. **Go Processor:** A consumer application written in Go, placed directly after Kafka, to perform initial, low-latency processing and filtering of the incoming data.\n3. **Intermediate Queue (Redis Streams/NATS JetStream):** To decouple the low-latency processing from the potentially slower analytics and to provide buffering for data that needs further analysis.\n4. **Analytics Consumer:** Responsible for the more intensive analytical tasks on the filtered data from the queue.\n5. **WebSockets:** For pushing the processed insights to a frontend in real-time.\n\nThe idea is to leverage Kafka's throughput capabilities while using Go for quick initial processing. The queue acts as a buffer and allows us to be selective about the data sent for deeper analytics. Finally, WebSockets provide the real-time link to the user.\n\nI built this keeping in mind these three principles\n\n* **Separation of Concerns:** Each component has a specific responsibility.\n* **Scalability:** Kafka handles ingestion, and individual consumers can be scaled independently.\n* **Resilience:** The queue helps decouple processing stages.\n\nHas anyone implemented a similar architecture?

I will receive several parsed addresses from this candidate as Washington is vague. What is the best practice in such cases? As the google api won’t return a single result, what can i do?\n\n- My addresses are from all around the world, do you know if google api can handle the whole world?

        "content": "Hello! I work on a small team and we ingest a bunch of event data (\"beacons\") go from nginx -> flume -> kafka. I think this is fairly \"normal\" stuff (?).\n\nWe would like be able to send a very small subset of these messages to a lower environment so that we can compare the output of a data pipeline. We need to have some sort of filtering logic, e.g. if the message looks like `{cool: true, machineId: \"abcd\"}`, we want to send all messages where `machineId` == `abcd` to this other environment.\n\nI'm guessing there are a million ways we could do this, e.g. we could start this at the Flume level, but in my head it seems like it would be \"nice\" (though I can't exactly put my finger on why) to do this via Kafka, e.g. through Topics.\n\nI'm looking for some advice / guidance on an efficient way to do this. \n\nOne specific technology I'm aware of (but have no experience with!) is MirrorMaker. The problem I have with this (along with pretty much any solution if I'm honest) is that it is difficult for me to easily reason about or test out. So I'm hoping for some guidance before I invest a bunch of time trying to figure out how to actually test / implement something. Looking at the documentation (I can find easily!) I don't see any options for the type of filtering I'm talking about either which requires, at least, basic string matching on the actual contents of the message.\n\nThanks very much for your time!",

Discover the `tpch` catalog\n2. Find the `tiny` schema and `customer` table\n3. Examine the table schema to find the `mktsegment` and `acctbal` columns\n4. Execute the query: `SELECT mktsegment, AVG(acctbal) as avg_balance FROM tpch.tiny.customer GROUP BY mktsegment ORDER BY avg_balance DESC`\n5. Return the formatted results\n\n# Getting Started\n\n1. Download the pre-built binary for your platform from [releases page](https://github.com/tuannvm/mcp-trino/releases)\n2. Configure it to connect to your Trino server\n3. Add it to your AI client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)\n4. Start querying your data through natural language!\n\n# Why I Built This\n\nAs both a Trino user and an AI enthusiast, I wanted to break down the barrier between natural language and data queries. This lets business users leverage Trino's power through AI interfaces without needing to write SQL from scratch.\n\n# Looking for Contributors\n\nThis is just the start! I'd love to hear your feedback and welcome contributions. Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tuannvm/mcp-trino) for more details, examples, and documentation.\n\nWhat data questions would you ask your AI assistant if it could query your Trino clusters?",

Go the dbt freshness route and add an `updated_at` timestamp column to each row in the model.  Then find the `MAX` of that in the last 7 days (or just be a little sloppy at get timestamp from newest partition and be OK with unnecessarily reloading a partition now and then.)\n2. Create a new table that is a **transaction log of the model runs**.  Log a start and end timestamp in there and use that very small table to get a last run timestamp.\n3. Look at `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS` on the incremental model (not the source).  Use the `MAX` of that to determine the last time it was run.  I'm worried this could be updated in other ways and cause us to skip source data.\n4. Dig it out of `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`.  Though I'm not sure it would contain what I need.\n5. Keep loading 7 days on each run but throttle it with a freshness check so it only happens X times per X.\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "Hello,\nI’m facing a philosophical question at work and I can’t find an answer that would put my brain at ease. \n\nBasically we work with Databricks and Pyspark for ingestion and transformation.\n\nWe have a new data provider that sends crypted and zipped files to an s3 bucket. There are a couple of thousands of files (2 years of historic).\n\nWe wanted to use dataloader from databricks. It’s basically a spark stream that scans folders, finds the files that you never ingested (it keeps track in a table) and reads the new files only and write them.\nThe problem is that dataloader doesn’t handle encrypted and zipped files (json files inside).\n\nWe can’t unzip files permanently. \n\nMy coworker proposed that we use the autoloader to find the files (that it can do) and in that spark stream use the for each batch method to apply a lambda that does:\n- get the file name (current row)\n-decrypt and unzip\n-hash the files (to avoid duplicates in case of failure)\n-open the unzipped file using spark\n-save in the final table using spark \n\nI argued that it’s not the right place to do all that and since it’s not the use case of autoloader it’s not a good practice, he argues that spark is distributed and that’s the only thing we care since it allows us to do what we need quickly even though it’s hard to debug (and we need to pass the s3 credentials to each executor using the lambda…)\n\nI proposed a homemade solution which isn’t the most optimal, but it seems better and easier to maintain which is:\n- use boto paginator to find files\n- decrypt and unzip each file \n- write then json in the team bucket/folder\n-create a monitoring table in which we save the file name, hash, status (ok/ko) and exceptions if there are any\n\nHe argues that this is not efficient since it’ll only use one single node cluster and not parallelised. \n\nI never encountered such use case before and I’m kind of stuck, I read a lot of literature but everything seems very generic. \n\nEdit: we only receive 2 to 3 files daily per data feed (150mo per file on average) but we have 2 years of historical data which amounts to around 1000 files. So we need 1 run for all the historic then a daily run. \nEvery feed ingested is a class instantiation (a job on a cluster with a config) so it doesn’t matter if we have 10 feeds. \n\nEdit2: 1000 files roughly summed to 130go after unzipping. Not sure of average zip/json file though. \n\nWhat do you people think of this? Any advices ?\nThank you ",

We plan to use Power BI as our reporting tool, and all departments in the company will rely on it for analytics.\n\nThe challenge is that teams from different departments expect **the data to be fully related and ready** to use when building dashboards, minimizing the need for additional modeling. We’re struggling to determine the best approach to meet these expectations.\n\nWhat would you recommend?\n\nShould all dimensions and facts be pre-related in the data warehouse, even if it adds complexity?\n\nCreating separate data models in Power BI for different departments/use cases?\n\nHandling all relationships in the data warehouse and exposing them via curated datasets?\n\nShould we empower Power BI users to create their own data models, or enforce strict governance with documented relationships?\n\nThanks in advance for your insights!

I'm excited to dive into **ADF** and try out some new things.\n\nHere, you can see we have a copy data activity that transfers files from the source ADLS to the raw ADLS location. Then, we have a Lookup named **Lkp\\_archivepath** which retrieves values from the SQL server, known as the Metastore. This will get values such as **archive\\_path** and **archive\\_delete\\_flag** (typically it will be Y or N, and sometimes the parameter will be missing as well). After that, we have a copy activity that copies files from the source ADLS to the archive location. Now, I'm encountering an issue as I'm trying to introduce this archive delete flag concept.\n\nIf the **archive\\_delete\\_flag** is '**Y**', it should not delete the files from the source, but it should delete the files if the **archive\\_delete\\_flag** is '**N**', '' or NULL, depending on the Metastore values. How can I make this work?\n\nLooking forward to your suggestions, thanks!",

I need something that is going to support stateful stream processing, high-scalability, etc.\n\nWhile my organization does have Kubernetes knowledge, my upper management does not want effort to be spent on managing a K8s cluster. And they do not have high confidence in our current primary cloud provider's K8 cluster hosting experience.\n\nThe project I have right now is using cloud-native solutions for stateful stream processing without custom solutions for storing state, etc. Which I have warned is going to result in driving this project into the ground due to costs spent in prohibitively expensive cloud-provider-locked-in stream processing and batch processing solutions currently being used. Not to mention the terrible DX and poor test-ability of the currently used stateless stream processing solutions.\n\nThis whole idea of moving us to Apache Flink is starting to feel hopeless, so any advice would be much appreciated!",

However, I am looking to understand if a lakehouse like Databricks is the right solution for a product that primarily serves as a BI interface with a strict but flexible data security model. The ideal solution is one that:\n\n- Is intuitive to use for users who are not technical (assuming technical users can prepopulate dashboards)\n- Can easily, securely share data across workspaces (for example, consider Customer A and Customer B require isolation but want to share data at some point) \n- Can scale to accommodate storing and reporting on billions or trillions of relatively small events from something like RabbitMQ (maybe 10 string properties) over an 18 month period. I realize this is very dependent on size of the data, data transformation, and writing well optimized queries\n- Has flexible reporting and visualization capabilities\n- Is affordable for a smaller company to operate\n\nI've evaluated some popular solutions like Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, and other smaller tools like Metabase. Based on my research, it seems like Databricks is the perfect solution for these use cases, though it could be cost prohibitive. I just wanted to get a gut feel if I'm on the right track from people with much more experience than myself. Anything else I should consider?",

On one hand, I have a few industrial engineering projects: implementing new equipment to automate/optimize processes. \n\nOn the other hand: our team manages the Data pipelines, data models and power bis, including power apps, power automates and sap scripts. There are two of us in the team.\n\nWe use SQL with data from our softwares. We also use azure data explorer (sensors streaming equipment related data (temp, ph, flow rates, etc) \n\nOur tables are bloated. We have more than 60 PBIs. Our queries are confusing. Our data models have 50+ connections and 100+ DAX measures. Power queries have 15+ confusing steps. We don’t use data flows, instead each pbi queries the sql tables, and sometimes there’s difference in the queries. We also calculate kpis in different pbis, but because of these slight differences, we get inconsistent data. \n\nAlso, for some apps we can’t have access to the DB, so we have people manually downloading files and posting them to share point.\n\nI have a backlog of 96+ tasks and every one is taking me days, if not weeks. I’m really the only one that knows his way around a PBI, and I consider myself a beginner (like I said, less than a year of experience). \n\nI feel like I’m way over my head, just checking if a KPI is ok is taking me hours, and I keep having to interrupt my focus to log more and more tickets.\n\nI feel like writing it like this makes this whole situation sound like a shit job. I don’t think it is, maybe a bit, but we’ll, people here are engineers, but they know manufacturing. They don’t know anything about data. They just want to see the amount of boxes made, the % of time lost grouped by reason and etc… I am learning a lot, and I kinda want to master this whole mess, and I kinda like working with data. It makes me think.\n\nBut I need a better way of work. I want to hear your thoughts, I don’t know anyone that has real experience in Data, especially in manufacturing. Any tips? How can I improve or learn? Manage my tickets? Time expectations? \n\nAny ideas on how to better understand my tables, my queries, find data inconsistencies? Make sure I don’t miss anything in my measure? \n\nI can probably get them to pay for my learning. Is there a course that I can take to learn more?\n\nAlso, they are open to hiring an external team to help us with this whole ordeal. Is that a good idea? I feel like it would be super helpful, unless we lost track of some of our infrastructure (although we actually don’t have it well documented either).\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading and just tell me anything, everything is helpful\n",

You could technically do it with anyone or anything, but for me it’s been my now 3 month old daughter.\n\nSo, obviously children require a lot of attention, so she’s pretty much right by me anytime I’m not at work. She really enjoys just listening to me and her mother talk, and that gave me an idea to help keep her calm while I code. That idea was to just explain everything I’m working on as I do it to her. Building a database schema? I explain every step out loud to her. An API endpoint? Same thing. What I’ve realized in doing this is that I’m retaining information exponentially better than I was. There’s something about saying it all out loud, and pretending that I’m legitimately teaching her how to do what I’m working on, that has made learning and retaining information so much easier. \n\nSo the moral is talk out loud about what you’re doing. Explain it to your dog, your significant other (if they’re willing to listen), your cat, goldfish, child, or whatever/whoever you have that will listen. It’s been a game changer for me. ",

        "author": "soumyadyuti_245",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey everyone,  \nSo I’m in my 2nd year of college and recently landed a backend engineering internship. It sounded super exciting at first—cool tech stack like WebRTC, Mediasoup, AWS, Docker, NGINX, etc. The internship is 4 months long, and we were told the first month would be for training. I was really looking forward to learning all this industry-level stuff.\n\nWell… that didn’t really happen the way I thought it would.\n\nThey gave us an AWS “training” on literally day two, but it was just a surface-level overview—stuff like “this is EC2, this is S3,” and then moved on. Then like 4 days in, they dropped us into the actual codebase of their project (which is like a Zoom/Google Meet alternative), gave us access to a bunch of repos, and basically said, “Figure it out.”\n\nI was still pumped at this point. I dove into the code, started learning the tools they’re using, and I even told them I’m still learning AWS but I’m 100% willing to put in the effort if someone can guide me a bit. I wasn’t expecting hand-holding, just *some* support.\n\nThen came this task: me and another intern were asked to deploy one of their websites on an AWS EC2 instance. Sounds simple, right? Yeah, it wasn’t. It involved changing environment variables, working with existing instances, setting up Docker containers, and doing a sort of “redeployment” on a live setup. And we weren’t even trained for any of this.\n\nIt’s been three days now, and we’ve been stuck. Trying to figure things out through tutorials, trial and error, asking questions. But the people assigning the task just keep saying “This is a simple task, you should be able to do this.” No real help, no troubleshooting, just passive-aggressive comments about how we’re not capable if we can’t get it done.\n\nThey say they want us to “learn by doing,” but at this point it doesn’t feel like learning—it feels like being set up to fail. Oh, and they also want us to document the entire experience, like a reflection on what we learned… but how am I supposed to reflect when I’m stuck the entire time and no one’s guiding us?\n\nWhat’s really messing with me is that this wasn’t even part of the actual project work. This was just some side task they threw at us. Meanwhile, my college work is piling up, my sleep schedule’s shot, and honestly, it’s getting hard to stay motivated when it feels like I’m not being given a fair chance to succeed.\n\nI’m not afraid of hard work. I *want* to learn. But this whole “sink or swim” approach with no support is just burning me out. And it makes me feel like if I fail at this one task, they’ll label me as someone who doesn’t know AWS—which isn’t even fair because I’m *literally* just starting out.\n\nSo yeah, I don’t know. Maybe I’m overthinking it. Maybe this is just how things are. But it’s starting to feel more like they care about the results than actually mentoring or helping us grow.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation? Is this normal? Or are they actually just mishandling the whole internship thing?",

Listen, I’m not exactly over here worrying about what other people are thinking when I’m busy with my own stuff, but I have always taken an interest in psychology and I’m curious about this.\n\nIsn’t the goal of a lot of programming to be able to accomplish complex things more easily? If what I’m making has no requirement for being extremely fast, why should I choose to use C++ just because it’s “real programming”? Isn’t that sort of self defeating? A hatchet isn’t a REAL axe, but sometimes you only need a hatchet, and a real axe is overkill.\n\nShouldn’t we welcome something that allows us to more quickly get our ideas out into the screen? It isn’t like any sort of coding is truly uncomplicated; people who don’t know how to code look at what I make as though I’m a wizard. So it’s just this weird value on complication that’s only found among people that do the very most complicated types of coding.\n\nBut then also, the more I talk to the rockstar senior devs, the more I realize that they all have my view; the more they know, the more they value just using the best tool for the job, not the most complex one.",

        "author": "Numerous-Smile-8780",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey everyone. This is more of a story than a question (though I could really use some advice at the end).\n\nI graduated in Civil Engineering because, honestly, I could never find something I truly enjoyed doing—or maybe I just lacked the discipline and drive (lazy, you might say). I got my degree in 2020, worked a bit during the pandemic, but was constantly unhappy.\n\nIn September 2021, I joined a gym, changed my diet, shifted my mindset, and started studying programming during my lunch breaks at work (and sometimes even during work hours, not gonna lie).\n\nBy April 2022, I quit my job to study full-time. In September 2022, I joined a 3-month .NET training program offered by a consulting company and got hired afterward. I worked mostly with backend—mostly .NET, some TypeScript/NestJS, and various short-term projects. I constantly felt like I wasn't good enough or like I wasn't on the right path, but I tried not to overthink it. I just kept pushing forward, learning every day.\n\nThen in January 2024, a friend invited me to join his startup. I worked both jobs (my full-time and the startup) until October 2024. The tech stack at the startup was Flutter + Python. I learned a lot of new things and used AI extensively to help me. Because of that, I sometimes feel like I didn’t *really* learn, if that makes sense?\n\nIn August 2024, I was promoted in my full-time job (mid dev, earning \\~BRL 6000). But in January 2025, I felt the need for change and started applying to companies abroad. On March 12, 2025, I was hired by a Canadian company (they have an office here in Brazil), and now I'm earning more than I did with both previous jobs combined—plus way better benefits.\n\nHere’s the problem: The company is very process-heavy and bureaucratic. I’ve been here almost a month and haven’t been able to look at code for more than two straight days. I’ve done tiny tweaks here and there, but most of my time is spent trying to find something to do. And this feeling of uselessness, of not doing enough, is driving me crazy.\n\nIt got so bad that I even considered changing careers again (my therapist thankfully helped me back off that ledge). But I started catastrophizing—thinking I have no future in tech, that I don’t belong, and that I’m a total fraud.\n\nSo here I am, asking you:  \nIs this feeling normal? Has anyone else gone through something like this?\n\nI think my journey has been pretty fast for a self-taught career changer. But maybe *because* I’m self-taught, and I’ve leaned so heavily on AI, I constantly question whether I really know anything—and whether I belong here at all.\n\nThanks for reading this far, if you did. Any advice or words of encouragement would mean the world.",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently participated in a hackathon, and the task we've been assigned feels incredibly overwhelming for a 15-day timeframe. We were asked to:\n\n1. Build a system where users can upload a photo, and it generates an AI-created image.\n2. Use another AI to create a lip-sync video from that generated image.\n3. Design a context-aware AI pet that interacts, talks, and reacts to the user.\n\nEach one of these tasks alone is ambitious, but combining all three within 15 days feels almost impossible. Even for a longer-term project, this would be quite challenging to execute effectively.\n\nIt makes me think that maybe the organizers were a bit inexperienced in setting realistic goals for participants. Has anyone encountered something like this in a hackathon before? Is this a normal expectation, or is this way out of scope for such a short event? i also noticed that the people hosting it its their first hackathon ",

        "content": "**CONTEXT:** I'm currently building a C++ app for me and my friends (for now, at the very least) to help me learn more about PostgreSQL, networking, cryptosecurity and UIX. The app itself it's a glorified version of what to all discussion purposes is a knockoff Discord: chats, rooms, servers, etc.  \n**PROBLEM:** As it uses sodium to encrypt passwords and sensitive data, I'm generating salts + hashs to protect the passwords against stealing. In that regard, I'm having trouble discerning if it's ethical to have the password be encrypted server-side (and saving all its hashing parameters in the server, given that in theory nobody but the admins should ever see the data) or have it hashed client-side, preventing the server to ever touch the sensitive data but rendering the data absolutely obscured even to the people moderating the servers. The idea is that the administrators of each server node get access to all the data regarding a user when the user gets suspended for infringing the TOS so that they may investigate the user's activity to sus out if they actually broke any rules. Issue is, with me and my friends this isn't an issue, but if I ever decide to expand or distribute it, I'm fearing my actions or lack thereof may end in an iffy legal conflict worse come to worst, I'm new to \\[ethics\\] in programming in general so I'm not as good deciding when and what is sensitive data or to what extent I'm crossing a line, so any insight is greatly appreciated here.",

I have never done any project like that in terms of the complexity and difficulty. It was hard at first but theory help me out a lot when trying to understand what I needed to do.\n\nI have long wanted to build a toy OS of my own from scratch if I can and this would I guess top the compiler in the amount of work I need to do and of course the complexity. This got me thinking what would be more difficult than an OS? Is this the hardest it would get? I am just a cyber security student, what do I know of these things.\n\nSo instead of just asking what could be harder I thought I would make it fun. What do you consider the Four Horsemen of Programming Projects? It can be general or tailored to yourself and what you have experienced in the past. You can add on to mine or make your own one of course. I only have two since I don't at all have much experience here lol.\n\nI'll start:\n\n\\- OS from scratch(boot loader and kernel etc.)\n\n\\- Compiler\n\n\\- ???\n\n\\- ???\n\n",

I want to be good at programming. I really do. But I often quit after just a few tutorials because I don’t understand the material well enough. I also know that I should stop just watching tutorials and actually start *building* things on my own—but I never really get to that part.\n\nLately, I’ve been thinking: maybe I should try building something I actually find fun—like a Minecraft mod in Java. Maybe that would keep me engaged and motivated. I enjoy Minecraft, and I think making something small but real could help me break the cycle.\n\nI genuinely want to learn how to code and become proficient, but I’m noticing a pattern: I get demotivated easily, I procrastinate, and I don’t build the discipline to push through. It’s a bit of a contradiction—I *want* to be good, but I don’t manage to get myself to actually *do* the hard parts.\n\nI would really appreciate advice or guidance. Here are my specific questions:\n\n* How would you approach learning to program properly when tutorials alone don’t work anymore?\n* How do you build discipline when you often lose motivation or feel stuck early on?\n* Would you still recommend finishing the last 2 years of a CS bachelor if programming doesn't come naturally to you?\n* Are there any beginner-friendly project ideas that helped *you* break the tutorial cycle?\n* Do you think making a Minecraft mod (or something similar I personally enjoy) is a good way to get into coding?\n* How do you push through when you're in that “I want to learn, but I suck at it” phase?\n\nAny personal stories, tough love, or practical tips would really help me out.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I got the job because I was already at the company, taught myself the basics of web development, and then expressed interest. The company was a startup. My leadership at the time pushed for me to get on the engineering team, and it eventually happened. No tech interview. No degree.\n\nI've been able to handle most tickets assigned to me without issue. With research, LLMs, and some Udemy courses after work, I've managed to get by. \n\nBut I feel like I'm severely lacking. Since I didn't go to school, and my self-taught journey didn't really touch on the fundamentals of computer science, I feel like I'm grossly underprepared and destined to fail. I feel like I know syntax well for the languages I use, and I understand at a basic level the technologies we use, such as docker, but I don't feel like I'm a good programmer. \n\nFor example, I don't know data-structures and algorithms at all. I've heard of Big O in passing and that's about it. I haven't really ever had to employ any design patterns, so I haven't learnt about them for the most part. \n\nI never had to grind leet code or anything like that. I put together a few simple React applications before this job and that's it. \n\nGranted, I've learnt things on the job, such as separating the UI layer from the business logic and data layer, but I just don't know what direction I should go to get better. \n\nShould I start learning the basic, fundamental stuff I kind of skipped? Should I start grinding leet code even though I already have a job? I'm planning on getting into a school next year and getting a degree, but what should I be doing in the meantime? \n\nAny and all advice would be super appreciated. Thank you! ",

When my wife retired I took up teaching English to have a portable career so we could travel, were in Albania currently. I love it and have been doing it for a couple years, sadly its not enough by itself to do what i need financially. I recently took up the challenge of teaching myself coding as a means to create my own website/learning space for students (I'm freelance) and I have found that it interests me more than I expected it to. currently I am learning HTML, Javascript, CSS and Python. I have next to zero experience coding but I've been enjoying the challenge. I have found numerous resources for learning, that's not my issue. My issue is, have I missed the boat? I am willing to invest in certification programs, but what opportunities are out there for a 55 year old beginner who has nothing in his background related to this field to work freelance, or less desirably, as a junior dev somewhere remotely? My plan is, get certifications (coursera or the like) create a portfolio of various projects focused on data analytics and start looking for work. Is this a pipe dream? ",

        "author": "AngryTrolly",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I’m a woman in my early twenties, and I’ve been doing a programming internship at a big, globally known company for a year now and honestly, I feel completely lost.\n\nI came from an economics background and decided to switch to tech almost two years ago. When I landed this internship, I had zero technical knowledge and was just starting my degree. Getting into such a well-known company so early on felt like a huge win, and in a way, it was. It’s the kind of name that looks amazing on a resume. The salary is really good for an intern, especially considering my financial background, and if I’m lucky enough to stay as a full-time employee, it would make a huge difference in my life financially.\n\nBut the reality inside hasn’t been as exciting as it looked from the outside. From the beginning, I felt completely out of place. I made mistakes, of course,but no one really explained what I was doing wrong or how I could do better. My team has been very distant, and over time, I’ve started to feel like I’m being excluded. Nothing direct or obvious, but there are signs. I try to contribute, show interest, ask questions… but everything I do seems to go unnoticed. It’s like I’m invisible. It makes me feel like all my efforts to grow or connect just don’t matter.\n\nOn top of that, the pressure is intense. Despite being an intern, it often feels like we’re expected to deliver at the level of someone with years of experience. There’s little to no feedback or support, just the expectation to perform. And honestly? It’s draining. I get home with no motivation to study, no energy to try, and I’ve even caught myself wondering if I should just cheat on exams to get through. I hate that it’s come to this.\n\nLately, I’ve been thinking that maybe I should try working at a smaller company—somewhere with a slower pace, less pressure, and where I might actually be able to learn and breathe. But then I feel guilty for even thinking that. The money I make now matters. Staying at this company would open doors. And walking away kind of hurts my ego too—it feels like I’d be “downgrading,” like I couldn’t handle it. But at the same time… what’s the cost of staying? I already feel the early signs of burnout. I’m constantly stressed, anxious, and losing the passion I once had for this field. What if staying just ruins my mental health long-term?\n\nI don’t know. I want to give IT a fair chance because I’ve already changed areas once and I don’t want to give up again. But this whole experience has made me doubt myself and question if I really belong here.\n\nHas anyone else been through something similar? How did you navigate it?",

        "content": "I would like to accomplish something but I'm not really sure how. Picture a function that takes an arbitrary 8 bit value. The function checks to see if the value is within a certain range, and returns a value based on the range the input value falls within:\n\n    int bucket_for_value(unsigned uint8_t x) {\n        if (x >= 0 && x < 32) return 0;\n        else if (x >= 32 && x < 64) return 1;\n        else if (x >= 64 && x < 96) return 2;\n        else if (x >= 96 && x < 128) return 3;\n        else if (x >= 128 && x < 160) return 4;\n        else if (x >= 160 && x < 192) return 5;\n        else if (x >= 192 && x < 224) return 6;\n        else if (x >= 224 && x < 256) return 7;\n        else return -1; // Out of range\n    }\n\nYou see, theoretically there's an equal chance for an arbitrary number to fall within any of these ranges.\n\nNow the challenging part. I want to be able to control the values within the parentheses using a single parameter (for the sake of illustration, imagine a physical knob), where the knob in the center evenly distributes the chance, as above. Then, turning it all the way to the left results in the first statement having a 100% chance in returning 0, like:\n\n    int bucket_for_value(unsigned uint8_t x) {\n        if (x >= 0 && x < 256) return 0;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 1;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 2;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 3;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 4;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 5;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 6;\n        else if (x >= 256 && x < 256) return 7;\n        else return -1; // Out of range\n    }\n\nAnd turning it all the way to the right results in a 100% chance of returning 7, like:\n\n    int bucket_for_value(unsigned uint8_t x) {\n        if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 0;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 1;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 2;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 3;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 4;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 5;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 0) return 6;\n        else if (x >= 0 && x < 256) return 7;\n        else return -1; // Out of range\n    }\n\nBut I want to also be able to have our hypothetical 'knob' to values between the center and extremes shown above, and have the value be 'weighted' accordingly. I have no idea how to implement this and though to ask here.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice. Appreciated. Thanks!",

From here I have three options:\n\n1. Skip the first project and move onto data visualisation  \n2. Move to a different book called *Practical Deep Learning* by Ronald T Kneusel  \n3. Start the free Harvard Course on AI.\n\nAny thoughts?",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\nI’m looking for the best free resource to learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python. I’m not trying to master every advanced concept right now—instead, I want to focus on intermediate-level DSA that's essential for interviews.\n\nIn my country, most interviewers don’t go too deep into DSA. They usually focus more on development skills, but DSA is still important as it’s often the first step of the interview process. That’s why I want to build a solid foundation—strong enough to clear this stage. I’m also looking to improve my understanding of OOP, core computer science concepts, and how they relate to problem-solving.\n\nWhat I really need is a one-stop structured resource that covers all key DSA topics in a proper order. Once I go through that, I don’t want to keep jumping between different tutorials (except for platforms like LeetCode or wherever we solve problems).\n\nAlthough I do have Coursera Plus right now, it will expire on June 20th, and I’m currently not in a position to pay for any other course/platform after that. So I would prefer a resource that’s completely free or at least accessible during this time.\n\nI have about 3 months of summer vacation coming up, with 10–12 hours per day available for DSA. So I’d really like to make the most of this time before university starts again.\n\nWould love any suggestions you have. Thanks in advance!\n\nTL;DR:\nI'm looking for a free, structured DSA resource in Python that covers everything in order—so I don’t have to rely on multiple sources (except problem-solving platforms like LeetCode). I have Coursera Plus until June 20, but I can’t pay after that. I’ll have 10–12 free hours daily for the next 3 months, so I want to make the most of it before university resumes.\nNeed something that includes OOP + core CS concepts too. Suggestions appreciated!\n\n",

I've been coding times to times, but this year, I feel the urge to improve my skills, maybe because I am growing up... I don't really know. I'm feared of losing my knowledge, several months ago I learned beatmaking, and I'm getting better, I'm really proud of it, but... programming. I want to work as a programmer or in the IT domain when I'll be an adult. Sometimes I'm coming back at home and I'm like \"Okay, let's practice !... but how ? Where should I start ?\". It's as if I wanted to code, but don't have any projects ideas so I can't practice.\n\nI'm not sure if it's the right sub to post this, thank you for reading and if you have any solutions.",

        "content": "I used to think landing a job at a big tech company would be the peak of my career. Everyone made it sound like once you got in, your life was set. Prestige, money, smart people, meaningful work. I bought into the whole thing. I worked my ass off to get there. Leetcode, system design prep, referrals, rejection after rejection. And when I finally got the offer, I remember feeling like I had won the lottery.\n\nThat feeling didn’t last long.\n\nWhat I stepped into was one of the most toxic, mentally draining environments I’ve ever experienced. It didn’t happen all at once. It crept in. The first few weeks were exciting, but then the cracks started to show. The pressure was insane. The deadlines were borderline delusional. There was this unspoken expectation to be available at all times. Messages late at night. Work bleeding into weekends. No one ever said it out loud, but if you wanted to be seen as serious, as someone who \"got it,\" you had to sacrifice everything else.\n\nThe culture was a constant performance. I couldn’t just do my job. I had to sell it. Everything I worked on needed a narrative. Every project had to be spun into something that could fit neatly into a promotion packet or a perf review. I wasn’t building software. I was building a case to not be forgotten. Because every quarter, someone got labeled as underperforming. It didn’t always make sense who it was. Sometimes it was the quietest person on the team. Sometimes it was someone who just had the wrong skip manager. Everyone smiled in meetings but no one felt safe.\n\nThe politics were unbearable. Influence mattered more than clarity. Visibility mattered more than functionality. Everything had to be socialized in just the right way to just the right people. One wrong Slack message or a poorly timed piece of feedback could nuke months of work. And if you didn’t know how to play the game, it didn’t matter how smart or hardworking you were. You were dead in the water.\n\nWork-life balance was a joke. I was constantly anxious, constantly behind, constantly checking messages like something was going to blow up if I missed a ping. I stopped sleeping properly. I stopped seeing friends. I stopped caring about things I used to love. My weekends were spent recovering from the week and bracing for the next one. And the whole time I kept telling myself it was temporary. That it would get better. That if I just made it to the next level, it would all be worth it.\n\nBut it never got better. The pressure just got worse. The bar kept moving. The layoffs started. The reorganizations. The endless leadership changes. Half my team vanished in one cycle. I remember joining a Zoom call one morning and realizing I didn’t even know who my manager reported to anymore. People were disappearing mid-project. Morale was a punchline. Everyone was scared but pretending they weren’t. Everyone was tired but still smiling in team standups. I started to feel like I was losing my grip.\n\nWhen I finally left, I didn’t feel free. I felt broken. It took months before I stopped checking my calendar every morning out of reflex. I still have dreams about unfinished sprints and last-minute roadmap changes. I still flinch when I see a Slack notification.\n\nPeople glamorize these jobs because of the compensation and the brand names. But no one talks about the cost. I gave that place everything and it chewed through me like I was nothing. Just another seat to fill. Just another cog in the machine. I left with more money, sure. But I also left with burnout, insomnia, and a genuine hatred for the industry I used to be passionate about.\n\nI don’t know if I’ll go back to big tech. Right now I’m just trying to feel like a human again.",

The vast majority of ppl who have an internship lined up have probably had it secured for a while now and the closer we approach the summer, the harder it is for ppl without an internship to land one. \n\nAnyway here's where I enter. Im a Junior cs major at a t50 school, with an average/slightly below average gpa, and no past internship experience apart from personal projects on my resume(nothing to write home about). I started seriously applying on jan 1st applying to maybe 5-10 places as daily as I could. a variety of roles too (frontend,backend, fullstack, ML, and data science) for the most part id get ghosted, receive an automated follow up email 3 weeks later saying they went with another candidate, or if I was lucky get a aysnchronous hackerank coding assessment in which id get ghosted after. I try tweaking my resume a bit, test out different formats and even fluffing up a bit of my projects in an attempt to get any response. Obviously this is a common experience for many ppl here but I keep at it all the way from then till now with maybe only getting 3 actual 1:1 interviews. At this point summer Is approaching and I have no idea what I can really do on my end. \n\nI hear on reddit,tiktok and pretty much everywhere that one of the best ways to get your foot in the door is through a referral however, I had none. I tried reaching out to recruiters, but I barely got a response this late in the cycle. Anyway I happen to stumble on one of my childhood friends linkdin page and see that he got a recommendation from the chief officer of the company he intered at the summer before so I hit him up and ask him about it. He encourages me to send him an email. So I find his company email and send him a connect request pretty much stating that I was a good friend of the person he gave the recommendation to and asking if their company was still accepting interns attaching my resume and if we could schedule a time to call. Within 2 days he replies saying that \"any friend of (friends-name) is a friend of mine\", that I had a solid mix of skills on my resume, and that he was going to check if there are any project/internship openings for me to do. Fast forward to the call, I did some quick prep on reviewing my resume and the company. He was a super nice guy, asked me some questions about my resume, what the job entails, and just overall a chill conversation abt who I was and my skills. i didn't have to do any leetcode style technical interview and I essentially bypassed the whole \"traditional process in a sense\". So yeah I knew connections were important within the work force and adult life but holy shit this was one of those eye opener moments cause I didn't realize how powerful it could be.\n\nTLDR: average cs student struggles to land an internship let alone even hear back from companies but uses an unrealized connection to bypass the \"traditional\" interview process and land the job",

Sign me up.” It sounded like the ideal setup,, good money, flexible lifestyle, interesting work. But the reality? A whole different beast.\n\nFirst, just learning my job was a battle. Senior folks gatekeeping knowledge, no clear training, just figuring things out on my own through trial, error, and stress. It took way longer than it should’ve and left me constantly feeling like I was behind.\n\nThen I climbed the ladder. On paper, that sounds like a win,,, but every role I left was on the verge of collapsing. I’d move up, get more money, but also inherit more chaos. Now I make decent money, but it comes with a nonstop stream of incidents, rollbacks, escalations, and worst of all: on-call. There’s no break. No peace. I’m always on edge, waiting for the next fire.\n\nMeanwhile, my friends outside of tech? They seem so much lighter. Sure, they’ve got problems like everyone else,,, but they’re not mentally trapped in their jobs 24/7. Me? This job has consumed my life. Even when I’m off, I’m not really off. I’m checking alerts, dreading pings, and thinking about what might break next.\n\nAnd to make things worse, every company wants people with 10+ years of experience, and offshore teams are replacing roles left and right. It’s harder than ever to pivot or even find a quieter tech job.\n\nHonestly? I’m at the point where I just want a normal job. One where I show up, do what I’m supposed to do, and then go live my damn life.\n\nBtw I worked have real jobs before i don’t understand why folks just quick to assume it’s just been tech. I worked construction for years so I know what it’s like I’m just saying I wish I had a role to mentally clock out of like normal roles. \n\n\nSorry for the rant but damn I’m just burnt out.

        "author": "Neurprise",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I recently joined this startup near the middle/end of February for a new backend team they were building for a new product. At the same time as me joined a manager, older guy who's worked in startups for 20 years, as well as a coworker who worked at a big tech company.\n\nAfter two \"failed\" sprints, I had a 1:1 yesterday, as we usually do weekly on Fridays, and he basically told me that he had performance concerns about me and that I need to improve for the next sprint or two or \"things will get messy (implying termination).\" Soon after the conversation, he and HR send me a letter I had to sign essentially saying what he said in the call. Some details on the situation:\n\n- He said that in all his 20 years of working for startups, not once has he failed a sprint (and he defined failing one as not having any tickets roll over to the next sprint), yet since we started, he has failed every single one (when we first started, there was one ticket that blocked us and it rolled over, and he considered that a failure and wrote a big email about how he's sorry he failed). \n\n- Manager comes from a culture that emphasizes working long hours. Now I come from the same culture (I'm sure you can guess what it is) but I was born here instead so I don't have the same sort of expectations as he does.\n\n- Coworker is an overachiever who has spent considerable time at a big tech and brought a super convoluted [microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ) architecture that is very difficult to grasp. The way it's set up, you essentially can't even fully run it locally as it uses dev containers and there's some issue with the ports overlapping when you try to work on multiple services at once, and you also essentially need one IDE window open for each service as they're all in different repos of course. He has so many PRs, it's even hard to follow for me to be productive, so, to be fair, I'm not as productive as I could be, but it's more me not being able to deal with this overcomplicated codebase. Since joining only 1.5 months ago, there was essentially no ramp up period for me to learn the new codebase and architecture that the overachieving coworker built in a week.\n\n- Together they essentially work at all hours of the day, most recently they were working at 10 pm working on some issue and I saw the Slack conversation only once I opened my laptop the next day. The manager during one of the standup calls said he was up around 5 or 6 am from the night before trying to debug some build issue.\n\n- I was dealing with a longer running illness and took 2 sick days a few weeks ago and then 2 earlier this week. The coworker took over my tickets that I had in progress and just finished them himself.\n\n- Manager said they are dealing with deadlines imposed on them from above, wanting to get a full backend and frontend MVP out by the end of next month, so it seems some of this stuff is him trying to deflect issues onto performance concerns on me, but funnily enough we have a separate frontend team and they seem a lot more chill, they essentially haven't done much as the designs themselves have not been finalized.\n\nThe multi-page letter itself essentially mentioned some of these points and implied that I didn't work on enough tickets last sprint and none this sprint (due to coworker finishing them) and said that while they understood I had an illness, I essentially should have completed them by the end of the sprint anyway. The letter literally had a *day-by-day* account of every day of the sprints that I had failed to finish a ticket and that I should have communicated what I was doing that day. Never in my professional life had I seen such minute detail and I honestly don't know how the manager spent so much of their own time to draft this up. At the end of this section, he essentially implied that I lied about what I was doing every day and it said \"dishonesty is not tolerated at this company.\"\n\nI brought up all of these sorts of concerns (overachieving coworker, hard to grasp codebase, illness) multiple times to my manager previously in 1:1s and he kinda acted like he sympathized but essentially said tough shit you gotta finish your work (like he acted nice in the video call and said it diplomatically but then on the letter it was harshly worded).\n\nAt the end, the manager said that I should think about all this over the weekend and give it a \"fresh start\" on Monday, implying improving massively over the next few weeks. Is this essentially a PIP? Should I actually try working on this or start looking for new roles? Problem is this role pays quite well, at least 15% higher than other roles I've been seeing in the market so wondering if that's worth it or not (or maybe they'll just fire me anyway after a month).",

[This](https://thebehavioral.substack.com/p/using-the-carl-method-to-structure) post was the most helpful for me, but I would recommend checking out the other posts as well!\n* I do think I do excellent work in a real job setting, but I am pretty bad at leetcode and system design, and get horribly nervous when live-coding in an interview setting!\n* After the first month of job hunting, I said, \"Fuck it\" and put the obnoxious green #OPENTOWORK banner on my LinkedIn profile photo. I had always heard it makes people look \"desperate\", so I had never tried it. Y'all, **my inbox exploded** the *day* after I did this, and recruiters even mentioned that they were reaching out to me *because* they had noticed it. I'm talking 1 recruiter message per month at best, to 10 the next day, and \\~10-15 per week after that. I did get sent a handful of irrelevant positions, but nothing I couldn't sift through.\n   * I cannot emphasize how much this is worth trying. Maybe it deters some recruiters, but it attracts a lot of worthwhile ones too, at least for the non-elite positions I was targeting.\n* I updated my LinkedIn headline and bio to have a bunch of keywords. I edited my bio once a week, even just to reword it a little bit. I suspected that this helped keep me higher in recruiter searched results. Not sure if that was true or not, but it didn't hurt.\n* I had some bites from continuing to cold-apply, and some of them were remote positions too - but these interviews were much harder and the recruiters for these were much flakier and less enthused overall.\n* I got a ton of traction from the recruiters in my inbox. The offers I later received all stemmed from recruiters in my inbox. There are definitely a lot of companies that rely entirely on recruiters and don't even bother with making job listings.\n* In the interviews for the companies that then gave me an offer - there was no leetcode and no typical system design. Besides behavioral questions, some of the technical portions involved questions about domain knowledge, OOP, design patterns, \"how would you approach this problem\" kind of questions, and some code reviews. I answered them well, but definitely not perfectly, and had some misses as well. Despite that - I was told by all of my interviewers that they loved me as a candidate!\n* Most interviewers did not give a single shit about my time off. Some did ask, but totally understood when I said it was a layoff. If they then asked me about the gap, I explained it as being due to grief, and also taking some time to do a non-tech (but cool and unique) project to support a family member. I emphasized that I only began to job hunt seriously in the past 2-3 months.\n   * For those who have been hunting for longer - maybe it's worth considering making the beginning of that gap sound intentional rather than like you've been getting rejected for a long time? YMMV\n* Having multiple final interviews resulting in multiple offers on the same day felt very serendipitous (and gave me great leverage for negotiating), but the end-of-the-quarter timing probably factored in.\n\nThanks for reading, and good luck!\n\n---\n\nEdit: copying-and-pasting a comment I left about behavioral/general interviewing tips for more visibility:\n\n*Definitely would recommend the substack I mentioned above (*[*here's the top posts*](https://thebehavioral.substack.com/archive?sort=top)*) - honestly such a great and free resource. I have found all of his posts helpful!*\n\n*Before interviews I do a little meditation with* [*4-7-8 breathing*](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324417) *and it helps calm my nerves. This was a tip from my therapist. Sometimes I will take 100 mg of*[ *l-theanine* ](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1053/theanine)*with my morning coffee too, I find it helps with anxiety without dulling my alertness.*\n\n*Having the attitude of a good coworker goes a long way - arguably it's even more important than being technically competent. Imagine the kind of person that you would want to work with. Show that you are humble, willing to admit when you don't know something, curious, not afraid to ask questions, proactive, easygoing, focused on the big picture/business impact, and have a growth mindset.*\n\n*Find a list of common questions, take some notes on how you would plan on answering them, and actually practice answering them out loud to yourself, or even better, to a friend. Practice until it's like muscle memory. There are some software interviewing discords (try the search bar), where I bet you could find some people to practice mock interviews with if you don't have anyone in your personal life. Have a few stories prepared that could apply to multiple questions with a little tweaking.*\n\n*When answering questions, I try to find little opportunities to show off my knowledge and experience even if doing so isn't the most straightforward way of answering the question - e.g. I will connect the question to a project I did or a problem I have solved before, will mention a relevant case study to show that I keep up with industry trends, will mention a quirk of the domain that shows high-level understanding, etc. Don't go on a huge tangent if it's not directly answering the question, but an offhand sentence or two is okay. I've gotten some great reactions and feedback from interviews from doing this.*\n\n*I always send a thank-you email after the interview too, with some details specific to what they had shared with me about the position and the company.*\n\n---\n\nNote: This was originally posted in r/ExperiencedDevs, where the mods removed it for being \"general\" career advice that could apply to any career...lol\n\nEdit: I'm paranoid and won't share the company names or my resume, sorry. Feel free to ask some questions about them and the process, but no guarantees that I'll answer ",

Probably 15-20 minutes to even understand the requirements in their entirety.

Got most of the Node problem done but it kept failing test cases and I was triyng to debug but there were SOOO many requirements. It was hard to even understand it in it's entirety. Then it just reset my entire Node code for some reason and I just closed the assessment out of pure frustration at that point. I mean this would be hard to do even with AI and full-blown cheating. WTF are they expecting from us? This industry is getting out of control imo.\n\nHow can they realistically expext you to solve 5 problems in 3 hours. That's not even close to how it would be at work. They basically asked me close to half a weeks worth of work to sovle in 3 hours. Understanding the problems and the files alone takes a long time.\n\nWtf has this industry come to. That was legitimately the most insane OA I have ever taken.\n\nEDIT: After reading the comments I told the recruiter to withdraw my application as I am no longer interested.

The tech job market’s brutal right now—rejections are constant, ghosting is common, and it’s easy to feel like you're just another resume in a pile.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was contacted by a recruiter for a senior level role. They submitted me, and two days later I had the interview. I came in straightforward—no fluff, no buzzwords—just real experience and direct answers.\n\nA couple days later, the recruiter reached out to give me the feedback call. They said:\n\n>\n\n**Bad news?** I didn’t get the job.  \n**Good news?** I made such a strong impression that the manager wanted to bring me on anyway—**in a completely new position that didn’t exist.**\n\nThey literally created a new **role**, adjacent to the original one I applied for, just to bring me in. No public posting, no backup list. Just a straight-up “let’s figure out how to make this work.”\n\n# Here’s why I’m sharing this:\n\nSometimes not getting the job doesn’t mean you failed.  \nIt means that role wasn’t built for you—but that doesn’t mean *you* didn’t make an impact.\n\nIf you show up clear, focused, and ready? The right manager will notice. And sometimes, they’ll do more than just say “we’ll keep in touch.”  \nThey’ll build the door you were supposed to walk through.\n\nI know this occurrence is rare but things can happen, people can open doors for you. Im proof it can and i'll even add something else, im not super special or anything like that. I just conveyed my experience the best way i could during the interview and tied past experiences to what they were looking for and got lucky for sure. Keep applying guys dont give up!",

        "author": "wbcm",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I used to be active on SO around 10 years ago and it was generally great, mostly helpful and insightful but only a little rough around the edges. Fast forward to the last month and I started being active there again and... using it over the last month has been a dumpster fire. It really feels like the point of the site has gone from providing answers/solutions to being more of a game of clout and academic trivialities. After really reviewing the current rules of the site and the culture that has formed on it, it seems like SO is trying to extinct itself. There are two big problems I see.\n\n\n1: The culture is designed and empowered to be horrible\nComing back to answering questions after so many years I was really surprised to see the same one or two dozen people across nearly everything I was answering. The small group of power users or moderators have an uncanny ability to be posting or editing things on there all day. They also seem to be the ones who are more eager to downvote answers or close questions with little regard for the community, or even following the conversations. The way the points system works basically means that you cannot interact with anything in the community until amassing a lot of points, which is normally gate-kept by these power users. Other people can also upvote your posts, but in order to get the ability to upvote it seems like newer users have to endure a lot of bullying to get there, if they get there at all. If you are new and get a couple downvotes on your posts you are not allowed to post anything again until your existing posts get more upvotes, but there is no robust way for that to organically happen in most of the site that only sees under a 100 views per question. This has created a weird vacuum where the power users kind of have the ability to knight newer users or essentially permanently disable newer user's accounts. On top of this, the culture seems to really prize putting people (and their questions and answers) down. The first couple of times someone would leave a single sentence comment on my answer basically saying \"you're wrong\", I was more eager to engage with it to see what I was missing. Over time the majority of such engagements turned out to be someone who would continue to say \"you're wrong\" but not want to elaborate, or missing understanding on the question/answer that was relevant. Over time, I realized that this was just the culture that is there. Unsurprisingly, I have began to recognize certain power users usernames and saw them bullying newer people in the questions and answers. This is alienating a huge group of people who are either new to programming and SO, or are experienced programmers that are new to SO. AKA, not many new people want to stay on the site. This massively reflects in the lowering number of questions coming in and the speed in which they are answered. This is only worsened by the expanding prevalence of LLMs. It is hard to see the next generation of programmers preferring the high likelihood of waiting a long time to be bullied on SO, vs an LLM who can instantly offer any type of information for your question and will not be toxic. \n\n\n2: [duplicate] \nIt is good to not let a question get asked for the millionth time in a row, but I saw so many questions that were immediately closed as duplicates and the provided duplicates were either many years out of date or only partially related. At a certain point all the programming questions that people can ask, will have been asked... unless new programming languages or software versions allow for substantively new questions to be asked. There was no good globally centralized place to ask programming questions before SO, and so there was at least 30 years of programming questions that needed to be satiated. As time goes on, more and more questions will either legitimately be duplicates or, more likely, a mod is gonna mark it as duplicate since one part of the question overlaps with one part of another that was asked since the inception of SO. At this point, SO reads more like an encyclopedia than a lively place of discourse. Take somewhere like reddit, quora, or even the comment section of a youtube video where you are learning something, these all feel like they are much more engaging and are great places to connect and ask questions. SO on the other had feels like a good place to get your question turned away. Talking to some newer programmers I know, they have a shared sentiment that SO is a bad place to ask questions and prefer reddit and LLMs instead. There seemed to be a shared experience between all of them that any time they google a question that SO is often towards the top, which exposed them to it often, but when they made accounts and started trying to be active there they were met with bad experiences. This kind of reinforces the feeling like SO is heading towards being an encyclopedia/ghost town rather than a community. \n\n\nIn any case, these are just my loose thoughts around being active on SO after having not been after almost a decade. I used to remember it as being a great place and have just generally been surprised about how dumb and toxic it feels to be on there now. Do other people feel this way? Or did I somehow just jump back into the wrong parts of it?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've been interviewing for a while now, mostly out of curiosity. I rarely send direct applications so it's all outreach. The out-reaches for which I was unqualified ended quickly, the others ended up to 2 position or offer. I am not decided to accept or not at this time.\n\nI am doing this post because I see all of you focusing on coding, and mainly on coding aspects that are irrelevant to the job. A job is the software industry is much more than that.\n\nHere is some feedback for those who are curious:\n\n* I had no Leetcode at any point. I had a few home assignments which could be considered Leetcode Easy. Do not underestimate them. An assignment should be treated as a full scale project that will go into production. They could ask you to design a function that adds two numbers, the point is not here. Focus on:\n   * Write your requirements and assumptions in a document\n   * Make sure the project is usable out of the box. If setup is required describe it: if they ask you to develop in Python, make sure to package it using Poetry/Uv or whatever you want but simply shipping the function is not acceptable\n   * Write clear code, respect conventions, take care of the architecture, think about the user\n   * Be consistent in all aspects: in documentation, and in coding. Example: Don't separate somes lines by a ',', some others by a '.' and others by nothing. Chose one and stick to it\n   * Document your code: do not comment it, code should be self explanatory, if its not rework it, write actual Doxygen/XML documentation or whatever is the standard for the targeted langage\n   * Provide a unit test suite\n   * If you have time, showcase your project by integrating it into Github CI or Equivalent\n   * OA are an occasion to showcase your work practices and general knowledge, the problem itself is irrelevant, don't focus on it too much\n* SD interview:  had my first and only SD interview and passed. Your design is not important at all, providing you are not proposing absurd solutions. Focus on:\n   * Communicating. Explore all possibilities, even the obviously dumb ones, but CRITICIZE them. What's expected from an engineer is not someone who has an answer to everything but someone who can think, is creative, and is then capable of weeding out their ideas\n   * Always clarify functional and non-functional requirements. You are in control, make sure to select a sub-set of functional requirements that works good for you and is easy to design. Mention the more complex requirements and just state you won't take them into account. For instance, if they ask you do design a messaging app, focus on 1:1 conversations, emojis, read recipes and files exchange. You may want to discuss group messaging to show-off. Don't. Mention it, don't design it\n   * QPS values are not important. Once again it's all about thought process. The number themselves are irrelevant. Make sure to target realistic order of magnitude. You do not design YT for 10 users, but maybe assuming 10M a day is enough even though we all know the real number are hundred of times higher\n   * Ask for closed-feedback regularly. Once again an engineer is not someone who has all answer by themselves but someone who can communicate, listen to others, and find team approved solutions\n   * Keep things simple\n* Technical questions:\n   * It is ok you do not know. Do NOT invent an answer and assert it like its true. Simply states: \"Well I do not know that, but I guess we COULD do something like this, what do you think about it ? How would you approach this\"\n   * You should never have absolute answer to anything, unless its an academic question. The objective of those questions is to understand how you think and how you are going to interact with the team. You are already in a team, you + the interviewers form a work team. Keep it in mind.\n   * An interview is a discussion, not an exam, even if its on the question/answer format\n* Behavioral:\n   * Do not invent/memorize dumb stories, be them generated by ChatGPT or else.\n   * Those questions are to understand how you behave on a human an in a team, your answer should be clearly constructed, show the value of your work, and how you make impact/drive a team direction\n   * Don't trust the examples shown on Rainforest LP/STAR video, this is pure BS. **No one ever** walked into a project that was in shambles, sit and drafted a plan, and magically the plan solved all the roadblocks and the company earned 200M$ just thanks to this man \\\\o/. This is pure BS and as an interviewer someone who answers to me in this way will not pass to the next round.\n   * Always place value in the team. There's no self made man, when you were \"faced with a challenge\" it's not just you but the entire team. While you had individual actions that are important to highlight during those questions, as an interviewer this is when we see if someone appropriates the success or if they understand the value the entire team brought. You probably had project you lead alone, use them in those rounds, but always give credit to the team in other example, use that to illustrate how you can drive team decisions\n   * It is OK to take examples where you failed. Failing is part of the game. Use that to show how you reflect, what you learned, and what you are now doing differently\n   * Be yourself, aka **do not invent stories**, there's no point in not being a good cultural fit, it will only lead to regret on your end: I was once told in an interview they already had someone internally but that person was too introvert for the role they were interviewing me, and that my first decision would probably be to fire or not this person. I answered to them that my values are more about finding the strengths of a person and empowering them, rather than trying to have them fit in boxes they don't want to belong to. That person was a good employee who simply wanted to be directed in their work instead of leading change by themselves. They did not pass me to the next round and that was the right decision for all of us.\n\nI know that some companies are trying to transform the interview process in a theatrics show, but it's not what it is about. It's about connecting and showing that you can interact with multiple people on multiple teams, reflect on your ideas, and understand the ones coming from others.",

I was doing this type of _trial period_ in which I was supposed to implement a feature in the new application they were working on. While I was able to make it work the first time, my code made some violations to the architecture. That's fine and it was my mistake, but my boss (who's also the owner of the startup) was beyond mean in his review on my PR, asking me if I even read the code and very harsh stuff, which I really found unnecessary since it was my first time working with that app. From that point I just felt pressured to stop feeling like I was embarrassing myself as opposed to trying to deeply learn the app, so I made a couple more of fixes and again, same feedback, which wasn't constructive at all. The closest thing to constructive criticism I received was when he told me to look at how one of the files did the job, which I wonder, why not do that from the beginning? \n\nAt the end he said he didn't want to continue as my work was _completely unacceptable_, and what's funny about that is that he made a comment in my very first PR about a technique I used and he labeled it as _something you should never be doing in the industry_, and yet, I actually had taken that logic from the already existing code that he himself had either written or reviewed before, since it was on the master branch.\n\nI guess the question is, do all startups expect you to get everything right from the start and basically offer no mentorship, even when the job description listed 2 years of experience?

        "content": "Context--\n\nIn 2019, I made the decision to join a bootcamp and learn to code as I graduated from my university as a pre-med student who didn't get into any programs, with no career path in mind. It was very tough, but I got my first job at a 4 person dev shop (was horrible) making $55k a year. I was fired from here because of a an approved vacation I took, and a few months later I got another job at another very small software company where I worked as the only web developer and mobile developer. My skills at this time were react and react native.\n\n\nMy next job was during the COVID boom, 2021, where I finally doubled my salary and started making $115k as a react native mobile dev working for a startup. I felt like I had finally made it in life. I thought I would be promoted to senior, then maybe manager or director, or something like that. I was learning a ton and working with very intelligent people.\n\n\nAfter a year, the market hit the first mass wave of layoffs, in which I was cut. I got lucky and immediately was picked up as a full time contractor for a retail company that you have all heard of, which is where I remain today. I knew this would be a shitty job- its filled with contractors and H1B workers. No one knows a single thing, everything is handed off to someone else, no one wants to collaborate. There is immense pressure from above to find a solution to a problem at all costs, design comes second always. I feel super trapped here. I now work on a team where I maintain 10+ small react native and native android applications, but the code is all 5+ years old and written as spaghetti. I have recently realized that I am not progressing at all in my career and scared im going to be stuck here forever. I have gained some skills in kotlin, jetpack compose, but I can't seem to get a job interview anywhere with 5 YOE as a react native dev. My question to you guys is what am I supposed to be doing right now.\n\nPresent--\n\nMy job is giving me extreme career anxiety. I am basically working at an H1B visa mill whereas I want to be back at a company like my last job where everything flowed better. I am thankful to have a job in this economy but its really starting to affect my mental health working here. I am developing extreme anxiety that my career won't exist in a few years due to AI and offshoring, and in the meanwhile I'm not getting any valuable skills here. I am in serious need of advice as to what the hell I should be doing right now. How do I escape this company? They are giving me more and more responsibility, with no promotion or raise in pay. I am doing more and more non SWE related work as upper management continues to squeeze us from all sides. Am I doomed or is there a way out for me? I don't want to leave tech, but I don't know how to escape this god awful company.  What skills do I need to be developing? What do I need to be doing? Is mobile dev a bad choice? Should I try to switch to back end? Please help me.  I can share my stripped resume if necessary.  I should also add, I am currently fully remote which I think is really bad for my mental health.  I am located in NYC.",

I'm basically left alone to write and review code.\n\nDespite this, I am struggling to care at all about my job. I sit down every morning and the last thing I want to do is write more code. I've removed all distractions from my desk (no phone, no internet scrolling) yet my mind wanders for many hours per day, increasingly all 8 of them.\n\nI worry that the abstract problem solving needed to program is just too taxing for me. It's not that I'm not intelligent enough to solve the problems, but the process of solving them is exhausting, if that makes sense.\n\nWhen I started this job I found it tiring but rewarding. I was surprised how good it felt to accomplish work, even if the business use for the software was not overly interesting. Now I just find it tiring, but given the idealness of the arrangement I have little faith changing companies would help long-term. I could try a new career, but I have near-term plans to take advantage of my flexibility and salary to move to a bigger city. And more generally, the pay and benefits of this industry are strong incentives for me to make this work, at least for another 5-10 years. Time off helps somewhat, but I always seem to regress back into this state.\n\nThis is a bit of a vent, but to ask some specific questions: Does this experience resonate with anyone? Does this sound like a patch of burnout, or am I trying to fit myself into a career I simply don't have the temperament for? And if it is burnout, how do I get the spark back?\n\nThanks",

I’ve travelled to most of Europe and US and the cities I like the most are Boston, Zurich and London, in this order.\n\nWhich of them do you think would be best for finding a balance between work, salary, life, good weather, and family (with 2 children) as a Software Engineer? Note that my partner works in IT support.\n\nMoving to Zurich is not that difficult with my EU nationality. In Zurich, except Google, and very few others, pay is quite low compared to the cost of living. Moving here is risky, as I dont want to bet my entire life on Google. Also, in Zurich healthcare is private, and can cost a lot for an entire family. Children are also expensive in Zurich. The chances of buying a flat in Zurich (around 1 milion CHF) are slim. I’d rather have a smaller salary and own my home, as my net worth would be effectively higher. Also, I’d have to learn swiss german, and my children would have to go to school and speak swiss german. They would probably not integrate properly in swiss society with parents that barely speak swiss german.\n\nIn London, there are so many options. There are more jobs than in Boston, Zurich, actually its the city with almost the most CS jobs in the world. Lots of companies offer 150k salaries. The problem in London is the tax system, as between 100k and 125k we are effectively taxed at ~61% and after 125k we are taxed at 45%. Buying a house in London is not as difficult as in Zurich, and there are many options of nice homes. London is a bit unsafe tho, and raising a family comes with additional challenges. Also the weather is too overcast, as Id rather live somewhere colder but sunnier, instead of somewhere with mild weather but cloudy and overcast.\n\nMoving to Boston would be the most difficult. It is feasible as I have a PhD and many first author research papers at reputable venues, so I could get an EB2 NIW green card visa. Buying a flat in Boston would be the easiest compared to London and Zurich. Boston is safer than London. Boston has the most high paying jobs compared to London and Zurich. It also has the most sunshine compared to London and Zurich. However, healthcare is private and I assume it would be expensive for an entire family. Also, I would have very little annual leave in Boston, as in Europe there are about 5 weeks of annual leave each year\n\n\n",

I’m in a strong position at my current company, and I’m up for a promotion in about 2 months that could bump my base salary from 180k CAD to around 200k CAD.\n\nI was recently approached by a much smaller product company, one with fewer than 500 employees. They’ve been in the digital experience space for quite some time but are not widely recognized and haven’t had much growth or market movement in recent years. They’ve offered me a very similar role to what I do today, but with a substantial base salary increase to around 245k CAD.\n\nNow I’m weighing the tradeoffs. On one hand, the new role pays significantly more but is a completely new tech stack. On the other hand, the company is relatively stagnant and lacks the industry visibility for their products (I work on a stack that is widely regarded the best while the new company’s product don’t feature in the top 10) and brand recognition. I’m trying to decide whether it’s worth leaving a stable and globally respected organization for the chance to earn more at a company with more risk and uncertainty. They’ve had a few rounds of quiet layoffs in the last 3-4 years and what seems like a general dip in momentum. I’m also unable to gauge how things are going as of today.\n\nIf anyone has made a similar move or has insight into this kind of decision, I’d love to hear your perspective.",

I've done a few side projects and 60 leetcode problems.

(i'm also fine with internships or just anything at this point) I'm looking for guidance \n\nto be honest, I feel like my brain knows what will land me the job.

It made me realize that for the past two years of college, I’ve been in autopilot mode. I completed assignments and passed classes, but I feel like I never deeply learned or retained the fundamentals of programming and cs theory.\n\nDespite that, the company surprisingly invited me to do a 90-minute follow-up whiteboarding session. I really want to redeem myself and prep properly. The task involves working on a Java project live, identifying bad coding practices, improving the code, and explaining my reasoning — kind of like a debugging/design/code-improvement challenge. I want to take this chance but I'm also nervous about embarrassing myself lol.\n\nMy issue is I feel like I’ve forgotten everything: syntax, core concepts, how to think like an engineer. I also struggle with memory/brain fog, so I tend to Google even basic things — but obviously that doesn’t work well in a live coding setting. Maybe I need a different approach to how I study code? When I do leetcode problems and such I do them but I don't know if they fully stick with me.\n\nAny advice or methods for how to quickly relearn and reinforce the fundamentals? Are there any structured courses or certs that helped you rebuild your CS foundation? Leetcode is helpful, but I feel like I need more than just solving problems — I need to understand why and how again.\n\nI know I might get some \"you're cooked\" comments, but I am really trying to get back into rhythm again.

I'm currently pursuing my B.S. in Software Engineering, with a minor in Environmental Science (I just think it's fun) and I intend to get another minor in Applied Data Science, just to diversify a little bit. I'm not particularly privileged, and I wouldn't be able to afford a degree at this university, but I am an employee there so I get multiple free courses each year and I am definitely using that benefit to the maximum extent I can while I work full time and save money.\n\n  \nOutside of work, I do have a very strong interest in electronics, engineering, computer science, etc; I find it fascinating, so as I progress through this degree, I won't have any issue building a portfolio outside of assigned projects. I have plenty of things I would love to do on my own that I just haven't acquired the knowledge for, with one of the main reasons being that I operate best when I have direction. Many of these projects (like setting up a home server with a connection to custom-made voice recognition software; basically building my own Alexa because I don't trust Amazon or Google) are things that I just don't have the toolset to even really get started with teaching myself easily. But smaller things, like refurbishing a boombox from the late 80's and adding a bluetooth remote, are things I have done because that tends to be smaller scale.\n\nAll of this is just to help show, I don't see this as a \"get rich quick\" scheme, and I'm not pursuing something I hate just to get the benefits; I'm just trying to maximize my return with a field that I have a natural interest in.\n\n  \nBut, beyond my B.S. and probable M.S., I'm really not sure what my ideal path would look like. Should I start looking for big companies to work for, to build up reputation? Is it enough to continue building a portfolio with private freelance projects, and if so, how would I even start to find those sorts of projects? What general field would be the most likely to work for this goal (full-stack development, network security consulting, etc)? \n\n  \nI know looking at all of this less than halfway through my B.S. is maybe a little ambitious, but I would rather get started on the right path sooner rather than later; I don't just want to coast through my degree with no real game plan afterwards, if that makes sense.\n\n  \nThank you for any advice or direction you can give, and I'll try to respond to any questions!\n\n  \n(And, for further context, I currently live in the EU, in Germany, so advice specific for here is doubly useful)",

        "content": "Hi! I’m hoping to get some perspective on whether I’m where I should be in my career, and what I should be focusing on over the next year.\n\nI graduated in 2022 and joined Microsoft as an L59 new grad. I got placed on a random Azure team doing pretty low-level, super product-specific work. Barely did any coding—most of my time went into looking at logs and tracing through old C++ systems. I wasn’t really building transferable skills, and I didn’t get much experience with C# or .NET either. This was super frustrating but it was what was it was.\n\nLate last year I was able to switch teams after getting promoted to L60. My new team works on an internal website and it’s been a WAY better fit. I’ve been doing mostly backend stuff and finally getting to get some exposure to coding in .NET. I’ve picked up a lot—dependency injection, JWTs, RBAC, separation of concerns, etc. \n\nI do rely on the VS/VS Code Copilot when I’m stuck or just don’t know how to start, and this frankly does worry me a lot. I try to dig in and understand what I’m doing, and I’ve learned a ton from my teammates, but I do worry about my ability to perform without it. On this team I’ve been able to handle tons of entirely different projects with plenty of success and I’ve ramped up very quickly since joining, and a big part of that has been using Copilot effectively to help me understand what I need to know and to at least provide a skeleton for me to iterate on. It adds to the frustration from the previous team since essentially none of the hard skills i’m using today were things I was exposed to then so in many ways it feels like I’m starting from scratch.\n\nThat said, my last stock vests in March 2026, and I’m planning to move cities and switch jobs. That’ll be 3.5 years in, and I’d like to be ready for SD2 roles by then. I might get promoted to L61 this fall, but even if I do I’m not confident I’d be able to thrive as an SD2 at a company like Meta or Google.\n\nTo prep, I’m planning to:\n\t•\tGrind LeetCode consistently\n\t•\tGo through Effective Java and Designing Data-Intensive Applications\n\t•\tKeep learning from my current team and writing as much code as I can\n\nBut it does still worry me that I’m behind where I should be and that if I make the switch I’ll be exposed. For anyone who’s made the jump to SD2 or switched companies around the 3-4 year mark—what helped you feel actually ready?\nAny advice on how I can close the gap in the next year? I get that some of this may be imposter syndrome, and i’ve struggled with that in the past, but I feel like on this team I’ve seen so many concrete examples of things I should know by now but don’t.\n\nAppreciate any thoughts.\n",

I applied on Friday, received the online assessment right away, completed it last night (both questions were easy to medium difficulty, and I passed all test cases), and just got notified that I’ve been moved forward to final interviews in the next 3 weeks.\n\nThe process feels a bit rushed, which makes me think they might be urgently backfilling roles—possibly due to recent departures or the \"hire-to-fire\" cycle some people mention. That said, I’ve also heard Amazon’s work culture can vary a lot depending on the team. I’d love to learn more about what the culture is like on teams that focus on embedded systems at Amazon.\n\nJoining Amazon could potentially increase my total compensation by 1.5x or even double compared to my current package. However, the risk of being let go within 6 to 12 months makes me seriously weigh how much effort I should invest in the upcoming interviews.",

My job is secure, low-stress, and laid-back, but I find writing test cases, improving frameworks, and manually testing tickets mind-numbingly dull. Meetings also feel unproductive.\nI’m grateful for the stability, and to have a job when so many talented people are struggling, but don’t feel fulfilled. I’m considering a switch to DevOps (or similar roles) for more engaging work. Is this a “grass is greener” trap? Has anyone moved from QA to DevOps or another field? Was it worth it, and how did you do it? I’m open to self-study or certifications—what should I focus on (e.g., AWS, Docker, CI/CD)?Thanks for any advice",

I recently gave notice at my job after 10 months, and I’m really second-guessing myself even though I *know* it was the right move.\n\nI worked at a small startup in a small tech ecosystem. I liked the people a *lot*, but I just never clicked with the product. It started affecting my energy, focus, and general drive—I’d show up late, avoid work, and just felt completely disconnected. That’s really not like me.\n\nToday, I gave my 30 days' notice to the CTO. She was disappointed and said I should’ve raised a flag earlier and that 10 months isn’t enough time to evaluate a job. And… maybe she’s right. That part’s really weighing on me.  \nBut who want to raise a flag? it's like saying fire me next?\n\nTo be clear, I wasn’t fired. I left on good terms I found another opportunity at a company I actually care about (coincidentally the one that acquired my old company a while back). They offered me more money and a better fi so logically, things are working out.\n\nBut emotionally? I feel like crap Really! Like I bailed too early. Like I failed some invisible test. Like I burned a bridge.\n\nHas anyone else gone through something like this?  \nHow did you move past the guilt and doubt?  \nIs leaving after 10 monthss really that bad in tech anymore?\n\nWould love to hear any thoughts.",

After graduating, I transitioned into a full-time role there as a C++ developer. After about a year, I left the software industry entirely to pursue a completely unrelated career path.\n\nAfter 1.5 years away, I’ve decided to return to software engineering. Since the beginning of university, I’ve always wanted to work in the field of computer graphics. Fortunately, I’ve been accepted into a reputable university to pursue a master’s degree focused on computer graphics.\n\nI have a few concerns and would appreciate any advice:\n\n\t1.\tThe market seems oversaturated since the end of the pandemic and with the rise of AI. While I have prior experience in software development, I haven’t worked specifically in graphics, and I also have a 1.5-year gap in the field due to switching careers. In this scenario, how difficult would it be for me to find a job after graduation?\n\n\t2.\tMy dream has always been to work at a big game studios, but salaries there aren’t always great. I’m also considering applying to MAANG companies. However, all the projects I’ll do during my master’s will be graphics-related. Would this kind of portfolio be a disadvantage when applying to MAANG companies?\n\n\t3.\tDoes age matter? Will companies still consider me even though there are younger candidates with perhaps more linear career paths?\n\nI’m not afraid of hard work and I’ve always been a top-performing student academically, but I have some doubts and would love to hear your thoughts and advice.
