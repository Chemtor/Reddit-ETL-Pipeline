        "author": "rocketinter",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In this opinionated article I am going to explain why I believe we have reached peak Spark usage and why it is only downhill from here.\n\n# Before Spark\n\nSome will remember that 12 years ago [Pig](https://pig.apache.org), [Hive](https://hive.apache.org), [Sqoop](https://sqoop.apache.org), [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org) and MapReduce were all the rage. Many of us were under the spell of [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org) during those times.\n\n# Enter Spark\n\nThe brilliant [Matei Zaharia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateizaharia/) started working on Spark sometimes before 2010 already, but adoption really only began after 2013.  \nThe lazy evaluation and memory leveraging as well as other [innovative features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0Tisli7zn4&t=97s) were a huge leap forward and I was dying to try this new promising technology.  \nMy then CTO was visionary enough to understand the potential and for years since, I, along with many others, ripped the benefits of an only improving Spark.\n\n# The Losers\n\nHow many of you recall companies like [Hortonworks](https://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Webinar.HDP2_.20131112.pdf) and [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/about.html)? Hortonworks and Cloudera merged after both becoming public, only to be taken private a few years later. Cloudera still exists, but not much more than that.\n\nThose companies were yesterday’s [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com) and they bet big on the Hadoop ecosystem and not so much on Spark.\n\n# Hunting decisions\n\nIn creating Spark, Matei did what any pragmatist would have done, he piggybacked on the existing Hadoop ecosystem. This allowed Spark not to be built from scratch in isolation, but integrate nicely in the Hadoop ecosystem and supporting tools.\n\nThere is just one problem with the Hadoop ecosystem…it’s exclusively **JVM based**. This decision has fed and made rich thousands of consultants and engineers that have fought with the [GC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) and inconsistent memory issues for years…and still does. The JVM is a solid choice, safe choice, but despite more than 10 years passing and Databricks having the plethora of resources it has, some of Spark's core issues with managing memory and performance just can't be fixed.\n\n# The writing is on the wall\n\nChange is coming, and few are noticing it ([some do](https://nolanlawson.com/2024/10/20/why-im-skeptical-of-rewriting-javascript-tools-in-faster-languages/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). This change is happening in all sorts of supporting tools and frameworks.\n\nWhat do [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), [Deno](https://deno.com), [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) and the Linux kernel all have in common that no one cares about...for now? They all have a Rust backend or have an increasingly large Rust footprint. These handful of examples are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nRust is the most prominent example and the forerunner of a set of languages that offer performance, a completely different memory model and some form of usability that is hard to find in market leaders such as C and C++. There is also Zig which similar to Rust, and a bunch of other languages that can be found in TIOBE's top 100.\n\nThe examples I gave above are all of tools for which the primary target are not Rust engineers but Python or JavaScipt. Rust and other languages that allow easy interoperability are increasingly being used as an efficient reliable backend for frameworks targeted at completely different audiences.\n\nThere's going to be less of \"by Python developers for Python developers\" looking forward.\n\n# Nothing is forever\n\nSpark is here to stay for many years still, hey, Hive is still being used and maintained, but I believe that peak adoption has been reached, there's nowhere to go from here than downhill. Users don't have much to expect in terms of performance and usability looking forward.\n\nOn the other hand, frameworks like [Daft](https://www.getdaft.io) offer a completely different experience working with data, no strange JVM error messages, no waiting for things to boot, just bliss. Maybe it's not Daft that is going to be the next best thing, but it's inevitable that Spark will be overthroned.\n\n# Adapt\n\nDatabricks better be ahead of the curve on this one.  \nInstead of using scaremongering marketing gimmicks like labelling the use of engines other than Spark as *Allow External Data Access*, it better ride with the wave.",

        "content": "I’ve benchmarked it. For use cases in my specific industry it’s something like x5, x7 more efficient in computation. It looks like it’s pretty revolutionary in terms of cost savings. It’s faster and cheaper.\n\nThe problem is PySpark is like using a missile to kill a worm. In what I’ve seen, it’s totally overpowered for what’s actually needed. It starts spinning up clusters and workers and all the tasks. \n\nI’m not saying it’s not useful. It’s needed and crucial for huge workloads but most of the time huge workloads are not actually what’s needed.\n\nSpark is perfect with big datasets and when huge data lake where complex computation is needed. It’s a marvel and will never fully disappear for that.\n\nAlso Polars syntax and API is very nice to use. It’s written to use only one node. \n\nBy comparison Pandas syntax is not as nice (my opinion). \n\nAnd it’s computation is objectively less efficient.  It’s simply worse than Polars in nearly every metric in efficiency terms.\n\nI cant publish the stats because it’s in my company enterprise solution but search on open Github other people are catching on and publishing metrics.\n\nPolars uses Lazy execution, a Rust based computation (Polars is a Dataframe library for Rust). Plus Apache Arrow data format.\n\nIt’s pretty clear it occupies that middle ground where Spark is still needed for 10GB/ terabyte / 10-15 million row+ datasets. \n\nPandas is useful for small scripts (Excel, Csv) or hobby projects but Polars can do everything Pandas can do and faster and more efficiently.\n\nSpake is always there for the those use cases where you need high performance but don’t need to call in artillery. \n\nIts syntax means if you know Spark is pretty seamless to learn.\n\nI predict as well there’s going to be massive porting to Polars for ancestor input datasets.\n\nYou can use Polars for the smaller inputs that get used further on and keep Spark for the heavy workloads. The problem is converting to different data frames object types and data formats is tricky. Polars is very new.\n\nMany legacy stuff in Pandas over 500k rows where costs is an increasing factor or cloud expensive stuff is also going to see it being used.\n\n",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey All,\n\nI've had an incredible year and I feel extremely lucky to be in the position I'm in. I'm a relatively new DE, but I've covered so much ground even in one year.\n\nI'm not perfect, but I can feel my growth. Every day I am learning something new and I'm having such joy improving on my craft, my passion, and just loving my experience each day building pipelines, debugging errors, and improving upon existing infrastructure.\n\nAs I look back I wanted to share some gems or bits of valuable knowledge I've picked up along the way:\n\n* Showing up in person to the office matters. Your communication, attitude, humbleness, kindness, and selflessness goes a long way and gets noticed. Your relationship with your client matters a lot and being able to be in person means you are the go-to engineer when people need help, education, and fixing things when they break. Working from home is great, but there are more opportunities when you show up for your client in person.\n* pre-commit hooks are valuable in creating quality commits. Automatically check yourself even before creating a PR. Use hooks to format your code, scan for errors with linters, etc.\n* Build pipelines with failure in mind. Always factor in exception handling, error logging, and other tools to gracefully handle when things go wrong.\n* DRY - such as a basic principle but easy to forget. Any time you are repeating yourself or writing code that is duplicated, it's time to turn that into a function. And if you need to keep track of state, use OOP.\n* Learn as much as you can about CI/CD. The bugs/issues in CI/CD are a different beast, but peeling back the layers it's not so bad. Practice your understanding of how it all works, it's crucial in DE.\n* OOP is a valuable tool. But you need to know when to use it, it's not a hammer you use at every problem. I've seen examples of unnecessary OOP where a FP paradigm was better suited. Practice, practice, practice.\n* Build pipelines that heal themselves and parametrize them so users can easily re-run them for data recovery. Use watermarks to know when the last time a table was last updated in the data lake and create logic so that the pipeline will know to recover data from a certain point in time.\n* Be the documentation king/queen. Use docstrings, type hints, comments, markdown files, CHANGELOG files, README, etc. throughout your code, modules, packages, repo, etc. to make your work as clear, intentional, and easy to read as possible. Make it easy to spread this information using an appropriate knowledge management solution like Confluence.\n* Volunteer to make things better without being asked. Update legacy projects/repos with the latest code or package. Build and create the features you need to make DE work easier. For example, auto-tagging commits with the version number to easily go back to the snapshot of a repo with a long history.\n* Unit testing is important. Learn pytest framework, its tools, and practice making your code modular to make unit tests easier to create.\n* Create and use a DE repo template using cookiecutter to create consistency in repo structures in all DE projects and include common files (yaml, .gitignore, etc.).\n* Knowledge of fundamental SQL if valuable in understanding how to manipulate data. I found it made it easier understanding pandas and pyspark frameworks. ",

The input is around 30k rows. Output is the same because there's no filtering or aggregation; just creating new fields. No collect, count, or display statements (which would slow it down). \n\nThe main thing is a bunch of mappings I need to apply, but it depends on existing fields and there are various models I need to run. So the mappings are different depending on variable and model. That's where the for loops come in. \n\nNow I'm ***not*** iterating over the dataframe itself; just over 15 fields (different variables) and 4 different mappings. Then do that 10 times (once per model).\n\nThe worker is m5d 2x large and drivers are r4 2x large, min/max workers are 4/20. This should be fine. \n\nI attached a pic to illustrate the code flow.

That experience really excited me, so I started learning Python on my own. That’s when the idea of switching to IT—or something related to programming—began to grow in my mind.\n\nMaybe if I had been less insecure about the whole IT world (it’s a BIG challenge), I would’ve started earlier with the path and the courses. But you know how it goes—make plans and God laughs.\n\nRight now, I’ve already started taking some courses—introductions to Data Analysis and Data Science. But out of all the options, Data Engineering is the one I’ve liked the most. With the help of ChatGPT, some networking on LinkedIn, and of course Reddit, I now have a clearer idea of which courses to take. I’m also planning to pursue a Master’s in Big Data.\n\nAnd the big question remains:\nIs it actually possible to switch careers?\n\nI’m not expecting to land the perfect job right away, and I know it won’t be easy.

They do a great job tracking metadata, but stop short of doing what seems like the next obvious step, actually helping enforce data access policies.\n\nImagine a unified catalog that isn't just a metadata registry, but also the gatekeeper to data itself:\n\n- Roles defined at the catalog level map directly to roles and grants on underlying sources through credential-vending.\n\n- Every access, by a user or a pipeline, goes through the catalog first, creating a clean audit trail.\n\nIceberg’s REST catalog hints at this model: it stores table metadata and acts as a policy-enforcing access layer, managing credentials for the object storage underneath.\n\nWhy not generalize this idea to all structured and unstructured data? Instead of just listing a MySQL table or an S3 bucket of PDFs, the catalog would also vend credentials to access them. Instead of relying on external systems for access control, the catalog becomes the control plane.\n\nThis would massively improve governance, observability, and even simplify pipeline security models.\n\nIs there any OSS project trying to do this today?\n\nAre there reasons (technical or architectural) why projects like DataHub and OpenMetadata avoid owning the access control space?\n\nWould you find it valuable to have a catalog that actually controls access, not just documents it?\n",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey all! \n\nOver the years, I’ve worked at companies as small as a team of 10 and at organizations with thousands of data engineers, and I’ve seen wildly different philosophies around analytical data.\n\nSome organizations go with the \"build it and they will come\" data lake approach, broadly ingesting data without initial structure, quality checks, or governance, and later deriving value via a medallion architecture.\n\nOthers embed governed analytical data directly into their user-facing or internal operations apps. These companies tend to treat their data like core backend services managed with a focus on getting schemas, data quality rules, and governance right from the start. Similar to how transactional data is managed in a classic web app.\n\nI’ve found that most data engineering frameworks today are designed for the former state, Airflow, Spark, and DBT really shine when there’s a lack of clarity around how you plan on leveraging your data. \n\nI’ve spent the past year building an open-source framework around a data stack that's built for the latter case (clickhouse, redpanda, duckdb, etc)—when companies/teams know what they want to do with their data and need to build analytical backends that power user-facing or operational analytics quickly.\n\nThe framework has the following core principles behind it:\n\n1. Derive as much of the infrastructure as possible from the business logic to minimize the amount of boilerplate\n2. Enable a local developer experience so that I could build my analytical backends right alongside my Frontend (in my office, in the desert, or on plane)\n3. Leverage data validation standards— like types and validation libraries such as pydantic or typia—to enforce data quality controls and make testing easy\n4. Build in support for the best possible analytical infra while keeping things extensible to incrementally support legacy and emerging analytical stacks\n5. Support the same languages we use to build transactional apps. I started with Python and TypeScript but I plan to expand to others\n\nThe framework is still in beta and it’s now used by teams at big and small companies to build analytical backends. I’d love some feedback from this community\n\nYou can take it for a spin by starting from a boilerplate starter project:[ https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart)\n\nOr you can start from a pre-built project template for a more realistic example:[ https://docs.fiveonefour.com/templates](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/templates)",

My IT experience comes from a pure layman interest in the subject where I have spent some time dabbing in python building scrapers, setting up RDBs, building scripts to connect everything and then building extraction scripts to do analysis. Ive done some scripting at work to automate annoying tasks. That said, I still consider myself a beginner.\n\nAt my workplace we are a bunch of consultants doing work mostly in excel, where we get lab data from external vendors. This lab data is then to be used in spatial analysis and comparison against regulatory limits. \n\nI have now identified 3-5 different ways this data is delivered to us, i.e. ways it could be ingested to a central DB. Its a combination of APIs, emails attachments, instrument readings, GPS outputs and more. Thus, Im going to try to get a very basic ETL pipeline going for at least one of these delivery points which is the easiest, an API.\n\nBecause of the way our company has chosen to operate, because we dont really have a fuckton of data and the data we have can be managed in separate folders based on project/work, we have servers on premise. We also have some beefy computers used for computations in a server room. So i could easily set up more computers to have scripts running. \n\nMy plan is to get a old computer up and running 24/7 in one of the racks. This computer will host docker+dagster connected to a postgres db. When this is set up il spend time building automated extraction scripts based on workplace needs. I chose dagster here because it seems to be free in our usecase, modular enought that i can work on one job at a time and its python friendly. Dagster also makes it possible for me to write loads to endpoint users who are not interested in writing sql against the db.  Another important thing with the db on premise is that its going to be connected to GIS software, and i dont want to build a bunch of scripts to extract from it.\n\nSome of the questions i have:\n\n* If i run docker and dagster (dagster web service?) setup locally, could that cause any security issues? Its my understanding that if these are run locally they are contained within the network\n* For a small ETL pipeline like this, is the setup worth it? \n* Am i missing anything?\n\n",

Would love to hear how you're pushing the limits of automated, intelligent data engineering.",

        "content": "Hey all,\n\nI’m using Snowflake for our data warehouse and just recently got our team set up with Git/source control. Now we’re looking to roll out either dbt or SQLMesh for transformations (I've been able to sell the team on its value as it's something I've seen work very well in another company I worked at).\n\nOne of the biggest unknowns (and requirements the team has) is tracking column-level lineage across dbt/SQLMesh and Power BI.\n\nEssentially, I want to find a way to use a DAG (and/or testing on a pipeline) to track dependencies so that we can assess how upstream database changes might impact reports in Power BI.\n\nFor example: if an employee opens a pull/merge request in GIT to modify TABLE X (change/delete a column), running a command like 'dbt run' (crude example, I know) would build everything downstream and trigger a warning that the column they removed/changed is used in a Power BI report.\n\nImportant: it has to be at a column level. Model level is good to start but we'll need both.\n\nHas anyone found good ways to manage this?\n\nI'd love to hear about any tools, workflows, or best practices that are relevant.\n\nThanks!",

Basically, it allows developers to use R2 object storage (which is S3 compatible) as a data lakehouse using Apache Iceberg. It already supports Spark (scala and pyspark), Snowflake and PyIceberg. For now, we have to run the query processing engines outside Cloudflare. [https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/)\n\nI find this exciting because it makes easy for beginners like me to get started with data engineering. I remember how much time I have spent while configuring EMR clusters while keeping an eye on my wallet. I found myself more concerned about my wallet rather than actually getting my hands dirty with data engineering. The whole product line focuses on actually building something and not spending endless hours in configuring the services.\n\nCurrently, Cloudflare has the following products which I think are useful for any data engineering project.\n\n1. Cloudflare Workers: Serverless functions.[Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)\n2. Cloudflare Workflows: Multistep applications - workflows using Cloudflare Workers.[Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/)\n3. D1: Serverless SQL database SQLite's semantics.[Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)\n4. R2 Object Storage: S3 compatible object storage.[Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)\n5. R2 Data Catalog: Managed Apache Iceberg data catalog which works with Spark (Scala, PySpark), Snowflake, PyIceberg [Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/)\n\n  \nI'd like your thoughts on this.",

Current connectors: PostgreSQL, Redis, filesystem—more coming soon.\n\nSolo side project, feedback welcome.\n\n[https://gitlab.com/liellahat/statql](https://gitlab.com/liellahat/statql)",

        "content": "Hello dear people! Been dealing with this very interesting problem that I'm not 100% sure how to tackle. A local forum went down some time ago and they lost a few hours worth of data since backups aren't hourly. Quite a few topics were lost, as well as some of them apparently became corrupted and also got lost. One of them included a very nice discussion about local mountaineering and beautiful locations which a lot of people are saddened to lost since we discussed many trails. Somehow, people managed to collect data from various cached sources, computers, some screenshots, but mostly old google, bing caches while they worked and webarchive. \n\nNow it's all properly ordered in pdf document but the thing is the layouts often change and so does resolution but the general idea of how data is represented is the same. There's also some artifacts in data from webarchive for example - they have an element hovering over text and you can't see it, but if you ctrl-f to search for it it's there somehow, hidden under the image haha. No javascript in PDF, something else, probably  colored, no idea.\n\nThe ideas I had were (btw PDF is OCR'd already):\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- PDF to text and try to regex + LLM process it all somehow?\n\n- Somehow \"train\" (if train is a proper word here?) machine vision / machine learning for each separate layout so that it knows how to extract data\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut I also face issue that some posts are for example screenshoted in \"half\", e.g. page 360 has the text cut out and continue on page 361 with random stuff on top from the archival's page (e.g. webarchive or bing cache info). I would need to also truncate this, but that should be easy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Or option 3 with those new LLMs that can somehow recognize images or work with PDF (idk how they do it) I could maybe have the LLM do the whole heavy load of processing? I could pick up one of better new models with big context length and remembrance, I just checked total character count, it's 8.588.362 characters or 2.147.090 tokens approximately, but I believe the data could be split and later manually combined or something? I'm not sure I'm really new to this. The main goal is to have a nice json output with all data properly curated.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMany thanks! Much appreciated.",

        "content": "Hi y’all. A little background on my situation: I graduated with a BA last year and am planning on attending law school for my JD here in Canada in fall 2026. Getting into law school in Canada is really competitive, so as a backup plan, I’m considering starting an additional degree in data science in case law school doesn’t work out. My previous degree was almost completely free due to scholarships, and since I’m in the process of joining the military I can get a second degree subsidized.   \n\nI already have a BA, so I would like to use elective credits from my previous degree toward a BSc if that’s the route I take. The only issue is that a lot of Canadian universities don’t allow you to transfer credits from previously earned degrees. Because of this, I’ve been looking into less prestigious but equally accredited school options. \n\nMy concerns are mostly about co-op opportunities, networking, and how much school reputation influences your earning potential and career growth in this field. I know that law is pretty much a meritocracy in Canada, but the alumni connections made through your university can mean the difference between tens of thousands of dollars per year. \n\nIdeally, I want to go to a school that has strong co-op programs to gain experience, and would potentially want to do an honours thesis or project. I’ve spoken to some people in CS and they’ve recommended I just do a CE boot camp, or take a few coding classes at a community college and then pursue a MS in data science. I don’t like either of these suggestions because I feel that I wouldn’t have as strong a theoretical background as someone who completed a 4 year undergrad degree. \n\nAny insight would be really helpful!

The lot basically. Why are these comments so hidden to our users whilst they're actually writing the queries that make use of these tables, columns, etc?\n\nOur team goes to a decent amount of effort to build useful and readable documentation around each table but is it any use if the end users have to pull up the docs in a separate tab before they understand that they're using the wrong column for their joins?\n\nThis feels like something that's not too hard to implement, I know having objects tagged with a comment or description is already a nice to have in the data world but surely we can do better?

We also get a \"prior month\" report each day of the data from the full prior month. Finally, we also may get a \"year to date\" file with all of the data from the start of the year to current date.\n\nNothing in the data export itself gives us an \"as of date\" for the record (the source system uses proprietary information to give us the data that \"falls\" within that range). All we have is the date range for the individual export to go off of.\n\nI'm struggling to figure out how to model this data. Do I simply use three different \"fact\" models? One each for \"daily\" (sourced from the current month file), \"monthly\" (sourced from the prior month file), and \"yearly\" (sourced from the year to date file)? If I do that, how do I handle the different grains for the SCD Type 2 DIM table of the data? What should the VALID\\_FROM/VALID\\_TO columns be sourced from in this case? The daily makes sense (I would source VALID\\_FROM/VALID\\_TO from the \"end\" date of the data extract that keeps bumping out each day), but I don't know how that fits into the monthly or yearly data.\n\n  \nAny insight or help on this would be really appreciated.\n\nThank you!!",

I feel like my company's practices are very sloppy and I am the only one that cares. We dont have good environment separation as many DE's do dev in a single snowflake account that is pointed at production AWS where there is PII and PHI. The level of access is concerning to me not only for leakage, but this goes against the best practices for development that I've always known. I've started an initiative to build separate dev,stage, prod accounts with masked data in the lower environments, but this always gets put on the back burner for urgent client asks. Looking for a sanity check as I wonder, at times, if I am overthinking it. I would love to know how others have dealt with access to production data. Do your DE's work in a separate cloud account or separate set of servers? Is PII/PHI allowed in the environments where dev work is being done?",

As soon as the queries get complex, the time to complete skyrockets. \n\nI started using duckDB and that helped tremendously. The only issue was the scaffolding every time just so I could do some querying was tedious and the overall experience is pretty terrible when you compare writing SQL in a notebook or script vs an editor.\n\nI liked the duckDB UI but the non-persistent nature causes a lot of headache. This led me to build [soarSQL](https://soarsql.com/) which is a duckDB powered SQL editor. \n\nsoarSQL has quickly become my default SQL editor at work because it makes working with OLTP databases a breeze. On top of this, I get save a some money each month because I the bulk of the processing happens on my machine locally!\n\nIt's free, so feel free to give it a shot and let me know what you think!",

Is there design pattern or architecture that could work well with this?\n\nI already built an Object-Oriented code but I want to optimize things and also make it less complicated as I feel that my current code looks too messy for the job, which is definitely in part due to my inexperience in such use cases.",

Unfortunately, none of these can handle the larger data we have with a reasonable amount of RAM. They can do the processing and write to disk without partitioning, but we get OOM when we try to partition by day. I've tried a few workarounds such as partitioning by year, and then reading the yearly files one at a time to re-partition by day, and still OOM.\n\nAny suggestions on how we could implement this, preferably without having to migrate to a distributed solution?",

What the hell is happening?\n\nLike, how do people do things to somehow turn their code into a GUI on the screen? How does the text pop up? How can I manipulate the pixels on monitor to make my own GUI? I wasn't taught anything about this stuff and it feels like the programming I was being taught was extremely shallow. I can code a binary tree, I know about pointers and classes, but that's about it. I could make text based stuff, but how do I study the code on a deeper level? I know I could probably just import a GUI library and use it, but I don't want to just use a library, I want to understand how this technical stuff (that my school didn't teach) works.\n\nAre there any resources on how I can learn how computers work on a deeper level?\n\nSorry for the newbie rambling.

It felt like a huge achievement, especially given how competitive it was.\n\nLast fall semester, I was given a project that was honestly much harder than anything I had worked on before. I started experiencing a lot of imposter syndrome, and to make things worse, I realized I really struggle with public speaking—something that became a big challenge during group presentations. Even though it was tough, I stuck with it as much as I could until the final weeks of the semester. But then, I completely panicked and ended up skipping the final presentation, ignoring both my teammates and professors.\n\nAs a result, I ended up failing the course and got kicked out of the CS program. Now, I’m back at home, feeling completely stuck and unsure what to do next. I can’t help but regret the way I handled everything, especially the missed opportunity. I know I let my fear and lack of confidence get the best of me, but I don’t know how to move forward.\n\nI guess I’m asking for advice from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or just has some perspective on what my next steps should be.

Sure its productive and a cool functionality. But... I just cant shake the feeling that it might not be good (esp as a beginner). And i see how this can translate to AI and potentially forming bad syntax habits. \n\nSo yeah, was wondering what IDE or text editor you all use, why, and what quirks/functions do you guys love or hate. Can be for any programming languages or markup languages. ",

        "content": "It's going  be a somewhat long post.. maybe it'll be removed idk.\n\nSo I'm about to get my [B.tech](http://B.tech) CS degree in few months. And looking back it went by pretty quickly.  Last few days I've been asking myself what did I do all those years ?  Not enough.\n\n**why I started programming ?**  \nI really loved games but I had to pay money for in-app purchases and some things I didn't like. So I started modifying simple games.  But for many games those simples tricks didn't work , so I though \" well fuck you , I'm going to learn to make games, and make a game similar to this and play however I want \".\n\n**A little bit of Backstory , not  interesting , skip to next part**\n\nI started with **C** cuz someone in my village told  me with little bit of knowledge said you should start with C it will give you strong base ( still thankful for him ).\n\nLearned basic of C on mobile cuz I didn't have Desktop or Laptop. Learned till functions and stuff. Then study pressure increased for core subject and no one in my village has any Idea about programming. My parents also told me to focus on main study first then do all this later.\n\nI was a very competitive back then.. I was top of my class and really wanted to learn more. so I studied  Physics and Chemistry of 1 year further.  And when I was in 3rd year Highschool I moved out to a near town because my village didn't have any good schools or teacher.\n\nAnd then I had my first taste of true Freedom , so I said fuck it , I've studied everything in syllabus for 3rd year so I'm gonna rest for this semester and enjoy.  and Fuck me then  all of sudden I was in Final year . And It was almost 1.5 years since I had touched any books or any study material.  I was about to fail my Final Exams which was due in few months ( during COVID ) , so I started cramming 16+ hours to study. I was not going to Fail I made that sure but I was not about to get good marks.  But exams got cancelled due to COVID and we were marked based on previous years marks. So I got decent marks for my Final year of Highschool.\n\nThen without any delay I got into a University. I didn't wanted to wait to clear entrance exams for Good colleges cuz I knew I've fucked myself.\n\nI got in college and didn't attend college ( It was mixed of Online / Offline ) , cuz I had developed crippling social anxiety from all those years in isolation.\n\nAnd I barely passed my first year. I nearly failed. I had never got marks like this in my entire fucking life. I was ashamed of myself.  It was a waking call for me . I started to take studies somewhat seriously.\n\n\\--------------------------------------- **END OF BACKSTORY** \\-----------------------------------------------\n\nAnd almost 4 years have passed by...\n\n**what do I know and what have I done ?**\n\n* **C** :  Learned enough to clear exams\n* **C++** : I've always wanted to develop games , so People told me It's the best and all Powerful ( It took me good fucking time to dwell a bit deeper into it . cuz I had to study for college assignments and exams. And I remember in a semester we had to study (JavaScript , HTML, CSS, Python, R , Julia , SQL ).I couldn't focus on it. And of course resource which teach C++ like C. I only used Reddit before for memes and other stuff. But then I searched for programming related sub and I found this sub. This sub has pulled from the Depth of Abyss and I'm not even exaggerating. I found good resources to learn from here and followed them. C++ was different and I really loved it and still do and I've never found C++ to be overly complicated , it's makes sense to me.  I made some petty Games , which I enjoyed creating and playing.\n* **Python** : It's very easy after C++, I made some simple scripts for automated file backup to drive and  batch image editing and other things.\n* **Assembly(x86-64)** : Started learning it to flex , but It improved my programing. I don't understand how. I can read assembly but I can only write basic programs ( like vector maths, factorial etc ) .\n\nThese are the only things I've done in past 4 years. I've nothing interesting to show for apart from good GPA and theoretical knowledge ( not much but more than the people around me ).  Only thing that somewhat makes me feel good that I've done it with the help of strangers and myself. NO help from college , they'll just provide degree.\n\n**What I'm planning next ? and Why ?**\n\nI got a job offer of decent pay but I rejected cuz It was Data Science and A.I related and I'm not interested in those.\n\nI wanted to take Game development seriously but got fucked by Maths. So I decided to start it again and I'm making progress slowly . I'll jump to Game dev once I've solid understanding of Game Maths. and maths in general.\n\nI plan on doing [M.tech](http://M.tech) , I'm lucky and really grateful that I have financial support from my Father ,  But this time I'll do it from a Good University this time.  So I'm planning to drop for this year and prepare.\n\n**Biggest Question ?**\n\nDeep Down I still don't know what do I want to do ? I love to programming  and will do it without getting paid . I'll learn things even nobody needs it.  But in time I'll have to take responsibility and have a Job that pays so I don't stay dependent on my Father.\n\nMy question is how do you know if it's the right thing to do ?  I've thought about this for months and months now...\n\n**I've 3 main things that comes to my mind :**\n\n\\- Become a Professor  : I really love to teach , I've taught few of my Juniors and I've loved every moment of it.\n\n\\- Become a Game Dev: I've cool concepts and story , but I lack skill , but I can learn them.\n\n\\- Or get into High Frequency Trading ( HFT )\n\nI really can't chose , cuz I really wanna go deeper into one of those areas during my 2 years of M.tech.\n\nI can spend time with stuff  If it fascinates me and with Time I can learn it.\n\n**TLDR : 4 years of CSE studied completed don't know what to do with my life ? I have multiple interests and I wanna explore more.**\n\n**I would really appreciate some knowledge, wisdom and insights from people who are into this field .**  **I really want someone to told me what you're doing is fine ...  or be blunt and tell me you're fucking stupid. Just no in between.**",

That is simply how I understood it so I made a post in case there might be others.\n\n\n\nI often see comments on posts, asking how to learn programming, saying not to use AI.\n\nAlthough I am definitely no professional programmer myself, I have done quit a lot of learning (python, c#, and lately c++). I have always heeded this advice and have steered far away from using AI to learn how to code. Until the last couple of weeks.... and I have completely changed my mind about the subject.\n\nI still think it is a bad idea to have AI write up some copy-paste code as this definitely is not the best way to go about learning. Struggling a little and trying to get the code working yourself is what will cement the knowledge. But what I have been doing is submitting my code snippets to the AI after getting it to work and prompting it to analyze my code and suggest possible improvements. I then try implementing the suggestions and repeat the process.\n\nI feel this has vastly upgraded my programming skills, learning to implement fail safes, better error handling, better edge case handling, and being overall more robust. Still by no means am I any form of 'great' programmer yet but using Ai in this way has helped me progress a lot faster.\n\nSo, in my opinion there is no problem with using AI to help you learn, the problem is in how we decide to use it. Just my two cents.",

I’ve been practicing and taking Udemy courses in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for about a year now, maybe a little more. I’ve managed to get a decent grasp of both technologies. I can create a static page using HTML and CSS, and I can add a bit of interactivity with JavaScript and understand it somewhat. Of course, I’m not capable of building a large application yet, but I understand a lot more than when I first started.\nLately, I’ve been feeling insecure and anxious, wondering if maybe it’s already too late for me to pursue this. When I look for junior jobs, there seem to be literally none.\nI really enjoy the fact that I can see what I create — like building a page, an accordion, a navigation bar, or dynamically hiding or adding something. Being able to actually see what I make is something I love.\nMy plan B would be to quickly take some fiber optics classes and move towards networking, but I don’t think it would take me as far.\nIs it already too late for me to get into web development? 33yr old btw ;(\n",

        "author": "hello_aaron",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI hope you’re all doing well. I’m reaching out because I’m struggling with a severe lack of focus and productivity, and it’s been weighing on me for nearly a year. Let me share my story and explain where I’m at – I’d really appreciate any guidance or experiences you can share.\n\nBackground: In 2021, I got my first desktop from my brother, and I was instantly hooked on computers. I spent hours exploring, learning, and diving into coding. I started with C, moved to C++, and fell in love with programming. It was exciting, and I was learning something new every day. In 2022, I joined a Computer Science Engineering program as a direct second-year student. This was the peak of my productivity. I was coding 10+ hours a day, building web development projects with Python and JavaScript, and even mastering the MERN stack. I was so focused that I’d code through the night, feeling like coding was my entire world. My hard work paid off – I became one of the top coders in my college, and my peers recognized my skills. I built a strong portfolio and improved my resume, aiming for a developer job\n\nProblem: Things changed in my final year (2024). I started feeling depressed, demotivated, and lazy. I couldn’t focus on learning new skills or even maintaining my existing ones. While my peers were landing interviews and jobs, I struggled with aptitude tests (which I hadn’t prepared for, as I was so focused on coding). Sitting down to work on my laptop became a challenge – I just felt unmotivated. Despite this, I pushed through, and my past hard work paid off: I landed the highest-paying job at a major MNC in my college. I’m proud of this, but the problem persists. Now, with my degree wrapping up in the next 2-3 months, I want to use this time to improve myself, but I can’t focus on anything. I’ve lost the drive to learn new languages or build projects. Worse, I’m experiencing back pain from too much screen time, which makes me avoid my laptop altogether. I suspect I’m addicted to high-dopamine activities like gaming and YouTube Shorts, which make it impossible to start anything productive. My mind feels like it’s rejecting coding and my laptop for no clear reason.\n\nI’ve attempted every productivity strategy. I desperately want to be that person again who could code all day without distractions, but I feel stuck. This has been going on for almost a year, and I’m worried about starting my job in this unmotivated state. Has anyone else experienced this shift from being passionate and productive to feeling unmotivated and unable to focus? How did you overcome it?\n\nI’d love to hear your experiences, suggestions, or even just know I’m not alone in this. Thank you so much in advance for your help!",

Is this true? Additionally, would it be possible for me to learn Java and Python within this time frame? I will probably have around two-three hours to work on it every single day. \n\nLastly, should I learn a different language rather than python? ",

Now I've got a really good idea of what I want to do, but the whole self learning pipeline is extremely intimidating because I have TOO many options.\n\nThere's so many different ways to get into this industry, and while I eventually want to get into machine learning and data science (and programming my own personal project for fun), I understand that it will probably take years to get into those fields. So my understanding is that a QA tester position would be a solid start as it commonly uses python just like the late game fields I want to get into.\n\nAnd a good start would be appreciated cus I'm totally broke!\n\nI'm starting with CS50's python course, and I know I need to create my own personal projects and stuff like leetcode to put in my portfolio.\n\nIf anyone has any recommendations, direction, advice or would like to point out that my logic is sound or messed up, please let me know!",

Besides interviewing myself once in a while for practice, I've also been involved in interviewing candidates at my company.\n\nAfter enough exposure on both sides of the table, something became pretty clear to me: Being able to solve problems isn’t what sets you apart. Explaining them is.\n\nSolving a question correctly is important, of course. But what really stands out is how clearly and naturally someone can walk others through their thought process. It’s not about over-narrating or reciting a rehearsed script. What makes a difference is:\n\nFraming your approach in simple, accessible terms  \n\nSurfacing trade-offs before you're even asked  \n\nStaying steady and unfazed when edge cases come up, as if you already thought about them  \n\nBecause of this, I gradually adjusted how I prepare for interviews, even casual ones. I still solve problems as usual, but now I also practice summarizing the solution in one or two clean sentences, basically a \"30-second version\", then being ready to dive deeper if needed.\n\nSometimes, I’ll use a tool that offers multiple solution paths and points out which parts are worth verbalizing, not just coding. It’s helped me avoid slipping into the \"just code it\" mindset.\n\nCurious if others have similar experiences. How do you practice improving the communication side of problem-solving, especially without sounding overly scripted?",

I guess it would be Upwork that I would be looking at for freelance work.\n\nI'm aware that most people recommend a few years of experience as an employee before making a transition to freelance. I'm not opposed to going the FT employee route but, due to my current position as being quite remote and based a long way from central / western timezones, I am concerned that the odds would be quite heavily stacked against me during applications, vs junior developers who are already based on the doorstep of hiring companies or at least in more accessible timezones.\n\nIs freelancing a viable first gig in 2025, or should I prioritize FT employment? \n\nWould really appreciate any pointers, thanks",

The guy checks again until he finds another bug, writes to you and waits\n6. Repeat following steps ad nasium\n\nI think this is quite popular approach to do reviews but it is also infuriating and generates huge waste of time\n\nIt is much faster to get comprehensive list of issues with the reviewed code and publish one batch of fixes that generating hundred of one-line patches, escpecially when pushing code fir review triggers CI job\n\nHow do you feel about this topic?

I barely am able to code and when I code, I need to check countless times on how to write specific commands or even very general basic ones. I feel how the pressure and difficulty is getting into my head when I need to program for a project and I cannot deal with it very well. I try to visualize my code in my head but I cant.

I used to be the smart kid in school and a smart adult nowadays but when I compare myself to the other students in my course, I feel trashy and I feel like theres a big wall of missing understanding that keeps me away from reaching the potential and skills they did. I try many times to just pick everything up and learn it but every time I just fall to my knees, feeling simply overwhelmed.\n\nI dont want to use AI to write my programs, doing that led me to not practise enough honestly.

        "content": "I was exceptionally lucky, in this job market, to get a position as a junior following a boot camp. I am so pleased but I really did go in knowing almost nothing at all.\n\nI’ve now been at the company as a front end developer for 1.5 years and I can now complete my tasks mostly independently. However I still constantly feel like I don’t really know what I’m doing. I worry that I’ve just got good at doing the specifics in my company but if I were to move somewhere else I’d basically be brand new again. \n\nFor the first year I was doing a lot of learning and continuing learning in the evenings with my own projects. However for the last 6 months I’ve felt like I’ve got to a point where my brain feels so full I cannot take anything more in and I feel I haven’t really improved. \n\nThere are still so many things at work that I don’t understand. In the last couple of weeks been asked to help out on another project which is much bigger than I am used to and getting my head around the code, all the components and types and where everything is being imported from and the structure of it all feels overwhelming. There’s so many custom hooks and so many components. I am managing tasks but requiring more help than I’d like. \n\nOn one hand I do feel pleased that I’ve got to a point where I can do this job, as my bootcamp was really nowhere near the minimum required to function in my role. However I’m worried that I’m lagging behind and my progress has stalled. I see some people come in new and they seem to have picked up a lot more than me in their first year. \n\n- I wonder if it’s partly my age. I’m a career changer in my 30s with a toddler and I really think I’ve lost the ability to learn as quickly as I once did. It’s not that I believe I am incapable of learning new things but perhaps I should accept it might take longer. \n\n- I wonder if it’s also that I have a lot of gaps in my knowledge as I don’t have the basic foundational understanding of computer science that a lot of my colleagues with CS degrees are coming in with. Would it be worth doing specifically some CS courses do you think? \n\nIs there any advice for this “head too full” feeling where I feel I can’t take anymore in? It’s been going on for months now and it’s like my brain is always so tired even though I’ve not really been learning a lot recently. \n\nThank you in advance. ",

We started with Logic and problem solving and diving into mongo and atlas before going into vscode,which is where my problem started. Most if not all of my classmate already know how to code, most of them are in this program for the  scholarship or opportunity of going outside the country to study and apply for a job. And theirs me, someone who was using Mimo coding app to learn about programming last year and can only use html to write(hello world, how is your day going) and people who are using html to code an entire website. I digress, we started vocode and how teacher that taught us how to code with the programming language but didn't go into it, and the following week put us in groups of 6 for a project, for us to pick out of 6 subject and make a website out of it. Which shock me because we just started and I'm still railing in the fact that I am not even good at any language even html which I started doing online last year and now we are to build a website. The others weren't conflicted like I was. And it was then I learnt almost all of them already know how to code so to them this was not difficult, but to me it was I was nothing in this class. I saw the guy who was in our group the following day and what he did with the vscode shock me because, line's upon line's  of code done in a single day, each page on the vscode I could  not understand. He proposed he will handle the website will the rest of us handle how will present it, which fill my heart with grace because if I was called to contribute anything to creation of the website, I will have nothing to say. Other groups to, their where people who were coding like it was nothing and it ashamed me, it made me feel like I was retarded.  I use to tell my self I will design games or build software and get a job as a programmer and now I know nothing and it feels insulting. Anyway we showed our result and we good. And 2 weeks ago we started java, If I have to say it easy, I followed well, coding was easing with java on intellija and it was a boost on my confidence that I was following and understanding with this time I believe I was with the class. Then came yesterday, we did a solar planet code with just the shape, distance to the sun and if lifeexist. Now we are told to perform the program will all the properties of all 8 planet. This type of assignment are to test ourselves put how will I do it and the with java. That is the problem, am I cut out for this. Should I just us AI, I don't know there are still more courses if I'm falling at this what about the rest  ",

Only a master's degree. I'm planning on immigrating after graduation.\n\nIn my university the first 3 years are spent learning common computer science stuff: some web development, some software engineering and many different programming languages. The next 2 years you specialize in a specific field of computer science like mobile apps, data science, software engineering, web development etc etc. I'm thinking of specializing in either software engineering or video game development.\n\nThe thing is I'm not passionate about computer science. I'm only doing it because it's the best path for immigration. i don't like it because It has a very low margin of error. It's stressful and I'm not passionate about the final product (software/websites). Although I know some people are passionate about it and I definetly respect that!\n\nSo I'm thinking about video game development because I might be into the product that I'm developing. But on the other hand software engineering opens up more job opportunities. But on the other hand, again, I already studied it during the first 3 years and many people who graduate from my university can get jobs in different fields than the one they specialized in, so even if I specialize in video game development I might get a software engineering job.\n\nMy biggest priority is immigrating and I hope to do that by being able to land a job abroad.\n\nAny advice is welcome!",

When someone wants to work on a new feature, he creates a new branch and when the feature is done, he creates a pull request to the master branch, but we've encountered some problems with this system, especially when it comes to merge conflicts. The solution I think is the best is to merge the master branch locally to the feature branch and resolve the conflicts, push it, and then merge it to master. This works only because after the merge to the feature branch, the merge to the master's common ancestor and master branch tip is the same, so whatever is in the feature branch gets accepted. Is there a better system for this and is my understanding correct?",

        "author": "Hazjut",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "TL;DR:\nAfter years of chasing a tech career that never paid or stabilized, I am leaving for a career that can support a family and offer real security. I still love tech, but I had to move on to survive.\n\n\nI thought tech would be the future I built my life on. It didn’t work out.\n\nI chased a tech career for years, but it never came together. Ironically, I made the equivalent of around $80k a year in the military before I even had a degree, and some years a bit more. After graduating, despite years of effort, I never made over $80k again. After unstable contracts, low pay, no benefits, and rising living costs, I found a different career starting around $140k total comp and quickly climbs toward $200k and beyond, offering real retirement options and meaning that tech never did for me.\n\nI started coding for fun at 16, back in 2006. It was not rare, but it was far less common than it is today. When college came, I should have taken on debt and jumped into tech earlier. But I saw loans like credit card debt, and my family did too. We did not understand grants or aid. I was the first in my family to pursue a degree. Instead, I joined the military to pay for college.\n\nWhile serving, I started taking tech seriously. I built projects, took classes early, and did well both academically and physically. I am a combat veteran. After leaving, I moved to a major west coast city, earned a degree from a respected state university, and started trying to build a tech career.\n\nI completed two internships at large tech companies, but after graduating around the time layoffs began sweeping the industry, I could not find work for about a year. When I finally broke in, I spent the next few years grinding through mostly contract roles, including development, support, and program management, at two FAANG companies. Most paid well under $80k, with no benefits. Even working over 40 hours a week, I was barely surviving. And it left me drained trying to find new work throughout those three years while I worked over 40 hours. I had eventually applied to thousands of jobs even though many were targeted applications. It was consuming my life with no benefit.\n\nOver the last few years, I interviewed for about 20 roles, but nothing stuck. Pay stagnated, inflation rose, contracts ended, interviews were canceled mid-process because of layoffs and outsourcing. I did not want to leave tech. But eventually, the cost of living made it impossible to stay. I am starting a family and I want to buy a home, and the path I was on in tech could not support either.\n\nI needed something meaningful I could rely on for career growth and stability. That is when I turned to law enforcement. It shares some overlap with the military in structure, though it is not the same. For me the constant deployments were the only thing I didn't enjoy, and this is the closest I could find that felt similar without needing to travel overseas constantly. It felt like a better fit for the life I needed to build.\n\nNow, I am starting my new career. In many major west coast cities, law enforcement compensation surprisingly matches or beats the tech roles I once chased. Retirement comes in your early 50s if you want it, without penalty. I plan to use my GI Bill for a master's degree and eventually specialize in areas like police forensics. It is already improving my quality of life.\n\nI am mourning the career and identity I once imagined. But I am hopeful about what lies ahead. This path will eventually give me the freedom, disposable income, and stability to return to tech on my own terms, whether that means building my own product, starting a company, or, if nothing else, creating open-source tools that still have real impact. It may not look like the dream I once had, but it might be a better one.\n\nFor now, it is another opportunity for someone else who loves this field the way it demands. I am finally choosing a path that fits me, and I do not regret it.",

I am talking about chronic, soul-sucking, life-flattening exhaustion. Every day feels like running a marathon at a sprinter's pace. There is an endless barrage of Slack messages, Jira tickets, unexpected urgent meetings, and late-night pings that just need a quick review. Every quarter feels like another round of brutal performance reviews where you are judged against metrics that seem to move the second you get close to hitting them.\n\nEven my friends who made it into the actual FAANG companies are not living the dream. They are constantly worried about the next round of layoffs. They are stuck in environments where one minor mistake can tank their rating and put their career at risk. Some are taking anxiety medication now. Some do not even enjoy coding anymore, something that used to be their passion. It has been hard to watch.\n\nAnd then there are my other friends.\n\nThe ones I used to quietly judge. The ones who went into banking tech, insurance companies, healthcare systems, government contractors. The so-called safe non-tech companies.\n\nWhen we catch up, the contrast is hard to ignore. They work 20 to 30 hours a week. They log off by 4 PM, laptops closed until the next morning. No emergency production issues in the middle of the night. No hyper-aggressive performance reviews. No constant fear about the next reorg or layoff. Their companies are profitable and stable and not reacting to every market fluctuation with mass job cuts.\n\nThey are happy. Genuinely happy.\n\nThey have hobbies. They go hiking. They build side projects for fun. They go to the gym without feeling guilty. They spend time with family, with friends, with themselves. They are not worried about falling behind because their companies are not built on a culture of constant comparison.\n\nWhen I look at them now, I see peace. A peace I forgot was even possible in this industry.\n\nI was so obsessed with winning early on that I did not realize how much I was sacrificing along the way. My health. My happiness. My actual life outside of work. I thought prestige would make it all worth it, but you cannot deposit mental stability into a bank account. You cannot get back the years of stress you burned through trying to chase a logo on a resume.\n\nI am proud of what I have achieved. But if I could go back and tell my younger self one thing, it would be this: ***Prestige is not everything. Stability and happiness matter more than any brand name ever will.***\n\nTo anyone out there grinding away and feeling miserable but telling themselves it will all be worth it once they get to the next step. Please remember that you are allowed to choose a different path. You are allowed to choose yourself over the brand. It is not giving up. It is winning in a different way.",

I don’t know if I’m super lucky but… CS has been a good and easy field for me.\n\nI have graduated from an average european engineering school. Did a three year apprenticeship in an average company. Moved to Switzerland and tripled my salary. A couple years later changed company and I’m almost at 160k fixed salary.\n\nAll that and… I’m not a super good developer. Honestly, compared to my peers I would say I’m slightly (very slightly) above average. I never did leetcode. I havent read a CS book in the last 10 years. I don’t keep up with new technologies (I’m a Java dev and I dont know what’s the latest version).\n\nBut hey, looking back on my career, I do think I have a few positive points that made me get here :\n\n- I have more social skills than 90% of my dev colleagues. Yes this in an stereotype. Some of the best developers I met are completely autistic. These guys can’t hold a normal conversation for 5 minutes. Let alone when there’s a woman in the conv\n\n- Learn languages. I’m one of the only ones on my team who can write in english correctly and speak without a heavy accent. I have been put in so many meetings just because I spoke english. Languages really open doors.\n\n- I never refused work. Whenever my boss asks me to do some menial, non-interesting, boring task… I just do it. When someone needs to do it, I volunteer for it. Really, it’s that simple, even if the task is dumb\n\n- When someone asks you do somethint, always ask for a ticket or an email. You’re not a decision taker, you’re a developer. This will get you out of trouble.\n\n- Be friends with people from other  : have a DBA friend, have a DevOps friend, have a Sec engineer friend. You’ll need them. \n\nThat’s it guys. It’s plain, simple and everyone can do it but most people won’t do it\n\n\n",

Maybe your prep will help you. Maybe it won't. \n\nExercising on the other hand has a guaranteed ROI in terms of improved mental clarity. That extra mental sharpness is also often needed during interviews.\n\nSo skipping the gym to give yourself more preparation time is never a wise trade-off. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.",

I ask another contractor privately and they tell me it’s essentially mandatory if you don’t wanna get canned.  They don’t cover gas or parking or time so this is going to add 5 hours to my commute and cost me north of $350 a month in parking.  Do I have any power here to push back or am I screwed.  I feel totally cheated since recruiting firm in my offer letter has the job as remote.\n\nupdate:\nspoke to the staffing firm, the offer letter they sent over has the position marked as remote.  The team claims they messed up but that the docusign they sent over after had it marked as hybrid so I need to come into the office two days a week and that they don't have room in the profit model to afford to comp parking.

There’s a weird idea floating around that these senior developers and tech leads are born with some genetic advancement that makes their brains better at coding. I highly doubt that. I think they’ve just had years of experience. \n\nSoftware development is learned over time, it’s not something you’re just born good at. If this were basketball, ok this guys born with genetics that make him 7 feet tall. If this were football, ok this kid was born to be 260 pounds at 16 years old. But software development? That’s like… just being exposed too and practicing a tech stack repeatedly.\n\nIf your new grad is failing or not getting hired, let’s exclude new grads who genuinely just don’t want to be software developers or can’t work in an environment without freaking out and punching someone. They’re not who I’m talking about. \n\nSince the bare minimum requirement to even have a seed to grow into a good developer is the ability to break down complex problems, patience, persistence, and willingness to learn, I think the vast majority of people can grow into good developers. But people need structure, exposure, and practice with a consistent stack before you make judgement calls on their overall lifetime ability to excel in technology.\n\nBasically, I’m babbling, but new grads who want to be software developers being incompetent isn’t the problem here. I think it’s more likely just market demand, lack of onboarding structure and documentation, unreasonable expectations for a new graduate skill level.",

I graduated in the fall semester of 2014 and have been working as a developer for 7 and a manager for the last 4 years.\n\nRecently I began applying for jobs as an engineering manager. I have to say it’s been though in our side as well. While the amount of call backs I get is very high the amount of jobs for this level are also very low. \n\nI have applied to a mixture of companies from Fortune 50, to Fortune 500 in all sectors from Fintech to healthcare.\n\nI have had maybe 32 conversations with recruiters. I have a very specific requirement. I do not want to manage an overseas team especially if I have to go the office 5 days a week to do it.\n\nOut of those 32 conversations only one company Capital One had me managing developers in the USA. Every single other company was in India EVERY single other company. Sometimes I would get a mix where there would be 2-8 US devs just doing high level architecture design then handing the work over.\n\nI thought about the Capital One job and I reached out to a contact at there and he told me pretty much the whole team was basically here on H1B visas including the other engineering managers. I’ve been around long enough to know how bad monoculture work environments are especially with H1B’s AND stack ranking so I declined that job as well.\n\nI have to be honest with you guys. I am going to need a job soon. I have been trying my best not to contribute to this outsourcing mess especially when it’s denying opportunities to people like me who came from bad social economic backgrounds and a no name school and was blessed to get a junior role where I could grow.\n\nI been reaching out to my network and it’s the same everywhere. Whole teams are getting replaced. I have friends that used to work normal hours waking up in the middle of the night to jump into sprint planning meetings. I got people crying and hugging their employees as their entire in office team is laid off then they have to drive into the office everyday just to hop on zoom calls with people in Argentina.\n\nIf we don’t get some legislative solutions for this I think our sector is going to go the way of manufacturing. You are going to be telling your kids about how you used to work a tech job right out of college for a good wage.",

We recently got a new developer on our team from a different team in the company, so he has little context/knowledge of our application or the data flow.\n\nHe was assigned a bug fix for a feature that I had implemented several months back so he's been coming to me for questions. The bug fix is a one line change. When he first picked up the ticket, he pinged me asking for some context/info. I provided him a detailed explanation of the flow and even pointed out how very similar bugs in the past have been fixed (the same solution as the one liner). I basically gave him everything he needed except for straight up telling him exactly what line to change. \n\nHe's been working on this ticket for 4 days now.\n\nAt what point do I step in and just tell him what to change? It feels like I would be kinda micromanaging him at that point but maybe I'm just looking at this wrong idk",

How has that changed (if at all) in the 2020 to current day post IPO? Is it still considered a Unicorn-ish company or is it on the same tier as FAANG now and lost that startup feel and hiring bar?",

For context, I have been job searching for half a year now, applied to over 600 full time roles, and landed one offer that’s not even related to data science and is located middle of nowhere.\n\nToday I heard one of my international friends got an internship offer from a faang level company, and I can’t stop feeling like shit about it. This friend always asked help from me in classes and somehow landed a way better internship than I did, even though I applied to over 400 last year and I’m not even international. Another one of my international friends landed Amazon swe. I can’t stop feeling like I am just not technically good enough, and I can’t stop wondering what is wrong with my application. I can’t help but to feel bitter when others land something better with way fewer applications. I have asked many people to look over my resume and they all say it’s good. People say it’s luck and a numbers game, but I have applied so much already and I can’t believe it’s only because im unlucky. I have had interviews from great companies, but I always somehow manage to screw it up and get rejected. I fully acknowledge the toxicity of my mindset and I would love to divert my energy to self improvement, but I have no idea how to stop feeling this way. If you have any encouraging words or advice, pls let me know.\n\n",

And with how fast AI and automation are evolving, it feels like the future is more fragile than most people admit.\n\nBecause of that, I’ve been thinking about how to start building real independence early:\n\n1.Side skills that could turn into freelance work.\n\n2. Small projects that could eventually generate income streams outside of employment.\n\n3. Financial strategies to lower dependence on a paycheck.\n\nI’m not planning to quit my job or anything crazy. Just want to start laying bricks while the sun is shining, instead of waiting for a storm.\n\nCurious:\n\n1. Has anyone here started building their \"Plan B\" while still working full-time?\n\n2.

The more I try to “prepare” myself by learning everything -  frameworks, design patterns, the best tools - the less I actually build.\nIt’s like I'm collecting knowledge badges but never cashing them in for experience.\n\nLast month, I went down the rabbit hole with three different JS frameworks. Spent hours reading docs, watching tutorials, bookmarking blogs I’ll probably never open again. I knew all the theory but had nothing to show for it.\n\nThen one random weekend, I said screw it and built a tiny little site around something dumb I cared about. It didn’t follow the “perfect stack” or latest trends, but I actually finished it. And I learned more from shipping that one thing than all the hours of passive studying.\n\nNow I’m trying to shift away from “learn first, build later” to “build first, learn while doing.”\n\nAnyways, back to my question. \nHave you ever felt the same way about learning topics that you curious about, almost to the point of obsession? Do you think that it is good or bad?",

It was never a large team to begin with, 5 developers plus my manager, managing ecommerce platforms, data, internal business applications, b2b systems, AI services, etc.\n\nLast year we lost one developer who was frustrated by the direction we were going. Her position was never filled, instead they hired a developer from India in an adjacent team, to focus on software for the warehouse. Then one developer was moved to a specific niche dealing with our internal Microsoft integrations. Now finally, another developer is being removed from my team. They carried a lot of weight because they were one of those \"say yes to everything\" work 16-hour day folks. However, now they are being completely removed from our area of the company and reassigned. I'm left with 1 other developer and he is very junior.\n\nIn 1 year, I've gone from a 5 person team to a 2 person team, and yet no expectations have been adjusted. I am being told that I should take on all the responsibilities of the developer that's now being moved, while maintaining my current responsibilities, compensating for the 2 developers that left last year who were never filled, and on top of all that with the company breathing down my neck wanting to start no less than 5 new major projects.\n\nAnd my manager is acting like everything is completely normal and seems to have no concept that this is completely impractical. I have asked for more staff for a year but it's falling on deaf ears, even when projects that were supposed to take 4 months ended up taking us close to a year. At the very least I have been asking for the opportunity to pair-program and work with some of the more senior developers that have left or are being reassigned, and yet the company cannot make time for that. There's always an excuse, some other \"more pressing issue\" that I have to focus on before training can happen.\n\nI feel like I'm being set up to fail and I have no idea how to plan for this. I am obviously looking for other jobs, but this is the worst market in a long time. I have some financial cushion, but I don't want to quit because of how the Economy is looking. That said, if I don't quit it feels like I will really quickly be backed into a corner where I am being asked to work insane hours to address even a portion of the responsibilities that are being laid on me or have to be constantly explaining why things are delayed and all blame put on my shoulders.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a 31M with about four years of software engineering experience. I spent my first year working as a consultant and have since been working as a fullstack engineer, with a heavy focus on backend engineering.\n\nCurrently, I'm at a large tech company — maybe a step or two below FAANG — but it's a name most people would recognize. Lately, though, I've been feeling stagnant. I'm still classified as an entry-level engineer in terms of pay and title, even though I'm consistently performing at a level or two above that. (That's not just my opinion — both my manager and two technical mentors have told me this.)\n\nFor example, as a Level 1 engineer, I'm technically supposed to be mostly taking tickets, relying on senior engineers for clarification, and developing technical depth in one main language. In reality, my day-to-day work involves starting and completing projects independently, defining requirements while working with outside stakeholders, implementing new technologies into our tools, and even managing a contractor. There’s a big gap between my responsibilities and my official title.\n\nSome extra context: since joining my current role, my company has gone through two rounds of layoffs, and my team has been moved under two different organizations (so I've had two different skip-level managers). Although no one has explicitly said it, I suspect that promotions are being slowed or avoided to cut costs, especially since the current job market makes it less likely that people will leave. Promotions *have* happened elsewhere in the company, but not on my team.\n\nThat said, if I didn't enjoy my job, I would just risk it and leave. But the truth is, I actually like it. My boss is supportive, my work-life balance is solid, and the benefits are good. The only real issue is that my career growth — specifically my title and pay — feels stuck. Technically, I'm still learning and working on interesting problems, so in that sense I’m not stagnant.\n\nI'm looking for advice on what to do next. Stay patient and hope things change? Look for a new opportunity elsewhere?  Thanks!",

        "author": "thefox13guy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've been a programmer professionally since the late 00s. I'm in Portland, which is just a mid-sized market, but still has plenty of tech jobs. I've worked at small startups as the first or second full time dev, some mid-sized companies, and FANG. I've been through a few acquisitions and survived many layoffs.\n\nWell, I was recently laid off for the first time from a mid-sized, B-tier tech company that I was having a great time at, so I am out there applying again. It was due to the typical offshoring trend and I was grateful to have survived a few rounds of layoffs and wasn't too worried. I've never had a hard time getting responses from local companies, and probably most of the time I would get interviews, and most interviews I would get an offer. But this time is different.\n\nI've applied for about two dozen companies (hybrid or onsite, haven't expanded to remote yet) and gotten almost no response. I think I am more than qualified for them and am perfectly fine with the compensation and all of that (ie, I wasn't just randomly blasting applications out there, I was picking things I genuinely wanted to do). 2-3 companies sent me a rejection based on my application, I've talked to 2-3 recruiters, and had one \"onsite\" interview. So let's just say I've gotten any response at all from about 25-30% of the companies I sent applications to. This is much lower than I'm used to.\n\nHere is the thing: I'm starting to wonder if having been at FANG and Big Tech (even though it was B-tier) most recently has hurt my chances. Just a few years ago I would've thought that having FANG would be a huge benefit for job hunting. And the 2-3 recruiters I've talked to seemed to like it, like it would make me a more marketable candidate.\n\nBut after the one onsite interview, I started to question that for the first time. I was prepared for a technical interview with maybe some behavioral, but the interviewer asked me quite a bit about FANG. I was surprised and got the feeling they thought negatively of it, like asking me about certain projects and responding with, \"So, you're saying you just wrote some Java?\" with a tone that they were downplaying what I did there.\n\nDon't get me wrong. Everything at FANG wasn't very impressive. The whole thing is mostly a joke (esp. the LeetCode interviews and corporate Kool Aid) and FANG tends to be a grindhouse for new grads who otherwise have no other experience, not a bunch of math geniuses writing crazy algorithms. But prior to that interview I didn't stop to think if I should mention it in my work history; it seemed obvious that I should. Now I'm starting to wonder all sorts of things like maybe companies are gonna think I'll ask for hundreds of thousands, that I only know how to do \"Big Tech non-sense\", or that I'll be a hard to work with.\n\nDo any hiring managers or ex-FANG have any thoughts on this? Seeing as how I am just looking for a local tech job where I can get work done and enjoy my time with the team, maybe I should just remove it from my work history?",

        "content": "Hi guys!\n\nBased on what I've seen on Reddit and other social media (LinkedIn, IG), today’s job market seems to favor specialists over generalists, and job hoppers are looked down upon.  \n  \nWith the job market being this rough, many people end up taking jobs they aren't necessarily passionate about (stepping stones) but they can't just immediately leave to not be flagged as a job hopper. *BTW, I'm thankful for having a job. I know it's tough out there.*  \n  \nHow can they make the most of these opportunities?\n\nFor example, what if the job uses a completely different tech stack than what you've worked with throughout your career, or even worse, historically the market don't want this tech stack, or if the role is different (i.e. transitioning from backend to frontend heavy fullstack), or you're not interested in the domain (i.e. insurance)?  \n  \nIf you plan to stay in this job for at least 3 years while waiting for the job market to improve (if it ever does), how can you make the most of the situation?\n\nIn my experience, becoming a domain expert and the goto person in a part of the system it's what makes you grow within an organization. However, becoming an expert requires time and effort, and both of these have an opportunity cost.\n\nSo knowing that time is finite and I can just study so much while keeping all my other adult responsibilities, should I focus on becoming an expert in this new tech stack and domain to take ownership and grow, in detriment of my original stack, knowing that my original stack is still evolving and requires ongoing study, and that I might never use this new stack again?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello. I'm a programmer in a tech startup that develops IoT devices for on-water activities as well as a companion app for them. Due to the nature of our usage case, we sometimes have to operate in bad network conditions: the internet bandwidth may be small, the link between smart trackers and user's phones may be unstable.. etc.. A binary protocol is such a good fit for this situation: saves the bandwidth, allows to have a unification between TCP and Bluetooth comms, works great on low-ram IoT devices. My first look went into Protobuf of course, as it slowly shapes like a new \"JSON of binary world\". But when I started digging deeper, I discovered that it has multiple big downsides and I can easily fix them if I make my own proto (spoiler: I made it).\n\n1. The generated code is HUGE (especially in Dart which is used for frontend).\n2. It doesn't support classes inheritance. Inheritance can be bad in some cases, but if inheriting a class with some common fields halves the codebase size, I do want to have that option.\n3. Some features like Enums are replaced by strange stuff like int consts (again, Dart code looks even worse)\n4. That whole stuff with optionals and fallback defaults isn't reliable: if it's a backwards compatible protocol, the fields have to be explicitly nullable without any fallback values.\n5. You can just make a bitfield for null values at the start of the message, and by doing so, you can get rid of the field headers (id + type) entirely: the id doesn't exist because fields are sequential, the type is known in schema. If receiver schema is old and transmitter has sent some unknown fields, these fields are always at the end of the message, so you can just skip these bytes.\n\nAnd so what I did is I actually wrote a protocol myself, and tested it for a while. Now, even though I still love it, my mind keeps thinking about the following problem: if and when the time comes to hire more people, how do I explain this tech stack to them? Protobuf is a well-known thing, we can just put it as a requirement and be okay. But what about in-house solution? Also, if we need to add another programming language the our system, the protocol has to be implemented by someone.\n\nNow I'm doubting if I should continue working with our in-house protocol, or switch to Protobuf.  \nMy questions are:\n\n1. Is an average developer ready to learn custom binary protocols?\n2. In other companies using binary protocols, how popular is it to write a custom one and how do employees feel about using it?\n3. Am I the only one to be unhappy with Protobuf and do I get something wrong about it?",

For us internships are mandatory. You cannot graduate without an internship. You cant even pass to the next year without a summer internship.\n\nInternships are part of your grade. The first year internship is called Initiation Internship or Observation Internship (at least one month). The second year internship is called Technical Internship (at least 2 months). And for the Final year, its a 6 month internship that start in January (half of the academic year is just the internship no classes), called PFE ( Projet Fin Etude), which translates to End of Education Project.\n\nYou supervisor has to give you like a grade on a form supplied by the school. At the start of the academic year. You have to present what you did at the internship in front of a panel of professors. And the the final one PFE internship project is a pretty big deal. You have to defend your work/project like a thesis in front of the panel. If you fuck up, you wont graduate.\n\nNow dont get me wrong our system is utter shit in many aspects. But at-least  you usually have a pretty solid CV showing real world experience.\n\nAnd I think this applies to all our schools not just Engineering.",

I currently work at a local Fortune 500 company's office making ~$85k/year, and have been here for almost a year. I've accepted an offer as an SDE-1 from one of the major tech giants for approximately double my current salary. The new offer is in the same city, so thankfully I don't have to handle moving logistics along with everything else here.\n\nI have received e-contracts that I've clicked \"sign\" on (not sure how binding these are?), and their background check is currently underway. I have *not* been introduced to my manager or gotten team match confirmation yet, but I've heard that this can often take until a week before your start date at this specific company. Technically the offer could still be rescinded, but I think that's fairly unlikely.\n\nMy start date at the new company is June 9th, and I have a pre-planned europe trip the last half of May. I'm trying to decide between three options:\n\n1. Resign now: Give my full two weeks' notice, finish cleanly, then enjoy my vacation and an additional week completely job-free before starting the new position.\n2. Resign after vacation: Return from my trip and immediately submit my resignation, giving slightly less than two weeks for documentation and handover. This approach would also eliminate any risk of the offer being rescinded while I'm already unemployed.\n3. Sandwich notice period with vacation: Resign one week before vacation, and offer to work one more week after I get back. This would give them a long time to decide what to do, and would hopefully let the background check clear before I give them notice of my departure. The downside is mostly that this would feel kind of weird to me, but maybe it's more normal than I think?\n\nWhat would be the most professional approach in this situation? Any insights from those who have navigated similar transitions would be greatly appreciated. This is the first time I've ever quit a job, so I'm a little lost and anxious here.",

Eventually, they found they were way over budget, they started to cut parts of the new platform little by little, and many got cut from the project and replaced with offshore even after they relocated. \n\nThe 2nd project, even after they interviewed me and told them directly that I was still rather junior level, they were expecting me to know almost everything and I had nobody on site on my team, and to get any help, I had to wait for them to be available between meetings where they had about 2 minutes to talk.  I repeated to them I never claimed to be a senior developer like they thought and eventually was released. \n\nThe 3rd project, I was on a team that had been recently split into two teams, and I asked why we needed so many people for only a couple services as it didn't seem like there'd be much to do, and they told me there was definitely going to be work to do.  After about 5 weeks, we had 2-3 people working on one user story that didn't take more than about an hour to do for one person.  My manager told me it was kind of slow, so I could use some of the time to watch Udemy videos and learn new tools while they waited for more stories to come.  Eventually, they disbanded the team because they found they didn't even need it and sent a few to other teams, and cut others including me.

        "content": "Before writing, I'm not looking for any \"just give up it's all cooked\" or \"just put the fries in the bag\" etc. I'm aware that the job market in general is not good and even more so if you're a weak candidate like me - the question I'm trying to explore is just what to do from here. I've been struggling with what to do for a couple years since I wasn't able to get an internship, but obviously it's now coming to a head. That being said, this is half-rant half-looking for advice so I'd appreciate constructive feedback.\n\nI'm an upcoming new grad, but (aside from a capstone project with a startup and teaching web design), I don't have a ton of marketable SWE skills other than the fundamentals. I was not able to secure a proper internship during my school career, so my only real experience is with the startup, where I mostly helped design the database, user design, and implement some AI functionality.\n\nI picked computer science because I felt it was a good balance of security and things that I like. That being, I like tech and problem solving. I was never particularly passionate about software engineering in particular, but I do love debugging and building upon existing projects. But as I approach graduation in a few weeks and hundreds of applications (and some referrals) are now returning rejections, I'm not really sure where to do. And I have already been applying to anything vaguely tech related across the US, but not getting any callbacks, which I'm sure is an indication of my resume strength.\n\nI'm feeling lost like I'm sure a lot of other people are. I feel like I'm just losing out to the people who are far more experienced and passionate than me. The response to that would be to work on personal projects and hone my portfolio, but I'm honestly skeptical that would even work. Granted, I haven't put a ton of time into doing so yet as I've been focusing on school and work, so I don't actually know yet, but I see all these super experienced and talented people getting turned down all the time anyways so it's a bit defeating.\n\n**TL;DR:** My dilemma is this - I don't know if the best plan of action is just to bunker down and grind out personal projects while continuing to apply everywhere, or instead try to study a related field to try and break in there, which would be basically any role that appreciates a CS degree. Whether that's QA, tech support/IT, data analysis, etc., I think any of them could be engaging work for me still, but I think I would still need to specifically study one of them to get in.\n\nIf anyone is interested - [here's my anonymous resume](https://imgur.com/a/AZqRh80). If anyone has any tips for improving it, that would be appreciated as well. Thanks all.",

Job market was rough for international students, and big tech wasn’t hiring, but I was fortunate enough to get a return offer from my internship at a mid-sized company. I was doing ML research and modelling work in a lab before my job but I’m now working in the ML Platform/MLOps team.\n\nWork involves building big data platforms, data drift monitoring, IAC, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, model deployment, Docker, load balancers, async programming, and building semantic search engines.\nStack: Python, PySpark, AWS, Databricks, Docker, Pulumi, asyncio.\n\nFully remote, good WLB, $118k base + $50k~$60k RSUs over 4 years with a bulk of it vested towards the end. Grateful to have something stable in this economy. But the compensation doesn’t increase much in the long run in my company compared to big tech and its always been my dream to work at a big tech like google.\n\nA few questions:\n1. ML work here in my company is mostly calling LLM APIs which I find boring. One of the main reasons why I switched to MLOps. If you are an MLE at a big tech how does your work look like? If I pivot, I’d want to focus on Information Retrieval/RecSys.\n2. I enjoy the engineering side more. Should I stay in ML Platform roles or move toward more traditional MLE roles?\n3. How’s ML Platform Engineering for long-term career growth? \n4. Should I stay a year more and try for SDE 2 equivalent roles at FAANG/big tech? ( I will have 3  YoE by next march including my internships and work experience before masters). Hearing bad things about Meta/Amazon WLB and layoffs. How is the scene at other big tech companies?\n\nWould appreciate any advice! Thank you!\n",

I didn't choose to be in COBOL; that's what they trained and assigned me to and I didn't have anywhere else to go to at that time. I could have left and tried to go for a more useful tech stack after 2 years but the pandemic happened so looking for a new job was impossible. When the pandemic ended, I eventually got to move to a different company and do Java development instead.\n\nMy problem is, I only have 2+ years of professional experience with Java. I've been working for way longer than that but I'm treated more like a mid level developer because my only experience in Java is that long and nobody seems to care about my 4 years of experience in COBOL because to be quite honest, it's a really outdated language. I'm unable to break into the senior developer level in my company because I need more years of experience with Java.\n\nTo make things worse, I have zero work experience in frameworks, APIs, microservices, cloud development, etc. The Java project I worked on didn't have those, or at least didn't have me do work in those. I never got to work on CI/CD or databases because that's not the task I got assigned to. I got to do side tasks like automation with Excel VBA macros but that doesn't seem to be as helpful for my resume as it sounds.\n\nMeanwhile, I see others younger than me get to be 5 years of experience, have experience with things like AWS, microservices, frameworks, RedHat, containers, etc.\n\nDid they just get lucky in their projects and I got unlucky? How do I even ask my manager to put me in a project that allows me to gain experience with cloud development, microservices, frameworks, and all that trendy stuff? There is an opportunity in my company that wants COBOL developers and maybe I could make it as a senior COBOL developer but I fear that it's only going to exacerbate my current issue. How does one even navigate this? I feel like I have to choose between catching up in experience as a Java developer or being a senior COBOL developer in a rapidly declining language.",

So I didn't get to develop any actual skills during my 2.5 years there, and was laid off in June 2024.\n\nI've had three actual interviews since then, got to the final round for data engineer at Citi but blew it at the end, and couldn't give satisfactory answers to interview technical concepts for a similar position at Royal Carribean (the interviewers were looking at each other and laughing about my apparent ineptitude, it was humiliating), and some other non-technical position that also went nowhere. Hundreds of applications and rejections later, I'm at wit's end.\n\nI've been studying for AWS certs and learning AWS basics, I scheduled the basic Cloud Practitioner exam, since I may as well start from scratch. Should I continue down this path? Seek help from an alumni network from my alma mater, Rutgers New Brunswick? Meaninglessly applying to jobs hasn't worked obviously since I have no connections to use, and every LinkedIn recruiter I try to contact just blows me off and says to apply online and wait, etc. Or should I just try to pursue a Master's in Data Science?

        "author": "Dp1819",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi all,\n\nNot sure if this type of post has been shared before especially since I'm no longer a student, but I’m really in need of some guidance, so I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this. I’m at a crossroads and trying to figure out: **What should I do next, and where do I go from here?** I’m not looking for an easy way out, just trying to figure out a realistic path forward to build a career.\n\nWhat I have been doing hasn't been working, and I know I need to change something. That’s why I’m here: to get feedback, suggestions, and maybe some perspective.\n\nI’ve broken this down into a few parts to make it easier to follow.\n\n* My Background\n* Why I Chose CS\n* The Big Question\n* **TL;DR**\n\n**My Background**  \nI graduated in May 2023 with a BS in Computer Science. Looking back, I wish I had taken my degree more seriously instead of coasting through it. Now I’m dealing with a lot of imposter syndrome that makes learning new things and interviewing feel even tougher. Hindsight really is 20/20.\n\nDuring undergrad, I didn’t land any internships—largely due to my own lack of confidence and not being proactive enough. After graduation, I spent a little over a year job hunting. During this time I tried to upskill and completed some certifications and got an informal internship/volunteer opportunity through networking, where I gained some experience in front-end work and databases.\n\nI then landed my first role as a Junior AI Engineer in August. In that role, I helped build out a few internal use cases for clients and worked with a hedge fund to analyze their GenAI platform and prioritize dev goals for 2025. Unfortunately, I was let go recently due to the company shutting down its AI practice.\n\nStill, I don't consider myself a strong candidate by any means, and the job market + the time that has passed since graduating definitely isn't in my favor. Despite sending out countless applications, I rarely hear back.\n\n**So Why Did I Pick CS?**  \nI picked CS because I saw long-term potential, not just financially, but also in terms of growth and problem-solving. I genuinely enjoyed the logic and creativity involved in coding. In college, I actually liked debugging and edge-case testing the code I created more than I expected.\n\nBut lately, that passion feels like it’s slipping away. It’s hard to stay motivated when things feel like they’re falling apart. It’s disheartening, and honestly, it’s making me question whether the last four years were a waste.\n\n**The Big Question at Hand**  \nRight now, I feel incredibly lost, probably like many others. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m falling behind, especially when I compare myself to peers who graduated around the same time.\n\nThe standard advice is to build personal projects and improve my portfolio. I get that, but I’m skeptical it’ll be enough, especially with how competitive the market is and how slow progress feels. Plus, with family constantly pressuring me about past career mistakes, it’s hard to stay focused without a clearer payoff or timeline.\n\nSo I’ve been thinking about my options:\n\n* **MSCS:** A way to “reset” and fill in the gaps from undergrad. It could help with imposter syndrome and open internship opportunities I didn’t get before/cant get right now. Given my very average undergrad GPA, I know I’d likely need to take the GRE to be more competitive, which I’m fine with. I’d aim to start in the **spring semester** to avoid the heavier fall admission competition and get started sooner.\n* **MS in a related field (e.g., another branch of engineering):** Broaden my skillset, explore new roles, and diversify my job prospects. Same as above, I’d plan to take the GRE and target a **spring start** to accelerate the transition and improve my odds.\n* **Full career pivot (e.g., new engineering undergrad):** A drastic change, and I know it would mean starting over and potentially wasting more years, but being stuck in limbo with no job security is taking a toll on me.\n* **Stick with CS and keep grinding**: Keep applying while building out a solid portfolio with personal projects and maybe open source contributions. It’s the most “practical” option, but also the slowest and hardest to stay motivated in without signs of progress.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nGraduated in May 2023 with a BS in CS. Spent little over a year job hunting (not trying to spend this long again) before landing a Junior AI Engineer role that lasted 8 months before being laid off. Now I feel like I’m back to square one. Trying to figure out if I should:\n\n* Double down and pursue an **MSCS**: A way to “reset” and fill in the gaps from undergrad & open internship opportunities (targeting spring start + potential GRE to boost my app),\n* Pivot to a **related engineering master’s:** Broaden my skillset, explore new roles, and diversify my job prospects,\n* Do a **full career change** with another undergrad degree, or\n* **Stick with CS**, build out personal projects, and keep applying indefinitely.\n\nFeeling burnt out and unsure what’s worth pursuing anymore. Would genuinely appreciate any honest constructive advice or perspective.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n(if you think there's a better sub for this question, let me know)",

I took a little under a year off to reset mentally because the COVID era of school seriously took a part of me with it and I needed to catch my breath before I imploded. Since then I have applied to any/everything with no hope in sight. I did one year of some bs AI Training gig that made me a bit of money, dried up, and hasn't helped land me any opportunities. \n\nWatching my friends that I graduated with all succeed is only making the dread and self-hatred worse. It feels like I gave up the last spot on a ride that closed before I was mentally prepared to get on board. \n\nBeing this far removed from school I'm not a walking algorithm library anymore and would be a deer in headlights in any technical interview. I've been taking online courses on several things like REACT, .NET fullstack, and databases, to learn useful skills but still feels so helpless since I don't have the time to grind leetcode like I used to. It's all so frustrating because I know how to program, I'm a good learner, and some part of me still wants this career so badly. But, I'm 25 now and hate how unworthy I feel solely because I'm a real person with struggles that got the best of me. \n\nAnyways, I don't know what kind of advice I'm expecting, unloading this was more of a therapeutic release because I feel ashamed when I talk about this with my friends. I just need something to help me wake up and stop feeling like I failed myself.",

It's an AWS Infrastructure automation pipeline using Jenkins, Terraform and Ansible. Please look at it from the lens of a recruiter/hiring manager and tell me if this is eye catching enough or if I should do something more complex or useful.\n\n* Terraform - Starts the EC2 instance using a launch template and auto-scaling group with all necessary attributes attached (Security groups, key-value pair, etc).\n* Ansible - Logs into the EC2 instance, downloads services and copies necessary HTML and CSS files from my portfolio website into /var/www/html, making it visible from the browser.\n* Jenkins - Has two pipelines.\n   * 'Create' pipeline\n      * Runs the terraform part to start the EC2 instance, retrieves IP of the new instance using the aws-describe command, and adds it to hosts file for ansible to use it. Then, runs the ansible part to get the website live.\n      * Triggered by a git push\n   * 'Destroy' pipeline\n      * Runs terraform destroy to take down the infrastructure safely.\n      * This is invoked by the 'create' pipeline and runs 15 minutes after it.\n\nI did learn a lot about all these tools, credential security and management, automation, etc. Before y'all come at me, I know that some of my choices might seem weird, like - using Jenkins instead of Github Actions, or using Ansible when the entire thing can be taken care of by a user\\_data script, or hosting it on AWS when I can just have it on my .github.io page.  \nI used the tools and technologies because I wanted to learn these tools specifically, as they seem to be more prevalent in job descriptions.  I'm open to honest feedback and would love to improve. I love automation and I love building things, so I can do this all over again without an issue.\n\nThank you!",

But nothing in tech lasts forever. \n\nWould getting an online CS masters degree help my career at this point? Or should I just upskill and build projects instead? I’m tired of being a full stack generalist, and I know the demand for that is decreasing. ",

        "content": "Sorry for the clickbait title.\n\nI'm interested in the Georgia Tech Online Master's in CS, but enrollment doesn’t open until Spring 2026. My background in CS is pretty limited: mainly Excel, a MATLAB course, and a Numerical Methods course from my time as a aerospace engineering student. I also worked for two years doing analysis and data reduction using MATLAB.\n\nI'd like to prepare ahead of time to strengthen my application and be more ready for the coursework once the program starts.\n\nI'm considering taking an intro to CS course, either through WGU or my local community college. Both are online, but I can start the WGU course about two months earlier. The price difference is minimal, around $50.\n\nSecond, how much CS knowledge is typically expected going into a Master’s in CS?\n\n\nI would like to go into the drone industry where Machine Learning is being used a lot right now.

        "content": "I’m currently working as a junior dev in a fully remote role in the US, with around 1.5 years experience. Yesterday my manager told me that they are going to start requiring us to come onsite for a week every other month. And even though it’s fully paid for and they are supposedly paying for my transportation and stuff, I want to be mentally prepared in case this  turns into full onsite mandate. \n\nAs inconvenient as it would be, I would be able to come to terms with RTO as long as I made enough to reasonably live & save on my own, and if the place that I am relocating to is reasonably populated with some scope of finding a new job if I get laid off. Unfortunately, neither box is checked in my case. I don’t make enough to live and save on my own (I’m only afloat right now because my parents let me live with them and my role is fully remote), and the city that I would be relocating to is tiny and in the middle of nowhere. Tbh I only took this job because the market is really bad for juniors and I desperately need some experience to jumpstart my career. \n\nMy biggest fears are that if I had to relocate in the future, I would not be able to save and just be living paycheck to paycheck. And the town that I would be living in is tiny and has little facilities, and not close to any larger cities. If I got laid off, there is almost zero scope for other tech opportunities in the area (I’ve checked), and I would have to move away again. It’s also nowhere near my parents or anyone I know, so I don’t have a safety net or people in a reasonable driving distance if things go awry. Almost no socialization opportunities either. \n\nBut obviously, I need experience and the market is still bad for juniors right now, so leaving means I might stagnate and struggle to find a new role.  \n\nWhat would you do if you were in my shoes? Or if you’ve faced something similar, any tips?",

However, I have my eye on a big position and I'm looking forward to climbing the ladder. What I'm wondering now is if I should get a master's while working so that I can climb it even faster. I'm European so the cost isn't a problem however I'd like to know if it's worth it. I have either a CS master or an MBA in mind.\n\nHas anyone had experience with companies highly favoring master's degree owners? Or would it not be worth my time and effort?",
