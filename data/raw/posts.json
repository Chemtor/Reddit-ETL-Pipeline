        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering  👋\n\nI’ve spent most of my career working with databases, and one thing that’s always bugged me is how hard it is for AI agents to work with them. Whenever I ask Claude or GPT about my data, it either invents schemas or hallucinates details. To fix that, I built [ToolFront](https://docs.toolfront.ai/). It's a free and open-source Python library for creating lightweight but powerful retrieval agents, giving them a safe, smart way to actually understand and query your database schemas.\n\n# So, how does it work?\n\nToolFront equips your agents with 2 read-only database tools that help them explore your data and quickly find answers to your questions. You can either use the built-in MCP server, or create your own custom retrieval tools.\n\n# Connects to everything\n\n* 15+ databases and warehouses, including: Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL & more!\n* Data files like CSVs, Parquets, JSONs, and even Excel files.\n* Any API with an OpenAPI/Swagger spec (e.g. GitHub, Stripe, Discord, and even internal APIs)\n\n# Why you'll love it\n\n* **Zero configuration:** Skip config files and infrastructure setup. ToolFront works out of the box with all your data and models.\n* **Predictable results**: Data is messy. ToolFront returns structured, type-safe responses that match exactly what you want e.g.\n   * `answer: list[int] = db.ask(...)`\n* **Use it anywhere**: Avoid migrations. Run ToolFront directly, as an MCP server, or build custom tools for your favorite AI framework.\n\nIf you’re building AI agents for databases (or APIs!), I really think ToolFront could make your life easier. Your feedback last time was incredibly helpful for improving the project. Please keep it coming!\n\n**Docs:** [https://docs.toolfront.ai/](https://docs.toolfront.ai/)\n\n**GitHub Repo**: [https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)\n\nA ⭐ on GitHub really helps with visibility!",

With open source, we’d likely have to combine multiple tools to reach a similar level of functionality. On the plus side, that would give us:\n\n⁠- flexible server scaling based on demand\n- potentially lower costs\n- more flexibility in how we handle different workloads\n\nOn the other hand, Fabric provides a more integrated ecosystem, less overhead in managing different tools, and tight integration with the Microsoft stack.\n\n\n\nAny insights would be super helpful as we’re evaluating the best long-term direction. :)",

I do see analyst jobs with better salaries that want a lot of ML or DE experience. If I stay at my current job, the next jobs up the ladder are less technical roles. They are more like management/project management type roles. Who knows when those positions will ever open up. \n\nI feel like the next step might be to specialize in DE but that will require a lot of self learning on my part.

        "author": "Key_Salamander234",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\n\n\nSo I've been diving into AI for the past few months (this is actually my first real project) and got a bit frustrated with how \"dumb\" LLMs can be when it comes to navigating complex SQL databases. Standard text-to-SQL is cool, but it often misses the business context buried in weirdly named columns or implicit relationships.\n\n\n\nMy idea was to build a semantic layer on top of a SQL database (PostgreSQL in my case) using a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j. The goal is to give an LLM a \"map\" of the database it can actually understand.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's the core concept:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nInstead of just tables and columns, the Python framework builds a graph with rich nodes and relationships:\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Node Types:\\*\\* We have \\`Database\\`, \\`Schema\\`, \\`Table\\`, and \\`Column\\` nodes. Pretty standard stuff.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Properties are Key:\\*\\* This is where it gets interesting. Each \\`Column\\` node isn't just a name. I use GPT-4 to synthesize properties like:\n\n\\*   \\`business\\_description\\`: \"Stores the final approval date for a sales order.\"\n\n\\*   \\`stereotype\\`: \\`TIMESTAMP\\`, \\`PRIMARY\\_KEY\\`, \\`STATUS\\_FLAG\\`, etc.\n\n\\*   \\`confidence\\_score\\`: How sure the LLM is about its analysis.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Rich Relationships:\\*\\* This is the core of the semantic layer. The graph doesn't just have \\`HAS\\_COLUMN\\` relationships. It also creates:\n\n\\*   \\`EXPLICIT\\_FK\\_TO\\`: For actual foreign keys, a direct, machine-readable link.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*\\`IMPLICIT\\_RELATION\\_TO\\`\\*\\*: This is the fun part. It finds columns that are logically related but have no FK constraint. For example, it can figure out that \\`users.email\\_address\\` is semantically equivalent to \\`employees.contact\\_email\\`. It does this by embedding the descriptions and doing a vector similarity search in Neo4j to find candidates, then uses the LLM to verify.\n\n\n\nThe final KG is basically a \"human-readable\" version of the database schema that an LLM agent could query to understand context before trying to write a complex SQL query. For instance, before joining tables, the agent could ask the graph: \"What columns are semantically related to \\`customer\\_id\\`?\"\n\n\n\nSince I'm new to this, my main question for you all is: \\*\\*is this actually a useful approach in the real world?\\*\\* Does something like this already exist and I just reinvented the wheel?\n\n\n\nI'm trying to figure out if this idea has legs or if I'm over-engineering a problem that's already been solved. Any feedback or harsh truths would be super helpful.\n\n\n\nThanks!",

Would love to hear how others are structuring their DAGs in production.\n\n  \nThanks!",

        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering,\n\nLike many of you, I've spent a good chunk of my career being the go-to person for ad-hoc data requests. The constant context-switching to answer simple questions for marketing, sales, or product folks was a huge drain on my productivity.\n\nSo, I started working on a side project to see if I could build a better way. The result is something I'm calling DBdash.\n\nThe idea is simple: it’s a tool that lets you (or your less-technical stakeholders) ask questions in plain English, and it returns a verified answer, a chart, and just as importantly, the exact SQL query it ran.\n\nMy biggest priority was building something that engineers could actually trust. There are no black boxes here. You can audit the SQL for every single query to confirm the logic. The goal isn't to replace analysts or engineers, but to handle that first layer of simple, repetitive questions and free us up for more complex work.\n\nIt connects directly to your database (Postgres and MySQL supported for now) and is designed to be set up in a few minutes. Your data stays in your warehouse.\n\nI'm getting close to a wider launch and would love to get some honest, direct feedback from the pros in this community.\n\n\\*   Does this seem like a tool that would actually solve a problem for you?  \n\\*   What are the immediate red flags or potential security concerns that come to mind?  \n\\*   What features would be an absolute must-have for you to consider trying it?\n\nYou can check out the landing page here: [https://dbdash.app](https://dbdash.app)\n\nIt's still in early access, but I'm really keen to hear what this community thinks. I'm ready for the roast!\n\nThanks for your time.",

I do not want a solution that is very bespoke, I would prefer a well-established and used DB engine.\n\nWhat database would you recommend?

The challenge is that I don’t have a university degree or any formal training in the field. Everything I know, I learned through hands-on experience and self-study. I’m solely responsible for the BI area at my company (with basic support from an assistant), and the company has an annual revenue of around R$1.2 billion.\n\nRecently, I developed a full Power BI solution from scratch — handling everything from data extraction and organization to visualization — to monitor the entire operation of our distribution center, which I’ll be presenting next week. I have basic knowledge of SQL and Python, and I’m particularly interested in the technical and organizational aspects of working with data.\n\nMy current role is Junior Analyst, but I’ll be evaluated for a promotion to Mid-level in October. I started in this field just over two years ago, from absolute zero, as an assistant. About a year ago, the specialist in our department resigned, and even though I was still an assistant, I stepped up to take on the role. It was very challenging at first, but over time I managed to handle the workload and deliver results. According to my manager, I’m expected to be promoted to Specialist by October 2026. Even without a formal degree, I’ve been able to solve the challenges that come my way.\n\nI’m 27 years old now, and I sometimes feel a bit late to start college. That’s why I’d like to hear your advice on the best path to land a Data Engineering position abroad. I’m not a native English speaker, but I’ve been studying and improving my skills, and I feel comfortable with the language. Thank you very much for your time and guidance.",

The challenge is that my analytical, direct approach is what made me good at the technical work, but it's not translating well to the business side.\n\nI've tried some of the usual suspects (Toastmasters, generic communication courses) but they all feel like they're designed for sales people or public speakers, not engineers. The advice is either shallow (e.g. pace, filler words) or in theory (e.g. DISC framework) which doesn't really help when your brain is wired to solve problems efficiently.\n\n**For those who've successfully made this transition - what actually moved the needle for you?** Looking for practical advice, not just \"practice more.\"\n\nAlso, I'm working on something specifically for technical professionals facing this challenge.

        "title": "The Anatomy of a S3-Native Distributed Query Engine",
        "author": "heisenberg_zzh",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering,\n\nI'm the co-founder of Databend, an open source Snowflake alternative, and I wanted to share a bit of our journey building a SQL query engine that's designed to live on cloud storage like S3. This isn't a sales pitch—just an honest, educational walkthrough of the \"why\" behind our architecture. If you've ever been curious about what happens inside a query engine or why your queries on data lakes sometimes feel slow, I hope this sheds some light.\n\n**The Dream: A Database on S3**\n\nLike many of you, we love S3. It's cheap, it's huge, and it's durable. The dream is to just point a SQL engine at it and go, without managing a complex, traditional data warehouse. But there's a catch: S3 is a network service, and the network is *slow*.\n\nA single data request to S3 might take 50-200 milliseconds. In that tiny slice of time, your CPU could have executed millions of instructions. If your query engine just sits there and waits for the data to arrive, you're essentially paying for expensive CPUs to do nothing. This latency is the single biggest monster you have to slay when building a database on S3.\n\n**Why We Built a New Query Executor**\n\nWhen we started, we naturally looked at classic database designs. They're brilliant pieces of engineering, but they were born in a world of fast, local disks.\n\n1. **The \"Pull\" Model (aka the \"Volcano\" model):** Think of this like a game of telephone. The final step of your query plan (e.g., `SUM()`) asks the step before it for a row, which asks the step before it, and so on, all the way down to the data source. It's simple and has a nice, natural flow. **But on S3, it's a performance disaster.** When the first operator in the chain asks S3 for data, the *entire assembly line* of operators grinds to a halt. Your CPUs are idle, just waiting for data to arrive, while you're burning money on compute you can't use.\n2. **The \"Push\" Model (Vectorized Execution):** This is more like a factory assembly line. The data source pushes batches of data to the first worker, which processes it and pushes it to the next. It's fantastic for raw CPU performance. **But on S3, it's a memory bomb.** S3 can send data in unpredictable bursts. A fast data-scanning step can easily flood a slower step (like a complex `JOIN`), causing data to pile up in memory until the system crashes.\n\n**From SQL to an Execution Plan**\n\nSo, how does a simple SQL string like `SELECT * FROM ...` turn into a plan that our workers can run? It's a multi-stage process, a bit like a chef turning a recipe into a detailed kitchen workflow.\n\n1. **Parsing:** First, we parse the raw SQL text into a structured format called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This is just a tree that represents the query's grammar, making it understandable for the machine.\n2. **Logical Plan:** Next, we convert the AST into a *logical plan*. This describes the *what* of the query—the sequence of high-level operations needed, like \"scan this table,\" then \"filter these rows,\" then \"aggregate the results.\" It's still abstract and doesn't care about how the data is stored or how many machines we have.\n3. **Physical Plan:** This is where the magic happens. Our query optimizer takes the logical plan and transforms it into a *physical plan*. It looks at table statistics, data layout, and available resources to decide the most efficient *how*. For example, it decides whether to use a Hash Join or a Merge Join, how to distribute work across nodes, and in what order to join tables.\n4. **Executor Graph:** Finally, this physical plan is used to generate the actual graph of `Processor` actors that our scheduler will run. Each step in the physical plan becomes one or more workers in our asynchronous assembly line.\n\nThis whole process ensures that by the time we start executing, we have a cost-optimized, concrete plan ready to go.\n\n**A New Plan: Building for the Cloud**\n\nThe core idea was simple: **a worker should never block waiting for the network.** While it's waiting for S3, it should be able to do other useful work. This is the principle of asynchronous processing.\n\nWe designed a system in Rust based on a few key concepts:\n\n* **Workers as Independent \"Actors\":** Each part of the query plan—a `Filter`, `Join`, `Aggregate`—is an independent worker. Think of it as a specialist on an assembly line with a simple job and its own state.\n* **A Central \"Scheduler\" as the Factory Manager:** Instead of talking to each other, workers report their status to a central scheduler. A worker can raise its hand and say:\n   * \"I'm ready for data!\"\n   * \"I have a batch of data and I'm ready to do some computation.\"\n   * \"I'm about to ask S3 for data, which will take a while. You can check back on me later.\"\n   * \"Whoa, I'm getting overwhelmed! My output buffer is full! Tell the upstream workers to pause.\"\n* **Backpressure as the Safety Valve:** That last status is crucial. It's called **backpressure**, and it's the system's safety valve. It prevents the memory bomb. If a `JOIN` worker gets overwhelmed, it tells the scheduler, which then tells the `Scan` worker to stop fetching data from S3 for a moment. This allows the system to self-regulate and remain stable.\n* **IO Concurrency is Key to Hiding Latency:** Because asking for data is non-blocking, we can ask S3 for hundreds of different data chunks *all at once*. The scheduler then efficiently processes them as they arrive. This allows us to saturate the network connection and hide the latency of any single request, dramatically improving throughput.\n\n**How This Scales to Handle Complex SQL**\n\nThis architecture allows us to scale in two ways:\n\n1. **Multi-threading (Scaling Up):** For a single, large query, we can duplicate parts of the query pipeline. For example, we can have multiple `Scan` and `Partial Aggregate` workers running in parallel on different CPU cores, each processing a different part of the data. A final `Merge` step combines their results.\n2. **Distributed Execution (Scaling Out):** To scale across multiple machines, we treat the network as just another connection between workers. A special `Exchange` worker on one machine can send data to another `Exchange` worker on a different machine. To the rest of the query plan, it's completely transparent. This lets us use the same logic for a single-node query and a 100-node distributed query.\n\n**A Few Hard-Won Lessons**\n\n* **Stability over raw speed:** Building in robust backpressure from day one was the single most important decision for system stability.\n* **Separate your concerns:** We run I/O-heavy tasks (like waiting for the network) and CPU-heavy tasks (like decompressing data) on separate thread pools. This ensures that a long computation doesn't stop the engine from handling new data arriving from S3.\n* **Observability is everything:** When you have thousands of tiny tasks running in parallel, you need great tooling to see what's going on, like query profiles, flamegraphs, and distributed tracing logs to find where the bottlenecks are and why a query is slow.\n\nI hope this was a helpful, non-hyped look into what it takes to build a modern, cloud-native query engine. The concepts of asynchronous processing and backpressure are becoming more and more relevant for all kinds of data systems, not just databases.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions about our architecture or the trade-offs we made!

        "content": "Let's assume we have a set of interdependent data models. As of today, we offer the analysts at our company to specify the schedule at which their data models should run. So if a data model and its upstream table (tables on which the data model is dependent) is scheduled to run at the same time or the upstream table is scheduled to run before a data model, there is no problem (in case the schedule is the same, the upstream table runs first).\n\n  \nIn the above case, \n\n1. The responsibility of making sure that the models run in the correct order falls on the analysts (i.e. they need to specify the schedule of the data models and the corresponding upstream tables correctly).\n\n2. If they specify an incorrect order (i.e. the upstream table's scheduled time is after the corresponding data model), the data model will be refreshed followed by the refresh of the upstream table at the specified schedule.\n\nI want to validate if this system is fine or should we make any changes to the system. I have the following thoughts: -\n\n1. We can specify the schedule for a data model and when a data model is scheduled to run, run the corresponding upstream tables first and then run the data model. This would mean that scheduling will only be done for the leaf data models. This in my opinion sounds a bit complicated and lacks flexibility (What if a non-leaf data model needs to be refreshed at a particular time due to a business use case?).\n\n2. We can let the analysts still specify the schedules for the tables but validate whether the schedule of all the data models is correct (e.g., within a day, the upstream tables' scheduled refresh time(s) should be before that of the data model).\n\nI would love to know how you guys approach scheduling of data models in your organizations. As an added question, it would be great to know how you orchestrate the execution of the data models at the specified schedule. Right now, we use Airflow to do that (we bring up an Airflow DAG every half an hour which checks whether there are any data models to be run in the next half an hour and run them).\n\n  \nThank you for reading.",

What tools should I use?\nI know it's a big task for a junior BUT I want to do it as best as possible.\n\nThank you. ",

And it has been 1y I have been promoted as data platform technical lead on a managed data platform dedicated mainly to industry and oil and gas. I like the role since I get to design, architect and build data products that are really bringing value to the business. I learnt that our company are signing a big contract with this data platform technology. This means more opportunity will be available for me inside the company. And I might transition to other projects after that the current project passes to the run phase. It is honestly exciting however I’m afraid to get locked to this technologie that it is again very niche and technologically speaking less sophisticated than other data platforms like Databricks. It does not yet incorporate lakehouse philosophie/ tools/ data formats for example. The one I’m working on it is more or less a managed spark cluster with many managed niche industry data source connectors.\nAlso, we are early adopters of this data platform but it has been showing a consistent growth signs, for example Aramco is investing on them and is starting to be used by big oil and gas actors.\n\nI want to get your opinion on this situation, and whether you encountered a similar one and what did you do? do you think it’s a good thing to continue working and growing inside my company around this niche data platform or should I get more closer to databricks projects (my company is a big one and some projects are using databricks but much smaller projects with less impact )\n\nThank you!\n\n\n",

        "content": "I've been looking for Data Integration Engineer jobs in the healthcare space lately, and that motivated me to build my own, rudimentary data ingestion engine based on how I think tools like Mirth, Rhapsody, or Boomi would work. I wanted to share it here to get feedback, especially from any data engineers working in the healthcare, public health, or healthtech space.\n\nThe gist of the project is that it's a Dockerized pipeline that produces synthetic HL7 messages and then passes the data through a series of steps including ingestion, quality assurance checks, and conversion to FHIR. Everything is monitored and tracked with Prometheus and displayed with Grafana. Kafka is used as the message queue, and MinIO is used to replicate an S3 bucket.\n\nIf you're the type of person that likes digging around in code, you can check the project out [here](https://github.com/bryanbritten/hl7-integration).\n\nIf you're the type of person that would rather watch a video overview, you can check that out [here](https://www.loom.com/share/3de54014865b4cb7aa59b87ec940626d?sid=271f23fd-7ade-4f82-864f-e2a288a96a36).\n\nI'd love to get feedback on what I'm getting right and what I could include to better represent my capacity for working as a Data Integration Engineer in healthcare. I am already planning to extend the segments and message types that are generated, and will be adding a terminology server (another Docker service) to facilitate working with LOINC, SNOMED, and IDC-10 values.\n\nThanks in advance for checking my project out!",

Since I want it to follow industry standards but don't know how these systems *really work* in \"real life\", I'm here asking: can I write customer orders directly into the pipeline for analytics? Or the OLTP part of the system needs it? If yes, for what purpose(s)?\n\nThe same question obviously can't be made for customer and product related data, since those represent the current state of the application and are needed for it to function properly. They will, of course, end up in the warehouse (maybe as SCDs), but the most recent version must live primarly in production.\n\nSo, in short, I want to know how data that is considered *fact* in dimensional modeling is handled in traditional relational modeling. For an e-commerce, orders can represent state if we want to implement some features like delivery tracking, refund possibility etc, but for the sake of simplicity I'm talking about totally closed, immutable facts.",

You can also search a pokemon to see the most used build for it. If it is not found in the current months meta report, it will default to the most recent month where it is found (E.g Charizard wasnt in the data set for August, but would show in July).\n\nThis is my first project where I tried to an create and implement ETL pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load) into a useable dashboard for myself and anyone else that is interested. I've also uploaded the project to github if anyone is interested in taking a look. I have set an automation timer to pull the dataset for each month on the 3rd of the month - hoping it works for September!\n\nPlease take a look and let me know of any feedback, hope this helps some new or experienced VGC players :)\n\n[https://vgcpokemonstats.streamlit.app/](https://vgcpokemonstats.streamlit.app/)  \n[https://github.com/luxyoga/vgcpokemonstats](https://github.com/luxyoga/vgcpokemonstats)\n\nTL:DR - Data engineering (ETL) project where I scraped monthly datasets from Smogon to create a dashboard for Top Meta Pokemon (up to top 100) each month and their most used items, moveset, abilities, nature etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pz6hr8zwxymf1.png?width=2896&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c6b5b6ca15f64665fb72dc98acd4d03d665a7b6\n\n",

        "content": "I hope this is the right sub to get some technical advice. I'm working on replicating the native “Total Sales by Referrer” report inside Shopify using the Fivetran Shopify connector.\n\nGoal: match Shopify’s Sales reports 1:1, so stakeholders don’t need to log in to Shopify to see the numbers.\n\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n* Built a BigQuery query joining across order, balance\\_transaction, and customer\\_visit.\n* Used order.total\\_line\\_items\\_price, total\\_discounts, current\\_total\\_tax, total\\_shipping\\_price\\_set, current\\_total\\_duties\\_set for Shopify’s Gross/Discounts/Tax/Shipping/Duties definitions.\n* Parsed \\*\\_set JSON for presentment money vs shop money.\n* Pulled refunds from balance\\_transaction (type='refund') and applied them on the refund date (to match Shopify’s Sales report behavior).\n* Attribution: pulled utm\\_source/utm\\_medium/referrer\\_url from customer\\_visit for last-touch referrer, falling back to order.referring\\_site.\n* Tried to bucket traffic into direct / search / social / referral / email, and recently added a paid-vs-organic distinction (using UTM mediums and click IDs like gclid/fbclid).\n* For shipping country, we discovered Fivetran Shopify schema doesn’t always expose it consistently (sometimes as shipping\\_address\\_country, sometimes shipping\\_country), so we started parsing from the JSON row as a fallback.\n\nBut nothing seems to match up, and I can't find the fields I need directly either. This is my first time trying to do something like this so I'm honestly lost on what I should be doing.\n\nIf you’ve solved this problem before, I’d love to hear:\n\n* Which tables/fields you leaned on\n* How you handle attribution and refunds\n* Any pitfalls you ran into with Fivetran’s schema\n* Or even SQL snippets I could copy\n\nNote: This is a small time project I'm not looking to hire anyone to do",

This is basically an e-commerce store from where users can rent DVDs of their favorite movies and tv shows.  \nThink of it like a real-world product that we are developing.  \n\\- It will have a frontend  \n\\- It will have a backend  \n\\- It will have databases  \n\\- It will have data warehouses for analytics  \n\\- It will have admin dashboard for data visualization  \n\\- It will have microservices like ML, Notification services, user behavior tracking  \n  \nEach component of this product will be a project in itself, this will help us in learning and implementing solutions in context of a real world product hence we will be able to understand all the things that are missed while learning new technologies.  We will also get an understanding the development journey of any real world project and we will be able to create projects with professionalism.\n\nThe first component of this project is complete and I want to share this with you all.\n\nThe most important component of this project is the Data. The data component is divided into 2 parts:-  \n**Content Metadata** and **Transactional Data.** The content data is the metadata of the movies and tv shows which will be rendered on the front end. All the data related to transactions and user navigation will be handled in the Transactional Data part.\n\nAs content data is going to be document based hence we will be use NoSQL database for this. In our case we are using **MongoDB.**   \nIn this part of the project we have created the modules which contain the methods to fetch and load the initial bulk data of movies, tv shows and credits in our MongoDB that will be rendered on the frontend. The modules are reusable, hence using this we will be automating the pipeline. I have attached the workflow image of the project yet.   \nFor more information checkout the GitHub link of the project: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Kartikrast/dvd-rental-data-pipelines)\n\nNext Steps:-\n\n\\- automating the bulk loading pipeline  \n\\- creating a pipeline to handle and updates changes[](https://github.com/Kartikrast/dvd-rental-data-pipelines)\n\nPlease fam check this out and give me your feedback or any suggestions, I would love to hear from you guys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r0uod4ajxcnf1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a85d14e118e455b63bd353d27e53b611c37439a\n\n",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello everyone, I'm new to data lakes and I'm facing a challenge with data replication.\n\nI've set up a data lake on AWS using S3 for storage, AWS Glue for ETL, and Athena for queries. I'm using AWS DMS to replicate data from an on-premises Oracle database to S3.\n\nThe problem is with **Change Data Capture (CDC)**. DMS pulls all events from the archived redo logs, including inserts, updates, and deletes. This means my Parquet files in S3 have an `op` column that indicates the type of operation (`I`, `U`, `D`).\n\nFor example, if I query my Oracle database for a specific order with ID `123`, I get a single record. But in Athena, I might get up to 30 records for that same order ID because it was updated many times. Worse, if a record is deleted in Oracle, it still exists in my Athena table, maybe with multiple update records and a final delete record.\n\nEssentially, my Athena table is a log of **events**, not the current **state** of the data.\n\nI've found a temporary fix by adding timestamp and SCN (System Change Number) columns, which lets me write complex queries to find the most recent state. But these queries are huge and cumbersome compared to simple queries in Oracle.\n\nI need a better solution for \"sanitizing\" the data. Parquet files are not designed for easy record deletion. I'm trying to figure out the best practice for this.\n\nHow do you guys handle this?\n\n* Do you just accept the complex queries and leave the old records in S3?\n* Do you run a separate process, maybe an AWS Lambda function, to act as a \"garbage collector\" and delete the older records directly from S3?\n* Do you handle this directly in your ETL jobs (e.g., in AWS Glue)? I'm worried about the cost of this since Glue charges by the minute, and this seems like it would be a very expensive operation.\n\nI'm looking for tips and common strategies for deleting or handling these duplicate/event-based records.\n\nThanks!",

I’d love your brutal feedback on whether this is useful in your workflows.\n\nThe approach builds on the Pathway framework (a stream data processing engine with Python wrappers). What we’ve used here are pre-built components already deployed in production by engineering teams.\n\nOn top of that, we’ve just released the Pathway MCP Server, which makes it simple to expose your live ETL outputs and analytics to client apps and downstream services.\n\nCircling back to the example, here’s how you can set this up step by step:\n\n* Capture your data streams as Pathway tables (with CDC built in). [https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/pathway\\_mcp\\_server/](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/pathway_mcp_server/)\n* Define your transformations for aggregations, counts, or joins — they stay current as new rows flow in.\n* Expose the continuously updated tables/analytics via Pathway MCP Server, so other services can query the current state.

I had applied too late for internships and didn’t want to delay my studies, so this was my only option.\n\nThe supervisor told me to build a custom plugin for the checkout page and I was completely lost. I knew PHP but had no knowledge of the WordPress framework. I tried reading the documentation but it was hard to understand and other sources were often outdated. The only real resource I had was a small YouTube tutorial playlist with fewer than a thousand views per video. That became my lifeline. I followed along, learned the concepts, and eventually managed to complete the task. That experience helped me understand the WordPress core and I finally started to make sense of the official documentation. In the end I built a plugin for both the admin side and the user side of the website all by myself. My skills in programming tripled in size, but of course I gained no experience in testing, reviewing and stuff. When I checked recently I saw that my old supervisor is still using the plugin today.\n\nNow I’m studying a higher level degree in the same field. It’s something like a master, though not exactly the same in my country. The big change is that I discovered AI. Whenever I get stuck I use it, but over time I have become too dependent on it. My skills became worse than ever. I still pass my exams, where AI is not allowed, but I can feel my knowledge fading. It feels like I have lost years of experience and become a beginner again.\n\nThere is a guy in my class who never uses AI and I am jealous. Around 90% of the students here rely on AI for assignments, and many fail the exams for this reason, which also feels like a sad reality, yet that guy still scores the highest.\n\nAI can be good sometimes, but it's a virus on you. If you use it too much, you can't stop. I wish I had never discovered AI, that would be a time when I could at least show my skills and knowledge, but today I feel like a dumb ass who is no different from those who use AI in my class and suck at coding without it.\n\nLong story, but it happened to me sadly. I decided to build some projects without AI and it’s been doing good. It’s like a memory refreshment. I plan to build a simple PHP framework soon, as my final internship is coming up to graduate fully. Don't rely on AI too much guys. The love of programming is building yourself. That's also why I chose this path.\n",

From zero experience to code delivering myself. :-D\nI did a small project myself, never worked as programmer or coded in pair or read a someone else's code. I also have no IT background, from blue collar to Python backend programmer.\n\nAnd now I got a very bad CR on my code. My code was working, but it didn't fit expectations well. Too many things I didn't consider. I had to modify few endpoints with few more data, so I digged into the project I don't understand fully, but I found the way where to get those data, how to validate them, format them and send them. Okay, working.\nBut every piece of my code I got to rework. I have to agree, they are right with that and I admit their solution is better, my was just 'working', but not following the conventions, rules and architecture.\n\nAnd I just feel dumb. I ask why didn't I realize that. Maybe I look dumb and they will fire me because I am really dumb and not competent enough.\n\nI have to say, I never pushed buggy code. Always working and fitting the requirements of outcome; always written and passing tests.\nBut never got aproved without reworking. There was always at least one thing to redo better, in terms of consistency, readability or just for a reason they find useful in future while I didn't see it. (Like when they consider future plans of features and they know this detail will become handy in future).\n\nSo maybe I ask for reassurance. Or for warning if I am really in danger and have to improve asap because I am not enough to compete juniors.\n\nJust tell me your opinion or your experience.\n\nEDIT: they are super nice to me, like \"don't worry, just improve it, here is how\", they answer my questions and help me. I just feel as a burden now.",

There are no test cases or documentation, only vague comments. The variable and function names are mostly nonsensical. Every time a bug occurs, I have to spend hours stepping through the code in debug mode.\n\nHow can I safely refactor code like this?\n\nMy plan is:\n\n**Create test cases**. It's hard to write tests because the expected inputs and code-flow are unknown. To overcome this, I am planning to add detailed logging to the function. The goal is to capture its behavior with various inputs and use those logs to generate a reliable set of test cases.\n\n**Refactor the logic**. Once I have some tests, I can try to reduce the nested if/else statements by extracting logic into smaller methods and using guard clauses.\n\n\nWhat else can I do?

        "content": "I've been doing a little research on different approaches to structuring your projects, and so far I've heard of (and read the wikipedia pages on) OOP, Data Oriented Design, and Functional Programming.\n\nI'm most familiar with OOP, and I find it quite intuitive as well, however during my research I've inadvertently stumbled into discourse about its viability. One argument I keep seeing repeated as one of the cardinal sins of OOP is that its structure encourages statefulness somehow. I understand the difference between stateful and stateless programs, but I struggle to think of a practical reason for reducing states.\n\nA lot of the applications of programming I can think of depend on state in some way or another (Saving and loading a game, text editors, email clients, image converters, etc.), and it feels like there is little to no point in having stateless programs as they would lack the ability to do anything because they would not be able to interact with other parts of the project.\n\nEssentially, my questions boil down to:\n\n1. Why is statefulness considered bad?\n2. How does OOP encourage statefulness?\n3. And finally, why is statelessness preferred over statefulness?",

Is there a strategy or habit for this, or is it just experience over time?\n",

My thought-process is basically \"if I don't know how it ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE VISUALLY, I don't know what to do/type\". It just occurred to me that despite not being exactly a newbie-programmer, I've never really successfully solved my problems myself. The solutions I get is always from EXACTLY copying a sample source or someone else's code. You ever heard of the saying \"figure it out yourself\"? I literally cannot do that; I just don't have the mental capacity to do so. I have to copy, or I can't do anything.\n\n  \nTechnically I can understand high-level concepts to a degree, but at the end of the day I'm always going to say \"yeah.., I get it.., I understand the concept here but....., do you have a sample I can look at?\". I really think there's a certain level of hard-requirement for being proficient at any technical skill, and that is to be able to implement something by actually \"figuring it out yourself\"; for times where you just don't have access to resources like documentation or online source codes, online tutorials, etc..., and I think even till now, I just never met this IQ-requirement. You could even pass me a sample code and say \"see this section of the code? Just change it a bit....\", and I will ask you \"okay sure.., but do you have a sample of how that looks like?\"\n\nI guess I really do qualify as de-facto brainless. I don't really know what to do about that, to be honest. Does anyone have a sample on this?\n\n(Edit: No, I'm not trying to make a joke there)",

We started from the basics like logic, algorithms, flowcharts, pseudocode and then moved on to JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and React. On the side, I also learned a bit of Python, mostly basic backend and some data analysis but nothing past tutorials. \n\nIn 2022 I stopped coding for several reasons mainly due to family issues and low self-esteem. I even fumbled a trial opportunity at a company because I couldn’t finish the final project, I felt like I wasn't good enough to do a good job compared to the other ppl in the program; so I just dropped programming altogether and didn't really touch it for years. \n\nNow in 2025 I feel like I’m in a better mental state than a few years ago, but I feel kinda lost on where to start, specially with AI advancing so quickly, I sometimes doubt whether I'll be able to get a job out of it. On top of that, I don’t know where to start since I’ve forgotten so much. Should I go back to basics, or jump straight into a project and learn as I go checking documentation? I'm also afraid I will rely on AI too much and not learn much at all. ",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI feel pretty lost right now and could use some advice.\n\nI study bioinformatics, and to graduate I need to pass C++ and Python (Data Structures) classes. The issue is… programming has always been the hardest part of my degree.\n\nMy very first programming course happened only after I got  into a new university (previously I was a medical student). It was super intense, and I kept getting stuck — partly because of the new concepts, partly because of the language barrier. Whenever I open the course lectures, I keep thinking: “I failed this once, I’ll fail it again.” Most of my progress is based on the other (more friendly) courses and repeating for a year what I failed. Not so good strategy for the future.\n\nI actually like courses focused on specific applications (like Data Visualization or Command Line). But when it comes to the core syntax and basics of a language, I freeze. It feels like all my preparation goes to waste, because instead of practicing I spend my energy being afraid of the subject itself.\n\nI’ve seen the advice “pick a project idea and use it to learn,” but I’ve gotten too comfortable with Python, and switching to C++ feels overwhelming. And I guess it’s useless to jump into projects if you’re still struggling with how C++ works at the most basic level.\n\nSo I’m not really looking for project ideas right now — more like beginner-friendly routine: small daily/weekly practices, habits, or study approaches that helped you when you were learning a new language. I guess what I’m really trying to do is get rid of the feeling that I’m “too much of a bio/med” to ever be good at programming.\n\nIf you’ve ever been stuck in a similar way, I’d also love to hear your stories — what helped you break through and maybe even find joy in programming on a more consistent basis.\n\nIt feels kind of embarrassing to admit this to professors — after two years in an informatics program, I feel like I should already be past this point. But right now, I’m just stuck and don’t want to waste another year circling the same fear.",

I thought I always was good at this, but since last semester, I feel everyone around me talk about things I don't understand, yet my classmates act like I should understand them now. \n\nThe protect for that semester was to build an online app of our choosing in teams of 5. At the start with the theory and project planning, I was really contributing to the work, but the instant we had to actually start coding, I became nearly useless. \n\nThey wanted to mount a git repository, which they shared to me so we all had it locally with our own branches. But I straight up told them I had never done that and ask for help. They just told me to check the readme.\n\nI spent almost 2 weeks trying to follow the instructions, but it was useless, and at that point, my teammates didn't even understand what I was struggling with. I had to ask the teacher directly for help, and he had to guide me step by step to actually set it up.\n\nWith that guidance, I noticed the amount of things I missed. I didn't have it clear what a repository even was (and I still don't tbh), I thought things like node.js and java script were programs that I had to install, I never used cli in my life, dependencies still confuse me, I have never use docker, and many, many more. \n\nMy experience programming was reduced to using Eclipse IDE and occasionally Visual Studio Community. Everything else that my classmates were talking about and using were completely alien to me. \n\nI talked with some classmates at the time that weren't my teammates, and all their advice and instructions were falling deaf to me. To the point that one of them straight up asked me: \n\n\"What the hell are you even doing here, and how the fuck did you even get this far?\"\n\nThey even asked me what does anybody need to program in java, and I said confidently \"Eclipse IDE\". Their faces were filled with both worry and contained laughter. \n\nAll this time, the only things that I worked with were theory, and coding the instructions in a java file. I don't seem to have learned anything else that I should've by now. There's such a gap where I can't ask for help in ways they understand, and they can't comprehend what could I be having troubles with. \n\nI'm doing my residencies now, continuing the work on a project with a teacher as my guide that apparently thinks I can do a good job, and I feel I'm hitting the same roadblock. The protect is in docker containers that I've been trying to get to work for 3 days to no success.\n\nIs this something I should worry about? And is there anything I can do to actually learn things? \n\nI genuinely feel like I should start the career all over again",

I haven't made anything advanced on my own yet and i am somewhat familiar with HTML and Python and i am still getting familiar with CSS. So how would someone like me progress from here and try to improve, whilst having fun (cuz truthfully speaking my attention span isn't looking too good), understanding fundamentals and syntax and just try to feel more comfortable programming and less intimidated by the console.\n\nThanks for reading my long somewhat coherent rant, and i appreciate all the answers and advice i can get :)",

It actually released about 2 years ago, but I've been adding new content to it, and due to feature creep and edge cases being added continuously that were not planned for at the start of the project, it's led to a huge amount of band-aids, hard-coding, god classes, tightly coupled dependencies, and code split between classes that may have originally had a single, clear responsibility, but have become Frankenstein monsters over time.\n\nI've cleaned up tiny pieces of code here and there, but I'm at a point where changes are becoming absurdly difficult to implement. I'm wondering if there are any free tools that would be able to help me refactor my codebase.\n\nSome of the features that come to mind as things that would be helpful (which I'm hoping extensions for Visual Studio exist for):\n\n* Being able to move a method or variable from one class to another, automatically updating all references.\n   * Additionally, tools that identify tendencies of certain classes to reference each other and make recommendations based on that to address tight coupling.\n* A tool that makes it easy to compare several classes and their methods at once, perhaps with a way to color code them based on what other classes they reference and to categorize them (such as \"this method is in the right place,\" \"this method might be in a bad place,\" \"these functions do similar things but are spread across different classes instead of being in a single dedicated class.\")\n* Some way to reduce redundancy where two variables do ALMOST the same thing (I'm aware this has extremely high potential for causing more issues and is almost certainly something that cannot be solved automatically.)",

However this requires a lot of joins, and im worried its inefficient.\n\nIf it is helpful, i have attached a json style structure of my current setup: [https://gist.github.com/jokerhutt/7ba4bbd85464a4e2f7821494a685ee18](https://gist.github.com/jokerhutt/7ba4bbd85464a4e2f7821494a685ee18)\n\nApart from finding a users next lesson, i also need to figure out which lessons have been passed and which are locked. With my current setup i'd somehow need to mark all lessons with a lower order\\_index in the current unit as passed, then all units with a lower\\_order index in that section as passed, and all units and lessons in previous sessions as passed. For this would it be better to just have a status column in the lessons table / append that as part of a lessom dto for the frontend to know?\n\ni hope the issue makes sense, thank you guys so much in advance!",

        "content": "Hey guys!   \nSo, I am going to be entirely honest over here. I studied basic Data Structures and Algos in the 9th grade back in school in India in Java. I had a lot of visual learning because we had a really good teacher who animated algorithms, and explained it really well. I understood the basics so well back then, and I was able to write a lot of basic code and felt like I had a lot of interest toward the subject. So I went ahead and enrolled to study a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Our college had a really outdated syllabus, and would make us write code on paper, and had horrible teachers. The only thing I really kept up with was math. Right after I graduated, I felt shitty about just barely passing what I thought I had interest in. I moved to the US, and enrolled in a UX UI Bootcamp at UC Berkeley and liked what I studied. Learnt some front end development and got a job at a startup, just to get laid off a few months later. After that, I really fell off the bandwagon and never studied. I feel rusty. It's been 2 years since I got laid off, but I am gaining an interest again to learn. I dont know how much the market has progressed, I dont know how much the field has progressed, I dont know where to start, or what to learn. I learn things best visually. \n\nI want to have a step into the door to learn development, and ML, and backend dev. I want to bag a job soon too. \n\nHow realistic does this really sound? IS there any resources you all recommend? Any ways you have done it? I am terrified as much as I am excited. \n\nThanks! ",

Then, with the basics down in Python, moved on to HTML. Learning with FreeCodeCamp full stack curriculum now, like it better as there is more involvement and actual coding. Should I just continue with the course (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, front end libraries, and then Python) or should I finish Python first and then move on to the front end?

I feel as though I may be behind others or that I don’t put enough work in. I love technology and knew this is what I wanted from a very young age but I think it is the time management that gets me. I spend about 6-8 hours at work 5 days a week, and then do schoolwork for about 2/3-5 hours a day. I also try to balance having a social life because as of last year I barely went out with friends or even had any. I keep wondering if that is just a sacrifice I need to make in order to have more time to learn code and other skills for my degree. \n\nto give more information: \n\nAs of right now, I am taking DSA (Data Structure and Algorithms). Other classes I have taken that retain to my degree so far are: \n- Front-End Web Development\n- Network and Security foundations\n- Scripting and Programming foundations\n- Intro to Python\n- Version Control\n- IT leadership foundations \n- Web development foundations \n\nI have remade a resume that has my updated skills and classes, but when it comes to a portfolio and projects, should I already have multiple? What is the normal amount of experience and skills that I need in order to land an internship. What all do I need to have learned or do I need to put in the extra work to learn more. I see posts saying acronyms and terms that I have yet to learn and feel like there is gaps when it comes to me attempting a software project. Should I put more time aside in order to catch up? I know people say the more serious you are the more work you’ll put in so how far do I need to take that in this situation? \n\nAnd just to add, I do not care to put whatever time aside that I need to, in order to be successful. I’m just having a hard time seeing exactly how much time I do need to be devoting to this and if it is a necessary thing to do, or if more skills and knowledge will come to me as the  school years go on.

(Probably the best solution I’ve seen, but risky)\n\n- make a private repository for it (I think the whole account has to be private, so this is not ideal for an aspiring programmer, but still a good choice)\n\n- don’t use homework as GitHub material due to low value things.\n\nMy thing is this: obviously you wanna steer clear of ‘nail on the head’ type of direct uploads for homework. That is fine. But if the numbers don’t match and there are some customizations in the code, is there really a problem there with university plagarism? Maybe, maybe not.\n\nI would argue that it’s worth uploading and documenting everything from ‘Hello World’ to the final project. Because *that is the benefit of being in a program- you have a structured support and prompts in building things*.\n\nI Just don’t wanna get knocked for it, and wonder what others are thinking, and *if I need to drop this as a worthy venture at all*\n\nThanks.",

All they do is yap in meetings and townhalls.\n\nJust yesterday, I met this director of ML in my org and asked some questions on the use case I had in my mind, since I want to build a POC. All he told was he can get me in touch with the correct people and then went on to yap about goals and visions regarding ML in the org. \n\nI opened his LinkedIn profile. He is a BA in English, been working here for 15+ years. He started as a subscription analyst, became a PM and now an ML director. Never wrote a line of code in his life.\n\n\nI don't expect management people to know every detail but atleast they should be someone who has worked on the codebase, built things rather than just building roadmaps. He is not exception. There was another engineering VP who was an MBA.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Something that I'm realizing more and more is that even at the best companies, technical skills are usually not the differentiator. The key mover is in presentation/ politics.\n\nThis is because management, even if technical, don't have the time or ability to actually understand the work that is being done. At best, they get a high-level understanding of it. How that work is presented is much more important than the actual quality or quantity of work being done.\n\nWhen it comes to quality, it often looks better to build something passable that breaks a year later and do it fast than to build something that lasts a decade but takes a bit longer to build. Management almost always prioritizes short-term speed of delivery vs long term quality.\n\nThere's also the idea that dev work always sounds easier than it is unless broken down into smaller steps. Everyone knows that building a skyscraper is complicated and takes a long time. Building a website or an API seems easy until you explain all of the individual pieces needed to build that website or make that API. Yeah, we'll need a database, hosting, security, handling for payments, etc - and each of those can be broken down into much smaller pieces as well. It's not as simple as grabbing a cool wordpress design and swapping out the text.\n\nI think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.\n\nSo many devs end up doing work for people who don't even understand what they're asking for. This means that the ones asking definitely don't understand what separates good or bad quality work. Hence, the differentiator ends up being presentation/ politics or the gaming of performance metrics.",

Therefore, obviously compared to a guy like me who only likes software development but wouldn’t actively be writing codes for fun, especially after work, he’s more knowledgeable on a lot of things and due to his passion, he’s willing to work 12 hours days when my manager has clearly stated that it’s not at all expected.\n\nI’ve had conversations with my manager regarding him and voiced my concerns.

And I’m also having a hard time keeping up with him on what he is doing and why he’s doing it. I was told not to worry but it still has me wondering. \n\nWhat is my move next?

I know that I can never out compete this guy because I just don’t have that level of passion and willingness to give it all to a job when I have many other things in life that I want to peruse when not working, though with my experience, knowledge and work ethic, I have done a very good job according to my manager and he loves me on the team.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Every time I see people mention it, it always seems like a joke. However, when you think about it, it makes more sense than replacing ICs. Think about it, why do we have so many layers of management in an organization? It's because one person realistically can't keep track of so many people reporting information to them, so instead they have managers report to them all the way up the chain...\n\nThis is where AI comes in. Instead of ICs reporting to managers, they just all report to the AI. Hell, the AI doesn't even need to be reported to because it already knows what everyone has been doing due to monitoring everyone's computers. All the CEO or board of directors needs to do is ask for updates from the AI. They can get very detailed information or high level overviews. No more time wasted on useless 1 on 1s, you just ask the AI how you could do better or the AI will automatically give you feedback or put you on PIP if needed based on a standard set of criteria, so no bias.\n\nThat solves one problem that is faced by large organizations, but how about another one? Think about all the time spent in meetings between managers to only come up with stupid decisions because normally the loudest voice will just win out and it isn't always the smartest. Instead, the AI can interact directly with the SMEs to assess all the information available and make the most informed decisions. Think of the time savings!\n\nIn conclusion, I think we are headed for a time where mid management will no longer exist. A near flat org mostly run by AI will be the most efficient corporate structure and will out compete all of the competition. Boards of directors will be forced to implement this type of structure because otherwise they will be failing their shareholders.\n\nThoughts?",

        "content": "I left my old job a few weeks ago because I was frustrated with the lack of growth and the salary not even keeping up with inflation. I jumped into what looked like a safer and more stable position. The onboarding was smooth and everyone was friendly but then reality hit me on day one.\n\nThe department I joined is basically one guy and now me. The entire workflow is a storm of spreadsheets and manual emails. I realized almost immediately that the whole thing could be automated with a few scripts and dashboards. What currently takes a week could be done in a couple of hours. Which means the existence of the department itself is hanging by a thread.\n\nHere is the catch. To actually automate I would need direct access to the system and that access has to go through my boss. Doing it on my own is impossible without going through him, and going through him means making myself a direct threat to his role and survival.\n\nOn top of that, in just two days of onboarding I was already dumped with actual work, despite only having the most superficial understanding of their processes and tools. The approach was basically “just figure it out.” There is no documentation at all, and to make it worse the processes themselves are arbitrary. One client gets handled one way, another client gets handled completely differently, with no clear rules or references for why things change. It feels random, improvised, and fragile.\n\nTo make things worse the company has its own AI and digital transformation division. If they ever notice what is really going on, they could easily absorb or eliminate this function. Which leaves me in a place where my job is both fragile and painfully boring.\n\nNow I feel stuck. If I leave too soon my résumé will show a disastrous short stay and I will look unreliable. If I stay I risk wasting my time in something that feels pointless and might get axed anyway. Right now my plan is to keep my head down for a while and later reframe the story as “I improved and automated processes and then decided to move toward project or team management because there was no further path in that role.”\n\nI know a lot of people here have been through bad career moves. I just needed to share this because right now it feels like I made one of the worst professional choices of my life",

Hiring managers are looking for passion and self learners. Show evidence, not just say it.\n3. Build am ATS friendly resume. Keywords are important.\n4. Take contract work to build experience\n5. Follow up an inteview with additional information that supports that you are a good fit.\n6. The university internship program is the main way new devs get hired because the  organization used that to assess you.\n7. Referrals are important. Some orgs review all referrals\n8. Networking is an important way to get in front of the line. Meetups can make connections. Contribute to open source for recognition purposes.\n9. Take an un-related job in an org and lobby for yourself into the job you want.\n10. Expect to provide references to back up stated experience\n11. Business environment uncertainty means that orgs are not hiring jr positions because risk is lower with sr devs. Nice way of saying, jr positions are very scarce.\n12. The market is so tight that experienced devs available and preferred.\n13. Its a numbers game. Most candidates are similar. So just apply a lot and wish for luck!\n14. Apply as close to the posting of the job as possible. Those are considered first.\n15. Know the company well at interview time \n16. Chances are better at smaller companies.\n17. Resumes get 8 secs of attention. Nobody will look at GitHubs. Nobody looks at cover letters. Hiring managers are short on time.",

        "author": "BananaBerryPi",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I got a message on LinkedIn from my former boss saying that there was a position in his team and that he'd like me to apply. He said the work is good and the company pays well, and I really liked working with him so I decided to apply because I'd like to work with him again and I've been looking for something with better pay anyway.\n\nI started the process with a interview with HR, than interview with the director of the company in my country, then technical interview with one of the people in the team, another interview with one of the main managers but now from the US. A week after that final one, I got a call from HR saying they want to offer me the position. The pay was way higher from what I'm currently getting (which is very low anyway) and I decided to accept the offer.  I asked the guy to send it to me on a message so I have it written down from them, and that it was an ok for me. He said he'd send the offer letter and that my soon to be manager (who was my former boss) would like to talk to me. I said fine, HR set up an interview and I get a \"welcome to team\" meeting, with them even asking what laptop I'd prefer. \n\nI waited for the said offer letter for two weeks, which during that time I even asked if they needed something else from me because I hadn't gotten it yet and the HR guy told me they were \"waiting on the signature from just one other manager who was traveling at the time and didn't have access to his computer\", but assured me everything else was fine. So I kept waiting for another week, send him a message again talking about starting dates and he goes \"Oh, I'm sorry, I've been laid off last week so I can't help you\". I freak out because wtf and send my former boss a message on LinkedIn saying \"hey, I've been waiting for some time now and I just got a message that guy A is not in the company anymore. Is everything ok?\". He said he'd talk to HR, and I send another email to another HR person that contacted me. This other HR person answers me saying she'll check how everything is going and get back to me (this was on Friday). \n\nSo... I finally get another email from them and it was yet ANOTHER person, and he says he's going to see my process now since guy A is not there anymore, but he informs meet that there was a \"misstep\" in the process and I actually need to go through through another round that includes live coding on Hackerrank because that was mandatory and they didn't do it with me before, so the offer they gave me was not valid. \n\nNow... I'm not sure what to do. I'm between leaving a review on Glassdoor saying how shit the whole process was, that I got an offer, a freaking welcome meeting even and then they were like \"oh actually, forget that\" because what if I'd quit my current job after that? Gladly I waited for a formal signed letter from them, but I could still sue them (according to the laws in my country) since I have their offer on a written message and the email with the welcome meeting setup. Or if I should go ahead and do this next round of tests and interviews to see if they'd give me another offer because the initial one had good pay... But I'm still so pissed at them for the whole thing, it was a complete mess and I'm honestly so tired of doing these long ass 1 to 2 hours talking interviews so many times already... I know they're a real company because I've checked several places and I know two people who work there (my former boss, and another person from a previous company I worked at), but doesn't this feel kinda scammy and all over the place? What would you do?\n\nHonestly, this trying to find something better has been so exhausting... It's either no answers at all, a lot of scams (got offered a \"job\" to pose as another developer while said developer would be working on something else which is basically, well, fraud) or a complete mess like this case.\n\nTL:DR: went through the whole process of interviews, got an offer from the company, a welcome meeting asking me what laptop I'd prefer to then getting an email three weeks later saying there was \"misstep\" in the process and the offer was not valid and that I need another round with live coding on Hackerrank and interviews again.",

        "content": "Im a mid-level engineer who got a new job this year. I was just given my first big project and am working with another mid-level engineer who has been here for about 2 years. We are both working under a PE who is leading the project. \n\nWe have distributed the work and at the start I was wrapping up some bug fixes that my manager asked me to complete. The other mid-level im working with is a really nice guy and he is really motivated which I like. The problem is he is almost too motivated to the point that he has just started coding like crazy and in the first week did some of the work on my plate. I've seen him push code on the weekends at like midnight. One time I asked him if he works onthe weekends and he says sometimes he's bored at home and watches tv and code. I politely let him know that we should work together and I dont want him to feel like he did everything. So he backed off some of my stuff a bit. \n\nBut throughout the project, it seems he is going 150% towards any little changes that need to be added. If we need to add a change, he has just added it. Since he has been here for 2 years, he knows which people to go to outside of us 3 for questions and a few times I heard he had a few meetings with people to discuss things, so i asked him to keep me included as well and to give me any resources of people in case I had questions. He has done better of doing that but a few times forgot to send me some useful stuff.  I was gone for a couple days and in those days he made some major changes. Again I think it's great, but now it feels like the whole code is practically his (maybe 70% of it) and the PE has noticed and even in meetings will talk more to him and say (let's call my co-worker mike for the example) \"Mike can you write a note and make that change\". Barely has directed me. \n\nI feel like I have to step in and say \"ill make this change\" or make it clear that ill do the change. I feel like anything I have discovered ill reach out to him and let him know but I can tell that when it comes to visibility it looks like he's doing 90%. He has done more but I think it's more like 60%-70%. I dont think Mike really is doing this to be spiteful or anything I just think he's one of those people who is just really motivated and just starts and doesnt stop. Again, i think that's great and it definetely has kept me in my feet but I also feel like im getting pushed out. \n\nI should say that I got laid off from my last job before I got this job and i think a reason for it was because I was slightly a more passive engineer and I feel like this could be held against me that Mike did 70% of the work and it may look like I was lazy on this project. \n\nHow can I better handle this situation?",

It was a really stressful period during work. Up to that point I felt I was good. After that I felt I had a lot of flaws and was not good. Now I am in a better team working full time as I finished university this year.\n\nAnd right now I have heightened imposter syndrome. I ask my tech lead every week if my performance is good, do I ask stupid questions, if I do not waste his time with these questions. He always answers all is fine and no time is wasted (He is also great tech lead, I have insane respect for him and my team).\n\nSo I feel bad I keep asking the same question but I also not sure what to do. The stress really stirms me up...\n\nI am also panicking on my performance... I feel I do 50-70% of what my colleagues with similar experience do. I try to improve my focus, ask my roommates to not interrupt but I still I can not get into a flow state. I will have 2-5h of this semi-focused time to get some work done. Other time is at best done on 0 brain power needed tasks or just other things to recharge brain (walk, youtube, etc.). I feel quite bad I can not clock in my time and get work done properly.\n\nLately I asked very basic questions. Like should the HTTP response be 200 (OK) or 201 (Created) for a Create. Why? Because I wanted to know if we have any specific conventions I did spent time investigating if YES, 201 is needed there.\n\nI was doing a PR review and had a call with another dev to discuss of the code is good (It was written by a fresh intern). It looked like should not work. I wanted to discuss with another colleague... After 10min of the call, I spent another hour to debug the code and check how it functions via tests. It worked well. Messaged the MID dev and I felt I wasted his time.\n\nThese questions happened in a span of a 7 days... And might not look anything that bad... but it really messed with my mental... I am not sure how I can escape this imposter syndrome and get better...\n\nI just feel I do not get enough work done, I feel somewhat unmotivated and I feel I waste people's time... Now sure how to systematically fix it.",

Meanwhile, everyone around me are such hardcore techies. They might as well live and breathe code and its been a massive part of their personality for almost their whole life and those same people seemingly just know the ins and outs of everything, even those not that much more senior than me. They talk to eachother about the high level things, and how each team are contributing towards the environment as a whole.

I’m trying to figure out what makes the most sense for my career long-term:\n\n* Should I return to the same FAANG for another internship?\n* Or should I branch out (another FAANG, startup, something in SF) to diversify my experience?\n\nMy main concern is that if I don’t go back, I lose the direct hiring pipeline into this FAANG. If I do a return internship then securing a new grad role is going to be very easy. On the other hand, the role is in Toronto—so the pay is lower than US offices, and the local tech scene doesn’t compare to SF.

        "content": "It's been a few months since I graduated and it feels like my job prospects are sharply going down over time. Clearly the projects on my resume are nowhere near good enough but I have no clue what a realistic \"good project\" is that I could make. It feels like they only care about projects that make significant money, or have millions of users or performs the exact thing their product already does and better. But all of these things feel completely outside of my capabilities? It just feels impossible, like I'm supposed to replicate the efforts of 10s to 100s of expert developers (and people in other disciplines like marketing, graphic design, etc) just to even get some people to look at it and still reject me.\n\nThe projects on my resume already took a while to make but even then they aren't \"impressive\" in any way in the grand scheme of things. When I try to imagine the type of things new grads are \"expected\" to have they just don't measure up at all. Make a meal planner web app with a group for a class project? Well probably someone out there made something better solo and made actual money with that. Make a networked board game with a different group for another class? Well someone out there probably did that exact game idea but better and also made a profit. Make a substantial mod for an old video game that required me to use assembly and reverse engineer game code? Well there are other mods out there that look far more impressive technically even in the time period I made it. (And that reverse engineering sounds like small potatoes to any actual software developer probably even if it took me a long time to figure out? Oh you figured out how to print more digits in the health bar and hunted down every piece of assembly that touched the health value to make it use a bigger data type to increase the maximum? Well in any \"real\" game that process would've been a single line change so they would just think I'm stupid for making it take so long. I told one hiring person about solving a certain bug where I actually used a youtube video of someone playing the mod to help me figure out how to reproduce it but to any real developer it feels very unimpressive, because if I coded it \"right\" in the first place there would be no bug to fix, or if I was more meticulous about every little piece of code I put in I would just know how to catch the bug in the first place)\n\nI just don't know how to make anything good, like I could make some random thing and solve weird and difficult problems and use every technology under the sun but no hiring people would look at it because if it doesn't make money or have a ton of users or looks exactly like the thing they're already making then it's just a dumb toy project to them and I shouldn't even have it on my resume or GitHub in the first place. I don't know how to come up with those ideas that attract money and users or how to fill all my competency holes without spending a ton of money (how to make the perfect graphic design and art that attracts people or how to market a thing to get all those users to use the thing).\n\nI don't know what's wrong with my attitude either, it's obviously wrong to be delusional about the quality of my resume, I have to look at it from a very cynical perspective because hiring people have that exact perspective against job seekers nowadays. If there were any hiring people looking at resumes in a charitable way then I would've gotten a job several months earlier, but that's not the reality we are living in. No amount of thinking \"My ideas are worth a million dollars\" is going to change peoples minds if in reality they are not million dollar ideas, so it is just stupid and delusional to think like that.",

I’m a rising sophomore at a community college in Eastside Seattle, working toward a BS in CS. This will be my third undergrad degree (Kinesiology and Biology, one from a military academy with significant networking benefits). Due to VA and UW policies, I am ineligible to attend UW for CS, either through their undergraduate or bridge-to-master’s program, which would have allowed me to skip another bachelor’s degree. My only option is a third undergrad from another school.\n\nMy concern is employment after graduation. The entry-level CS job market looks tight, and last year I struck out on internships (only Amazon’s veterans program responded, but I was too early in my degree).\n\n1. I enjoy coding and hope to stay in the field.\n\n1. I’m open to CS-adjacent paths (IT, cybersecurity, data science, computer engineering, etc) if prospects are better.\n\n1. Thanks to the VA, I’m financially stable (enough) and could go straight into a master’s after my undergrad if that’s the wiser move.\n\nMain Question: Given today’s market, what’s the most realistic and sustainable path forward for someone in my position?\n\nBonus Question: What should I be doing right now in addition to attending classes to help my prospects?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice.",

It's so crushing when I still haven't had an opportunity to talk to a HUMAN after all of this time.\n\nI hope I'm not the only one who's been going through this. I guess I'm trying to figure out what I have to do to get results. I'm willing to put the work in I'm just confused on what I need to do: Is it my resume that's the issue? Is it the market? Or is this just a volume issue and I need to put in a thousand more. I've always had a passion for CS ever since I was a kid and I went into this major with a love for it but it's starting to fade.\n\nHere's my resume: [https://imgur.com/a/KlAex5v](https://imgur.com/a/KlAex5v)",

However, the company is still not there yet (we are a startup-sized IT firm who just started dabbling in software). \n\nWhat do I do during this point in my career? It's frustrating having learned all of these skills and to produce results without being paid what others in my shoes are getting paid. It's less than intern pay (U.S.). Plus, I'm not some siloed rookie working on a single section of a webpage--I'm a one-man end-to-end systems developer. I've created new capabilities for clients and ourselves through technology. One of my web apps has thousands of daily users. I've automated processes for ourselves and our clients and saved people hours and hours of daily labor. There's still so much more I can learn, and more repetitions would definitely increase my efficiency.

        "content": "tl;dr: [This](https://oops-studio.com/japaneseverbconjugationpractice) is the project. The wall of text below is additional background (since the subreddit wiki said it's important to include that).\n\nI've read all the posts in this subreddit's FAQ section about what projects make good additions to a portfolio and I genuinely cannot figure out if my project falls under that category or not.\n\n* I'm looking for a job in basically any tech-related field, but ideally it would be in software development (either frontend/backend/full-stack web development or desktop app development).\n* I have mid-level skills (probably equivalent to 1-2 YoE) in all the required areas for both of these fields, but I do not have any college education (only highschool).\n* I only have a single instance of professional experience and it was just freelancing for 2 months where I was paid a small amount of money to build a custom web application for someone, but that was when I was 17 and the resulting application is not showcase-worthy in my opinion (very ugly UI and not full-featured).\n* Since I lack both a college education and professional experience, the only thing I have to vouch for me on my resume is my extensive list of personal projects (35 of them over the span of 9 years).\n* Of my 35 personal projects, only about 5 are worth showing off, with the rest being small command-line tools and browser extensions that me and my friends just used to make our lives easier and aren't very impressive.\n* Of the 5 that are worth showing off, 3 of them are hand-coded videogames (no game engine) and 2 of them are webapps. Since I'm not looking for a job as a video game developer, only the 2 webapps are relevant to the jobs I'm seeking.\n\nSo all of this to provide background for my core question: **Is** [this project](https://oops-studio.com/japaneseverbconjugationpractice) **appealing to an employer who's looking to hire an entry-level candidate?**\n\nA lot of people said that the best projects are ones that show you can solve real-world problems and build something that's actually useful for people (including yourself). The app I've linked is an application that helps people learn Japanese by quizzing them on 248 different verb conjugations. I think this project meets (and exceeds) those recommendations, but I still don't feel like it's appealing to employers, and especially not appealing *enough* to make up for my lack of professional experience and college education.\n\nThe project features a fully-custom verb conjugation algorithm that can accept more than 95% of the verbs in all of Japanese and output 248 conjugations for each one. This is something that has been attempted by at least 6 other people and all 6 of them failed (you can find their half-baked attempts with a Google search). As far as I'm aware I'm the only person to have ever pulled this off (likely because I'm one of very few who even tried). In addition to that, this project has seen more than 10,000 users (unique IP addresses that used the site for at least few minutes) since I published it less than a year ago and I've gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback on it from more than 80 different people who reached out to me personally to thank me for building it.\n\nThe problem is **I don't think employers are going to care.** I feel like employers are going to look at my resume for 5 seconds and then toss it in the trash long before ever looking at my project, and the few who do look at my project won't be able to tell that it's technically impressive or that it was loved by so many people. They'll just see the ugly UI, realize that it's \"in Japanese\" (it's not, but it looks like it is), and toss my resume in the trash anyway.\n\nI am more than happy to build more projects and put them on my portfolio (I absolutely love building things), but I don't want to just endlessly waste time building things that employers don't care about. I want a job, and I want to optimize my personal projects to help me get that job as much as I can. So I'd love some input on whether projects like the one I linked are good fits for that or if I need to shift gears and go another route. I'm totally happy either way, I just really want to know so I don't waste months of my time.",

Me and several others got on projects that lasted 2-4 weeks because our managers mislead our clients into thinking we were senior level and we told them we weren't when we started working and weren't as efficient as they expected us to be. \n\nSo, there are questions like explain how you used JIRA to collaborate and work more effectively as a team or a time where you used Spring Boot to increase productivity and enhance a service.   I've used both those tools, but coming up with such details of how I improved a legacy system with spring boot or more than just describing how JIRA works, I don't really have anything else to say.  It's just that I've been mostly working on coding skills and creating some services with the limitations of what I can do in a short time as only one person, and I can't give them the answers they want.  \n\nAm I supposed to lie and repeat other people's answers I find on the internet or is there a way to actually get this level of agile experience without working on an agile team first for long enough.  \n\nOne of those projects over the 3 months was a 2 month project where most of the time we were not doing anything because the client poorly planned the teams and 7 of us on a team that really only needed about 2 people with only a few services and very few bugs coming through on them.  \n\nAre there any teams that are actually designing something new or re-creating services requiring actual coding skills instead of just fixing minor bugs that take about 5 minutes or migrating from something like Maven to Gradle?  It seems all we've ever done is busy work on systems that were outdated and didn't learn anything as all we did was updated packages and fixed vulnerabilities that anyone can do. ",

Asking for status updates on the tasks I stopped working on after he swapped the priority. Getting frustrated that there aren't updates.\n\n5. Meetings that feel more like an interrogation than a useful share of information.\n\n6. Quickly jumps from topic to topic without wrapping up the previous one.\n\n6. Makes decisions very fast without much information at all. This includes creating new meetings, cancelling meetings, creating new outings, letting people off early then asking them to stay for an adhoc meeting, etc.\n\n7.

I could even work 16 hours a day, but I would expect an interesting project and a fair salary.\n\n\nIf not innovative projects, then at least some competition for monopolies (like Adobe, or browsers based on engines other than Chromium or Firefox). But it is also very hard to get into such projects.\n\nIt looks like if I do not find a job for similar money (basically scraps, but still a bit more than McDonald’s and with home office), in another industry, then I will not have a happy career as a developer, even if I have enough skills.\n\nOf course, I could try to create my own product and become a founder. But then you need money for marketing — because even if the software is open source, without promotion nobody will hear about it, and there will be no money. This means hunger, and then going back to software houses to build CRUDs again.\n\nAnd this is exactly how I feel: like a chained dog that never goes for a walk, only sits tied up and howls at night. Except the dog at least does not have to work in scrum sprints, pressed by non-technical managers. \n\n\n*yes I used Ai, but just for clarity cuz I write things chaotically. ",

Furthermore, before reading this, some might say \"did you ask for help\", I did ask for help, I met them face-to-face for help, you can say that I'm borderline stalking them right now. The answer I got is \"do some (more) research\" LOL.\n\nI'm an intern, on week 2 - this week - today, I was given this absolutely questionable codebase, the BE server returns from boolean to string to array to json value, you never know what value type it will return and it's a nightmare to navigate because there is no documentation, there is nothing, the only way you gonna know is to print the result out. There is a log system, EVERYTHING is log in ONE PLACE, the tiniest thing is also logged, 1 request = a massive file containing every single log possible.\n\nFurthermore, each request goes through 2 BE, 1 is the BE server and the other is a low-code platform server BE, and ts suck nuts, because this low-code platform has a request limit and the server is running on an unstable docker image so when either of these thing crashes, you don't know which thing crashed because the person who coded this before me thought it was a good idea to return EVERY SINGLE ERRORS MESSAGE AS ONE and there is no try-catch block.\n\nOh yeah, btw, I'm just an intern but I control the entire live production server of this project, this project doesn't have a development environment, I was tasked to research the dev environment + on top of maintaining abomination codebase + on top of developing new feature, I can literally use \\`rm -rf\\` this entire server.\n\nSo, today I was asked to fix a core function of the BE server, this BE server was created solely for this function. I was able to mitigate it by creating more sessions but this approach was rejected because all sessions have been approved by the client superiors and there is no way to change it and I CAN'T CHANGE THE FUNCTION to fix this because the function is \"working correctly\" based on the customer requirements by my lead, mind you guys although I am alone on this project, I do not received any documentations not even the customer/client requirements.\n\nOh and this job is below minimum wage in my country, I made triple being at mcdonald \n\nAfter the synopsis, I have a few questions or I need advices:\n\n1. Should I quit? Because I do have a better option which is an official employee title and a museum gig which I like\n\n2. If I don't quit? Where should I even start because while I have access to a lot of things, I don't have access to other things",

        "content": "This situation started when my manager randomly re-assigned a project I was working on to someone else. She didn't tell me why or what this meant for me. I wrote up a big document on how to do this, she assigned me tickets from there, but someone else was listed as the lead. I talked to him, and it turned out he had no idea he was the lead of this project. I thought she might have done this simply because she prefers working with this guy, but now it seemed solely vindictive if I was still going to be doing all the work\n\nSo, I reached out to my manager trying to get clarity on what my role in this project was. She got defensive, deflected, asked leading questions, but never truly answered my one simple question: am I supposed to be working on this project or not? If I am, what of the document I wrote, is it still how we're doing it? If I am doing *all* the work, why'd you assign someone else as the lead? She got really frustrated and then eventually threatened to PIP me, so I disengaged.\n\nI went to my skip and talked to him, showing him the conversations. He seemed on my side for this conversation. Since then, I noticed that she had a lot of meetings with him. He told me that if I had conflict with her, I should post it in a public channel. I started doing this when she would nitpick my pull requests endlessly\n\nFor example, I had a storybook instance where I was displaying all the components. She would constantly tell me to change stories, add stories, change how storybook works, etc. Her comments were vague, like \"make it match design\". Neither me nor the lead designer could tell what she was talking about. When confronted about how it \"doesn't match design\", she'd kinda react like \"I'm not telling 🤭\", so I guess I concluded that she was just wasting my time on purpose\n\nSo, I posted in the public channel, which then caused her to come into the thread and act very inappropriately. So much so, I got texts from people (privately) who work there like \"wow what did you do to piss her off???\". At the end, she said to get into a huddle with her, but my skip joined before me. I got in and my skip basically said \"dw we got it figured out\" and I looked at my PR and it was approved\n\nFor a while, she backed off. However, recently I was given a big task to replace every button component across every app with the one from the component library (the project I mentioned before). I did all this, then she left a comment how she didn't like how the button worked. She left no details. She blocked the review and basically said \"button is awkward, go back to the drawing board\". I felt this was solely done to delay me. The button was literally just applying styles to a library (@headlessui/react)\n\nI went back and found the PR where I implemented the one decision she complained about. Not only was it documented in the PR itself, but it had unit tests, comments, and live documentation detailing how it works. It was merged two weeks ago, and she approved it. At this point, I noticed even my coworkers were coming to my defense and calling her unreasonable in the PR\n\nI sent this to my skip and mentioned that I really think I'm being set up for failure here. I showed this PR, but also showed that every PR I submitted was nitpicked endlessly by her while approved by others much quicker. I also showed that she seemed to *only* do this with me, as she approved other team mates PRs quickly\n\nAt this point I'm really lost as to what to do. There is no HR department at my company. There's no team I can transfer to. I'm considering asking my skip to do *anything* to just get me off of her team even if it means becoming a backend engineer at this point. I just can't work with her\n\nWhat can I do in this situation?",

I had three 30 minute calls for the interview process, none of which were real interviews, no coding, etc.\n\nIt took exactly 1 month for me to get an offer.\n\nI'm a tiny bit disappointed with the offer, considering a coworker told me their pay raise in 2022 was 20% with a 5% increase in bonus.\n\nMy offer is 11.5% with no increase in bonus.\n\nI know I don't really have any leverage, but is it worth it to negotiate? Given the context, I don't want to upset my manager given how he says he fought for this.\n\nthe company just had a spectacular Q2 (although that probably doesn't matter). Not sure what to even say tbh.\n\n\nEDIT: I asked to bump it to 15% they said no. I’m glad I asked though.",

        "content": "I've had a very eclectic, non-traditional career path, but now I'm at the point where I no longer know how to market myself. I've been interested in and learning how to write code since I was a teenager (currently in my mid thirties.) I've always done little dumb projects for myself, especially after reading Automate the Boring Stuff a while back.  I've picked up a lot of skills in a variety of tech adjacent things along the way: python (django and flask too), javascript, react, typescript, postgres, nosql, a ton of different AWS services (and less experience but still some with both GCP and Azure), cybersecurity, devops, and more.\n\nI'm currently doing freelance full stack development in Typescript and Python, building an MVP of a web app for a client. I've been doing freelance dev work since being laid off last year, and off and on for the last decade. I like the freedom, but I'd really prefer to work at an early stage startup again (as long as their funded properly), but I don't know how to properly communicate all of my different skills. \n\nWhen I apply to jobs, I almost never hear back from places when I play for engineering roles, and I think it's due to not having many actual software engineer titles. Usually, If I'm applying to jobs and not hearing back, I fall back to applying to customer service roles. One of my managers will eventually realize I've got a ton of technical skills (usually because I'll build some tool or automate something), and I'll get promoted, but not usually to a dedicated tech team (with the exception of my last role, going to the data engineering team.)    \n  \nAs an example, at my last job, I started as a technical support analyst and within a month has been given access to their github, prod db, and AWS (early stage startup that wasn't handling edge cases in customer order data, but also wasn't fixing it, so I did.) That snowballed to me building a bunch of internal tools for the customer service team that were previously only able to be handled by the backend engineers, and eventually becoming a data engineer. \n\n  \nAt another job, I was hired as a customer service rep and saw how tedious a monthly compliance report was to create, so I built an ETL pipeline in python (without knowing it at the time) that turned a 3 day ordeal into a 20 minute gut check. \n\n  \nI'm great at root cause analysis, designing a fix, and implementing it (with consent from the appropriate teams). I've never come across a topic/skill that I can't quickly learn, but also have no issue asking questions on things I'm confused about. I'm good at seeing gaps that aren't being addressed that directly effect the QoL of individual workers and love helping make my co-workers lives easier. \n\nI also have severe ADHD, which hasn't been great for interviews. I've only ever had one live coding interview go well, the rest I start to make increasingly dumb mistakes and then go totally blank. I excel at take home tests, but even when I move along in the interviews on those, I end up losing out to someone with a more traditional background. \n\n\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on how I should market myself to stand out?",
