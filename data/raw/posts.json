        "content": "[This came to my attention in this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k1pl3y/a_databricks_project_a_tight_deadline_and_a_pip/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) One of \\*the big things\\* that separates a data analyst from a data engineer, imo, is whether or not you're capable of testing your code. There's a lot of learners around here right now so I'm going to write this for your benefit. I hope it helps!\n\n# Caveat\n\nI am not a data engineer. I am a PM for data systems, was a data analyst in my previous life, and have worked with some very good senior contributors and architects. I've learned a lot from them and owe a lot of my career success to their lessons.\n\nI am going to try to pass on the little that I know. If you know better than I do, pop into the comments below and feel free to yell at me.\n\nAlso, testing is a wide, varied field, this is a brief synopsis, definitely do more reading on your own.\n\n# When do I need to test my code?\n\nData transformations happen in a lot of different ways. When you work with small data, you might write an excel macro, or a quick little script for manipulation. Not writing tests for these is largely fine, especially when it's something **you** do just for **your** work. Coding in isolation can benefit from tests, but it's not the primary concern.\n\nYou really need to start thinking about writing tests when two things happen:\n\n1. People that are not you start touching your code\n2. The code you write becomes part of a complex system\n\nThe exception to these two rules is when you're creating portfolio projects. You should write tests for these, because they make you look smart to your interviewers.\n\n# Why do I need to test my code?\n\nTests take **implicit** knowledge & context about the purpose of your code / what it does and makes that knowledge **explicit**.\n\nThis is required to help other people start using the code that you write - if they're new to it, the tests help them understand the purpose of each function and give them guard rails as they make changes.\n\nWhen your code becomes incorporated into a larger system, this is particularly true - it's more likely you'll have multiple folks working with you, and other things that are happening elsewhere in the system might necessitate making changes to your code.\n\n# What types of tests are there?\n\nI can name at least 4 different types of tests off the dome. There are more but I'm typing extemporaneously and not for clout, so you get what's in my memory:\n\n* Unit tests - these test small, discrete parts of your code.\n   * Example: in your pipeline, you write a small function that lowercases names and strips certain characters. You need this to work in a predictable manner, so you write a unit test for it.\n* Integration tests - these test the boundaries between different functions to make sure the output of one feeds the input of the other correctly.\n   * Example: in your pipeline, one function extracts the data from an API, and another takes that extracted data and does a transform. An integration test would examine whether the output of the first function results is correct for the second.\n* End-to-end tests - these test whether, given a correct input, the whole of your code produces the correct output. These are hard, but the more of these you can do, the better off you'll be.\n   * Example: you have a pipeline that reads data from an API and inserts it into your database. You mock out a fake input and run your whole pipeline against it, then verify that the expected output is in the database.\n* Data validation tests - these test whether the data you're being passed, or the data that's landing in a given system, are of the expected shape and type.\n   * Example: your pipeline expects a json blob that has strings in it. Data validation tests would ensure that, once extracted or placed in a holding area, the data is both a json blob with the correct keys and the data types for those keys are all strings\n\n# How do I write tests?\n\nThis is already getting longer than I have patience for, it's Friday at 4pm, so again, you're going to get some crib notes.\n\nWhatever language you're using should have some kind of built-in testing capability. SQL does not, unfortunately - it's why you tend to wrap SQL in a different programming language like Python. If you only have SQL, some of what I write below won't apply - you're most likely only doing end-to-end or data validation testing.\n\nStart by writing functional tests. For each function in your code, write at least one positive case (where it gets the correct input) and one negative case (where it's given a bad input that might break it).\n\nTry to anticipate ways in which your functions might fail. Encode those into your test cases. If you encounter new and exciting ways in which your code breaks as you work, write more tests for those cases.\n\nYour development process should become an endless litany of writing code, then writing tests, then testing, then breaking, then writing more tests, then writing more code, and so on in an endless loop.\n\nOnce you've got a whole pipeline running, write integration tests for the handoffs between your functions. Same thing applies as above. You might need to do some mocking - look that up. \n\nEnd-to-end tests - you might need more complex testing techniques for this, or frameworks. If you have a webapp over your data, you can try something like Selenium. Otherwise, not my forte, consult your seniors. You might also need to set up a test environment with some test data. It's expensive time-wise, but this is why we write infrastructure as code (learn that also, if you can).\n\nData validation tests - if you're writing in SQL, use DBT. If you're writing in Python, use Great Expectations. If you're writing in something else, I can't help you, not my forte, consult your seniors.\n\nHappy Friday folks, hope this helped!\n\nTagging u/Recent-Luck-6238, u/FloLeicester, and u/givnv since you all asked!",

I’m here to share the real challenges and sophisticated solutions involved in making it work at scale, based on real project experiences.**\n\n# Context and Motivation\n\nIn recent years, I’ve come across many ideas and projects, ranging from small to large-scale, that involve **scraping data from various sources** to create chatbots, websites, and platforms in industries such as **automotive, real estate, marketing, and e-commerce**. While many technical blogs provide general recommendations across different sources with varying complexity, they often lack specific solutions or long-term approaches and techniques that show how to deal with these challenges on a daily basis in production. In this series, I aim to fill that gap by presenting **real-world examples with concrete techniques and practices**.\n\nDrawing from my experience with well-known titans in the automotive industry, I’ll discuss **large-scale production challenges** in projects reliant on these sources. This includes:\n\n* **Handling page structure changes**\n* **Avoiding IP bans**\n* **Overcoming anti-spam measures**\n* **Addressing fingerprinting**\n* **Staying undetected / Hiding scraping behavior**\n* **Maximizing data coverage**\n* **Mapping reference data across sources**\n* **Implementing monitoring and alerting systems**\n\nAdditionally, I will cover the **legal challenges and considerations related to data scraping**.\n\n# About the project\n\nThe project is a **web-based distributed microservice system aggregator** designed to gather car offers from the most popular sources across CIS and European countries. This system is built for advanced analytics to address critical questions in the automotive market, including:\n\n* **Determining the most profitable way and path to buy a car** at the current moment, considering currency exchange rates, global market conditions, and other relevant factors.\n* **Assessing whether it is more advantageous to purchase a car from another country** or within the internal market.\n* **Estimating the average time it takes to sell a specific car model** in a particular country.\n* **Identifying trends in car prices across different regions.**\n* **Understanding how economic and political changes impact car sales and prices.**\n\nThe system maintains and updates a database of around **1 million actual car listings** and stores historical data since **2022**. **In total, it holds over 10 million car listings**, enabling comprehensive data collection and detailed analysis. This extensive dataset helps users make informed decisions in the automotive market by providing valuable insights and trends.\n\n# High-level architecture overview\n\n[Link to drawio ](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=large-scale-arhictecture.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1H01J4TnB47yhofRdUE3gmuJptIuSmHga%26export%3Ddownload#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22FqT4bm1NmBD6wpKYtjI3%22%7D)\n\n**Microservices**: The system is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for specific tasks such as data listing, storage, and analytics. This modular approach ensures that each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. The key microservices include:\n\n* **Cars Microservice**: Handles the collection, storage, and updating of car listings from various sources.\n* **Subscribers Microservice**: Manages user subscriptions and notifications, ensuring users are informed of updates and relevant analytics.\n* **Analytics Microservice**: Processes the collected data to generate insights and answer key questions about the automotive market.\n* **Gateway Microservice**: Acts as the entry point for all incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices while managing authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.\n\n**Data Scrapers**: Distributed scrapers are deployed to gather car listings from various sources. These scrapers are designed to handle page structure changes, avoid IP bans, and overcome anti-spam measures like finger.\n\n**Data Processing Pipeline**: The collected data is processed through a pipeline that includes data cleaning, normalization, and enrichment. This ensures that the data is consistent and ready for analysis.\n\n**Storage**: The system uses a combination of relational and non-relational databases to store current and historical data. This allows for efficient querying and retrieval of large datasets.\n\n**Analytics Engine**: An advanced analytics engine processes the data to generate insights and answer key questions about the automotive market. This engine uses machine learning algorithms and statistical models.\n\n**API Gateway**: The API gateway handles all incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices. It also manages authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.\n\n**Monitoring and Alerting**: A comprehensive monitoring and alerting system tracks the performance of each microservice and the overall system health. This system is configured with numerous notifications to monitor and track scraping behavior, ensuring that any issues or anomalies are detected and addressed promptly. This includes alerts for changes in page structure and potential anti-scraping measures.\n\n# Challenges and Practical Recommendations\n\nBelow are the challenges we faced in our web scraping platform and the practical recommendations we implemented to overcome them. These insights are based on real-world experiences and are aimed at providing you with actionable strategies to handle similar issues.\n\n# Challenge: Handling page structure changes\n\n# Overview\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in web scraping is handling changes in the structure of web pages. Websites often update their layouts, either for aesthetic reasons or to improve user experience. These changes can break scrapers that rely on specific HTML structures to extract data.\n\n# Impact\n\nWhen a website changes its structure, scrapers can fail to find the data they need, leading to incomplete or incorrect data collection. This can severely impact the quality of the data and the insights derived from it, rendering the analysis ineffective.\n\n# Recommendation 1: Leverage API Endpoints\n\nTo handle the challenge of frequent page structure changes, we shifted from scraping **HTML** to leveraging the underlying **API** endpoints used by web applications (*yes, it’s not always possible*). By inspecting network traffic, identifying, and testing API endpoints, we achieved more stable and consistent data extraction. For example, finding the right API endpoint and parameters can take anywhere from an **hour** to a **week**. In some cases, we logically deduced endpoint paths, while in the best scenarios, we discovered GraphQL documentation by appending `/docs` to the base URL. If you're interested in an in-depth guide on how to find and use these APIs, let me know, and I'll provide a detailed description in following parts.\n\n# Recommendation 2: Utilize Embedded Data Structures\n\nSome modern web applications embed structured data within their **HTML** using data structures like **\\_NEXTDATA**. This approach can also be leveraged to handle page structure changes effectively.\n\n# Recommendation 3: Define Required Properties\n\nTo control **data quality**, define the **required properties** that **must** **be** **fetched** to **save** and use the **data** for further **analytics**. Attributes from different sources can vary, so it’s critical to define **what is required** based on your **domain model** and future usage. Utilize the **Template Method Pattern** to dictate how and what attributes should be collected during parsing, ensuring **consistency** across all **sources** and all types (HTML, Json) of **parsers.**\n\n    namespace Example\n    {\n        public abstract class CarParserBase<TElement, TSource>\n        {\n            protected ParseContext ParseContext;\n    \n            protected virtual int PinnedAdsCount => 0;\n            protected abstract string GetDescription(TElement element);\n            protected abstract IEnumerable<TElement> GetCarsAds(TSource document);\n            protected abstract string GetFullName(TElement element);\n            protected abstract string GetAdId(TElement element);\n            protected abstract string GetMakeName(TElement element);\n            protected abstract string GetModelName(TElement element);\n            protected abstract decimal GetPrice(TElement element);\n            protected abstract string GetRegion(TElement element);\n            protected abstract string GetCity(TElement element);\n            protected abstract string GetSourceUrl(TElement element);\n    \n            // more attributes here\n    \n            private protected List<ParsedCar> ParseInternal(TSource document, ExecutionContext executionContext)\n            {\n                try\n                {\n                    var cars = GetCarsAds(document)\n                    .Skip(PinnedAdsCount)\n                    .Select(element =>\n                    {\n                        ParseContext = new ParseContext();\n                        ParseContext.City = GetCity(element);\n                        ParseContext.Description = GetDescription(element);\n                        ParseContext.FullName = GetFullName(element);\n                        ParseContext.Make = GetMakeName(element);\n                        ParseContext.Model = GetModelName(element);\n                        ParseContext.YearOfIssue = GetYearOfIssue(element);\n                        ParseContext.FirstRegistration = GetFirstRegistration(element);\n                        ParseContext.Price = GetPrice(element);\n                        ParseContext.Region = GetRegion(element);\n                        ParseContext.SourceUrl = GetSourceUrl(element);\n                  \n                        return new ParsedCar(\n                            fullName: ParseContext.FullName,\n                            makeName: ParseContext.Make,\n                            modelName: ParseContext.Model,\n                            yearOfIssue: ParseContext.YearOfIssue,\n                            firstRegistration: ParseContext.FirstRegistration,\n                            price: ParseContext.Price,\n                            region: ParseContext.Region,\n                            city: ParseContext.City,\n                            sourceUrl: ParseContext.SourceUrl\n                        );\n                    })\n                    .ToList();\n    \n                    return cars;\n                }\n                catch (Exception e)\n                {\n                    Log.Error(e, \"Unexpected parsering error...\");\n                    throw;\n                }         \n            }\n        }\n    \n        \n    }\n\n# Recommendation 4: Dual Parsers Approach\n\nIf possible, cover the **parsed** **source** with two types of parsers — **HTML** and **JSON** (via direct access to API). Place them **in priority order** and implement something like **chain-of-responsibility pattern** to have a fallback mechanism if the HTML or JSON structure changes due to updates. This provides a window to update the parsers but requires double effort to maintain both. Additionally, implement rotating priority and the ability to **dynamically** remove or change the priority of parsers in the chain via metadata in storage. This allows for dynamic adjustments without redeploying the entire system.\n\n# Recommendation 5: Integration Tests\n\nIntegration tests are crucial, even just for local debugging and quick issue identification and resolution. Especially if something breaks in the live environment and logs are not enough to understand the issue, these tests will be invaluable for debugging. Ideally, these tests can be placed inside the CI/CD pipeline, but if the source requires a proxy or advanced techniques to fetch data, maintaining and supporting these tests inside CI/CD can become overly complicated.\n\n# Challenge: Avoiding IP bans\n\n# Overview\n\nAvoiding IP bans is a critical challenge in web scraping, especially when scraping large volumes of data from multiple sources. Websites implement various anti-scraping measures to detect and block IP addresses that exhibit suspicious behavior, such as making too many requests in a short period.\n\n# Impact\n\nWhen an IP address is banned, the scraper cannot access the target website, resulting in incomplete data collection. Frequent IP bans can significantly disrupt the scraping process, leading to data gaps and potentially causing the entire scraping operation to halt. This can affect the quality and reliability of the data being collected, which is crucial for accurate analysis and decision-making.\n\n# Common Causes of IP Bans\n\n1. **High Request Frequency:** Sending too many requests in a short period.\n2. **Identical Request Patterns:** Making repetitive or identical requests that deviate from normal user behavior.\n3. **Suspicious User-Agent Strings:** Using outdated or uncommon user-agent strings that raise suspicion.\n4. **Lack of Session Management:** Failing to manage cookies and sessions appropriately.\n5. **Geographic Restrictions:** Accessing the website from regions that are restricted or flagged by the target website.\n\n# Recommendation 1: Utilize Cloud Services for Distribution\n\nUtilizing cloud services like **AWS Lambda**, **Azure Functions**, or **Google Cloud Functions** can help avoid IP bans. These services have **native** **time** **triggers**, can **scale out well**, run on a **range of IP addresses**, and can be **located** in **different** **regions** close to the real users of the source. This approach distributes the load and mimics genuine user behavior, reducing the likelihood of IP bans.\n\n# Recommendation 2: Leverage Different Types of Proxies\n\nEmploying a variety of proxies can help distribute requests and reduce the risk of IP bans. There are three main types of proxies to consider\n\n**Datacenter Proxies**\n\n* **Pros:** Fast, affordable, and widely available.\n* **Cons:** Easily detected and blocked by websites due to their non-residential nature.\n\n**Residential Proxies**\n\n* **Pros:** Use IP addresses from real residential users, making them harder to detect and block.\n* **Cons:** More expensive and slower than datacenter proxies.\n\n**Mobile Proxies**\n\n* **Pros:** Use IP addresses from mobile carriers, offering high anonymity and low detection rates.\n* **Cons:** The most expensive type of proxy and potentially slower due to mobile network speeds.\n\nBy leveraging a mix of these proxy types, you can better distribute your requests and reduce the likelihood of detection and banning.\n\n# Recommendation 3: Use Scraping Services\n\nServices like [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/), [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/), [Brightdata](https://brightdata.com/) and similar platforms handle much of the heavy lifting regarding scraping and avoiding IP bans. They provide built-in solutions for rotating IP addresses, managing user agents, and avoiding detection. However, these services can be quite expensive. In our experience, we often exhausted a whole month’s plan in a single day due to high data demands. Therefore, these services are best used if budget allows and the data requirements are manageable within the service limits. Additionally, we found that the most complex sources with advanced anti-scraping mechanisms often did not work well with such services.\n\n# Recommendation 4: Combine approaches\n\nIt makes sense to utilize all the mechanisms mentioned above in a sequential manner, starting from **the lowest** to the **highest** **cost** solutions, using something like **chain-of-responsibility** pattern like was mentioned for different type of parsers above. This approach, similar to the one used for JSON and HTML parsers, allows for a flexible and dynamic combination of strategies. All these strategies can be **stored** and **updated** **dynamically** as metadata in storage, enabling efficient and adaptive scraping operations\n\n[Something like this ](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*hUD-2QxzISBZkjFNSkDcWA.jpeg)\n\n# Recommendation 5: Mimic User Traffic Patterns\n\nScrapers should be hidden within typical user traffic patterns based on time zones. This means making more requests during the day and almost zero traffic during the night, mimicking genuine user behavior. The idea is to split the parsing schedule frequency into 4–5 parts:\n\n* **Peak Load**\n* **High Load**\n* **Medium Load**\n* **Low Load**\n* **No Load**\n\nThis approach reduces the chances of detection and banning. Here’s an example parsing frequency pattern for a typical day:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5jc2iwglbkve1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4083d72458642f13688d9ccdb9c6c43e2caf181\n\n# Challenge: Overcoming anti-spam measures\n\n# Overview\n\nAnti-spam measures are employed by websites to prevent automated systems, like scrapers, from overwhelming their servers or collecting data without permission. These measures can be quite sophisticated, including techniques like user-agent analysis, cookie management, and fingerprinting.\n\n# Impact\n\nAnti-spam measures can block or slow down scraping activities, resulting in incomplete data collection and increased time to acquire data. This affects the efficiency and effectiveness of the scraping process.\n\n# Common Anti-Spam Measures\n\n* **User-Agent Strings**: Websites inspect user-agent strings to determine if a request is coming from a legitimate browser or a known scraping tool. Repeated requests with the same user-agent string can be flagged as suspicious.\n* **Cookies and Session Management**: Websites use cookies to track user sessions and behavior. If a session appears to be automated, it can be terminated or flagged for further scrutiny.\n* **TLS Fingerprinting**: This involves capturing details from the **SSL**/**TLS** handshake to create a unique **fingerprint**. Differences in these fingerprints can indicate automated tools.\n* **TLS Version Detection**: Automated tools might use outdated or less common TLS versions, which can be used to identify and block them.\n\n# Complex Real-World Reactions\n\n* **Misleading IP Ban Messages**: One challenge we faced was receiving messages indicating that our **IP was banned** (too many requests from your IP). However, the **actual** **issue** was related to **missing** **cookies** for **fingerprinting**. We spent considerable time troubleshooting proxies, only to realize the problem wasn’t with the IP addresses.\n* **Fake Data Return**: Some websites counter scrapers by returning **slightly** ***altered*** ***data***. For instance, the mileage of a car might be listed **as 40,000 km** when the **actual value is 80,000 km**. This type of defense makes it difficult to determine if the scraper is functioning correctly.\n* **Incorrect Error Message Reasons**: Servers sometimes return **incorrect** **error** messages, which can **mislead** the scraper about the **actual** **issue**, making troubleshooting more challenging.\n\n# Recommendation 1: Rotate User-Agent Strings\n\nTo overcome detection based on user-agent strings, **rotate** **user-agent** **strings** regularly. Use a variety of legitimate user-agent strings to **simulate** requests from **different** **browsers** and **devices**. This makes it harder for the target website to detect and block scraping activities based on user-agent patterns.\n\n# Recommendation 2: Manage Cookies and Sessions\n\nProperly manage cookies and sessions to maintain continuous browsing sessions. Implement techniques to handle cookies as a real browser would, ensuring that your scraper maintains session continuity. This includes storing and reusing cookies across requests and managing session expiration appropriately.\n\n**Real-world solution**\n\nIn one of the **sources** we encountered, **fingerprint** information was embedded within the **cookies**. Without this specific cookie, it was **impossible** to **make** **more** than **5** requests in a **short** **period** without being banned. We discovered that these cookies **could** **only** be **generated** by **visiting** the **main** **page** of the website with a **real/headless** **browser** and waiting **8–10** seconds for the page to fully load. Due to the **complexity**, **performance** concerns, and **high** **volume** of **requests**, using **Selenium** and **headless** browsers for every request was impractical. Therefore, we implemented the following solution:\n\nWe ran multiple Docker **instances** with **Selenium** installed. These instances **continuously** **visited** the **main** **page**, **mimicking** **user** **authentication**, and **collected** fingerprint cookies. These **cookies** were then **used** in subsequent **high-volume** **scraping** **activities via http request to web server API**, **rotating** them with other **headers** and **proxies** to avoid detection. Thus, we were able to make up to **500,000 requests per day** bypassing the protection.\n\n# Recommendation 3: Implement TLS Fingerprinting Evasion\n\nTo avoid detection via **TLS** **fingerprinting**, mimic the **SSL**/**TLS** **handshake** of a legitimate **browser**. This involves configuring your scraping tool to use common **cipher suites**, **TLS extensions** and **versions** that match those of **real** **browsers**. Tools and libraries that offer configurable SSL/TLS settings can help in achieving this. [This is](https://scrapfly.io/blog/how-to-avoid-web-scraping-blocking-tls/) **great article** on this topic.\n\n**Real-world solution:**\n\nOne of the sources we scraped started returning **fake** **data** due to issues related to **TLS** **fingerprinting**. To resolve this, we had to create a custom proxy in **Go** to modify parameters such as **cipher suites** and **TLS** **versions**, making our scraper appear as a legitimate browser. This approach required deep customization to handle the SSL/TLS handshake properly and avoid detection. [This is](https://github.com/Skyuzii/SpoofingTlsFingerprint) good example in **Go**.\n\n# Recommendation 4: Rotate TLS Versions\n\nEnsure that your scraper supports multiple TLS versions and rotates between them to avoid detection. Using the latest TLS versions commonly used by modern browsers can help in blending in with legitimate traffic.\n\n# Challenge: Maximizing Data Coverage\n\n# Overview\n\nMaximizing data coverage is essential for ensuring that the scraped data represents the most current and comprehensive information available. One common approach is to fetch listing pages **ordered by** the **creation** **date** from the source system. However, during peak times, new data offers can be created so quickly that **not** **all** offers/ads **can** **be** **parsed** from these pages, leading to gaps in the dataset.\n\n# Impact\n\nFailing to capture all new offers can result in incomplete datasets, which affect the accuracy and reliability of subsequent data analysis. This can lead to missed opportunities for insights and reduced effectiveness of the application relying on this data.\n\n# Problem Details\n\n* **High Volume of New Offers:** During peak times, the number of new offers created can exceed the capacity of the scraper to parse all of them in real-time.\n* **Pagination Limitations:** Listing pages often have pagination limits, making it difficult to retrieve all new offers if the volume is high.\n* **Time Sensitivity:** New offers need to be captured as soon as they are created to ensure data freshness and relevance.\n\n# Recommendation: Utilize Additional Filters\n\nUse additional filters to split data by **categories**, **locations**, or **parameters** such as **engine types**, **transmission types**, etc. By segmenting the data, you can increase the frequency of parsing for each filter category. This targeted approach allows for more efficient scraping and ensures comprehensive data coverage.\n\n# Challenge: Mapping reference data across sources\n\n# Overview\n\nMapping reference data is crucial for ensuring consistency and accuracy when integrating data from multiple sources. This challenge is common in various domains, such as **automotive** and **e-commerce**, where different sources may use varying nomenclature for similar entities.\n\n# Impact\n\nWithout proper mapping, the data collected from different sources can be fragmented and inconsistent. This affects the quality and reliability of the analytics derived from this data, leading to potential misinterpretations and inaccuracies in insights.\n\n# Automotive Domain\n\n**Inconsistent Naming Conventions:** Different sources might use different names for the same make, model, or generation. For example, one source might refer to a car model as “**Mercedes-benz v-class**,” while another might call it “**Mercedes v classe**”\n\n**Variations in Attribute Definitions:** Attributes such as **engine types**, **transmission types**, and **trim levels** may also have varying names and descriptions across sources.\n\n# E-commerce Domain\n\n**Inconsistent Category Names:** Different e-commerce platforms might categorize products differently. For instance, one platform might use “**Electronics** \\> **Mobile Phones**,” while another might use “**Electronics** \\> **Smartphones**.”\n\n**Variations in Product Attributes:** Attributes such as brand names, product specifications, and tags can differ across sources, leading to challenges in data integration and analysis.\n\n# Recommendation 1: Create a Reference Data Dictionary\n\nDevelop a comprehensive **reference data dictionary** that includes all possible **names** and **variations**. This dictionary will serve as the central repository for mapping different names to a **standardized** set of terms. Use **fuzzy** **matching** **techniques** during the data collection stage to ensure that similar terms from **different** **sources** are accurately matched to the standardized terms.\n\n# Recommendation 2: Use Image Detection and Classification Techniques\n\nIn cases where **certain** **critical** **attributes**, such as the **generation** of a car model, are not always available from the sources, **image** **detection** and **classification** **techniques** can be employed to identify these characteristics. For instance, using **machine learning** models trained to **recognize** different car **makes**, **models**, and **generations** from **images** can help fill in the gaps when textual data is incomplete or inconsistent. This approach can dramatically **reduce** the amount of **manual** **work** and the need for constant updates to mappings, but it introduces complexity in the **architecture**, **increases** infrastructure **costs**, and can **decrease** **throughput**, **impacting** the **real-time** nature of the data.\n\n# Challenge: Implementing Monitoring and Alerting Systems\n\n# Overview\n\nImplementing effective **monitoring** and **alerting** systems is **crucial** for maintaining the health and performance of a **web** **scraping** **system**. These systems help detect **issues** **early**, **reduce** **downtime**, and ensure that the data collection process runs smoothly. In the context of web scraping, monitoring and alerting systems need to address specific challenges such as **detecting** **changes** in **source** **websites**, **handling** **anti**\\-**scraping** **measures**, and **maintaining** **data** **quality**.\n\n# Impact\n\nWithout proper monitoring and alerting, issues can go unnoticed, leading to incomplete data collection, increased downtime, and potentially significant impacts on data-dependent applications. Effective monitoring ensures timely detection and resolution of problems, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the scraping system.\n\n# Recommendation: Real-Time Monitoring of Scraping Activities\n\nImplement real-time monitoring to track the performance and status of your scraping system. Use tools and dashboards to visualize key metrics such as the number of successful requests, error rates, and data volume. This helps in quickly identifying issues as they occur.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5nwszripbkve1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afb2b969b74185d2fea25cbf3a3035a1e09910b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfxjyvtsbkve1.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e07abd91acfc6aee485a9926207a032b135b97c\n\n# Funny Stories at the End\n\nOur system scraped data continuously from different sources, making it highly sensitive to any downtime or changes in website accessibility. There were numerous instances where our scraping system detected that a website was down or not accessible from certain regions. Several times, our team contacted the support teams of these websites, informing them that “User X from Country Y” couldn’t access their site.\n\nIn one memorable case, our automated alerts picked up an issue at 6 AM. The website of a popular car listing service was inaccessible from several European countries. We reached out to their support team, providing details of the downtime. The next morning, they thanked us for the heads-up and informed us that they had resolved the issue. It turned out we had notified them before any of their users did!\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nBuilding and maintaining a **web** **scraping** **system** is **not an easy task**. It requires dealing with **dynamic** **content**, **overcoming** sophisticated **anti**\\-**scraping** **measures**, and **ensuring** high **data** **quality**. While it may seem naive to think that parsing data from various sources is straightforward, the reality involves constant vigilance and adaptation. Additionally, maintaining such a system can be costly, both in terms of infrastructure and the continuous effort needed to address the ever-evolving challenges. By following the steps and recommendations outlined above, you can create a robust and efficient web scraping system capable of handling the challenges that come your way.\n\n# Get in Touch\n\nIf you would like to dive into **any** of these **challenges** in detail, please **let me know in the comments** — I will describe them in **more** **depth**. If you have any questions or would like to share your use cases, feel free to let me know. Thanks to everyone who read until this point!",

        "content": "# The Problem \n\n**Let’s cut to the chase:** running Kafka in the cloud is expensive. The **inter-AZ replication** is the biggest culprit. There are excellent write-ups on the topic and we don’t want to bore you with yet-another-cost-analysis of Apache Kafka - let’s just agree it costs **A LOT**!\n\n[1 GiB\\/s, with Tiered Storage, 3x fanout Kafka deployment on AWS costs \\>3.4 million\\/year!](https://preview.redd.it/930a20t0ckve1.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=8971b9c98d984bc34dc2b7e20dc5ef580716d01c)\n\nThrough elegant cloud-native architectures, proprietary Kafka vendors have found ways to vastly reduce these costs, albeit at higher latency.\n\n**We want to democratise this feature and merge it into the open source.**\n\n# Enter KIP-1150 \n\n[KIP-1150](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1150%3A+Diskless+Topics) proposes a new class of topics in Apache Kafka that delegates replication to object storage. This completely eliminates cross-zone network fees and pricey disks. You may have seen similar features in proprietary products like Confluent Freight and WarpStream - **but now the community is working to getting it into the open source**. With disks out of the hot path, the usual pains—cluster rebalancing, hot partitions and IOPS limits—are also gone. Because data now lives in elastic object storage, users could reduce costs by up to 80%, spin brokers serving diskless traffic in or out in seconds, and inherit low‑cost geo‑replication. Because it’s simply a new type of topic - you still get to keep your familiar sub‑100ms topics for latency‑critical pipelines, and opt-in ultra‑cheap diskless streams for logs, telemetry, or batch data—all in the same cluster.\n\nGetting started with diskless is one line:\n\n    kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic --config topic.type=diskless\n\nThis can be achieved *without* changing any client APIs and, interestingly enough, modifying just a tiny amount of the Kafka codebase (1.7%).\n\n# Kafka’s Evolution\n\n**Why did Kafka win?** For a long time, it stood at the very top of the streaming taxonomy pyramid—the most general-purpose streaming engine, versatile enough to support nearly any data pipeline. Kafka didn’t just win because it is versatile—it won precisely because it **used disks**. Unlike memory-based systems, Kafka uniquely delivered high throughput and low latency without sacrificing reliability. It handled backpressure elegantly by decoupling producers from consumers, storing data safely on disk until consumers caught up. Most competing systems held messages in memory and would crash as soon as consumers lagged, running out of memory and bringing entire pipelines down.\n\n**But why is Kafka so expensive in the cloud?** Ironically, the same disk-based design that initially made Kafka unstoppable have now become its Achilles’ heel in the cloud. Unfortunately replicating data through local disks just so also happens to be heavily taxed by the cloud providers. The real culprit is the **cloud pricing model itself** \\- not the original design of Kafka - but we must address this reality. With Diskless Topics, Kafka’s story comes full circle. Rather than eliminating disks altogether, Diskless abstracts them away—leveraging object storage (like S3) to keep costs low and flexibility high. Kafka can now offer the best of both worlds, combining its original strengths with the economics and agility of the cloud.\n\n# Open Source\n\nWhen I say **“we”,** I’m speaking for Aiven — I’m the Head of Streaming there, and we’ve poured months into this change. We decided to open source it because even though our business’ leads come from open source Kafka users, our incentives are strongly aligned with the community. If Kafka does well, Aiven does well. Thus, if our Kafka managed service is reliable and the cost is attractive, many businesses would prefer us to run Kafka for them. We charge a management fee on top - but it is always worthwhile as it saves customers more by eliminating the need for dedicated Kafka expertise. **Whatever we save in infrastructure costs, the customer does too!** Put simply, **KIP-1150** is a win for Aiven and a win for the community.\n\n# Other Gains\n\nDiskless topics can do a lot more than reduce costs by >80%. Removing state from the Kafka brokers results in significantly less operational overhead, as well as the possibility of new features, including:\n\n* **Autoscale in seconds:** without persistent data pinned to brokers, you can spin up and tear down resources on the fly, matching surges or drops in traffic without hours (or days) of data shuffling. \n* **Unlock multi-region DR out of the box**: by offloading replication logic to object storage—already designed for multi-region resiliency—you get cross-regional failover at a fraction of the overhead. \n* **No More IOPS Bottlenecks**: Since object storage handles the heavy lifting, you don’t have to constantly monitor disk utilisation or upgrade SSDs to avoid I/O contention. In Diskless mode, your capacity effectively scales with the cloud—not with the broker. \n* **Use multiple Storage Classes** (e.g., [S3 Express](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/up-to-85-price-reductions-for-amazon-s3-express-one-zone/))**:** Alternative storage classes keep the same agility while letting you fine‑tune cost versus performance—choose near‑real‑time tiers like S3 Express when speed matters, or drop to cheaper archival layers when latency can relax.\n\nOur hope is that by lowering the cost for streaming we expand the horizon of what is streamable and make Kafka economically viable for a whole new range of applications. As data engineering practitioners, we are really curious to hear what ***you*** think about this change and whether we’re going in the right direction.

I noticed he's on some kind of PIP thing, and the project has a set deadline which is not realistic. It could be both of us are set up to fail. The code is the worst I have seen in my ten years in the field. No tests, no docs, a mix of prod and test, infra mixed with application code, a misunderstanding of how classes and scope work, etc.\n\nThe project itself is a \"library\" that syncing databricks with data from an external source. We query the external source and insert data into databricks, and every once in a while query the source again for changes (for sake of discussion, lets assume these are page reads per user) which need to be done incrementally. We also frequently submit new jobs to the external source with the same project. what we ingest from the source is not a lot of data, usually under 1 million rows and rarely over 100k a day. \n\nRoughly 75% of the code is doing computation in python for databricks, where they first pull out the dataframe and then filter it down with python and spark. The remaining 25% is code to wrap the API on the external source. All code lives in databricks and is mostly vanilla python. It is called from a notebook. (...)\n\nMy only idea is that the \"library\" should be split instead of having to do everything. The ingestion part of the source can be handled by dbt and we can make that work first. The part that holds the logic to manipulate the dataframes and submit new jobs to the external api is buggy and I feel it needs to be gradually rewritten, but we need to double the features to this part of the code base if we are to make the deadline. \n\nI'm already pushing back on the deadline and I'm pulling in another DE to work on this, but I am wondering what my technical approach should be.",

        "author": "SnooAdvice7613",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi folks. My company is trying to switch some batch jobs to streaming. The current method is that the data are streaming data through Kafka, then there's a Spark streaming job that consumes the data and appends them to a raw table (with schema defined, so not 100% raw). Then we have some scheduled batch jobs (also Spark) that read data from the raw table, transform the data, load them into destination tables, and show them in the dashboards. We use Databricks for storage (Unity catalog) and compute (Spark), but use something else for dashboards.\n\nNow we are trying to switch these scheduled batch jobs into streaming, since the incoming data are already streaming anyway, why not make use of it and turn our dashboards into realtime. It makes sense from business perspective too.\n\nHowever, we've been facing some difficulty in rewriting the transformation jobs from batch to streaming. Turns out, Spark streaming doesn't support some imporant operations in batch. Here are a few that I've found so far:\n\n1. Spark streaming doesn't support window function (e.g. : ROW\\_NUMBER() OVER (...)). Our batch transformations have a lot of these.\n2. Joining streaming dataframes is more complicated, as you have to deal with windows and watermarks (I guess this is important for dealing with unbounded data). So it breaks many joining logic in the batch jobs.\n3. Aggregations are also more complicated. For example you can't do this: raw\\_df -> get aggregated df from raw\\_df -> join aggregated\\_df with raw\\_df\n\nSo far I have been working around these limitations by using Foreachbatch and using intermediary tables (Databricks delta table). However, I'm starting to question this approach, as the pipelines get more complicated. Another method would be refactoring the entire transformation queries to conform both the business logic and streaming limitations, which is probably not feasible in our scenario.\n\nHave any of you encountered such scenario and how did you deal with it? Or maybe do you have some suggestions or ideas? Thanks in advance.",

Three blog posts published yesterday conduct deep and comprehensive comparisons of various engines from an unbiased third-party perspective.\n\nDespite the lack of head-to-head benchmarking, these posts still offer so many different critical angles to consider when evaluating. They also cover fundamental concepts that span outside these specific engines.

I recently wanted to do some JOINs on a personal project and realised I kinda suck at them and I actually had to refresh my knowledge on some basics related to HAVING, GROUP BY etc. It just wasn't a significant part of my work over the last 2 years. In fact I use some python scripts I made a long time ago for executing a series of statements so I almost completely erradicated using SQL from my day-to-day.\n\n\nSometimes I feel like I'd join a call with my colleagues or people more junior than me and they could pull up anything and start blasting away any type of code or chain of terminal commands from memory  - sometimes I feel like I'm a retired software engineer and a lot of these things are a distant memory to me that I have to refresh every time I need something.\n\n\nPart of the \"problem\" is that I got abstracted from a lot of things with UI tools. I barely use the terminal for managing or navigating our cloud platform because the UI fits most of my needs, so I couldn't really help you check something in the cluster using the terminal without reading the docs. I also made some scripts for interacting with our cloud so I don't have to execute long commands in the terminal. I also use a GUI tool for  git so I couldn't help you rebase in the terminal without revising how the process goes in the terminal.\n\n\nTL;DR I'm approaching 7 years in this career and I use various abstractions like GUI tools and custom scripts to make my life easier and I dont keep my knowledge fresh on basics.

        "author": "arctic_radar",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "There are two main reasons why I've been testing this. First, in scenarios where you have hundreds of different data sources each with similar data but varying schemas, doing transformations with an LLM would mean you don't have to write hundreds of different transformation processes. manage all of them etc. Additionally, when the those sources inevitably alter their schemas slightly, you don't have to worry about your rigid transformation processes breaking.\n\nThe next use case I had in mind was enriching the data by using the LLM to make inferences that would be time-consuming or even impossible to do with traditional code. For simple example, I had a field that contained mix of individual and business names. Some of my sources included a field that indicated the entity type, others did not. I found that the LLM was very accurate not only for determining whether the entity was an individual or not, but also ignoring the records that did have this indicator already. I've also tested more complex inference logic with similarly accurate results.\n\n I was able to build a single prompt that does several transformations and inferences all at the same time, receiving validated structured output  from the LLM. From there, the data goes through a more traditional SQL transformation process.\n\nI really thought there would be more issues with hallucination, but so far that just hasn't been the case.  The only inaccuracies I've found were in edge cases that would have caused issues with traditional transformations as well. To be fair, I'm using context amounts that are much, much smaller than the models are supposedly capable of dealing with and I suspect if I increased the context I would start to see issues. \n\nI first did some limited testing on this over a year ago, and while I remember being surprised then by how well it worked, the cost made it viable for only small datasets. I just thought it was a neat trick and didn't give it much more thought. But now the models are 20x cheaper in some cases. They are cheap enough now that I can run the same prompt through multiple models and flag anytime they disagree, which is almost always tends to be edge cases when both models were confused because the data itself had issues.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has tested similar processes and, if so, how did your results look? I know my use case may be niche, but I have to think this approach is going to gain popularity as these models get cheaper and more capable over the years. ",

DuckDB runs inside the function.\n- Data: A ~200 MB GeoParquet file in Azure Blob Storage (hot tier).\n- Networking: Web App ↔ Function over VNet integration and Private Endpoints; nothing goes out to the public internet.\n- Data flow: User input → Web App calls /locations → Function queries DuckDB → returns payloads.\n\nOpen questions\n\n\t1.\tFunction vs. always‑on container: Is a serverless Azure Function the right choice, or would something like Azure Container Apps (kept warm) be simpler for DuckDB workloads? Cold‑start worries me a bit.\n\n\t2.\tPayload format: For ≤ 200 k rows, is it worth the complexity of sending Arrow/Polars over HTTP, or should I stick with plain JSON for map markers? Any real‑world gains?\n\n\t3.\tPre‑processing beyond “query from Blob”: I might need server‑side clustering, hexbin aggregation, or even vector‑tile generation to keep the payload tiny.

Anything you wish you’d known before launching a similar setup?\n\nReally appreciate any pointers, war stories, or blog posts you can share. 🙏",

I applied to a bunch of roles, including a few at Meta, but never made it past initial screenings.\n\nFast forward to now — I landed a senior DE position at a well-known crypto exchange about 4 months ago. I’m enjoying it so far: I’ve been given a lot of autonomy, there’s room for impactful infrastructure work, and I’m helping shape how data is handled org-wide. We use a fairly modern stack: Snowflake, Databricks, Airflow, AWS, etc.\n\nA technical recruiter from Meta recently reached out to say they’re hiring DEs (L4/L5) and invited me to begin technical interviews.\n\nI’m torn on what decision would be best for my career: Should I pursue the opportunity at Meta, or stay in my current role and keep building?\n\nHere are some things I’m weighing:\n\n* Prestige: Having work experience at a company like Meta could open doors for me in the future.\n* Tech stack: I’ve heard Meta uses mostly in-house tools (some open sourced), and I worry that might hurt future job transitions where industry-standard tools are more relevant.\n* Role scope: I’ve read that DEs at Meta may do work closer to analytics engineering. I enjoy analytics, but I’d miss the more technical DE aspects.\n* Compensation: I’m currently making \\~$160K base + pre-IPO equity + bonus potential. Meta’s base range is similar, but equity would likely be more valuable and far lower risk.\n* Location: My current role is entirely remote. I would have to relocate to accommodate Meta's hybrid in person requirement.\n\nSo if you were in my shoes, what would you do? I appreciate any thoughts or advice!",

        "content": "**Hi all,**  \nI work in a data consultancy firm as a Data Engineer in Pakistan. I've observed a concerning trend: people working on managed services projects are often engaged throughout the entire day, handling both ETL support and ad-hoc tasks.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Data Engineering role, let me explain what ad-hoc and ETL support tasks typically involve.  \n**Ad-hoc tasks** refer to daily activities such as data validations, new development, modifying data sources, preparing data for frontend and ML teams, and more.  \n**ETL support**, on the other hand, is usually provided outside of standard working hours—often at night—and involves resolving issues and fixing bugs in data pipelines.\n\nThe main problem is that the same resource who works a full 9–5 shift is also expected to wake up at night for ETL support whenever it's needed. ETL errors typically occur 2–3 times a week, and these support tasks can take anywhere from 1 to 5 hours, depending on their complexity and urgency.\n\nMy concern is whether this practice is common across the industry? Wouldn't it be more effective to have separate resources for ETL support and ad-hoc tasks?\n\n**What are your thoughts?**",

I recently came across a Snowflake publication mentioning a new feature: Iceberg REST catalog integration in Snowflake using vended credentials. I'm curious—how was this handled before? Was it previously possible to query S3 tables directly from Snowflake without loading the files into Snowflake?\n\nFrom what I understand, it was already possible using external volumes, but I'm not quite sure how that differs from this new feature. In both cases, do we still avoid using an ETL tool? The Snowflake announcement emphasized that there's no longer a need for ETL, but I had the impression that this was already the case. Could you clarify the difference?",

Would love to hear real-world experiences on what actually scales, especially for large dimensions (10M+ rows) - how do you balance the Spark vs Redshift work while keeping everything consistent?\n\nLast but not least I want to know how to ensure fact tables are properly pointing to dimension tables, do we fill the foreign key column in spark before loading to redshift? \n\nPS: if you have any learning resources with practical implementations and best practices in place please provide them, because I feel the majority of the info on the web is theoretical.   \nThank you in advance.",

Keep in mind, that we cannot just have a local DB as that would require a lot of extra maintenance and manual synching of the DBs, more over, the dummy DB would need to be accesible in the CICD pipeline building the code, so it must easily portable (we actually tried this, by using DuckDB as the local DB but had issues with it, maybe I will post about that on another thread).\n\nSet up:\nCloud - AWS\nRunning Env - EMR\nDB - Aurora PG\nLanguage - Scala\nTest Liv - ScalaTest + Mockito\n\nThe main blockers:\nNo access Secrets\nNo access to S3\nNo access to AWS CLI to interact with S3\nWhatever solution, must be light weight\nSolution must be fully storable in same repo\nSolution must be triggerable in CICD pipeline.\n\n\nBTW, i believe that the CI/CD pipeline has full access to AWS, the problem is enabling testing on our laptops and then the same setup must work on the CICD pipeline.\n\n\n\n",

These instruments are standalone (not connected to the internet), but they might be connected to a computer that has access to a network drive (e.g., an SMB share).\n2. The output files are typically in a binary format. Instrument vendors usually don’t provide parsers or APIs, as they want to protect their proprietary technologies.\n3. In most cases, the instruments come with dedicated software for data analysis, and the results can be exported as XLSX or CSV files. However, since each user may perform the analysis differently and customize how the reports are exported, the output formats can vary significantly—even for the same instrument.\n4. Even if we can parse the raw or exported files, interpreting the data often requires domain knowledge from the lab scientists.\n\nGiven these constraints, is it even possible to build a reliable ELT/ETL pipeline?",

        "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm looking for sincere advice.\n\nI'm basically a data/analytics engineer. My tasks generally are like this\n\n1. put configurations so that the source dataset can ingest and preprocess into aws s3 in correct file format. I've noticed sometimes filepath names randomly change without warning which would cause configs to change so I would have to be cognizant of that. \n\n2. the s3 output is then put into a mapping tool (which in my experience is super slow and frequently annoying to use) we have to map source -> our schema\n\n3. once you update things in the mapping tool, it SHOULD export automatically to S3 and show in production environment after refresh, which is usually. However, keyword should. There are times where my data didn't show up and it turned out I have to 'manually export' a file to S3 without being made aware beforehand which files require manual export and which ones occur automatically through our pipeline\n\n4. I then usually have to develop a SQL view that combines data from various sources for different purposes\n\nThe issues I'm facing lately....\n\nA colleague left end of last year and I've noticed that my workload has dramatically changed. I've been given tasks that I can only assume were once hers from another colleague. The thing is the tasks I'm given:\n\n1. Have zero documentation. I have no clue what the task is meant to accomplish\n\n2. I have very vague understanding of the source data \n\n3. Just go off of an either previously completed script, which sometimes suffers from major issues (too many subqueries, thousands of lines of code). Try to realistically manage how/if to refactor vs. using same code and 'coming back to it later' if I have time constraints. After using similar code, randomly realize the requirements of old script changed b/c my data doesn't populate in which I have to ask my boss what the issue \n\n4. Me and my boss have to navigate various excel sheets and communication to play 'guess work' as to what the requirements are so we can get something out \n\n5. Review them with the colleague who assigned it to me who points out things are wrong OR randomly changes the requirements that causes me to make more changes and then expresses frustration 'this is unacceptable', 'this is getting delayed', 'I am getting frustrated' continuously that is making me uncomfortable in asking questions.\n\nI do not directly interact with the stakeholders. The colleague I just mentioned is the person who does and translates requirements back. I really, honestly have no clue what is going through the stakeholders mind or how they intend to use the product. All I frequently hear is that 'they are not happy', 'I am frustrated', 'this is too slow'. I am expected to get things out within few hours to 1-2 business days. This doesn't give me enough time to ensure if I made many mistakes in the process. I will take accountability that I have made some mistakes in this process by fixing things then not checking and ensuring things are as expected that caused further delays. Overall, I am under constant pressure to churn things out ASAP and I'm struggling to keep up and feel like many mistakes are a result of the pressure to do things fast.\n\nI have told my boss and colleague in detail (even wrote it up) that it would be helpful for me to: 1. just have 1-2 sentences as to what this project is trying to accomplish 2. better documentation.  People have agreed with me but they have not really done much b/c everybody is too busy to document since once one project is done, I'm pulled into the next. I personally am observing a technical debt problem here, but I am new to my job and new to data engineering (was previously in a different analytics role) so I am trying to figure out if this is a me issue and where I can take accountability or this speaks to broader issues with my team and I should consider another job. I am honestly thinking about starting the job search again in a few months, but I am quite discouraged with my current experience and starting to notice signs of burnout.",

Today, it's been almost 8 months since I started applying (even before I graduated), but without success. During my internship as a data scientist in the retail sector, I found myself doing some \"data engineering\" tasks like working a lot on the cloud (GCP) and doing a lot of SQL in Bigquery, I know it's not much compared to what a real data engineer does on his daily tasks, but it was a new thing for me and I enjoyed doing it. At the end of my internship, I learned that unlike internships in the US, where it's considered a trial period to get hired, here in France it's considered more like a way to get some work done for cheap... well, especially in big companies. I understand that it's not always like that, but that's what I've noticed from many students.\n\nAnyway, during those few months after the internship, I started learning tools like Spark, AWS, and some of Airflow. I'm thinking that maybe I have a better chance to get a job in data engineering, because a lot of people say that it's getting harder and harder to find a job as a data scientist, especially for juniors. So is this a good idea for me? Because it's been like 3-4 months applying for Data Engineering jobs, still nothing. If so, is there more I need to learn? Or should I stick to Data Science profil, and look in other places, like Germany for example?\n\nSorry for making this post long, but I wanted to give the big picture first.",

If I add a partitionColumn and several partitions, Spark can spread the data pull out over several nodes, but it opens a whole bunch of concurrent connections to the DB.  For obvious reasons I don't want to do something like open 20 concurrent connections to a production database.  I already bumped up the number of concurrent connections to 12 and some nodes are still running out of memory, probably because the data is not evenly distributed by the partition column.\n\nI also ran into cases where the Spark job would pull all the partitions from the same executor, which makes no sense.  This JDBC datasource thing seems severely limited unless I'm overlooking something.  Are there any Spark users who do this regularly and have tips?

The data load is incremental.\n\nWhile in theory dimensional modeling ( star schemas to be exact ) is not hard, I am finding a hard time implementing the actual model.\n\nI want to know how are these dimensional modeling concepts are actually implemented, the following is  my thoughts about how I understand some theoretical concepts and the way I find gaps between them and the actual practice.\n\n**Avoiding duplicates in both fact and dimension tables** –does this happen in the Spark job or Redshift itself? \n\nI feel like for transactional fact tables it is not a problem, but for dimensions, it is not straight forward: you need to insure uniqueness of entries for all the table not just the chunk you loaded during this run and this raises the above question, whether it is done in Spark, and in this case we will need to somehow load the dimension table  in dataframes so that we can filter new data loads, or in redshidt, and in this case we just load everything new to Redshift and delegate upserts and duplication checks to Redshift.\n\n  \nAnd speaking of uniqueness of entries in dimension tables ( I know it is getting long, bear with me, we are almost there xD) , we have to also allow exceptions, because when dealing with **SCD type 2,** we must allow duplicate entries and update the old ones to be depricated, so again how is this exception implemented practically? \n\n**Surrogate keys** – Generate in Spark (eg. UUIDs/hashes?) or rely on Redshift `IDENTITY` for example?\n\nSurrogate keys are going to serve as primary keys for both our fact and dimension tables, so they have to be unique, again do we generate them in Spark then load to, Redshift or do we just make Redshift handle these for us and not worry about uniqueness? \n\n**Fact-dim integrity** – Resolve FKs in Spark or after loading to Redshift?\n\nAnother concern arises when talking about surrogate keys, each fact table has to point to its dimensions with FKs, which in reality will be the surrogate keys of the dimensions, so these columns need to be filled with the right values, I am wondering whether this is done in Spark, and in this case we will have to again load the dimensions from Redshift in Spark dataframes and extract the right values of FKs, or can this be done in Reshift????\n\nIf you have any thoughts or insights please feel free to share them, litterally anything can help at this point xD",

        "author": "Comfortable_Onion318",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone, \n\nwe are a company that relies heavy on a so called no-code middleware that combines many different aspects of typical data engineering stuff into one big platform. However we have found ourselves (finally) in the situation that we need to migrate to a lets say more fundamental tech stack that relies more on knowledge about programming, databases and sql. I wanted to ask if someone has been in the same situation and what their experiences have been. Our only option right now is to migrate for business reasons and it will happen, the only question is what we are going to use and how we will use it. \n\n**Background:**  \nWe use this platform as our main \"engine\" or tool to map various business proccess. The platform includes creation and management of various kinds of \"connectors\" including Http, as2, mail, x400 and whatnot. You can then create profiles that can get fetch and transform data based on what comes in by one of the connectors and load the data directly into your database, create files or do whatever the business logic requires. The platform provides a comprehensive amount of logging and administration. In my honest opinion, that is quite a lot that this tool can offer. Does anyone know any kind of other tool that can do the same? I heard about Apache Airflow or Apache Nifi but only on the surface. \n\nThe same platform we are using right now has another software solution for building database entities on top of its own database structure to create \"input masks\" for users to create, change or read data and also apply business logic. We use this tool to provide whole platforms and even \"build\" basic websites. \n\nWhat would be the best tech stack to migrate to if your goal was to cover all of the above? I mean there probably is not an all in one solution but that is not what we are looking for right now. If you said to me that for example apache nifi in combination with python would be enough to cover everything our middleware provided would be more than enough for me.  \n  \nWhat is essential for us is also a good logging capability. We need to make sure that whatever data flows are happening or have happended is comprehensible in case of errors or questions. \n\nFor input masks and simple web platforms we are currently using C# Blazor and have multiple projects that are working very well, which we could also migrate to.

This is often justified vaguely as a \"security measure.\" But what is the *actual security threat* being mitigated by hiding the key from the legitimate, authenticated owner?\n\nIf an attacker gains access to the dashboard, they can revoke or generate new keys anyway—so not showing the old key doesn't protect you from a compromised account. And if the account isn’t compromised, why can’t the rightful owner see the key again?\n\nMoreover, some major platforms like Google still allow users to view and copy API keys multiple times. So clearly, it's *not* an industry-wide best practice.\n\nIs this practice really about security, or is it just risk management and legal liability mitigation?  \nIf hiding the key is purely to protect from insiders or accidental leaks, isn't that a weak argument—especially considering that most providers let you revoke/regenerate keys at will?\n\nSo what *real* security benefit does hiding an API key from its owner provide—if any? Or is this just theater?\n\nEdit 1 -----------------\n\n**Please also address this point in your responses:**\n\nIf this is truly a security issue, then why does a company like **Google** — certainly not a small or inexperienced player — allow the **API key for its Gemini product** (used by millions of people) to be displayed openly and copied multiple times in **Google AI Studio**?\n\nThis is not some niche tool with a limited user base, nor is Google unfamiliar with security best practices. It's hard to believe that a company of Google's scale and expertise would make such a fundamental mistake — especially on a product as widely used and high-profile as Gemini.\n\nIf showing the API key multiple times were truly a critical security flaw, it’s reasonable to assume Google would have addressed it.

Especially considering nobody understands data structure, SQL, or anything outside basic Excel.\n\nI immediately got thrown in and asked to redesign various pages, tie into APIs, etc. I just scratched the surface of arrow functions, so this was daunting. Still, I have been making progress and doing okay. I just feel like I have large gaps in my knowledge. There's no ticket system here, no tracking. The only gauge on progress is 1v1 meetings with my boss.\n\nMy boss and director don't understand JS. My team does not either. I'm seriously on my own and rely on research and my own grit to make it through. I haven't made any major mistakes, but that's only because I don't know if I have. There's nobody to bounce ideas off of or rely on if I'm on PTO. I don't understand the distinction between the test and prod environment at a deeper level. Sometimes I can update pages on prod through test, and sometimes I can't. There's so many out of date files and I have no clue what bloat we have, or any sort of vulnerabilities we may have in our code.\n\nWith all that being said: I love my job, and I'm actually having a lot of fun within JS. I'm not complaining and am so very grateful that I have a position to apply things I know/learning. I'm learning a lot, I am still being encouraged, my team members have hearts of gold, but it's obvious I am the only one with technical experience here. However, if I moved to a more technical company, I think people would be able to see right through my gaps in knowledge. Just wondering if anyone has been in a similar boat?",

They are used as a place for the users to address and discuss more about the question, since the answers have to be used more to directly answer the question.\n\nWhen you see a StackOverflow question, instead of simply going for the top-rated answer and closing the page, also take a look at the comments, people generally discuss more intrinsically about the proposed solution, like more why it works, the possible drawbacks, etc. The comments may even have a better solution for cases where, for example, the answer is out of date. These discussions generally lead to you having a better understanding of the technology, concepts, language or whatever it is you are looking for.\n\nAnd you can also make questions in the comments! IMO, the comments are the place for the \"simpler\" questions people generally say are pushed back in StackOverflow, as there is generally no pressure to make good and structured questions.\n\nAlso, a bit out of the topic here, but please also take a look at the answers other than the accepted or top-rated ones, they could bring solutions that are more up to date or fit better your scenario.\n\n\nTLDR: StackOverflow comments provides many insights about the questions and answers, being a great place to look for discussions and learn more about the resource, also for asking \"simpler\" questions (also look at answers other than the accepted or top-rated ones).",

For context, I have 2 years of work experience, meaning I'm a junior dev:\n\n## Don't learn many languages\n\"Jack of all trades\" only applies at the mid-senior level. In junior->mid level, you should pick one language and framework and stick with it! Even if you want to do full-stack (React + Backend) you should pick a focus between the two. \nIt's rare for a company to want a split 50/50 between them, and the ones biased towards front-end will also favor UI/UX work (figma designs, etc.)\n\n## Build many projects\nBuild, build, build. Don't be like me stuck in a perpetual cycle of tutorial hell, where you value finishing guided tutorials more than actually working on your own projects. Yes, those projects can (with a lot of luck) still get you an interview, but the interviewers will figure out if you really built your own stuff and researched beyond the surface or not.\n\n## Don't use AI (too early)\nLLM editors are great to generate boilerplate, but until you get the hang of it and really, REALLY intentionally understand what the boilerplate is doing (and why it's needed) type everything by memory, and fallback to a reference (docs, Google) when you really struggle to recall something.\nPeople will hate this one, because they'll tell you \"memorization is not the point\" and it's not. The goal is to understand the intention behind everything. Learn the language and framework of your choice more than what every junior Joe and Gary know. It's ultra-competitive right now. Do you really want to blow your chances and lose it all because you went \"meh, I'll let cursor tell me which services and repositories to make, with the basic expected CRUD interfaces\". \nA good rule of thumb is to do that after you know 80%+ of what Cursor is about to generate.\n\n## Keyword Match everything\nOnce upon a time, people treated the keywords in the job opening as wish lists, and told you to \"apply anyways\". In this job market, companies can get whatever they want to get. While it's impossible to cover every base, it's important to consider which languages, frameworks and cloud services are popular along your choice, for your local job market.\n\nThat's it.

Move forward.\n\n# My Experience: A Cautionary Tale\n\nOver the past four years, I’ve been stuck in tutorial hell—watching endless courses, getting certifications, but never landing a full-time job. Here's how it happened:\n\n## Year 1: The Beginning\n\nStarted with web development and cloud computing when the tech was booming in Corona-era.\n\nFailed to build anything real.\n\nTutorials promised jobs after 10+ hour videos.\n\nI believed it.\n\n\n## Year 2-3: Network Engineering Phase\n\nShifted to networking, got AWS and CCNA certified.\n\nThought certifications would help.\n\nBy then, COVID-era remote jobs were fading, and competition was up.\n\n\n## The Harsh Reality\n\nTutorials didn’t match interview expectations.\nI was unprepared.\n\nThought the solution was more tutorials. So I watched more.\n\nBuilt cloned projects that everyone else built—companies don’t care.\n\nSwitched to documentation hoping it would help.\n\nJust a different type of loop. Still lost.\n\n\n# Why Tutorials Failed Me\n\nThey never teach real-world problem solving.\n\nThey sell dreams—“complete this and you’ll earn $100k.”\n\nInterviews now demand experience, originality, not tutorial projects.\n\nI had no mentor, no guidance, just trial and error.\n\n\n# The India-Specific Struggle\n\nNo CS degree, not from a reputed college.\n\nMost companies don’t care about certificates.\n\nRemote junior roles are disappearing.\n\nRejections everywhere—even for entry-level onsite jobs.\n\n\n# What I’m Doing Now\n\nShifting focus to:\n\nDSA preparation\n\nOpen-source contributions\n\nBuilding real-world projects (from scratch, with real problems)\n\n\n# No more copy-paste projects.\n\nInterviews are my new tutorial—every failure teaches something.\n\nStill applying. Still trying. Still learning.\n\n\n# Final Words\n\nIf you're stuck in tutorial hell, get out now.\nStart building. Start failing. Start learning for real.\nAnd if someday, we both succeed—let’s meet for a cup of coffee and talk about how far we’ve come.",

And this semester, I'm honestly not liking it at all, especially because I've been getting really bad grades this semester. I've thought about switching to mechanical engineering since it seems like a broader field, but I'm worried it might not be in demand because of Al and automation. On the other hand, I also wonder if I should just stick with software engineering and pursue a master's in Al to future-proof my career, given how rapidly that field is growing. I guess I'm just torn between these two paths and unsure if software engineering is really the right fit for me long term.",

Having to compile a program and using Makefiles seems like a better introduction to build systems and why we have them than the Python interpreter which just runs your code. \n\nAlso from what I've seen from other people, its much harder to move from python to C than the other way around.

Currently a few weeks into a software engineering program and find myself going through so many emotions every day; however, what a fun task it is to create something.\n\nAs a career salesman and ops manager, I was never afforded the opportunity to create and was always just pushing others products. For the first time in my life, I am having to exercise a part of my brain to utilize creativity to not only build the model of what I want to create but also to problem solve as that is what great engineers do.\n\n  \nIt is fascinating to me to see how people are viewing AI as either a godsend or a hinderance to their progress.  I guess I see it from both sides and also realized that which one it was ultimately came down to how I used the technology. Whether we are talking about ChatGPT, Co-Pilot, cursor ide, etc. these AI's are doing exactly what we are asking it to do. \n\nIf you do not like the technology; are you giving it limitations like \"only provide me a hint or clue\" to the method or function that isn't working or do you let it return fixed code. I always give my queries very strict logic so I do not deprive myself from the experience of learning. This is just as true when working with mentors, we must make sure to set clear boundaries so our partners can encourage and get the best out of us without spoon-feeding us data. \n\nLook forward to participating and learning with you.

But since I'm a total beginner when it comes to learning how to program, I'm not quite sure where or how to begin.\n\nI've checked out websites like CodeAcademy and FreeCodeCamp. They're great in terms of explaining concepts, almost like dictionaries, but I find it hard tot transition from theory to actually building and applying what I've learned. That's where I feel stuck. \n\nWhat I'm not saying is that CodeAcademy, FreeCodeCamp and such websites are bad. It's just that because of my lack of knowledge and experience that I don't know where to begin. It could even be that after all recommendations I would apply for CodeAcademy or FCC even, its just that I don't know yet.\n\nIdeally I'm looking for a learning platform that balances **teaching core concepts** (like how API's work, how to build them) **with hands-on projects** so I can apply what I'm learning as I go. I'm willing to pay- my budget is up to 40 dollars a month, but I also want to make sure that I'm choosing a platform that helps me build confidence and skills gradually, not just throw everything at me at once.\n\nLuckily my job gives me time during working hours to invest in this learning journey, so I'd love to make the most of it. Do you have any recommendations for platforms or paths to follow that could help me?\n\nThank you.",

For instance, if I'm calculating the location of an object to appear on screen, it doesn't really matter if I'm off by .000005, because that location will resolve to one pixel or another. Is there some process for telling hardware, \"stop after reaching x precision\"? It seems like it could save a significant chunk of computing time.\n\nI imagine that thrown out precision will accumulate over time, but if you know the variable won't be around too long, it might not matter. Is this something compilers (or whatever) have already figured out, or is this way of saving time so specific that it has to be implemented at the application level?",

It happens when you live in Italy, and you are blocked outside of metropolitan zone, but well it is shit you don't really interested...   \n  \nDeveloping is a good choice, I know many languages, developing bases (you know, base algorithms, Object Oriented Paradigm, and all stuff), and IT fundamentals (IT networking, web, AI bases and so on).  \nSome past experience in some languages, but i never put myself into a correct routine to become able to produce something useful. \n\nIn the last months I've decided to invest some time to make a step over on my developing learning. Idea was to be able enough to make some MVPs for my startup projects. \n\nNow the question: I'm start with Ruby/Rails, for convenience: basic knowledge of language, monolith structure that is useful when you are building prototypes, some magic for a quick write and go.  \nBut Ruby is not an used language. If i look on Linkedin, there are near to zero opportunities for rubyists and less than zero network potentiality. I suppose that I will never find another developer in 200Km range around me, for some collaboration if I need. So I ask myself if I should invest to change perspective and go on other routes: javascript (gods, I Hate javascript), PHP ( feels old), Phyton (the swiss knife of programming, but the diffusion around me is not so different than Ruby), or.. well... or?\n\n",

He's a smart kid who is good at implementing algorithms, but I've seen him lacking in computer science basics. Our team deals a lot in networking (we work in video streaming stack), few days ago I was explaining him about something and used terms such as NACK, FEC, etc. And he was completely oblivious to all this, he even said that these things are not part of his curriculum (he's a computer science engineering grad kid from a reputed university, and I believe he did not focus on these much during college). When I talked to him more, he said that he and his peers mostly focus on DSA as that's what gets them the job (he's purple on codeforces).\n\nIt seems there's this belief among college kids that DSA is enough for any fresher. Some might say that my team's scenario is different coz we deal with networking, but I think no matter what domain you pick, CS basics are a must. Let's say you are a backend web dev, then database basics are a must (not SQL, but basic concepts of database). I'd be a big career boost to have basics of OS, networking, DBMS and Computer organization ready.",

Since I’m the only \"somehow-web-oriented\" person in the office (meaning I’ve completed Linux From Scratch before and have some JavaScript codebases), they asked me to build it.\n\nI spent almost three weeks on this task—learning Litestar and Vue from scratch (mostly copy-pasting from the documentation), discovering new requirements along the way (e.g., setting up a database for storage, implementing a worker queue for long-running tasks), and eventually getting the demo functional.\n\nWhile I learned a lot during the process, I’m uneasy about the gaps in my implementation. For example:\n\n* Some of my APIs return a Response object, while others return plain dict objects. This inconsistency feels extremely wrong.\n* I still don’t know how to implement a secure authentication system—a task that will likely fall to me soon.\n* To simulate real-time updates, I’m currently polling an API twice per second. This is clearly suboptimal.\n\nThis brings me to my question: Are there bootstrap web development guides tailored for experienced programmers? Specifically, resources that cover foundational concepts every web developer knows but might be unfamiliar to developers in other domains?",

I walked away from it like it never happened.\n\nLater, I picked up C++ thinking I’d stick with it this time. And the same thing happened again.\n\nThe thing is, I genuinely love programming. I even have some ideas I believe would be awesome if I could bring them to life. But for some reason, every time I start learning, I eventually lose the passion and motivation to keep going.\n\nI’m not sure how to overcome this. Has anyone else gone through this kind of cycle?

        "author": "BenjaminFinestone",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm trying to think from a first principles perspective about what a non-binary program is in a computer, before it is compiled into machine code. I may type, say, Javascript, or Dart, and I see text like \"let varName = \"example\" \". But, if a computer is made out of 1's and 0's in electrical logic gate representations, is not this text being displayed to me already 1's and 0's? The question being, what is a non-binary language in a computer \\*before\\* a compiler? When I type an English-esq programming language, and I have the visual illusion of this tool writing in an easy plain language, like Python or JS, etc, what is that text that I am reading before it gets compiled? What is that in a computer? How is that different from the end binary of a compiler? What does a compiler do? \n\nQuestion put from idea into time: when I finish writing a program in an easy to read programming language (I.E., not binary), and then I enter a command into a terminal line to run a compiler to compile it, and then it compiles it, and run it, what is the object inside the computer across this timeline, and how is it changing across this process? What is the easy to read programming language before and after compilation inside the computer?\n\nThis question has grown out of a confusion about setting up a developer environment, with command lines and language-specific SDK's, and I am just trying to understand the developer environment, and what it is I am doing when I set up things like a Dart SDK for Flutter. Windows as a developer environment confuses me, because I don't have a framework of understanding of how all these downloadable packages have an organization schema with Windows in Windows Powershell. I am starting to look into Linux, with an integrated terminal; it seems much more organized to me. When I run a command on windows, and I am not sure about all this package stuff (I am a n00b learning), and Windows doesn't recognize it, I'm not sure what various different things are or aren't, because I don't have paradigms or conceptual frameworks to organize this. Clueless and lost. \n\n  \nTl;dr I tried to get Dart to run a basic \"Hello World!\" program, because I want to make an app with Flutter, but VS Code terminal wouldn't understand it, because I did not set up the developer environment correctly with the SDK. Now I've realized I don't understand a local developer environment, and I am taking a step back to understand CLI, terminals, and understanding the general organization of these things in a computer and what it even means to execute a CLI command, and for an operating system like Windows (in this case, Windows Powershell) to recognize new commands from new SDK packages and how it even locates/registers stuff like that in the computer (and thus also understand why it wouldn't be registering commands during failed attempts to use all this stuff). \\*I don't understand local developer environments.\\*",

        "content": "I'm honestly amazed this even needs to be said but if you're currently in a stable, low-drama, job especially outside of FAANG, just stay put because the grass that looks greener right now might actually be hiding a sinkhole\n\nLet me tell you about my buddy. Until a few months ago, he had a job as a software engineer at an insurance company. The benefits were fantastic.. he would work 10-20 hours a week at most, work was very chill and relaxing. His coworkers and management were nice and welcoming, and the company was very stable and recession proof. He also only had to go into the office once a week. He had time to go to the gym, spend time with family, and even work on side projects if he felt like it\n\nBut then he got tempted by the FAANG name and the idea of a shiny new title and what looked like better pay and more exciting projects, so he made the jump, thinking he was leveling up, thinking he was finally joining the big leagues\n\nFrom day one it was a completely different world, the job was fully on-site so he was back to commuting every day, the hours were brutal, and even though nobody said it out loud there was a very clear expectation to be constantly online, constantly responsive, and always pushing for more\n\nHe went from having quiet mornings and freedom to structure his day to 8 a.m. standups, nonstop back-to-back meetings, toxic coworkers who acted like they were in some competition for who could look the busiest, and managers who micromanaged every last detail while pretending to be laid-back\n\nHe was putting in 50 to 60 hours a week just trying to stay afloat and it was draining the life out of him, but he kept telling himself it was worth it for the resume boost and the name recognition and then just three months in, he got the layoff email\n\nNo warning, no internal transfer, no fallback plan, just a cold goodbye and a severance package, and now he’s sitting at home unemployed in a terrible market, completely burned out, regretting ever leaving that insurance job where people actually treated each other like human beings\n\nAnd the worst part is I watched him change during those months, it was like the light in him dimmed a little every week, he started looking tired all the time, less present, shorter on the phone, always distracted, talking about how he felt like he was constantly behind, constantly proving himself to people who didn’t even know his name\n\nHe used to be one of the most relaxed, easygoing guys I knew, always down for a beer or a pickup game or just to chill and talk about life, but during those months it felt like he aged five years, and when he finally called me after the layoff it wasn’t just that he lost the job, it was like he’d lost a piece of himself in the process\n\nTo make it worse, his old role was already filled, and it’s not like you can just snap your fingers and go back, that bridge is gone, and now he’s in this weird limbo where he’s applying like crazy but everything is frozen or competitive or worse, fake listings meant to fish for resumes\n\nI’ve seen this happen to more than one person lately and I’m telling you, if you’re in a solid job right now with decent pay, decent hours, and a company that isn’t on fire, you don’t need to chase the dream of some big tech title especially not in a market like this\n\nRight now, surviving and keeping your sanity is the real win, and that “boring” job might be the safest bet you’ve got\n\nBe careful out there",

I lost count of the amount of applications and interviews total. I was always just a bit short on aligning perfectly with their stack, a year too short on a certain technology, wrong cloud platform, etc. I got a part-time job, lived frugally, stretched my emergency savings / severance and told myself that the next one would surely be the one. I was so close, third time must be the charm or fourth or fifth, etc. \n\nI hid my unemployment from my family out of shame for 2 years. Then when April came around I was staring down the barrel of my 2 year mark of employment with nothing left in my savings. I confessed to my father with humility and asked for help. I am now starting as a Systems Engineer at a family friend's company next month after 2 rounds of interviews. I didn't even have to solve algorithms or draw up system designs. I am a bit ashamed of taking advantage of nepotism. I didn't see a light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I was exhausted and saw a lifeline being thrown and took it. I guess I am sharing this on a throwaway just to confess and in case others would find my story interesting.\n\n\nEdit: To answer some comments\n\n- This is very much a nepo hire, not networking. The family friend is the CTO.\n- I did reach out to my network just not to my father because I didn't want to worry or disappoint my parents.\n- Yes it was a mistake to wait so long, I just always felt like the next one would be the one.",

        "author": "ThrowRADisgruntledF",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This is more of a vent but I had an absolutely ridiculous candidate screening experience. The funny thing is, it started off really well! I have 8 YOE and this was for a senior level position. The screener and I were vibing, I was nailing the technical questions. Then it was time for the coding challenge: screener emailed instructions, said I’d have 20 mins, and promised to give me a 10 min warning and a warning before time was up. This was literally the easiest coding challenge I've ever seen in a candidate screening. I shared my screen, clarified instructions before starting, and was ready to go.\n\nRight then, the screener's mic died. We spent about 5 mins troubleshooting, he left/rejoined, I left/rejoined, he even got new AirPods. Finally, audio fixed, I started the challenge.\n\nI created a folder and three files via command line, pasted some boilerplate HTML/CSS, did a quick google search (allowed per instructions) and found my answer immediately, right then I'm told there's 10 mins left. I briefly thought \"there is no way that took 10 mins\" but moved on. I finished the minimum requirements shortly after, confirmed out loud it met the spec and that I was effectively done. He hadn't indicated time running out, so I asked if I should adjust CSS to make the output more visible, he said \"sure,\" so I did. Still hadn’t announced time, so I ask “do you want me to keep going?” he shrugs lol. Eventually, I asked explicitly if there were edge cases or another part to the coding challenge bc he was making no verbal indications of anything, he said no and asked me to email my code.\n\nI'm super stoked because I know I just nailed that challenge, until he abruptly says he's ending the screening early because I went THREE MINUTES OVER and asks if I have any questions. So I asked if I’d missed a requirement, how long candidates are expected to take (the full 20 mins), if I missed an edge case, etc. Nothing was amiss. So why? Because I went ***three*** minutes over and he didn’t think I would be able to complete the virtual onsite (the next round) in time lmao.\n\nAfter the call (feeling completely demoralized by the cold ending), I checked the timestamps of when he sent the instructions and when I emailed my code. Only 21 mins in between each email, meaning I didn't actually go over, he likely started the timer early due to HIS mic issues. So I sent a polite, non accusatory follow up email letting him know this because he may have not realized and cc’ed the recruiter. No response, I was ghosted.\n\nI get that companies owe candidates nothing, but asking for 40+ hours upfront for a take home project (I did not spend 40 hours on mine, and I also will never do one again bc of this experience) then rejecting over something so trivial is absurd. Even if I had gone over, I aced that screening. I double checked my work after, sent it to ChatGPT, it was solid. Also, again, literally the easiest challenge I’ve ever done and pretty insulting to be told I failed it.\n\nI probably dodged a bullet, but still needed to vent. Has anyone else experienced a completely bullshit screening like this?\n\n",

        "author": "The-_Captain",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "**tldr;** my 2¢ on how to think about AI with respect to job security - own projects, not tasks\n\n**Background:** I'm a senior software engineer with 7 years of experience, including fintech, big tech, and early-stage startups. I'm currently bootstrapping a lifestyle-sized small software product for SMBs. \n\n**Point of this post:** I'm giving my two cents about how to think of your career in software and whether it is at risk from AI.\n\n**Part 1: the hierarchy of employment**\n\nI think of all jobs, including in software, as falling into three categories:\n\n1. Task-oriented: your day-to-day revolves around completing tasks assigned to you. If you're working at a cafe, that might mean \"clean the tables\" or \"make coffee.\" If you're a SWE, that might mean \"change the button color palette from blues to purples according to the design system.\" Being good at this means you're known for clearing Jira queues quickly and nobody has to clean up after you or redo work you said you did.\n2. Project-oriented: you're given projects to complete but the details and methods are up to you. If you're working at a cafe, it could be \"make sure the pastries are refreshed every two hours.\" If you're a software engineer, it could be \"implement the new design system.\" Being good at this means you can be trusted to deliver a feature that may have multiple ways of completing it while balancing trade-offs, on time. This often requires delegation. I'm at this level right now.\n3. Outcome-oriented: you own an outcome. That's often quantified in terms of money or a money-adjacent metric. If you're at a cafe, it can be increasing the number of baked goods sold with coffee orders. If you're in software (you may not be actively coding at this level), it may be \"increase conversions from large enterprise clients on the landing page.\" Being good at this means being known as someone who can make products grow revenue and/or profit. I'm upgrading to this level by bootstrapping a business - even if I fail, I will have owned an outcome.\n\nIn both coffee and software examples, notice that these are different roles on the same project. Notice also that I focus on \"being known as,\" which is the most important thing in career stability and progression.\n\nAlmost everyone typically starts on level 1. It's unusual and incredibly risky to stay at level 1, and you have to be constantly adapting and learning new technologies to pull it off. You want to graduate to level 2 as soon as possible**,** ideally within 2 years. Few people make it to level 3, it's normally OK to stay at level 2. Level 2 makes more than level 1 within the same company/skillset (of course a PM at Walmart might make less than an AI engineer at OpenAI). Level 3 has unbounded pay. \n\n**How to move levels**\n\nI am by no means a great authority on getting promoted, I tend to get distracted and chase my own goals. But from talking to people who are good at it, there are two things you need to do:\n\n1. Be really good at your current job band: if you're level 1, your manager knows that when they give you a task, it will be done when you say it will be done, it will be done to the highest reasonable standards, and nobody is going to have to clean up after you.\n2. Know your manager's goals and align your work to them. Find ways to make them look better and achieve their goals. Show you care.\n\nOf course, there are more cynical factors, like being liked and having a good attitude. Finally, your self-conception is important. If you think of yourself as \"a guy who makes Spring Boot apps\" you'll be stuck in level 1 longer than if you think of yourself as \"a guy who delivers backend services.\" PG has a great essay about keeping your self-characterization loose but I can't find it right now.\n\n  \n**Part 2: What AI means for you**\n\nAI is decently good at doing a lot of level 1 work. If you counted on being the gatekeeper of button colors as the reason for why you can't be fired, that's not going to work anymore. In fact, if you counted on being the gatekeeper of anything, that's unlikely to keep working. \n\nThat being said, level 1 is always risky. If you were a really good JQuery developer who could complete any task in that language, the rise of frameworks like React threatened your job. Not right away as your company might need you for their existing code, but the reduced demand for JQuery devs would lessen your bargaining power and the increased support and flood of React developers would make switching stacks increasingly attractive to your employer. Any major technology shift is a threat to level 1 operators.\n\nThe difference with AI, however, is that it's happening across all technologies at once. The goal is what's being automated, not just the method. AI can write basic software in any language. You can't switch from owning button colors in JQuery to owning button colors in React or whatever the next tech is, you have to upgrade what you can deliver.\n\nThere are tasks that AI can't do because it's not smart enough. If you're a staff engineer working on very complex problems you might be fine, but if you're part of the 90% that do various versions of the same thing that everyone else does, your job is at risk once the Devins of the world nail their product and user experience.\n\nThe good news is that it's also a resource that you can use:\n\n1. If you're currently task-oriented, use AI to be really good at completing tasks fast and well. Do this by focusing on the \"well.\" AI is already really fast compared to you, so don't try to go faster. Plan first, think what kind of testing you need, both automated and manual, and what the deployment story will look like\n2. Now that you know the hierarchy of employment, focus on graduating to the next band by understanding the context in which you're given tasks, talking to your lead, and making their project happen faster and better\n\n**Why AI is not a threat to bands 2 and 3**\n\nOwning a project requires taste. AI doesn't have taste yet, and I doubt it will develop it. The main difference between owning tasks and owning a project is thinking through tradeoffs, understanding how this project fits and what its goals are, and making a plan that aligns the tradeoffs with the goals. AI can be very helpful as an assistant in doing this, but it requires the person doing it to already know what the options are and what the goals are. This is not the case for basic feature development.\n\nLevel 3 is safe first because it's the decision makers who aren't going to fire themselves, and second because it requires even more intuition and experience than AI has access to. More importantly, it requires accountability, which is one of the main barriers to using AI.",

        "content": "I just need to rant because I have no one to talk to. Just two days ago, I found out from some of my co-workers that my startup might go under within a year or two. According to them, this was something the CTO himself said.\n\nFor a bit of background, I was hired a year ago, but I don’t work on the company’s main SaaS product. Instead, they acquired another software company, and I’m solely responsible for maintaining and fixing bugs in that software. I have three years of experience as a full-stack developer, and in this company, I’m the only one working on this project. I’ve learned a lot over the past year, but after hearing this news, I just feel awful and completely clueless about what to do.\n\nI wouldn’t mind as much if this were a remote job, but I actually moved across states to this city because it’s an in-office position. It’s hard to get interviews these days, and when I do get them, most interviewers expect me to be available during work hours, which is difficult since my company isn’t very flexible with time off. I used to work 10-hour days, but my health took a toll, and I was diagnosed with hypertension at just 25. I'm now on medication and had just started setting personal boundaries. I joined a gym, began eating healthy, and made it a point to arrive and leave work on time. Things were starting to look up — but hearing this news killed what little motivation I had left.\n\nI also deal with anxiety, and interviews are a nightmare for me. I tend to completely blank out to the point where I can’t even answer simple questions. I don't know how to divide my time to properly prepare, and I’m not sure how to present myself as a capable software engineer on my resume.\n\nRight now, I feel completely lost and broken. If anyone has any advice, I’d really appreciate it.   \n\n\nThank you so much for reading.",

I really think that I like coding, I loved all my CS classes, when working on labs and couldn't figure things out I'd take a break from the lab and would literally have the code running in the back of my mind until I figured out the solution. And getting the programs to run correctly was always so satisfying. In school we used Python and C so I am pretty proficient in those, and then recently ive taken a React.js course but not too into that yet, but I loved the whole concept of seeing my code work in real-time.\n\n  \nI am currently in a DevOps like role, working with Microsoft Azure supporting some products for a pretty huge company (but not a tech company). I really do not do much at my job, just like cloud optimization and monitoring, fixing some pipeline errors, etc. This is not interesting at all to me, I also feel like I will be getting let go soon because of lack of work and layoffs that have happened and probably will continue to happen. I use Python to automate some things at my job, using the Azure clients to access info and pull it out, and thats enjoyable, I work with ChatGPT for those because its really easy to bang out programs like that. I've expressed an interest in switching to SWE to my managers but it doesn't seem like there's much opportunity to because of offshoring and layoffs, and we are potentially moving away from building products in house. \n\n  \nI've been applying to SWE roles, Product Manager, Solution Architect/Engineer, and other roles, have applied to over 60 jobs now (all entry-level as I've only been at my job for 6-7 months) and I have not gotten a single interview. Not even a coding test, nothing. Everyday I wake up to a new rejection email. I feel stuck at my job where I don't do much, I want to work at a tech company where I can be working with new technology and innovation hands on but it just doesn't seem like I can even get a new job. I dont know maybe this is just a rant but appreciate whoever reads all that.",

I am fully remote, work maybe 15hours a week, our tech stack is incredibly outdated and code standards are non existent. My base/TC is $105k/$115k. I live a very comfortable life. I go surfing in the afternoons, have sleep overs with my girlfriend and work together the next day, can take trips whenever I want, have moved temporarily to a bunch of different cities etc.\n\nFor the last year or so i've craved a new role, challenge and life experience because frankly being alone most of my week and not having stimulating work has gotten to me. I wanted to move away from SWE and go into a PM role. Well lucky me, I finally got everything I was asking for but now i'm unsure. The new role is hybrid(3days) in Los Angeles and base/tc is $145k/$180-200k. The TC includes options that vest over 6 years with a cliff at 3 so realistically I will be locked in for three years if I took the offer. I will obviously be working more hours than I am used too and i'd have to move away from my gf, friends and beach. I currently live in a beach town in OC where I can surf in 5minutes, my gf is 10min away and my friends are 20min away. Based on my research, there is no good place I could move that would optimize the commute time between the three main locations. If I moved closer to LA but still in OC I would still be an hour away from LA and an hour away from my gf/friends. If I moved to LA I would be close to work but far from the beach, gf and friends. If I lived in LA, I realistically would only be able to surf on weekends because even on my remote days it would be an hour to beach and an hour or more back.\n\nSince I got my remote job, i've been living my life in a way that maximized my happiness and have had that mindset since. Like I said, lately i've wanted a change but now that the change is in front of me, it is frightening to me. What should I do?",

I want to know more such perspective. I call myself a full stack developer coz I can build databases using SQL, create RESTful apis and build the frontend using React. Another comment said that this building these doesnt classify as a full stack developer, and then i did my research and came to realisation all about pipelines, cloud computing and I realised I know so little.

Truthfully tried a few different careers before this one and am a bit burned out on grinding.\n\nMy ambitions are to go the software architect route or try and start my own software shop. I'm concerned I'm stagnating or writing garbage code that I'm unaware of it because the company is so small and the other dev takes full advantage of not being watched and checks out. I'm writing 90% of the code and I like it that way, but I am concerned abouth lack of PD and lack of career path at this company. I've been weighing asking for a promotion + 15% raise but don't know if that is tacky\n\nEDIT: I did some research, which I should have done. I appreciate the commentary and I have been reflecting on this. \n\n Glassdoor claims that the median total pay in LA Is 130K per year. I am unsure if that is correct. \n\nI suppose I am paid okay but not great for an average developer, and if I want to earn more, then I need to grind a bit and focus on higher paying jobs that will demand more, perhaps outside LA.

If those really are necessary, how can I work to move into those areas without having the professional experience?",

        "content": "Currently at 3.5 YOE at a FAANG living in Austin, and recently decided to look at other opportunities. This is my first time applying to jobs since I was in school, been an interesting experience overall and I’d love some thoughts on my situation\n\nCurrently making ~210k, on promo would expect ~260-270 but generally discontent at work and would like a change\n\nI’ve been fortunate with applications, I’m considering the following two offers:\n\nCoinbase:  ~235k TC, plus 25k sign-on\n\nStartup:\n- Utilities sector, 100 employees, founded in 2023\n- Just received 200 million in series B funding\n- 175k TC, about 40k of which is in equity \n- In office\n\nCoinbase pros:\n- Higher immediate comp, safer\n- Remote\n- Better WLB\n- I’ve been entertaining a move to a higher COL area, and Coinbase would adjust salary for that. Not positive I want to move yet, otherwise this would be the deciding factor\n\nStartup pros:\n- Higher potential payout\n- More exciting\n- Feel more valued by the company, more upward mobility \n- Great office vibe\n\nIf the startup hits series C, comp would pull slightly ahead of CB. Any further growth would expand that lead. I’ve done my research and feel good about the growth potential, but there’s always the risk it doesn’t pan out, especially with the current economic situation.\n\nOne reason I decided to look at other jobs was my company returning to office 5 days a week. The commute sucks and I’m not a fan of the office. So remote sounds nice. That said, the startup is walkable, and I actually loved the vibe during my visits for interviews.\n\nI do have to be honest, I don’t push myself as hard working remote, and I think working in an office would boost my output/career growth\n\nInitially, I was leaning heavily toward CB, but the startup has been persistent, and I feel very valued by them. I’ve had direct calls from both the CTO and CEO telling me what a great fit they thought I was for the position and how much they’d love to have me join. Fairly personal each time so it’s felt authentic. Guess I’m not immune to flattery, because feeling so appreciated has me doubting my decision.\n\nI’d expect crazy hours from the startup, they’ve been transparent about expectations and it seems working late nights and weekends is not uncommon. I don’t prefer that, but if I really enjoy the work I think I’d be ok with it.\n\nI’m not sure how much I’m romanticizing the “fulfilling work/make more of an impact” aspect of the startup. My only experience has been with a big tech company, and the idea of working on something new without all the corporate song and dance seems refreshing.\n\nUltimately it’s a personal decision, but I’m hoping for some insight from people who’ve gone down either path. Particularly curious to hear how skills develop in both environments, which is better for career development?",

        "content": "22F, asian. 4th semester of computer science. 3.15 gpa. I literally have a C in all coding/major subjects. \n\nI never wanted to attend this university and also picked my major at the last moment. \n\nThe only reason I went with CS is because I like and enjoy math and statistics and I wanted to study something math related. But CS is nothing like math or not atleast how I hoped it will be.\n\nThe thing is last two years have been bad bad bad for me mental health wise. I wish I had got help before starting university, that way things would have been really different. \n\nIt's not CS that made me suicidal, I was depressed and suicidal before I started uni and since I couldn't find the courage to go to therapy, things only worsened. I couldn't focus or study for the life of me. I felt really burnt out. I still do.\n\nFor an overachiever like me, seeing my grades fall only added to the stress and depression. \n\nI have learned shit nothing in these 2 years. I don't even remember what I studied. I only have an idea about how things work. But I am no where near a good coder. I mostly survived through gpt and common sense. \n\nAnyways, what is done is done. I realise how fucking late I am but I'm finally getting help. I'm in therapy and I want to improve.\n\nNow I have to clean up my mess and get my shit together. \n\nI seriously hate my current university and want to drop out the second I get readmission to a better one. Admission decisions are not out yet. \n\nI want to restart things real bad because I want to do everything right this time. Plus I'd be in a much better state of mind this time.\n\nBut my asian parents are not supportive of this. They believe I have already wasted enough time and can't restart now. They want me to continue at my current uni regardless of everything. \n\nMy gpa is really really bad compared to others who have 3.8 3.9 in my class. This makes me feel really insecure. Plus they have skills too and have already landed an intership. I feel like if I continue from here, I would never be able to catch up to the crowd or land any \"good\" job. \n\nThere's a part of me who believes I can survive cs if I put my heart and focus into it. And the other part believes I just suck, the reason why I flopped is not bc of my mental health but because I'm incompetent for CS. \n\nPeople in my class have been coding since age of 8/9 and I only started three years ago.  \n\nThis is pushing me to change career not just university. \n\nI have heard data science is more math and stat leaning which is why I'm thinking maybe I'd comparatively do better there. With a minor in mathematics on the side, I can try for quant or go for fashion tech. These two fields intrigue me the most. \n\nI reapplied to unis without telling my parents. Should I go ahead regardless of their disapproval? \n\nI know I am fucking 22 and should make decisions on my own but my self esteem is really really low. I don't have an ounce of confidence thanks to my gaslighting mother who made me internalise girls who don't listen to their parents end up suffering and regretting. She believes my depression is also a punishment for not listening to her and going to medical school. My parents terribly wanted me to become a doctor and there hasn't been a day where I have not thought, maybe they were right, I should have just pursued medicine. \n\n\n\n",

I'm definitely open to other ideas.\n\nSkills: I don't know what to invest in. I don't know what's in demand right now, let alone what will be in demand in the future. Part of me wants to invest in Java/Spring and give SWE another attempt, but that's a crazy idea.",

While I still plan on doing that, and with how quickly one year passed, I’m realizing that I’ll have to start planning on making the switch soon. \n\nContext:\n27 years old. \nLocal government. \nWork with Power Platform and/or .Net\nFully Remote. 45 minute commute if needed but rare. \nExcellent benefits for myself and family.  \nTeam and boss are great, org is too. Awesome WLB\n\nDownside: 66k salary. There is room for growth but it’s slow. Ex: A certification can get me a 3% raise, 6% max for the year, on top of average 4% yearly COL raise\n\nA senior could make 90k+ but there’s only one position available and they’re actively searching. \n\nWith what I’ve worked one over the past year, I still feel very fresh but I know I’m underpaid given the position. As much as I love the current workplace and its benefits, it would be a disservice to myself if I stayed here and didn’t go for more after everything it took to get here. \n\nI could give up the benefits, the PTO, for staying fully remote. That’s the one thing I don’t want to give up. \n\nSo the question stands: when, and how, would you make switch? \n",

        "content": "Derived from a previous post...\n\nAbout a year ago, I \"left\" (unfairly PIPed) a particular company after a decade of service, the last 6 of which being software engineering related. Despite the experience I accumulated, I am having trouble like many of you getting callbacks for SE roles. It has left me quite defeated. Moreover, though, it has me rethinking my whole career. Although I enjoyed aspects of my prior roles, the sheer amount of bureaucracy and networking one had to play is certainly one I have not missed. (Granted, what role DOESN'T have this?!?). I just don't seem to have the tenacity to do this anymore, and with the oncoming of AI to shake things up, I'm not sure I ever will.\n\nIn any case, does anyone have any suggestions for career alternatives? May or or may not related to computer science. In my down time, I have been serving as a part-time rural carrier. To be honest, it has been rather appealing due to its isolation and it's system based on seniority. However, using this as a branch to transfer into USPS software careers does not appear to be working, as it seems many others had the same idea.\n\nThe ultimate question is where to go from here. With experience, a BS in EE, and soon-to-be Master's in CS, one would think I should have easy time getting a job, but to no avail. I did debate the electrician path, but that could be another conversation in itself. I really am just looking at others' ideas.\n\nHopefully this provides enough context to get the ball rolling. If not, I could always update.",

The pay is good, there is not a lot of work and I spend most of my time doing open source contributions and making personal projects in the hopes of being hired at a foreign company so I can live in a developed country.\n\nI recently got an offer from a small startup of 15 people (5 of which were hired last month including a friend who referred me) with a 33% pay bump and chance to work on more enterprise project. I don't care about the money, I already make a good amount and 33% would not essentially make me happier.\n\nThe question is considering my goals of getting hired abroad, preferably at FAANG, should I take this offer and start working on actual projects or keep doing my personal projects and learning small new things everyday.\n\nI would have probably jumped if they also offered remote work, seems like I'm addicted and quite happy with remote work. I can go to the gym, sleep as much as I want and spend a lot more time with my family. But I think if this is a short term situation and whether or not I need to be working more in order to achieve my goals.\n\nPS. This is going to be a React + Python full-stack position.
