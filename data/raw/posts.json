Other than python, most of them (except for one exceptionally bad candidate) could talk the talk regarding tech stack, ELT vs ETL, tools like dbt, Glue, SQL Server, etc. but not a single one could actually write python.\n\nWhat's even more insane to me is that ALL of them rated themselves somewhere between 5-8 (yes, the most recent one said he's an 8) in their python skills. Then when we get to the live coding portion of the session, they literally cannot write a single line. I understand live coding is intimidating, but my goodness, surely you can write just ONE coherent line of code at an 8/10 skill level. I just do not understand why they are doing this - do they really think we're not gonna ask them to prove it when they rate themselves that highly?\n\nWhat is going on here??\n\n  \nedit: Alright I stand corrected - I guess a lot of yall don't use python for DE work.

Do data engineers remember all the steps and syntax needed to create Cloud SQL Instances or do they just reference documentation?\n2. Furthermore, do data engineers just memorize conceptual knowledge of SQL, Python, the terminal, etc. or do you memorize granular syntax and steps too?\n\nI assume that you just reference documentation because it seems like a lot of granular steps and syntax to memorize.

What I'm really looking for is a book or resource that teaches data engineering *by example* — something that walks through realistic use cases or projects, explaining not just the “how” but the *why* behind the decisions.\n\nThink something like:\n\n* ingesting and transforming data from a real-world dataset\n* designing a slowly changing dimension pipeline\n* setting up an end-to-end feature store\n* building a streaming pipeline with windowing logic\n* deploying ML models with batch or real-time scoring in mind\n\nDoes such a book or resource exist?

Right now I believe that I've never been so productive because I actually see my deliverables as something \"solid\", something that no pretencious \"business guy\" will try to debate or outsmart me (with his 5min GPT research).\n\nUsually most of my DS routine envolved trying to convince the \"business guy\" that asked for me to deliver something, that my solutions was indeed correct despite of his opinion on that matter. Now I've found myself with tasks that is moving data from A to B, and once it's done theres no debate whether it is true or not, and I can feel myself relieved. \n\nPerhaps what I see in the future that could also give me a relatable feeling of \"solidity\" is MLE/MLOps. \n\nThis is just a shout out for those that are also tired, perhaps give it a chance for DE and try to see if it brings a piece of mind for you. I still work with DS, but now for my own pleasure and in university, where I believe that is the best environment for DS to properly employed in the point of view of the developer. ",

But the need — a simple, internal way to spin up data environments, turned out to be much more universal. Onyxia is now used by teams in Norway, at the UN, and in the US, among others.\n\nAt its core, Onyxia is a web app (packaged as a Helm chart) that lets users log in (via OIDC), choose from a service catalog, configure resources (CPU, GPU, Docker image, env vars, launch script…), and deploy to their own K8s namespace.\n\nHighlights:\n- Admin-defined service catalog using Helm charts + `values.schema.json` → Onyxia auto-generates dynamic UI forms.\n- Native S3 integration with web UI and token-based access. Files uploaded through the browser are instantly usable in services.\n- Vault-backed secrets injected into running containers as env vars.\n- One-click links for launching preconfigured setups (widely used for teaching or onboarding).\n- DuckDB-Wasm file viewer for exploring large parquet/csv/json files directly in-browser.\n- Full white label theming, colors, logos, layout, even injecting custom JS/CSS.\n\nThere’s a public instance at [datalab.sspcloud.fr](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr) for French students, teachers, and researchers, running on real compute (including H100 GPUs).\n\nIf your org is trying to build an internal alternative to Databricks or Workbench-style setups — without vendor lock-in, curious to hear your take.",

It’s a lot, likely because the interface wasn’t intended for this purpose. It’s what I’ve got though. It’s slow with lots of steps to potentially fail at. All that, and I can only filter at a days granularity—so polling for changes is a loaded process too.\n\nI went ahead and set up an ETL pipeline that used DuckDB as an intermediate caching layer, to avoid memory issues, and set it up to dump parquet into S3. This ran for 24 hours then failed just shy of the dump, so now I’m thinking about micro batches.\n\nI want to turn this into a microbatch process. I figure I can cache the ID, HATEAOS link, and a nullable column for the JSON data. Once I have the data, I update the row where it belongs. I could store duckdb in S3 the whole time, or just plan to dump it if a failure occurs. This also gives a way to query the duckdb for missing records in case it fails mid way.\n\nSo before I dump duckdb into S3, or even try to use duckdb in s3 over a network, are there limitations I’m not considering?

        "content": "Hey, i am new to this, sorry if noob question, doing project. Basically i have my source system as some relational database like PostgreSQL, goal is to stream changes to my tables in real time. I have setup Kafka Cluster and Debezium. This helps me to stream CDC in real time into my Kafka brokers to which i subscribe. Next part is to write those changes into my OLAP database. Here i wanted to use Spark Streaming as a Consumer to Kafka topics, but writing row by row into OLAP database is not efficient. I assume goal is to prevent writing each row every time, but to buffer it for bulk of rows to ingest. \n\nDoes my thought process make sense? How is this done in practice? Do i just say to SparkStreaming write to OLAP each 10 minutes as micro batches? Does this architecture make sense?",

        "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI’m tasked with grabbing data from one db about devices and using a rest api to pull information associated with it. The problem is that the api only allows inputting a single device at a time and I have 20k+ rows in the db table. The plan is to automate this using airflow as a daily job (probably 20-100 new rows per day). What would be the best way of doing this? For now I was going to resort to a for-loop but this doesn’t seem the most efficient.\n\nAdditionally, the api returns information about the device, and a list of sub devices that are children to the main device. The number of children is arbitrary, but they all have the same fields: the parent and children. I want to capture all the fields for each parent and child, so I was thinking of have a table in long format with an additional column called parent_id, which allows the children records to be self joined on their parent record. \n\n\nNote: each api call is around 500ms average, and no I cannot just join the table with the underlying api data source directly\n\nDoes my current approach seem valid? I am eager to learn if there are any tools that would work great in my situation or if there are any glaring flaws.\n\nThanks!\n",

We currently have a use case where we need to seek distinct values for some fields in thousands of files, which is quite slow when done directly on S3.\n\nMy manager and I were experimenting with Parquet files to achieve this. but I recently found out that Parquet files are immutable, so we can't update existing parquet files with new listings unless we load the whole file into memory. \n\n  \nEach listingId file is quite small (few Kbs), so it doesn't make sense for one parquet file to only contain info about a single listingId. \n\nI wanted to ask if someone has accomplished something like this before.

        "author": "bebmfec",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I have quite a complex SQL query within DBT which I have been tasked to build an API 'on top of'.\n\nMore specifically, I want to create an API that allows users to send input data (e.g., JSON with column values), and under the hood, it runs my dbt model using that input and returns the transformed output as defined by the model.\n\nFor example, suppose I have a dbt model called `my_model` (in reality the model is a lot more complex):\n\n    select \n        {{ macro_1(\"col_1\") }} as out_col_1,\n        {{ macro_2(\"col_1\", \"col_2\") }} as out_col_2\n    from \n        {{ ref('input_model_or_data') }}\n    \n\nNormally, `ref('input_model_or_data')` would resolve to another dbt model, but I’ve seen in dbt unit tests that you can inject synthetic data into that `ref()`, like this:\n\n    - name: test_my_model\n      model: my_model\n      given:\n        - input: ref('input_model_or_data')\n          rows:\n            - {col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1}\n      expect:\n        rows:\n          - {out_col_1: \"out_val_1\", out_col_2: \"out_val_2\"}\n    \n\nThis allows the test to override the input source. I’d like to do something similar via an API: the user sends input like `{col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1}` to an endpoint, and the API returns the output of the dbt model (e.g., `{out_col_1: \"out_val_1\", out_col_2: \"out_val_2\"}`), having used that input as the data behind `ref('input_model_or_data')`.\n\nWhat’s the recommended way to do something like this?",

That’s a problem but nothing I can change.\n\nRight now we keep things simple. We build ETL pipelines using Node.js/TypeScript since that’s our primary tech stack. Orchestration is handled with cron jobs running on several linux servers.\n\nWe have a new project coming up that will require us to build around 200–300 pipelines. They’re not too complex, but the volume is significant given what we run today. I don’t want to overengineer things but I think we’re reaching a point where we need orchestration with auto scaling. I also see benefits in introducing database/table layering with raw, structured, and ready-to-use data, going from ETL to ELT.\n\nI’m considering airflow on kubernetes, python pipelines, and layered postgres. Everything runs on-prem and we have a dedicated infra/devops team that manages kubernetes today.\n\nI try to keep things simple and avoid introducing new technology unless absolutely necessary, so I’d like some feedback on this direction.

I just realized how deep things like modern PHP (OOP, PDO, MVC) really go.\n\nI'm stuck in a loop:\n\n* I configure more than I code.\n* I jump stacks/tools as soon as I get frustrated.\n* I keep telling myself I’ll start earning once I “master” something — but that day never comes.\n\nI’ve built login forms, basic POS systems, and some admin panels with PHP/MySQL. But I don’t ship projects, or try freelancing because I feel like “it’s not good enough.”\n\nBefore tech, I worked jobs in hotels (cashier, counter helper), and I even did graphic design, video editing, 2D/3D animation. But I gave those up because I had a weak PC. Now I’ve got an i5 2nd gen with GTX 750 and 8GB RAM. It’s decent, but not great for creative work.\n\nI'm not asking for money or help. I’m just tired. I want to help my family financially, but I’m failing to pick one skill and stick with it.\n\nI love tech, but I’m also thinking of doing odd jobs again, just to survive. I feel like I’m wasting my best years watching tutorials and configuring my editor.\n\n**My questions to this community**:\n\n* Has anyone been through this kind of burnout or paralysis?\n* How do you stop jumping stacks/tools and just commit?\n* How do I finally start earning — even $100/month — to break this cycle?\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you. I’m posting this not to complain, but to hear from real people. This is my first time posting. Maybe I just want to feel seen by people who understand.",

I have decent enough problem solving skills but I take a long time and I struggle to comprehend math and numbers.\n\nCan I still be a good programmer? Is it something anyone can pick up, or does your brain have to work in a specific way?\n\nI’ve looked at the FAQ and done some research already, but I really want to hear your honest experience with programming and how accessible it is.\n \nThanks all :)\n\n\nEdit: Wow!!! Thank you so so much for the replies everyone. I am at work but I’m going to read through and respond later today. I didn’t expect nearly this much support, I appreciate you all.\n\nJust to add some more information- I have no experience yet. I just started taking a free online course and playing with scratch literally yesterday. I’ve always loved games but until now have been focusing on improving my creative abilities (art and writing) so that I can create a decent game, and now I think I’m finally at a good spot with that so I’m moving to the next step (programming). \n\nI am a very good reader, and can be good at problem solving, but I have fairly severe ADHD which makes it hard to keep track of things. I think it will be challenging, but it’s something I’m passionate about so I’m willing to put in the effort. Thank you all so much!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you so much everybody. I couldn’t respond to everyone without sounding repetitive, but I read through every comment and am so grateful to you all for taking the time to give me your opinions and advice. I think I may struggle in some areas more than others might, but I am so determined and excited to make this happen. You’re all amazing!! I appreciate you so much",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi all,  \nI recently created a fun cipher that encodes text using the digits of π. I thought it would be a cool way to explore string matching and character encoding in Python — and I'd love to get your thoughts or improvements!\n\n## How the cipher works:\n- Each character is converted to its ASCII value.\n- That number (as a string) is searched for in the digits of π (ignoring the decimal point).\n- The **starting index** of the first match and the **length** of the match are recorded.\n- Each character is encoded as `index-length`, separated by hyphens.\n\n### Example:\nThe ASCII value of `'A'` is `65`.  \nIf `65` first appears in π at index **7** (π = 3.141592653... → digits = 141592653...),  \nthen it's encoded as:\n```\n7-2\n```\n---\n\n## Here’s an encrypted message:\n```\n11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2\n```\n---\n\n## And here’s the Python code to decode it:\n```python\nfrom mpmath import mp\n\nmp.dps = 100005  # digits of π\npi_digits = str(mp.pi)[2:]\n\ncipher_text = (\n    \"11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2\"\n)\n\nsegments = cipher_text.strip().split(\"-\")\nindex_length_pairs = [\n    (int(segments[i]), int(segments[i + 1]))\n    for i in range(0, len(segments), 2)\n]\n\ndecoded_chars = []\nfor index, length in index_length_pairs:\n    ascii_digits = pi_digits[index - 1 : index - 1 + length]\n    decoded_chars.append(chr(int(ascii_digits)))\n\ndecoded_message = \"\".join(decoded_chars)\nprint(decoded_message)\n```\n---\n\n### Tutorial Flair\n\nThis post demonstrates how to decode a custom cipher based on the digits of π.  \nIt walks through reading the encoded index-length pairs, mapping them to ASCII values found in the digits of π, and reconstructing the original message using Python.\n\nFeel free to adapt the script to experiment with your own messages or tweak the ciphering method.

        "content": "I used to start a lot of web projects once I started learning frontend frameworks and now that I've actually been pushing for a while after giving up the first few times I realized what my main point of frustration was. \n\nRuntime errors. \n\nSo many times I couldn't 100% understand why something I am passing is not rendering and what the console errors mean, what is a type Object Object etc and since I got tired of starting and giving up I decided randomly to do a project with Typescript instead of JS and holy shit. \n\nAll type errors get underlined right away and just copy pasting to AI and asking for an explanation gets to understand things like when you're using a reference or comparing a reference instead of a value instead of learning about it once you set everything up. \n\nSo while it might be more work, what got me to truly enjoy writing web stuff is learning Typescript. If you know any typed language it is super quick to pick up, and if it's your first typed language you'll need a bit more time to get it but once you do you're not going back to vanilla JS. \n\nEveryone's journey is different, but if you feel you dig yourself in too easily when dealing with passing data around, try it!",

The founder would hire students from university or young adults to literally drag and drop folders into specific drives and put on various USB sticks. For 8hrs a day. Yes I said drag and drop.\n\nMost people would just put on YouTube on headphones and like zombies drag and drop all day. (Wish I was making this up). These resources were used to help students in exam preparation. \n\nIn the folders there where hundreds of different PDFs, PowerPoints, MCQ questions as well as thousands of csv files.\n\nShe was in a perpetually panic to do this for unclear reasons. I guess they powered her website and her entire business.\n\nAt the time I had no programming knowledge yet instinctively knew it could be done better. In my total ignorance I tried some some scripts in Javascript until she caught me and yelled at me to do my real job. Later I was let go for not being productive enough.\n\nI asked some nearby devs for help but they said they were too busy.\n\nToday I know an intern could have a Python script doing the main stuff inside a day with os.system, glob, a few for loops, csv libraries etc, pandas. Stick a chron job and it’s daily routine. \n\nEven better use Powershell / awk, see or grep.\n\nBetter yet move everything to the cloud.\n\nThe entire process could have automated inside a month when all edge cases where accounted for. \n\nThere were some devs on front end but I think they hated her so much they didn’t intervene or didn’t get paid enough to care. They all left very rapidly I don’t blame them for claiming ignorance. The owner / founder was a psychotic bint.\n\nOne time, a dev got validly angry about something unrelated about a development process and suddenly next week he was gone for \"operational reasons\".\n\nShe paid 10-15 people minimum wage to do this drag and dropping for 2-3 years to best of my knowledge. \n\nThey are somehow still in business.\nIt’s unbelievable how incompetent it was but that’s truth.",

I’ve been learning programming and I’m passionate about it but it frustrates me that I forget all the time so I had to study all over again or look through some notes or search. I’m afraid I won’t be able to do well in job. Hence, pass the interview because I can’t do well on the spot without taking too much time. If it’s not okay, I want to make it work. So, any advice for me? or someone having the same situation but succeed? ",

        "author": "Apprehensive-West119",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a junior fullstack developer with just under a year of experience. I work at a small software house that maintains and develops a few internal apps and services.\n\nLately, I’ve been feeling extremely frustrated with the direction my work has taken, and I’m not sure if I’m just being unrealistic or if this is genuinely a toxic environment. I’d love some outside perspective.\n\nWhen I started, I was trained in the company's main stack – NestJS (Node) and React – and I was excited to grow in that tech. But for the past few months, I’ve been doing tasks that have almost nothing to do with fullstack development:\n\n* Creating automations in low-code tools\n* Researching integrations with outdated platforms\n* Working in an 8-year-old PHP project (I had zero experience in PHP before)\n\nTo make it worse, the PHP project has no proper security practices (e.g., passwords stored in plaintext in the database), and my suggestions for refactoring or rewriting it in our actual stack have been ignored.\n\nI'm currently split across 3 different projects and constantly bombarded with tasks from all sides. Meetings eat up a lot of time, and I’m falling behind. There’s barely any code review or mentorship, and I feel like I’m not learning or growing in the direction I want.\n\nOn top of all that, I’m working for minimum wage in my country, which makes it even more discouraging -I’m putting in real effort but I feel like I’m getting very little in return, both in terms of compensation and career growth.\n\nI do have a backup plan (a non-IT job I could return to), but I’m hesitant to give up on development just yet. That said, the junior job market is rough, and I’m worried that if I leave now, I might end up searching for months before I find another dev position.\n\nSo I'm stuck in this limbo — should I just accept that this is how things are in smaller companies and try to push through? Or is this a sign that I should look for a better environment?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice from those who’ve been through something similar. Thanks in advance!",

I got halfway thought the tutor because i havent had much time recently.\n\nMy question is: Why would you want to use Vim and other terminal based editors (which might not be IDEs out of the box) when you could use something like Visual Studio (which is very popular) with something that lets you use vim motions, commands, macros and all of that good stuff that Vim has?  \nI'm sure that you can make your editor of choice work only with a keyboard, and customize it to your needs. Why use something like Vim then?",

Since that ended, I've been trying to get back into the practice as a hobby only to discover I am bored out of my goddamn mind. I've been trying to learn to make little games, but even trying to recreate Pong in Lua makes my eyes glaze over less than 50 lines in. I can't look at an empty shell without getting a pit in my stomach. I like to look at source code to see what makes games tick, and it always feels like I'm learning something, but I always get that same numb feeling if I ever do anything beyond very simple tasks. Anything a more perceptive programmer would be able to see just seeps right through me. The last \"big\" project I ever completed generated bingo boards from a template with random numbers for a friend's project. It felt good to have a problem and slowly figure out how to solve it, and it was the most fun I've had programming in years. How do I get that feeling of euphoria again?

Instead of putting everything in one CSS file, I ended up splitting it into a bunch of smaller files like `header.css`, `utilities.css`, `modals.css`, and so on.  \nHere’s a screenshot of what my VS Code looks like:\n\n[https://prnt.sc/eauZsZQNvkXP](https://prnt.sc/eauZsZQNvkXP)\n\nI just thought it would be easier to keep things organized, but now it feels like maybe I’m making it harder for myself?\n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n* Is this normal, or way too much for a beginner?\n* Is this something actual devs do, or am I going down the wrong path?\n* Would you have stuck with one big CSS file instead, or split things up differently?\n\nSorry if this sounds clueless.

        "author": "JuggernautOk681",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve tried learning coding through online courses and YouTube videos earlier, but honestly, I always felt something was missing. Most of the time, I ended up just following what was shown, without actually understanding *why* we were doing something a certain way. The basics never felt clear, and I was always left with questions like “why exactly is this done like this?”\n\nSo now, I’ve decided to start fresh — this time with a proper focus on understanding things deeply, step by step. My main preference is to **read books or documentation** rather than watching videos. I feel like books allow me to go at my own pace, re-read things, and properly think about what I’m learning. I’ve also heard from others that books usually explain things in more detail and depth compared to many tutorials.\n\nHere’s how I’m planning to approach it:\n\n1. First, I want to learn **general programming concepts** — like how code works, what happens behind the scenes, how computers interpret programs, memory, logic, etc.\n2. Then I’ll move on to **Python**, relearn it properly with all the basics and get confident with it.\n3. After that, I want to get into **C++**, so that I can understand things on a lower level and get better with performance, system-level thinking, etc.\n\nI'm also planning to go into **data structures and algorithms** in between, once I have a decent hold on Python.\n\nSo I’m mainly looking for **book recommendations** (or any really well-explained resources) for:\n\n* Basics of coding and general programming logic\n* Beginner to intermediate Python\n* DSA (preferably in Python, but general ones are okay too)\n* A good path to learn C++ after Python\n* Clean code, writing good code, and long-term coding habits\n\nIf there are any **video courses that explain things really well and in depth**, I’m open to them too, but my first preference will always be books.\n\nIf anyone here has gone through a similar journey or prefers reading like me, I’d love to hear your experience and suggestions. Thanks in advance!",

How would I go about programming a system like that where THEORETICALLY the game never lags, only throttles the tick speed and would it be possible to create a system that is not OS dependent? My only solution currently is to throttle the tick speed until CPU usage is under 80% or less but assume any package checking CPU usage is OS dependent.\n\nIf there's a better way (which i assume there is) im all ears as well.

My question is: **Are there any accountants that switched FROM accounting to SWE? Why did you do so? What were the downsides of accounting that made you switch?**\n\nIt just seems like a way better fit for me personally. I always just wanted a stable, in-demand career that pays moderately well and has good work life balance. I was never interested in FAANG (even though I ended up working at 3 of them, and starting my career there.. but all that did was lead me to an insane burnout and I now work as a SWE at a bank).\n\nI'm jealous of:\n\n* The biggest one for me, is that their work is deterministic. They know when they walk into work that day, exactly what they will do and how long it will take them to do. In SWE? Not the case. I'm given a puzzle that I've never done before, given a deadline to finish it, and asked every single day (multiple times) how close I am to finishing it.\n* The fact that once they do their time at the Big 4 + get their CPA, they are basically set for life. The grind ACTUALLY seems to pay off in their career. In tech? You have to study LeetCode, OOP, System Design over and over and over every time you want to job hop\n* The fact that it's a stable job and literally everyone needs them.\n* The fact that their interviews consist of 1-2 behavioural rounds and that's literally it\n* Immune to AI and offshoring due to legal reasons\n\nAm I looking at accounting too positively?

Why is whenever I hear justification for H1B and STEM-OPT  everywhere on mainstream media, and even codified in US law, court transcripts and policy discussions: they keep saying there's a shortage of STEM workers, especially  tech workers and we need more immigrants to fill those roles. Why do we hear this all the time, but it's never actually supported by data?\n\nFurther, the department of labor actually has a list of jobs known to be in shortage and it doesn't use biased industry reports to determine them: it uses its own data as well as BLS data. This list is called \"Schedule A\" and it allows employers to fast track immigrant visas into these occupations without needing to go through the H1B process.\n\nBut the INA has this weird thing where if a prospective job pays under $60k the employer must recruit US workers first, but it does not offer that protection to jobs that pay over $60k or if the job requires a masters degree. Congress justified this, as saying jobs paying over $60k or requiring a masters is a reasonable proxy to a job that is in shortage. \nBut it's not. Schedule A has existed for just as long as the H1B came about in 1990. This makes me question the purpose of the H1B in the first place.\n\nIf the DOL has the ability to analyze the labor market and determine certain jobs are in dire need, and need skilled immigrant labor, and our those on a dynamic list every year, why do we have \"H1B\" at all? Why can't the actual jobs in shortage, be listed, and the jobs not in shortage have to prove they couldn't find a qualified US citizen before hiring an immigrant?\n\nIt seems congress relied on industry lobbying and their \"facts\" rather than our own DOL and BLS.",

What do you guys think would be the best things to have on your resume nowadays with no work experience, but a CS degree from 2021. I have worked multiple different industries and jobs since then but idek if its worth keeping those on my resume as it relates nothing to tech. I have coding knowledge and basic projects but I know thats not enough. I feel like I need to focus my energy on something with more potential for a positive return aka a job lol.\n\nHere are some ideas Ive had , \n\nMaking a “complex” project in a not popular language. For example specialize entirely on mobile code using something like swift and show a specialization in this language. I feel like everyone’s learning java and python, myself included so would learning a specialized language be more desirable? Or should I just stick with something like a MERN stack and pump out projects that are “more complex” with more universal technologies. \n\nIf contributing to open source, idek how to put that into my resume? “I added three new functions that reduced latency by .5 ms” . Could I make this its own section where I say I have contributed to 10+ open source projects with a link to my github for them to check themselves. Would focusing on open source for experience to pad my resume be a good idea?\n\nAre there any certifications worth getting? AWS or Azure fundamentals? Agile or scrum certs? Cisco or A+ IT certs (even though I dont want to do IT) Anything for hiring managers to look more fondly on me?\n\nWhat are ways to become undeniable to employers that can be achieved through hard work, that most others arnt going to put the time into?\n\nI know its alot, appreciate any responses! \n\nEdit: Guys I know I wasted my potential, I put that in the title!

        "content": "This isn't one of those nonsense posts like \"even medicine is easier than tech,\" \"medicine is AI-proof unlike tech,\" etc. Medicine is a difficult path and not one that should be taken lightly.\n\n**This is more of a rant, and maybe a warning to the many CS students who frequent this sub about what big tech is really like.**\n\nI'm a mid-level software engineer at a big tech company. I make a sizeable amount of money, I work hybrid, and I get plenty of vacation. And yet I'm miserable.\n\nAs the layoffs started, the company culture immediately rotted. I found myself pushing back on others' nonsensical, perf-driven demands. I was making decisions not for technical excellence but for less stressful approvals. I was constantly fighting off attempts to steal scope or credit. Then a coworker sabotaged my work and advertised to L7's how he already had a great plan to fix \"my\" mistakes. (He was promoted for this.)\n\n**I realized that a career in tech is not about good work or good skills. It's about politics, and it gets worse the more senior you get.** I spoke to some mid-level and senior friends, and they've all told me the same, with many of them questioning their careers too.\n\nI started not caring anymore about scalable architectures or sensible design decisions. I went looking for other jobs, then I realized nearly every big company is like this now, not just Amazon. I also realized quickly that all my cold applications were getting trashed without a look; only recruiter calls mattered. (Condolences to all the entry-level folks, it really is rough out there.)\n\n**More importantly, I started questioning the point of it all.** I pursued tech because I liked coding and designing. I liked the idea of working with others to build great things. And I liked the prospect of working anywhere in the world, and not being tied to a single company.\n\nBut above all I wanted to make an impact. I wanted to build software that improved millions of lives. I planned to work my way up to senior in the private sector, save a lot of money, then take a pay cut to go work for the government or a public contractor. Then Elon Musk destroyed that path.\n\nNow, I was studying so hard to get an offer to do... what? Squeeze out 0.02% more ad revenue? Get more people addicted to gambling? Exploit more vulnerable children? Or build tools to let other companies better do those things? Because that's what most big tech companies are, and why they pay the big bucks.\n\nIn college, I was a premed as well as a CS major. I had everything from lab research to volunteer hours, from the courses to the MCAT—all I had to do was send the med school applications. Then I chose to pursue tech instead. After years in the real world, I'm doubting my choice.\n\n**I'm not building things that matter. Most times, I'm not building at all.** Most of my time and energy is devoted to navigating office politics. I didn't sign up for this. I certainly can't imagine 30 more years in this career.\n\nI'm still searching for a new job. But if I don't get an offer in the next few months, I'll be studying again for the MCAT. (My old score expired—what a waste.)\n\nMedicine will be a long and tough road. I'll be working longer hours with less flexibility for somewhat less pay. But at least I'll be doing something that matters, something that makes me proud to go to work every morning. I'll have stress that's meaningful, and a sense of professional fulfillment beyond just my TC.\n\nAnd most of all, I won't have to deal with office politics, every day, every week, every year.",

        "content": "Three and a half years ago I graduated college and was pulled into a startup as the only US dev in a US startup for a full-stack position. The other two devs before me were in India. I was the only dev in the US (during working hours) for over a year before finally getting a second US full-stack dev (then a third and fourth front-end). Today, the small startup where I knew everyone's' name ended up getting bought out and had money pumped into it that ended up making it grow exponentially. Now I only see maybe 5% of who work in my company regularly. Because of my circumstanced, I have been categorized as the \"Go-To Person\" for getting stuff fixed or done in my company during the working hours.\n\nBefore we were bought out, I already had that reputation, being the longest standing dev on the US side. I would get pings from people every couple hours that needed assistance in something they were working on, or needed someone with \"expert knowledge\" on the software in a quick meeting. I was able to balance this with my own work decent enough to still be able to get my work done in a reasonable time. But since our side of the company got exponentially bigger since being bought out, now I get pings ever 15 - 30 min some days and my schedule has been loaded with meetings that require that dev with \"expert knowledge\", even though most of the time I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing (I'm good at figuring it out though).\n\nBecause of this, my productivity is shot. Tickets that should take 2 - 3 days are taking a week or more sometimes. I've talked to my manager over the last year about this and we have made an \"Ask a Dev\" channel for questions that aren't urgent (which has filtered out the obvious and obviously dumb questions that are asked from being asked), urgent stuff now gets filtered through the scrum master which she divides up between me and the only other full-stack that works during the workday, and we've preached, multiple times to not contact any dev directly, even though this only lasts for a little while before everyones \"Super Urgent!\" problem finds its way to my teams chat directly... again...\n\nSo take this as a warning. Don't become the \"Go-To Person\" of your company/division/team if you want to keep your sanity.\n\n  \nEdit: Spelling/grammer errors. I'm sure there is more, but I need to stop ranting and actually work",

However, last year our company started a new company wide rule where we have to work some days in one of our actual retail stores. Now that I've done this multiple times, I actually hate it.\n\n1. Our customers don't like it when they realize that the person they're asking for help actually has no idea because they're a software dev cosplaying as a store employee. \"What type of item do you need to do ABC? I have no idea but let me ask a real store employee, 1 sec.\"\n\n2. I've had store employees treat me harshly upon meeting me because I'm a fake store employee just there for a day, I'm taking time away from them doing their regular stuff while they explain stuff to me, etc... and I also think some resent the salary discrepancy. Sometimes someone will tell me that their family member makes X amount of money and I don't say anything but I'm thinking \"I never asked, I'm just here to comply and keep my job\".\n\n3. None of the things that the store employees complain about are something that I even have any power whatsoever to change or fix. It's just not something that my team or department works on. And instead of me being there, why can't it just be an email from them directly to management? and how many more times am I going to have to keep doing this?\n\nAfter completing one of these visits I'm given an opportunity to fill out a survey which I always do, but then in the future I'm still told basically \"do it or you're fired\". It feels like a bait and switch to me because I joined this company to be a software dev and this program didn't exist at that time.\n\nI know the job market is bad at the moment so I'm continuing to comply, but I just wanted to vent to my fellow devs I guess.",

        "author": "SouthMouth79",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I graduated in May 2023 with a Computer Science degree from a well respected program. Like many others in my class, it was tough landing a full-time role in this market. I did some contract work for a while until I was recently hired full-time as a “Controls and Automation Specialist”. A basic summary of what my division in the company does is that we install and program factory computers.\n\nI didn’t think much of the title of the role before starting; it wasn’t heavily stressed as a distinguishing factor in the interview, job posting, or any further correspondence with the company. It wasn’t until I started that I came to understand that there is a significant distinction between “Specialists” and “Engineers” in my division. Our engineers come from a variety of backgrounds, not just computer related, but from my current understanding, C+A Engineers have more career mobility within the company as well as higher salaries, even in entry-level roles.\n\nWhen I asked about the difference, I was told that because I have a “Computer Science” degree, I’m not considered an engineer and can’t be billed to clients as one. I thought this might be a regional thing, that software engineering isn’t yet considered “real” engineering in the southeast. But today I found out that one of our interns is titled an engineer but is pursuing a degree in Software Engineering; a degree that differs from Computer Science at their university by a single required course (Software Security).\n\nI have plenty of CS grad friends that went on to become Software Engineers, so I didn’t expect the wording of my degree to limit my role like this. I really like my coworkers, the work that I do, and the company I work for. I genuinely pictured myself being part of the company for the long-term. But it’s been hard not to feel like I’m missing out on long-term growth simply because of a technicality in how my education is labeled.\n\nHas anyone else run into this kind of title/pay/growth ceiling based on your degree title? \n\nWould love to hear how others have navigated this or similar situations, or just general suggestions or opinions on how to proceed.\n\nTLDR:\nCS grad working in controls/automation was told I can't hold an \"Engineer\" title, or access related pay and growth, because my degree isn’t labeled “Engineering,” despite doing similar work. Wondering if others have faced this and how they handled it.\n\n",

        "content": "# tldr: Twice in the past year I was hired in companies (employed on full time and paid) while doing absolutely nothing (never put on any project).\n\nHi, I'm backend/fullstack developer with experience of just few years.\n\nLast year I spent 6 months doing absolutely NOTHING in the big IT company from India. I was hired as developer in a project for a client from finance/fintech industry. The project was postponed or never started, and I've spent my entire time in there doing absolutely nothing, however I was told that they will find replacement project for me eventually, then 1 month before the end of my employment contract I was suggested to look for another job as they won't extend my employment. Can't say that I didn't expect that after few months of doing nothing, but I was really pissed off. At the time I could already be part of some nice project, get the know-how and be really productive in some other company.\n\n**2024 was my worst year in the industry in terms of looking for a new job, I was unemployed for few months after that company.**\n\nNow my current position - the same story. Very similiar IT Indian company, I won't give you any names but there is a few of them so you can probably figure it out. I was hired as backend dev at the beginning of the year, and so far I had few internal interviews for the various projects, but I don't even get feedback from them.\n\n**As I learned from my previous experience I have found another job as the contractor in the bank and I'm doing great here.**\n\nMy employment in the do-nothing-company terminates in few months and I'm not resigning until they actually try put me on a project. I don't feel like I am cheating because this is second time that someone wastes my time. I'm still a beginner in the industry and in this very crowded market on every single interview everyone asks me about my experience in all the companies I've been working for - **I don't want to lie on my resume, but I also don't want to tell my interviewer that professionally I was not engaged in any project/team since the end of 2023, and why I am jumping between companies after barely 6 months of employment.**\n\nSo, do you have experience like this? I know that sometimes you just sit on the bench as a contractor, but this is other situation and often after some time you just stop getting paid. Here I was full time employed, got paid and contributed absolutely nothing, twice. I probably won't even mention my current do-nothing-company on my CV.\n\nI'm sick of companies that are looking for developer while not having any position for them. And I completely understand that this is kind of a privilige nowadays and sounds like a dream job for many people, but in IT every year of your experience counts, and If you was hired on paper but got nothing from it, then it's going to turn out terribly for you in the future. Of course in both of those companies I tried to utilize my time and try to learn/work with new things on my own, but this is not the same. And obviously for the entire past year I was constantly stressed, not sure about my future and I felt there was no stability in my life and that something is wrong with me.",

Sure, there are many tools that automate some of these processes, but from my tiny experience in this domain, there seems to be many situations where writing custom scripts gives you the advantage?\n\n2.**System Admins/CyberSecurity:** C'mon Sys Admins/CyberSecurity Consultants, you shouldn't even be in this discussion since I know you guys have to or perhaps should automate some of those tasks you handle every day lol\n\n3\\*\\*.UI/UX Designers:\\*\\*  A lot of the UI/UX designers in my circle were slowly funneled into jobs that required them to also know some FE Programming.

I’ve developed solid expertise in Java/Linux etc and untangling hairy production problems. I'm the go-to when things go sideways, but… I’m tired.\n\nFor the past 2 years, I’ve been putting in the time:\n\nGrinding Leetcode\n\nStudying system design\n\nTrying to shift my thinking from reactive (support) to proactive (engineering)\n\nI have got 3 on-sites so far but they fell through. Getting an interview seems to be rough. \n\n\nI’m 42 now, with a family, and working in a toxic environment that’s mentally exhausting. The longer I stay, the harder it feels to focus. \n\n\nIs it too late for me to pivot into a dev or system design-heavy role? Or should I double down on my support experience and build a niche consulting gig around that instead?\n\nAnyone here made a late-career pivot from support to dev? Or managed to reposition their career meaningfully after 40? I’m open to hard truths and honest advice.\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I was reflecting on [u/SnooTangerines9703](https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooTangerines9703/)'s [post on building startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1kq8hq3/fk_it_lets_build_startups/). It's something that’s been on my mind for a while. I used to think it was too tedious or far-fetched, but lately, desperation and a deep hunger to make something real have completely overridden that imposter syndrome I carried. Reading their post was like hearing my own thoughts said out loud made me hyperfocus on it.\n\nSo here’s what I’m proposing (and may even build myself if I get enough support behind me):\n\n**One group. One community.**  \nLet’s stop being divided and conquered in a dog-eat-dog grind. Let’s build *together*. Learn together. Grow together.\n\nThe idea is to start a community, on Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, Reddit, wherever there's traction where anyone who's serious about learning and building can join. No gatekeeping, just mutual accountability.\n\n**How it would work:**\n\n* Each member logs their learning journey with a start and end date, plus their chosen path (e.g. [`MOOC.fi`](http://MOOC.fi) `Java => Java Internship (3 months) & Java II (3 months)`, `Harvard CS50 => (3 months) => w: Web Dev Internship, ai: AI Internship`, etc.).\n* Proof of completion is required (certs, GitHub commits, demo videos). This isn’t about fluff, it’s about **real growth**\n* Every Thursday or Friday we could have a community event like DSA Thursday/Friday\n* After internship, or if you want to skip it would be **Entry-Level** (the initial commitment would be **6 to 12 months**)\n* Everyone begins by building a **personal project** to set a baseline and gauge their current level.\n* If possible, everyone at this stage is assigned an accountability buddy, preferably one that isn't on the same team so that one person isn't doing the work of another. \n* After that, we begin and transition into **collaborative projects** run in an agile team format. Everyone keeps their main role they want and rotates any unused/unsure roles: designer, dev, PM, tester, to build real-world skills.\n\n# The exposure strategy:\n\nOnce a project is finished, we create a **video breakdown** and post it on LinkedIn, X (Twitter), YouTube, or wherever else makes sense. \n\nEach person is credited for their work and gets the exposure they deserve.\n\nLet’s be real:  \nMost of us are **introverts**.  \nSome of us are **highly skilled**.  \nAnd many of us are **still unemployed**, even while being more capable than folks earning six figures.\n\nThis isn't just about skill, it's about being **seen**.  \nWe need a system that clears the dust off our shine.  \nMany of us are grasping at straws.  \n**Maybe this is what we actually need: real experience, real proof, and real support.**\n\n# Long-term vision:\n\n* After 6+ months, or if your **personal project** stands out, you transition into a **junior developer role** within the group.\n* You start to take on leadership responsibilities and begin developing those soft skills like communication, initiative, and mentoring.\n* By then, or even earlier, you should be ready for a paid role. If not, you’ll still have a strong portfolio, exposure, and momentum to start freelancing or even launch your own thing.\n\n# What a full journey might look like (if starting from zero):\n\n1. **Internship Phase (Learning Phase):** \n   * Java I & II (MOOC.fi), or Full-Stack, or Python, or 2x+ CS50 courses, etc.\n   * \\~6 months total (self-paced)\n   * Initial project (\\~1 month)\n   * Career development + feedback\n2. **Entry-Level Phase**\n   * 3 to 12 projects built with team\n   * Weekly GitHub updates, project demos, and social proof\n   * Lasts 6 to 12 months\n3. **Junior Phase**\n   * \\~6+ months of group work and possible freelancing\n   * Exposure, mentorship, and leadership opportunities\n\nIn total, you’d have **about 2 years of experience**, real-world projects, team collaboration skills, leadership development, and consistent exposure. With that kind of portfolio and growth, **you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who wouldn’t hire you**.\n\nI may start this, but I obviously can’t do it alone.  \nIf you’re interested, or if you have suggestions to improve the idea, **drop a comment or DM me**. Please share this with anyone you think may benefit from this style of rigor, discipline and community.\n\nLet's stop moping and wallowing away our best years in self pity.\n\nLet’s stop waiting for experience and start **building it**.",

        "content": "TLDR: Interned at a non-tech company for 1.5 years, recently got offered a part-time-to-full-time software dev role on their AI use case team. Super excited, but nervous since there’s no real junior dev pipeline or formal training, and I’m jumping straight from student to full-time dev in a small team that mostly hires experienced people.\n\n\n\nI interned at this company for about 1.5 years with 8 moths full-time and the rest part-time.\n\nDuring that time, I worked on a pretty wide range of stuff: manually testing new software, creating architectural diagrams, documenting codebases, and toward the end, helping a new AI team build web apps with AI-driven features.\n\nIt’s been about two months since the internship ended. When I wrapped up, there was talk of a full-time offer closer to graduation (which is in August). But recently, they reached out and said they’d actually like to offer me a position now—starting part-time, then moving to full-time after I graduate. I asked about the role, and they said “AI Developer,” which basically just means I’d be a software dev on the AI use case team (so not data science or ML).\n\nI’m super excited because I loved the team environment and like most of us our dream is software dev. That said, I’m also nervous.\n\nThis company isn’t a tech company, it’s actually pretty far from one. And because of that, the structure is a bit different. There’s not really a formal junior engineer pipeline or training program. Most people get hired with several years of experience already under their belt. I do know a couple folks who came in a year or two after graduating, but even then, it was through a setup where they’d already been doing independent contract work for a while.\n\nI know I’m a strong developer, and I learn quickly, but I also know I benefit a lot from structure and guidance. Obviously working with the team towards the end of my internship did give me SOME experience, but I still feel like the jump from student to full time dev is massive and I’m worried about working in an environment that might not have that change in the forefront of their mind. Especially given that the team I’d join only has a handful of developers (maybe 3).",

        "content": "Roblox PhD Internship interview reflection\n\nI'm a third year PhD student at a t20, no visa sponsorship required. Generally work on applying LLM and graph neural networks to social science problems. Applied for a PhD research intern position.\n\n1. Got OA, it was dumb as fuck. Had to download and play games in Roblox. They're basically iq tests where you had to do like factory optimization and design cars to cross obstacle courses or whatever. I was just like fuck it and got basically a 0 on the first game and gave up on the rest because it wasn't worth the effort lol. \n\n2. Recruiter schedules a call with me and basically tells me I'm moving on to the interview calls. Tells me to just redo the OAs for completion and basically that the scores don't matter. I guess they do resume screening before OA results and if your experience is relevant enough they don't care lmao. \n\n3. Get a crappy score on the second game, and third OA segment is a bunch of behavioral scenarios, like \"your boss is wrong about something, how do you approach the situation\". No coding OA, interestingly. \n\n4. Had a thirty minute behavioral round with pretty standard questions, \"tell me about a project where you had a different approach than stakeholders wanted\", etc etc. \n\n5. 45 minute coding round. Really easy? I feel like I've seen other internship reports where people are getting LC hards, maybe they make it easier for the research positions. Question was basically valid parentheses but you also had to handle quote strings. Seemed like it focused more on like communication and figuring out how to handle edge cases. \n\n6. Then they scheduled a ML deep dive with the hiring manager. 1 hour, I basically presented a few of my papers and they asked pretty detailed questions about how I made specific training/dataset/evaluation questions. Lots of reflection on what I could've done differently etc. I really enjoyed this round, it felt like a very good way to measure expertise and ML depth. \n\n7. Whole process took place over 2-3 weeks, very efficient, quick feedback and scheduling of next rounds. I got the official offer 3 business days after the last round. \n\nOverall very good process! Much easier than I expected, but it's possible they identified a research fit and wanted to hurry the process along a bit lol. If they didn't make people do the silly games, I'd say it was a nearly perfect process. ",

Maybe this could be a good niche to pick out in the software dev world? Would recruiters just dismiss it because it’s “games” and not some spectacular system design?

But after submitting somewhere between 3,500 and 5,000 applications over the last eight months, I’m burned out.\n\nA few months ago, I was still getting some traction, mostly unpaid or internship roles (I’m in one now). But lately, even those have dried up, despite leveling up my skills. Eight months ago, I had a solid foundation in Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python, along with frameworks like React and Spring Boot. Since then, I’ve added multi-cloud experience, DevOps, and AI concepts like RAG.\n\nVery rarely I’d gone through complete interview processes: submissions, interviews, take-homes, technical rounds, only to get ghosted or declined. One company was at least honest and told me I needed another year of experience, and that their policy prevented them from hiring me.\n\nI recently got into a strong Master’s program. I should feel excited, but I’m honestly not sure if it’s worth it anymore. I’m even thinking of turning it down because I don’t know if it’ll actually change anything.\n\nIf anyone knows of any solid job resources in NYC or nearby, please share. It's a major metropolitan hub, so there should be something. At this point, I’m not picky. It’s frustrating to think I had better opportunities in CS related roles (with better pay too!) when I was in high school than I do now, right as I’m graduating college and possibly heading into grad school.\n\n**TLDR:** I’m completely lost and looking for help or direction.",

        "content": "I got a Computer Information Systems degree from DeVry (don't judge, I didn't know any better back then), in the early 2000s. Ended up taking a job doing insurance claims because the pay was better than the entry- level CS jobs and because most employers didn't really take my expensive, but largely worthless, degree all that seriously...\n\nThen I moved to another state where there were no insurance companies, so I did various jobs until landing on a freelance writing gig that I did until ChatGpt put that company out of business. Now I'm looking for work and I'm considering trying to get a degree in something from a legit college, but I'm not sure how hard it is to find an entry level job period, let alone find an entry level job at 50 in the tech field.\n\nThe school I'm considering will count the degree I have toward the common core stuff, so basically I'd need just the classes specific to my major. Is it worth spending the money on or am I better off hoping to catch on to some random job that doesn't require a relevant degree?\n\n  \nETA:\n\nThanks to everyone who provided constructive and helpful feedback. To answer some questions: No, CS isn't my dream. I had an interest and aptitude for it when I was young, but I really don't care about it anymore. This is just a terrible job market and I'm trying to find some way to improve my resume in the hopes of finding a halfway decent job, like lots of people.\n\nSo why CS? because believe or not, it keeps getting recommended by people as a \"good field for career changers and older workers.\" Even the silly aptitude test thing they make new students take at the University recommends it and frankly, my impression of the tech field has always been that it's crowded, being heavily outsourced and potentially negatively impacted by AI in the same way my old profession as a writer has been. So, the point of this post was to find out from people who actually work in the field if my impression was wrong and all the people recommending it are right or full of shit. Seems the consensus is that my impression was right and I should look at other options.",

They’re all in relatively the same location and all are full time upon placement(not contract to hire). \n\nThe two considerations I’m struggling with the most are:\n\n1. Tech stack. I’ve largely been full stack with JavaScript(React) and Python(Django). Some roles have some python, others have a smattering of full stack but most are Java roles. I did a lot of Java in undergrad and early in my career but Java 8 is about the last time I really was Java heavy. Trying to weigh roles with tech I’m comfortable in against immersing myself in Java to insulate against future job searches. \n\n2. Pay discrepancy between large and small contractors. I’ve had offers from Booz Allen and Leidos along with multiple small contractors(<50 employees). The smaller companies have routinely offered ~20-30% more total compensation. I’ve considered asking the larger contractors to match but I doubt they will. \n\nEntirely new to this industry and would love any/all thoughts before making a massive career shift. ",

So not only do I have to interrupt the logic thread which is necessary for a coherent, correct solution, I also need to translate it into English language to be presentable and make sense, on the fly.

On top of the pressure of being watched and judged for it.\n\nThat’s why I can program a solution in whole, then I can explain it well after it’s all done. Each thread can complete one by one without loss of context mid execution.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Ideally if you used to be bad at this, but got significantly better?

        "content": "Posting for a friend who recently joined Reddit but doesn’t have the min. 10 karma to post.\n\nIncoming senior CS major and I have to make a decision between taking a fall 2025 SDE internship at Amazon and missing my senior fall semester. This would mean missing a full year of classes, as I’m currently studying abroad spring semester this year. I’ll still graduate on time, but it will be difficult, and it’s unfortunate to lose a year of the college experience when I have the rest of my life to work in the industry.\n\nOn the other hand, I could reject the offer and work at a startup over the summer. While the experience would still be valuable, the startup is in Spain, so unlikely I could work there after I graduate. Additionally, Amazon carries more weight in terms of future recruitment. But I could complete my senior year at my university and have a manageable schedule.\n\nI’m leaning toward rejecting the offer since I don’t want to miss another semester of college, but at the same time, I feel like I’d be giving up a valuable opportunity.\n\nAny guidance from people working in software would be super helpful. Thank you.",
