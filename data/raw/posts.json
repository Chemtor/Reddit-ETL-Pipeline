        "content": "*Disclaimer: this post is nothing but a rant.*\n\n---\n\nI've recently inherited a data project which is almost entirely based in Azure synapse.\n\nI can't even begin to describe the level of hatred and despair that this platform generates in me.\n\nLet's start with the biggest offender: that being Spark as the only available runtime. Because OF COURSE one MUST USE Spark to move 40 bits of data, god forbid someone thinks a firm has (*gasp!*) small data, even if the amount of companies that actually need a distributed system is less than the amount of fucks I have left to give about this industry as a whole.\n\nLuckily, I can soothe my rage by meditating during the downtimes, beacause testing code means that, if your cluster is cold, you have to wait between 2 and 5 business days to see results, meaning that each day one gets 5 meaningful commits in at most. Work-life balance, yay!\n\nSecond, the bane of any sensible software engineer and their sanity: Notebooks. I believe notebooks are an invention of Satan himself, because there is not a single chance that a benevolent individual made the choice of putting notebooks in production.\n\nI know that one day, after the 1000th notebook I'll have to fix, my sanity will eventually run out, and I will start a terrorist movement against notebook users. Either that or I will immolate myself alive to the altar of sound software engineering in the hope of restoring equilibrium.\n\nThird, we have the biggest lie of them all, the scam of the century, the slithery snake, the greatest pretender: \"yOu dOn't NEeD DaTA enGINEeers!!1\".\n\nBecause since engineers are expensive, these idiotic corps had to sell to other even more idiotic corps the lie that with these magical NO CODE tools, even Gina the intern from Marketing can do data pipelines!\n\nBut obviously, Gina the intern from Marketing has marketing stuff to do, leaving those pipelines uncovered. Who's gonna do them now? Why of course, the same exact data engineers one was trying to replace!\n\nExcept that instead of being provided with proper engineering toolbox, they now have to deal with an environment tailored for people whose shadow outshines their intellect, castrating the productivity many times over, because dragging arbitrary boxes to get a for loop done is clearly SO MUCH faster and productive than literally anything else.\n\nI understand now why our salaries are high: it's not because of the skill required to conduct our job. It's to pay the levels of insanity that we're forced to endure.\n\nBut don't worry, AI will fix it.",

        "author": "bdadeveloper",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently completed a data engineering screening at a startup and now I’m wondering if my approach was right and how other engineers would approach or what more experienced devs  would look for. The screening was around 50 minutes, and they had me share my screen and use a blank Google Doc to jot down thoughts as needed — I assume to make sure I wasn’t using AI.\n\nThe Problem:\n\n\t“How would you design a system to ingest ~100TB of JSON data from multiple S3 buckets”\n\nMy Approach (thinking out loud, real-time mind you):\n\t•\tI proposed chunking the ingestion (~1TB at a time) to avoid memory overload and increase fault tolerance.\n\t•\tStressed the need for a normalized target schema, since JSON structures can vary slightly between sources and timestamps may differ.\n\t•\tSuggested Dask for parallel processing and transformation, using Python (I’m more familiar with it than Spark).\n\t•\tFor ingestion, I’d use boto3 to list and pull files, tracking ingestion metadata like source_id, status, and timestamps in a simple metadata catalog (Postgres or lightweight NoSQL).\n\t•\tTalked about a medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold):\n\t•\tBronze: raw JSON copies\n\t•\tSilver: cleaned & normalized data\n\t•\tGold: enriched/aggregated data for BI consumption\n\nWhat clicked mid-discussion:\n\nAfter asking a bunch of follow-up questions, I realized the data seemed highly textual, likely news articles or similar.  I was asking so many questions lol.That led me to mention:\n\n\t•\tOnce the JSON is cleaned and structured (title, body, tags, timestamps), it makes sense to vectorize the content using embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, Sentence-BERT, etc.).\n\t•\tYou could then store this in a vector database (like Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate) to support semantic search.\n\t•\tTechniques like cosine similarity could allow you to cluster articles, find duplicates, or offer intelligent filtering in the downstream dashboard (e.g., “Show me articles similar to this” or group by theme).\n\nThey seemed interested in the retrieval angle and I tied this back to the frontend UX, because I deduced the target of the end data was a front end dashboard that would be in front of a client \n\nThe part that tripped me up:\n\nThey asked: “What would happen if the source data (e.g., from Amazon S3) went down?”\n\nMy answer was:\n\n\t“As soon as I ingest a file, I’d immediately store a copy in our own controlled storage layer — ideally following a medallion model — to ensure we can always roll back or reprocess without relying on upstream availability.”\n\nLooking back, I feel like that was a decent answer, but I wasn’t 100% sure if I framed it well. I could’ve gone deeper into S3 resiliency, versioning, or retry logic.\n\nWhat I didn’t do:\n\t•\tI didn’t write much in the Google Doc — most of my answers were verbal.\n\t•\tI didn’t live code — I just focused on system design and real-world workflows.\n\t•\tI sat back in my chair a bit (was calm), maintained decent eye contact, and ended by asking them real questions (tools they use, scraping frameworks, and why they liked the company, etc.).\n\nOf course nobody here knows what they wanted, but now I’m wondering if my solution made sense (I’m new to data engineering honestly):\n\t•\tShould I have written more in the doc to “prove” I wasn’t cheating or to better structure my thoughts?\n\t•\tWas the vectorization + embedding approach appropriate, or overkill?\n\t•\tDid my fallback answer about S3 downtime make sense ?\n",

Pulled Playlist data using Spotify API \n2. Created a staging Postgres DB to store raw data of the Playlist \n3. Cleaned the data and modeled the data into a STAR schema in a new db.\n4. Created Facts table containing granular data for Playlist- track_id, names, artists id , album ID\n5. Created dimension tables - for artists (ID and names) , for albums (ID and names)\n6. Used Genius API for fetching lyrics for each track\n7. Created another dimensions tables for lyrics (IDs and lyrics as text)\n8. Used Gemini API (free tier) to analyze lyrics for each song to return a json output. {'NSFW_TAG: [EXPLICIT/MILD/SAFE]}, {'Keywords found': [list of curse words found}\n9. Updated the lyrics dimensions to store the NSFW tagging and keywords.\n\nI have planned few more steps to execute:\n1.Use AIRFLOW for orchestration\n2. Recreate it in cloud instead of local db\ndB\n3. Introduce some visualizations in power bi or tableau to show some charts like artist vs NSFW tagging , etc.\n\nSo at this point, I am looking for feedback:\n1. to improve my skills in Data Engineering.\n2. Also since the Data size is very small, any suggestions on how to create a porject with larger datasets.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated and would help me immensely. \n",

        "content": "I’m a newly minted Data Engineer, with what little experience I have, I’ve noticed quite a few glaring issues with my workplace, causing me to start hating my job. Here are a few:\n- We are in a near constant state of migration. We keep moving from one cloud provider to another for no real reason at all, and are constantly decommissioning ETL pipelines and making new ones to serve the same purpose. \n- We have many data vendors, each of which has its own standard (in terms of format, access etc). This requires us to make a dedicated ETL pipeline for each vendor (with some degree of code reuse).\n- Tribal knowledge and poor documentation plagues everything. We have tables (and other data assets) with names that are not descriptive and poorly documented. And so, data discovery (to do something like composing an analytical query) requires discussion with senior level employees who are have tribal knowledge. Doing something as simple as writing a SQL query took me much longer than expected for this reason.\n- Integrating new data vendors seems to always be an ad-hoc process done by higher ups, and is not done in a way that involves the people who actually work with the data on a day-to-day basis. \n\nI don’t intend to complain. I just want to know if other people are facing the same issues as I am. If this is true, then I’ll start figuring out a solution to solve this problem. \n\nAdditionally, if there are other problems you’d like to point out (other than people being difficult to work with), please do so.

The benchmarks covered both full initial loads and Change Data Capture (CDC) on a large dataset (billions of rows for full load, tens of millions of changes for CDC) over a 24-hour window.\n\nMore details here: [https://olake.io/docs/connectors/postgres/benchmarks](https://olake.io/docs/connectors/postgres/benchmarks)  \nHow the dataset was generated: [https://github.com/datazip-inc/nyc-taxi-data-benchmark/tree/remote-postgres](https://github.com/datazip-inc/nyc-taxi-data-benchmark/tree/remote-postgres)\n\n# Some observations:\n\n* OLake hit \\~46K rows/sec sustained throughput across billions of rows without bottlenecking storage or compute.\n* $75 cost was infra-only (no license fees). Fivetran and Airbyte costs ballooned mostly due to runtime and license/credit models.\n* OLake retries gracefully. No manual interventions needed unlike Debezium.\n* Airbyte struggled massively at scale — couldn't complete run without retries. Estuary better but still \\~11x slower.\n\nSharing this to understand if these numbers also match with your personal experience with these tool.\n\nNote: Full Load is free for Fivetran. ",

Yesterday around 4:15PM EST a recruiter calls me up (Indian) and asks if I have 15 minutes to speak. She asks me about my years of experience and then proceeds to ask questions like how would I manage spark clusters, what is the default idle time of a cluster. This has happened before where someone has randomly called me up and asked me questions but no squeak from them later on. As an individual desperate for a job I had previously answered these demeaning questions starting from second highest salary to the difference between ETL and ELT. But yesterday I was in no mood what so ever. She asked what file types I have worked on and then proceeded to ask me the difference between parquet and delta live tables. I mentioned 2 or 3 I had in mind at that moment and asked her not to ask me google questions, to which she was offended. She then went on to mention the definition and 7 points on their difference. Any other day I would have moved on saying that sorry I don't memorize these stuff, but again I wanted to have my share of the fun and asked her why each is used and when and this ended in her frantically saying that delta live tables are default and better that's why we use it.\n\nI would love to know if anyone in this group has had similar experiences.

        "author": "YerayR14",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently based in Spain, so while the job market isn’t great, it’s not as tough as in the US. A few months ago, during my final year of Computer Engineering, I realized I’m genuinely passionate about the data field, especially Data Engineering and Analytics. Since then, I’ve been self-studying with the goal of starting as a Data Analyst and eventually becoming a Data Engineer.\n\nSince January, I’ve been doing an internship at a large consulting firm (180K+ employees worldwide). Initially, they didn’t give much detail about the technologies I’d be working with, but I had no other offers, so I accepted. It turned out to involve Adelia Studio, CGS, AS400, and some COBOL, technologies unrelated to my long-term goals.\n\nThese teams usually train interns in legacy systems, hoping some will stay even if it’s not what they want. But I’ve been clear about my direction and decided to take the risk. I spoke with my manager about possibly switching to a more aligned project. Some might have accepted the initial path and tried to pivot later, but I didn’t want to begin my career in a role I have zero interest in.\n\nLuckily, he understood my situation and said he’d look into possible alternatives. One of the main reasons they’re open to the change is because of my attitude and soft skills. They see genuine interest and initiative in me. That said, the feedback I’ve received on my technical performance has also been very positive. As he told me: *“We can teach someone any tech stack in the long term, but if they can’t communicate properly, they’ll be difficult to work with.”* Just a reminder that soft skills are as important as hard skills. It doesn’t matter how technically good you are if you can’t collaborate or communicate effectively with your team and clients.\n\nThankfully, I’ve been given the chance to switch to a new project working with Murex, a widely used platform in the banking sector for trading, risk, and financial reporting. I’ll be working with technologies like Python, PL/SQL (Oracle), Shell scripting, Jira... while gaining exposure to automated testing, data pipelines, and financial data processing.\n\nHowever, while this project does involve some database work and scripting, it will largely revolve around working directly with the Murex platform, which isn’t strongly aligned with my long-term goal of becoming a Data Engineer. That’s why I still have some doubts. I know that Murex itself has very little correlation with that career path, but some of the tasks I’ll be doing, such as data validation, automation, and working with databases, could still help me build relevant experience.\n\nSo overall, I see it as a better option than my previous assignment, since it brings me closer to the kind of work I want to do, even if it’s not with the most typical tools in the data ecosystem. I’d be really interested to hear what others think. Do you see value in gaining experience through a Murex-based project if your long-term goal is to become a Data Engineer? Any thoughts or advice are more than welcome.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that I was told there may be opportunities to move to a more data-focused team in the future. Of course I would need to prove my skills whether through performance, projects, technical tests or completing a master’s program related to the field.\n\nThanks to anyone who took the time to read through this and offer any kind of feedback or advice. I genuinely appreciate it. Have a good day.",

        "content": "**Hi folks,**\n\nI’m a data scientist, and over the years I’ve run into the same pattern across different teams and projects:\n\nMarketing, ops, product each team has their own system (Airtable, Mailchimp, CRM, custom tools). When it’s time to build BI dashboards or forecasting models, they export **flat, denormalized CSV files** often multiple files filled with repeated data, inconsistent column names, and no clear keys.\n\nEven the core databases behind the scenes are sometimes just raw transaction or log tables with minimal structure. And when we try to request a cleaner version of the data, the response is often something like:\n\n>“We can’t share it, it contains personal information.”\n\nSo we end up spending days writing custom scripts, drawing ER diagrams, and trying to reverse-engineer schemas and still end up with brittle pipelines. The root issues never really go away, and that slows down everything: dashboards, models, insights.\n\nAfter running into this over and over, I built a small tool for myself called **LayerNEXUS** to help bridge the gap:\n\n* Upload one or many CSVs (even messy, denormalized ones)\n* Automatically detect relationships across files and suggest a clean, normalized (3NF) schema\n* Export ready-to-run SQL (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite)\n* Preview a visual ERD\n* Optional AI step for smarter key/type detection\n\nIt’s free to try no login required for basic schema generation, and GitHub users get a few AI credits for the AI features.  \n🔗 [https://layernexus.com](https://layernexus.com) *(I’m the creator just sharing for feedback, not pushing anything)*\n\nIf you’re dealing with raw log-style tables and trying to turn them into an efficient, well-structured database, this tool might help your team design something more scalable and maintainable from the ground up.\n\nWould love your thoughts:\n\n* Do you face similar issues?\n* What would actually make this kind of tool useful in your workflow?\n\n**Thanks in advance!**  \nMax",

I consider myself advanced in Power BI — not an expert, but someone who can solve most problems, including performance tuning, RLS, OLS, Tabular Editor, etc.\n\nCompany 2 – I built and delivered a Data Platform for a retail company (+7000 employees) using Microsoft Fabric. I was the main and principal engineer for the platform for 1.5 years, using Azure Data Factory, Dataflows, Spark Notebooks (basic Spark and Python, such as reading, writing, using APIs, partitioning...), Delta Tables (very good understanding), schema modeling (silver and gold layers), lakehouse governance, understanding business needs, and creating complex SQL queries to extract data from transactional databases. I consider myself intermediate-advanced in SQL (for the market), including window functions, CTEs, etc. I can solve many intermediate and almost all easy LeetCode problems.\n\nCompany 3 – I just started (20,000+ employees). I'm working in a Data Integration team, using a lot of Talend for ingestion from various sources, and also collaborating with the Databricks team.\n\nFreelance Projects (2 years) – I developed some Power BI dashboards and organized databases for two small companies using Sheets, excel and BigQuery.\n\nNowadays, I'm learning a lot of Talend to deliver my work in the best way possible. By the end of the year, I might need to move to another country for family reasons. I’ll step away from the Data Engineering field for a while and will have time to study (maybe for 1.5 years), so I would like to strengthen my knowledge base.\n\nI can program in Python a bit. I’ve created some functions, connected to Microsoft Graph through Spark Notebooks, ingested data, and used Selenium for personal projects. I haven't developed my technical skills further mainly because I haven't needed to use Python much at work.\n\nI don’t plan to study Databricks, Snowflake, Data Factory, DBT, BigQuery, and AIs deeply, since I already have some experience with them. I understand their core concepts, which I think is enough for now. I’ll have the opportunity to practice these tools through freelancing in the future. I believe I just need to understand what each tool does — the core concepts remain the same. Or am I wrong?\n\nI’ve planned a few things to study. I believe a Data Engineer with 5 years of experience should starts understand algorithms, networking, programming languages, software architecture, etc. I found the OSSU University project (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). Since I’ve already completed an engineering degree, I don’t need to do everything again, but it looks like a really good path.\n\nSo, my plan — following OSSU — is to complete these subjects over the next 1.5 years:\n\nSystematic Program Design\n\nClass-based Program Design\n\nProgramming Languages, Part A (Is that necessary?)\n\nProgramming Languages, Part B (Is that necessary?)\n\nProgramming Languages, Part C (Is that necessary?)\n\nObject-Oriented Design\n\nSoftware Architecture\n\nMathematics for Computer Science (Is that necessary?)\n\nThe Missing Semester of Your CS Education (Looks interesting)\n\nBuild a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris\n\nBuild a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part II\n\nOperating Systems: Three Easy Pieces\n\nComputer Networking: a Top-Down Approach\n\nDivide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms\n\nGraph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures\n\nGreedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming\n\nShortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them\n\nCybersecurity Fundamentals\n\nPrinciples of Secure Coding\n\nIdentifying Security Vulnerabilities\n\nIdentifying Security Vulnerabilities in C/C++ \n\nProgramming or Exploiting and Securing Vulnerabilities in Java Applications\n\nDatabases: Modeling and Theory\n\nDatabases: Relational Databases and SQL\n\nDatabases: Semistructured Data\n\nMachine Learning\n\nComputer Graphics\n\nSoftware Engineering: Introduction\nEthics, Technology and Engineering (Is that necessary?)\n\nIntellectual Property Law in Digital Age (Is that necessary?)\n\nData Privacy Fundamentals\nAdvanced programming\n\nAdvanced systems\n\nAdvanced theory\n\nAdvanced Information Security\n\nAdvanced math (Is that necessary?)\n\n\nAny other recommendations is very welcoming!!",

Set up your stack with docker\n\nSave this as `docker-compose.yml` (includes Postgres, Kafka, Zookeeper, and Kafka Connect):\n\n    services:\n      zookeeper:\n        image: quay.io/debezium/zookeeper:3.1\n        ports: [\"2181:2181\"]\n      kafka:\n        image: quay.io/debezium/kafka:3.1\n        depends_on: [zookeeper]\n        ports: [\"29092:29092\"]\n        environment:\n          ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181\n          KAFKA_LISTENERS: INTERNAL://0.0.0.0:9092,EXTERNAL://0.0.0.0:29092\n          KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: INTERNAL://kafka:9092,EXTERNAL://localhost:29092\n          KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT,EXTERNAL:PLAINTEXT\n          KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: INTERNAL\n          KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1\n      connect:\n        image: quay.io/debezium/connect:3.1\n        depends_on: [kafka]\n        ports: [\"8083:8083\"]\n        environment:\n          BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS: kafka:9092\n          GROUP_ID: 1\n          CONFIG_STORAGE_TOPIC: connect_configs\n          OFFSET_STORAGE_TOPIC: connect_offsets\n          STATUS_STORAGE_TOPIC: connect_statuses\n          KEY_CONVERTER_SCHEMAS_ENABLE: \"false\"\n          VALUE_CONVERTER_SCHEMAS_ENABLE: \"false\"\n      postgres:\n        image: debezium/postgres:15\n        ports: [\"5432:5432\"]\n        command: postgres -c wal_level=logical -c max_wal_senders=10 -c max_replication_slots=10\n        environment:\n          POSTGRES_USER: dbz\n          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: dbz\n          POSTGRES_DB: inventory\n\nThen run:\n\n    bashdocker compose up -d\n\n# 2. Configure Postgres and create test table\n\n    bash\n    # Create replication user\n    docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"CREATE USER repuser WITH REPLICATION ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'repuser';\"\n    \n    # Create test table\n    docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"CREATE TABLE customers (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), email VARCHAR(255));\"\n    \n    # Enable full row images for updates/deletes\n    docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"ALTER TABLE customers REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;\"\n\n# 3. Register Debezium connector\n\nCreate a file named `register-postgres.json`:\n\n    json{\n      \"name\": \"inventory-connector\",\n      \"config\": {\n        \"connector.class\": \"io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector\",\n        \"database.hostname\": \"postgres\",\n        \"database.port\": \"5432\",\n        \"database.user\": \"repuser\",\n        \"database.password\": \"repuser\",\n        \"database.dbname\": \"inventory\",\n        \"topic.prefix\": \"inventory\",\n        \"slot.name\": \"inventory_slot\",\n        \"publication.autocreate.mode\": \"filtered\",\n        \"table.include.list\": \"public.customers\"\n      }\n    }\n\nRegister it:\n\n    bash\n    curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data u/register-postgres.json http://localhost:8083/connectors\n\n# 4. Test it out\n\nOpen a Kafka consumer to watch for changes:\n\n    bash\n    docker compose exec kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --topic inventory.public.customers --from-beginning\n\nIn another terminal, insert a test row:\n\n    bash\n    docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"INSERT INTO customers(name,email) VALUES ('Alice','alice@example.com');\"\n\n**🏁 You should see a JSON message appear in your consumer with the change event! 🏁**\n\nOf course, if you already have a database running locally, you can extract that from the docker and adjust the connector config (step 3) to just point to that table.\n\nI wrote a [complete step-by-step tutorial](https://blog.sequinstream.com/postgres-cdc-with-debezium-complete-step-by-step-tutorial/) with detailed explanations of each step if you need a bit more detail!",

        "content": "Debezium is almost always associated with Kafka and the Kafka Connect run time. But that is just one of three ways to stand up Debezium.\n\nDebezium Engine (the core Java library) and Debezium Server (a stand alone implementation) are pretty different than the Kafka offering. Both with their own performance characteristics, failure modes, and scaling capabilities.\n\nI spun up all three, dug through the code base, and read the docs to get a sense of how they compare. They are each pretty unique flavors of CDC.\n\n|**Attribute**|**Kafka Connect**|**Debezium Server**|**Debezium Engine**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Deployment & architecture**|Runs as source connectors inside a Kafka Connect cluster; inherits Kafka’s distributed tooling|Stand‑alone Quarkus service (JAR or container) that wraps the Engine; one instance per source DB|Java library embedded in your application; no separate service|\n|**Core dependencies**|Kafka brokers + Kafka Connect workers|Java runtime; network to DB & chosen sink—no Kafka required|Whatever your app already uses; just DB connectivity|\n|**Destination support**|Kafka topics only|Built‑in sink adapters for Kinesis, Pulsar, Pub/Sub, Redis Streams, etc.|You write the code—emit events anywhere you like|\n|**Performance profile**|Very high throughput (10 k+ events/s) thanks to Kafka batching and horizontal scaling|Direct path to sink; typically \\~2–3 k events/s, limited by sink & single‑instance resources|DIY - it highly depends on how you configure your application.|\n|**Delivery guarantees**|At‑least‑once by default; optional exactly‑once with  |At‑least‑once; duplicates possible after crash (local offset storage)|At‑least‑once; exactly‑once only if you implement robust offset storage & idempotence|\n|**Ordering guarantees**|Per‑key order preserved via Kafka partitioning|Preserves DB commit order; end‑to‑end order depends on sink (and multi‑thread settings)|Full control—synchronous mode preserves order; async/multi‑thread may require custom logic|\n|**Observability & management**|Rich REST API, JMX/Prometheus metrics, dynamic reconfig, connector status|Basic health endpoint & logs; config changes need restarts; no dynamic API|None out of the box—instrument and manage within your application|\n|**Scaling & fault‑tolerance**|Automatic task rebalancing and failover across worker cluster; add workers to scale|Scale by running more instances; rely on container/orchestration platform for restarts & leader election|DIY—typically one Engine per DB; use distributed locks or your own patterns for failover|\n|**Best fit**|Teams already on Kafka that need enterprise‑grade throughput, tooling, and multi‑tenant CDC|Simple, Kafka‑free pipelines to non‑Kafka sinks where moderate throughput is acceptable|Applications needing tight, in‑process CDC control and willing to build their own ops layer|\n\nDebezium was designed to run on Kafka, which means Debezium Kafka has the best guarantees. When running Server and Engine it does feel like there are some significant, albeit manageable, gaps.\n\n[https://blog.sequinstream.com/the-debezium-trio-comparing-kafka-connect-server-and-engine-run-times/](https://blog.sequinstream.com/the-debezium-trio-comparing-kafka-connect-server-and-engine-run-times/)\n\nCurious to hear how folks are using the less common Debezium Engine / Server and why they went that route?

        "content": "Hi,\n\nWe're advising a client who is just wants to start to establish a centralized ETL orchestration platform — both from a technical and organizational perspective. Currently, they mainly want to run batch job pipelines, and a clear requirement is that the orchestration tool must be self-hosted on Kubernetes AND OSS.\n\nMy initial thought was to go with Apache Airflow, but the growing ecosystem of \"next-gen\" tools (e.g. Dagster, Prefect, Mage, Windmill etc.) makes it hard to keep track of the trade-offs.\n\nAt the moment, I tend towards either Airflow or Dagster to get somehow started..\n\nMy key questions:\n\n* What are the meaningful pros and cons of Airflow vs. Dagster in real-world deployments?\n* One key thing could also be that the client wants this platform useable by different teams and therefore a good Multi-tenancy setup would be helpful. Here I see that Airflow has disadvantges compared to most of \"next-gen\" tools like Dagster? Do you agree/disagree?\n* Are there technical or organizational arguments for preferring one over the other?\n* One thing that bothers me with many Airflow alternatives is that the open-source (self-hosted) version often comes with feature limitations (e.g. multi-tenant support, integrations, or observability e.g. missing audit logs etc.). How has your experience been with this??\n\nAn opinion from experts who built a similar self-hosted setup would therefore be very interesting :)",

I’m using tools I love — GCP, Airflow, Spark, SQL — and have built a strong reputation with my manager, who’s expressed interest in converting me to full-time when the budget allows. The catch? There’s no clear timeline, and I’m expecting my first child later this year, so stability and benefits are becoming a priority.\n\nNow, I’ve been approached with a full-time offer at a smaller company working in healthcare data. The role offers the stability I’m looking for, but the tech stack centers around Microsoft Fabric, which I know is still new and polarizing in the data engineering community. I haven’t worked with Fabric directly, but I understand the concepts (like medallion architecture, data governance, etc.). I’m just not sure if this is the right move for long-term growth — especially since I enjoy hands-on coding and working with more flexible, open tools.\n\nMy questions:\nHas anyone made a similar shift from tools they love to a more rigid/abstracted stack? How did it go?\n\nHow much of a “career risk” is moving into Fabric right now, given it’s still maturing?\n\nWhat would you prioritize in this situation — toolset you love or full-time security (especially with a growing family)?\n\nWhat other factors should I be weighing in this kind of decision?\n\nAppreciate any insights or personal experiences you can share!\n",

        "author": "octolang_miseML",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m an ML Engineer working in a team where ML is new, and I’m collaborating with data engineers who are integrating model predictions into our data warehouse (DWH) for the first time.\n\nWe have a traditional DWH setup with raw, staging, source core, analytics core, and reporting layers. The analytics core is where different data sources are joined and modeled before being exposed to reporting.\n\nOur project involves two text classification models that predict two kinds of categories based on article text and metadata. These articles are often edited, and we might need to track both article versions and historical model predictions, besides of course saving the latest predictions. The predictions are ultimately needed in the reporting layer.\n\nThe data team proposed this workflow:\n\t1.\tAdd a new reporting-ml layer to stage model-ready inputs.\n\t2.\tRun ML models on that data.\n\t3.\tSend predictions back into the raw layer, allowing them to flow up through staging, source core, and analytics core, so that versioning and lineage are handled by the existing DWH logic.\n\nThis feels odd to me — pushing derived data (ML predictions) into the raw layer breaks the idea of it being “raw” external data. It also seems like unnecessary overhead to send predictions through all the layers just to reach reporting. Moreover, the suggestion seems to break the unidirectional flow of the current architecture. Finally, I feel some of these things like prediction versioning could or should be handled by a feature store or similar. \n\nIs this a good approach? What are the best practices for integrating ML predictions into traditional data warehouse architectures — especially when you need versioning and auditability?\n\nWould love advice or examples from folks who’ve done this.",

The problem we have rn is that our older cluster version is very old (19.x.x), and our team could not update it for the past few years. After trying to upgrade the cluster gracefully, we have decided to go against it, and deploy a new cluster, sync the data between these two and then retire the old one. Both clusters are only getting inserts by a set of similar kafka engine tables that are inserting new data into materialized views that populate the inner tables. But the inner table schemas have changed a bit.\n\n  \nI tried clickhouse-backup, but the issue is that the database/metadata have changed, the definition of our tables, zookeeper paths and etc (our previous config had faults). For this issue, we could not also use clickhouse-copier.\n\n  \nI'm currently thinking of writing an ELT pipeline, that reads that from our source clickhouse and writes it to our destination one with some changes. I tried looking up AirByte and DLT, but the guides are mostly about using clickhouse as a sink, not a source.  \n  \nThere is also the option of writing the data to kafka, and consume it on the target cluster from kafka, but I could not find a way to do a full kafka dump using clickhouse. The problem of clickhouse being the sink in most tools/guides is also apparent here\n\nCan anybody help me out? It's been pretty cumbersome as of now.",

        "author": "BlackLands123",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello everyone! 👋\n\nI've recently started a side project using AWS and Python. A core part involves running multiple Lambda functions daily. Each Lambda generates a CSV file based on its specific logic.\n\nSometimes, the CSVs produced by these different Lambdas have data quality issues – things like missing columns, unexpected NaN values, incorrect data types, etc.\n\nBefore storing the data into DynamoDB, I need a process to:\n\n1. Gather the CSV outputs from all the different Lambdas.\n2. Check each CSV against predefined quality standards (correct schema, no forbidden NaN, etc.).\n3. Only process and store the data from CSVs that meet the quality standards. Discard or flag data from invalid CSVs.\n4. Load the cleaned, valid data into DynamoDB.\n\n  \nThis is a side project, so minimizing AWS costs is crucial. Looking for the most budget-friendly approach. Furthermore, the entire project is in Python, so Python-based solutions are ideal. Environment is AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB).\n\n**What's the simplest and most cost-effective AWS architecture/pattern to achieve this?**\n\nI've considered a few ideas, like maybe having all Lambdas dump CSVs into an S3 bucket and then triggering *another* central Lambda to do the validation and DynamoDB loading, but I'm unsure if that's the best way.\n\nLooking for recommendations on services (maybe S3 events, SQS, Step Functions, another Lambda?) and best practices for handling this kind of data validation pipeline on a tight budget.\n\nThanks in advance for your help! :)",

Or do I really just need to set up a bunch of data factory or airbyte jobs to replicate/sync the source down to the dbt target?\n\nAlso, I realize azure sql is not really a columnar storage warehouse platform, this is not TB or barely even GB of data though, so it will probably be alright if we're mindful of writing good code.  And if we needed to move to azure postgres we could, if we had a way to deal simply with getting the source replicated out to somewhere I can run dbt, meaning either cross-database queries, or to a database that allows running DDL statements.\n\nOpen to all ideas and feedback here, it's been a pain to go one by one through all the various azure/ms sql replication services and find that none of them really solves this problem at all.\n\nEdit - data factory may be the way?  Trying to think about how to potentially parameterize something like this docs page is doing so I dint need a copy activity for all 140 or so tables that all need maintained manually.  Some will be ok as full replacements, others will need incremental to stay performant.  I’m just woefully inexperienced with data factory for which I have no excuse   \n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/tutorial-incremental-copy-portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/tutorial-incremental-copy-portal)",

I’ve read it involves creating a new file with the terminal (which I’m not particularly comfortable using). Is there any other way of doing it? Also, what would the consequences of not hiding API keys be and will the rest of the code still be visible to people I share it with?\n\nEdit: thank you for all the comments everyone—they’ve been very helpful and eye opening. As an addendum, here’s my plan to address all the security concerns that have been brought up:\n\n(First, though, I’ve already revoked/made new API keys and haven’t committed them to GitHub, so please don’t worry about that anymore.)\n\n1. I think I’m going to go with GitHub secrets as the most simple way to still have the page functional and secure on pages to share with potential co-ops. Alternatively, I’m going to look into Netlify, which a lot of people have recommended as a simple solution. \n\n2. After that’s done, I’m going to create an alternate version where I use PHPmyAdmin to store the keys and then retrieve them with PHP to showcase doing both (that’s the plan anyways). I’ve avoided PHP since I don’t really understand servers and hosting (haven’t had a class on that yet). Like I don’t know how to make PHP work outside my XAMPP htdocs folder, and it won’t be functional for people I share with (to my knowledge).\n\nAs always, any additional advice would be appreciated, especially if there’s anything wrong with my intended approaches",

        "author": "travel_through_r",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi! I'm new here, so sorry in advance if I broke some rule.\n\nAnyway... During high school, I learned procedural programming (C++), basics of data structures, computer architecture... and as a result, I think I've become somewhat skilled in solving algorithmic tasks.\n\nNow at university, I started with object oriented programming (mostly C++ again) and I think that I understand all the basics (classes and objects, constructors/destructors, fields/methods, inheritance...) while all my professors swear that this approach is far better than procedural programming which I used to do (they mostly cite code reusability and security as reason why).\n\nThe problem is that, even though I already did dozens of, mostly small sized, object oriented programs so far, I still don't see any benefits of it. In fact, it would be easier to me to just make procedural programs while not having to think about object oriented decomposition and stuff like that. Also, so far I haven't see any reason to use inheritance/polymorphism.\n\nThe \"biggest\" project I did until now is assembler that reads contents of a file with assembly commands and translates it to binary code (I created classes Assembler, SymbolTable, Command... but I could have maybe even easier achieve the same result with procedural approach by simply making structures and global functions that work with instances of those structures).\n\nSo, my question is: **can someone explain me in simple terms what are the benefits of object oriented programming and when should I use it?**\n\nTo potentially make things easier to explain and better understand the differences, I even made a small example of a program done with both approaches.\n\nSo, lets say, you need to create a program \"ObjectParser\" where user can choose to parse and save input strings with some predefined form (every string represents one object and its attributes) or to access already parsed one.\n\nNow, let's compare the two paradigms:\n\n**1. Procedural:**\n\n\\- First you would need to define some custom structure to represent object:\n\n    struct Object {\n      // fields\n    }\n\n\\- Since global variables are considered a bad practice, in main method you should create a map to store parsed objects:\n\n    std::map<string, Object> objects;\n\n\\- Then you should create one function to parse a string from a file (user enters name of a file) and one to access an attribute of a saved object (user provides name of the object and name of the attribute)\n\n    void parseString(std::map<string, Object>& objects, std::string filename) {\n      // parsing and storing the string\n    }\n    std::string getValue(std::map<string, Object>& objects, std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) {\n      // retrieving the stored object's attribute\n    }\n\n\\* Notice that you need to pass the map to function since it's not a global object\n\n\\- Then you write the rest of the main method to get user input in a loop (user chooses to either parse new or retrieve saved object)\n\n**2. Object oriented**\n\n\\- First you would create a class called Parser and inside the private section of that class define structure or class called Object (you can also define this class outside, but since we will only be using it inside Parser class it makes sense that it's the integral part of it).\n\nOne of the private fields would be a map of objects and it will have two public methods, one for parsing a new string and one to retrieve an attribute of already saved one.\n\n    class Parser {\n    \n      public:\n        void parseString(std::string filename) {\n          // parsing and storing the string\n        }\n        std::string getValue(std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) {\n          // retrieving the stored object's attribute\n        }\n    \n      private:\n        struct Object {\n          // fields\n          Object(...) {\n            // Object constructor body\n          }\n        }\n        std::map<string, Object> objects;\n    }\n\n\\* Notice that we use default \"empty\" constructor since the custom one is not needed in this case.\n\n\\- Then you need to create a main method which will instantiate the Parser and use than instance to parse strings or retrieve attributes after getting user input the same way as in the procedural example.\n\n**Discussing the example:**\n\nCorrect me if I wrong, but I think that both of these would work and it's how you usually make procedural and object oriented programs respectively.\n\nNow, except for the fact that in the first example you need to pass the  map as an argument (which is only a slight inconvenience) I don't see why the second approach is better, **so if it's easier for you to explain it by using this example or modified version of it, feel free to do it.**\n\n**IMPORTANT**: This is not, by any means, an attempt to belittle object oriented programming or to say that other paradigms are superior. I'm still a beginner, who is trying to grasp its benefits (probably because I'm yet to make any large scale application).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\n**Edit**: Ok, as some of you pointed out, even in my \"procedural\" example I'm using std::string and std::map (internally implemented in OOP manner), so both examples are actually object oriented. \n\nFor the sake of the argument, lets say that instead of std::string I use an array of characters while when it comes to std::map it's an instance of another custom struct and a bunch of functions to modify it (now when I think about it, combining all this into a logical unit \"map\" is an argument in favor of OOP by itself).

I have made my own http server, back end web app type stuff, simple CLI stuff etc. I worked with python briefly and now really only use golang. \n\nI suppose the next step would be learn some front end and start making fully fledged applications/web apps. But it sounds uninteresting to me. I think I am interested in lower level stuff. I started reading \"Modern C\" just for 20-30 mins a day. But I don't want to be that guy thats mediocre at many languages. So I still want to use Go.\n\nI am so lost though, what path do i take if making web apps is uninteresting? I am currently enrolled in math classes, but I need more time (another 6 months) to genuinely use calculus or other more complex math in my programs. E.G. graphics ,rendering, things like that. \n\nPls help , Im feeling lost, but I still like programming. I need some sort of capstone project\n\n",

Later, I discovered Laravel, a PHP framework, and started working on backend development. Over time, I became skilled in Laravel and really enjoyed building applications.\n\nAs I grew, I realized that I needed a deeper understanding of PHP itself, so I took the time to learn PHP as well. I ended up creating the backend for many mobile applications and worked on complex projects. At that time, I was working at a service-based company, so I had to work on whatever came my way. That’s how I also ended up learning Node.js.\n\nYou could say I’m a backend developer who can work with a variety of frameworks like Laravel, Livewire, CakePHP, and Node.js.\n\nCurrently, I’m working at a fintech, product-based company. But here’s the funny part — even after four years of experience, I still feel like something is missing. I’m not sure what to learn next to truly grow. I've never done LeetCode problems, but I’m very good at solving real-world, complex problems that arise during application development.\n\nI also have a basic understanding of low-level languages like C++. But now I’m at a crossroads. Sometimes I feel like I should improve my JavaScript skills and learn React. Other times, I feel drawn toward AI and want to explore how to get better at that.\n\nThere’s a lot of confusion in my mind right now.\n\nI’m 22, and I still love learning and building new things. I genuinely enjoy creating. But I’m unsure what to learn next — something that will help me grow both financially and technically, and truly make me better.\n\nCan you guys please give me some good advice ?",

I then switched careers and spent the next 25 years successfully doing something completely unrelated, writing code only extremely occasionally in essentially \"toy\" environments (e.g., simple Basic code in Excel to automate some processes). \n\nIn the meantime, I sort of missed \"real\" coding, but not enough to switch back careers, and I completely missed all the developments that happened during those 25 years, in terms of tooling, frameworks, etc. Back when I was coding, there was no GitHub, Stack Overflow, Golang, React, cloud, Kubernetes, Microservices, etc., and even Python wasn't really a thing (it existed, but almost nobody was using it seriously in production). \n\nI now have an idea for an exciting (and fairly complex) project, and enough time and flexibility (and fire in the belly) to build it myself - at least the initial version to see if the idea has legs before involving other people. Haven't had such an itch to code in 25 years :) So my question is - what is the fastest and most efficient way to learn the modern \"developer stack\" and current frameworks, both to start building quickly and at the same time make sure that whatever I do is consistent with modern best practices and available frameworks? The project will involve a big database on the backend, with a Web client on the frontend, and whatever is available through the Web client would also need to be available via an API. For the initial version, of course I don't need it to support many requests at the same time, but I do want to architect it in a way that it could potentially support a huge number of concurrent requests/be essentially infinitely scalable. \n\nI'm not sure where to start \"catching up\" on the entire stack - from tools like Cursor and GitHub to Web frameworks like React to backend stuff - and I am also a bit worried that there are things \"I don't know that I don't know\" (with the things I mentioned, at least I know they exist and roughly understand what they do, but I am worried about \"blind spots\" I may have). There is of course a huge amount of material online, but most of what I found is either super specific and assumes a lot of background knowledge about that particular technology, OR the opposite, it assumes no knowledge of programming at all, and starts out with \"for\" loops and such and moves painfully slowly. I would very much appreciate any suggestions on the above (or any parts of the above) that would help me catch up quickly (obviously not to the expert level on any of these, but to a \"workable\" one) and start building.

Like can’t “code” or think like a programmer. \n\nAnd beyond that I am struggling to start projects because I keep getting anxious if this is the right thing to do. I feel like I can’t make inefficient moves right now so I have this fear that whatever project I am doing could be a waste of time. Maybe there is a project that utilizes a different library that I need, or a framework I need to use. Or some AI tool I need to familiarize myself with. There’s just so much stuff out there I get anxious thinking if this project is the “right” one to help me land an internship. \n\nI feel woefully inadequate and feel like a fucking failure at this. I honestly don’t understand why it’s so difficult for me. Like I don’t fucking get it. \n\nWhat do I do. I feel like everyone is moving forward and I am just falling behind. \n\nThe projects I have in mind are:\n\n1. A website to track grocery items from various stores. \n\n2. A fallout 4 hacking minigame (website or app)\n\n3. And a script for my current part time job to make my work more efficient/automated. Helping with organizing some data from excel. \n\nAre these decent projects? Like I feel like they’re too basic and I don’t know what to do. I am afraid to make a move on any of this because I feel like it may be a waste of time or if there is a framework/library/tool I should be using instead in a different project to help make me more marketable.

I’m the only one in the company working with .NET. The rest of the team is made up of front-end devs and software testers—no other back-end devs, no senior .NET people, no real mentorship or guidance.\n\nBasically, I’m on my own. And while I’ve done a lot of self-learning to get to this point, I’m honestly tired of doing it all by myself. I’m worried that working solo like this for 1–2 years will limit my growth. I won’t have anyone to learn best practices from, no code reviews, no exposure to how real teams handle things.\n\nI’m afraid I’ll waste this time and come out of it stuck, with not much to show for it.\n\nAnyone been in a similar situation? Is there a way to actually grow in a job like this, or should I already be planning my next move?",

        "content": "I'm 38 years old and started my education back in 2005.  Due to POOR life choices, I dropped out after my third semester.  I recently got back into programming and I've been learning for a few years now.  I'm about to start my 3rd year of my Computer Science major.  I have ADHD... really bad ADHD.  Obviously, I'm medicated now, and that helps.  My problem is trying to remember proper syntax.  I can code just fine.  Passed all my classes so far.  Worked with C++, C#, Java, HTML, and CSS without issues EXCEPT I cannot remember proper syntax for the life of me.  I know what I need to do.  I know how to get there.  I just can't ever remember code syntax and structure.  Going from C++ to C# was especialy frustrating.  I can't tell you how many times I wrote Console.PrintLine() instead of Console.WriteLine(). I constantly have to have a reference open on my computer to help me remember syntax.  Here's an example:  Lets say I'm building a class.  I would need to have something like this open to help me remember syntax: \n\npublic class MediaItem { \n\n// Properties common to all media items \n\npublic string Title \n\n{ get; set; } \n\npublic int PublicationYear \n\n{ get; set; } \n\n// Constructor for the base class public \n\nMediaItem(string title, int publicationYear) \n\n{ \n\nTitle = title; PublicationYear = publicationYear; Console.WriteLine(\"MediaItem constructor called.\"); } \n\n// A virtual method that can be overridden by derived classes \n\npublic virtual void DisplayInfo() \n\n{ \n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Title: {Title}\"); Console.WriteLine($\"Publication Year: {PublicationYear}\"); \n\n}\n\nI would need to have this open in OneNote so I can reference because my memory is so terrible.  Is this a bad practice?  Is this a normal problem?  Obviously, I know it will get better with repetition, but it is very frustrating.  ",

I’ve been doing the lectures, exercises, notes, and even tried managing my focus with ADHD meds—but it still feels like every time I make progress, something new drops and I get thrown right back into confusion. Loops, functions, arrays, objects… I keep thinking I get it, and then I don’t.\n\nI’m not here to complain—I’m here because I actually want to get better. I want to know if this is a normal part of the learning curve, or if maybe I’m just not wired for this kind of logic.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of people talk about how it “clicks eventually”—I’m wondering when and how that happens.\nIf you’ve ever struggled with this and pushed through, how did you do it?\nDid you use specific tools, resources, or ways of thinking that helped make it all make sense?\n\nI’m open to any advice, encouragement, or even stories about how others got through this phase. Just please—no condescending lectures. I’m not looking for superiority contests. Just real talk from real people who’ve been there.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: Also, SO sorry about the weird username. I just noticed that’s what it was. I hardly ever use Reddit. I made this account back when I was really big into playing Cyberpunk 2077, and it was a reference to something Adam Smasher said. 😅😬😵‍💫",

So. there are a lot of options on DSA, excited to learn all this.\n\nAfter that or while doing the DSA course I plan on completing, leetcode questions, this practice section on geeksforgeeks  \n [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions&itm\\_source=geeksforgeeks&itm\\_medium=main\\_header&itm\\_campaign=practice\\_header](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&sortBy=submissions&itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=main_header&itm_campaign=practice_header)  \nand this course by neetcode offering on freecodecamp which is the top 150 asked questions for interviewers?  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0u5nwSA0w0&ab\\_channel=freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0u5nwSA0w0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)\n\nThe problem that I am facing right now is that all this is for data science and ai I believe that Python is for, and I can use frameworks? I don't really understand it all very well. But my end goal is to create applications that can help give me streams of income. I understand what you will say that coding shouldn't be about the money, but I am genuinely interested in learning all the crevices of this large iceberg. I picked this route because it seemed to be a good starting point with a good roadmap. But as I started to go deeper there was just so much information that I really don't even know where to begin. Learned something about SQL, Flask, Tailwind CSS?   \n  \nThe source of inspiration for all this was this video by stoneycodes  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvO88XxNAzs&ab\\_channel=stoneycodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvO88XxNAzs&ab_channel=stoneycodes)  \nAnyway is this a good starting point? Like I said the end goal is to be able to create apps that I believe will make peoples lives easier. I've loving programming for a couple years now but a recent epiphany made me realize that if you want something you gotta go get it! Stop waiting for it. create your own luck if you want to say. Currently the python course by jose padilla, is frying my brain, the practice problems make my brain stop working. I don't know.. Some advice is appreciated it you're willing to share. Thank you have a blessed day! \n\n  \nP.S \n\nsorry for spelling errors :o",

I have made solid progress and feel confident in my luau skills, however It really does not matter much as Luau is one of the easiest programming languages, and even then I sometimes struggle with it, looking at other more advanced individuals code or talk about coding makes me feel like that's not the field for me, I mean I admire them a lot and would really like get on their levels but it also makes me feel really stupid... I might be wrong tho, maybe this is like saying an English speaker can't be fluent in french just cause he gets confused hearing people speak french , although he did not even bother learning the language first(I think that's a decent analogy lol) so if you are someone really into programming, did it feel the same getting into programming?",

My focus is on mastering both core CS concepts and practical skills. I want a clear, efficient roadmap that covers fundamental topics, hands-on coding, and system design — essentially the skills expected in a CS job, even if I don't plan to apply for one.  \n\nHere's my current plan:  \n\n1. Core CS Fundamentals: Study algorithms, data structures, operating systems, networks, databases, and computer architecture.  \n2. Programming Proficiency: Deeply learn one or two programming languages (considering Python and JavaScript/TypeScript).  \n3. Project Development: Build real-world applications (web and backend) and contribute to open-source projects.  \n4. System Design: Learn scalable architecture principles, database management, and cloud deployment.  \n\nI'll use a mix of free online courses (like CS50, MIT OCW, The Odin Project, and freeCodeCamp) alongside other online resources.  \n\n### My Questions:\n- Is this roadmap practical? What changes or additions would you recommend?\n- What are the best, up-to-date resources for self-learning computer science (e.g., YouTube channels, blogs, creators, platforms)?\n- Given the current trends of vibe coding, what can self-learners prioritize or skip?\n- Any vibe coding tools to recommend?\n- What common mistakes should self-learners in CS avoid?\n\nI'd love to hear from anyone who has successfully self-studied CS or has experience in the field.

Looking at job security, it seems that .NET is a pretty good gamble.\n\nSo for those of you working in the field:\n\n* What back-end tools, frameworks, or skills should I be learning alongside .NET to be job-ready? Things I've read about are Entity Framework Core, DTOs, Repository Pattern etc.\n* Are there databases, authentication tools, or cloud services that companies expect you to know?\n* Any tips for someone coming from the front-end world and transitioning to .NET?\n\nAppreciate any insight here - I'd love to hear what things I need to learn that'd make me most marketable.\n\nThanks!",

Not necessarily an amazing offer in his words, but something. In the 2000s, he said it was a bit more competitive, but could land an offer for every 10 applications. \n\nEven in 2015, I found I could apply to 20 or 30 jobs and be relatively confident in getting an offer. Assuming I wasn't stretching myself, most jobs I was applied for I would get an interview for, even if we determined it wasn't a good fit.\n\nBut now I am regularly seeing people say you need to submit 100s to 1000s of applications to get a job. & applying to 100 jobs without getting past the screener.\n\nI feel like the ladder has been pulled up & the hiring process has become fully kafkaesque. its a regular refrain here now that you can be the best applicant for the role and be filtered out by the ATS, it depends on your luck. this system seems designed to abuse people seeking work rather than find the best applicant. \n\nFor those of us who can take advantage of our professional networks, we might still find we only need to have 20 or 30 conversations with people to land our next role. Since we can get referrals or speak directly to hiring managers out of band.\n\nBut every publicly posted job getting +1000 applicants. If things continue at this rate we will soon see people saying we will need 10,000 or 100,000 job applications submitted in order to land a role. I don't know what the solution is but this just doesn't make sense and seems completely awful. turning the job market into a casino isn't helping employees or employers.",

I said, “That works, I’m looking for something above $150K.” I think this was my first mistake, more on that later.\n\nI am a person with low self esteem(or serious imposter syndrome) and when I say I nailed all 8 rounds, I really must believe that. The recruiter followed up the day after 8th round saying team is interested in extending an offer. Then on compensation expectations the recruiter said, “You mentioned $150K earlier.” I clarified that I was targeting the upper end based on my fit and experience. They responded with, “So $180K?” and I just said yes. It felt a bit like putting words in my mouth.\n\nNext day, I got an email saying that I have to wait for the offer decision as they are interviewing  other candidates. Haven’t heard back since. I don’t think I did anything fundamentally wrong or if I should have regrets but curious what others think.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, in my mind I thought that’s how negotiations work.

However, I can’t help but notice how many people are not really doing what it takes, even in good market, to secure a decent job (ignore 2021-2022, those were anomalously good years, and likely won’t happen again in the near future).\n\n\nWhat I’ve seen:\n\n1. Not searching for internships the summer/fall *before* the summer you want to intern.  I literally had someone ask me IRL a few days ago, about my company’s intern program that literally starts next week…. They were focusing on schoolwork apparently in their fall semester , and started looking in the spring.\n\n2. Not applying for new grad roles in the same timeline as above.  Why did you wait to graduate before you seriously started the job search?  \n\n3.  Not having projects on your resume (assuming no work xp) because you haven’t taken the right classes yet or some other excuse.  Seriously?\n\n4.  Applying to like 100 roles online, and thinking there’s enough.  I went to a top target, and I sent over 1000 apps, attended so many in-person and virtual events, cold DMed people on LinkedIn for informational interviews starting my freshman year.  I’m seeing folks who don’t have the benefit of a target school name literally doing less.\n\n5.  Missing scheduled calls, show up late, not do basic stuff.  I had a student schedule an info interview with me, no show, apologize, reschedule, and no show again.   I’ve had others who had reached out for a coffee chat, not even review my LinkedIn profile and ask questions like where I worked before.  Seriously?\n\n6.  Can’t code your way out of a box.  Yes, a wild amount of folks can’t implement something like a basic binary search.\n\n7.  Cheat on interviews with AI.  It’s so common.\n\n8.  Not have basic knowledge/understanding (for specific roles).  You’d be surprised how many candidates in AI/ML literally don’t know the difference between inference and training, or can’t even half-explain the bias-variance trade-off problem.\n\n\nDo the basic stuff right, and you’re already ahead of 95% of candidates.\n\n",

        "author": "megariffs",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "If you work at a company that uses old tech stacks and processes, try not to stay at that company for too long (unless they are transitioning to using a newer tech stack and processes) because when it's time to work at another company, your lack of experience in newer tech and processes may come back and bite you. They're good to gain professional experience but after a couple of years, you should try and find another job that's more in line with what industry is going towards\n\nWhen I graduated from college in 2016, my first job was a full-stack developer at a company I was working at while I was in college doing completely different work. I became their first in-house developer after I developed their Intranet site (as an internship project for my university) and redesigned their one of their customer referral forms. Their tech stack at the time was [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms for their customer portal and VB6 for the application that their employees used.\n\nAfter getting an opportunity to work at a startup that my former boss help start in 2022, I quit my then current job to work there. Less than a year later, I was let go due to \"inexperience\" even though I've done all my tasks on time, quickly learned React (the company initially was using [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms as a proof of concept before switching to React and [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core Web API), and I was receiving good reviews from my manager a month earlier. I believe I was scapegoated because the team itself was under performing, but I digress. With that being said, I learned quite a bit before I was let go. My first employer never used GitHub/Azure/etc, so I was unfamiliar with committing code, branch concepts, creating a PR, etc. I was also unfamiliar with newer [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) concepts like Dependency Injections, Program.cs, Middleware, etc that were in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core. Working at the startup exposed me to all of that.\n\nLuckily, I was able to find another job (which paid even more money) in less than 3 months. It was another company that used [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms for one of their applications and a mixture of [VB.NET/VB6](http://VB.NET/VB6) for another application. Fast forward to last month (April 3rd 2025), my position was eliminated. Therefore, I got laid off due to the company restructuring after having a bad financial outcome from the previous year. This time around, I wasn't let go due to performance. In fact, they emphatically praised me for being a great developer. My boss's boss emailed me afterwards to let me know that I can use him as a reference for another job and he'll reach out to contacts to see if anyone of them are looking for a developer to hire.\n\nWithin the last several weeks, I was able to get an interview at 3 companies (2 contract jobs and one  \ndirect to hire). This week, I made it to the second round of one company before they decided to go in another direction. They told my recruiter that my in-person interview was excellent but another candidate  they interviewed had more experience, so they decided to go with the other candidate. This time around,  \nthe companies I worked at previously never used automated testing, Microservices, CI/CD pipelines, service bus technology, etc. I felt like my lack of experience using those concepts came back and bit me.\n\nRegarding the two other companies, I did make it to the third round of the direct to hire job, but I'm  \nafraid that my lack of experience using .NET based service bus tech and potentially other tech may get in the way of me landing this job. I'm going to spending the entire week brushing up on those concepts before my final interview. I did get a job offer from the first company I interviewed at, but I'm hesitant to work there because it's only 3 month contract, it's a long commute to another state (40-45 min drive), and they want me to use React. I haven't used React in over a year.\n\nTLDR; Don't be like me and stick around at a company for too long that uses old tech stacks and processes or not spending enough time to learn newer tech. Granted, I tried to do that at times, but I have a newborn now. Also, my partner can be quite needy and wants to spend a lot of time with me. We've got into arguments in the past over me wanting to spend time after work to work on projects to develop new skills.\n\nEdit: Grammar\n\n \n\n ",

Then, they’ll list this as an internship on their see bee or LinkedIn page.\n\nInteresting, to be honest I interned at some large companies but basically did data entry and a very small amount of development work, but I of course listed it as “web developer intern using React” when React was maybe like 15% of the job, so I’m not hating on these guys. But my work was at “real” companies with thousands of employees so is actually verifiable, I’m curious as to if this strategy by students works.

It's not sustainable, I do want to go back into film but it's been 2 years later with only a few side gigs worked here and there as a production assistant.  (mostly because I haven't pursued anything because of financial hardship and the steady pay is worth more to me than random amounts of 1099 based pay here and there)\n\nOn a whim, I decided to have Amazon pay me to learn how to drive a truck ( semi-drivers are also needed in film too) and at the time it just seemed to be a good thing to fall back on and I day dreamed about getting to travel again and get paid to do it.\n\nThat said, I kind of don't want to see myself as a trucker for life ( as funny as an idea that was at the time as a way to get out of back breaking labor)\n\nI was from a generation that was always told learn to code ect....

I have zero interest to be a blue \"collar\" worker, and I need an extra set of skills if working BTS isn't a viable long term career (its not)\n\nI just want that desk job and that 80-100k a year.

I had a discussion with a colleague who is debating on starting up a company to do just that - paying low comp for new grads or terminally unemployed software engineers. ",

        "content": "Hi all,\nI just received an offer from a FAANG company in the Bay Area on a team that aligns perfectly with my long-term technical career goals. It’s a dream job.\n\nMy partner just got their dream (non-tech) offer here on the East Coast (not in a major tech hub), where we currently live and have built a great community. They could possibly find a similar role in the Bay Area, and are totally open to that. I could also potentially find a solid remote role if we stayed.\n\nWe’re trying to balance the career benefits of joining FAANG on a team I would love against staying somewhere where we’re both really happy and have roots we’ve formed over the past three years.\n\nI could use some advice on:\n\n1. How much long-term value does a FAANG role really add to your resume and career growth? Is the FAANG name and learning actually that impactful on your career? (I think it is but could use perspectives)\n\n2. Do you think the payoff could be worth uprooting our lives on the East coast? \n\n3. How many years of experience at FAANG really makes a difference on your resume and your learning? It’s easier for us to consider moving for just a few years, and then coming back East. And hoping that the FAANG experience would open up a lot of opportunities and flexibility. \n\nThank you in advance!\n",

I got my current and first job because I was cheap (my starting pay was far below market rate for SE1 role), and the hiring manager was impressed with a systems programming and os architecture project I had on my resume and my github from one of my classes which was written in C. My job uses a techstack of syncfusion c# winform frontend and an old C backend that was originally written before I was even born.\n\nI've been spending my free time upskilling, mostly working with .net core & react, and python as I'd like to get a full stack or backend role with a more modern and common techstack. But problem is, every job I've applied to that uses anything remotely modern hasn't given me any call backs. The only jobs I have heard from are ones that I didn't even apply to that want the same thing as my current job does, a cheap junior that knows C.\n\nI'm guessing part of the reason why I'm not getting callbacks is not just because of how bad the market is, but because in a recruiters and hiring manager's mind, why take a chance on someone who currently works with something arachic, when you can just get someone who has actual job experience in what they use. How do I get out of being pigeonholed? I tailor my resume to the job I apply to as best I can, but it's not like I can rewrite the experience section of my resume that shows I deal with winforms and C.",

        "content": "For a long time, I’ve been obsessed with prestige and what people think of me. Only recently have I started to realize that this focus has been damaging.\n\nBack in college, I struggled to land strong internships. When people asked where I interned, I’d feel insecure.\n\nThis past new grad job hunt season was different. I did extremely well. But instead of simply feeling proud, I found myself bringing it up in almost every conversation — how many offers I got, how hard the decision was. My close friends pointed out that my conversations shifted away from hobbies and life to career decisions, leveling systems, and growth.\n\nWhen it came time to choose between job offers, I tried everything to make the “right” decision. I asked all my friends and family. I read every blog and polled every possible forum. I was obsessed with finding the most validated, socially acceptable path — the one society would approve of. Obviously it didn’t work. \n\nEventually, I had to ask myself: *Why do I feel the need to share my successes so often? Why is this decision so agonizing?* And I think the honest answer is that I care a lot about how others perceive me.\n\nBut digging deeper, that desire doesn’t feel purely ego-driven. In tech, **career advancement almost entirely depends on perception.** Recruiters scan for brand names. Managers reward visibility. Friends decide whether you’re worth a referral. Your market worth is defined by what others think, not by what you think you’re worth.\n\nThat’s why I find myself highlighting my accomplishments and leaning toward prestige. I want to be seen as someone worth helping, worth investing in. I want future recruiters to see my resume and not hesitate. But in the process, I’ve started to value prestige more than my own long-term goals and personal values.\n\nChoosing between offers this season was especially hard because they represented opposite sides of this internal conflict — one path aligned with prestige, the other with personal fit.\n\nConventional advice says to “stop caring what people think.” But is that even realistic when almost every system in tech (and the world in general) is based on what others think of you and how you're ranked?",

I've chalked up this difference to the stock options I receive being illiquid but even if we hit our goal IPO valuation (likely as we have a billionaire angel investor but it may take years) I'd be barely ahead of them in terms of total pay over the 5+ years of our overall career, while also having taken on far more risk. \n\nI'm considering attempting to make the jump into a bigger company to get some more upward growth options. The problem is that I hear the market is super competitive now so I'm not sure if its worth investing the time into getting back into interview shape. I'm also worried about burnout, since I am fully remote here and usually only go in-office twice a week for food. Big companies seem to be hard pushing RTO and I would miss being able to take work-cations around the world.\n\nWith all that being said, do you guys think its the right career move to make the jump? I've been here since graduating almost 5 years ago and am starting to feel a bit stagnant. It's like golden handcuffs except instead of good TC the carrot is just a relaxed schedule and remote option which seems to be dwindling.

        "content": "***Disclaimer: This post is not about me but a friend of mine. That nevertheless doesn't invalidate the seriousness of the situation. There’s a TL;DR at the end if you need it.***\n\n\nI've been working as a software engineer at my current company for about 2 years. From the very beginning, I disclosed that I have SLE lupus (an autoimmune condition), which means I’m constantly on anticoagulant medication. I also have a physical disability that makes daily commuting difficult.\n\n\nThankfully, things were manageable for a long time—my role allowed for hybrid work, with some days in-office and others WFH. That balance helped me stay productive and committed despite my health challenges.\n\n\nBut everything started shifting this year.\n\n\nThe company is preparing to go public and has been carrying out silent layoffs—mostly through performance improvement plans (PIPs). WFH flexibility has been dialed back, and there's increasing pressure to be in-office regularly. I complied with the new expectations despite the strain, kept putting in the hours, met all deadlines, and consistently received positive feedback.\n\nHowever, over the past couple of weeks, my health has taken a serious turn. I’ve developed gangrene in my left index finger—there’s a chance I could lose it, or even more fingers if it spreads. I was terrified to ask for leave, hoping things would heal. I kept working—coding one-handed with my right hand—just to avoid raising red flags.\n\n\nThen two days ago, I was blindsided.\n\n\nMy manager scheduled a recorded meeting and placed me on a PIP, claiming I had negative feedback from past team leads. This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager. After the meeting, my manager called me privately, off the record. He implied that he had no real control over the situation and gently suggested I start looking for a new role while going through the PIP.\n\n\nSo here I am—on a one-month PIP, with a two-month notice period after that if things don’t improve.\n\n\nAnd now my health is at a breaking point. I need time off, but I can’t afford to lose this job. My medical expenses are piling up fast. If I lose this income, I’ll probably have to leave my apartment and move back in with my parents, who are already under financial strain.\n\nI need advice. Please.\n* Should I try explaining the full extent of my condition to HR or management again and ask to pause the PIP or adjust expectations?\n* Should I ask for a quiet exit now with some kind of severance instead of going through a likely-failed PIP?\n* Has anyone faced something similar—being disabled and seriously ill while also under pressure to perform or leave?\n\nPlease don’t just say “prioritize your health and quit”—I wish I could, but I don’t have that privilege. I'm trying to survive, not just live. Any practical advice or shared experiences would really mean a lot right now.\n\n**TL;DR:**    \n**Software engineer with lupus + physical disability. Was managing well with hybrid work until company began silent layoffs via PIPs. Now being forced into WFO, health has worsened (developed gangrene in hand), but afraid to take leave. Just put on a PIP despite positive past feedback. Manager privately suggested I start job hunting. Can't afford to lose job due to high medical costs. Looking for advice on whether to fight the PIP, talk to HR, or ask for severance.**",

I’ve been applying for dev jobs ever since but haven’t been able to land a single proper interview. I didn’t do any internships because I didn’t know the job market would be this bad which I regret right now. I couldn’t afford to sit around waiting, so I’ve been working full-time in sales to pay the bills which makes it a bit harder for me since I don’t have a lot of free time to focus on job hunting and building projects.\n\nThat said, I didn’t give up on tech. I’ve been learning on my own, building personal projects whenever I have a bit of free time, and I’ve also worked with a small agency on a project basis (not full-time) since late 2023.\n\nAt this point I’m honestly burnt out and confused. Is it my resume? My background? Is the market just that bad? I’d really appreciate any advice or feedback, especially from anyone who broke in after a similar detour.",

        "author": "Accipitrim",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi folks, I'm a junior dev currently a year into their first job at a well-known tech company (non-FAANG) in the bay.\n\n**((This part is  just me ranting so you can just skip to the bottom to read my questions))**\n\nI know I should be grateful to have a job in this economy, but I am absolutely miserable at work due to various factors (uninteresting work, long hours, toxic team, micromanaging etc.) and I feel that I've hit the lowest point of my mental and physical health. I've lost at least 15 lbs due to lack of appetite from stress. Everyone in my team works \\~50 hours every week. Maybe these aren't \"crazy\" hours, but I joined the company expecting a regular 40 hour work week, so I was unpleasantly surprised. I used to be of the mindset that I just needed to work my 9-5 and leave,  but my manager actually reprimanded me specifically for not working long enough hours and being slow on my tasks only couple months into the job. I'd say this is when I started becoming very unhappy at my job as I became extremely anxious about my work hours and performances afterwards.\n\nAll of my coworkers are much *much* older than me. And while most people have been pleasant to work with, I have also been thrown under the bus by my manager over a minor issue that was not my fault because one of the senior members of the team took a disliking of me. This happened \\~5 months into the job. I'd say I'm on good terms with everyone now, but this left a very sour taste in my mouth. Also, the vast majority of my team consists of first-gen immigrants who speak to each other in a foreign language that I do not understand at work. This, combined with the fact that I'm the only junior in my team, makes me feel very out of place.\n\nI still plan on staying here for at least for a year so that I could keep my sign-on, but I flirt with the idea of quitting without any backup plan if it comes to that, though I likely never will given the state of the economy (alternatively, get hit by a car on the way to work). The pay is on the lower end of the average for the bay area and I also got a rather low annual raise, which has been one of the final straws for me.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\nI know that the biggest issue right now is that the job market for any entry level SWE is very saturated. However, I'm also a bit confused on how to start applying for jobs as someone with a full-time work experience:\n\n* Which roles do I even apply for? Should I still be applying to New Grad roles? I've heard that 1 YOE is not much different from New Grad. Based on what I have seen, most job postings have been only for mid to senior level roles. There doesn't seem to be many entry level roles that are posted year round. A lot of generic SWE roles still require 2 to 3+ YOE in the description. Should I still shoot my shot regardless? Or would it just be a waste of time?\n* Is it okay for my resume to be similar to what I had from college (ie. work experience, college projects, and engineering-related extracurriculars) with just the addition of my work as a full time engineer?\n* If I switch jobs before my first promotion at the company, would this set me back a year in terms of promotion? But to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll even get promoted in this team since my manger seems to have a bad impression of me.",

I've had a really tough time finding a good job. I'm frankly exhausted and not totally sure if it's just time to pivot to management, or what.\n\nI've got an offer from a solid startup -  (70 employees, obfuscated because I really don't want them to see this) with good for a good salary (220-250k?) and equity, in-office. It's not a bad commute, and I could probably do good work, but it's a JavaScript shop, even on the data platform side. The code is messy as hell. The deadlines are yesterday, according to glassdoor. Not at all my forte or favorite. They need someone to work on their data platform to make it scalable and performant. It touches AI/ML, but it's scrappy and there's lots of fires to put out.\n\nI've got another offer that's contract with **possibility** of conversion at D1sney building an observability for their streaming platform, and it's more like 170K. It's got a lot of visibility, and I'd be somewhat insulated because it's a big fucking company. I'd get to work in Scala, which is a joy and not easy to find.\n\nI'm torn. I'm getting back on the horse after a pretty bad series of uncomfortable startup experiences that ended with a lot of burnout, and the idea of going into the office every day for visibility is a lot. Hell, I'm not even sure if I want to be a software engineer.\n\nD would give me more flexibility and less pressure but it does seem like a cool project. I could pretty much take it and run with it and do some cool stuff. I'm friendly and personable.\n\nI'm just trying to get back on my feet after being out of the game for about a year. I'm not sure how ready I am to hit the ground running at a startup, and I'm not sure if it's just my lack of confidence. The flexibility of in-office when I want to be is huge, but am I daft for leaning toward contract work at a big entity with the possibility of conversion for less money, considering the reality of the grind?\n\nI don't want to burn out, but I want to make sure I'm in a good place if this contract ends. Should I get the offer from the startup? I can't really use it to leverage more from D because it's through a third party, and sanity and sustainability are my big drivers. And yeah, being able to do Scala makes me happy.\n\nThoughts?",

Most of my work has been tied to school projects, so my portfolio isn’t as strong as I’d like.\n\nWhile I don’t consider myself the best or smartest (sometimes I feel the exact opposite), I’ve always been quick to understand things. I’m good at breaking down complex problems, and I’ve received praise for it my entire life. However, discipline has always been a challenge for me. I’ve managed to get by relying on my intellect while doing far less work than I should have. But recently, I’ve started implementing good routines and becoming productive every day.\n\nI’m an international student in the U.S., working toward my master’s in Math with a concentration in Computer Science, and my bachelor’s degree was also in CS. All I need to do to graduate is submit my thesis. The pressure is mounting because my time to stay in the country is running out unless I secure a job soon. I’m actually being forced to start using my OPT (limited work eligibility) time to submit my thesis by December and graduate.\n\nI feel overwhelmed trying to figure out how to compete in the job market despite these challenges. For reference, I’m currently near Houston, Texas. So far, I’ve applied to fewer than 50 jobs. Most of the time, I don’t get responses - sometimes I get rejections - but I’ve never had an interview.\n\nFor those who have been in similar situations - or those who’ve successfully transitioned into a career without much experience - how did you do it? Can I make my school projects look more compelling to employers? Will they even look at them? Do I have a chance?\n\nI know that if I’m given an opportunity in a work environment, I’ll reach a high-performance level very quickly. I just don’t know how to show this potential to employers. I also can’t seem to get my resume under two pages.\n\nAny advice on networking (which I’ve struggled with as an introvert with few close friends), skill-building, or navigating job searches efficiently would be incredibly helpful.\n\nFinally, thank you whoever you are for taking the time to read this. I’m crossing my fingers for something that gives me hope - that I haven’t completely wasted my life and opportunity here. In the meantime, I'm making small victories, like finally maintaining a steady routine of working on my thesis and working on my resume/linkedIn/applying for jobs full-time.",

        "author": "Wonderful_Analyst_50",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I graduated college with a bachelors degree in computer science a while ago and ever since I’ve been living with my parents while doing delivery services like Instacart and uber eats to make money while I try to search for a job as a software engineer. As you can guess I haven’t really gotten anywhere with that. I even attended a software engineering bootcamp last year to try to bolster my resume (may not have been the smartest idea in hindsight but I enjoyed it and met some cool people so I don’t regret it) but still nothing. \n\nMy family is now trying to push me to apply for a masters program focusing on something like cybersecurity or biotech (which feels a little outside my comfort zone as I wasn’t great at biology) claiming the masters is the final piece I need to make it all come together. Honestly the thought of putting so much more time and money into a field that has had fruitless returns so far gives me a ton of anxiety and I don’t want to come out the other side of it multiple years from now tens of thousands of dollars in debt and be in the same position I’m in now. I was lucky enough that I could get my bachelors degree mostly for free due to my father’s VA benefits but I’d be too old to qualify for that once I get into a masters program so I’d be paying full price this time around. I also burned out pretty hard towards the end of my bachelors (partially due to Covid) and pretty much dragged myself across the finish line so the thought of going back after a few years away is pretty daunting.\n\nUltimately though I know I need to do something and I’m sick and tired of the position I’m in. I feel like I’ve put my life on hold for years trying to start it from the best position possible and I’m at a point where it just doesn’t feel viable anymore. Living with my parents for this long just doing deliveries and job applications every day has made me pretty depressed and I kind of just want to get a regular non-tech job, move out into an apartment with a friend, and figure out my life from there. At the same time though I feel like if a masters degree would genuinely be very useful in the long run, I’m being short sighted and years from now I’d regret not getting it. Especially considering my parents are willing to keep housing me while I go back to school so I’d probably be making my life more difficult by moving out instead, even if it would probably improve my mental health.\n\nI do genuinely enjoy coding and would consider myself pretty good at it, but I wouldn’t say I’m passionate about it or anything. I don’t really feel passionate about anything really, I kinda just want to have a good life making comfortable money and not hating my job. When I changed my major to computer science it seemed like a pretty straight shot, I enjoyed it more than my other classes, I was naturally very good at it, and there seemed to be a pretty direct path of internship (check) -> degree (check) -> high paying job (crash and burn). The market crash happened right before I graduated so I found it to be extremely unlucky timing and have pretty much been trying to play catch up ever since.\n\nBasically I’m just looking to see if anyone has any thoughts on the usefulness of a masters degree in the current market and if it would be a good use of my time and money or not. Or maybe even if there’s any CS related jobs I could get with my current degree that I may have overlooked so far (I’ve mainly been focusing on full stack development). Any advice is very appreciated.\n\n\nTLDR: I’m wondering if a masters degree is worth the time and money in this current tech market or if there are any other type of CS jobs I could get with my bachelors that are commonly overlooked. Or should I just cut my losses, find a non-tech job, move into an apartment with a friend, and try to figure out my life from there.",

After that, I have 4 years of experience in an IT Consulting firm - my job title said \"Consultant.\" I mostly worked on production support (incident management and bug fixes) for client projects, primarily on the backend which for the most part, involved a Java-based low code integration development platform and Oracle DB/SQL on the database side. Occasionally, I would use Core Java as and when needed. I also got familiar with version control and CICD concepts.\n\n\n\nWhile working on this job, I had been parallelly doing a lot of self learning on fundamental CS topics like Data Structures, Algorithm design and analysis. I eventually left to pursue a Master's in Computer Science where I am currently enrolled. Today, an Amazon recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn to set up an SDE-2 interview. I have been practicing LeetCode and intend to complete at least the Neetcode 150 and Blind 75 in the coming days. My Master's coursework has involved a lot of Low Level Design/Object Oriented Design Patterns and I have been learning High Level System Design from online lecture videos.\n\n\n\nHowever, I am not sure if my earlier work experience makes me suitable for an SDE-2 role at Amazon. I haven't really done any significant System Design in my previous role and I am not sure how to deal with the Behavioral/Leadership Principles based rounds where they question you about your earlier work experiences.\n\n\n\nAs I'll be graduating from an MSCS program soon, should I ask the recruiter for an SDE-1 role instead? I'm not sure if she even recruits for SDE-1 and it's not clear if down leveling to SDE-1, in case I meet the SDE-1 bar but not the SDE-2 one, after the interview is an option. I would greatly appreciate any insights on what is advisable given my background. Thank you!",
