Stuff like SELECT \\* or SELECT TOP 7,000,000 \\* with a list of 50 different tables and thousands of fields at once (like 10,000), all joined on non-clustered indexes.  And not just one query like this, but tons coming through.\n\nStarted to look at query plans and calculate algorithmic complexity. Some of this was resulting in 100 Billion Query Steps and killing the Data Warehouse, while also locking all sorts of tables and causing resource locks of every imaginable style.  The data warehouse, until the rise of citizen developers, was so overprovisioned that it rarely exceeded 5% of its total compute capability; however, it is now spiking at 100%.\n\nThat being said, management is overjoyed to boast about how they are adding more and more 'vibe coders' (who have no background in development and can't code, i.e., they are unfamiliar with concepts such as inner joins versus outer joins or even basic SQL syntax). They know how to click, cut, paste, and run. Paste the entire schema dump and run the query.  This is the same management by the way that signed a deal with a cloud provider and agreed to pay $2million dollars for 2TB of cold log storage lol \n\nThe rise of Citizen Developers is causing issues where I am, with potentially high future costs.

        "content": "Recently I decided to start out as a Freelancer, a big part of my problem was that I need to show some projects in my portfolio and github, but most of my work was in corporates and I cant share any of the information or show code from my experience. So, I decided to make some projects for my portfolio, to show demos of what I offer as a freelancer for companies and startups.\n\nAs an experiment, I decided to try out vibe coding, setting up a fully automated daily batch etl from api requests to aws lambda functions, athena db and daily jobs with flows and crawlers.\n\nTakes from my first project:\n\n1. Vibe coding is a trap, if I didn't have 5 years of experience, I wouldv'e made the worst project I could imagine, with bad and old practices, unreadable code, no edgecase handling and just a lot of bad stuff\n2. It can help with direction, and setting up very simple tasks one by one, but you shouldn't give the AI large tasks at once.\n3. Always try to provide your prompts a taste of the data, the structure is never enough.\n4. If you spend more than 20 minutes trying to solve a problem with AI, it probably won't solve it. (at least not in a clean and logical way)\n5. The code it creates between files and tasks is very inconsistent, looks like a different developer made it everytime, make sure to provide it with older code it made so it knows to keep the consistency.\n\nExample of my worst experience:\n\nI tried creating a crawler for my partitioned data reading CSV files from S3 into an athena table. my main problem was that my dates didnt show up correctly, the problem the AI thought was very focused on trying to change data formats until it hits something that athena supports. the real problem was actually in another column that contained commas in the strings, but because I gave the AI the data and it looked at the dates as the problem, no matter what it tried, it never tried to look outside the box. I tried for around 2.5-3 hours fixing this problem, and ended up fixing it in 15 minutes by using my eyes instead of the AI.\n\n  \nLink to the final project repo: [https://github.com/roey132/aws\\_batch\\_data\\_demo](https://github.com/roey132/aws_batch_data_demo)\n\n\\*Note\\* - The project could be better, and there are many places to fix and use much better practices, i might review them in the future, but for now, im moving onto the next project (taking the data from aws to a streamlit dashboard.)\n\nHope it helps anyone! good luck with your projects and learning, and remember, AI is good, but its still not a replacement for your experience.",

When I was working as an Analyst, I mostly enjoyed preparing, transforming, managing the data rather than displaying it with graphs and all. Which is why I'm now targeting more Data Engineer positions. Thing is, when I'm reading job descriptions, I feel discouraged by what's asked as skills.\n\nWhat I know/have/done:\n\n* Certified SnowProCore\n* Certified Alteryx Advanced\n* Experienced Tableau Analyst \n* Used extensively PostgreSQL \n* I know Python, having used it back in the days (and some time to time) but I lost some of it. Mostly used pandas to prepare datasets. I'll need a refresher on this though.\n* Built a whole backend for a Flutter-based app (also the frontend) using Supabase: designed the schemas, the tables, RLS, Edge Functions, cron jobs (related to the startup I mentionned earlier)\n* Experience with Git\n* Have a really low understanding of container with Docker\n* Currently reading the holy bible that is The fundamentals of Data Engineering\n\n\nWhat I don't have:\n\n* Experience on AWS/Azure/GCP\n* Spark/Hadoop\n* Kafka\n* Airflow\n* DBT/Databricks\n* Didn't do a lot of data pipelines\n* Didn't do a lot of CI/CD\n\nand probably more I'm forgetting. I'm a quick learner and love to experiment, but as I want to make sure to be as prepared as possible for job interviews, I'd like to focus on the most important skill that I currently lack.

        "content": "Im a DE with several years of experience in analytics, but after a year into my role, I’m starting to feel like a failure. I wanted to become a DE because somewhere along the lines of me being an analyst, I decided I like SWE more than data analysis/science and felt DE was a happy medium.\n\nBut 1 year in, I’m not sure what I signed up for. I constantly feel like a failure at my job. Every single day I feel utterly confused because the business side of things is not clear to me - I’m given tasks, not sure what the big picture is, not sure what it is I’m supposed to accomplish. I just “do” without really knowing the upstream side of things. Then I’m told to go through source data and just feel expected to “know” how everything tied together without receiving guidance or training on the data. I ask questions and I’ve been more proactive after receiving some negative feedback lately about my ability to turn things around-frequently assigned tasks that are assumed to be “4 hours of effort” that realistically take at least few days. Multiply one task by 4-5 tasks and this is expected to be completed in a span of less than 2 weeks. \n\nI ask, communicate, document, etc. But at the end of it all, I still feel my questions aren’t being answered and my lack of knowledge due to lack of exposure or clear instructions makes me seem frequently dumb (ie: manager will be like “why would you not do this” when it was never previously explained to me and where there was no way I’d know without somebody telling me). I’ve made mistakes that felt sh*tty too because I’m so pressured to get something done on time that it ends up being sloppy. I am not really using my technical skills at all-at my old job, being one of the few people who wrote code relatively well, I developed interactive tools or built programs/libraries that really streamlined the work and helped scale things and I was frequently recognized for that work. When I go on the data science sub, I’m made to feel that my emphasis on technical skills is a waste of time because it’s the “business” and not “technical skills” that’s worth $$$. I don’t see how the 2 are mutually exclusive? I find my team has a technical debt problem and the deeper we get there, the more I don’t think this helps scale business. A lot of our “business solutions” can be scaled up for several clients but because we don’t write code and do processes in a way where we can re-use it for different use cases, we’re left with spending way too much time doing stuff tediously and manually that prolongs delays that usually then ends up feeling like a blame game that comes right back at me. \n\nI’ve been trying, really trying to reflect and be honest with myself. I’ve tried to communicate with my boss that I’m struggling with the workload. But I feel like there’s a feeling at the end that it’s me. \n\nI don’t feel great. I wish I was in a SWE role but I don’t even think that’s realistically possible for me given my lack of experience and the job market. Also not sure SWE is the move. My role seems to be evolving into a project management/product manager role and while I don’t mind gaining those skills, I also don’t know what I’m doing anymore. I don’t think this job seems like a good fit for me but I don’t know what other jobs I can do. I’ve thought about the AI/ML engineering team on my job but I don’t have enough experience at all for it. I feel too technically unskilled for other engineer jobs but not “business savvy” enough to do a non-technical project/product based role. If anybody has insight, I’d appreciate it. ",

Right now, I’m running a **single DAG** that performs a fairly straightforward **ETL process**, which includes some DBT transformations. The DAG is scheduled to run **once daily**.\n\nI’m currently in the **deployment phase**, planning to run everything on **AWS ECS**. But I’m starting to worry that this setup might be over-engineered for the current scope. Since there’s only one DAG and the workload is pretty light, I’m concerned this could waste resources and time on configuration that might not be necessary.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?  \nDo you think it's worth going through the full Airflow + ECS setup for such a simple pipeline? Or would it make more sense to use a lighter solution for now and scale later if needed?",

        "content": "So I am in my first DE job, been here for a year, working for a company who hasn't had someone whose title was DE before. There were lots of people doing small scale data engineering type tasks using a variety of no-code tools, but no one was writing custom pipelines or working with a data warehouse. I basically set up our snowflake database, ETL pipelines, and a few high impact dashboards. The situation was such that even as a relative beginner there was low-hanging fruit where I could make a big impact.\n\nWhen I was getting hired, it seemed like they were taking a chance on me as an individual but also 'data engineering' as a concept, they didn't really know if they 'needed it'. I think partly because of this, and partly because I was just out of school, my compensation is pretty low for a DE at 72k (living in a US city but not a major coastal city).\n\nBut, there are good benefits, I haven't needed to work more than 40 hours more than two or three times, and I feel like the work is interesting. I'm also able to learn on the job because I'm pretty much defining/inventing the tech stack as I go. There is a source of tension though where it feels like no one really understands when I do something innovative or creative to solve a problem, and because of that sometimes it feels like timelines/expectations are expressed with no knowledge of what goes into my work which can be a little frustrating. But, to be fair nothing ever really happens when a timeline is missed.\n\nMy hunch is that if I asked for a raise it would be denied since they seem to be under the impression anyone with a basic data engineering related education could take my place. IMO, if someone tried to take my place there would be a months-long learning process about the business and all the data relationships before they could support existing work let alone produce more.\n\nAnyway, just curious if this seems like I'm hoping for too much? I'm happy overall, but don't know if I am just being naive and should be getting more in terms of recognition, money, opportunities to advance. What are other people's work experiences like? I have a feeling people make more than me by a lot but I don't know if that comes with more stress too.\n\n  \nTLDR: I'm getting paid 72k with, working 40 hours a week, good benefits, not a ton of stress, 1 year of full time DE experience, should I be looking for more?",

This is quite exciting, but also I'm not so experienced to be confident about my choices here, so would really use your advice :).\n\nI need to build a system that will run multiple pipelines that will be ingesting data from various sources (MS SQL databases, API, Splunk etc.) to one MS SQL database. I'm thinking about going with the setup suggested in the title - using DLTHub for ingestion pipelines, DBT or SQLMesh for transforming data in the database and Airflow to schedule this. Is this generally speaking a good direction?\n\nFor some more context:  \n\\- for now the volume of the data is quite low and the frequency of the ingestion is daily at most;  \n\\- I need a strong focus on security and privacy due to the nature of the data;  \n\\- I'm sitting on Azure.\n\nAnd lastly a specific technical question, as I started to implement this solution locally - does anyone have experience with running dlt on Airflow? What's the optimal way to structure the credentials for connections there? For now I specified them in Airflow connections, but then in each Airflow task I need to pull the credentials from the connections and pass them to dlt source and destination, which doesn't make much sense. What's the better option?\n\nThanks!",

        "author": "sanjayio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello Data Engineers 👋\n\nI've been scouting on the internet for the best and easiest way to setup **dbt Core 1.9.0 with Airflow 3.0** orchestration. I've followed through many tutorials, and most of them don't work out of the box, require fixes or version downgrades, and are broken with recent updates to Airflow and dbt.\n\nI'm here on a mission to find and document the best and easiest way for Data Engineers to run their dbt Core jobs using Airflow, that will simply **work out of the box**. \n\n**Disclaimer**: This tutorial is designed with a Postgres backend to work out of the box. But you can change the backend to any supported backend of your choice with little effort.\n\nSo let's get started. \n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Docker desktop (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)\n- Python 3.12 or higher (https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n- Code repo (https://dbtengineer.com/airflow-with-dbt-core-tutorial/#code-repo-video-tutorial)\n\n## Video Tutorial\n\n{% embed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUfYuMjHQCc&ab_channel=DbtEngineer %}\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Clone the repo in prerequisites. \n2. Create a data folder in the root folder on your local.\n3. Rename `.env-example` to `.env` and create new values for all missing values. Instructions to create the fernet key at the end of this Readme.\n4. Rename `airflow_settings-example.yaml` to `airflow_settings.yaml` and use the values you created in `.env` to fill missing values in `airflow_settings.yaml`.\n5. Rename `servers-example.json` to `servers.json` and update the host and username values to the values you set above.\n\n## Running Airflow Locally\n\n1. Run `docker compose up` and wait for containers to spin up. This could take a while.\n2. Access pgAdmin web interface at [localhost:16543](http://localhost:16543). Create a public database under the postgres server.\n3. Access Airflow web interface at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Trigger the dag.\n\n## Running dbt Core Locally\n\nCreate a virtual env for installing dbt core\n\n```sh\npython3 -m venv dbt_venv\nsource dbt_venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nOptional, to create an alias\n\n```sh\nalias env_dbt='source dbt_venv/bin/activate'\n```\n\nInstall dbt Core\n\n```sh\npython -m pip install dbt-core dbt-postgres\n```\n\nVerify Installation\n\n```sh\ndbt --version\n```\n\nCreate a `profile.yml` file in your `/Users/<yourusernamehere>/.dbt` directory and add the following content. \n\n```yaml\ndefault:\n  target: dev\n  outputs:\n    dev:\n      type: postgres\n      host: localhost\n      port: 5432\n      user: your-postgres-username-here\n      password: your-postgres-password-here\n      dbname: public\n      schema: public\n```\n\nYou can now run dbt commands from the dbt directory inside the repo.\n\n```sh\ncd dbt/hello_world\ndbt compile\n```\n\n## Cleanup\n\nRun `Ctrl + C` or `Cmd + C` to stop containers, and then `docker compose down`.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Generating fernet key\n\n```sh\npython3 -c \"from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())\"\n```\n\nI hope this tutorial was useful. Let me know your thoughts and questions in the comments section. \n\nHappy Coding!",

        "content": "Hi there,\n\nmy company recently decided to use Apache Kafka to share data among feature \nteams and analytics. Most of the topics are in Avro format. The Kafka cluster\nis provided by an external company, which also has a UI to see some data and\nsome metrics.\n\nNow, the more topics we have, the more our devs want to debug certain things and analytics people want to explore data. \nSo the ui technically allows that, but search for a specific message is not \npossible. We have now explored other methods to do \"data exploration\":\n\n\n* Flink -> too complicated and too much overhead\n* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Json) fails to properly deserialize logicalType \"decimal\" (wtf?)\n* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Parquet) can handle decimals, but ignores tombstones (wtf?)\n* besides: Kafka Connect means, having an immutable copy of the topic - probably not a good idea anyways\n* we are using AWS, so Athena provides a Kafka Connector. Implementation and \nconfiguration is so hacky. It cannot even connect to our Schema registry and \nrequires to have a copy of the schema in Glue (wtf?)\n* Trino's Kafka Connector works surprisingly good, but has the same issue with decimals.\n\nFor you Kafka users out there, do you have the same issues? I was a bit \nsurprised having these kinds of issues with a technology that is that mature \nand widely adopted. \nAny tool suggestions? Is everyone using Json as a topic \nformat? Is it the same with ProtoBuf?\n\nA little side rant: I was writing a consumer in python, which should write the \ndata as parquet files. Getting data from Avro+AvroSchema into a Arrow table, \nwhile using the provided schema is also rather complicated. Both Avro and Arrow \nare big Apache projects. I was expecting some interoperability. I know that the \nArrow Java Implementation, can , supposedly,  deserialize Avro directly into \nArrow. But not the C/Python Implementation.\n\n",

I don't know if I am doing things the right way. But my use case is to generate vector embeddings for one of the `string` columns (say `a`) in my DataFrame. I also have another vector embedding for a `blacklist`.\n\nNow, I when I am generating vector embeddings for `a` I first filter out nulls and certain useless records and generate the embeddings for the remaining of them (say `b`).  Then I do a cosine similarity between the embeddings in `b` and `blacklist`. Then I only keep the records with the max similarity.

While using Spark for EDA isn’t a big issue, it becomes more complex when training models with PyTorch, since combining Spark, Iceberg, and PyTorch introduces additional complexity due to the JVM and Python interoperability.\n\nIn general, when ML/DS teams want to train models (mostly written in Python) using data stored in Iceberg tables, what are the common ways to load that data from Iceberg into their Python(Pytorch, ML) workflows?",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently joined a new company and started this week. My first assigned task is optimizing an existing pipeline that the team has been using. However, the pipeline requires significant work.\n\nThis team hasn’t had a dedicated data professional before, so they outsourced pipeline development to an offshore team. Upon reviewing the pipeline, I was shocked. There’s zero documentation, no helpful comments or method signatures, and even variable declarations are riddled with errors (e.g., indexes spelled as indekes). The function and class naming conventions are also poor. While I haven’t done extensive data engineering work before, I’m certain these are subpar coding practices. It seems the offshore team got away with this because no one technical was overseeing the work. The pipeline has broken frequently in the past, and instead of proper fixes, it’s been patched with band-aid solutions when what it really needs is a complete overhaul.\n\n# The Core Problem:\n\nThe team wants a unified database where each customer has a unique primary key. However:\n\n* Data comes from 5-6 sources, none of which have primary keys for joining.\n* PII (and other details) for the same customer can differ across sources.\n* The goal is to deduplicate and unify all customer records under a single ID.\n\nI’m considering fuzzy matching, but with \\~1M rows, pairwise comparisons are computationally expensive. The offshore team attempted a workaround:\n\n1. **Blocking:** Grouping potentially similar records (name variants, emails and phone numbers) to reduce comparison scope.\n2. **Similarity Scoring:** Running comparisons only within these blocks.\n\nI had some questions\n\n1. Is there a better approach? Have you worked on similar problems? Any recommended tools/strategies?\n2. Learning resources? I’m relatively new to data engineering and want to do this right. Any books, papers, or guides on large-scale deduplication?\n\nThis is a critical project, and I’d appreciate any advice whether technical, procedural, or even just moral support! Thanks in advance, and feel free to ask follow-up questions.",

From my understanding, parquets are formatted in a way to not load excess data when querying items inside nested structs as of 2.4sh.\n\nOtherwise, the alternative is splitting apart the data into 30-60 tables for each data type we have in our Iceberg tables to flatten out repeated fields. Without testing yet, I would presume queries are faster with nested structs than doing several one-many joins for usable data.\n\nThanks!",

I feel like a glorified babysitter. I want to start relearning Data Engineering, bridge my gaps, and learn how to DE at an advanced level, i.e. proper data modeling design and technique, advanced SQL, etc.\n\nAny courses or resources you would recommend?",

We use airflow version 2.10.2.\n\nI tried to do my research both in web and with the AI support, and the suggestion was to go with \"Custom Email Backend in Airflow\", meaning to replace the`airflow.utils.email.send_email_smtp`with  my own  function that handles OAuth2.\n\nI have created this post because I am looking for advice and some sort of validation whether it is really the best approach, considering the scenario that we would need to still use the Microsoft Office account (and not e.g. gmail). I would really like to make sure that the transition/changes we will be implementing are not in fact introducing some anti-patterns...   \nIs there any better/more clean way of tackling it?  \n  \nThanks!

So this won't work.\n* Row filtering is a feature in Fivetran, but only for database sources, not for Qualtrics.\n\nI'm thinking we'd need to dump all of the data into our own destination first and then sync across the filtered data to their lake...I suppose this will work, but I'm just looking for ideas in case I can avoid the multi step process.",

        "content": "Hi. This is purely a pedantic question, with no practical impact on what is being developed. But still curiosity may lead to some fruitful discussion.\n\nWe have a typical data pipeline, where some data are going to go daily through a series of transformations, and finally written into a unified database schema. \n\nNow, for most cases, the source and destination/sink of that data is on the same database instance. Therefore, what we can do, is to just run everything a sequence of SQL statements (`INSERT INTO T(n+1).... SELECT ... FROM Tn` etc), without actually \"loading\" any data into our server. So all data stays in teh database server and transformed there. It has the huge benefit that we don't have to deal with partitioning, distribution etc. \n\nSo, it's quite clear to me that it's not ETL since we don't extract data into our data processing server and then transform it (or not?). But is it ELT indeed, given that we do not leave the transformation for after loading the data, and we do not store raw data (well we do, but only as T0 to feed our pipeline). Is it neither of them, or some other Jargon I don't know about? ",

Stretching on the is good?\n\nHi everyone,\n\nMy wife and I live in the SF Bay Area. She grew up in Middle East and moved here after our marriage. Back there, she worked for one of the top employers, but here she’s struggling to get calls from tier 1 (FAANG) or tier 2 (just below FAANG) companies — or sometimes even tier 3.\n\nShe has a BS in Computer Science and currently  a senior data analyst. She’s genuinely smart and extremely good at what she does — honestly, she’s smarter than me in most ways!\n\nShe wants to move from data analytics into data engineering, but as you all know, the required skill sets are different — pipelines, cloud, distributed systems, ETL frameworks, etc.\n\nHere’s where we differ: I came to the US for my master’s and I’m more of a hustler. I stretch my skills a lot to match the job description — for example, I highlight skills I may not be an expert in but know enough to talk about, just to get calls and clear interviews. Then I prep like crazy to bridge any gaps. She, on the other hand, doesn’t want to do that — she feels it’s dishonest and wants to break in purely on what she’s actually done.\n\nSo my question is: what’s the best honest path for her to break into a tier 1 or tier 2 company as a data engineer? Can anyone tell her it’s good to stretch the skill sets\n\nIf anyone here has made this switch (without a US degree), we’d love to hear how you did it. Any advice, resources, or realistic tips to help her get her foot in the door in tier1 or tier2 companies with or without lying on her would mean a lot.\n\nThanks so much in advance!",

        "author": "Away-Violinist3104",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks – my friend and I have been thinking a lot about the communication overhead between business stakeholders and data engineers when it comes to building data pipelines. From what we observe at our job and further validated by chatting with a couple friends in data engineering space, a lot of time is spent just getting alignment – business users describing what they want, engineers trying to translate that into something technically feasible, and a lot of back-and-forth when things aren’t clear.\n\nWe’re exploring whether it’s possible to reduce this overhead with a self-service tool powered by an “AI data engineer” agent. The idea is:\n\n* Business users specify what they want (e.g., “I need a dashboard showing X broken down by Y every week”).\n* The AI agent builds the pipeline using the existing data stack.\n* If there's any ambiguity or missing context, it prompts the user for feedback. If they don’t know the answer, they can loop in a technical person, all in the same tool. Technical/data team can provide necessary context so the agent can carry forward.\n* After getting clarification, the agent continues building the pipeline.\n* Once the pipeline is built, technical/data team verify, review, edit or approve \n\nThis way, non-technical users could handle more of the work themselves, and engineers can focus on higher-leverage tasks instead of ad-hoc asks.\n\nWe’re super early ideation and trying to understand if this is actually a real pain point for others – or if it’s already solved well enough with existing tools, or is it just another \"imagined problem\".\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts:\n\n* Do you run into this communication gap in your org?\n* Would something like this be useful, or would it just add noise?\n* Are there any tools out there that already handle this well?\n\nAny perspectives would be appreciated!",

I have seen stuff from Azure Functions and Batch Processing (which I have little experience configuring and setting up). Another solution would be to just migrate to a full python approach with Apache Airflow but that would be another system to configure... \n\nI would love assistance on how people use ADF and Python or if I should be thinking in a different way for these pipelines.

        "content": "I am considering database CI/CD frameworks for a long term project to handle database evolution eloquently. At my place of work, it's pretty common to just spin up at a database and have an admin make ad-hoc changes to create/modify users, permissions, schemas, tables, etc. (if you're lucky, they commit those changes to a repo). This generally doesn't pose any issues when we expect the life-cycle of the project to be a matter of months-- and it helps us move quick when we have a crunched deadline and a smallish team, reduces overhead/red tape, but scrappy. For reference, these are generally analytic databases, not hooked up to any downstream application, save for a dashboard here or there. Our products are generally processed data itself or research derived from that data. \n\nThe downsides to this scrappy database approach is the one prod environment can become messy, the admin might not always remember to commit ddl changes to version control, and if a dev is creating stored procs or something, that is likely going to fly under the radar of source/version control. Ultimately it can become hard to maintain and hard to appropriately gatekeep and record what changes are made when. \n\nSo I come with a question for those of you that use flyway, liquibase, atlas, dbmate or any similar tools: How has it made your life easier/harder? How do you get buy-in from your teams? Feel free to note anything else about using these tools that feels relevant. ",

        "author": "cheyyne",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "If you haven't heard of it, Bitburner is a free coding game in which you take on the role of a hacker writing Javascript to hack computers in a cyberpunk world, earn money, and eventually do lots of things that I can't go into here.\n\nThe actual 'hacking' is very simplified, the game doesn't teach you cyber security - it's more about writing code that gets things done. In the beginning of the game, you are shown examples for how to write basic things, which you can then learn to improve upon.\n\nThe game naturally evolves to become a bit more complex as you play, and you are rewarded for thinking about how to make things happen more efficiently, which results in a rewarding gameplay loop that fosters learning without holding your hand, so you have creative freedom.\n\nAnd that's sort of the thing of it; you can muddle through using code that's 'good enough' *if you want to.* But you will more likely be inspired to find that next way to level up your code, to make it more effective, to find the inefficiency and ruthlessly eliminate it.\n\nA large part of what makes the game useful is that you are writing real code in a real language using real javascript syntax, with scripts that are really running on your computer; there is very good documentation that you can read to figure out how to improve your code yourself, and how to understand the in-game systems; and the in-game help for how you might approach newly unlocked mechanics is quite good, though not universally so (looking at you, corporate \"Smart Supply\" script example!). And if you get stuck, there is a Discord full of very helpful people who can assist you with whatever you don't understand.\n\nAnyhow, though I've done a lot in other languages, before last year I hadn't learned almost any Javascript. Now I've got almost a thousand hours in Bitburner, I've learned how to think about a lot of elementary coding problems in new ways, I've learned a lot of Javascript, and I've even come face to face with a number of Javascript's hated quirks - all from just trying to *make more damn money than I did on my last run, given my current system's limitations.*\n\nSo I heartily recommend giving it a shot. You can find Bitburner on Steam, or at [https://bitburner-official.github.io/](https://bitburner-official.github.io/). You can find the documentation for all the game's commands [here, at https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/stable/markdown/bitburner.ns.md). (It says NS, which just means the object which, for all intents and purposes, contains the commands and functions that you can do in the game that aren't straight javascript declarations). Expect a certain amount of exploration - once you're knee deep, you'll be checking through documentation for a given mechanic and get valuable 'Aha!' moments.\n\n**NOTE: If you are playing to learn coding, I strongly recommend -avoiding- looking up other player's solutions.** It's okay to start off with an example, but you'll only grow as a programmer by figuring out novel ways to overcome the challenges you'll face. The solution you find for yourself, even if it's less efficient, is infinitely more valuable - and you will find more and more solutions as you get better at thinking like a coder. If you really do hit a hard wall, you might ask AI how a problem could be approached - you'll find GPT has a good corpus of Bitburner dialect in its training data - but do your best to solve your problems with whatever you find in the help files and in the game's documentation. And if you do give in, you could ask on the Bitburner discord, where players will be happy to hint at the right approach without out and out solving the puzzle for you.\n\nAnyway, I hope some novice coders find this valuable and discover how fun coding can be through this game. (I have no affiliation with the game or its devs. Just a big fan.) Have fun! Happy coding!",

I personally love it and have legitimately found that it has changed my career trajectory for the better. So many advanced concepts felt clear only when I learned Haskell. Most notably concurrent programming. \n\nI also see so many posts by users in this community that they are struggling to grasp concepts or move past beginner. Not saying it will for sure work for everyone but like it definitely worked for me? \n\nYet if I was to speak on that experience Id be called culty and just experience pure hate for FP with no explanation. I really have never experienced this cultiness people talk about. Wouldn't this hate signal that OOP is kinda culty? Like to me a cult is like a religion in that you're not supposed to question it but I've never met a Haskell dev like that, in fact they will probably happily and curiously chat about my question with me for hours. On the OOP side I've never really heard any convincing explanation as to why we do things a certain way, there's just the \"pythonic\" way to do stuff for example. But then if I point out an issue with their logic it always becomes \"how come you dont know OOP\" or some crazy question which is weird because OOP is quite simple and it often times has nothing to do with OOP theory. Before I get attacked inevitably with questions of the same category as that, I do have experience with OOP and my past project was acquired by Xerox to help plan their sales efforts. \n\nIve also never heard any reason why Haskell is a bad choice besides it can be hard to learn, which I do agree with to an extent, but that's a very fixable problem as its often taught by researchers who are obsessed with the most advanced aspects of the language, and there are many great resources like learn you a Haskell that make it easy as all heck to learn.

Some dummies need to study English rather than digital electronics.\n\n\nI just want to share my humble opinion from what I saw and experienced. This post may not be suitable for complete beginners. I assume that you already know DS&A and can build something at least in two different languages.\n\nI see so many questions, not only in this subreddit but generally on the web, like \"which language should I choose/is good to start/should I learn,\" etc. I think this is kind of missing the idea of \"software engineering\" or development.\n\nI bet most of us were stuck in \"language hell\" before. What should I learn? C? C++? Java? Fortran? Cobol? PL/I? Python? Rust? You can extend this list.\n\nLanguage is usually the easiest part of programming. Because in 2025, you can just open Google and type \"xyz language syntax/libraries,\" and then you get a kabillion resources about it.\n\nIf language were that important, I bet most of the computer science classes would focus on low or mid-level languages like Assembly or C and similar languages.\n\nSo you (we) should focus on technology rather than the syntax. You should focus on \"how can I store/manipulate/transmit this digital data more efficiently?\"\n\nWhen you list your languages in your CV like this:\n\n* C & C++\n* Java\n* Python\n* Haskell\n* Verilog\n* so on\n\nyes, it shows something but not everything or big picture. It is still too abstract and does not answer \"Are you capable of using the [ARINC 429](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_429) standard to transfer encrypted data?\" or \"Which boards did you work on?\" or \"Have you deployed a containerized microservice on Kubernetes with Helm charts?\" or \"Can you deploy a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins?\"\n\nThe other issue that occurs due to focusing on languages too much is that you do not know how you should create your portfolio. Since you focused on the language, you are hanging around basic implementations like a calculator, simple USB driver, or an asynchronous web page, etc.\n\nThe more experienced programmers would notice that I am pointing out the \"specialization.\"  \nLet's be honest, in 2025, industries do not need too many juniors.\n\nSo rather than obsessing about languages, explore the telecommunication standards, protocols, and preferred [software architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_architecture_styles_and_patterns) and technologies you’ll actually use in your target industry, then build projects around those. This approach will teach you the necessary language and engineering skills at the same time.",

Like, what made the switch from “I’m just reading stuff” to “I actually understand what I’m doing”?\n\nMost advice out there is the same laundry list: spaced repetition, Pomodoro, flashcards, blah blah. But I’m way more curious about how people landed on what works for them. Did you start by failing a lot and then tweaking your method? Copy a YouTuber’s setup and slowly ditch most of it? Realize that everything falls apart after 3 p.m. so you built your schedule around that?\n\nI think a lot of us, especially in programming, go through that phase where we’re doing tutorials on autopilot, feeling like we’re learning, but nothing sticks. Then something clicks. Maybe it's building your own project, maybe it's just doing spaced recall the right way, or realizing that you need to write code, not just watch it being written.\n\nPersonally, I used to grind tutorial after tutorial thinking I was improving, but I couldn’t build anything from scratch. Only after I started using flashcards and forcing myself to explain stuff in my own words did things actually start sticking.\n\nAnyway, I’d love to hear what your turning point was. Like, when did learning stop being random chaos and start becoming a process you understood?\n",

Though I'd say it only 'clicked' 7-8 years ago when I got into automation and scraping for some hobby projects (mostly in Python, but dabbled with a few other languages and Android apps too).\n\nNever got any formal training, not even classes at school (I was homeschooled throughout). Honestly looking back, my stuff was pretty much cobbled together from Stack Overflow - but they worked at the time, and I genuinely enjoyed making them.\n\nWell, that lasted until a couple years ago when some shit hit the fan around high school grad age. Convinced myself I'm burnt out, and barely learned anything during that period, except finishing CS50X and CS50P.\n\nAnyway, figured it's time to cut the cycle. I'm still unsure which subfield or job I want, but I know I should work on my understanding of CS theory - and that would mean basically everything beyond basic scripting.\n\nAn IRL formal CS uni degree is currently not an option for that, so I'm looking for a structured, self-taught online alternative. Looking over the resources list, OSSU and TeachYourselfCS caught my eye, so now I'm trying to decide between those two before I commit.\n\nFrom what I understand, OSSU starts from zero and is a 1-2 years long commitment but has a more active community, while TeachYourselfCS assumes some prior knowledge but claims to have a more targeted scope. Given my background, which would you recommend and why? Or would you suggest something else entirely?",

I've learnt a lot mostly on random topics etc. At first i was just doing it as a side-thing in case i *enjoyed it*. \n\nAnd i quickly found i did, i loved to create and solve problems, research, debug and refactor, the whole lot. \n\nThe issue was, i never planned to go to University/College. I didn't think the career path would be for me. \n\nUntil recently (earlier this year) when i began to actively try and get a job (which is almost impossible for me). \n\nSo i decided while i wait, i study core compsci topics that i missed out.\n\nI did a bit of random study all over the place (like with roadmap.sh and random lectures/tutorials). \n\nUntil i heard of OSSU. \n\nIt's great... but at the same time, my attention is just so lacking at my age, i feel like 10+ years ago i would have loved studying like this, but now? It feels so tiresome and tiring. \n\nIt probably doesn't help that\n\n 1. I'm cramming as much as i can\n2. The topics so far are all things I've already learnt. \n\nBut i just really want to be able to say \"Hey, i know i dont have a degree, but i did this online pathway!\"\n\nThere are many reasons i initially didn't go for a degree (health and finances being the main two). But now I'm kinda glad i didnt? I don't know if i could have dredged on for 4 years like this, i very much just want the next 6-12months to fly by (my estimated finish time for OSSU). So that i can just focus on increasing my portfolio.\n\nBut yeah, wondering if anyone has been in the same boat? Studying later in life.",

I’m really interested in building a solid career in the IT field, but with so many programming languages out there, I’m a bit confused about where to start and which one to focus on.\n\nSo far, I’ve been exploring a few basics, but I want to know:\n\n* **Which programming language should I prioritize** for a good future in the IT industry?\n* Should I focus more on **web development, app development, data science, or something else**?\n* Is it better to master one language or learn a bit of multiple ones in the beginning?\n\nI would really appreciate suggestions or guidance from those who’ve been through this journey or are currently working in the field. Any roadmap or personal advice would help a lot!\n\nThanks in advance!",

My issue is that I can’t seem to decide on one. I enjoy working with all of them, and whenever I spend a few hours coding in one language, I get the urge to switch to another cool language. Right now, I’ve got my eye on C++.\n\nI’m not sure where I want to go professionally, which makes it hard for me to choose a language, since I can’t even decide on a specific field.\n\nI find embedded systems and backend/cloud very exciting. ML also seems interesting, but probably involves too much math (I do like math, but I probably do not like it enough for that).\n\nIs there anyone here who has been in a similar situation?  \nI’m not switching languages because I find them hard or don’t enjoy them. I love them all — and hate myself for it :(\n\nEvery field and language I’ve explored is exciting to me. But now that I’m close to finishing my bachelor’s degree, I feel like I’m wasting time by constantly switching between them.\n\nI jump from one thing to another so often that I end up feeling paralyzed when it comes to making a decision — and in the end, I barely get around to actually coding anymore.",

        "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI've been on reddit for a while, mostly just reading and learning from other people's stories. But now, I finally decided to write my own post to share my journey and ask for some honest advice about my career path. **If you've been through something similar or just want to share your stories, I'd really appreciate it.**\n\n**Warning: wall of text.**\n\nI graduated in 2018 with a degree in Software Engineering from a university (not top tier). The program was mostly practical, not too much theory. At that time, the job market in tech was really good.\n\nI started working at a few software outsourcing companies, focused on web dev. Because of the nature of the projects, I had to work with many different technologies. I think this is one of the biggest differences between outsourcing companies and product companies. I didn't get a chance to go deep into any technology, as soon as I started to get familiar with something, I had to switch to something else.\n\nAlso, many of my friends were working at big companies and making a lot of money. That made me feel peer-pressured and pushed me to switch jobs often, chasing better pay, even though my skills weren't really strong enough to match those expectations.\n\nOver time, I started feeling lost and didn't know what I was working toward anymore. I also started to lose motivation, so I made a big decision to go study abroad for 2 years, hoping to find a new direction and more opportunities. I guess this is another big mistake that I made.\n\nWith how tough the job market is right now, I've spent long time doing self-reflection. I realized that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Sometimes we don't appreciate what we already have until it's gone. And I've learned that success takes real effort and time, there are no shortcuts. If I had worked continuously since graduation, I would have over 7 YOE by now, but because of many breaks and job changes, I still feel like I'm only at a mid-level, not senior yet. I'm still afraid to apply for senior roles.",

        "author": "franzz4",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So, I started learning programming last December with Python. Since then, I’ve studied several programming languages like C, Rust, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Flutter (Dart). I tried out different languages used in different areas, such as back-end (C, Rust, Python, and JavaScript), front-end (HTML/CSS and JavaScript), and mobile (Kotlin and Flutter). After testing several different areas, here’s the conclusion I came to:\n\n**Front-end and Mobile:** It’s fun and interesting, but I don’t really see myself working professionally with UI — only in personal projects. The languages are manageable, but the problem is that there are thousands of frameworks that do the same thing, and the job market expects you to know several (especially in Web). In the end, it’s hard to pick one to focus on and really master.\n\n**Back-end:** I found it really fun to work with connections, APIs, databases, JSON, and making the project work behind the scenes. The languages are good (some are hard), and there are several options as well. However, it’s easier to pick one or two languages to specialize in back-end than it is in front-end. That’s why I decided to focus on back-end.\n\nAfter learning the basics of programming, like: programming logic, algorithms, data structures, and Git/GitHub, I’d like to ask for your opinion — **which language do you recommend I focus on right now?**  \nFrom what I’ve seen, the most recommended ones are:\n\n* Python\n* Java\n* C#\n* Go\n* Rust\n\nI was thinking about going back to Python and Rust since I already have some background with them, but I’d love to hear your opinions.",

        "title": "Imposter syndrome after 5 years of C++",
        "author": "C_Sorcerer",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "As the title states, I would call myself a C++ programmer because it’s the main language I use.  Of course, there are others I use, like C, Java, TS, python, etc.  but I have stuck to C++ for so long because after graduating (I’m in my final year of CS bachelors), I want to work in systems programming/high performance systems programming (particularly computer graphics).  As such, I’ve spent the most time with C++, especially with graphics because that is so far my favorite area of CS and C++ is built for such high performance yet complex applications like game engines and has very good support for OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, GLFW, GLM, etc.  \n\nBut, even after 5 years of time spent, every time I start up a big project I get super bummed out because my code looks nothing like other folks code bases.  Or I’ll end up watching some CPP con talk where the speaker essentially says everything I’m doing is wrong.  Even going through the r/CPP subreddit (a great subreddit, no hate), it just seems like my code is way too archaic and I just don’t get it.  No matter how much I try to modularize and use professional OOP principles in my programs, it just doesn’t ever look right and leads to essentially a more procedural approach which seems to be looked down upon by most C++ programmers.\n\nOf course, this imposter syndrome leads me to quit projects and rage delete everything that I’m working on.  My GitHub went from 20 projects to about 2 because of how much I hated all my stuff.  I just don’t have this issue with other languages either; for the most part with C, Java, Rust, etc. there is an intuitive way of doing things but with C++ it drives me insane because I have no idea the right way to do things when there’s so much stuff.  But there’s not much other choice when it comes to computer graphics because it seems that C++ is the primary language for that kind of stuff so I just have to deal with it\n\nSo is this a normal feeling? Should I continue with C++ or should I maybe get better at using another language and then applying what i learn from other languages to C++? Or is there a good alternative to C++?",

And from that backend (let's say it's hosted for free on Vercel), I should be able to make automatic daily API calls with a cron job and store that data on a database that can be used whenever I make a request from my frontend? \n\nSo in short, I'm just trying to wrap my head around the front end back end interaction. From my understanding, it's basically: Github Front End HTTP request to Back End hosted not on github, then the backend sends back some queried data from the database that is automatically updating every day?\n\n",

I can make APIs and I understand HTTP to a good extent and all that stuff, I can make CRUD APIs if I wanted. But I also have this itch to make more complex projects, things that will teach me more than just language or library features. For example, I want to try to make a mini Express.js with the Node HTTP module, but when I try to think of how I would even start this project my mind just goes blank. I feel like I should know this, but I don't.\n\nI've been building APIs in raw Node.js, so I think I should at least be able to come up with some sort of abstraction around the HTTP module, kind of like what express does with app.get() and more. But for some reason, I can't. It's like I can understand HTTP, custom middleware, routing, and serving static files, but when I want to make something a step-up from basic CRUD APIs, I feel like I'm back to square one and I actually haven't learned anything. And it isn't just about this project, it's in general. For example, if I go to the \"Project based learning\" github repo and check out the Node section, it says things like \"Build a real-time Markdown editor in Node.js\", \"build a web framework\", \"build a real-time serverless GraphQL API with WebSockets on AWS\". I feel like I should maybe have SOME idea as to what things I would need to do, but I can't even think of one and if I do then I'll realize it's not a perfect solution and then I have to go back and think about it. It's very discouraging because I thought I was doing well...",

Due to the unreliability of our network, we sometime can drop for a few seconds before connection is reestablished.\n\nRight now we are using TCP sockets to establish communications and communicate, sending the data as a single Json object (made before I got there).\n\nWe have a second remote facility being built right now, so we want to improve these performances and fine tune our software before it is completed and in operation.\n\n## Questions\n\nOur main goal right now is to improve the reliability of our data.\nSince we cannot do much in terms of the actual communications, we were thinking about using a more reliable/resilient protocol like MQTT, or maybe NATS, but we don't have any experience with them.

        "content": "After 13 years in software development, I was laid off this past April. And while it hurt, it also felt like a strange kind of relief.\n\nThe last few years were brutal with constant pressure, toxic teams, and impossible deadlines. I kept telling myself I still loved coding, but the truth is, the spark has been gone for a while. I’m burned out, drained, and the thought of jumping into another dev job just fills me with dread.\n\nI want out, not out of tech necessarily, but out of pure software development. I’m tired of the grind, the endless new frameworks, the feeling that my work is just disappearing into the void.\n\nBut I feel stuck. My whole identity has been “software developer” for so long. I don’t know how to reframe my skills, or even what I’m qualified for outside of coding all day. Starting over is scary, and I don’t know where to begin.\n\nHave any of you made a big pivot after burnout or layoffs? What roles still leverage your technical background, but offer something more sustainable, more human? I’m looking at things like solutions architecture or tech-focused product roles, but I’m open to anything that doesn’t suck the life out of me again.",

I wasn’t trying to sell myself or anything, just being myself. It kind of made me realise that whole saying about \"it's who you know\" might actually be true.\n\nCurious what others think about that.

        "content": "Basically, I have been in this field for 6-7 years now. Mostly as a full stack developer. I am not new to this field and even with that I am just tired of this field.\n\nI felt it might get better, but I feel it has only gotten worse. Started in this field a little before COVID hit and heard that is when things started going downhill in this field (outside that window of massive hiring for 1.5 year) around then. My experience backs this.\n\nThe expectations in this field are insane and none of my friends in other fields come close to putting up with this. The interview process is out of control and much of it has nothing to do with on the job stuff. So you have to learn on your own these things to do the interviews. The expectations while you have a job are insane. You are mostly led by non-technical people who fail to grasp how complex what they are asking you to do is and unrealistic deadlines because they are too scared to tell their managers no.\n\nAlso, endless learning new stupid languages and stacks because someone in the world just has to create \"another language\" for their own ego, that ultimately does not make anything easier. Just makes it a new thing you have to learn.\n\nNevermind the horrible job market in tech specifically. Endless layoffs, one of the highest unemployment rates of any white collar job field (we are higher than the average now), and clear attempts to send any new jobs overseas. So you can't even get a chance to compete for those jobs that go abroad.\n\nUltimately I'm just over it. I'm done. I want out. I just don't see a future in this field anymore.\n\nWhat are some realistic paths I can take to get out of this field given my CS degree and experience? I'm ok with going back to school or pay for some training if it means there is a realistic path to getting employment. As long as it won't take more than 2 years. Ideally 1 year. Open to any idea though. I'm ok taking a paycut too, anything in 80k-100k pay range is ok with me.\n\nI'm just over it. What are my options? Does anyone have any suggestions?",

After taking a few months off to work on a passion project, I'm realizing it's likely not going to produce income soon enough for my family, so I'm reentering the salaried job market.\n\nPrior to this I was staff engineer at a public tech company, and prior to that I was CTO of a startup which was acquired by that tech company, so I haven't done any interviewing myself for over 10 years. During that time I would say about half was hands on engineering (coding, submitting or reviewing PRs) and half on architecture/leadership.\n\nIn conversations with recruiters, I have been forthright in my inexperience interviewing, saying things like I don't expect to do well on things like LeetCode interviews. Most of the recruiters I've spoken to say \"oh, we don't do LeetCode interviews here.\" You know, they want to sound _different than the other companies_. However, the very next call I have with the company will be a tech screen where I am asked to do a LeetCode style puzzle, and inevitably I bomb. \n\nThere are many factors here--I am self taught--and I discovered have more test anxiety than I realized. Also, these \"problems\" are often just little puzzles that I've rarely if ever seen in my 25 years of software engineering, so I am simply rusty at solving them in the allotted time. My problem solving may also follow a non-traditional sequence that the interviewer is simply not used to seeing (like, incorrect \"order of operations\" even though I solve the problem).\n\nRegardless of whether the companies are saying they do LeetCode style questions or not, it seems like I have no choice but to grind it out until I can pass these silly interviews. I'm curious if that is what other people are experiencing? Like, there are obviously ways to get much better signal from candidates--and as a hiring manager for many many years I've developed my own preferences--but as a candidate it seems I can't influence the process at all. \n\nI'm curious what the fine folks here would say. Do I just suck it up and grind LC? Have people found success asking for alternative interviews like take-homes, PR reviews, peer coding, etc? Are there companies that I should be looking at? \n\nAnyway, thanks for listening and for any feedback or advice you can offer. Best of luck out there on your interview loops!",

Based on convos with the teams, WLB at Google should be solid for the foreseeable future. WLB @ Meta should be comparable for the first year or so, but it sounds like on-call could get rough after that (specifically the on-call severity may worsen next year).\n\nComplicating things, I’ve already signed with Meta.

WLB is good but time is tracked so it’s not the kind of place where I can leave early if I’m done. The office is a bland cube farm and much more depressing than the office I saw in my interview. Should I try to get out ASAP or am I just being dramatic?",

I can't understand how I can have a work life balance when during free time I'm expected to keep up with new tech and do personal projects.

After one year they allow remote work + give a significant raise in salary.\n\nThe key issue here is that the first role is almost exclusively focused on debugging driver/GPU issues and there is little to no implementation to be done. I imagine that I would become something of a linux kernel / GPU driver guru after some time of doing this kind of work.\n\nThe other role pays better (especially after the one year re-negotiation) and allows for remote work but it's more of a regular C++ SWE engineering implementation job, after a year this would be \\~45k euro at google (net of tax) vs \\~75k euro (net of tax) at the other company.\n\nMy two questions to people who have experience in the industry are:\n\n1. Would having google in my CV have a significant impact on my career compared to experience at some other company?\n2. Could doing no implementation and essentially only debugging be dertimental to my engineering skills or actually help me grow?

Also, it is not a tech company. A lot of the work I've done both in this job and in my internships is not impressive or exciting. In reality, most of it has been work done on internal tooling or your everyday basic crud app. I haven't worked on complex problems, I haven't ever come across a project that I felt would take a stroke of genius to solve. I'm stagnating, and have been for a while.\n\nThe problem is that I need to make more money. And I don't know where to start. I'm looking for other roles but I'm getting no bites. I'm working on side projects but the things I'm passionate about wouldn't get me hired or paid well. I've done so much Leetcode but I still flop interviews. Hell, I don't even get interviews. But I did flop the ones I got, other than my current job, of course. \n\nNow, the question is this: if I want FAANG to look at my resume a year from now, what do I have to do? Hell, it doesn't even have to be FAANG. Any tech company would be enough. Or even any reputable company even.

What factors should I weigh before making a decision?\n\nEdit: If I do take the package, my plan is to grind Leetcode full-time and look for a better role. I’ve already been preparing the last few months after realizing there’s really no path for promotion here and there was already 1 round of layoff happened earlier this year.

The demos made it look like you’d just write a prompt and it would crank out production-ready code with perfect architecture. Even our CTO was pushing us to “experiment aggressively.”\n\nAnd sure sometimes it does help. Boilerplate, tests, refactors I’m too lazy to do at 11 PM. No complaints there.\n\nBut for real design or new features? It’s like pair programming with an overeager intern who refuses to say “I don’t know.” It’ll confidently scaffold something that compiles but is subtly wrong in ways that bite you later. Error handling missing. Boundaries between services fuzzy. Or it’ll suggest a “quick fix” that completely ignores the ADR you spent two days writing.\n\nIt’s not just that it’s wrong sometimes but it’s that it’s convincingly wrong. Which is worse than useless when you’re moving fast.\n\nI’ve even had to consciously dial back my use of it on one of our event-driven services because I noticed I was rubber-stamping suggestions instead of thinking about the architecture myself. \n\nAnyway just curious if anyone else has had the same arc.

This was surprising to me because he's normally one of the most sought-after professors at the school, where his wait-lists were always 20+ people.\n\nHe said that this also happened to another CS professor there, where several classes in total were cut due to limited interest, and also said that his wait-lists and enrollments had decreased significantly.\n\nWhile this is anecdotal in nature, just thought I'd share!",

Folding clothes, scanning barcodes, dealing with customers who yell at me over coupons. Meanwhile, I’m watching my classmates post on LinkedIn about their shiny new jobs at big companies. Some even got roles before graduating.\n\nI’m applying like crazy. Dozens of resumes, tailored cover letters, trying to learn new stuff on the side (CompTIA, some Python). I’ve even offered to volunteer with local nonprofits just to build experience — nothing yet.\n\nI can’t help but feel like I missed something. Like I took the \"safe\" path, got the degree, but forgot to do all the extra stuff that actually makes you hirable.\n\nIf you’ve been here — working a non-tech job post-grad, trying to break in — what helped you make the jump? How do you stay motivated when it feels like you’re falling behind?\n\nThanks for reading. I’m not giving up — just need to know others have made it out of this too.",

        "content": "I'm 48 years old in the USA and wondering if it's too late for a career change. I have been at my very small(less than 20 employees) non-tech company 19 years, and for the last 15 of those years I have been solely responsible for both developing our customer facing applications and managing the infrastructure they run on. I shifted the entire company's tech from a closet in the office to AWS in 2017, and in since then our downtime can be measured in minutes. While our company is tiny, we have several very large clients and the applications I have written(mostly in .NET) have scaled well to their often heavy demands. And I painstakingly migrated a few huge, monolithic [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms apps to Razor Pages and Blazor. I am also the sole manager of Active Directory, virtual desktops, etc. \n\nThe good: I am fully remote and make $140,000 a year. Because I have the company's tech basically on auto-pilot I might work ten hours in a busy week. I have no deadlines, no one looking over my shoulder, one pointless meeting a week, and if I need to buy something for the company tech-wise no one even notices. I nominally have a boss, but he's in his late 60's and checked out years ago.\n\nThe bad: I made $135,000 before COVID and I don't see that changing any time soon. No raise this year. I receive no benefits, no bonus, no retirement funding beyond my own contributions. I am fortunate that my wife has a good job and great health insurance so that is not a concern. And even though I don't work a ton of hours, I always need to be available because there is no one else but me to answer customer questions or deal with even the most minor of glitches in the system. I haven't had a full work day off in over an year, even on vacation I always have to do something and be available. There is no budget to hire anyone else. Because neither our employees or clients are technically adept all my interactions with them are on the level of helping my Mom print an email.   \n\nI am concerned about the long term viability of this company and bored out of my mind, but who would hire me? I've never worked on a team. I've never managed anyone. I have no idea how \"real\" companies develop production code. I code in Visual Studio, push to Github which kicks off an AWS Codepipeline, done. Nobody checks my work. We don't have budgets. I don't know what a pull request is and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.\n\nI plan to retire by 62 so I know the easy answer is to just ride this out until then but like I said, I don't know that the company will be around that long. So I guess I'm in that phase where I feel too old and outdated to do anything else but still too young to retire... but doing nothing is becoming scarier by the day.",

How am I going to keep learning and growing in this field when even just showing up is so damn hard sometimes?\n\nSo, yeah — I just need to know: are there others like me?

It doesn't mean that you cannot get a job in the tech industry, but it would be a more difficult path in some career fields. Most students who pursue the BA are usually looking to bring an understanding of tech into a less technical field (like in Psychology, for example). \n\n  \n[https://www.unlv.edu/provost/svpaa/accreditation](https://www.unlv.edu/provost/svpaa/accreditation)",

Every framework or library we produce aims to reduce the amount of work we have to spend to achieve some result.\n\nThe western world represents  15-20% of the population, and we can imagine the remaining 80% catching up will keep on producing more and more engineers as years go by, especially as long as IT is considered the holy grail of sure employment and high pay.\n\nWith software being shipped at light speed, and a single software being usable by billions of users around the world, i'm wondering if we will not hit a ceiling ? A moment where, full stop, we'll have too many CS trained people, and every extra million trained CS graduate will mean an extra million CS trained person not working in a CS related field.

My boss flips over the paper when it comes around to discussion of my salary. He knows it will come back to me and doesnt want anyone to know I accepted something so low.

During my masters I started to go down the self-taught dev route. Now I have been working for 2 years as IT consultant and software developer in an enterprise environment (Java Spring Boot). Currently self-studying CS fundamentals through teachyourselfcs.com (working through CS:APP right now). I'm aware I have some gaps in my CS knowledge, which is why I started the self-study route. Now I'm considering going back to university for a CS Bachelor's degree (would do it part-time while keeping my full-time job. Studying evenings/weekends. Would be at a \"Hochschule\" that costs 19k€).\n\nThe thing is, I could spend those 3.5 years on getting the CS Bachelor's degree OR continuing self-study, building projects, gaining more work experience and getting certifications.\n\nFrom a career perspective, my main question is: What looks better in the (European) job market:\n\n1. Having that CS degree on paper after already working in the field\n2. Having no CS degree, but a few certificates and a couple personal projects and focusing more on my career in the current company.\n\nI'm genuinely torn. Part of me wants the \"proper\" CS foundation and having something to show for it, but another part thinks that time could be better invested in practical experience and targeted learning. Also I would basically just do it for the \"academic proof\" for future employers, as I think that some of the stuff learned during the CS-degree is not practical and the important topics are also learnable by self-study, as I am currently doing.\n\nAnyone been in a similar situation? How did it work out? Would love to hear thoughts from both hiring managers and developers who've taken either path.\n\nThanks!",

Someone else on a different subreddit recommended the [Full Stack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course from the University of Helsinki, which looks comprehensive and touches many modern technologies I am not familiar with, but which could be overkill for someone who is already a developer, I guess.\n\nPlease, I know it might be a boring question, but can you please offer some guidance?

When first learning a topic or getting started everything seems challenging! \n\nJust was wondering if anyone had advice on how to approach this question, or a different way to interpret it so maybe I think of some other projects that I might be underplaying etc.\n\n",

Right now i know basic python ( functions, for loops, numpy, matplotlib, dictionaries, etc). in other words, a beginner. So my question is as follows: given that i will have to teach myself the CS fundamentals, what’s the best path to take? What languages do I need to know, and what resources would you recommend to effectively learn them? As for projects, after my class is done, i will create a LA calculator and a mass-spring model( differential equations). This will integrate my math knowledge with coding, and will be good for me to put on GitHub. Beyond that, i know there’s Leetcode, which is good because i learn best by doing practice problems. My stretch goal is to get a summer 2026 internship in CS, no matter how small. I know that since i’m late to the party, i will have to start small. this is fine by me, i just need my foot in the door. Is this realistic? any advice from someone who was in my shoes? sorry for the stream of consciousness writing… \n",

Don't really like the job and my team isn't technical at all.\n\n# Option 2: Move to Canada for Waterloo’s in-person MEng (includes a co-op term)\n\n* **Cost:** Tuition plus rent and living costs in Waterloo, so I would burn savings (but I can afford it)\n* **Upside:** Waterloo’s name carries weight, and the co-op cycle should drop me into genuine dev roles and help me build a network in Canadian tech\n* **Downside:** Two years of full-time study at age 24, plus the chance I still end up fighting for the same entry-level SWE spots afterward. And the job market is not great so it's a risk.\n\n# About me\n\n* Canadian citizen, CS undergrad (was originally in DS and had my internships in that)\n* Part-time work with two early-stage US startups\n* Contributing to AI research in my spare hours to bulk up the résumé\n* Goal: Land a software engineering job in Canada or the US within the next couple of years\n\n# Anything else I should weigh before picking comfort now versus a riskier move that might unlock better opportunities later?\n\n**What would you do if you were in my shoes?**",

Or a research-based Master's degree? My brief understanding is that here things get blurry because it's more about finding a specific research supervisor and field of research, rather than just trying to get into the highest ranking school you can. \n\nOf course we need a criterion, so I'd say something like 'future career prospect maximization'. \n\nMy concern is that as a mature student with a likely weaker applicant profile, I would probably get into a lower ranking school than my undergrad school.
