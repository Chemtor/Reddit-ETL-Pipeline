What finally worked was treating everything as tables with transactions ‚Äì one namespace, clear schema for samples, runs, evals, and lineage. I snapshot first, then measure, so numbers don‚Äôt drift. Queues are data-aware: group by token length or expected latency, retry per row. After this, fewer mystery bugs, better GPU use, cleaner comparisons.\n\nHe wrote his view here: [https://tracto.ai/blog/better-data-infra](https://tracto.ai/blog/better-data-infra)\n\nDoes anyone here run AI workloads on transactional, table-first storage instead of files?

There was basically no documentation at all, and the schema was a mess, moreover, the database was huge, thousands of fields and hundred of tables.\n\n Here are some examples of bad design: \n\n* No foreign keys defined between tables that clearly had relationships.\n* Some tables had a column that just stored the *name* of another table to indicate a link (instead of a proper relation).\n* Other tables existed in total isolation, but were obviously meant to be connected.\n\nTo deal with it, I literally had to spend my weeks opening each table, looking at the data, and trying to guess its purpose, then writing comments and documentation as I went along.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* Is this kind of challenge (analyzing and documenting undocumented databases) something you often encounter in data engineering / data science work?\n* If you‚Äôve faced this situation before, how did you approach it? Did you have strategies or tools that made the process more efficient than just manual exploration?",

        "content": "I work in a shop where we used to build data warehouses with Informatica PowerCenter.  We moved to a cloud stack years back and implemented these complex transformations into Scala in Databricks although we have been doing more and more Pyspark.  Over time, we've had issues deploying new gold-tier models in our medallion architecture.  Whenever there are highly complex transformations, it takes us a lot longer to develop and deploy. Data quality is lower. Even with lineage graphs, we cannot answer quickly and well for complex derivations if someone asks how we came up with a value in a field.  Nothing we do on our new stack compared to the speed and quality when we used to have a good GUI-based ETL tool.  Basically myself and 1 other team member could build data warehouses quickly and after moving to the cloud, we have tons of engineers and it takes longer with worse results.\n\nWhat we are considering now is to continue using Databricks for ingest and maybe bronze/silver layers and when building gold layer models with complex transformations, we use a GUI and cloud-based ETL/ELT solution.  We want something like the old PowerCenter.  Matillion was mentioned.  Also, Informatica has a cloud solution.\n\nAny advice?  What is the best GUI-based tool for ETL/ELT with the most advanced transformations available like what PowerCenter used to have with expression tranformations, aggregations, filtering, complex functions, etc.\n\nWe don't care about interfaces because data will already be in the data lake.  The focus is specifically on very complex transformations and complex business rules and building gold models from silver data.",

My role started off as a support data engineer but in the past few months, my manager has been giving the support team more development tasks since we all wanted to grow our technical skills. I have also been assigned some development tasks in the past few months, mostly fixing a bug or adding validation frameworks in different parts of a production job. \n\nBefore I was the one asking for more challenging tasks and wanted to work on development tasks but now that I have been given the work, I feel like I have only disappointed my manager. In the past few months, I feel like pretty much every PR I merged ended up having some issue that either broke the job or didn‚Äôt capture the full intention of the assigned task. \n\nAt first, I thought I should be testing better. Our testing environments are currently so rough to deal with that just setting them up to test a small piece of code can take a full day of work. Anyway, I did all that but even then I feel like I keep missing some random edge case or something that I failed to consider which ends up leading to a failure downstream. And I just constantly feel so dumb in front of my manager. He ends up having to invest so much time in fixing things I break and he doesn‚Äôt even berate me for it but I just feel so bad. I know people say that if your manager reviewed your code then its their responsibility too, but I feel like I should have tested more and that I should be more holistic in my considerations. I just feel so self-conscious and low on confidence. \n\nThe annoying thing is that the recent validation thing I worked on, we introduced it to other teams too since it would affect their day-to-day tasks but turns out, my current validation framework technically works but it will also result in some false positives that I now need to work on. But other teams know that I am the one who set this up and that I failed to consider something so anytime, these false positives show up (until I fix it), it will be because of me. I just find it so embarrassing and I know it will happen again because no matter how much I test my code, there is always something that I will miss. It almost makes me want to never PR into production and just never write development code, keep doing my support work even though I find that tedious and boring but at least its relatively low stakes‚Ä¶\n\nI am just not feeling very good and doesn‚Äôt help that I feel like I am the only one making these kind of mistakes in my team and being a burden on my manager, and ultimately creating more work for him with my mistakes‚Ä¶Like I think even the new person on the team isn‚Äôt making as many mistakes as I am..",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi all! I work on Daft full-time, and since we just shipped a big feature, I wanted to share what‚Äôs new. Daft‚Äôs been mentioned here a couple of times, so AMA too.\n\nDaft is an open-source Rust-based data engine for multimodal data (docs, images, video, audio) and running models on them. We built it because getting data into GPUs efficiently at scale is painful, especially when working with data sitting in object stores, and usually requires custom I/O + preprocessing setups.\n\nSo what‚Äôs new? Two big things.  \n  \n**1. A new distributed engine for running models at scale**\n\nWe‚Äôve been using Ray for distributed data processing but consistently hit scalability issues. So we switched from using Ray Tasks for data processing operators to running one Daft engine instance per node, then scheduling work across these Daft engine instances. Fun fact: we named our single-node engine ‚ÄúSwordfish‚Äù and our distributed runner ‚ÄúFlotilla‚Äù (i.e. a school of swordfish).\n\nWe now also use [morsel-driven parallelism](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2016/papers/p743-leis.pdf) and dynamic batch sizing to deal with varying data sizes and skew.\n\nAnd we have smarter shuffles using either the Ray Object Store or our new Flight Shuffle (Arrow Flight RPC + NVMe spill + direct node-to-node transfer).  \n  \n**2. Benchmarks for AI workloads**\n\nWe just designed and ran some swanky new AI benchmarks. Data engine companies love to bicker about TPC-DI, TPC-DS, TPC-H performance. That‚Äôs great, who doesn‚Äôt love a throwdown between Databricks and Snowflake.\n\nSo we‚Äôre throwing a new benchmark into the mix for audio transcription, document embedding, image classification, and video object detection. More details linked at the bottom of this post, but tldr¬†Daft is 2-7x faster than Ray Data and 4-18x faster than Spark on AI workloads.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohjpa08jyitf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5109e9cb6a8e9ca435b7ec77f522b1830b4d9a72\n\nAll source code is public.

Full-text search\n2. Location - on-site\n3. Remote - from a given city, US state, EU, etc.\n4. Category - you can check out the data engineering category here:¬†[https://hire.watch/?categories=Data+Engineering](https://hire.watch/?categories=Data+Engineering)\n5.

Currently, I'm fetching data from the YouTube API and storing it in a raw schema table in a Postgres database, with every column stored as a text field except for one. The exception is a column that stores an array of Wikipedia links describing the video.\n\nFor my staging models in DBT, I decided to assign proper data types to all fields and also split the topics column into its own table. However, after reading the DBT documentation and other resources, I noticed it's generally recommended to keep staging models as close to the source as possible.\n\nSo my question is: should I keep the array column unnested in staging and instead move the separation into my intermediate or semantic layer? That way, the topics table (a dimension basically) would exist there.",

The subjects themselves and/or the underlying subject information. Science, finance, etc. There's lots of areas. AI is expected to help breakdown those barriers to increase the consumption of complicated subject matters. \n\nGuess what's required to enable this? ...data. \n\nNot just any data, good data. High integrity data, ultra high integrity data. The higher, the more valuable. Garbage data isn't going to work anymore, in any industry, as the years roll on.\n\nThis isn't just true for those complicated areas, all industries will need better data. \n\nAnyone who wants to be a player in the future is going to have to upgrade and/or completely re-write their existing systems since the vast majority of data systems today produce garbage data. Partly due to businesses in-adequality budgeting for it. There is a good portion of companies that will have to completely restart their data operations, relegating their current data useless and/or obsolete. Operational, transactional, analytical, etc. \n\nThis is just to get high integrity data.

Now lets say that I have this JSON response that consists of pleeeenty of nested data (4 or 5 levels deep of arrays). Now what dlthub does is that it automatically normalizes the data and loads the arrays into subtables. I like this very much, but now upon some reading I found out that the general advice is to stick as much as possible to the raw format of the data, so in this case loading the nested arrays in JSON format in the db, or even loading the whole response as one value to a raw table with one column.\n\nWha do you think about that? What I‚Äôm losing by normalizing it at this step, except the fact that I have a shitton of tables and I guess it‚Äôs impossible to recreate something if  I don‚Äôt like the normalize logic? Am I missing something? I‚Äôm not doing any transformations except this, mind you.\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "I'd like to share a project I've been working on called **Flint**:\n\nFlint transforms data engineering by shifting from custom code to declarative configuration for complete ETL pipeline workflows. The framework handles all execution details while you focus on what your data should do, not how to implement it. This configuration-driven approach standardizes pipeline patterns across teams, reduces complexity for ETL jobs, improves maintainability, and makes data workflows accessible to users with limited programming experience.\n\nThe processing engine is abstracted away through configuration, making it easy to switch engines or run the same pipeline in different environments. The current version supports Apache Spark, with Polars support in development.\n\nIt is not intended to replace all pipeline programming work but rather make straightforward ETL tasks easier so engineers can focus on more interesting and complex problems.\n\nSee an example configuration at the bottom of the post. Check out the repo, star it if you like it, and let me know if you're interested in contributing.\n[GitHub Link: config-driven-ETL-framework](https://github.com/krijnvanderburg/config-driven-ETL-framework)\n\n## Why I Built It\n\nTraditional ETL development has several pain points:\n- Engineers spend too much time writing boilerplate code for basic ETL tasks, taking away time from more interesting problems\n- Pipeline logic is buried in code, inaccessible to non-developers\n- Inconsistent patterns across teams and projects\n- Difficult to maintain as requirements change\n\n## Key Features\n- **Pure Configuration**: Define sources, transformations, and destinations in JSON or YAML\n- **Multi-Engine Support**: Run the same pipeline on Pandas, Polars, or other engines\n- **100% Test Coverage**: Both unit and e2e tests at 100%\n- **Well-Documented**: Complete class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and design principles\n- **Strongly Typed**: Full type safety throughout the codebase\n- **Comprehensive Alerts**: Email, webhooks, files based on configurable triggers\n- **Event Hooks**: Custom actions at key pipeline stages (onStart, onSuccess, etc.)\n\n## Looking for Contributors!\nThe foundation is solid - 100% test coverage, strong typing, and comprehensive documentation - but I'm looking for contributors to help take this to the next level. Whether you want to add new engines, add tracing and metrics, change CLI to use click library, extend the transformation library to Polars,  I'd love your help!\n\nCheck out the repo, star it if you like it, and let me know if you're interested in contributing.\n\n[GitHub Link: config-driven-ETL-framework](https://github.com/krijnvanderburg/config-driven-ETL-framework)\n\n\n```jsonc\n{\n    \"runtime\": {\n        \"id\": \"customer-orders-pipeline\",\n        \"description\": \"ETL pipeline for processing customer orders data\",\n        \"enabled\": true,\n        \"jobs\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"silver\",\n                \"description\": \"Combine customer and order source data into a single dataset\",\n                \"enabled\": true,\n                \"engine_type\": \"spark\", // Specifies the processing engine to use\n                \"extracts\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"extract-customers\",\n                        \"extract_type\": \"file\", // Read from file system\n                        \"data_format\": \"csv\", // CSV input format\n                        \"location\": \"examples/join_select/customers/\", // Source directory\n                        \"method\": \"batch\", // Process all files at once\n                        \"options\": {\n                            \"delimiter\": \",\", // CSV delimiter character\n                            \"header\": true, // First row contains column names\n                            \"inferSchema\": false // Use provided schema instead of inferring\n                        },\n                        \"schema\": \"examples/join_select/customers_schema.json\" // Path to schema definition\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"transforms\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"transform-join-orders\",\n                        \"upstream_id\": \"extract-customers\", // First input dataset from extract stage\n                        \"options\": {},\n                        \"functions\": [\n                            {\"function_type\": \"join\", \"arguments\": {\"other_upstream_id\": \"extract-orders\", \"on\": [\"customer_id\"], \"how\": \"inner\"}},\n                            {\"function_type\": \"select\", \"arguments\": {\"columns\": [\"name\", \"email\", \"signup_date\", \"order_id\", \"order_date\", \"amount\"]}}\n                        ]\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"loads\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"load-customer-orders\",\n                        \"upstream_id\": \"transform-join-orders\", // Input dataset for this load\n                        \"load_type\": \"file\", // Write to file system\n                        \"data_format\": \"csv\", // Output as CSV\n                        \"location\": \"examples/join_select/output\", // Output directory\n                        \"method\": \"batch\", // Write all data at once\n                        \"mode\": \"overwrite\", // Replace existing files if any\n                        \"options\": {\n                            \"header\": true // Include header row with column names\n                        },\n                        \"schema_export\": \"\" // No schema export\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"hooks\": {\n                    \"onStart\": [], // Actions to execute before pipeline starts\n                    \"onFailure\": [], // Actions to execute if pipeline fails\n                    \"onSuccess\": [],  // Actions to execute if pipeline succeeds\n                    \"onFinally\": [] // Actions to execute after pipeline completes (success or failure)\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```",

Pandas made this less than optimal to query fast and still took a fair amount of time to build the flow tree.\n\nMany months of engineering later, I released PyThermite, a fully in memory query engine that indexed pure python objects, not dataframes or arbitrary data proxies. This also means that object attribute updates will automatically update the search index, eliminating the need for multi pass data creation.\n\nhttps://github.com/tylerrobbins5678/PyThermite\n\nPerformance appears be be absolutely destroying pandas and even polars in query performance. 6x -70x on 10M objects objects with a 19 part query. Index / dataframe build performance is significantly slower as expected, but thats the upfront cost with constant time lookup capability.\n\nWhat's everyone's thoughts on this? I am in the ETL space in my career and have always leaned more into the OOP concepts which are discarded in favor of row/col data. Is this a solution thats reusable or just only for those holding onto OOP hope?",

Business will make the updates to records by editing an upstream table via a file upload. I feel that this approach would simplify the SQL logic; a simple coalesce would do the job.

Keep working on the dimensional modelling side of DE, since there is a new project involved in business department. So basically will be working mostly on business understanding & data transformation hence the dimensional model\n2. Move to the DE in IT department & will mostly work with more upstream layer (think bronze layer) & ETL pipelines moving data from different sources\n\nI'm currently more inclined towards choice 1, but what do you guys think about the future prospects?\n\nThanks in advance",

        "content": "Background:\n\nI‚Äôve been working as a Data Engineer for about 3.5 years, mainly on data migrations and warehouse engineering for analytics.\n\nEven though I‚Äôm still technically a junior, for the last couple of years I‚Äôve worked on fairly big projects with a lot of responsibility, often figuring things out on my own and delivering without much help.\n\nI‚Äôm on ¬£40k and recently started doing a degree alongside work. I‚Äôm in a decent position to move up.\n\nThe company is big but my team is small (1 manager, 1 senior, 2 juniors). It‚Äôs generally a good place to work, though promotions and recognition are quite slow ‚Äî most people move internally to progress. As the other junior and senior are on a single project, I'm doing all others currently.\n\nI normally get bored after about a year in a job, but I‚Äôve been here for 2 years and still enjoy most of the work despite a few frustrations.\n\nCurrent situation:\nMy girlfriend lives in Germany (we‚Äôve been together for 4 years), and I want to move there. My current job doesn‚Äôt allow working abroad, so I‚Äôll need to find something a way to make it happen. I do fortunately have EU citizenship\n\nI‚Äôve had a few opportunites in Germany. Some looked promising but didn‚Äôt work out (e.g. they needed someone to start immediately, or misrepresented parts of the process). Overall, though, I seem to get decent interest.\n\nMain issue:\n\nA lot of roles in Germany require a degree (I‚Äôm working on one but don‚Äôt have it yet).\nMany jobs also want fluent German. Mine is still pretty basic, but I‚Äôm learning.\n\nI'm considering:\nEU contracting - I like the idea of doing different projects every 6‚Äì12 months while living in Germany. I haven‚Äôt looked properly into the legal/tax side yet, but it sounds like it could fit well.\n\nBuilding a product/startup-  I‚Äôve built a very basic MVP that provides analytics (including some predictive analysis) for small‚Äìmid sized e-commerce companies. It‚Äôs early, but I think it could be developed into more of a template/solution to offer as a service potentially.\n\nCareer progression - I don‚Äôt want to stay as a junior any longer and its so low priority for the company currently. I want to keep build towards something bigger but feel like times not on my side\n \n\nI‚Äôm juggling a lot right now: work, uni, the product idea, and the thought of switching to contracting and moving abroad. I want to move things forward without getting stuck in the same place for too long or burning out trying to do everything at once.\n\nAny advice on \n\n* Moving to Germany as a data professional without fluent German\n* Whether EU contracting is a good stepping stone or just a distraction right now\n* If it‚Äôs smarter to build the product before or after relocating\n* General advice on avoiding career stagnation while juggling multiple priorities\n\n\nTL;DR:\n3.5 yrs as a Data Engineer, junior title, ¬£40k, started a degree. Want to move to Germany (girlfriend), progress career, maybe try contracting or build a startup/product. Feels like a lot to juggle and I don‚Äôt want to get stuck.

Operating systems, protocols, programming languages, databases‚Äîmuch of it originated or matured during that era.\n\nWhat's crazy is that these developers had limited computing power, no Stack Overflow, no VSCode, no GitHub Copilot... and yet, they built Unix, TCP/IP, C, early Linux, compilers, text editors, early web browsers, and more. Even now, we study their work to understand how things actually function under the hood.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\nWhat did they actually learn back then that made them capable of such deep work?\n\nWas it just \"computer science basics\" or something more?\n\nDid having fewer abstractions make them better engineers because they had to understand everything from the metal up?\n\nIs today's developer culture too reliant on tools and frameworks, while they built things from scratch?\n\nI'm genuinely curious‚Äîdid the limitations of the time force them to think differently, or are we missing something in how we approach learning today?\n\nWould love to hear from people who were around back then or who study that era.

But learning to *read* code well is just as important as writing it. I have a few actionable tips to get started with reading code\n\n* Make a mental map of the functions:\n   *  When your going through the code always try a high level outline of the file and then build on that towards. Like for example, start at the top of the file and go through the functions clicking on them to go towards the source code\n* Run the code through a debugger :\n   * One of the underrated ways to understand a codebase is to run the code that you are reading through a debugger. Attach a breakpoint and the simulate running the code, you will understand the flow of the code extremely well.\n* Start from the test cases:\n   * If the project has test cases, that‚Äôs your entry point. Run them and *watch what happens*.\n      * What objects are being created?\n      * Which functions are called first?\n      * What files are imported?\n\nLearning to read code well takes time. You won‚Äôt understand everything the first time and that‚Äôs okay. But if you repeat this process across 3/4 small projects, your brain starts to see code structure naturally.",

But for me, it's still work. I'm not a full-blooded developer who sits down after work and develops something himself or listens to tech podcasts. I have other hobbies such as sports, friends, crafts, etc. And that makes me feel bad because I have the impression that 99% of the people in this profession are people who are passionate about programming and that it is also their biggest hobby. It seems that most of them still have private projects, are familiar with many more technologies, and are interested in these topics outside of work as well. I can't imagine doing something like that regularly in my private life after working 40-45 hours a week. That would completely ruin it for me and take away all the fun. However, I know of very few professions where this is expected so often. However, the situation also causes my imposter syndrome to become greater. \n(Apart from that, I don't understand how people manage to find so much time for it alongside family, friends, household chores, sports, and possibly other hobbies.)\n\nHow is it for you? Do you finish work at the end of the day, or do you sit down and do something else?\n",

I don't understand why router would have to go though looking into layer 3, and instead of just giving layer 3 info to switch, it has to encapsulate it again and give layer 2 packet to the switch for it to work properly.\n\nI know switch requires the mac address to operate and it is layer 2 thing.

What will be more beneficial here? Is it moving forward with CS50 or TOP or starting the C++ book as originally intended?\n\nI've always seen this idea reiterated quite often that choosing a programming language for a novice is not as important as it is to choose a good course that teaches the fundamentals of programming. But then you would eventually loose your time re-learning your target language. So I'm a bit confused and wanted to hear the opinions of intermediate and experienced programmers on this particular statement.\n\nDo you agree with this mentality of learning the fundamentals without being hyper-fixated about the language or do you think that learning your target language is more important from the get-go?\n\nThanks in advance <3",

I've researched as best I can, eaten up tutorials and free resources and even yr vids. I practice in vs code and use github for projects and spare codes. But I feel overwhelmed and a little lost.\n\nIm trying not to make it abou5 getting a job ( career change, currently unemployed and desperate) But it's difficult due to how inter3sted i am.\n\nIll get these days that I hyperfocus and jsut go down the rabbit hole and what I end up with it.... a mess tbh.\n\nMy question is - do any long term programmers/endgineers/web devs have legit, concrete advice that worked for them when learning?\n\nI don't want handouts. I like the struggle (masochist >,>) But I honestly feel like I need a direction.\n\nMi first goal is to build a personal website as a holding place for my tentative projects, amateur blog of my learning process and what has helped me, and maybe a few scattered real like things in there too. I also plan to add in a section for gaming suggestions such as custom content, add-ons, guides etc\nAs well as a resources of various things\n\nIt's all a long term goal. \n\nIm attempting to learn basic vanilla html,css, and javascript first before delving deep into any frameworks\n I like to have a basic understanding of beat practices and why's first. \n\n\nBut again... ADHD messing with my brain. Overwhelmed. Jittery. Want to do ALL THE THINGS AT ONCE.\n\nSo... does anyone have ANG suggestion of how to begin this hefty project and maybe break it down into easily digestible pieces???\n\nId so appreciate it you have NO idea.\n\n\nEDIT - UPDATE:: Thank you everyone so much for the honesty and helpful advice. It feels great to have people with far far more experience reach out and give tips. I seriously appreciate it. Especially considering when I made this post, I did it during an adhd spiral. I get far too honest and far too chatty without even considering the ramifications later. \n\nSo I very much appreciate everyone's reply. I will be taking notes and keeping them all in mind! It definitely helps me put things into perspective and helps me figure out how and where to start with my own projects.",

However, while doing research to see what sort of skills I would need to build this, I started learning about APIs, and then saw that many of them charge.\n\nFor example, Nutritionix looks like a good source to pull from, but it appears to only support two active users on the free plan.\n\nIf I was to build this app, and make it open source, would it be possible to have the user download:\n1.

I have most of the skills necessary when it comes to this like 3d modeling, drawing, animation and sound. However I lack the most essential skill, coding. I use unity, which means I code in c#, and I have tried learning it so many times but every time i have tried to learn either I resort to chatgpt or other peoples code or i just give up. I feel terrible using chatgpt because its just not good, it ruins a game because it was made by a clanker ai robot instead of a real human being and I don't want to be like that, but every time I have ever tried to make a game or learn how to code I have given up. The furthest I have learnt in c# right now is variables, logic gates, events and basic 2d movement along with rigidbody 2d movement but nothing else, and I just want to give up all the time and have been giving up then trying again then giving up over and over and over for the past like 4 years and idk what to do at this point. So if anybody has a solution please pretty please with a cherry on top tell me. Youtube videos never worked for me, i tried learning with chatgpt, that didn't work either, i have talked to other people who know how to code and that didnt work, just about nothing works for me. I even wrote notes on c# in my book and thats how I know about variables, logic gates, events etc but theres honestly so much crap in coding i just get lost :(",

Or is it going to be a waste of my time? Is it a skill worth learning? Is it a skill in the first place? Do employers actually care?\n\nI'm really curious and haven't been able to gather much from my supervisor as he is primarily a computer scientist and has never really been in the industry before. And I was scrolling through the previous senior projects that were done in my uni and pretty much none even attempted it, so I'm not really sure.",

The if statement is checking if `write - read` is positive, which would happen if, in the diagram, write is to the right of read. Yet the comment above this `if` is the opposite. \n\n2) The last line doesn't make sense when walking through an example. Let's say the buffer is of size 8, with the write pointer at 2 and the read pointer at 5, so it looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/C3Q6hHI\n\nthis would mean write - read is -3, so that if statement would be false. The function would then return `size - write + read` which would be `8 - 2 + 5` ==> `11`.  \n\nThis does *not* seem right. The length of the data of a buffer of size 8 can't be 11.\n\n\nAm I just totally misunderstanding something here??",

I instantly loved it , it felt meaningful, impactful, and technically interesting. So I jumped in, did a good bit of research, and started thinking about how I could make it my own.\n\nAt first, my plan was to:\n\n* Build a basic sign language recognition system using a webcam, Python, and OpenCV.\n* Expand the word library beyond the typical 10-20 signs.\n* Focus specifically on Irish Sign Language (ISL) to localize it more.\n\nBut as I kept researching, I realized I might‚Äôve been on the wrong side of the internet early on, because it turns out that projects like this have already been done a *lot*. My additions (more words, ISL focus) don‚Äôt really feel like enough to count as a real advancement or innovation, especially for a final year project.\n\nI then thought: what if I added a region detection feature? Something that could detect which sign language dialect is being used (e.g., ASL vs BSL vs ISL). But again, the more I dig, the more I see that similar ideas have been explored ‚Äî and I'm starting to feel like I‚Äôm just re-inventing existing wheels without offering anything new.\n\nTo be honest, I‚Äôm really stuck now,  I‚Äôve backed myself into a project that‚Äôs been done too many times already, and I‚Äôm not sure how to meaningfully innovate it.\n\nI would love some advice on this, what more can i add, and should i just give up. If you guys have any other ideas i could do instead, that would be amazing.\n\nThank you",

        "content": "I only lurk on Reddit, but I have to ask. Is it possible to be too dumb to learn C and low level programming? \n\nFor reference, I am in college getting a degree in IT. My degree is generally more networking, infrastructure, and cybersecurity than computer science. The only computer science classes I have to take have been in python, a web development class, and an Intro to Computer Systems class in C. I did well in web development, and I absolutely LOVED the classes in python. C has been a different animal. \n\nI had to work SO hard to barely pass Intro to Computer Systems. The content was kind of interesting, but it was a ton of work. I made it though. I decided that low level just wasn't for me and moved on. \n\nLast year, I got to take a Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation class. It was all in C, but we didn't do any actual development in C. We only reverse engineered C code, then wrote exploits in assembly or hex. I loved this class as well. It was super hard, but I really enjoyed learning about how the exploits worked. The class was geared towards security researchers, which is not what I want to do, but I still loved it. \n\nMy university's computer science program recently started an Operating Systems Development class, based on MIT's xv6 operating system (RISC-V). I decided to give low level development (specifically C) a second chance, but it has not been going well. The content is interesting, but I genuinely feel too stupid to learn it. The lectures feel impossible to follow, and the labs generally take me about twice as long to complete as other students. \n\nI mostly decided to take this class to learn more about a topic I probably wouldn't learn on my own, and I don't need this class to graduate. Regardless, I don't want to drop the class. I feel like I \"can\" do it, but its been so hard. It's kinda making me think that I might just not be smart enough to do low level programming, and that I should stick to the higher level stuff where I do better. \n\nIs it possible to not be smart enough? Or am I just making a big deal out of a skill issue? I enjoy learning about the content, but it takes me so long to get the labs done. Even after I complete them, I usually don't fully understand why my bug fixes work. I try to research them, but get lost in the sauce a little bit. ",

        "content": "I am learning backend by developing a simple URL shortener project. The goal of this project is to learn and try to do things in simple but better ways. I have two things in mind that I need some advice/suggestions on\n\nTech stack: Python, FastAPI, Postgres, SQLAlchemy\n\n1. How to handle click events (URL clicks used for simple analytics)?\n2. How to handle sequentially related operations? For example, if a User is deactivated, all the URLs of that user should be deactivated\n\nThis is the way I started to think and improvise:\n\nAs a beginner, updating the DB step by step is the usual way. The user clicks a short URL, and the click is registered in the DB (url\\_id, clicked\\_at, any other metadata), and then the redirection happens. Now this is a typical setup, but this may work for a few users. When I think of thousands or even millions of users, this won‚Äôt work. Yes, I can think of scaling the infrastructure, but DB operations are costly, and I need to only think about the important DB updates. When I was reading about this, I came across the concept of eventual consistency. I wanted to know how these things can be done, and came across using tasks in the background. Important updates can be done in the DB, and the rest can be pushed to the task queue to perform later. This was the basic idea I thought of. (Read Celery)\n\nNow coming to 1), I have a clicks table, and I just record the clicks. Now, for a few users, direct DB insert is fine, but for many users, this will be a bottleneck. Using a task for each click is overkill. Then I thought, can I use some sort of buffer which captures clicks in bulk and then pushes a task for a bulk update? Now the question is what to use? The read should be quick, so Redis comes into the picture, but persistence is an issue. Clicks are important data, accuracy can be debated. I can use Redis persistence mechanisms to manage it, but is this the right way to do it? Redis captures the clicks metadata. I will have a periodic task to scan the Redis, if there is any data, I fetch it in chunks and bulk update the DB. This looks good, but is there a better way to do it? When I looked into this, I came across event-driven architecture and Kafka. All these things went over my head, as I am just doing a simple project in a mono repo modular way. Please suggest any other ways to achieve this in a simpler and better way.\n\nComing to 2), I have a user table, which has the user status. When a user deactivates, all the URLs related to that user should also be deactivated. For a few users, updating user status and then updating URL status is a typical setup, but thinking on scale, this is not feasible. Suppose 1000 users deactivate at a time, each user having 100 URLs, updating all at once will take time. What I thought was to update the user status and let the frontend show it. This is the UI level update for user consistency. The URL updates can be delayed, maybe using tasks. I thought of using per-user tasks. User deactivates, user status is updated, and a deactivate task is pushed to the queue. If the queue has fewer tasks, and workers aren't busy, then every task will be quickly done. But what if the user's status changes before the task is executed? Say the user logged in and the user is active, again, I push a task to reactivate URLs. So in a very small period of time, the user status went from active to deactivated to active again. Status is unchanged, but the URL status changed twice through two tasks, which wasn‚Äôt required. These cases may be rare, but I have to consider them. So to manage this, I can have a simple table to keep track of status using versions. Start with 1, and then update when the status changes. For the URL, I just keep track of the last user status version which updated the URL status. So I have (user\\_status\\_version, last\\_user\\_status\\_version\\_url\\_update). When I push a task, I send the user version as the task version and then check if there is any URL update needed. Task just checks the task version and user version with the last update URL version to make URL status changes if needed. This works fine, but now the question is, if there are a huge number of users, can the task queue be overloaded? Then I thought of having a scheduled task which runs periodically. Here, I focus on the current state of the user status. For this, I need to maintain a table with (user\\_id, status, version, updated\\_at). All the status updates will be recorded here per user. The task will check for version differences, fetch the current user status and then make necessary changes only if required. In both methods, I have to access the DB. Is there a way to avoid this? Maybe have a buffer to store the actions for some time and then process them in bulk. Same as in 1), I thought of using Redis as an intermediate data store. A task will run periodically and check for Redis entries, if present, they will be fetched and pushed as a task to the queue to process them and update the database. Processing can be made efficient further with looping chunks or multiple tasks processing different chunks of data, etc.\n\nThese are the ideas which I could think of. Are there any other ways of doing it? Feel free to suggest/advise or provide any resources. Please correct me if my thinking is wrong, I'm trying to learn as much as possible.",

        "author": "m477h145h3rm53n",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm searching for a very flexible data structure being able to describe what data to fetch from an API ( assuming I would own that API by creating a custom wrapper plugin ). The data itself is quite easy to fetch but the filters are very complex because the client domain is fully customizable.\n\nThe system\n========\nGiven an external project-based system. Each project contains multiple entities of different types ( e.g. *risk*, *hazard*, ... ). Each entity got an `id` field and can have additional custom fields ( e.g. *name*, *description*, ... ). It is possible to link entities via link definitions ( e.g. *hazard* **belongs to** *risk* ), so one entity is pointing to others.\n\nhttps://i.sstatic.net/lWWf5z9F.png\n\nReading data via system GUI\n========\nThe system itself provides 2 approaches to display data in its own GUI\n\n- writing raw SQL\n- providing a [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) query string\n\nBoth approaches work for the most cases but complex queries are not possible. If the SQL query is too complex, the system won't execute it ( because of security reasons ), some SQL statements got blacklisted. Same for the Lucene query, you can only query very basic information. If you want to read complex data you have to write a custom Java plugin and query the database on your own.\n\nMy current solution\n========\nThere are several domains that require different domain specific queries ( e.g. Risk management, Cyper security, ... )\n\nSince I want to read complex data and visualize it in a table I thought it could be useful to separate the transformed UI data from the raw fetching data.\n\nSo a very simple UI might look like this \n\n| Risks | Risks | Hazards |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| render some fields of Risk 1 | render other fields of Risk 1 | render Hazard 1 |\n\nAs you can see one entity can be displayed differently in multiple columns. But since we only want to read it once ( to calculate a tree representing a table matrix ) I thought data sources would do the trick.\n\nA single data source describes which data to load. It is a pool of entities with their fields. There must be a leading data source and there can be a list of following data sources depending on each other.\n\n```ts\ndataSources: {\n  leading: {\n    id: \"unique-id\", // a unique ID for the data source\n    entityTypeIds: [ \"entityType-1\", \"entityType-2\" ], // describe which types to load\n    fieldIds: [ \"field-1\" ], // only fetch the desired custom fields\n  },\n  following: [{\n    // ... following DS extends the leading DS ...\n    dependsOn: {\n      dataSourceId: \"id-of-the-related-data-source\", // point to the other data source ( e.g. leading )\n      relation: { // describe the link definition\n        typeId: \"has\", // the ID of the link definition\n        sourceIs: \"other\" // which direction to use? ( can be \"me\" or \"other\" )\n      }\n    }\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nEach data source loads entities with their fields based on its configuration. Related following data sources load entities based on the relation and the final result will be a data graph.\n\nNow this approach comes with some limitations:\n\n- You have to be sure that each field ID exists for each entity type\n- You have to be sure that the defined link definition matches each entity type of the related data source\n- leading data will be fetched from the current project only but related data will be fetched from everywhere ( no limits )\n \nTo add a filter to a data source I had a look at [MongoDB filter expressions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/eq/) and created my own simple filters, e.g.\n\n```ts\n// Comparison operators ( equals )\n{\n    \"$eq\": [\"fieldId\", \"value\"]\n}\n\n// Logical operators ( and | not | or )\n{\n    \"$and\": [] // Expecting other filters, e.g. comparison operators\n}\n```\n\nWhen it comes to very complex filtering, e.g.\n\n> Pick risk if linked to any hazard and at least one hazard is of category biological \n\nthe only way I solved it was to hardcode some filter steps in the backend code and define them inside an action\n\n```ts\n// Filter action \n{\n    name: \"my filter action\", // the name of the backend method\n    param1: ...,\n    param2: ...,\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nWith all the information the backend is able to process data source by data source ( \"column wise\" ) but my approach not ideal. Traversing 3000 risks with a generic SQL query ( by transforming the basic filters ) and applying filter methods on them is very slow. The external system is slow itself so rendering a table with ~30 columns and maybe 50 rows can take up to 1 minute ( depends on domain complexity ). ~5 seconds is considered \"fast\".\n\nI'm looking for a very generic data structure to describe exactly what I want in one run ( if possible )\n\n> Lessons learned: I think it's to slow to process data source by data source ( column wise ) because the UI has to wait everything to be fetched. It might be better to create a structure that resolves a whole \"UI\" row ( all data sources together ) because the backend could stream row by row so the client could start rendering some results earlier.\n\nSo I'm thinking about overhauling the whole application in terms of flexibility and performance.\n\n\"improve existing structure\" idea\n========\n\nAs little dynamic as possible with a clear mapping\n\n```ts\n// Leading Entity DataSource\n{\n  \"projectID-1\": { // define project ID\n    \"entityTypeID-1\": { // define entity type ID\n      // define entity configuration ( e.g. fields )\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Following Entity To Entity DataSource ( one to one mapping )\n{\n  \"parent-projectID-1\": { // define parent project ID\n    \"parent-entityTypeID-1\": { // define parent entity type ID\n      \"parent-linkDefinitionID-1\": { // define link definition ID\n        fromTypes: { // specific link direction ( opposite is toTypes )\n          \"projectID-1\": { // define project ID\n            \"entityTypeID-2\": { // define entity type ID\n              // define entity configuration ( e.g. fields )\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis structure gives you a lot more flexibility and the backend exactly knows what to do. Unfortunately I wasn't able to solve the filter part yet. How should I tell the backend\n\n> Pick this one if its status is \"open\" or if it's linked with ... which has 5 descendants and at least 2 descendants have at least one linked child of type biological.\n\nReading every risk and applying a filter which checks every hazard relative to this risk can cause a massive slowdown ( when having many data sources )\n\n\"use SQL\" idea\n========\n\nIt would be easy to create a custom SQL string and pass it to the backend plugin which passes the SQL query to the system. \n\nUnfortunately this is not possible because\n\n- The system would block complex queries\n- There are no permission checks anymore\n\n\"use Lucene\" idea\n========\n\nOne could create a Lucene query string. While Lucene itself allows arbitrarily complex logical structures, the system enforces a few practical restrictions:\n\n- Security & Performance:\nExtremely deep nesting or very long OR chains (e.g., thousands of values) may be rejected by the system\n\n- Syntax filtering:\nThe system only supports a subset of Lucene‚Äôs query syntax (for example, no wildcards in field names, no custom analyzer queries)\n\n- Fixed field names:\nYou can only query fields that the system has indexed (e.g., type, status, severity, assignee, project, created, etc.)\n\nComplex queries not only check for field values but also for graphs and Lucene is not a graph database system.\n\n\"filters\" idea\n========\n\nThink of everything being a ( known ) filter\n\n```ts\n// caution: this filter structure needs to be logically nested inside AND / OR / NOT\n{\n    /*\n        Glob Pattern, e.g.\n        \"100\" => Project 100 only\n        \"!100\" => All projects except 100\n        \"100|200\" => Project 100 or 200 only\n        \"*\" => All projects\n    */\n    projectID: \"100\",\n    entityTypeID: \"risk\", // Glob pattern similiar to project ID\n    // ... additional filters ...\n}\n```\n\nThis might work but it takes some time to resolve the request. And for now I didn't find a good structure for a very complex domain filter.\n\n---\n\nMy questions:\n-----\n\nIs there a standard query language solving this? I want to avoid inventing my own query language.\n\nDo you have any ideas how to create a generic structure being able to solve complex domain cases?",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI got a programming assignment for a job interview, in which I need to refactor old code. Now, I've gone crazy on this code for the past few days and went all-in to changing the interfaces of the methods provided to refactor. However, it got me wondering. Would I get punished for this or criticised?\n\nThe way I look at it, when refactoring code, it's normal for some interfaces to break, which would necessitate more refactoring in other places. Of course, I've only been given a snippet, so I wouldn't be able to estimate how much impact the changing of the interfaces has.",

Great company and great people however while I'm producing work that meets their standards and doing so in a timely manner, I feel like I'm not learning much C++.\n\nMuch of what I do is in Blueprint not because C++ isn't use, it heavily is but whenever a problem surfaces, I end up just taking the blueprint route simply due to it being easier, way less time consuming and less intimidating. Also, when I try to do c++ work, I end up copying/repurposing existing code rather than writing something mostly fresh like I would in blueprint.\n\nI understand I could just start doing more tasks in c++ but that doesn't always seem like the most optimal and efficient way to do things, especially when performance gains are negligible.\n\nAm I right to feel this way? Or should I invest more time in c++ even if I fall behind on my tasks?",

I've gotten a bit too used to asking AI for helping with building, coding, debugging, or problem-solving, and I do miss the deeper learning feeling.\n\nI'd love to hear from you all - how did you manage to break out of that habit or if you had been in my situation, how did you find a way to use AI more wisely while learning stuff? How do you balance using AI as a learning tool without letting it do too much of the work for you?\n\nI did or used to try to ask AI specific questions to learn from it, but honestly, it often feels faster to just let it handle things while I guide and review the output.

I would read books, do side projects, keep up with the latest news and trends. My goal at the time was eventually become a staff/principal level dev earning 150-200k a year 10 years down the road. My hard work eventually paid off, I went from a no-name school to a few scrappy startups to better mid level company and eventually hit a big tech remote job. Been here three years now and I'm honestly content. Old me would have pushed for a promotion by year 1 (with an expectation of failure but that's okay! I tried to get internships my first semester in school too lol). I thought I'd \"rest\" from the grind for a bit and now 3 years have passed. Will probably reach year 4 without a promotion though my compensation has grown quite a bit regardless. I don't even interview around anymore (as that's one way to get to senior too!) Part of it seems to be that, from a compensation stand point, I had reached the upper band of my goal the moment I got the big tech job and am now at a point where I overshot it by more than 50%. I absolutely do not have the momentum to reach staff/principal in the next 5 years anymore.\n\nAnyone in the same boat? Anyone who was in the same boat and got out of it?

All new hires are now being made in India, and there have been a few layoffs here in the US, even though the company‚Äôs financial health remains strong.\n\nGiven the ongoing uncertainty surrounding H1B visas, I‚Äôve decided that moving to India is the best choice for both my personal and professional stability. I approached management about transferring to our India office so I can be closer to my aging parents and have some peace of mind. While they expressed full support for the move, there‚Äôs a condition: they want me to build a new team in India.\n\nI can‚Äôt help feeling conflicted about this. I genuinely care about my US team, and I worry that some of them might face layoffs as a consequence of these changes. It‚Äôs a difficult situation, balancing my personal needs with my responsibilities toward my colleagues.\n\nAt the end of the day, H1B isn‚Äôt really the problem here, it‚Äôs outsourcing and the global cost-cutting strategies like GCC that are driving these shifts.",

This is obviously against the countless clarification that's been published, so I asked where heard that. They said company announcement and emails from the law firm that the company pays.\n\nThat's why Big Tech has is keeping its mouth shut about the 100k H1B fees. It won't affect the majority of their hiring, not transfers, not F1, etc. but they can use the panic to insinuate that it does to suppress wages. \"You should be grateful we're paying this fee, and other employers might not when you switch jobs.\" You didn't pay shit, and neither would anyone else. \"Now we have to pay everyone less to cover the fees, blah blah blah bs\"\n\nThe 100k \"fee\" is a win for Big Tech because their hiring is untouched by it and allows them to keep wages low by manipulating their H1Bs into thinking switching cost is even higher. I bet they're actively lobbying for the fee to apply to job switch. Anyone else seeing this bullshit?",

I graduated in April, started looking in July, and now officially start in an entry level DevOps position at an F500 company.\n\nIn totally I applied to around 180 jobs. Got two companies (including this one) to interview me. Believe it or not I originally got rejected for a different position in this company the first time due to lack of space. However, because I left a good impression with the original teams I eventually got the role after interviewing a second and third time (2 roles, 2 departments, 3 teams, and 12 managers, all in person. All on separate days).\n\nI honestly originally wanted to be a full-stack dev, but after hearing about the DevOps role I think this'll be something I really enjoy. Here's to a hopefully successful launch!\n\nETA: Resume for anyone interested: https://imgur.com/a/xRCsTwH",

        "content": "Earlier this year, I shared a post about my *brutal job search season* ‚Äî 7 years of experience, 0 offers, and a Sankey diagram of all my failures. At that time, I was struggling to get traction despite a ton of effort, and the funnel felt brutal. (For anyone curious, here‚Äôs the old post: [Brutal Job Search Season Recap - 7 YOE, 0 Offers, and a Sankey Diagram of My Failures : r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1irlf8b/brutal_job_search_season_recap_7_yoe_0_offers_and/))\n\nThis time around, things went much better. With \\~7.5 years of experience at a major cloud company, I decided to give the market another shot, and the difference was noticeable. I ended up landing **5 job offers, all at a higher level than my current role**, and had far more interview opportunities with larger, well-known companies compared to my last search.\n\n**What Changed Since Last Time:**\n\n* **Market conditions:** Hiring still isn‚Äôt easy, but compared to earlier this year, there‚Äôs clearly more activity. The bar is high, but not *as impossibly high*.\n* **Interview prep:** I doubled down on my weak spots. Coding used to be my #1 rejection reason. I kept grinding on patterns, mock interviews, and actually slowing down to talk through my thinking. That helped a lot.\n* **Mindset:** Last time, every rejection hit me hard. This time, I treated each round as ‚Äújust another rep,‚Äù which helped me stay consistent across system design and behavioral interviews.\n\n**Results:**\n\n* Multiple onsites and final-round loops.\n* 5 actual offers on the table (finally!).\n* A more balanced funnel: coding wasn‚Äôt the auto-fail it used to be, and system design performance felt steadier.\n\n**Takeaways:**\n\n1. The market does ebb and flow. Timing matters more than we admit.\n2. Interviewing is a skill that compounds. The ‚Äúwasted‚Äù interviews from earlier weren‚Äôt really wasted; they set me up to do better this time.\n3. Having \\~7 years of experience doesn‚Äôt exempt you from practicing fundamentals. But it *does* give you more stories and perspective for behavioral/design rounds.\n\nCurious: has anyone else noticed interviews feeling slightly more reasonable lately? Or was this just lucky timing?\n\n**New Sankey diagrams:**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/hO9VgFg](https://imgur.com/a/hO9VgFg) \\- Without any failure reason categorization  \n[https://imgur.com/a/9BTI7q2](https://imgur.com/a/9BTI7q2) \\- With weighted failure reason categorization",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI‚Äôm finishing up a PhD in CS at a top U.S. school (think Stanford, MIT, CMU, or Berkeley). I recently received an industry offer that isn‚Äôt research-oriented (no publications involved), and I‚Äôm torn between taking it and graduating soon or going on the academic job market.\n\nFor context, I have 10+ first-author papers at top AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) with around 400 citations in total. My advisor says I‚Äôm one of the best students they‚Äôve had in the past decade and that I should be able to land a tenure-track position at a top institution.\n\nIn terms of compensation, I can expect around $400‚Äì500K total in industry (with a $300K base). Assistant professors in my field at top schools seem to start around $160‚Äì180K including summer support and benefits. Tenured associate professors make roughly $220K+, full professors around $280K+, and side consulting can add a meaningful amount on top of that.\n\nHere‚Äôs my dilemma: I‚Äôm completely burned out from the publish-or-perish sprint. It feels impossible to truly rest from research, it follows you even into your dreams. I also sometimes feel empty producing papers that don‚Äôt seem to have much real-world relevance. Maybe things would get better once I settle into a tenure-track position with more autonomy, but I‚Äôm not sure. I don‚Äôt hate research, but the passion I once had for it is gone. These days, it feels more like a job I need to perform well in general at rather than something I‚Äôm genuinely excited about.\n\nThat said, I absolutely love the flexibility and freedom academia offers. Being able to set my own schedule, take time off when needed, and choose topics that genuinely interest me has been invaluable. You also get summers (mostly) off from teaching and service, plus sabbaticals down the line. Most importantly, I find mentoring and teaching students incredibly meaningful in a way that publishing papers never has been. That‚Äôs the kind of ‚Äúimpact‚Äù that actually feels real to me.\n\nSo‚Ä¶ how do you decide between academia and industry when the pros and cons barely overlap? And is it reasonable to pursue an academic career if you don‚Äôt love research anymore, but deeply enjoy teaching and mentoring?\n\nI know no one can make this decision for me, but I‚Äôm feeling pretty lost right now and would really appreciate any perspectives or advice.\n\nThanks a lot for reading.",

Here's some considerations:\n\n- My job right now is stable, at a well established company with little chances of being let go, but no room for salary or career growth.\n\n- The new job is performance based, and a new subsidiary of a bigger company so a bigger risk\n\n- The new job requires a skill set I'm a bit out of practice with so it will likely require a lot of hard work to get skilled up \n\n- The parent company is well funded and well established \n\n- New job is paying double what I'm making now with more potential for growth \n\n- I don't have kids, my expenses are reasonable, and I have savings and experience as a fallback\n\nPlease let me know what you all think, thank you!",

        "content": "I recently got a job offer this week that I honestly never thought I‚Äôd get. It‚Äôs a SWE role at a pretty well-known Web3 company with a more than 30% total comp increase (about 265k vs my current 200k) and it's fully remote. The only catch is it's likely going to be intense with tight sprints, and fast-paced. I heard that they have a culture where people typically stay 1‚Äì2 years before moving on. But it's definitely a good place to make money.\n\nMy **c**urrent job has pretty good job security at a company that works for the G. If I were to be honest to myself, I only do about 5 hours of real work per day. I go to the office twice a week for 30 mins each way. There are downsides (occasional confusion from unstructured sprints, tedious work, little growth), but overall it‚Äôs comfortable. But if I leave this job, it's quite difficult to return if I ever regret.\n\nThe thing is I‚Äôve always had this itch and dream of building my own product or small business someday. My logic was that this comfortable job would give me the time and space to pursue that dream. But in realityI haven‚Äôt much, just a tiny bit. I‚Äôve been spending my extra time moving places, doing hobbies, or just unwinding.\n\nIt makes me question if I can even trust myself to use free time productively for a side business. I don‚Äôt even have a concrete idea yet, just vague thoughts about building a micro-SaaS, but the market‚Äôs competitive and I‚Äôm not sure what problem to tackle.\n\nSo now I‚Äôm torn because if I stay, I get comfort, stability, low stress but I risk stagnation and feel stupid leaving a lot of money on the table. And if I leave, I get more money, growth, and momentum but likely lose my free time and might burn out kept thinking of not scratching my itch.\n\nI‚Äôm nearing 40 already, so I also think about whether I should be prioritising stability or taking one last big career leap while I still can while I'm starting a family at the same time.\n\nHow should I even decide especially for the long term?",

The second reason I'm asking is because a lot of the IT jobs are on site or hybrid and since I live in a small town, I have to drive an hour both ways everyday, which is exhausting. And of course the pay is higher in software engineering than it is in IT.\n\n  \nOne last thing, since I have experience in IT and do security (pentesting) training on my own as a hobby (CTF's), I could get the cybersecurity degree in about 7 to 8 months.

Financially I have roughly \\~100k in cash and another 100k in the stock market. Monthly rent is 2.5k \n\n2. I'm initially planning to put my two weeks in mid January prior to my planned Japan Ski trip in February\n\n  \nTiming is key here as I do need to stay for the rest of the year to qualify for bonus + 401k contribution for the fiscal year. Question to you guys is would you go with the initial plan of putting in the two weeks in mid January or continue to quiet quit until ski season is over?

But coming from a family where my parents were immigrants and struggling to feed two kids, I do have some PTDSD with money and it makes me a little worried. \n\nI know some individuals will point out that it's not ideal to do this in this economy, but I also know that I'm in a point of my career where if I don't take some time off now, I will never have the opportunity to do so as I currently don't have any kids. For context, I am an EM right now and will be looking for EM roles after taking time off. \n\n  \nLet me know what you guys think. Any suggestions is greatly appreciated!",

Because my previous roles had me at the intersection of business and technology, my goal (known by my management team) is to eventually transition to the \"business side\" of our team/very well known company.¬†\n\nI know that ideally I need to get credentials other¬†than an associates degree, given today's market. I‚Äôve been pricing out a CS Bachelor's degree and the time it would take to finish... I‚Äôm looking at like 3.5 years and $65k. That‚Äôs a lot. While I was doing this, I ended up coming across an opportunity to complete a Master‚Äôs Degree in CS (it is a performance based admissions which accepts applicants w/o a bachelor‚Äôs) at a reputable, accredited school¬† (CU Boulder Online) for 1/2 the time and a fraction of the cost.\n\nI know that given my current career trajectory, having that Master's would be really helpful to me. I also have credits in business that are¬†transferrable, and found out that I could get an online BS in business from WGU in a relatively short amount of time (less than one year).¬†\n\nWould having a Master's degree in CS without a CS bachelor (instead bachelor would be in business) be a detriment to me in applying/changing jobs/getting my resume through an ATS system in the future for tech and related roles that I cannot think of at the moment?\n\nI¬†am just afraid that not having the CS Bachelor would be a deterrent. I am over 30 and being able to do these degrees online and specifically have the technology degree being \"higher level\" to match my skill set, would make it a lot easier to get through.¬† I figured this is an OK strategy, but I don‚Äôt want to shoot myself in the foot‚Ä¶maybe someone can see a risk that I can't.\n\nThank you!\n\nP.S. - Edited to add: ¬†My friend who is a manager said that the Master's would be good for leveling up in our system, but that it could potentially exclude me from job reqs that require a BS in CS... so that is what has me nervous about going down this path. However, I have been seeing more job posts in our system for 'Bachelor's Degree'  and it doesn't say any specific disipline, whereas before many of our postings would say Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or Higher/Equivalent Experince. Our company  is also  very open to people with 'different' backgrounds as long as they can 'prove' they have the skills to do the work. With this in mind, do you think purely getting the Master's is a determent (and BS in CS is better) or is it a worthwhile path to pursue to get the MS as I have already planned? Thank you!",

I keep on hearing how tough the job market is right now and people sending out hundreds of resumes with no response. I also hear from recruiters that they get inundated with hundreds of applications per opening. It's easy to get discouraged hearing this but there might be nuisances to this. Perhaps the low response rates are due to lack of qualifications on the candidate's part (ie, newly grads applying for experienced roles), or maybe the market is tough for entry-level jobs but not as bad for experienced roles. Either way, I'm curious to see if anyone has actually gotten offers recently (and if you may, tell us as much as you are comfortable about the role and your background). That way we can get some real perspective.\n\nThanks",

        "content": "I remember when I was a junior/mid level engineer, I found the technical part to be very challenging and I figured that's why people high up were paid a lot, they spent the \\~8 or so years learning so were better at programming. As I leveled up, I noticed that I didn't really have any more technical challenges to solve in my domain. Everything was pretty straight forward and easy to implement. Tell me what you wanna see, and I can make it happen\n\nBut I've been in senior roles for a while and it doesn't really feel like I *ever* use my technical abilities anymore. Often, I feel actively held back from doing so. Like I could easily fix a bug, but there's often tons of overhead and planning that make it not really worth doing. I spend most of my time fighting with people over things that really don't matter, trying to decode a bunch of corporate jargon, and trying to navigate navigate corporate politics\n\nI feel like I've never doubted my ability to deliver on anything that anyone wants in my domain (frontend), it's usually just an oddly bureaucratic set of hoops to jump through to get even the most basic things done. 90% of time is just spent communicating to higher ups, and only a minuscule fraction of time is available for coding. I kind of understand now why people study for leetcode, at this level, it feels like there's nothing to actually code anymore\n\nI was let go and decided to work a bit on a personal project cause I was bored. I was working on a component library before I was let go and had some ideas I wanted to try. So, I spun up my own and within literally 4 hours, I had most of the library done. At work, it took 2 months to get *one component* shipped. I also for once enjoyed making something and felt really proud of the result. Just seemed so different than work\n\nAnd FYI the last place I worked that was the *most* corporate was a small startup that seemed to fancy themselves a \"developer first\" company and tried to minimize on management\n\nIs this a common experience? Like is this just what it is at the more senior level?",

        "content": "I went to a T10 university for undergrad and did applied math & economics, wanted to work in tech but graduated into a horrible market so decided to do a masters in CS (ML focused) afterwards at the same university, then graduated into an even worse market. Spent months looking for a job and eventually landed a job in model risk at the associate level at a T1 bank in NYC focused on AI/ML models. This *felt* tech-adjacent enough that, as someone who had been searching for a job for a long time, I felt like I was obligated to take it. So I did.\n\nThe role is ok. Definitely boring, only a bit of coding but alot of looking at code. It's close enough to the models themselves that I feel like I'm maintaining my technical chops. But I'm realizing that being at a bank is just not for me and I want to do something closer to the action. I've only been here for a few months but I fully intend to try and leave model risk after a year or two at this job.\n\nNot gonna lie, I've been kind of spiraling a bit lately since I've been scared that I've already boxed myself into a risk/compliance archetype that'll make it impossible to pivot to anything more exciting. Part of this is just the fact that model risk is an area thats kind of unique to banks and thus less transferable, but my cope is that since I'm working with AI/ML models more than financial models, that makes me marginally more \"tech-adjacent\" if you will. Ideally I would land a role in as a PM or TPM in AI/Responsible AI, as those *feel* like more natural pivots than trying to immediately start coding full-time again, but I worry about how my background will be perceived.\n\nThis is my first full time role. Maybe I'm just overestimating how rigid career trajectories and exit opportunities and those things are. I just don't wanna be stuck doing this for the rest of my life. Yeah it pays pretty well but it's not fulfilling or exciting. Any advice or thoughts would be much appreciated on how I should try to approach the next year or so to angle myself best",

I switched into this field because I wanted a career that rewarded expertise. \n\nIt seems like while there is a bar of knowledge required to *get a job*, deep knowledge, expertise, quality, etc aren't respected that much.\n\nWhy? I'm looking for new jobs now, and most recruiters have no idea what they're looking for. You could be the world's greatest distributed systems expert and no recruiter would have any idea. They're basically just keyword matching on resumes.\n\nBut at the job? My boss doesn't know what I do. In fact, I have to update him with details on what I've done to justify the time that I spend on projects. He probably understands around 10% of the actual work that I do. \n\nUpper management sees engineers as mostly fungible cogs to be replaced by cheaper humans and/ or tech (see the offshoring and AI push happening currently), while patting themselves on the back for their management decisions which are much less complex than the actual work being done at the ground level.\n\nYeah, I know that Senior/Staff/Principal, etc roles exist. But even then, they're just bigger, more valuable cogs in the machine. The highest-paid, most-respected members of any company with the most freedom are going to be in upper levels of management.\n\nIt seems like \"expertise\" in this field comes down more to marketing/ selling your impact than actually being good at the work. Simply being excellent at the work will lock you into a mid/ senior-level SWE role at best.\n\nSo effectively, I work for people who don't know what I do, interview for companies that don't know what they want, and how good that I *actually* am doesn't seem to matter much at all.

Things are especially bad because all the entry level positions get flooded by people with experience who are obviously better than me in every way? There's also no more spring 2025 positions pretty much, like all those new grad positions don't even have an option to say I've graduated in spring 2025 outside of the \"other\" option which means my application would probably get thrown out instantly.\n\nExperience wise I am in a bad spot, I don't have very much \"real\" internship experience, the past 4 summers in college I was at a small 1 guy + random interns place where I did random hardware ish projects with PLCs. Some years I had projects where I made a mini server and made some pages with PHP and Javascript, another year I made a small app for Zoom meetings on a headset, but none of that really counts as real stuff because I don't have any real metrics for them (because I don't have any relationship with the companies my boss was making stuff for, I can't just ask them to give me months of random data for me to see exactly how much money the thing I did made?).  My parents put my old resume in ChatGPT and got something that just looks so much worse to me? It ended up making those 4 summers into one thing which to me just looks like a complete lie. Background check would immediately see that I only did like 12 months instead of 4 consecutive years or even without a background check they would think I am completely lying because I can't work a full time in person internship in one city and go to college full time in person 100 miles away, that is not believable. Should I just put that lie there anyway???\n\nBut that's all in the past now, I have to do something to make myself more hireable now before my qualifications drop to zero, but I just don't know what. I can't really do networking because there's basically nothing in the way of local software openings. Befriending some random in some company isn't really going to help me unless they are someone really high up, but I just don't have that kind of charisma to make myself the best friend of some hiring person to the point that I will get in instead of all the much higher qualified people out there.\n\nProject wise I am in a bad spot too. Some college classes gave me some stuff to put on there, one class had a group project where our group made a web app with React and Firebase but that doesn't really mean much as it wasn't a \"real\" project with big profit numbers and impressive metrics of any kind. I also spent a year in high school making a old game mod with assembly but that doesn't really count because assembly code is not something anyone is hiring at entry level. It has a playerbase that I estimated to be roughly 5000+ but that doesn't really count for anything because it's not a dollar value.\n\nI just can't think of a good project to do that has anything \"impressive\" or would lead to massively impressive metrics? The only real metrics they care about are dollar values? Because anything other than those aren't really \"impressive\" (it doesn't matter if you've written X lines of code or worked with a database of X size or had X users or used X different programming languages or technologies because they don't really care about that). I don't know how to turn a profit as a guy who isn't an entrepreneur, marketer or good artist. Everything out there bangs on about those stupid metrics and it just frustrates me to no end. Because I don't know how to make anything impressive at all. I can't really think of something that distinguishes \"stupid toy project\" vs \"something hiring people are impressed by\" outside of something profitable or something made specifically for that company (which is just infeasible for me to do, I can't spend months on a massive project just to apply to a single company and have those hiring people not even bother looking).\n\nI also don't really have good answers to all the STAR questions they ask? Because I never have a result that's better than \"it got done\" or something similar. Like I keep repeating in this post I don't have metrics and I don't know how to make a project that makes those metrics happen. I also don't have good answers for their other kind of questions like \"explain a time where you had a conflict with a coworker\" because I don't have experience like that (the worst that happened to the groups I was in was more like \"minor disagreement that gets resolved in 1 minute\", I just don't have a compelling story about how all the group members were arguing for hours and then I stopped it in 1 second.). I also never have a good answer for \"why do you want to work for this company\" because I don't really care about random company #1000 I've applied to, I just can't give them the answer \"I have always strived to work for this specific company and I have never applied to anything else and I will die for this company that I've only heard of when I saw the job posting\"",

Anyways I have been applying since summer and no one ever responded. I have sent lots of jobs and non responded. Not many jobs left that I can apply to at this point so I started applying to IT support as well and got an interview lined up and to my superise I am not sure I want this job anymore. I also during the application lied about being good/ fluent at a few things I barely know so prolly won't get it anyways. Not only that but I have decided to go back to school in January if not earlier because everything looks hopeless. All in all I feel like going there and being completely honest even if it means I won't get it and I won't accept low salary either. Any input or advice?",

Everything is pretty good (work-life balance, team culture, etc.). The work is interesting and I'm optimistic and at least semi-interested in the product. I've gone from entry level to senior on this team, and can still have  career progression here.\n\nHowever, I feel my technical skills have been stagnating. There isn't much engineering mentorship, so I haven't been learning better engineers. If I got laid off today, I don't think future jobs would think my skills match my resume/level. Additionally, my role is very specialized, so I'm being pigeonholed in where I can work, since despite being senior, I lack a breadth of experience.\n\nDilemma: I was offered an internal transfer role to a team doing something completely different, and has many higher level engineers to learn from. However, there are lots of unknowns. The product itself seems much less interesting, and of course there is no telling how the people are to work with or the team culture.\n\nWhat would you do in this situation? Stay where you're at, happy currently, but letting my growth stagnate and potentially limiting my options in the future, or take a leap of faith in order to gain experience?\n\nThanks in advance!",
