To be honest regardless of the the fivetran acquisition, dbt-core never got any improvement over time. And it always neglected community contributions. \n\n[OpenDBT](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt) fork is created to solve this problem. Enabling community to extend dbt to their own needs and evolve opensource version and make it feature rich.\n\n[OpenDBT](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt) dynamically extends dbt-core. It's already adding significant features that aren't in the dbt-core. This is a path toward a complete community-driven fork.\n\nWe are inviting developers and the wider data community to collaborate. \n\nPlease check out the features we've already added, star the repo, and feel free to submit a PR! \n\n[https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt)",

What annoys me are not the posts themselves, but the culture and the companies making believe that all this is necessary. So i feel like people need to manage their expectations. In themselves and  in the companies they work for. The following are OPINIONS of mine that help me to check in with myself.\n\n1. You are not the company and the company is not you. If they want you to use a new tool, they need to provide PAID time for you to learn the tool.\n\n2. Don't do personal projects (unless you REALLY enjoy it). It just takes time you could have spend doing literally anything else. Personal projects will not prepare you for the real thing because the data isn't as messy,  the business is not as annoying and you want have to deal with coworkers breaking production pipelines. \n\n3. Nobody cares about certifications. If I have to do a certification, I want to be paid for it and not pay for it.\n\n4. Life over work. Always.\n\n5. Don't beat yourself up, if you don't know something. It's fine. Try it out and fail. Try again. (During work hours of course)\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, i read stuff in my offtime as well and i am in this reddit. But i only as long I enjoy it.

I deployed a local Git server, maintain and own the DB instance that hosts our DWH, re-implemented and redesigned Python dashboards because the old implementation was slow and useless, deployed some infrastructure for data engineering workloads, developed cli frameworks to cut-off manual work and code redundancy, and harmonized inconsistent sources to produce accurate insights (they used to just dump Excel files and DB tables into SSIS, which generated wrong numbers) all locally.\n\nLast Thursday, we got a request with a deadline on Sunday, even though Friday and Saturday are our weekend (I’m in Egypt, and my team is currently working from home to deliver it, for free).\n\nAt first, I didn’t mind because I wanted to deliver and learn, but now I’m getting frustrated. I barely have time to rest, let alone learn new things that could actually help me grow (technically or financially).\n\nUnpaid overtime is normalized here, and changing companies locally won’t fix that. So I’ve started thinking about moving to Europe, but I’m not sure I’m ready for such a competitive market since everything we do is on-prem and I’ve never touched cloud platforms.\n\nAnother issue: I feel like the only technical person in the office. When I talk about software design, abstraction, or maintainability, nobody really gets it. They just think I’m “going fancy,” which leaves me on-call. \n\nOne time, I recommended loading all our sources into a 3rd normal form schema as a single source of truth, because the same piece of information was scattered across multiple systems and needed tracking, enforcement, and auditing before hitting our Kimball DWH. They looked at me like I was a nerd trying to create extra work.\n\nI’m honestly feeling trapped.\nShould I keep grinding, or start planning my exit to a better environment (like Europe or remote)?\nAny advice from people who’ve been through this?\n",

I always wanted to work in a data engineering project and recently i got an opportunity to work on a project which seem to be exciting with GenAI & Python stuff. My role here is to develop python scripts to integrate multiple sources and LLM outputs and package everything into a solution. I designed a config driven ETL code using python and wrote multiple classes to package everything into a single codebase. I used LLM chats to optimise my code. Due to very tight deadlines I had to rush the development without realising the whole thing would turn into a nightmare. I have tried my best to follow the coding standards but the client is very upset about few parts of the design. A couple of days ago, I had a code review meeting with my client team where I had to walk through my code and answer questions inorder to get the approval for QA. The client team had an architect level manager who had already gone through the repository and had a lot of valid questions about the design flaws in the code. I felt very embarrassed during the meeting and it was a very awkward conversation. Everytime he had pointed out something wrong, I had no answers to it and there was silence for about half a minute before I say \" Ok I can implement that\". I know it is my fault that I didn't have enough knowledge about designing data systems but I'm worried more about tarnishing my companies' reputation by providing a low quality deliverable. I just wanted to rant about how disappointed I feel about myself. Have you ever been in a situation like this?",

Superset seems to also have at least some kind of support for Ducklake, so I wanted to try that as well.\n\nSo I set up an EC2 where I pull a git repo and then spin up few docker compose services. First service is postgres that acts as a metadata for both Superset and Ducklake. Then Superset service spins up nginx and gunicorn that run the BI layer.\n\nActual ETL can be done anywhere on the EC2 (or Lambdas if you will) but basically I'm just pulling data from open source API's, doing a bit of transformation and then pushing the data to Ducklake. Storage is S3 and Ducklake handles the parquet files there.\n\nSuperset has access to the Ducklake metadata DB and therefore is able to access the data on S3.\n\nTo my surprise, this is working quite nicely. The only issue seems to be how Superset displays the schema of the Ducklake, as it shows all the secrets of the connection URI (:\n\nI don't want to publish the git repo as it's not very polished, but I just wanted to maybe raise discussion if anyone else has tried something similar before?\nThis sure was refreshing and different than my day to day job with big data.\n\nAnd if anyone has any questions regarding setting this up, I'm more than happy to help!",

Their current data estate is quite outdated (e.g. single step function manually triggered, 40+ state machines running lambda scripts to manipulate data. Also they’re on Redshit and connect to Qlik for BI. I don’t think they’re willing to change those two), and as I just recently joined, they’re asking me to modernise it. The modern data stack mentioned above is what I believe would work best and also what I’m most comfortable with. \n\nNow the question is, as DBT has been acquired by Fivetran a few weeks ago, how would you tackle the migration to a completely new modern data stack? Would DBT still be your choice even if not as “open” as it was before and the uncertainty around maintenance of dbt-core? Or would you go with something else? I’m not aware of any other tool like DBT that does such a good job in transformation.\n\nAm I unnecessarily worrying and should I still go with proposing DBT? Sorry if a similar question has been asked already but couldn’t find anything on here.\n\nThanks!",

From there so far so good.\n\nIn dbt, our source points only to the latest file.\nThen we have an incremental model that:\nApply business logic , detected updated columns, build history columns (valid from valid to etc)\n\nMy issue: our history is only inside an incremental model , we can’t do full refresh.

If we ever do, we can just restore the db backup \n3. You will increase dramatically the storage on the db \n4. If we lose the lake or the db, it’s the same thing anyway \n5. We already have the data lake to need everything \n\nHow can I frame my argument to the business ? \n\nIt’s a huge company with tons of business people watching the project burocracy etc.\n\nEDIT: my idea to create another table will be have a “bronze layer” raw layer whatever you want to call it to store all the parquet data, at is a snapshot , add a date column.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "As part of a wider move towards data products as well as building better controls into our pipelines, we’re looking at how we can implement data contracts as code. I’ve done a number of proof of concepts across various options and currently the Open Data Contract Specification alongside datacontract-cli is looking good. However, while I see how it can work well with “frozen” contracts, I start getting lost on how to allow schema evolution. \n\nOur typical scenarios for Python-based data ingestion pipelines are all batch-based, consisting of files being pushed to us or our pulling from database tables. Our ingestion pattern is to take the producer dataset, write it to parquet for performant operations, and then validate it with schema and quality checks. The write to parquet (with PyArrow’s ParquetWriter) should include the contract schema to enforce the agreed or known datatypes. \n\nHowever, with dynamic schema evolution, you ideally need to capture the schema of the dataset to be able to compare it to your current contract state to alert for breaking changes etc. Contract-first formats like ODCS take a bit of work to define, plus you may have zero-padded numbers defined as varchar in the source data you want to preserve, so inferring that schema for comparison becomes challenging. \n\nI’ve gone down quite a rabbit hole now and am likely overcooking it, but my current thinking is to write all dataset fields to parquet as string, validate the data formats are as expected, and then subsequent pipeline steps can be more flexible with inferred schemas. I think I can even see a way to integrate this with dlt. \n\nHow do others approach this?",

Each split maximizes:\n\n\n\nGain = GradientGain + λ·InformationGain\n\n\n\nwhere λ adapts based on class imbalance. This explicitly optimizes for information gain on the minority class instead of just minimizing loss.\n\nCombined with:\n\n\\- Quantile-based binning (robust to scale shifts)\n\n\\- Conservative regularization (prevents overfitting to majority)\n\n\\- PR-AUC early stopping (focuses on minority performance)\n\nThe architecture is inherently more robust to drift without needing online adaptation.\n\n Trade-offs\n\nThe good:\n\n\\- Auto-tunes for your data (no hyperparameter search needed)\n\n\\- Works out-of-the-box on extreme imbalance\n\n\\- Comparable inference speed to XGBoost\n\nThe honest:\n\n\\- \\~2-4x slower training (45s vs 12s on 170K samples)\n\n\\- Slightly behind on balanced data (use XGBoost there)\n\n\\- Built in Rust, so less Python ecosystem integration\n\n Why I'm Sharing\n\nThis started as a learning project (built from scratch in Rust), but the drift resilience results surprised me. I haven't seen many papers addressing this - most focus on online learning or explicit drift detection.\n\nLooking for feedback on:\n\n\\- Have others seen similar robustness from conservative regularization?\n\n\\- Are there existing techniques that achieve this without retraining?\n\n\\- Would this be useful for production systems, or is 2-4x slower training a dealbreaker?\n\n\n\n Links\n\n\\- GitHub: [https://github.com/Pushp-Kharat1/pkboost](https://github.com/Pushp-Kharat1/pkboost)\n\n\\- Benchmarks include: Credit Card Fraud, Pima Diabetes, Breast Cancer, Ionosphere\n\n\\- MIT licensed, \\~4000 lines of Rust\n\nHappy to answer questions about the implementation or share more detailed results.

        "content": "Background: the enterprise DE in my org manages the big data environment.  He uses nifi for orchestration and snowflake for the data warehouse. As far as how his environment is actually put together and communicating all I know is that he uses zookeeper for his nifi cluster and it’s on the cloud (Azure). There is no one who knows anything more than that. No one in IT. Not his boss. Not his one employee. No one knows and his reason is that he doesn’t trust anyone and they aren’t good enough, not even his employee.\n\n\nThe discussion. Have you dealt with such a person? How has your org dealt with people gatekeeping like this? \n\nFrom my perspective this is a massive problem and basically means that this guy is a massive walking pile of technical debt. If he leaves then the clean up and troubleshooting to figure out what he did would be immense.  On top of that he now has suggested taking over smaller DE processes from other outside IT as a play to “centralize” data engineering work. He won’t let them migrate their stuff to his environment as again he doesn’t rust them to be good enough and doesn’t want to teach them how to use his environment. So he is just safe guarding his job really and taking away others jobs in my opinion.  I also recently got some people in IT to approve me setting up Airflow outside of IT and to do data engineering (which I was already doing but just with cron). He has thrown some shots at me but I ignored him because I’m trying to set something up for other people to use to and document it so that it can be maintained should I leave.\n\nTLDR have you dealt with people gatekeeping knowledge and what happened to them?",

Therefore, I want to download the files and store them temporarily, upload them to Google Drive and then remove them.\n\nFirst, I tried to download them to a lakehouse, but I then understood that removing files in Lakehouse is only a soft-delete and that it still stores it for 7 days, and I want to avoid being billed for all those GBs...\n\nSo, to my question. ChatGPT proposed that I download the files into a folder like \"/tmp/\\*filename.csv\\*\", and supposedly when I do that I use the ephemeral memory created when running the notebook, and then the files will be automatically removed when the notebook is finished running.\n\nThe solution works and I cannot see the files in my lakehouse, so from my point of view the solution works. BUT, I cannot find any documentation of using this method, so I am curious as to how this really works? Have any of you used this method before? Are the files really deleted after the notebook finishes? Is there any better way of doing this? \n\n  \nThankful for any answers!\n\n ",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a beginner data engineer (~1 yoe in DE), we have built a python ingestion framework that does the following:\n\n1. Fetches data in chunks from RDS table\n2. Loads dataframes to Snowflake tables using put stream to SF stage and COPY INTO.\n\nConfig for each source table in RDS, target table in Snowflake, filters to apply etc are maintained in a snowflake table which is fetched before each Ingestion Job.\nThese ingestion jobs need to run on a schedule, therefore we created cronjobs on an on-prem VM (yes, 1 VM) that triggers the python ingestion script (daily, weekly, monthly for different source tables).\nWe are moving to EKS by containerizing the ingestion code and using Kubernetes Cronjobs to achieve the same behaviour as earlier (cronjobs in VM). There are other options like Glue, Spark etc but client wants EKS, so we went with it. Our team is also pretty new, so we lack experience to say \"Hey, instead of EKS, use this\". \nThe ingestion module is just a bunch of python scripts with some classes and functions. How much can performance be improved if I follow a worker pattern where workers pull from a job queue (AWS SQS?) and do just plain extract and load from rds to snowflake. The workers can be deployed as a kubernetes deployment with scalable replicas of workers. A master pod/deployment can handle orchestration of job queue (adding, removing, tracking ingestion jobs).\nI beleive this approach can scale well compared to Cronjobs approach where each pod that handles ingestion job can only have access to finite resources enforced by resources.limits.cpu and mem.\n\nPlease give me your suggestions regarding the current approach and new design idea. Feel free to ridicule, mock, destroy my ideas. As a beginner DE i want to learn best practices when it comes to data ingestion particularly at scale. At what point do i decide to switch from existing to a better pattern?\n\nThanks in advance!!!",

It’s basically a modernized spin on the kind of work I do at my job, a Transaction Data Platform with a multi-step ETL pipeline.\n\nQuick overview of setup:\n\nDB structure:\n\nDimensions = Bank -> Account -> Routing\n\nFact = Transactions -> Transaction\\_Steps\n\nHistory = Hist_Transactions -> Hist_Transaction_Steps (identical to fact tables, just one extra column) \n\nI mocked up 3 regions -> 3 banks per region -> 3 accounts per bank -> 702 unique directional routings.\n\nA Python script first assigns following parameters to each routing:\n\ntype (High Intensity/Frequency/Normal)\n\ncountry\\_code, region, cross\\_border\n\nbase\\_freq, base\\_amount, base\\_latency, base\\_success\n\nvolatility vars (freq/amount/latency/success)\n\nThen the synthesizer script uses above paramters to spit out 85k-135k records per day, and 5x times Transaction\\_Steps \n\nAnomaly engine randomly spikes volatility (50–250x) \\~5 times a week for a random routing, the aim is (hopefully) the pipeline will detect the anomalies.\n\nPipeline workflow:\n\nBatch runs daily (simulating off business hours migration).\n\nEvery day data older than 1 month in live table is moved to history tables (partitioned by day and OLTP compressed) \n\nThen the partitions older than a month in history tables are exported to Parquet (maybe I'll create a Data lake or something) cold storage and stored. \n\nThe current day's transactions are transformed through DBT, to generate 12 marts, helping in anomaly detection and system monitoring \n\nA Great Expectation + Python layer takes care of data quality and Anomaly detection\n\nFinally for visualization and ease of discussion I'm generating a streamlit dashboard from above 12 marts.\n\nMain concerns/questions:\n\n1. Since this is just inspired by my current work (I didn’t use real table names/logic, just the concept), should I be worried about IP/overlap ?\n2. I’ve done a barebones version of this in shell+SQL, so I personally know business and technical requirements and possible issues in this project, it feels really straightforward.  Do you think this is a solid enough project to showcase for DE roles at product-based-companies / fintechs (0–3 YOE range)?\n3. Thoughts on using synthetic data? I’ve tried to make it noisy and realistic, but since I’ll always have control, I feel like I'm missing something critical that only shows up in real-world messy data?\n\nWould love any outside perspective\n\nThis would ideally be the portfolio project, and there's one more planned using spark where I'm just cleaning and merging Spotify datasets from different types (CSV, json, sqlite, parquet etc) from Kaggle, it's just a practice project to showcase spark understanding. \n\n**TLDR:**  \nBuilt a synthetic transaction pipeline (750k+ txns, 3.75M steps, anomaly injection, DBT marts, cold storage). Looking for feedback on:\n\n* IP concerns (inspired by work but no copied code/keywords)\n* Whether it’s a strong enough DE project for Product Based Companies and Fintech. \n* Pros/cons of using synthetic vs real-world messy data",

        "author": "fabkosta",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Recently I have been contemplating the idea of a \"data ontology\" on top of Apache Iceberg. The idea is that within a domain you can change data schema in any way you intend using default Apache Iceberg functionality. However, when you publish a data product such that it can be consumed by other data domains then the schema of your data product is frozen, and there is some technical enforcement of the data schema such that the upstream provider domain cannot simply break the schema of the data product thus causing trouble for the downstream consumer domain. Whenever a schema change of the data product is required then the upstream provider domain must go through an official change request with version control etc. that must be accepted by the downstream consumer domain.\n\nObviously, building the full product would be highly complicated with all the bells and whistles attached. But building a small PoC to showcase could be achievable in a realistic timeframe.\n\nNow, I have been wondering:\n\n1. What do you generally think of such an idea? Am I onto something here? Would there be demand for this? Would Apache Iceberg be the right tech for that?\n\n2. I could not find this idea implemented anywhere. There are things that come close (like Starburst's data catalogue) but nothing that seems to actually technically enforce schema change for data products. From what I've seen most products seem to either operate at a lower level (e.g. table level or file level), or they seem to not actually enforce data product schemas but just describe their schemas.

        "content": "At work (30-person B2B SaaS), we’re currently debating evolving our data schema. The founders cobbled something together 10 years ago on AWS and through some patching and upgrading, we’ve scaled to 10,000 users, typically sales reps.\n\nOne challenge we’ve long faced is data analysis. We take raw JSON records from CRMs/VOIPs/etc, filter them using conditions, and turn them into performance records on another table. These “promoted” JSON records are then pushed to RedShift where we can do some deeper analysis (such as connecting companies and contacts together, or tying certain activities back to deals, and then helping clients to answer more complex questions than “how many meetings have my team booked this week?”). Without going much deeper, going from performance records back to JSON records and connecting them to associated records but only those that have associated performance… Yeah, it’s not great. \n\nThe evolved data schema we’re considering is a star schema making use of our own model that can transform records from various systems into this model’s common format. So “company” records from Salesforce, HubSpot, and half a dozen all CRMs are all represented relatively similarly (maybe a few JSON properties we’d keep in a JSON column for display only). \n\nCurrent tables we’re sat on are dimensions for very common things like users, companies, and contacts. Facts are for activities (calls, emails, meetings, tasks, notes etc) and deals.\n\nMy worry is that any case of a star schema being used that I’ve come across has been for internal analytics - very rarely a multi-tenant architecture for customer data. We’re prototyping with Tinybird which sits on top of Clickhouse. There’s a lot of stuff for us to consider around data deletion, custom properties per integration and so on, but that’s for another day. \n\nDoes this overall approach sit ok with you? Anything feel off or set off alarm bells? \n\nAppreciate any thoughts or comments!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Some fact tables are fairly straightforward, others can be very complicated. I'm working on a extremely complicated composite metric fact table, the output metric is computed queries/combinations/logic from \\~15 different business process fact tables. From a quality standpoint I am very concerned about transparency and explainability of this final metric. So, in addition to the metric value, I'm also considering writing to the fact the values which were used to create the desired metric, with their vintage and other characteristics. So, for example if the metric M=A+B+C-D-E+F-G+H-I; then I would not only store each value, but also the point in time it was pulled from source \\[some of these values are very volatile and are essentially sub queries with logic/filters\\]. For example: A\\_Value = xx, B\\_Value = yyy, C\\_value = zzzz, A\\_TimeStamp = 10/24/25 3:56AM, B\\_Timestamp = 10/24/25 1:11AM, C\\_Timestamp = 10/24/25 6:47AM.\n\nYou can see here that M was created using data from very different points of time, and in this case the data can change a lot within a few hours. \\[data is not only being changed by a 24x7 global business, but also by system batch processing on schedule\\] If someone else uses the same formula, but data from later points in time they might get a different result (and yes, we would ideally wish A,B,C...  to be from the same point in time). \n\n\n\nIs this a design pattern being used? Is there a better way? Is there resources I can use to learn more about this? \n\n  \n\n\nAgain, I wouldn't use this in all designs, only those of sufficient complexity to create better visibility as to \"why the value is what it is\" (when others might disagree and argue because they used the same formula with data from different points in time or filters). \n\n\\*\\* note: I'm considering techniques to ensure all formula components are from the same \"time\" (aka: using time travel in Snowflake, or similar techniques) - but for this question, I'm only concerned about the data modeling to capture/record artifacts used for data quality / explainability.

        "author": "DataByte7389",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Background: I’m finishing up my last year in my M.S. program studying a mixture of Data Analytics and Information Systems. Before grad school, I spent a little over 4 years working remotely at a med-tech startup (around 500 people) in product management. It was a great learning experience but also very stressful. They constantly overloaded me, interfered with my school schedule (when I was working part-time in undergrad), worked late into the night constantly, and broke promises around pay and promotions.\n\nI eventually left when I started my master’s, mainly for my own sanity and so I could focus on my health, school, and my relationship. I made sure to leave on good terms since I still really like the company and the products they are creating. It’s a small, niche industry, so I wanted to keep that bridge intact.\n\nThis past summer, I interned at a manufacturing company that works in the AI/data center space. My role started as Systems Analyst but turned into more of a Data Engineering internship by the end of it. I learned a lot, but the culture was rough on my team. They didn’t really want an intern, and it was a pretty cold and dry environment with them being too busy to interact with me the whole summer. I very much had to figure out a lot of things on my own since I had to use tools and create projects I never had experience with ever. To add, this was just an issue with the team I was on, other interns had a great time on different teams. It made me consistently miss the energy and connection I had with my old coworkers at the startup, which is something I think I value a lot on a team.\n\n-Decision-\n\nThe manufacturing company gave me a full-time offer for after graduation. It is a Sr Engineer role with a total comp of 145k (Yearly Breakdown: $105k base + 10% bonus + around 30k in stock). It’s stable, the benefits are great, and they even mentioned I might rotate through different engineering areas to choose a spot I like. But most likely due to company necessity I will end up in the same team (Data Engineering) I was with before since they are spread extremely thin. I am nervous about the role since they are asking me to do projects that I have little to no experience doing with little support just like the internship. It makes me afraid (A bit of imposter syndrome?) that I will not succeed in the role since I come from a more business / analytics background. \n\nBut recently I also got contacted by my old company, who’s entering a big growth phase, and they asked if I’d consider coming back to the product team after graduation. They’ve made promises that they’ve reduced a lot of the work and the emergency late nights by creating a new team to manage them. I would focus more on actual product management and problem solving if I came back. They implied they would consider hiring me remotely again but are pushing for me to instead relocate to their HQ (based in Seattle when I am currently on the east coast). I’ve not received an offer yet as we are going back and forth still but I am familiar with the salary range based off of my co-workers. Estimated Breakdown: 80-97k Base + 10-15% Bonus + 12.5k in RSUs. \n\nPart of me wants to go back because I really loved the people and the work. But I’m scared of ending up in the same stressful situations again along with all the promises that were broken before and if they can keep them. Also scared that I won’t have much growth since they do not promote often in PM. On the other hand, the new company is stable and pays well with clear expectations but doesn’t excite me the same way as well with other fears about the position and team.\n\nHow should I proceed? Also another thing I’m thinking about is long term on which role will let me best pursue other growth opportunities and not plateau early in my career. Any advice would be appreciated even if its outside the scope of my question.\n",

Let me give some generic advice: try doing it without AI.\n\nIn the olden times, it was not uncommon for learners to have a project that did not work, and they could not figure out why. Now, thanks to AI, learners have a project that does work, and they can't figure out why.\n\nAI is not always bad or evil, but likewise, it definitely isn't always helpful. Learning requires reading, trying, making mistakes, getting confused, reading more, trying more, and repeating. \n\nStart small -- there's a reason \"hello world\" is a common first task -- the actual coding is ridiculously simple, but it proves that your have done all of the necessary work to get your environment properly running. Once you've got that working, you can move on to something more complicated.\n\nI've seen a lot of people who, with the help of AI, start with a much bigger project. AI helps them get that bigger project running, but they don't fully understand what was done to reach that point, which means they're not able to successfully make changes or fixes to that project.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with googling. There's nothing wrong with asking AI a question. But your best bet is to spend some time thinking and trying on your own before using either tool. My advice to anyone learning with AI: don't let AI read or write your code. If you're going to ask AI questions, do so in English. Use AI to help you find the terminology that you don't yet know, and once you've learned the right words, spend some time reading about what they mean. ",

It's possible to find the object constructor and every function call reference in a repository without being a command-line wiz.\n\nThe most mentally taxing code for me to read are Python libraries that heavily uses decorators to transform inputs. Some stuff in the native functools lib or data science packages seem like they could increase obfuscation in the future.\n\n```\n@np.vectorize(otypes=[float])\ndef divide(x):\n    return 6 / x\n\ndivide([1, 2, 3])\n\nOutput: array([6., 3., 2.])\n```\n\nJava. WTF. Annotations and framework parameter injections are everywhere.\n\nI was trying to help some clients debug their Java code, and it was a headache figuring where objects were being constructed and tracking functions are being called is not obvious.\n\n```\n// FileA.java\n\n@Bean\nMyServiceClient createCustomMyServiceClient(@ApiFactory MyServiceClientFactory factory) {\n  return factory.create()\n}\n\n// FileB.java\n\n@Autowired\nCallAction(MyServiceClient client) {\n  this.client = client;\n}\n\nMyServiceResponse call() {\n  return this.client.call();\n}\n```\n\nFor someone who does not write any Java, trying to debug another team's code debugging goes like this:\n\n* MyServiceClient probably has a bad configuration. I need to inspect where this object is being constructed.\n* The instance of MyServiceClient being passed to CallAction, where is it being passed?\n* I can't find a CallAction constructor call anywhere, so I don't know where MyServiceClient is coming from.\n* Maybe I can figure it by searching the codebase for all the methods that return a MyServiceClient.\n* There are multiple methods that return MyServiceClient, and none of them are called anywhere in the codebase.\n* I have no clue where this Factory is being passed either.\n* I don't know where Factory is being created. I don't know where Client is being created. And all these annotations are hiding all the details that I need as a debugger.\n\nThis is just a made up example.",

During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.\n\nEvery time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.\n\nBack in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.\n\nI’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.\n\nThe good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems. I’m practicing on LeetCode, trying to solve problems on my own, and I also started following the Coding Interview University roadmap. Right now, I’m working on a new project using this approach where ChatGPT only acts as a mentor instead of a code generator. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I finally feel like I’m actually learning something.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this after finishing school or a bootcamp? How did you transition from guided learning to being able to code independently? What helped you get through the feeling of being completely lost once the structure was gone?",

        "content": "So, I recently started programming again after like a year and a half of a break and I very vividly remember that every time I had a project idea that I thought was a bit too ambitious I would always put it away and I would think that it's too much for me and that I should do it some other time in the future. It wasn't until recently that I realized that that mindset can be really dumb sometimes and could even hinder your learning.\n\nNow, if you're an absolute beginner with weeks or barely 3 months of experience, then yeah start simple and work your way up. But, I'm talking about the beginners who already learned the fundamentals, those who already understand their programming language and can start making projects. Whatever it is you've been planning, just do it.\n\nBuilding projects will keep you in this loop of learning and crazy dopamine hits when you figure out how everything works. For example, right now I'm building an HTTP server with some help from a tutorial and it's something that I've always wanted to do but seemed so complex to me and now that I am doing it I feel so dumb for not starting it before because everything makes sense now, TCP packets are just a stream of bytes in order, almost no different to reading from a file and I've been reading files for months now. I would have never realized this if I had just said \"Nah, I'm not ready.\" \n\nPoint is, projects only seem impossible or difficult BEFORE you start them. When you do start them and you get through that first obstacle now the project just becomes something new but super fun. So, if you know you have the resources and the fundamental knowledge to start that one project that really interests you, just do it, don't put it off for another 3 months because you think you're not ready. You have endless learning resources, so start the project and build it by solving one problem at a time and you'll be fine.",

Like i get im supposed to make a jframe and add ui elements to it, but there's a disconnect happening between the coding concepts im learning and what im actually doing when building the app.\n\nAlso reading tons of documentation is very time consuming and migrane inducing. In the past ive built a very simple 3d simulation using opengl in C++ and while i did get praised a lot like i was some genuis by my proffessor, i dont even fully understand the rendering pipeline or what each and every function call i made does.\n\nBasically what im trying to say is: i fully understand the building blocks (ifs, loops, variables, functions, OOP concepts...) but i cant actually connect that to what im doing when making an app that actually does something.\n\nAlso when i have an idea for an program i wanna make, i find it really hard to break it down into managable subproblems and get overwhelmed.\n\nSo im stuck where i am right now and dont know how i should go about improving my problem solving skills at all.\n\nSorry for for how badly this post is written, i have a hard time putting the problems i have into words.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "This is what I understand. I kind of need some basic explanation to know where to look for things when I want to get deeper into this.\n\n  \nTCP and UDP are part of the **transport layer** in the tcp/ip stack and all layers up to that one are implemented by the **os kernel**. So my application won't have to implement it, it would use **system calls**.\n\nFor a web application a **client** and my **server** will communicate. The client will open a **tcp connection** with the correct **socket** ( ip : port 80 or 443 ) of my server. The client is e.g. the browser.\n\nSo now we have client and server with an open **tcp connection**.\n\n  \n**HTTP** is a protocol in the **application layer** in the tcp/ip stack so it has to be implemented by an application. In a nutshell, http is basically just a standard for how the string of text sent over the tcp connection is structured to be valid.\n\nThe **webserver** thats being communicated with is an application, so it implements the HTTP protocol. It can either serve static files or call programs or scripts and give the **request data** as a parameter. The application can then produce an answer. No matter if static or dynamic content is served, pretty much the webserver responds to the request it received\n\n\n\nSo that's my basic understanding at I think its correct. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here already.\n\nTLS is also an application layer protocol, so it has to be implemented by an application. I heard of libraries like OpenSSL implementing them.\n\nBut where do I **turn on HTTPS** now? Since the server has to be able to serve static content or forward requests to an application or a script, I'd guess in the server? But what if my application doesn't directly run on that server and the request will be forwarded, the server would send the decrypted regular HTTP for the rest of the path to my application.",

One for compiling or installing libraries, one for navigating the file system and one for the editor. When I code I often struggle with small syntactic errors all the time but have way less problems with things others consider difficult. Old things like Fortran and TCL are quite intuitive for me. I usually get good results by optimizing the underlying mathematical problem by using some tricks provided by the software or hardware. I usually write very specific solutions for a given scientific problem and optimize a lot by hand first. \n\nBut understanding concepts that aim to hide complexity is very difficult. I need to use the terminal to install software on Mac as I struggle with the basic pictures showing me to drag the .dmg from one folder to the next.

I am new to coding but i want to make a high level project to impress my teacher and be ahead of the students. Since some of them already know coding but i am willing to work super hard on this one. Making a game with graphics or something like that would be very interesting. I want something that’s unique and has not been presented to the teacher before. And i want something that showcases skills and not a copy paste. But at the same time i don’t think i would be able to apply own logics since im new. So something about which i can get information from the web or solve my problems. Pleasee,pleaseee help me cause i have to present an idea in two weeks and start working on it afterwards.",

I guess he's seen that in school, but he wants to move on to learning to actually code.\n\nOf course I'd recommend something like \"make a little game in Python\", but it occurred to me that even with help it might get frustrating and/or underwhelming.\n\nWhat I'm afraid of is that I could help him for like 2 or 3 sessions and we end up with a working version of \"Pong\" let's say.  Get the paddles moving, get the ball bouncing, etc. I'm sure it'd be fun, but I'm worried that he'd see the results, and compare it with, like, AAA game titles and just be totally disappointed. How could I organize a really successful session where he's happy with what we do? Maybe something like programming a simple NPC in an RPG game or something like that? Is there any pre-made game system with programmable \"characters\"?\n\nAnother idea I had was one of these robotics kits like Lego or Vex, they both seem to support Python in addition to Scratch, but they are quite expensive -- still it's maybe an option, maybe someone can report their experience with using it for teaching?",

        "content": "Over the last few years, I’ve been teaching myself programming. I’m currently 32 and I wouldn’t say I’m “good” at any specific language. During these past few years, I’ve always jumped between multiple languages (C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, etc). I have basic knowledge in the languages listed, but I wouldn’t say enough to build something worth while.\n\nI do try and stick to one language, but then I’d usually get bored, see a new shiny thing, and jump towards that. Then most of the time, I’ll do a complete 360 and return to the language I initially started with. I’ve been doing this for years and always struggled just to stick to 1 language. And it feels like I’ve shot myself in the foot by not specialising in a single language to become efficient in it. \n\nI think the reason why I struggle focusing on a single language, is (in my honest opinion) ADHD. I haven’t been officially diagnosed with it, but a few friends who have it, have said it’s a common thing to hyper focus on something, then jump to something else (they work in tech themselves). And the other reason, is that I do find all languages interesting and want to learn as much as possible (which I know isn’t ideal when starting out).\n\nI do believe that my interests change quite a lot too, which is most likely another factor. Whether that’ll be attempting to make a small game, website, desktop app, etc. I’ve found it hard just to pick one language and run with it, ignoring the rest until I’ve built up good knowledge of different algorithms, data structures, design patterns etc.\n\nAs an example, my current job, they use C#/.NET for the backend services, and now my brain wants to learn C# again. But then I’m telling myself, “what’s the point, as you’d only focus on it for a few weeks/months, then your focus will change when a new shiny thing is discovered, or you get bored.”\n\nHas anyone else done the same in the past? If so, how did you combat it? Any advice would be appreciated.",

Took me about a week..... He was mind-blown when I showed him the final result 🤣🤣\nJust after that, something clicked.. I actually enjoyed doing all that. So I started learning HTML and CSS on freeCodeCamp, and honestly, I’m finding it fun and kind of addictive....\n\nNow I’m wondering if I should take this seriously and maybe change careers down the road. But I need some guidance from people who’ve been there or know the field...\n\nShould I go for frontend, backend, or full stack?\n\nWhat’s the best way to learn and practice at the same time?\n\nAny must to use resources or roadmaps for someone starting fresh plz ?\n\nAny advice or feedback would be super appreciated. 🙏",

        "content": "Hello (programming) world!\n\nI'm a 30 year old who has always wanted to learn a bit of programming on the side.  Here and there I've sat down for a week or two and worked through some beginner python resources, but I've always struggled to stick with the learning process.\n\nBased on the advice I've seen, I think the biggest reason for this is that I've never been able to identify a particular project that I wanted to create.\n\nNow, I think I have an idea that I isn't too complicated--but I'm hoping to get some feedback regarding whether or not it's feasible and whether Python is the best choice.\n\n**Project Idea**\n\nI would like to create a program that could constantly scan a given subreddit, determine whether or not a post meets certain criteria, and if it does, send me a push notification with a link to the post.\n\nFox example, I am a fan of the Boston Celtics.  So let's take r/bostonceltics as a potential example.\n\nI would like to be able to tell me program to send me a notification if:\n\nThere is a new post on r/bostonceltics AND that post\n\n\\- Has the name \"Derek\" or \"Derek White\" in the title\n\n\\- Is a text post without a picture or link\n\n\\- Has 2 or fewer comments\n\n\\- Does not contain \"Brad\" or \"Brad Stevens\" in description.\n\nI would of course also like to be able to change these parameters and have multiple queries at once.\n\n  \nTo be clear, I don't want to create a bot to respond or create reddit spam--only be notified so I can then check out the post myself.\n\n\n\n**1. Is this a feasible idea in scope for a beginner to work towards?**\n\n**2. What are the likely roadblocks?**\n\n**3. What is the best programming language?**\n\nI read the subreddit FAQ and the other subreddit resources, and from what I can tell Python might be a decent choice for this, but I'd like to get some more experienced opinions before I fall down this rabbit hole.\n\nThank you so much for the help.",

        "content": "Lately, I’ve been realizing something about my journey in university — especially now that I’m in my second year. I’m not struggling with the subjects themselves. I’m struggling with caring about them the way the system expects me to.\n\nEvery time exams approach, I don’t feel scared, anxious, or even motivated. I just feel… detached. Because my goal isn’t to chase marks — it’s to understand, to learn, to build. What excites me isn’t memorizing for a grade, it’s learning cutting, learning something that actually connects with my future.\n\nBut the problem is that sometimes, the environment around you drains you before you even start. You see people studying hard to get top marks, while you’re there trying your best to understand — but there’s nothing to truly understand. You try to find meaning in what you study, but most teachers themselves aren’t motivated, and it kills your spark a little every day.\n\nLiving in Algeria doesn’t make it easier — the system feels heavy, exhausting, and uninspiring. You go to university, follow the hours, come back home drained, and even on your “rest days,” you don’t really rest. You just survive.\n\nAnd sometimes I ask myself: do students in other countries feel the same? Are they also fighting to keep their curiosity alive in a system that wants to turn everyone into the same mold?\n\nI’m not saying I hate studying. I actually love learning. I just wish learning wasn’t reduced to chasing numbers on a piece of paper.\n\nSo yeah, I’m excited to cut — to start my own path, to learn differently, to build something that feels alive. Because if the system can’t teach me what I was born to do, then I’ll teach myself.",

For example, they have this condition in a if :\n\n    if( e.type == SDL_QUIT )\n\nI don't get it. I know that SDL has an Enum called SDL\\_EventType which contains said SDL\\_QUIT but I don't understand how it works.

I was hoping I could get some thoughts from people who've been where I have and pushed through it.\n\nWhen I started, the company made it clear that they expected nothing from me, which I found a bit strange and it made me feel like my work didn't matter from the start. I was given my first project and I completed it in a month, I told my supervisor this and his reaction seemed more annoyed than pleased, and he said he would have to find something else for me to do if I don't slow down. He also explained that I had completed it much quicker than they expected (~3/4 months ahead of schedule). This made me feel great at the time; looking back, I fear they were just underestimating me.\n\nI tried to take some initiative. I taught myself to write cleaner code, did some reading, tried to push the idea behind my first project further and add some extra features while I had no other projects or tasks lined up.\n\nI eventually asked my supervisor for some more work and he put me onto doing bug fixes. I was happy at the time because it was helping me learn much more about the codebase, about the products they sell and I was making a difference, but 3 months later and there still wasn't any more projects lined up. I spoke to a couple of my friends also away on internships and they seem to be busy, with multiple projects waiting and with deadlines. It hurts even more when I see other members of staff working on projects I feel I would me more than capable of assisting them with and when I offer to help, they turn me away.\n\nThere have been monthly stand-ups where they joke about forgetting I'm there, I haven't had a single code review in the 5 months and when I ask management, they say they've been very busy. This makes me feel even more demoralized because if they're busy, why can't they get me to help?\n\nAdditionally, I just feel like I don't deserve to be there and like I'm expendable. My manager constantly jokes about how stupid people from my university are and I do try and laugh it off but it keeps making me feel even worse about being there. I even recall cases where they've been annoyed about me asking for help!\n\nI've contemplated trying to leave in favour of another intenrship, but I don't think it's possible to find another at this time in the year and I can't imagine me leaving 8 months early would look good on my resume. I feel trapped and like I'm not improving at all.\n\nHave any of you been in an internship like this?\n\nI would appreciate all your thoughts and opinions on this as I'm really struggling. \n",

My courses are completely online and asynchronous, which is great. But the resources provided are not always the greatest and expect completely green students to take in and have a full understanding of concepts that are more suited for those who have years of experience. The course is IT 315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design. I'm pretty nervous about it, as a lot of students have said it's the most difficult course they've taken throughout their studies. My understanding of programming/coding is extremely rudimentary at best, ranging from the MySpace days of editing HTML to a basic SQL class I took a few months back. That's about it. \n\nOur textbook for the course is Systems Analysis & Design: An Object-Oriented Approach with UML, 6th ed. I also just purchased a book called Head First Object Oriented Analysis & Design by Brett McLaughlin, which I have heard is great for a visual representation of the basics. Aside from actual books, does anyone have any online tutorials or videos that may be helpful for getting started here? From the very beginning of understanding the underlying concepts. The simpler, the better. I don't even know what UML is, other than that it stands for Unified Modeling Language. No idea what that means! Obviously Google will be my best friend for this class, but if anyone here has trusted resources that they've found helpful, I would definitely appreciate the guidance. TIA\n\nNote: I've already searched past threads on this and other subs for more information and resources. They weren't very helpful as most threads only had one or two replies.",

My only problem is that I don't feel confident in my programming skills.\n\nI really like programming, both in theory and in practice but ever since university I've felt that I'm always behind everyone, in part due to lack of practice and/or personal projects. Things have obviously improved since I started working (I started out as a FE dev) but I still don't feel good enough. I want to be improve my both for job security and also for myself so I can feel more confident. QA is great but it's not my passion life, if the opportunity arose for a good developer position, I would like to be able to grab it if I so desire.\n\nThat's why I'm looking for a good course or bootcamp program, ideally in Python and optionally in Playwright, but most languages are fine by me. Maybe something that really helped you or you swear by. I have around 1000€ in training budget that I have to spend until the end of the year so cost isn't a big issue.\n\nThanks in advance!",

My goal in programming is simply to solve code challenges ie codewars or leetcode and overtime getbetter at it.\n\nI find those challenges very hard thoug. I started recently. I have no idea about how to create algorithms nor any computer science foundation. My strategy is to google the algorithm for a specific problem or even better I ChatGpt it, and ask it to give me the pseudocode of a certain problem and I try to translate it to code.\n\nSome people are against it. I am not sure if this is the optimal approach though. By myself unless, it is something very simple like \"write the content of a pointer\" It feels very much impossible. Even the supposedly easy challenges are hard at this stage.\n\nMy question is, how to get better at it? Do you think my approach is wrong? Do you think I should stare at the computer for days until I come up with  a solution?

        "author": "Fwellimort",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I have over the past few years tried to help 6 CS students more directly through Discord, etc. All of whom claimed to be grinding, etc and so forth. Here has been my thoughts on what I noticed of college students and new grads.\n\nPS: I have over a dozen of students who had DMed for help, etc as well but those have always been casual reddit chats since I don't care anymore.\n\n\n\nMy thoughts on the job market:\n\n1. Job market for new grads and interns this year looks significantly better than the past 2 years.\n\n2. Offshoring is a reality which cannot be ignored. Companies are growing talent abroad now and a lot of layoffs have had their jobs moved to offshore. Unlike the past, offshore infra and talent is there. Covid 'proved' remote work works and 'offshore' == 'remote work'. Talent does not magically get better or worse depending on where the individual is located. And paying top dollar in Canada means entirely different from paying dollar in US.\n\n3. There's just too many CS majors and CS curriculums overall have become easier so schools can make more money. And there's so many CS adjacent majors sprouting left and right on top like Information Science, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational X, Computer Science + X, Information Systems, Informatics, Software Engineering, Business Information Management, etc.\n\nAnd then there's the fact a lot of Math, Physics, Statistics, Actuarial Science, etc students are minoring in CS as well. And Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, etc students all applying to CS jobs as well.\n\nThe supply of candidates is essentially infinite relative to demand for new grads.\n\n4. Resumes all look similar end of day due to Chatgpt. And honestly, what can you expect out of students. These are students, not working professionals. Truth is, the most differentiating factor is school name on a resume before any work experience.\n\n  \nThat said, at the same time, the talent and quality of new grads have significantly deteriorated. The median talent is on the floor (if there even is a floor). And a lot of them seems to be due to:\n\n1. Schools dumbing down curriculums + grade inflation (easier to graduate).\n\n2. Students doing bare minimum in school and just studying for the job interviews. Hence you see students here with 2.0 GPAs showing off the interviews they have gotten.\n\n3. CS is now really mainstream unlike in the way past in which programming was thought to be for nerds.\n\n4. Modern devices have abstracted away so much that students did not have to grow up having to deal with all sorts of bugs, frustrations, etc on the Internet.\n\n5. Chatgpt. It does homework, vibe coding, etc. Why bother spending the hours?\n\n6. There is a whole industry to min-maxing CS related job interviews. And the quality is really high as well. And a lot of information which in the past might have needed weeks of research is readily available within minutes now.\n\n7. TikTok brainwashing towards the world of instant gratifications. Students just don't want to deal with long frustrating grinds that go nowhere, etc.\n\n8. A lot of students going in claim to be 'passionate' in CS but really they are just majoring in it for the money or lifestyle they heard on TikTok, Youtube, etc. Now, I think 'passionate' is cringe but .. these students are all just really doing the bare minimum.\n\n  \n\\--------\n\nWhy am I saying this? Well.. while I do know Youtube is a bait, my direct experience with 6 CS students in this subreddit have largely been the same as the ones I found on Youtube.\n\nIn fact, I would argue the ones on Youtube look like god talent relative to most of the 6 CS students here in this subreddit I interacted on Discord.\n\nWhat Youtube videos you might ask? This is from Coding Jesus Youtube channel which is extremely baity and really there for him to advertise his own site but...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM\\_3yM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM_3yM)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s\\_ztBwg7Vls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ztBwg7Vls)\n\nLet me just say ... most of the 6 CS students in this subreddit over the years I interacted on Discord... makes those candidates look like top talent.\n\nI have come to believe that we seriously need more gatekeeping in this field. Completely agree with Coding Jesus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA)\n\n  \nOn the hiring side, most students are flat out garbage. But the problem is **student resumes despite how well done at aggregate will always look similar before actual work experience**. \n\nHence on the company side, the only way to filter is largely by school names at aggregate. And trust me when I say this, most students at \"top schools\" nowadays are flat out garbage as well. The difference being AT LEAST the students at top schools tend to be good at Leetcode. At least that bare minimum is done.\n\nThe worst part of all this is actual talent cannot be differentiated either from the rest as well. And with so much cheaters everywhere, it's just impossible to tell who is actually good from others.\n\n  \nIt has been frustrating and a huge waste of time trying to help some students here in this subreddit only to learn that they ddn't even bother to do the bare minimum. I'm sorry but if you cannot do a basic easy-medium Leetcode question and are screaming for how the world is unfair and what not claiming you have been grinding and doing everything... then you are not fit for this field. Get out.\n\nIt's been a huge waste of my time and a huge eye opening over the years how bad most CS students are lately when it comes to CS. And the best part? Every one of them at the start talked as if they thought differently of themselves.\n\n  \nBut ya.. just me rambling. Just wanted to share this. Also, good luck college students with the job market. I know it's rough. My only real advice to you is .... well, look into C++ if you are serious about software engineering and want to differentiate yourself from others. Totally agree with this recruiter as well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA)\n\n\nNote: I still am helping one of them and plan to for the next few years (been helping for two years now).

Was about a 20k bump over my current role so I decided to jump in.\n\nHere’s how it went:\n\n1.) External Lead Recruiter conversation\n2.) External Business Partner conversation (direct report of #1)\n3.) Take-home assignment via Coderbyte\n4.) Discussion with CTO, including reviewing my takehome\n5.) Live leetcoding round - 2 engineers\n6.) Live system design round - 2 engineers\n7.) Behavioral interview - 1 QA engineer, 1 implementation engineer, 1 product manager\n\nAt this point, I figured I was just about done and was about to receive an offer.\n\nNo - I then received a message about them wanting me to meet their CEO for a “quick chat” - fine. As I prepare for that, I then receive another message that they just hired a new Head of Engineering and they would like me to meet with them BEFORE the CEO.\n\nInsane, right? But the market is the market so I persevere.\n\nAs I await the meeting with the Head of Engineering today, I get a call from the recruiter informing me that there was a “miscommunication” and that they will not hire in my state, NOR the one I plan to move to in a few weeks! (Florida -> Illinois) \n\nI was completely transparent about my location/relocation, with my current location being on my resume and LinkedIn (where they found me). The fact that this was not internally discussed prior to me going through the whole process is extremely inconsiderate of my and other candidates’ time.\n\nExtremely frustrating, but hey, maybe I dodged a bullet. If they are this disorganized during interviewing, it would probably be a nightmare to work for. They are also going through a re-org, after being acquired by private equity a few weeks ago.\n\nIt sucked getting the call - especially after talking to 10 people about the role - but my interview skills now are sharper. We push forward.",

It was my dream right out of college — to create something of my own. But the business never really grew, and now it’s collapsing.\n\nIn the early years, I was hands-on with coding and loved it. But over time, I shifted into management — dealing with clients, projects, and day-to-day operations. Somewhere along the way, I drifted away from actual development.\n\nNow I’m trying to get back into a software engineering job, and honestly, I feel completely lost. The industry feels miles ahead of where I left it. I want to code again, but I’m unsure which direction to go.\n\nMy current skills:\n\nLaravel/PHP — intermediate\n\nReactJS — entry-level\n\nDevOps/System design — intermediate\n\n\nI’m considering:\n\n1. Focusing on ReactJS to go full-stack (though I don’t enjoy frontend work much)\n\n\n2. Diving deeper into DevOps, which I actually like\n\n\n3. Exploring something new like Web3 or AI — though it feels intimidating/exciting\n\n\n\nI’d love advice from anyone within the industry:\n\nWhat’s the most realistic path forward?\n\nShould I specialize or rebuild as a generalist?\n\nFeeling a bit lost and could really use some direction.

I pushed a bad PR and commits that caused some issues to an important branch. Nothing in prod was affected but a couple engineers had to spend a day or two fixing my mistake and it did end up being a high priority issue that blocked some people. Mostly everyone was nice except a devops engineer who found the issue and was thorough about letting everyone know in every chat that I was the cause of the block. So its pretty well known to everyone that I messed up big-time. I merged a PR to the wrong branch without getting a review because I thought it wasnt required for this branch. \n\nI wouldnt usually be worried but we did have layoffs recently and I know an Eng2 who did get laid off during that cycle due to \"performance issues.\" So this has me thinking im on the top of the list for the next lay offs. Maybe its best to get ahead of this now and start interviewing at other companies sooner than later? Its my fault so im thinking i should try to leave ASAP and start fresh somewhere new?\n\nNote: New Grad Eng1 that started 4 months ago",

So, stupid question: are influencers just taking these videos out-of-hours so as not to get in people's ways, or have remote and hybrid schedules actually emptied offices to this extent? And if the latter, and you're working in one, how do you feel about it? I completely understand the benefits of WFH, but these videos of office days always just look a bit sad!",

Possible (this hurts the most)\n\nMy first website was a Joomla-Drupal website (PHP/HTML/CSS) back in...2006! I was spending my christmas holidays as CS student trying to fix CSS issues and launch my \"unique idea\" (it kind of was but I had no idea how to monetize or grow at my 22 years).\n\nA career came relatively easy in the richer northern EU countries with plenty of corporate, slow paced jobs (cruising/rest and vest) (without really vesting anything - no stocks).\n\nLooking back I probably wasted my first 5 years of work with minor skill building in CSS. I did get pretty good in CSS though.\n\nEnter JS hype circa 2015. I Suddenly realize I was a pixel pusher / HTML-CSS guy who barely understood how jQuery worked and my JS skills were close to 0. hoisting? closures? MVVM? wtf are you talking about? I can tell you whats the difference of relative/absolute positioning and the box model, but you're not really interested are you?\n\nA lack of effort in personal projects, lack of studying the proper material, and a choice of relatively comfortable jobs that did not use Angular/Backbone or React (early days) meant I stayed behind.\n\nAround 2017 I realize I need to do something. I start grinding JS problems, non stop interviewing, codewars, and other learning platforms. I get into my first full time VueJS projects after a whiteboard recursion test and a coding challenge. Only problem: I hated the role, the product, and the people. \n\nI get into two more gigs in VueJS projects for a period of a total of 6 years in Vue. And that means: I get left out of the ReactJS game. One more thing to play catchup on.\n\nI wake up on morning and realize it's been 15 years I am coding professionally. Most of the peers I've worked with are in Lead, Senior Manager, Investor (!!) roles.\n\nI'm still doing take home code challenges, leetcode live interviews - to which I suck -, and struggling to get decent Senior SE roles.\n\nI keep interviewing, and something lands on my lap: I take over the tech of a startup without engineers. NextJS, Mongo, AWS, the whole shebang.  I m getting good at harder concepts. Do a little of AWS, deployments, backend. AI is happening, this helps. But I hate the product, and I'm working for half the salary I was making before. I get a contract at a FinTech which paid double. 3 months later I'm let go because of \"reasons\".\n\nthe job market shitshow is here. The TRUMP / Putin / War / Interest Rate bullshit all are happening. I'm trying to get jobs and interview but my age is catching up on me. My eyes are more easily tired. So is my lower back.\n\nMy net worth is decent, but not one to say I can \"FIRE\". Nor do I want to.\n\nDespair is setting in.",

        "content": "I recently fully vested at the startup I’m at. In the time I’ve been here my shares have gone 10x, and the business is exploding and has become the runaway leader in its sector. A highly profitable IPO looks to be in the cards in the next few years. I have gotten refresher equity over the years, such that my TC is reasonable for 13 YOE. If they were to just 2x again on IPO, I’d be looking at a healthy 8-figure payout after taxes. But of course, that is paper money and is in no way guaranteed (though my insider knowledge has me pretty bullish). \n\nThe only two major downsides are as follows: I’ve been enduring a brutal 3 hour/day 3 day/week commute with kids at home. And two, I haven’t been able to purchase all my options. Only about 2/3. The pop in valuation coincided with having kids and I just couldn’t justify buying the options at the time, nor was I quite as bullish then. I’d need 3x more than I have in liquid savings to buy out the rest of the options due to taxes, and with every valuation pop that gets harder. I lose these unexercised options if I leave (classic golden handcuffs)\n\nI recently interviewed at a smaller, but still unicorn-level startup in the same sector. Its office is only 20 minutes away and has flexible hybrid hours. The offer is to lead a team at a >25% cash bump with a ~10% drop in equity depending on how you math some of the parameters. Overall a >15% TC upgrade at current valuations. It’s a paper career upgrade, but my biggest concern is trading out favorable pre-ISO RSU paper money where I am for paper equity in an as-of-yet less successful startup.\n\nThere’s a quality of life question that’s near and dear to my heart, but if the trade ends up being multiple 7 figures a couple years from now, I’d kick myself forever. \n\nAny of you have some advice here? Would you leave some shares on the table at a slam-dunk startup for a higher risk promotion and some QoL improvements?",

        "content": "So I'm a junior cloud engineer, working for around a year now in my first job straight out of uni. I was hired with another junior, but he has a masters and 2 prior years of work experience so I was hired for my \"potential\" whereas he was actually selected for his skillset too. I have no problem with that, I'm happy to learn and grow as fast as I can. \n\nMy manager however, seemingly doesn't want me to forget how much better he is than me. Here are some things that have been said during our 1-on-1s, without me ever mentioning him (for the story's sake, we'll call him Tyler).\n\n\"You're doing well, you don't need to compare yourself with Tyler.\" I never was.\n\n\"You are doing your tasks and learning a lot of things, *it's not super great but that's what we expect from you*. Of course we can't expect for you to be an expert. Tyler is different, he has had experience before\"\n\n\"You are real junior here to be honest, if Tyler applied for a mid level role he would've gotten in, we just hired him as a way to get him in the company. So don't worry about him.\"\n\n\"You are an early career experiment, we want to see how we can develop people from zero, but Tyler is not really a junior to be honest\"\n\nAmongst other things. I don't know if I'm just being sensitive to some very normal or mildly negative feedback, but I just don't understand how I'm supposed to respond to these. I feel like I'm having my inferiority drilled in to me again and again, even when me and Tyler are not working in even remotely similar things. I also find it not productive to have him as an arbitrary benchmark, and spend less time focusing on my performance and growth in isolation. My other coworkers are actually giving me plenty of props and good feedback and think I'm learning super fast, but I feel like I'm not perceived as good as I would've been by my manager if Tyler wasn't working alongside. If I was hired for my potential, then why don't we spend most of our attention maximizing it?\n\nAnother annoying thing is our objective setting. We've done this process twice now. The first time, I made mine quite compact and Tyler made his more elaborated. Our manager said \"we could make yours a bit more like Tyler's, see how he made his a little clearer?\". Yup, absolutely. That makes sense.\n\nBut the next cycle, he had his very short. Almost lazy. It was literally just a bullet point of the stacks he wants to learn and get to work with. Whereas I elaborated on mine more specifically. But guess what? \"We can make it similar to Tyler's one just so its easier.\"\n\nSo what the hell. I get that he's older, more educated, more experienced and most importantly, he's a he. I don't want to link these treatments to me being the only girl in the team and the youngest member by a lot, but I can't help to think those things play a part.\n\nOr, alternatively, I could be overthinking and these are perfectly normal parts of a manager's evaluations. In which case Im happy to learn to get used to it and move on with my life.\n\nI have recently had a hiring manager reach out to me for a position in a different company. I've cleared a few interview rounds and they've said they're willing to offer me a 20% pay raise, with a sign on bonus and stock which I don't currently get at my company. I don't wanna leave my current place for some other reasons that compensate the lower pay, but if this treatment isn't normal I might just consider leaving. However, that also lets me know that I don't suck, so I'm really not sure of what to think anymore now.",

During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.\n\nEvery time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.\n\nBack in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.\n\nI’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.\n\nThe good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems. I’m practicing on LeetCode, trying to solve problems on my own, and I also started following the Coding Interview University roadmap. Right now, I’m working on a new project using this approach where ChatGPT only acts as a mentor instead of a code generator. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I finally feel like I’m actually learning something.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this after finishing school or a bootcamp? How did you transition from guided learning to being able to code independently? What helped you get through the feeling of being completely lost once the structure was gone?\n\nThanks for reading. I just needed to share this somewhere where people might understand.",

But how do you communicate that intensity to non-technical people, without sounding ungrateful or dramatic? How do you deal with people getting jealous about something you find extremely difficult?\n\nEdit: Just want to share!

I want to build up my resume but I will be out of a job in 3 weeks.\n\nBut then I came across Revature for their “Entry Level Software Developer” position, and they actually called me.

It’s a contract? At a high-level, what does this contract entail? Is it true that I’d have to relocate? I live in NJ, is it possible I’d have to fly to the West? More importantly, will I know important details like which state before signing the contract? And, is the wage livable?\n\nI’m reading that while it’s bottom of the barrel, it’s not a scam.

Career choices, life choices, and all this affects the people around me.\n\nI'm a decent engineer. I've built stuff, I've solved problems. I know my FE shit.\n\nSince end of August I've participated in several processes, both startups and non startups. I am not in the US/UK ecosystem (S.Europe here) so I am trying to be relatively picky with my choices (I am getting less picky as we go of course).\n\nI recently was rejected after delivering a coding assignment - following two very nice (good vibes) calls with the two founders of a startup.\n\nHere is the weird part. I am pretty confident on my delivery. The assignment had a lot business detail, one had to think of what it actually needed - but thanks to AI - I delivered. Finishing touches mine, and I was prepared to answer any questions about the code. We even had a follow-up call planned to talk about the challenge.\n\n24 hours later, I receive the most generic rejection message ever - nothing about the challenge , and a cancellation of the follow-up call. I've messaged the guy who I was in touch with - and he wrote something super abstract like \"we wanted to see how you would approach the problem\" and \"we didnt see the depth we were looking for\". (honestly I dont buy it)\n\nI accidentally noticed that one of their engineers was stalking my Linkedin Profile a few hours before the rejection mail arrived. I was generally vocal about the \"AI Bubble\" and I am wondering if the fact that their business was AI-driven had something to do with it?\n\nThe other thing I am thinking is that the guy who visited my profile only did so after I spoke with the two founders so he decided for one or the other reason I am not a good fit - so they had nothing to say about the code by itself.\n\nNeedless to say this is a brutal market, and I have never seen so challenging interview processes, so lengthy filtering mechanisms. I happen to also be in a relatively small market so this might have to do with it. Remote gigs are harder to find these days.\n\nWhat the heck should I do? I am not a top 10% coder but I'm good enough for most normal businesses. I don't grind Leetcode, and I do suffer from live coding brain freeze which I am trying to battle by doing a lot of live coding interviews. But it is \\_very\\_ easy for an interviewer to find reasons to reject you.\n\nI have excellent soft skill presentation, most recruiters / HR folk are super happy with me, I present myself in an excellent manner.\n\nThe other day I was prepared to answer a specific live coding challenge following tips from the recruiter. I did it async before the call, almost memorized it.\n\nDuring live coding it, I froze because the API wasnt returning the response I was thinking it would. It took me like 5' to solve the bug.\n\nRejected",

The constant stress at work has drained me to the point where I feel like I have no motivation left.\n\nI’m leading a project right now, and it’s been rough. The environment is cutthroat, deadlines are unrealistic, and the infrastructure we depend on is poor. My manager is honestly quite incompetent there’s no real support or guidance. Most of the people I’m working with have been struggling too, and aside from a couple of reliable teammates, I’ve had to pick up the slack for others just to keep the project moving.\n\nI’ve been fighting to unblock issues every single day, often taking on extra work to make sure we don’t fall behind. But now we’ve hit a problem , I missed some edge cases earlier in the design, and we might need to pivot to a new design for a small part of the project just a week before launch. I fully accept my mistake, but I can’t stop worrying about how this will reflect on me. With deadlines approaching, I’m terrified this will affect my performance review or even put me on a PIP.\n\nWhat’s making it worse is the exhaustion. I’ve spent so much energy fixing things that were never really my fault in the first place, finding workarounds, reviewers nitpicking and getting alignments, and now that I’m facing my own blocker, I just don’t have the will to deal with it. It feels like I’ve been holding this project together while slowly falling apart myself.\n\nI’m not sure what to do at this point, part of me wants to keep pushing, but another part just wants to stop caring altogether. Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you handle it when you were stuck between burnout, guilt, and fear of being penalized?",

Apparently they don’t think the same way. Minutes passed, no one joined. I waited for **20 minutes** and just when I was about to leave he finally joined. No apology for being late, no acknowledgment, and honestly he didn’t even seem to care about the call. He wasn’t paying attention, barely looked at me, and was probably scrolling on his phone the whole time.\n\nI had a few doubts about the startup, mainly what their *work culture* is like and what I should expect from this so-called “work trial.” When I tried to make conversation and ask about these things, he gave one-line answers and told me to email my GitHub and portfolio links (which I had already shared along with my resume a week ago). The meeting lasted barely **four minutes**.\n\nNow here’s where it gets weird:\n\n1. I couldn’t find a single solid resource about what this startup actually does or builds. Their website is just a plain landing page with almost no info.\n2. They claim to be backed by a bunch of VCs, but after checking the official portfolios of those firms, I couldn’t find *Corgi* listed anywhere except for one out of the six they mention.\n3. Their work culture looks sketchy. I saw posts where they proudly mentioned gifting mattresses to employees so they can “stay in the office 24/7.”\n\nFor a startup that floods LinkedIn with posts about hiring “engineers” (basically glorified 24/7 slaves), this entire interaction felt really off and suspicious.\n\nHas anyone else heard of or interacted with this startup? Everything about them screams red flag to me.",

I'm super early in my job search, so I know it might just take time to hear back from some companies.\n\nWhen I was laid off, I was trying to conceive with my husband for a couple of months, so this was a really bad time for me to lose my job. \n\nI have 3.5 years of experience working with mostly Vue and TypeScript. I did learn React at bootcamp and have been diving back into studying it since I know it's in higher demand. The thing is, I don't think I can mentally handle the grind in this field. When I first started out, I was hungry, driven, ambitious, and excited to code. I was extremely lucky to land a job 2 months after graduating from bootcamp, and tech was a lot easier to break into. \n\nNow I'm in my 30s, I want kids, and I don't have as much motivation to hustle.\n\nAs much as I love coding, I don't love the concept of having to grind constantly when I want to focus on family building and family life. Just the process of getting through dev interviews feels insane right now. Grinding leetcode, memorizing a ton of system design questions, doing tons of projects to practice different technologies, going through several rounds of interviews, only to possibly get rejected at the last stage? And then maybe having to do it ALL over again if you get laid off a year or 2 later? \n\nI've been studying my ass off the past few weeks and it got me thinking, if I'm finding this super exhausting now with no kids, how the hell am I gonna do this again if I were to get laid off again with a toddler or 2? Yes I would of course have support from my husband, but I don't know if it's realistic for me personally to constantly be trying to hustle at work, hustle while being laid off, and be a parent to young children. \n\nI keep seeing posts from people who have been laid off multiple times in a year and the idea of having to go through the  interview process more than once in a year sounds horrible. Plus, I SUCK at leetcode. I'm a great dev, but leetcode has always been a weakness of mine.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas of where I could pivot in tech? I want to learn more about roles that don't require such stressful interview processes.  Thank you in advance.",

I'd appreciate any strategic advice, especially concerning the current job market.\nMy Current Situation\nI lead a small team as a Tech Lead/Senior Frontend Developer. The problem is, I’m the only truly experienced frontend person here. My team members, while good people, are generally junior or mid-level, and honestly, they often just want to get tasks done with minimal effort.\n * Code Quality: The code I review is frequently poor—written just to pass the ticket, not to be clean or maintainable.\n * Stagnation Fear: When I do code reviews, I often worry that I'm not just failing to grow, but actually regressing. I have no one more experienced than me in frontend to learn from, which makes me feel professionally trapped.\n * The Dilemma: My role is to mentor them (which I try to do through detailed code reviews and discussions), but constantly dealing with low-quality code makes me paranoid that I'm absorbing bad habits myself.\nThe Challenge\nI need advice on how to combat this feeling of stagnation and ensure I keep growing my skills (especially technical ones like architecture and modern patterns).\nCrucially, I have very little time outside of work for side projects or intense studying. I need strategies to develop myself during work hours within the confines of my current role and project.\nMy Questions for the Community\n * In-Job Development: What are the most effective ways for a senior/lead to force their own growth technically when surrounded by less-experienced developers, especially when time after work is scarce? (e.g., specific code review tactics, using project architecture as a growth tool, etc.)\n * Market Strategy: Given the competitive nature of the current tech job market (layoffs, high competition for senior roles):\n   * When is the right time to leave? Should I wait until I can find a role that guarantees working with better talent?\n   * How do I best position my current leadership role (leading a small team, improving code quality) for interviews at top-tier companies that value deep technical expertise?\n * Mindset: How do you mentally cope with being the \"only source of truth\" and avoid the burnout/frustration that comes from constantly correcting fundamental issues?\nThanks in advance for any insights on maintaining momentum and making a strategic career move!\n",

        "content": "SDE2 of 7 YoE. I've been reorg'd to my current team 1.5 years ago, and it's been a nightmare. I'm not interested in my team's product, state of engineering wants to pull your hair out, and my manager is borderline toxic. WLB is great and I love my people (outside of my manager), but I've felt incredibly stagnant in my career for awhile and feel miserable. I've been on a burnout for months that's been gradually increasing, and I know that things won't significantly improve anytime soon. \n\nI've originally planned to find a position within the company to transfer internally, and it's been 3 months since I started browsing around. Now, it feels like I might be better off to take a full plunge and prep for interviewing other companies for few reasons:\n\n1. I've been having golden handcuff, but my salary is tanking hard in less than a year once my 4 year RSU runs out. At that point, I'm only losing a modest amount of salary to jump ship to other company's SDE2 position (according to levels.fyi). That's not even considering a slim chance that I make the hiring bar for senior in some companies. There is no path for promotion within my current company for awhile, anyways. I've saved enough to last for awhile.\n2. Due to the company policy, it's practically impossible for me to transfer internally for another half a year without painting myself a target. Honestly unsure if my mental health will remain sane until then.\n3. I've been on GC process for a bit (completed I-140 w/ EB3 using TN). Given the state of current administration, it's very unlikely that mine will be processed in a reasonable time. Might as well keep the priority date and resume as EB-2 at another company.\n4. Tied to GC process above, I can only internally transfer to positions within my city. I'm on a branch office away from HQ, and the options are pretty small. I don't have much things to bind me to the city outside of GC process, and am honestly okay relocating.\n5. I've been border locked for the entire year, and will continue to be so until GC is approved - immigration attorney strongly advises not to travel internationally. Not only does changing company mostly address that risk (since I'll have to restart with PERM), it gives me an option to get a sizeable amount of vacation in-between jobs. I've been dying to travel abroad again, albeit this is not a big reason to sabotage anything on my job.\n\n  \nI'm leaving the team in the earliest opportunity for sure. I just need to choose between finding an internal position within my current city and company, or fully commit to searching outside. I've heard many anecdotes of how terrible the job market is now, how insane the hiring bars are. The uncertainty with recession also adds a risk of layoffs, which tends to target less contributing employees including new hires.\n\nAm I crazy to consider jumping ship in this market?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Before I explain what's going on let me start by saying my brother is probably the least greedy, most trustworthy person on this planet. So I'm not worried that he'll try to screw me over, its that I don't have any idea what would be a fair way to charge for something of this nature since it'll basically be entirely my creation from the ground up that is using the data he is supplying. So general advice on books to read or websites to go for advice on the best practices for deciding the monetary value of certain work or current industry practices for different types of work would also be welcome.\n\n# So here's what's happening:\n\nMy brother has an idea for a service he wants to offer to the clients in his day job. Basically its a really confusing field and he wants to charge subscription access to his clients for a website that basically presents all this data for the client in plain English. This is a big deal because there are TONS of these JSON collections of rules and trust me, trying to figure it out from badly named JSON files with confusingly named key : value pairs is insanity. Presumably this info must have existed at one point, but that's kind of the thing: the whole system is so big and convoluted and there's no easily accessible source of info about it.\n\nThe reason he contacted me is cuz he wants a program that can take these complicated collections of rules and make sense of them then put them on the internet somewhere so people can access a plain English description of the interactions and uses of them. \n\n# What's the issue?\n\nThe issue is that I have a crazy amount of extremely varied experience I have that is allowing me to work on this solo and make something that will actually be a decent software. I've been so interested in data science and ML that I went back for my second bachelor's degree because of it I was certified in TensorFlow years ago, and have been using ChatGPT since before it was the the all-accessible great-god-genie that it is today. You used to have to apply for it by submitting how you planned to use it back when it was still in its infant stages.\n\nAnyway its a ton of school,, internship, job, and hobby work that I've done that's put me in a position where I know I can solo build this entire thing for sure.  I've already created a model that \"seems\" to be able to pull this off. (I have no idea if its correct cuz its not my field, but my bro says the ones I showed him appear to be mostly correct. Obviously its gonna take a good bit of fine tuning, but I'm not worried in the least that this is going to work out.)\n\nSo basically I'm going to be 100% making all the decisions of how to design and code and use the models, code and organize all the data collection and storage on the backend, and code all the website design, and do the hosting, testing, CI/CD etc. Every bit of the software that powers this whole endeavor is going to be made by me.\n\n# So what the F'ing F  is fair for me to ask for as compensation?\n\nI don't like the idea of just charging an hourly wage and having to give up something that is all my work. But also I have no intentions or desire to screw my brother on this either. I'm only getting this opportunity cuz he knows me and has the insight to know this is something that his clients would be very happy to have.\n\nAlso the amount of hours I'll put in is not equal to the amount of work that I'm  getting done. A lot of the work is going to be done in the background as my software goes through all this data and creates useful output that's then organized in a way that it can all be dumped in a database and easily retrieved through a site made with Django.\n\nOh and there's multiple clients each with their own sets of rules and things so finding a way to make my database schema universal (or as close to universal as possible) between clients is going to go a long way to prevent me from having to hardcode all of these for each client by hand. \n\nThe idea is if he picks up another client, we can just dump the data to my system and it will parse it, decode it, and add it all to the database (and through the magic of Django, create a whole bunch of webpages using that data that don't have to be coded by hand).\n\nSo please, if you have experience working on anything like this or working for a company deciding what to charge clients or know any ways I could learn about that I could really use the info.\n\nI've always worked for someone else at an hourly wage, so I have no idea how what to do otherwise. I just don't feel like being paid an hourly wage to work on this is fair. And I'd have no idea how to even figure out how much of a percentage to ask for if I want to split the profits from the subscription sales.",

I didn't want to be a bad employee so I left. He didn't even care. \n* Got an offer in 2 weeks for a total of 7% less yearly compensation of my previous role and NOTE for a fintech company.\n* I was expecting a 2-times per year salary re-negotiation but policy changed.\n* I got a 2,26% salary increase last January.\n* I was promised a better raise this year.\n* I worked my ass off to evolve more. Almost finished my MSc in CS.\n* I accepted to talk about a new offer ONCE and without even trying they accessed my skill was worth a 25% increase in salary and a seniority role - I get to mentor entry/juniors.\n* It is 100% better choice for me to leave, but feeling remorse cause my current team which are great people will get destroyed.\n\n  \nSome more notes for the company:\n\n1. Year closed with 50% profit increase.\n2. New offices in new city\n3. New AI team and hired like 20 ( I am assuming expensive ) AI engineers over they year.\n4. Developer left team in January, I got his workload - no salary increase, never got a replacement.\n5. Team got 3 new projects in September.\n6. Core developer was owed 200 hours of overtime and eventually instead of paying they gave him a 4 day work week for the next few months..... SAD?\n\nSUMMARY;   \nΤo me it feels like in this company my worth is less and it gets depicted in salary.   \nCompany will try to match offer only because they are in dire position.  I don't think this much of a raise would be ever considered.  \nThis means they don't value me as they should or my worth is less here and I will be better of switching anyway.  \nThe new company is purely software development oriented vs current FINTECH.",

Some of these definitely annoyed or upset me on the day, but I don’t think about them on a regular basis. The point is— should I have been upset or annoyed at all?\n\nThere’s been a few instances over the past 5 years where I stayed up at night thinking of people’s actions and comments. I feel like nearly all of the comments and actions were justified, so I think I’m just too emotional and sensitive. I shared some of these with friends, and they all say I’m not being too sensitive, but I also almost never hear them complaining about anything like this (their complaints are usually of the shape “my managers putting me on a dead end project” or “my manager is not acknowledging my contributions”)\n\nCurious how people would react in any of the circumstances:\n\n* When I was a junior with 2 yoe, I wrote a cl and sent it to someone I’ve been working with, and he scheduled a 1:1 to talk about it. During the meeting, he gave some helpful (but maybe controversial? My tl didn’t agree with the final shape of the cl) advice, but at the same time he was laughing at my code and asking why I did this, and that Im surely smarter than him because I graduated from Caltech. I think I didn’t have a good reason beside it made sense to me. \n\n\n* I switched companies after just over 2.5 years. After about 10 months , my manager told me that my growth trajectory isn’t as good as <new grad who started 3 month after me>, and that I’d benefit from more local mentorship (the brain of the project is in hongkong, as was my manager. I’m based in the us)\n\n\n* A manager some levels above me mentioned that he’d rather work with smart assholes than people who are nice but slightly incompetent. (Though to be clear, we’re not hiring either)\n\n\n* My manager is also an IC (he only manages me), and he was the main reviewer for a cl I worked on. Another coworker left a comment and I tried to talk to my manager about these comments first. He cut me off both times. The first time was me saying oh “triggers are a good idea”, and he replied. “Yeah yeah, I saw his comment”. The second time was “are you available at 2:30? I…” “I have a meeting then”. I ask dumb questions so it’s pretty normal to get cut off, but what really annoyed me was securing our 1:1 the next day, he ask what triggers are.\n(I told this interaction to another younger coworker, and his response was I shouldn’t be emotional at work and that I should talk to my manager, which I did do weeks ago.)\n",

It feels as if there is an ocean of things that I need to learn before I can even be considered as a serious junior candidate. I dont even know where to begin.

But even then, this is a miniscule thing and—I dont think—of any interest to any employers. There's also the AI BS, making it feel mega inefficient to do anything by hand (and actually trying to learn), as opposed to just vibing some slop out.\n\nI dont know, what do I even do? I'm thinking of doing my masters in CS come next year if I cant find anything, but I dont really have any particular interest in CS research and it would just amount to kicking the can down the road. I'm also fine like really doubling down on trying to improve core CS skills if that is what's missing to get a job, but I dont think an employer gives a damn about me knowing my DS&As.\n\nWhat do I do?",

I have found ways to force them to fit a handful of scenarios, but I just don't have enough content to cover all the possible questions. On top of that it's been so long that I can't remember enough detail about my work or team interactions when an interviewer drills down on a project/topic (in retrospect I should have kept a work diary for reference). I end up having to improvise, which always goes poorly and I feel like I'm coming off as a fraud. What should I do for behavioral interviews going forward? Should I just admit to interviewers that I haven't gotten to do much and want a chance to prove myself? Make up embellishments to my experience? Find a new career? I've been unemployed searching for over a year to no avail so any advice on this would be appreciated.",

Can I get away trying to rob this guys or am I better hopping off this before they trap me with some shit?

It's better than getting nothing like before but it still is effectively nothing. It just doesn't feel like I have anything \"compelling\" to say about any of my experience and I don't know how to get that good experience. I've been spending all day every day doing \"nothing\" (working on projects that are still unpresentable, sending applications that mostly go nowhere), I don't know what I should be doing at all. Everything I do feels like the wrong answer no matter what. Working on the projects I already have feels useless as they are not presentable (they visually look bad, they are not profitable at this moment, and have absolutely no real technical challenges to them at all)\n\nI don't feel like I have any \"difficult\" or \"interesting\" projects to show people, like I don't have anything difficult to show how I struggled because everything I did always felt \"easy\" or it always becomes \"easy\" in hindsight. Even if something took a long time to fix or figure out, in hindsight it is always easy so hiring people will see it as being easy too so I can't really talk about them being struggles. It looks badly on me if I talk about how I figured out how to find the assembly code that touches some struct value for a game mod, because any IDE nowadays would have that same functionality just 2 clicks away. And it's not really impressive for me to build a menu or web page or a web server because those are standard basic level things. It's also not impressive for me to implement some algorithm or use some API because applying some algorithm someone else already wrote is not applying my own thinking and using some API is just using someone else's code which is not impressive to do. Making my own variant chess engine isn't impressive because it's just me following a preset list of things to do to make the engine (and the new stuff is not technically difficult to do as it's more of the same techniques that I am not a pioneer of) So in any case everything I've done is not impressive, any half competent developer could do anything I've done and they would probably do it faster and better in every way.\n\nInterview / call wise I don't really know how to improve, I always feel like I give short answers but I don't know how to make them longer without rambling about useless things? (Like I can't tell them about every individual class I took in response to \"tell me about yourself\"). I don't know the way to \"fluff up\" my answers to impress them, it feels like if I try too hard it just backfires on me (like if I hype up some web page up as the best thing ever but in reality it looks like the default CSS styling (Graphic design is not my passion) it makes me look stupid). I don't even have real answers for some of the questions they have, like I can't talk about any conflicts I had with others (internships were basically me working alone on projects, class projects never had any big blowups that I was the one fixing everything completely) or talk about something I had difficulty learning about to build a project (it looks bad on me if I talk about learning something \"basic\" but I don't know anything too \"advanced\"?)\n\nMaybe I'm just not cut out for this field as the standards have gotten so much higher nowadays? Looking at another recent post about how bad current CS grads are there are questions that other people failed that I don't know the complete answer to without looking up the exact specifics. I don't memorize the exact programming language / package versions I use (and I'm not exactly using cutting edge features or the most esoteric library functions either). (I know it's just like project settings or looking at compiler settings but it isn't something I have memorized which I'm supposed to be doing?). I also don't have memorized exactly how the programming languages are implemented (like where exactly a method in a class is stored in python? I know it probably ends up in code memory and internally there is some data structure corresponding to that class and some kind of data structure for the references to the methods of the class, but I don't know the exact specifics like which specific implementation of methods and classes it is using internally)",

        "content": "Some back story:\n\nA few years ago I started working for a company that was pretty small. The people were nice, I was well taken care of, owners and management were generous. We landed big clients and the company was eventually bought out for a good sum of money (at least 2 million). The owners generously gave us a big bonus for the buyout and even negotiated that we keep our jobs for at least 2 years with the new company. After the period we were eventually let go and found new jobs elsewhere.\n\nYesterday I got a message from my old boss asking if id be interested in working on something on the side. I said id be interested in thinking about it, but my life is busy right now. They said theyd work around my schedule. I'm interested in hearing them out, but im wondering what i should ask for compensation. Development could possibly be split by another dev. And i would only be providing dev work. \n\n I'm not hurting for money, but im certainly not going to turn it down lol. Im sure they will probably offer me a wage or lump sum when we hit MVP, but Im more so wondering if i should ask for a share of profits. And if so how much? I should probably hear about the idea first before i decide, but they're smart people, so I have a feeling this idea could be profitable as well. ",

        "content": "If I can get a little sentimental first, I can still remember my very first program I ever wrote and turned in to some kind of final project. It was a HEAVILY pixelated Batman Logo drawn painstakingly with Apple Basic on a bulky monochrome Apple IIe. I can also remember the first time I dived into, learned and modified to my own needs source code from someone else, Oregon Trail also on that same Apple IIe model (though sometimes I'd be lucky enough to get one with the RGB monitors for the glorious 4 bit palette).\n\n  \nOver 35 years and a rich career later I've never lost the thrill and excitement of those moments. Until my latest project.\n\n  \nI play with all kinds of stuff on my free time from Arduino contraptions, to writing super niche tools for just me and my family. In my work I've mostly made the kind of software that would be considered tooling and in the majority of cases the automation processes using said tooling. \n\n  \nI've always hated the limelight, just knowing 10's to 100's of thousands of other employees were able to work more efficiently because of me has always been what drives me, that and the confidence in decades of designing highly resilient, and easily used tools and processes that only ever broke when infrastructure out of my control and foresight were changed. As part of that I've embraced the negative part of that. I'm constantly compared to my fellow engineers that appear to be out producing me by a wide margin, but most of that is the weekly if not daily need to fix their code that has been so Frankensteined from years of new and forgotten and no longer needed edge cases they have a mini existential crisis whenever they actually have to dive deeper than surface level of their own creations. Meanwhile my code sits under hundreds to thousands of daily critical automation processes for years, unseen, only needing to be touched when a new feature is needed, and then they slip back into the darkness forgotten again.   \n  \nMean while management scoffs or just handwaves any talk of any kind of style guidelines, use of any kind of shared code repositories, naming conventions, etc.   \n  \nI was pulled out of my comfortable obscurity probably 9 months ago to rewrite a daily reminder app across the corporation (I work for a global company from Australia to India, to the US, to the UK and other nations) to enter time for the day. The current app is so clearly late 90's design everything is some kind of color gradient with excessive drop shadow, 15 different colors for hover, click, unclick, disabled, ... rounded corners galore, and planted firmly in the Windows OS on maybe .NET 3.5 era drag and drop WinForms. Under the hood things were kept updated through the end of the now antiquated .NET Framework along with the massively bloated libraries of which less than 5% was actually used. Just about everything in the app was hand rolled from its scheduling to its notification UI.\n\n  \nFor months we asked what we call our \"User Experience Team\" for a design and got nothing. Finally my management just said here are the requirements\n\n* Has to have the same basic functionality as the original\n* Should run cross platform, and cross device\n* Should be as accessible as possible for all the potential users of a global company\n\nSo over the course of 3 months I worked at not just writing the new app but in most cases having to learn entirely new API while using them for the first time, and having to do it on 3 or 4 different operating system ecosystems. Plus having to update my 10 year old knowledge of C# up to the current .NET Core, as well as the insane changes to the tooling in Visual Studio since the last time I developed something for production. The fact I have lived in the terminal for so long definitely made the jump back to UI a jarring one, probably spent more time fighting to understand new tooling than actually writing code.\n\nIn the end I had an app that had \n\n* full localization with over 80 supported languages (the current app has hard coded English text)\n* accessibility all the way up to screen readers in Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS \n* native OS specific support and use of\n   * Themes (Dark/Light)\n   * Notifications\n* clean minimalistic modern design\n   * black and white with pops of color for attention\n* JSON settings (the current app still uses INI files)\n* tiny UX QoL additions\n   * choosing screen position of settings screen\n   * saving user preferences \n\nThen finally we got a response from the UET and they wanted to change just about everything. I had been warned to be fair about their extreme views on how things are supposed to look from a corporate perspective and I've dealt with plenty of that before. I had already pulled the SVG files of our corporate logo from the official media resource site to be prepared. All of my past experiences seemed like walks in the park compared to this.\n\nFirst they came back with a UI design up to its eyeballs in late 90's UI design they had a 45 page PowerPoint outlining every color for buttons, shadows, outlines, etc. Half of which were just impossible to do with the cross platform limitations of the native OS notification APIs, and UI elements. \n\nThat launched us into almost 4 months of fighting with them that we want to leverage the same native OS Notification system that just about every other enterprise app from Teams to Crowdstrike, to Intune, to Email uses instead of hand rolling not just the notification UI but the entire underlying system to schedule and display said notification. Both to alleviate us of the burden of maintaining that and to condition our users to expect their notifications from any apps in the future in the same place.\n\nJust on the windows size we went through\n\n* we want bigger button icons\n   * they are fixed at 16 x 16\n* we want incredibly detailed button icons\n   * again fixed 16 x 16 pixels\n* We want text under the buttons\n   * Despite the icons being incredibly well recognized ones like \n      * a simplified globe for a website\n      * a X to dismiss\n      * a Gear for settings\n   * despite the fact the buttons ALL had tooltips\n      * And tooltips tied into the screen reader function\n\nSo many times we'd have hour long meetings where I would outline in detail that these notification systems are deliberately simplistic and what our boundaries were and they'd send me a new design which would ignore 80% of what I said.\n\n  \nMeanwhile my direct manager started making me do things like spend weeks designing our own notification UI \"just in case they won't let us use the OS level notifications\".  or just outright abandoning things in the app because they \"just wanted to get this done\"\n\n  \nI really should have clued in earlier than I did. I lost track of the number of times my own manger would just casually throw out well why don't we drop the localization if this is going to be a problem, Reminder we are a global company that supposedly prides itself in our diverse work force and what to me should be non negotiables in that case (localization and accessibility) are just an impatient impulse away from being scrapped.\n\n  \nI had to compromise on the text on the buttons loosing some of the accessibility with the screen readers (sorry to the visually impaired) and sorry to the more verbose languages which caused uncontrollable text wrapping within the width limits of the buttons (Which was not an issue with the tool tips) but in the end I was able to get them to accept the benefits of leveraging the native notifications.\n\n  \nThen we moved on to the settings app and I was told multiple times by my manager \"I don't know why you are fighting so hard for things in this you already got them to agree to use the native notifications that should be good enough.\" Meanwhile I'm trying to explain to a bunch of glorified graphic designers how everything from their browsers to things like Word and Paint all use mainly icons with tool tips so differences in string lengths of different languages don't drastically change the layout and that our settings app should be the same simple \"icons\" from SVG data that could be colored easily for theme switching and maintain a simple consistent look and size regardless of the users native language.\n\n  \nWe went through a huge back and forth on the screen position tool on how it looks, we had pretty much settled on some changes and were having a little back and forth on some of the color choices when my manager pulls me in to a chat that Friday and basically tells me well maybe we think about dropping that feature since they are fighting over it. I tell him we've pretty much reached a consensus. So he tells me ok you and I will talk about it on Monday before the meeting.\n\n  \nNot 5 minutes later he posts in the group chat with the UET \"If you want we can just get right of the screen position tool.\" and almost immediately they were like \"ok so here's a new UI design since you are offering\" Clearly they had it waiting in the wings. The best part besides being thrown under the bus by my manager was their new design was another radical layout change from the previous layout we had painstakingly agreed on all leading up to them wanting this to be displayed in a looming corporate wide event. So now I'm stuck with even more UI design change and code that already looks like Swiss cheese because they can't even stay consistent in what they want it to look like or behave like.\n\n  \nAfter pointing out to the group chat that trying to hit these constantly moving and arbitrary changes was exhausting my manager scheduled a one on one with me and his manager where I was told \"You have to stop taking this so personally\" I tried to explain to them that insisting on basic features like supporting our end users native languages, our end users disabilities, and opting for the vanilla flavored APIs whenever possible is not taking it personal but the bare minimum I should be shooting for when designing software for a company that touts the kind of mission statement most do. That was met with a bunch of hand wavy \"Well you just don't know all the stuff that goes into maintaining a corporate image and things like that.\" \n\n I told my manager point blank that he stabbed me in the back. You always know the feel good stuff most companies put in their mission statements or creeds are BS but I've never experienced just how expendable they really are than in this project. Trying to square the circle of my manager for 15 minutes telling how they worked with this one guy who had a visual impairment that he could not see black and white and being told a dozen or more times to scorch the ability of 10's of thousands of employees to have the app in their language or read to them all to placate a group obsessed with design over function.\n\nSo that brings us to right now where I'm wrapping up the latest round of almost complete UI rework hoping this time its enough for me to be done with this. I don't quit when I've set off to create something but this has shattered something inside. I'm no stranger to throwing things out. I love an elegant solution but will be the first to throw it out when a proven superior one comes along. Usually I can find immense joy in just the process of learning new things and the challenges with designing something robust and useable for as wide an audience as possible despite the input from other less technical stake holders. Something about spending so long being dictated by a group of people that not only are 25 years out of date with their idea of UI design but actively ignores any knowledge of modern UI design, while my management is just trying to shove things through with about as much foresight as a frat party hookup has me so frustrated I'm starting to hate the idea of coding for work. \n\nI jump to some of my backend stuff and I'm back in that joy state, pop the hood on a tool my co worker discovered a feature need to both update and take the opportunity to teach him somethings about designing resilient tools and I'm all into that joy and elation. I work on something with my son on one of the Arduino projects and I'm feeling the joy especially watching him get excited when he makes something happen. I come back to THIS project and it's all I can do to force myself to slog through yet another massive change while I'm being hounded to hurry up.\n\nI do hope when I'm finally done with this project I can slip back into the shadows and get back to my only work love: the code. Though now when my manager asks me things like how my weekend was all I can think is why are you even asking me? or how my family is and all I can do is choke down what I really want to say and respond with a \"yes, what can I do for you.\" \n\nI know a lot of this is my fault I have the bad habit of getting comfortable and let a lot of things slide on an interpersonal side when I'm working on something I love, I have never had a problem being professional and working with people that I do not personally get a long with, but I can't just put the knowledge you actively tried to sabotage me away because you want me to believe you care with your platitudes.\n\nIf it wasn't for the fact this job was helping me pay for my children's school tuition I would most likely be less stressed to kowtow to people who don't value what I do. \n\n\n\nI'm seriously considering taking my mornings before this job and taking a volunteer position teaching the high schoolers at my kids private school some programming courses. They are have been some subtle and not so subtle requests from some of the staff and teachers for me to maybe jump in. I have always loved teaching others and I have in the corporate world a really good track record of teach people that went on to high level jobs from the skills I was able to foster in them. Maybe the joy of seeing the lights go on and the excitement of creation in the faces of tomorrows potential engineers and developers will be enough to keep the spark alive in the darkness of all I'm paid to endure.
