Other than python, most of them (except for one exceptionally bad candidate) could talk the talk regarding tech stack, ELT vs ETL, tools like dbt, Glue, SQL Server, etc. but not a single one could actually write python.\n\nWhat's even more insane to me is that ALL of them rated themselves somewhere between 5-8 (yes, the most recent one said he's an 8) in their python skills. Then when we get to the live coding portion of the session, they literally cannot write a single line. I understand live coding is intimidating, but my goodness, surely you can write just ONE coherent line of code at an 8/10 skill level. I just do not understand why they are doing this - do they really think we're not gonna ask them to prove it when they rate themselves that highly?\n\nWhat is going on here??\n\n  \nedit: Alright I stand corrected - I guess a lot of yall don't use python for DE work.

        "content": "I keep seeing this idea repeated here:\n\n> **‚ÄúThe entire point of a bronze layer is to have raw data with no or minimal transformations.‚Äù**\n\nI get the intent ‚Äî but I have multiple data sources (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.), where each object already comes with a well-defined schema. In my ETL pipeline, I use an automated schema validator: if someone changes the source data, the pipeline automatically detects the change and adjusts accordingly.\n\nFor example, the Product object might have 300 fields, but only 220 are actually used in practice. So why ingest all 300 if my schema validator already confirms which fields are relevant?\n\nPeople often respond with:\n\n>> **‚ÄúStandard practice is to bring all columns through to Bronze and only filter in Silver. That way, if you need a column later, it‚Äôs already there.‚Äù**\n\nBut if schema evolution is automated across all layers, then I‚Äôm not managing multiple schema definitions ‚Äî they evolve together. And I‚Äôm not even bringing storage or query cost into the argument; I just find this approach cleaner and more efficient.\n\nAlso, side note: why does almost every post here involve vendor recommendations? It‚Äôs hard to believe everyone here is working at a large-scale data company with billions of events per day. I often see beginner-level questions, and the replies immediately mention tools like Airbyte or Fivetran. Sometimes, writing a few lines of Python is faster, cheaper, and gives you full control. Isn‚Äôt that what engineers are supposed to do?\n\nCurious to hear from others doing things manually or with lightweight infrastructure ‚Äî is skipping unused fields in Bronze really a bad idea if your schema evolution is fully automated?",

Right now I believe that I've never been so productive because I actually see my deliverables as something \"solid\", something that no pretencious \"business guy\" will try to debate or outsmart me (with his 5min GPT research).\n\nUsually most of my DS routine envolved trying to convince the \"business guy\" that asked for me to deliver something, that my solutions was indeed correct despite of his opinion on that matter. Now I've found myself with tasks that is moving data from A to B, and once it's done theres no debate whether it is true or not, and I can feel myself relieved. \n\nPerhaps what I see in the future that could also give me a relatable feeling of \"solidity\" is MLE/MLOps. \n\nThis is just a shout out for those that are also tired, perhaps give it a chance for DE and try to see if it brings a piece of mind for you.

It‚Äôs a lot, likely because the interface wasn‚Äôt intended for this purpose. It‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got though. It‚Äôs slow with lots of steps to potentially fail at. All that, and I can only filter at a days granularity‚Äîso polling for changes is a loaded process too.\n\nI went ahead and set up an ETL pipeline that used DuckDB as an intermediate caching layer, to avoid memory issues, and set it up to dump parquet into S3. This ran for 24 hours then failed just shy of the dump, so now I‚Äôm thinking about micro batches.\n\nI want to turn this into a microbatch process. I figure I can cache the ID, HATEAOS link, and a nullable column for the JSON data. Once I have the data, I update the row where it belongs. I could store duckdb in S3 the whole time, or just plan to dump it if a failure occurs. This also gives a way to query the duckdb for missing records in case it fails mid way.\n\nSo before I dump duckdb into S3, or even try to use duckdb in s3 over a network, are there limitations I‚Äôm not considering?

I assume goal is to prevent writing each row every time, but to buffer it for bulk of rows to ingest. \n\nDoes my thought process make sense? How is this done in practice? Do i just say to SparkStreaming write to OLAP each 10 minutes as micro batches? Does this architecture make sense?",

        "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm tasked with grabbing data from one db about devices and using a rest api to pull information associated with it. The problem is that the api only allows inputting a single device at a time and I have 20k+ rows in the db table. The plan is to automate this using airflow as a daily job (probably 20-100 new rows per day). What would be the best way of doing this? For now I was going to resort to a for-loop but this doesn‚Äôt seem the most efficient.\n\nAdditionally, the api returns information about the device, and a list of sub devices that are children to the main device. The number of children is arbitrary, but they all have the same fields: the parent and children. I want to capture all the fields for each parent and child, so I was thinking of have a table in long format with an additional column called parent_id, which allows the children records to be self joined on their parent record. \n\n\nNote: each api call is around 500ms average, and no I cannot just join the table with the underlying api data source directly\n\nDoes my current approach seem valid? I am eager to learn if there are any tools that would work great in my situation or if there are any glaring flaws.\n\nThanks!\n",

What is the best practice for large healthcare data migration.

We have several tables in each database. I'm trying to understand if there's a way to make this process streamlined.\n\n3) How technical does it get from being a Data Analyst to a Data Engineer? I use a lot of DML SQL for reporting and ETL into Tableau. \n\n4) Finally, is this a good career change keeping in mind the whole AI transition? I have five years experience as a data analyst.\n\n  \nYour responses are greatly appreciated.",

        "content": "Hello! I would like to introduce a lightweight way to add **end-to-end data validation** into data pipelines: using Python + YAML, no extra infra, no heavy UI.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è **(Disclosure: I work at Soda, the team behind Soda Core, which is open source)**\n\n**The idea is simple:**\n\nAdd quick, declarative checks at key pipeline points to validate things like row counts, nulls, freshness, duplicates, and column values. To achieve this, you need a library called Soda Core. It‚Äôs open source and uses a YAML-based language (SodaCL) to express expectations.\n\n**A simple workflow:**\n\nIngestion ‚Üí ‚úÖ pre-checks ‚Üí Transformation ‚Üí ‚úÖ post-checks\n\n**How to write validation checks:**\n\nThese checks are written in YAML. Very human-readable. Example:\n\n    # Checks for basic validations\n    checks for dim_customer:\n      - row_count between 10 and 1000\n      - missing_count(birth_date) = 0\n      - invalid_percent(phone) < 1 %:\n          valid format: phone number\n\n**Use Airflow as an example:**\n\n1. Installing Soda Core Python library\n2. Writing two YAML files (`configuration.yml` to configure your data source, `checks.yml` for expectations)\n3. Calling the Soda Scan (extra scan.py) via Python inside your DAG\n\n**If folks are interested, I‚Äôm happy to share:**\n\n* A step-by-step guide for other data pipeline use cases\n* Tips on writing metrics\n* How to share results with non-technical users using the UI\n* DM me, or schedule a quick meeting with me.\n\nLet me know if you're doing something similar or want to try this pattern.",

We currently have a use case where we need to seek distinct values for some fields in thousands of files, which is quite slow when done directly on S3.\n\nMy manager and I were experimenting with Parquet files to achieve this. but I recently found out that Parquet files are immutable, so we can't update existing parquet files with new listings unless we load the whole file into memory. \n\n  \nEach listingId file is quite small (few Kbs), so it doesn't make sense for one parquet file to only contain info about a single listingId. \n\nI wanted to ask if someone has accomplished something like this before.

Snowflake provides nice UIs to populate this metadata DIRECTLY INTO Snowflake, but when dbt drops and re-creates a table as part of a nightly build,  the metadata that was entered directly into Snowflake is lost.  Therefore, we are instead entering our metadata into dbt YAML files (a macro  propagates the dbt metadata to Snowflake metadata).   However, there are no UI options available (other than spreadsheets) for entering metadata into dbt which means data engineers will have to be directly involved which won't scale.  What can we do?  Does dbt cloud ($$) provide a way to keep dbt metadata and Snowflake-entered metadata in sync BOTH WAYS through object recreations?  ",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\n**Context:**\n\nI am currently creating an ETL pipeline. The pipeline ingests rock climbing data (which was webscraped) transforms it and cleans it. Another pipeline extracts hourly 7 day weather forecast data and cleans it. \n\nThe plan is to match crags (rock climbing sites) with weather forecasts using the coordinate variables of both datasets. That way, a rock climber can look at his favourite crag and see if the weather is right for climbing in the next seven days (correct temperature, not raining etc.) and plan their trips accordingly. The weather data would update everyday.\n\nTo be clear, there won't be any front end for this project. I am just creating an ETL pipeline **as if** this was going to be the use case for the database. I plan on using the project to try to persuade the Senior Data Engineer at my current company to give me some real DE work.\n\n**Problem**\n\nThis is the schema I have landed on for now. The weather data is normalised to only one level while the crag data being normalised into multiple levels. \n\nI think the weather data is quite simple is easy. It's just the crag data I am worried about. There are over 127,000 rows here with lots of columns that have many 1 to many relationships. I think not normalising would be a mistake and create performance issues, but again, it's my first time normalising to such an extent. I have created a star schema database but this is the first time normalising past 1 level. I just wanted to make sure everything was correctly done before I go ahead with creating the database\n\n  \n\n\n[Schema for now](https://preview.redd.it/q4x72hcicq0f1.png?width=2501&format=png&auto=webp&s=b69f68a2b52d63aa5ce42a36a6330873ab371ed2)\n\n**The relationship is as follows:**\n\ncrag --> sector (optional) --> route\n\ncrags are a singular site of climbing. They have a longitude and latitude coordinate associated with them as well as a name. Each crag has many routes on it. Typically, a single crag has one rocktype (e.g. sandstone, gravel etc.) associated with it but can have many different types of climbs (e.g. lead climbing, bouldering, trad climbing)\n\nIf a crag is particularly large it will have multiple sectors, each sector will have many routes. and each sector has a name associated with them. Smaller crags will have only have one sector, called: 'Main Sector'.\n\nRoutes are the most granular datapoint. Each route has a name, a difficulty grade, a safety grade and a type.\n\nI hope this explains everything well.  Any advice would be appreciated ",

        "content": "We‚Äôre thrilled to share a selection of the latest enhancements to the Airbyte Platform. From native support for loading data into Apache Iceberg‚Äìcompatible data lakes and AI Assistants that proactively monitor connection health, to expanded advanced APIs in the Connector Builder, we continue to double down on empowering data engineering teams with the best modern open data movement solution. In a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jramqt/airbyte_connector_builder_now_supports_graphql/), I covered Connector Builder updates like async streams, nested compressed files, and GraphQL support. Below is a highlight of some of the newest features we‚Äôve added.\n\n# Consolidate Data to Iceberg-Compatible Data Lakes\n\nIceberg has quickly become a standard for building modern data platforms ready for providing AI-ready data to your teams. Our [Iceberg-compatible Data Lake destination](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/s3-data-lake) is catalog and storage agnostic, and designed for highly scalable and performant AI and analytics workloads. With schema evolution support, along with expanded capabilities to move unstructured data and structured records all in one pipeline, you can use Airbyte to consolidate on Iceberg with confidence knowing your data is AI ready. And, with [Mappings](https://airbyte.com/blog/load-compliant-data-with-airbyte-mappers), you can share corporate data with confidence, knowing sensitive data will not be leaked.\n\nFor a deep dive for data engineers on the benefits of adopting the Iceberg standard for storing both raw and processed data, and an outline of the capabilities of Airbyte's Data Lake destinations, or check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8krPElimfM).\n\n# Operate Hundreds of Pipelines in One Place\n\nAs the number of pipelines you need to manage with Airbyte grows, the need to oversee, monitor and manage your data pipelines in one place is critical for maintaining high data quality and data freshness. With this in mind, we're excited to introduce four new capabilities enabling you to better manage hundreds of pipelines all in one place:\n\n**Diagnose sync errors with AI**\n\nWe‚Äôve expanded AI support in Cloud Team to allow you to quickly diagnose and fix failed data pipeline syncs  Instantly analyze Airbyte logs, connector documentation and known issues to help you identify root cause, and get actionable solutions, without any manual debugging required. Read more [here](https://airbyte.com/blog/diagnose-data-pipeline-sync-errors-with-ai).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6v1cfu63t0f1.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb94a2439bf7747d0107c107936f6bdfc3fe3935\n\n**Monitor connection health from Connections page**\n\n[Monitor the health of all your connections](https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/cloud/managing-airbyte-cloud/review-connection-status) directly from within the Connections page using the new Connections Dashboard. This helps you quickly track down intermittent failures, and easily drill in for more information to help you resolve sync or performance issues.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w79dsro83t0f1.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=4707858cd6cc36d7481d38ee515f81e6599bbac6\n\n**Organize pipelines with connection tags**\n\nConnection Tags help to visually group and organize your pipelines, making it easier than ever to find the connections you need. You can use tags to organize connections based on any set of criteria you like: 'department' in the case of different consuming teams, 'env' for indicating if they are running in production, and anything else you like.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12lnnj3a3t0f1.png?width=2836&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8dfbbbebbc4a9776d5b1b650172094cf138da93\n\n**Identify schema changes in the Connection timeline**\n\nThe [Connection timeline now includes events for any connection settings update](https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/cloud/managing-airbyte-cloud/review-connection-timeline): whether these be a schedule update, or a change in the connection schema. For Cloud Teams users, you can use this in conjunction with AI logging to easily  diagnose why sync behavior or volumes have suddenly changed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4oqcbgb3t0f1.png?width=2746&format=png&auto=webp&s=248babfb9b142aad7a5a88fc6bd2bf555d750b61\n\n# Manage Connectors as Infrastructure with Airbyte's Terraform Provider\n\nData movement is an integral part of your application and infrastructure. We've heard plenty of feedback from users requesting better ease of use for our Terraform Provider. We are excited to announce new capabilities making it easier than ever to manage all of your connectors using the Airbyte Terraform provider to roll out changes programmatically to your dev, staging, and production environments.\n\nWhen building a connector in the Airbyte UI, you will now find a **Copy JSON** button at the bottom of connector configuration. You can quickly use this to export the the configuration of a connector to Terraform. This takes into account version-specific configuration settings, and can also be repurposed for configuring connectors with PyAirbyte, the Python SDK or the Airbyte API.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eib6twxc3t0f1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c4902d63dbc6a47f22f7f1cf10ba387f0f6474d\n\n# Create custom connectors directly from YAML or Docker images\n\n[New endpoints and resources have also been added](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/v-1.6#create-custom-connectors-from-yaml-or-docker-images-using-the-api-and-terraform) to the APIs and Terraform provider to allow you create and update custom connectors using a Connection Builder YAML manifest or Docker image.  These endpoints do not allow you to modify Airbyte‚Äôs public connector configurations, but if you have custom endpoints within your organization and are running OSS or self-managed versions of Airbyte, these additional capabilities can be used to programmatically spin up new connectors for different environments.\n\nIf you need to manage API custom connectors in infrastructure, we now recommend you build your custom connector using the Connector Builder, test it using the in-app capability for verifying your connector, then export the configuration YAML. You can then easily pass in the YAML as part of a connector resource definition in Terraform:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5loabk9e3t0f1.png?width=3036&format=png&auto=webp&s=d732b93ad24c43e79a3c3f70766135b23bbf7488\n\nTogether, these two changes will make it significantly easier to manage your entire catalog of connectors as infrastructure in code, if this is preference for you and your team. You can read more detailed information on all features available in our [release note page](https://docs.airbyte.com/release_notes/).",

        "content": "I have quite a complex SQL query within DBT which I have been tasked to build an API 'on top of'.\n\nMore specifically, I want to create an API that allows users to send input data (e.g., JSON with column values), and under the hood, it runs my dbt model using that input and returns the transformed output as defined by the model.\n\nFor example, suppose I have a dbt model called `my_model` (in reality the model is a lot more complex):\n\n    select \n        {{ macro_1(\"col_1\") }} as out_col_1,\n        {{ macro_2(\"col_1\", \"col_2\") }} as out_col_2\n    from \n        {{ ref('input_model_or_data') }}\n    \n\nNormally, `ref('input_model_or_data')` would resolve to another dbt model, but I‚Äôve seen in dbt unit tests that you can inject synthetic data into that `ref()`, like this:\n\n    - name: test_my_model\n      model: my_model\n      given:\n        - input: ref('input_model_or_data')\n          rows:\n            - {col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1}\n      expect:\n        rows:\n          - {out_col_1: \"out_val_1\", out_col_2: \"out_val_2\"}\n    \n\nThis allows the test to override the input source. I‚Äôd like to do something similar via an API: the user sends input like `{col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1}` to an endpoint, and the API returns the output of the dbt model (e.g., `{out_col_1: \"out_val_1\", out_col_2: \"out_val_2\"}`), having used that input as the data behind `ref('input_model_or_data')`.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the recommended way to do something like this?",

        "content": "Hi,\n\nI've been chatting with a bunch of beginners from this sub over the past couple months (like 12 of you lol), and thought I'd dump some thoughts on what actually matters when ur starting out. Not gonna pretend I know everything - I'm only mid-senior myself, but here's what I've picked up from both sides of the fence.\n\n**Stop obsessing about languages**\n\nEveryone's like \"which language should I learn???\" and tbh it doesn't matter that much. Just pick one that seems cool and focus on getting comfortable with the basics - functions, loops, etc until you don't have to think about syntax. Then grab a web framework for whatever langauge you picked and build some actual stuff.  \nJS is probably the easiest recommendation since it works in browsers, handles JSON without extra headaches, and you can make UIs right away. I personally like TypeScript these days cuz it catches my dumb mistakes, but I started with Python. My team at work uses Go for backend stuff and I'm still learning it lol. Languages are just tools.\n\n**What companies acutally look for**\n\nI've been on both sides of interviews and helped with hiring at my last company. Gonna be real - the worst junior devs aren't the ones who don't know stuff, its the ones who don't improve fast enough.  \nYour starting point matters way less than how quick you pick things up. What I care about when interviewing juniors isn't what you know right now - it's how fast you'll become usful and how much babysitting you're gonna need. Being able to read documentation and understand existing code is honestly MORE valuable than writing it perfectly from scratch.  \nOne of the best devs I know beat me at Chess after only reading about strategy for a few days. Same energy - they can just absorb new info super quick.\n\n**Portfolio stuff - simpler than you think**\n\nOne legit project that YOU built (not copy/pasting a tutorial) beats a dozen generic portfolio projects. I need someone who can solve problems when stuff breaks, and personal projects show me you've actually dug yourself out of holes.  \nIf you're stuck on what to build - thats kinda a warning sign tbh. You should want to build SOMETHING. Clone spotify. Make a task app that doesn't suck. Build that game idea. What did you think would be cool before you realized coding is hard af?  \nAs for how big the project should be - there's no magic answer. You should feel like you've made something that works, or that you're proud of parts of your code, or that you've fixed enough annoying bugs that you've learned some real lessons.\n\n**Find ppl who get it**\n\nYou need someone who'll help keep you going, but they can't push you - that's on you. A decent mentor answers questions and helps when you're stuck, but YOU gotta stay motivated til things click.  \nStack overflow and reddit are fine but sometimes u need someone who gets YOUR specific confusion. Don't be afraid to ask stuff that seems stupid - I asked sooo many dumb questions when I started (and still do in our team slack lol). Learning to code is legit painful, but it does get better!  \nI was stunned when i started mentoring how many questions are so context-specific that googling just doesn't help. Like sometimes you just need a human to explain something in YOUR terms.\n\n**Just. Pick. Something**\n\n\"People keep saying mixed things about X\" is something I hear ALL the time. But mixed reviews just mean nothing is perfect - welcome to programming lol. Try like 2-3 options for a day each and then just commit to one. Don't feel like you have to finish every udemy course - I've prob completed like 3 out of the 20 I've bought because I usually get what I need halfway thru.  \nEvery \"wrong\" choice actually makes you better in the long run. I started with Django bcuz I thought I wanted to be a python dev, then moved to Node, then React, and now I'm doing Go microservices. None of it was wasted time.  \nAlso don't worry about frameworks changing or whatever. Once you know one, picking up others is 10x easier.\n\n**The secret sauce**\n\nConsistency > motivation. Make a habit of coding everyday, even if its just 30 min. Some days you'll hate it. Some days you'll love it. But your brain needs the repetition to build those neural pathways.  \nI still have days when I feel like an absolute fraud and other days when I'm like \"damn I'm good at this\". It's normal.  \nHit me up if u got questions. Not guaranteeing I'll answer but I'll try if I have time.\n\nEdit 1: Wow, I did not know all these people would be interested! I've created a new community for a follow-up series where I'll share more coding journey insights: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CodeGrind/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CodeGrind/)\n\nThanks",

Is it something anyone can pick up, or does your brain have to work in a specific way?\n\nI‚Äôve looked at the FAQ and done some research already, but I really want to hear your honest experience with programming and how accessible it is.\n \nThanks all :)\n\n\nEdit: Wow!!! Thank you so so much for the replies everyone. I am at work but I‚Äôm going to read through and respond later today. I didn‚Äôt expect nearly this much support, I appreciate you all.\n\nJust to add some more information- I have no experience yet. I just started taking a free online course and playing with scratch literally yesterday. I‚Äôve always loved games but until now have been focusing on improving my creative abilities (art and writing) so that I can create a decent game, and now I think I‚Äôm finally at a good spot with that so I‚Äôm moving to the next step (programming). \n\nI am a very good reader, and can be good at problem solving, but I have fairly severe ADHD which makes it hard to keep track of things. I think it will be challenging, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm passionate about so I‚Äôm willing to put in the effort. Thank you all so much!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you so much everybody. I couldn‚Äôt respond to everyone without sounding repetitive, but I read through every comment and am so grateful to you all for taking the time to give me your opinions and advice. I think I may struggle in some areas more than others might, but I am so determined and excited to make this happen. You‚Äôre all amazing!! I appreciate you so much",

I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences!\n* What apps, websites, or learning platforms do you recommend for someone in my position?\n\nI‚Äôm committed and ready to put in the effort ‚Äî just need to figure out the best approach.\n\nThanks so much!",

I thought it would be a cool way to explore string matching and character encoding in Python ‚Äî and I'd love to get your thoughts or improvements!\n\n## How the cipher works:\n- Each character is converted to its ASCII value.\n- That number (as a string) is searched for in the digits of œÄ (ignoring the decimal point).\n- The **starting index** of the first match and the **length** of the match are recorded.\n- Each character is encoded as `index-length`, separated by hyphens.\n\n### Example:\nThe ASCII value of `'A'` is `65`.  \nIf `65` first appears in œÄ at index **7** (œÄ = 3.141592653... ‚Üí digits = 141592653...),  \nthen it's encoded as:\n```\n7-2\n```\n---\n\n## Here‚Äôs an encrypted message:\n```\n11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2\n```\n---\n\n## And here‚Äôs the Python code to decode it:\n```python\nfrom mpmath import mp\n\nmp.dps = 100005  # digits of œÄ\npi_digits = str(mp.pi)[2:]\n\ncipher_text = (\n    \"11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-174-3-153-3-395-3-15-2-1011-3-94-3-921-3-395-3-15-2-921-3-153-3-2534-3-445-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-12-2-15-2-44-2-49-3-709-3-269-3-852-3-2724-3-19-2-15-2-11-2-153-3-94-3-16867-4-2724-3-852-3-15-2-709-3-852-3-852-3-2724-3-49-3-174-3-3486-3-15-2-49-3-174-3-395-3-153-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-2534-3-153-3-3486-3-49-3-44-2-15-2-153-3-163-3-15-2-395-3-269-3-852-3-15-2-153-3-174-3-852-3-15-2-494-3-269-3-153-3-15-2-80-2-94-3-49-3-2534-3-395-3-15-2-49-3-395-3-19-2-15-2-39-2-153-3-153-3-854-3-15-2-2534-3-94-3-44-2-1487-3-19-2\"\n)\n\nsegments = cipher_text.strip().split(\"-\")\nindex_length_pairs = [\n    (int(segments[i]), int(segments[i + 1]))\n    for i in range(0, len(segments), 2)\n]\n\ndecoded_chars = []\nfor index, length in index_length_pairs:\n    ascii_digits = pi_digits[index - 1 : index - 1 + length]\n    decoded_chars.append(chr(int(ascii_digits)))\n\ndecoded_message = \"\".join(decoded_chars)\nprint(decoded_message)\n```\n---\n\n### Tutorial Flair\n\nThis post demonstrates how to decode a custom cipher based on the digits of œÄ.  \nIt walks through reading the encoded index-length pairs, mapping them to ASCII values found in the digits of œÄ, and reconstructing the original message using Python.\n\nFeel free to adapt the script to experiment with your own messages or tweak the ciphering method.

If you know any typed language it is super quick to pick up, and if it's your first typed language you'll need a bit more time to get it but once you do you're not going back to vanilla JS. \n\nEveryone's journey is different, but if you feel you dig yourself in too easily when dealing with passing data around, try it!",

Yes I said drag and drop.\n\nMost people would just put on YouTube on headphones and like zombies drag and drop all day. (Wish I was making this up). These resources were used to help students in exam preparation. \n\nIn the folders there where hundreds of different PDFs, PowerPoints, MCQ questions as well as thousands of csv files.\n\nShe was in a perpetually panic to do this for unclear reasons. I guess they powered her website and her entire business.\n\nAt the time I had no programming knowledge yet instinctively knew it could be done better. In my total ignorance I tried some some scripts in Javascript until she caught me and yelled at me to do my real job. Later I was let go for not being productive enough.\n\nI asked some nearby devs for help but they said they were too busy.\n\nToday I know an intern could have a Python script doing the main stuff inside a day with os.system, glob, a few for loops, csv libraries etc, pandas. Stick a chron job and it‚Äôs daily routine. \n\nEven better use Powershell / awk, see or grep.\n\nBetter yet move everything to the cloud.\n\nThe entire process could have automated inside a month when all edge cases where accounted for. \n\nThere were some devs on front end but I think they hated her so much they didn‚Äôt intervene or didn‚Äôt get paid enough to care. They all left very rapidly I don‚Äôt blame them for claiming ignorance. The owner / founder was a psychotic bint.\n\nOne time, a dev got validly angry about something unrelated about a development process and suddenly next week he was gone for \"operational reasons\".\n\nShe paid 10-15 people minimum wage to do this drag and dropping for 2-3 years to best of my knowledge. \n\nThey are somehow still in business.\nIt‚Äôs unbelievable how incompetent it was but that‚Äôs truth.",

I‚Äôd love some outside perspective.\n\nWhen I started, I was trained in the company's main stack ‚Äì NestJS (Node) and React ‚Äì and I was excited to grow in that tech. But for the past few months, I‚Äôve been doing tasks that have almost nothing to do with fullstack development:\n\n* Creating automations in low-code tools\n* Researching integrations with outdated platforms\n* Working in an 8-year-old PHP project (I had zero experience in PHP before)\n\nTo make it worse, the PHP project has no proper security practices (e.g., passwords stored in plaintext in the database), and my suggestions for refactoring or rewriting it in our actual stack have been ignored.\n\nI'm currently split across 3 different projects and constantly bombarded with tasks from all sides. Meetings eat up a lot of time, and I‚Äôm falling behind. There‚Äôs barely any code review or mentorship, and I feel like I‚Äôm not learning or growing in the direction I want.\n\nOn top of all that, I‚Äôm working for minimum wage in my country, which makes it even more discouraging -I‚Äôm putting in real effort but I feel like I‚Äôm getting very little in return, both in terms of compensation and career growth.\n\nI do have a backup plan (a non-IT job I could return to), but I‚Äôm hesitant to give up on development just yet. That said, the junior job market is rough, and I‚Äôm worried that if I leave now, I might end up searching for months before I find another dev position.\n\nSo I'm stuck in this limbo ‚Äî should I just accept that this is how things are in smaller companies and try to push through? Or is this a sign that I should look for a better environment?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice from those who‚Äôve been through something similar. Thanks in advance!",

Its really cool. I've been using Vimium C on firefox and i have really enjoyed it. That has made me install Neovim. I got halfway thought the tutor because i havent had much time recently.\n\nMy question is: Why would you want to use Vim and other terminal based editors (which might not be IDEs out of the box) when you could use something like Visual Studio (which is very popular) with something that lets you use vim motions, commands, macros and all of that good stuff that Vim has?  \nI'm sure that you can make your editor of choice work only with a keyboard, and customize it to your needs. Why use something like Vim then?",

So I think that coding enables me to satisfy that curiosity \n\n2. I‚Äôm drawn to the kind of routine a programmer can have.; I like spending time in front of a computer, I like office work, remote work; I especially appreciate the flexibility that tech jobs often provide\n\n3. Although it can be hard to handle frustration, I like being challenged by a problem\n\n4. Another important reason is the financial stability that programming can offer.\n\n5. I genuinely enjoy coding\n\nI have been learning Python for 4 months; I am very interested in data science, data analysis, machine learning and back-end development. I am not sure if these reasons alone are enough to guaranteed success, but I am determined to make happen ",

I rediscovered my love for programming after taking a bare-bones robotics class that just so happened to allow programming in Python. Since that ended, I've been trying to get back into the practice as a hobby only to discover I am bored out of my goddamn mind. I've been trying to learn to make little games, but even trying to recreate Pong in Lua makes my eyes glaze over less than 50 lines in. I can't look at an empty shell without getting a pit in my stomach. I like to look at source code to see what makes games tick, and it always feels like I'm learning something, but I always get that same numb feeling if I ever do anything beyond very simple tasks. Anything a more perceptive programmer would be able to see just seeps right through me. The last \"big\" project I ever completed generated bingo boards from a template with random numbers for a friend's project. It felt good to have a problem and slowly figure out how to solve it, and it was the most fun I've had programming in years. How do I get that feeling of euphoria again?

        "author": "JuggernautOk681",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI‚Äôve tried learning coding through online courses and YouTube videos earlier, but honestly, I always felt something was missing. Most of the time, I ended up just following what was shown, without actually understanding *why* we were doing something a certain way. The basics never felt clear, and I was always left with questions like ‚Äúwhy exactly is this done like this?‚Äù\n\nSo now, I‚Äôve decided to start fresh ‚Äî this time with a proper focus on understanding things deeply, step by step. My main preference is to **read books or documentation** rather than watching videos. I feel like books allow me to go at my own pace, re-read things, and properly think about what I‚Äôm learning. I‚Äôve also heard from others that books usually explain things in more detail and depth compared to many tutorials.\n\nHere‚Äôs how I‚Äôm planning to approach it:\n\n1. First, I want to learn **general programming concepts** ‚Äî like how code works, what happens behind the scenes, how computers interpret programs, memory, logic, etc.\n2. Then I‚Äôll move on to **Python**, relearn it properly with all the basics and get confident with it.\n3. After that, I want to get into **C++**, so that I can understand things on a lower level and get better with performance, system-level thinking, etc.\n\nI'm also planning to go into **data structures and algorithms** in between, once I have a decent hold on Python.\n\nSo I‚Äôm mainly looking for **book recommendations** (or any really well-explained resources) for:\n\n* Basics of coding and general programming logic\n* Beginner to intermediate Python\n* DSA (preferably in Python, but general ones are okay too)\n* A good path to learn C++ after Python\n* Clean code, writing good code, and long-term coding habits\n\nIf there are any **video courses that explain things really well and in depth**, I‚Äôm open to them too, but my first preference will always be books.\n\nIf anyone here has gone through a similar journey or prefers reading like me, I‚Äôd love to hear your experience and suggestions. Thanks in advance!",

How would I go about programming a system like that where THEORETICALLY the game never lags, only throttles the tick speed and would it be possible to create a system that is not OS dependent? My only solution currently is to throttle the tick speed until CPU usage is under 80% or less but assume any package checking CPU usage is OS dependent.\n\nIf there's a better way (which i assume there is) im all ears as well.

I did not do that personally, our IT guy did, but I came up with the vision etc and I put in a few lines of code myself but will not take credit for what he's done.\n\nI've completed Foundational C# with Microsoft/freeCodeCamp and I'm like halfway through Harvard's free CS50 course.\n\nI'm still quite unfamiliar with Git or GitHub, but I kind of know how it's used and what it's purposes are.\n\nI really feel like I would be happy doing this as a career, but I am now 31 and I don't have a CS degree under my belt, I have a music production degree instead. How hard will it be to change careers to a programming one? I know I like more of the backend, logical problem solving. I'm not a big fan of designing websites using HTML/CSS although I'm somewhat familiar with them and would learn them more thoroughly quite quickly should I need to.\n\nI also have just had my first child last year and don't want to take too much of a paycut, I'm currently earning like 32k a year (this is in the UK) and maybe for the sake of it I'd go down to 28k but starting a programming job for 25k is a bit out of the question for me at the moment I feel, due to family commitments.\n\nCould anyone give me some words of advice please and maybe encouragement lol. I feel like I've been learning for so long and I want the ball to start rolling, as I know working in this field will only speed up my learning.\n\nShould I just start applying for jobs and see if can get anything or listen to their feedback? How hard are these interview coding problems I hear about? Got so many questions I can't even fit them all here.\n\nI'd appreciate any words of wisdom I could get",

Obviously the most successful application layer AI startups (Cursor, Windsfurf) are towards software engineers.   \n  \nDon't they realize that by replacing them and laying them off they wont pay for AI products and therefore no more revenue?   \n  \nObviously, someone will say most of their revenue comes from B2B. But the second B, meaning businesses which buy AI subscriptions en masse, are tech businesses which want to replace their software engineers.  \n  \nHowever, a large percentage of those sell software to software engineers or other tech companies or tech inclined people.

My question is: **Are there any accountants that switched FROM accounting to SWE? Why did you do so? What were the downsides of accounting that made you switch?**\n\nIt just seems like a way better fit for me personally. I always just wanted a stable, in-demand career that pays moderately well and has good work life balance. I was never interested in FAANG (even though I ended up working at 3 of them, and starting my career there.. but all that did was lead me to an insane burnout and I now work as a SWE at a bank).\n\nI'm jealous of:\n\n* The biggest one for me, is that their work is deterministic. They know when they walk into work that day, exactly what they will do and how long it will take them to do. In SWE? Not the case. I'm given a puzzle that I've never done before, given a deadline to finish it, and asked every single day (multiple times) how close I am to finishing it.\n* The fact that once they do their time at the Big 4 + get their CPA, they are basically set for life. The grind ACTUALLY seems to pay off in their career. In tech? You have to study LeetCode, OOP, System Design over and over and over every time you want to job hop\n* The fact that it's a stable job and literally everyone needs them.\n* The fact that their interviews consist of 1-2 behavioural rounds and that's literally it\n* Immune to AI and offshoring due to legal reasons\n\nAm I looking at accounting too positively?

Why is whenever I hear justification for H1B and STEM-OPT  everywhere on mainstream media, and even codified in US law, court transcripts and policy discussions: they keep saying there's a shortage of STEM workers, especially  tech workers and we need more immigrants to fill those roles. Why do we hear this all the time, but it's never actually supported by data?\n\nFurther, the department of labor actually has a list of jobs known to be in shortage and it doesn't use biased industry reports to determine them: it uses its own data as well as BLS data. This list is called \"Schedule A\" and it allows employers to fast track immigrant visas into these occupations without needing to go through the H1B process.\n\nBut the INA has this weird thing where if a prospective job pays under $60k the employer must recruit US workers first, but it does not offer that protection to jobs that pay over $60k or if the job requires a masters degree. Congress justified this, as saying jobs paying over $60k or requiring a masters is a reasonable proxy to a job that is in shortage. \nBut it's not. Schedule A has existed for just as long as the H1B came about in 1990. This makes me question the purpose of the H1B in the first place.\n\nIf the DOL has the ability to analyze the labor market and determine certain jobs are in dire need, and need skilled immigrant labor, and our those on a dynamic list every year, why do we have \"H1B\" at all? Why can't the actual jobs in shortage, be listed, and the jobs not in shortage have to prove they couldn't find a qualified US citizen before hiring an immigrant?\n\nIt seems congress relied on industry lobbying and their \"facts\" rather than our own DOL and BLS.",

What do you guys think would be the best things to have on your resume nowadays with no work experience, but a CS degree from 2021. I have worked multiple different industries and jobs since then but idek if its worth keeping those on my resume as it relates nothing to tech. I have coding knowledge and basic projects but I know thats not enough. I feel like I need to focus my energy on something with more potential for a positive return aka a job lol.\n\nHere are some ideas Ive had , \n\nMaking a ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù project in a not popular language. For example specialize entirely on mobile code using something like swift and show a specialization in this language. I feel like everyone‚Äôs learning java and python, myself included so would learning a specialized language be more desirable? Or should I just stick with something like a MERN stack and pump out projects that are ‚Äúmore complex‚Äù with more universal technologies. \n\nIf contributing to open source, idek how to put that into my resume? ‚ÄúI added three new functions that reduced latency by .5 ms‚Äù . Could I make this its own section where I say I have contributed to 10+ open source projects with a link to my github for them to check themselves. Would focusing on open source for experience to pad my resume be a good idea?\n\nAre there any certifications worth getting? AWS or Azure fundamentals? Agile or scrum certs? Cisco or A+ IT certs (even though I dont want to do IT) Anything for hiring managers to look more fondly on me?\n\nWhat are ways to become undeniable to employers that can be achieved through hard work, that most others arnt going to put the time into?\n\nI know its alot, appreciate any responses! \n\nEdit: Guys I know I wasted my potential, I put that in the title!

Today I received an email from google xWF asking if I was still interested in a SWE 2 early career role at google and could confirm I was ok with the locations so that we can move forward in the  process. Obviously I am, but how do I handle this? Do I mention to my google recruiter that I just signed an offer and am currently onboarding / close to starting? Does it reflect poorly on me to mention that I just started a position and now am essentially looking to  jump ships?  Im really happy with the offer  I have now, but having the opportunity to interview at google for the chance at a role there is imo something I just cant pass up on. Any tips on how I should handle initial convo with google recruiter? ",

        "content": "This isn't one of those nonsense posts like \"even medicine is easier than tech,\" \"medicine is AI-proof unlike tech,\" etc. Medicine is a difficult path and not one that should be taken lightly.\n\n**This is more of a rant, and maybe a warning to the many CS students who frequent this sub about what big tech is really like.**\n\nI'm a mid-level software engineer at a big tech company. I make a sizeable amount of money, I work hybrid, and I get plenty of vacation. And yet I'm miserable.\n\nAs the layoffs started, the company culture immediately rotted. I found myself pushing back on others' nonsensical, perf-driven demands. I was making decisions not for technical excellence but for less stressful approvals. I was constantly fighting off attempts to steal scope or credit. Then a coworker sabotaged my work and advertised to L7's how he already had a great plan to fix \"my\" mistakes. (He was promoted for this.)\n\n**I realized that a career in tech is not about good work or good skills. It's about politics, and it gets worse the more senior you get.** I spoke to some mid-level and senior friends, and they've all told me the same, with many of them questioning their careers too.\n\nI started not caring anymore about scalable architectures or sensible design decisions. I went looking for other jobs, then I realized nearly every big company is like this now, not just Amazon. I also realized quickly that all my cold applications were getting trashed without a look; only recruiter calls mattered. (Condolences to all the entry-level folks, it really is rough out there.)\n\n**More importantly, I started questioning the point of it all.** I pursued tech because I liked coding and designing. I liked the idea of working with others to build great things. And I liked the prospect of working anywhere in the world, and not being tied to a single company.\n\nBut above all I wanted to make an impact. I wanted to build software that improved millions of lives. I planned to work my way up to senior in the private sector, save a lot of money, then take a pay cut to go work for the government or a public contractor. Then Elon Musk destroyed that path.\n\nNow, I was studying so hard to get an offer to do... what? Squeeze out 0.02% more ad revenue? Get more people addicted to gambling? Exploit more vulnerable children? Or build tools to let other companies better do those things? Because that's what most big tech companies are, and why they pay the big bucks.\n\nIn college, I was a premed as well as a CS major. I had everything from lab research to volunteer hours, from the courses to the MCAT‚Äîall I had to do was send the med school applications. Then I chose to pursue tech instead. After years in the real world, I'm doubting my choice.\n\n**I'm not building things that matter. Most times, I'm not building at all.** Most of my time and energy is devoted to navigating office politics. I didn't sign up for this. I certainly can't imagine 30 more years in this career.\n\nI'm still searching for a new job. But if I don't get an offer in the next few months, I'll be studying again for the MCAT. (My old score expired‚Äîwhat a waste.)\n\nMedicine will be a long and tough road. I'll be working longer hours with less flexibility for somewhat less pay. But at least I'll be doing something that matters, something that makes me proud to go to work every morning. I'll have stress that's meaningful, and a sense of professional fulfillment beyond just my TC.\n\nAnd most of all, I won't have to deal with office politics, every day, every week, every year.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Three and a half years ago I graduated college and was pulled into a startup as the only US dev in a US startup for a full-stack position. The other two devs before me were in India. I was the only dev in the US (during working hours) for over a year before finally getting a second US full-stack dev (then a third and fourth front-end). Today, the small startup where I knew everyone's' name ended up getting bought out and had money pumped into it that ended up making it grow exponentially. Now I only see maybe 5% of who work in my company regularly. Because of my circumstanced, I have been categorized as the \"Go-To Person\" for getting stuff fixed or done in my company during the working hours.\n\nBefore we were bought out, I already had that reputation, being the longest standing dev on the US side. I would get pings from people every couple hours that needed assistance in something they were working on, or needed someone with \"expert knowledge\" on the software in a quick meeting. I was able to balance this with my own work decent enough to still be able to get my work done in a reasonable time. But since our side of the company got exponentially bigger since being bought out, now I get pings ever 15 - 30 min some days and my schedule has been loaded with meetings that require that dev with \"expert knowledge\", even though most of the time I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing (I'm good at figuring it out though).\n\nBecause of this, my productivity is shot. Tickets that should take 2 - 3 days are taking a week or more sometimes. I've talked to my manager over the last year about this and we have made an \"Ask a Dev\" channel for questions that aren't urgent (which has filtered out the obvious and obviously dumb questions that are asked from being asked), urgent stuff now gets filtered through the scrum master which she divides up between me and the only other full-stack that works during the workday, and we've preached, multiple times to not contact any dev directly, even though this only lasts for a little while before everyones \"Super Urgent!\" problem finds its way to my teams chat directly... again...\n\nSo take this as a warning. Don't become the \"Go-To Person\" of your company/division/team if you want to keep your sanity.\n\n  \nEdit: Spelling/grammer errors. I'm sure there is more, but I need to stop ranting and actually work",

In 2006 I graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in computer engineering, but I hated my classes (especially the EE circuits and signal processing ones) and was totally burned out by the time I graduated. Instead of joining the formal workforce, I've spent the last 20 years being an unpaid family caregiver for sick relatives. I literally haven't written a single line of code since graduation, and the only programming languages I've used were BASIC as a kid, Perl during an internship between high school and college, and C and C++ during school  - and C++ was only taught as \"C with classes\" with no mention of the Standard Template Library or any other library besides \"iostream.h\", so if I wanted to try to get a job in tech, I'd need to learn something people actually use today, such as Python, Java, or perhaps even R for data science and statistics. (I'm within commuting distance of NYC and the finance industry hires a lot of computer people.) I've also used SQL but forgotten almost all of it.\n\nAnyway, all the sick relatives I'd been taking care of died last year (including my wife üò•), so I need to find something else to do with my life. I have enough financial leeway that I won't actually need to work for quite a while, and I thought that if I wanted to pursue programming as a career, a (hopefully reputable) bootcamp might be a good option, because it would help me get up to speed on modern development and create a portfolio to show to potential employers. I'm also not particularly self-motivated or disciplined, so trying to learn on my own, without a structured program that has deadlines, wouldn't be my first choice of approach; if going to a physical classroom is an option, I would really prefer it over an online-only program because I'd be less likely to flake. Would the combination of my degree and having completed a bootcamp give me a reasonable chance of getting an entry level job *somewhere* in spite of my age and resume gap, or is the job market for programmers without work experience just that bad right now?",

They went from the entire world showering them with money and praise to investors getting on their asses and making them actually focus on the fundamentals of their business. 9 out of 10 startups fail, and never has that been more evident than 2025.\n\nSo 95 percent of their lives are just taking shit and eating it, from investors, from customers, from the overall sentiment of the country about tech. And yet in this very specific area, they are kings that get to make people arbitrarily jump through hoops on command and hear how great they are. I don't believe that the startup founders themselves think this is why they're doing it, but I bet this is why they're all convincing themselves that, as  owners of unprofitable small businesses, that they absolutely need that fourth and fifth interview.",

        "content": "I graduated in May 2023 with a Computer Science degree from a well respected program. Like many others in my class, it was tough landing a full-time role in this market. I did some contract work for a while until I was recently hired full-time as a ‚ÄúControls and Automation Specialist‚Äù. A basic summary of what my division in the company does is that we install and program factory computers.\n\nI didn‚Äôt think much of the title of the role before starting; it wasn‚Äôt heavily stressed as a distinguishing factor in the interview, job posting, or any further correspondence with the company. It wasn‚Äôt until I started that I came to understand that there is a significant distinction between ‚ÄúSpecialists‚Äù and ‚ÄúEngineers‚Äù in my division. Our engineers come from a variety of backgrounds, not just computer related, but from my current understanding, C+A Engineers have more career mobility within the company as well as higher salaries, even in entry-level roles.\n\nWhen I asked about the difference, I was told that because I have a ‚ÄúComputer Science‚Äù degree, I‚Äôm not considered an engineer and can‚Äôt be billed to clients as one. I thought this might be a regional thing, that software engineering isn‚Äôt yet considered ‚Äúreal‚Äù engineering in the southeast. But today I found out that one of our interns is titled an engineer but is pursuing a degree in Software Engineering; a degree that differs from Computer Science at their university by a single required course (Software Security).\n\nI have plenty of CS grad friends that went on to become Software Engineers, so I didn‚Äôt expect the wording of my degree to limit my role like this. I really like my coworkers, the work that I do, and the company I work for. I genuinely pictured myself being part of the company for the long-term. But it‚Äôs been hard not to feel like I‚Äôm missing out on long-term growth simply because of a technicality in how my education is labeled.\n\nHas anyone else run into this kind of title/pay/growth ceiling based on your degree title? \n\nWould love to hear how others have navigated this or similar situations, or just general suggestions or opinions on how to proceed.\n\nTLDR:\nCS grad working in controls/automation was told I can't hold an \"Engineer\" title, or access related pay and growth, because my degree isn‚Äôt labeled ‚ÄúEngineering,‚Äù despite doing similar work. Wondering if others have faced this and how they handled it.\n\n",

However, last year our company started a new company wide rule where we have to work some days in one of our actual retail stores. Now that I've done this multiple times, I actually hate it.\n\n1. Our customers don't like it when they realize that the person they're asking for help actually has no idea because they're a software dev cosplaying as a store employee. \"What type of item do you need to do ABC? I have no idea but let me ask a real store employee, 1 sec.\"\n\n2. I've had store employees treat me harshly upon meeting me because I'm a fake store employee just there for a day, I'm taking time away from them doing their regular stuff while they explain stuff to me, etc... and I also think some resent the salary discrepancy. Sometimes someone will tell me that their family member makes X amount of money and I don't say anything but I'm thinking \"I never asked, I'm just here to comply and keep my job\".\n\n3. None of the things that the store employees complain about are something that I even have any power whatsoever to change or fix. It's just not something that my team or department works on. And instead of me being there, why can't it just be an email from them directly to management? and how many more times am I going to have to keep doing this?\n\nAfter completing one of these visits I'm given an opportunity to fill out a survey which I always do, but then in the future I'm still told basically \"do it or you're fired\". It feels like a bait and switch to me because I joined this company to be a software dev and this program didn't exist at that time.\n\nI know the job market is bad at the moment so I'm continuing to comply, but I just wanted to vent to my fellow devs I guess.",

Can't say that I didn't expect that after few months of doing nothing, but I was really pissed off. At the time I could already be part of some nice project, get the know-how and be really productive in some other company.\n\n**2024 was my worst year in the industry in terms of looking for a new job, I was unemployed for few months after that company.**\n\nNow my current position - the same story. Very similiar IT Indian company, I won't give you any names but there is a few of them so you can probably figure it out. I was hired as backend dev at the beginning of the year, and so far I had few internal interviews for the various projects, but I don't even get feedback from them.\n\n**As I learned from my previous experience I have found another job as the contractor in the bank and I'm doing great here.**\n\nMy employment in the do-nothing-company terminates in few months and I'm not resigning until they actually try put me on a project. I don't feel like I am cheating because this is second time that someone wastes my time. I'm still a beginner in the industry and in this very crowded market on every single interview everyone asks me about my experience in all the companies I've been working for - **I don't want to lie on my resume, but I also don't want to tell my interviewer that professionally I was not engaged in any project/team since the end of 2023, and why I am jumping between companies after barely 6 months of employment.**\n\nSo, do you have experience like this? I know that sometimes you just sit on the bench as a contractor, but this is other situation and often after some time you just stop getting paid. Here I was full time employed, got paid and contributed absolutely nothing, twice. I probably won't even mention my current do-nothing-company on my CV.\n\nI'm sick of companies that are looking for developer while not having any position for them. And I completely understand that this is kind of a privilige nowadays and sounds like a dream job for many people, but in IT every year of your experience counts, and If you was hired on paper but got nothing from it, then it's going to turn out terribly for you in the future. Of course in both of those companies I tried to utilize my time and try to learn/work with new things on my own, but this is not the same. And obviously for the entire past year I was constantly stressed, not sure about my future and I felt there was no stability in my life and that something is wrong with me.",

Are there fields in this industry that do not require programming? aside from sales/PM of course\n\nI've been seeing a lot of posts on here that say SWE/Programming is not the end-all-be-all for CS. ...but I'm wondering if people are confusing the two or perhaps I'm misguided. Yeah I believe that as a CS guy/gal, you might not be responsible for building and developing complex systems that communicate and work with each other (in fact I believe 2025 SWE is just  Distributed Systems in disguise but we can argue about that in my next post)\n\nMy question: is there really any field within CS that does not require at least some programming skills for survival (and No I'm not talking a FullStack Dev, maybe a niche position)?\n\nContext:  \n1.I always thought **Networking** was how I would escape programming. Sure, there are many tools that automate some of these processes, but from my tiny experience in this domain, there seems to be many situations where writing custom scripts gives you the advantage?\n\n2.**System Admins/CyberSecurity:** C'mon Sys Admins/CyberSecurity Consultants, you shouldn't even be in this discussion since I know you guys have to or perhaps should automate some of those tasks you handle every day lol\n\n3\\*\\*.UI/UX Designers:\\*\\*  A lot of the UI/UX designers in my circle were slowly funneled into jobs that required them to also know some FE Programming. (This might be an issue within my country). After that, they slowly realized FE isn't enough and you gotta know some BE. And the current market push in my country is forcing FullStack devs into DevOps\n\n4.**DB Admins**: Early in my admin, a client asked my company to switch from SQL to MongoDB for reasons...that was hell. They had 100s of thousands of documents\n\nSo again, what are these jobs that do not require programming and especially Leetcode\n\n**Edit: please share what tips you got!** ",

It's been tough even getting interviews but I've had 4 so far and advanced to the final round of one of them, but unfortunately didn't get it. \n\nLast week on Monday for some reason I had 4 recruiters reach out to me for a HR Interview/ call. They were all rlly cool/big companies so I got my hopes up. Each Recruiter on the call told me they would like to schedule a technical round with me for the next week and that I would soon be getting an email to schedule that technical interview. \n\nAll of them told me I'd get the email for further steps in 1-2 days after the call, but after waiting an extra day for each I respectfully followed up with the recruiters and got no response from all 3. I have one more interview coming up from the last recruiter, but idk how this one's gonna go cuz my resume is the most different from this job so im just studying up as much as i can. This was super dissapointing cuz I've been studying a lot so I just wanted to vent. \n\nIs this a common practice for New Grad recruiters to ghost the ppl they interview after telling them they advanced?",

Or you will see in work places arbitrary deadlines set by management and no real flexibility around these deadlines nor any data backing up how they came to the conclusion how that deadline was reached.\n\nFirst, I think developers need to stop making up for managements lack of skill. Make them either descope work, extend deadlines, or hire more people if they have unrealistic deadlines. Do not work overtime for a company that is not going to pay you extra to do so and will lay you off even if you work extra time for them.\n\nSecond, I think most companies would be better off if they automated away most of these positions. I think it would lead to more realistic deadlines, less unreasonable requests to developers, less missed deadlines or poor coding practices because realistic deadlines would be in place, and an all around better experience for everyone including investors.\n\nI think this should be the new movement.

Super excited, but nervous since there‚Äôs no real junior dev pipeline or formal training, and I‚Äôm jumping straight from student to full-time dev in a small team that mostly hires experienced people.\n\n\n\nI interned at this company for about 1.5 years with 8 moths full-time and the rest part-time.\n\nDuring that time, I worked on a pretty wide range of stuff: manually testing new software, creating architectural diagrams, documenting codebases, and toward the end, helping a new AI team build web apps with AI-driven features.\n\nIt‚Äôs been about two months since the internship ended. When I wrapped up, there was talk of a full-time offer closer to graduation (which is in August). But recently, they reached out and said they‚Äôd actually like to offer me a position now‚Äîstarting part-time, then moving to full-time after I graduate. I asked about the role, and they said ‚ÄúAI Developer,‚Äù which basically just means I‚Äôd be a software dev on the AI use case team (so not data science or ML).\n\nI‚Äôm super excited because I loved the team environment and like most of us our dream is software dev. That said, I‚Äôm also nervous.\n\nThis company isn‚Äôt a tech company, it‚Äôs actually pretty far from one. And because of that, the structure is a bit different. There‚Äôs not really a formal junior engineer pipeline or training program. Most people get hired with several years of experience already under their belt. I do know a couple folks who came in a year or two after graduating, but even then, it was through a setup where they‚Äôd already been doing independent contract work for a while.\n\nI know I‚Äôm a strong developer, and I learn quickly, but I also know I benefit a lot from structure and guidance. Obviously working with the team towards the end of my internship did give me SOME experience, but I still feel like the jump from student to full time dev is massive and I‚Äôm worried about working in an environment that might not have that change in the forefront of their mind. Especially given that the team I‚Äôd join only has a handful of developers (maybe 3).",

        "content": "Roblox PhD Internship interview reflection\n\nI'm a third year PhD student at a t20, no visa sponsorship required. Generally work on applying LLM and graph neural networks to social science problems. Applied for a PhD research intern position.\n\n1. Got OA, it was dumb as fuck. Had to download and play games in Roblox. They're basically iq tests where you had to do like factory optimization and design cars to cross obstacle courses or whatever. I was just like fuck it and got basically a 0 on the first game and gave up on the rest because it wasn't worth the effort lol. \n\n2. Recruiter schedules a call with me and basically tells me I'm moving on to the interview calls. Tells me to just redo the OAs for completion and basically that the scores don't matter. I guess they do resume screening before OA results and if your experience is relevant enough they don't care lmao. \n\n3. Get a crappy score on the second game, and third OA segment is a bunch of behavioral scenarios, like \"your boss is wrong about something, how do you approach the situation\". No coding OA, interestingly. \n\n4. Had a thirty minute behavioral round with pretty standard questions, \"tell me about a project where you had a different approach than stakeholders wanted\", etc etc. \n\n5. 45 minute coding round. Really easy? I feel like I've seen other internship reports where people are getting LC hards, maybe they make it easier for the research positions. Question was basically valid parentheses but you also had to handle quote strings. Seemed like it focused more on like communication and figuring out how to handle edge cases. \n\n6. Then they scheduled a ML deep dive with the hiring manager. 1 hour, I basically presented a few of my papers and they asked pretty detailed questions about how I made specific training/dataset/evaluation questions. Lots of reflection on what I could've done differently etc. I really enjoyed this round, it felt like a very good way to measure expertise and ML depth. \n\n7. Whole process took place over 2-3 weeks, very efficient, quick feedback and scheduling of next rounds. I got the official offer 3 business days after the last round. \n\nOverall very good process! Much easier than I expected, but it's possible they identified a research fit and wanted to hurry the process along a bit lol. If they didn't make people do the silly games, I'd say it was a nearly perfect process. ",

I've been in professional development since then.\n\nThis go-around trying to find my next position has been rough, even worse than when I was first started looking for jobs after graduating from the bootcamp. By this time in my search 6 years ago I already had around 9 interviews under my belt. I was applying as routinely as I am today and I had no experience whatsoever, my resume was shit, and I had no solid personal projects to my name. This time around I have gotten 1 interview which seems somewhat promising, but have heard almost nothing beyond that.\n\nToday I FINALLY got in touch with a recruiter who has a (potential) position for me, but he suggested that I may be having a hard time because I do not have a degree and I might be \"filtered out\".\n\nDo people think it's worth getting a CS degree as someone who already has 6+ years pro experience? I know the obvious answer is \"it couldn't hurt\", but is the time and energy put towards a CS degree something that will be particularly beneficial for someone in my position?\n\nOne of the benefits of this career for me was that a degree wasn't necessary to be successful.

Now I'm looking for work and I'm considering trying to get a degree in something from a legit college, but I'm not sure how hard it is to find an entry level job period, let alone find an entry level job at 50 in the tech field.\n\nThe school I'm considering will count the degree I have toward the common core stuff, so basically I'd need just the classes specific to my major. Is it worth spending the money on or am I better off hoping to catch on to some random job that doesn't require a relevant degree?\n\n  \nETA:\n\nThanks to everyone who provided constructive and helpful feedback. To answer some questions: No, CS isn't my dream. I had an interest and aptitude for it when I was young, but I really don't care about it anymore. This is just a terrible job market and I'm trying to find some way to improve my resume in the hopes of finding a halfway decent job, like lots of people.\n\nSo why CS? because believe or not, it keeps getting recommended by people as a \"good field for career changers and older workers.\" Even the silly aptitude test thing they make new students take at the University recommends it and frankly, my impression of the tech field has always been that it's crowded, being heavily outsourced and potentially negatively impacted by AI in the same way my old profession as a writer has been. So, the point of this post was to find out from people who actually work in the field if my impression was wrong and all the people recommending it are right or full of shit. Seems the consensus is that my impression was right and I should look at other options.",

        "author": "double-happiness",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I'm 52, not from a STEM background and only graduated in CS at age 49 (full backstory [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11g5wjf/graduated_in_cs_at_age_49_but_ive_ended_up_doing/)). After circa 800 applications and about a dozen interviews I finally got a role with the UK Civil Service for nearly 2 years, initially as a Trainee Software Engineer on a fixed-term contract at ¬£22K, but managed to get a slight promotion into another fixed-term contract as Junior Software Engineer and was on ¬£27K by the time my contract was due to expire. (There was no chance of renewal as it was maternity cover). I made over 100 applications but only had one offer, this time as Software Engineer for a small firm in the renewable energy installation sector. The range was stated to be ¬£35K - ¬£50K; they only offered ¬£36K but with no other offers and only 1 week left of my contract I thought I had better take what I could get. (Worth bearing in mind that AFAIK Scotland and the North doesn't tend to offer anything like the salaries one tends to get in London anyway though).\n\nOn my very first day they made 5 people redundant but I was told not to worry as my salary was paid for out of grant money. Obviously that raises the question what's going to happen when the grant money runs out. I should say I am the only SWE and there are no IT staff at all, just installers, operations, and sales people basically. My supervisor and myself didn't hit it off very well and things were a bit tense trying to work out exactly what they wanted me to do. It was all quite nebulous and completely different from the Civil Service as you might expect. No tickets, no version control in place, basically just 'here's your laptop and this is what we want'. They want me to build an API aggregator that brings together API services from a number of different renewable energy manufacturers (that's what the grant money is for). I was sharing an office with an 'actual' engineer (i.e. an electrical engineer), but he left for another firm that was going to give him better training / certs. Seemingly they wouldn't give him a ¬£3K raise and amazingly it turned out he was on even less than me, even though he had far more responsibility and went out on jobs and all sorts.\n\nI have built this whole web application for them in TS/JS/Node/React/Express. I have used a certain amount of AI (mainly Claude, also Perplexity) to help me along, but in fairness I now have no senior dev to turn to for advice. I have actually found it helps my learning quite a bit and I ask it tons of learning questions instead of just blindly copy-pasting. In fact I sometimes tell it *not* to give me any code, but just advice/guidance. I have pushed it all to a GitHub repo but so far it has not been deployed. It is about 100 or so files, thousands of lines of code, takes in 3 different APIs, does both local and browser DB stuff, and has a lot of unit tests written in Jest. If I say so myself it is pretty neat and everyone who has seen it has been impressed. It is dead fast and has a lot of error handling. The UI is only so-so as that's not really my forte, but I've seen worse.\n\nThe problems are many though. The low salary, almost total lack of job security, no bank holidays (WTF?), and now my supervisor has really started to become quite unpleasant. Yesterday he totally bit my head off because I had the temerity to ask if I had now got through my probation OK, since that was due to finish on the 10th. He accused me of being 'irritable', said I must have been 'dwelling on it', and that apparently I should have been 'proactive' and mentioned it earlier. The last I think is total nonsense as I was patiently waiting for him to tell me the probation was done. To my mind it could have come across as quite premature to bring it up prior to the date. When I showed him some code I had written he said 'there must be an easier way of doing it than that', which I thought was tantamount to saying I had gone about it the long way. OFC he never stated what the easier way might be. Seemingly he did some MATLAB back in the day but doesn't like other languages because they use 0-indexing for arrays (SMH). Yesterday he came in, I asked him how he was, but he didn't reciprocate and said nothing at all to me for 3-4 hours, literally not a word. It was only when I asked him about the probation he then kicked off.\n\nThe owner (who sits in the office next to mine) is fine and I get along with him no problem. The other office staff are OK but I feel totally out of it as they are focussed on sales and installations, and I just have almost no sense of being part of a team like I at least somewhat had in CS. There I had so little to do, I felt like a substitute sat on the bench on the sidelines, but at least I was around other devs who were mainly very supportive in my 'learning journey'. Being an older entrant into the IT sector (I couldn't even afford a PC until I got a hand-me-down in my late 20s) is not always easy, as you might imagine.\n\nSo WTH am I gonna do? Try to brush up [my CV](https://i.imgur.com/JzEFPuP.png) and just start applying, I guess? Trying to move on after 3 months seems like a big ask. There are only limited opportunities in southern Scotland and fully remote, and I am not at all willing to sell my home (again), especially after only 7 months here. I use all [these sites](https://i.imgur.com/g8ggTlb.png) and find LinkedIn never even gets me so much as an interview. I have previously sent a lot of CVs to recruiters and built up a quite big list of their contacts. I have nearly 250 connections on LinkedIn with a lot of recruiters and devs. Having made nearly 1000 applications in the last 2.5 years I know what to do but the 3 months is a big problem, right?!?\n\nTIA for any (constructive) advice.\n\nEdit to add: one thing that did occur to me is maybe I should lean into the situation and ask for more money. But perhaps that could backfire?",

        "content": "I‚Äôm seeking advice on how to handle my work history in interviews. My situation is complicated, and I don‚Äôt want to come across as someone who quits easily.\n\nMy first job was a six-month contract that didn‚Äôt get renewed‚Äînot because of my performance, but because the deputy director informed all contract staff that we would be \"released to the market on our knowledge.\" I worked around the clock to deliver my assignments, but there was nothing I could do to secure a renewal.\n\nAfraid that I wouldn‚Äôt find another opportunity quickly, I accepted my next offer without much hesitation‚Äîonly to discover that the company had almost no real software development expertise. The local team was constantly misled by overseas developers, and the leadership, despite lacking technical knowledge, refused to acknowledge the gaps. It was like watching The Emperor‚Äôs New Clothes play out in real life.\n\nTo make matters worse, my new team lead in the last government linked company sabotaged me. After completing my assignments and demonstrating my work to the project manager and team lead, he withheld key information from the project director. He told her that I didn‚Äôt know how to import libraries‚Äîbut he didn‚Äôt mention that I had already finished the task successfully. Because the project director lacked technical expertise, she dismissed me based on that remark.\n\nAdditionally, I had assumed that a \"senior software engineer\" in the team before i joined the new team would have solid technical knowledge. Instead, she was actually a business analyst, and actively made my life difficulty by constantly given me wrong infor that I need to point out to her. They actually insisted the correct way of pushing your code up is git diff.\n\nGiven all of this, how should I explain my work history in interviews? I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm badmouthing past employers, but I also don‚Äôt want to be vague and appear like someone who simply couldn‚Äôt handle the roles. How do I frame my experiences in a way that is honest, yet professional?\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

        "content": "about 6 months or so ago, I left my previous company because i was put on a CP (coaching plan). So while i was on the CP, a company had reached out to me indicating that they wanted to interview me. however the company was a contracting company with the possibility of conversion being pretty high. however, they have told me that conversion is probably not possible anymore. However, while i was job hunting my previous company had reached back out to me and indicated that they wanted to interview me. I ended up getting the job and it is a fulltime gig. Should i go ahead and just take it ? would that make the most sense since I have a contracting role and the role is about to end in september ? i was thinking of using my offer as leverage to get a FT role but was hoping to get an idea of what the community thought \n\nthanks !
