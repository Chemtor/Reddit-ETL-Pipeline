I have been working with Snowflake writing stored procedures, spark using databricks, ADF for orchestration, SQL server, power BI & Tableau dashboards. All the data processing has been either monthly or quarterly. I was always under the impression that I was going to be quite employable when I try to switch at some point.\n\nBut the past few months have taught me that there aren't many data analyst openings and the field doesn't pay squat and is mostly for freshers and the data engineering that I have been doing isn't really actual data engineering.\n\nAll the openings I see require knowledge of Kafka, docker, kubernetes, microservices, airflow, mlops, API integration, CI/CD etc. This has left me stunned at the very least. I never knew that most of the companies required such a diverse set of skills and data engineering was more of SWE rather than what I have been doing. Seriously not sure what to think of the scenario I am in.",

Here are a few:\n- We are in a near constant state of migration. We keep moving from one cloud provider to another for no real reason at all, and are constantly decommissioning ETL pipelines and making new ones to serve the same purpose. \n- We have many data vendors, each of which has its own standard (in terms of format, access etc). This requires us to make a dedicated ETL pipeline for each vendor (with some degree of code reuse).\n- Tribal knowledge and poor documentation plagues everything. We have tables (and other data assets) with names that are not descriptive and poorly documented. And so, data discovery (to do something like composing an analytical query) requires discussion with senior level employees who are have tribal knowledge. Doing something as simple as writing a SQL query took me much longer than expected for this reason.\n- Integrating new data vendors seems to always be an ad-hoc process done by higher ups, and is not done in a way that involves the people who actually work with the data on a day-to-day basis. \n\nI don’t intend to complain. I just want to know if other people are facing the same issues as I am. If this is true, then I’ll start figuring out a solution to solve this problem. \n\nAdditionally, if there are other problems you’d like to point out (other than people being difficult to work with), please do so.

I see that there is a lot of debate about the DE role itself, so I'm not sure if there is a consensus of this role either. Basically, my DE job entails creating SQL tables, but more so than that a ton of my time just goes into trying to figure out what people want without any proper guidance or documentation. I don't interact with the stakeholders but I have colleagues who are supposed to translate to me what the stakeholders want. Except that they don't...they just tell me to complete a task with my only guiding documents being PDFs, data dictionaries, other documents related to the projects. Sometimes, my only guidance is previous projects, but when I use those as templates I'm told I can't rely on that since every project is different. This ends up just being a constant back and forth stream and when there is a level of concensus reached as to what exactly the project is supposed to accomplish, it finally becomes a clean table in SQL that is frequently used as the backend data source for a front-end application for stakeholders to use (I don't build this application). \n\nI have touched Python very rarely at my job. I am supposed to get a task where I should be doing more stuff in Python but I'm not sure if that's even going to happen. \n\nI'm kind of more a technically minded person. When my job requires me to find solutions by writing code and developing, I feel like I can tolerate my job more.  I'm not finding my current responsibilities technical enough for my liking. The biggest gripe I have is that the person who should be helping guide me with business/stakeholder needs is frequently too busy to communicate properly with me and never tells me what exactly the project is, what the stakeholders want and keeps telling me to 'read documents' to figure it out, documents that have zero guidance as to the project. When things get delayed because I have to spend forever trying to figure out what exactly I should be doing, there's a lot of frustration directed at me. \n\nI personally think I'd be happier as a backend SWE, but I am uncertain and would love to hear from others what they preferred between DE and SWE and why. I would consider changing to a different DE role but with SQL being the only thing I use (I do have experience otherwise in Python and JavaScript, just not at my current job), I'm afraid I'm not going to be technically competitive enough for other DE roles either. I don't know what else to consider if I want to switch jobs. I've been told my skills may transfer to project/product management but that's not at all the direction I was thinking of taking my career in....\n\n\n\n",

A single platform where I can test them on DAGs (airflow / dbt), SQL, Python, system diagrams, etc and also save the feedback for each test.\n\nThanks!",

We recently ran some detailed benchmarks comparing its performance and cost against several popular data movement tools: Fivetran, Debezium (using the memiiso setup mentioned), Estuary, and Airbyte. The benchmarks covered both full initial loads and Change Data Capture (CDC) on a large dataset (billions of rows for full load, tens of millions of changes for CDC) over a 24-hour window.\n\nMore details here: [https://olake.io/docs/connectors/postgres/benchmarks](https://olake.io/docs/connectors/postgres/benchmarks)  \nHow the dataset was generated: [https://github.com/datazip-inc/nyc-taxi-data-benchmark/tree/remote-postgres](https://github.com/datazip-inc/nyc-taxi-data-benchmark/tree/remote-postgres)\n\n# Some observations:\n\n* OLake hit \\~46K rows/sec sustained throughput across billions of rows without bottlenecking storage or compute.\n* $75 cost was infra-only (no license fees). Fivetran and Airbyte costs ballooned mostly due to runtime and license/credit models.\n* OLake retries gracefully. No manual interventions needed unlike Debezium.\n* Airbyte struggled massively at scale — couldn't complete run without retries. Estuary better but still \\~11x slower.\n\nSharing this to understand if these numbers also match with your personal experience with these tool.\n\nNote: Full Load is free for Fivetran. ",

For example, if a model score > 1 would break the downstream app, you catch that issue (and then log it/warn and/or raise an exception). You’d also easily isolate the records with problematic data. This isn’t revolutionary or new - what I wanted was a way to do this in fewer lines of code in a way that’d be more understandable to people who inherit it. There are other packages that aren’t pandas specific that *can* do the same things, like great expectations and pydantic, but the code is a lot more verbose. \n\nReally I just want honest feedback. If people don’t find it useful, I won’t put more time into it. \n\npip install framecheck\n\n\nRepo with reproducible examples:\n\nhttps://github.com/OlivierNDO/framecheck\n\n\n",

But that didn't change, it was like that before the increase in costs.\n* The tables follow the \\[One Big Table\\](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/one-big-table/) data modelling \n* It could be something else, but the incremental in costs came just after that.\n\nMy question would be, is it possible that changing the partition granularity from DAY to MONTH resulted in such a huge increase or would it be something else that we are not aware of?",

But that is just one of three ways to stand up Debezium.\n\nDebezium Engine (the core Java library) and Debezium Server (a stand alone implementation) are pretty different than the Kafka offering.

I thought about starting with SQLite, as it seems the simplest and most approachable solution given the context.\n\nI'm not new to SQL and I understand the general idea behind normalization. What I am struggling with is the practical implementation. Every resource on ETL that I have found seems to focus on the basic steps, without discussing the practical side of normalizing data before loading.\n\nI am looking for books, tutorials, videos, articles — anything, really — that might help.\n\nThank you!",

        "content": "I would like to hear any recommendations for my future studies.\n\nI'm a Data Engineer with 3YOE, and I'm going to share some of my background to introduce myself and help you guide me through my doubts.\n\nI'm from third world country and have an Advanced English already, but still today working for national companyes earning less than 30k USD yearly.\n\nI graduated in Mechanical Engineering, and because of that, I feel I lack knowledge in Computer Science subjects, which I'm really interested in.\n\nCompany 1 – I started my career as a Power BI Developer for 1.5 years in a consulting company. I consider myself advanced in Power BI — not an expert, but someone who can solve most problems, including performance tuning, RLS, OLS, Tabular Editor, etc.\n\nCompany 2 – I built and delivered a Data Platform for a retail company (+7000 employees) using Microsoft Fabric. I was the main and principal engineer for the platform for 1.5 years, using Azure Data Factory, Dataflows, Spark Notebooks (basic Spark and Python, such as reading, writing, using APIs, partitioning...), Delta Tables (very good understanding), schema modeling (silver and gold layers), lakehouse governance, understanding business needs, and creating complex SQL queries to extract data from transactional databases. I consider myself intermediate-advanced in SQL (for the market), including window functions, CTEs, etc. I can solve many intermediate and almost all easy LeetCode problems.\n\nCompany 3 – I just started (20,000+ employees). I'm working in a Data Integration team, using a lot of Talend for ingestion from various sources, and also collaborating with the Databricks team.\n\nFreelance Projects (2 years) – I developed some Power BI dashboards and organized databases for two small companies using Sheets, excel and BigQuery.\n\nNowadays, I'm learning a lot of Talend to deliver my work in the best way possible. By the end of the year, I might need to move to another country for family reasons. I’ll step away from the Data Engineering field for a while and will have time to study (maybe for 1.5 years), so I would like to strengthen my knowledge base.\n\nI can program in Python a bit. I’ve created some functions, connected to Microsoft Graph through Spark Notebooks, ingested data, and used Selenium for personal projects. I haven't developed my technical skills further mainly because I haven't needed to use Python much at work.\n\nI don’t plan to study Databricks, Snowflake, Data Factory, DBT, BigQuery, and AIs deeply, since I already have some experience with them. I understand their core concepts, which I think is enough for now. I’ll have the opportunity to practice these tools through freelancing in the future. I believe I just need to understand what each tool does — the core concepts remain the same. Or am I wrong?\n\nI’ve planned a few things to study. I believe a Data Engineer with 5 years of experience should starts understand algorithms, networking, programming languages, software architecture, etc. I found the OSSU University project (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). Since I’ve already completed an engineering degree, I don’t need to do everything again, but it looks like a really good path.\n\nSo, my plan — following OSSU — is to complete these subjects over the next 1.5 years:\n\nSystematic Program Design\n\nClass-based Program Design\n\nProgramming Languages, Part A (Is that necessary?)\n\nProgramming Languages, Part B (Is that necessary?)\n\nProgramming Languages, Part C (Is that necessary?)\n\nObject-Oriented Design\n\nSoftware Architecture\n\nMathematics for Computer Science (Is that necessary?)\n\nThe Missing Semester of Your CS Education (Looks interesting)\n\nBuild a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris\n\nBuild a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part II\n\nOperating Systems: Three Easy Pieces\n\nComputer Networking: a Top-Down Approach\n\nDivide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms\n\nGraph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures\n\nGreedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming\n\nShortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them\n\nCybersecurity Fundamentals\n\nPrinciples of Secure Coding\n\nIdentifying Security Vulnerabilities\n\nIdentifying Security Vulnerabilities in C/C++ \n\nProgramming or Exploiting and Securing Vulnerabilities in Java Applications\n\nDatabases: Modeling and Theory\n\nDatabases: Relational Databases and SQL\n\nDatabases: Semistructured Data\n\nMachine Learning\n\nComputer Graphics\n\nSoftware Engineering: Introduction\nEthics, Technology and Engineering (Is that necessary?)\n\nIntellectual Property Law in Digital Age (Is that necessary?)\n\nData Privacy Fundamentals\nAdvanced programming\n\nAdvanced systems\n\nAdvanced theory\n\nAdvanced Information Security\n\nAdvanced math (Is that necessary?)\n\n\nAny other recommendations is very welcoming!!",

I’m using tools I love — GCP, Airflow, Spark, SQL — and have built a strong reputation with my manager, who’s expressed interest in converting me to full-time when the budget allows. The catch? There’s no clear timeline, and I’m expecting my first child later this year, so stability and benefits are becoming a priority.\n\nNow, I’ve been approached with a full-time offer at a smaller company working in healthcare data. The role offers the stability I’m looking for, but the tech stack centers around Microsoft Fabric, which I know is still new and polarizing in the data engineering community. I haven’t worked with Fabric directly, but I understand the concepts (like medallion architecture, data governance, etc.). I’m just not sure if this is the right move for long-term growth — especially since I enjoy hands-on coding and working with more flexible, open tools.\n\nMy questions:\nHas anyone made a similar shift from tools they love to a more rigid/abstracted stack? How did it go?\n\nHow much of a “career risk” is moving into Fabric right now, given it’s still maturing?\n\nWhat would you prioritize in this situation — toolset you love or full-time security (especially with a growing family)?\n\nWhat other factors should I be weighing in this kind of decision?\n\nAppreciate any insights or personal experiences you can share!\n",

I thought I'd save the next person a circuitous journey by just laying out the 1-2-3 steps (huge shout out to o3). Full tutorial linked below - but these steps are the true TL;DR 👇\n\n# 1. Set up your stack with docker\n\nSave this as `docker-compose.yml` (includes Postgres, Kafka, Zookeeper, and Kafka Connect):\n\n    services:\n      zookeeper:\n        image: quay.io/debezium/zookeeper:3.1\n        ports: [\"2181:2181\"]\n      kafka:\n        image: quay.io/debezium/kafka:3.1\n        depends_on: [zookeeper]\n        ports: [\"29092:29092\"]\n        environment:\n          ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181\n          KAFKA_LISTENERS: INTERNAL://0.0.0.0:9092,EXTERNAL://0.0.0.0:29092\n          KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: INTERNAL://kafka:9092,EXTERNAL://localhost:29092\n          KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT,EXTERNAL:PLAINTEXT\n          KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: INTERNAL\n          KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1\n      connect:\n        image: quay.io/debezium/connect:3.1\n        depends_on: [kafka]\n        ports: [\"8083:8083\"]\n        environment:\n          BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS: kafka:9092\n          GROUP_ID: 1\n          CONFIG_STORAGE_TOPIC: connect_configs\n          OFFSET_STORAGE_TOPIC: connect_offsets\n          STATUS_STORAGE_TOPIC: connect_statuses\n          KEY_CONVERTER_SCHEMAS_ENABLE: \"false\"\n          VALUE_CONVERTER_SCHEMAS_ENABLE: \"false\"\n      postgres:\n        image: debezium/postgres:15\n        ports: [\"5432:5432\"]\n        command: postgres -c wal_level=logical -c max_wal_senders=10 -c max_replication_slots=10\n        environment:\n          POSTGRES_USER: dbz\n          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: dbz\n          POSTGRES_DB: inventory\n\nThen run:\n\n    bashdocker compose up -d\n\n# 2. Configure Postgres and create test table\n\n    bash\n    # Create replication user\n    docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"CREATE USER repuser WITH REPLICATION ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'repuser';\"\n    \n    # Create test table\n    docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"CREATE TABLE customers (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), email VARCHAR(255));\"\n    \n    # Enable full row images for updates/deletes\n    docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"ALTER TABLE customers REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;\"\n\n# 3. Register Debezium connector\n\nCreate a file named `register-postgres.json`:\n\n    json{\n      \"name\": \"inventory-connector\",\n      \"config\": {\n        \"connector.class\": \"io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector\",\n        \"database.hostname\": \"postgres\",\n        \"database.port\": \"5432\",\n        \"database.user\": \"repuser\",\n        \"database.password\": \"repuser\",\n        \"database.dbname\": \"inventory\",\n        \"topic.prefix\": \"inventory\",\n        \"slot.name\": \"inventory_slot\",\n        \"publication.autocreate.mode\": \"filtered\",\n        \"table.include.list\": \"public.customers\"\n      }\n    }\n\nRegister it:\n\n    bash\n    curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data u/register-postgres.json http://localhost:8083/connectors\n\n# 4. Test it out\n\nOpen a Kafka consumer to watch for changes:\n\n    bash\n    docker compose exec kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --topic inventory.public.customers --from-beginning\n\nIn another terminal, insert a test row:\n\n    bash\n    docker compose exec postgres psql -U dbz -d inventory -c \"INSERT INTO customers(name,email) VALUES ('Alice','alice@example.com');\"\n\n**🏁 You should see a JSON message appear in your consumer with the change event! 🏁**\n\nOf course, if you already have a database running locally, you can extract that from the docker and adjust the connector config (step 3) to just point to that table.\n\nI wrote a [complete step-by-step tutorial](https://blog.sequinstream.com/postgres-cdc-with-debezium-complete-step-by-step-tutorial/) with detailed explanations of each step if you need a bit more detail!",

Recently, I started looking for new opportunities for growth, and started applying. Instant rejections.\n\nNow I know the job market isn't the hottest right now, but the one thing I'm struggling with is understanding what's missing. How do I know what my experience should have, when I'm applying to a certain job/industry? I'm eager to learn, but without a sense of direction or something to compare myself with, it's extremely difficult to figure out. \n\nThe general guideline is to connect/network with people, but after countless LinkedIn connection requests I still can't find someone who would be interested in discussing their experiences.\n\nSo my question is simple. How do you guys figure out what to do to shape your career? How do you know what you need to learn to get to a certain position?",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi,\n\nWe're advising a client who is just wants to start to establish a centralized ETL orchestration platform — both from a technical and organizational perspective. Currently, they mainly want to run batch job pipelines, and a clear requirement is that the orchestration tool must be self-hosted on Kubernetes AND OSS.\n\nMy initial thought was to go with Apache Airflow, but the growing ecosystem of \"next-gen\" tools (e.g. Dagster, Prefect, Mage, Windmill etc.) makes it hard to keep track of the trade-offs.\n\nAt the moment, I tend towards either Airflow or Dagster to get somehow started..\n\nMy key questions:\n\n* What are the meaningful pros and cons of Airflow vs. Dagster in real-world deployments?\n* One key thing could also be that the client wants this platform useable by different teams and therefore a good Multi-tenancy setup would be helpful. Here I see that Airflow has disadvantges compared to most of \"next-gen\" tools like Dagster? Do you agree/disagree?\n* Are there technical or organizational arguments for preferring one over the other?\n* One thing that bothers me with many Airflow alternatives is that the open-source (self-hosted) version often comes with feature limitations (e.g. multi-tenant support, integrations, or observability e.g. missing audit logs etc.). How has your experience been with this??\n\nAn opinion from experts who built a similar self-hosted setup would therefore be very interesting :)",

        "content": "I’ve recently intervwed for a couple of data engineering roles. While the market is incredibly competitive right now, I’ve been fortunate to land some intervws (can’t say the word for some reason). My background includes one internship specifically in data engineering, while the rest of my experience has been in software engineering. That said, I’ve always been more drawn to the data side of engineering and find the work much more fulfilling.\n\nDuring my most recent internship, I gained hands-on experience with Python and SQL, and took ownership of ETL workflows using AWS Glue. I also worked with services like S3, Athena, EC2, and Lambda, which helped me build end-to-end data integrations. The role pushed me to learn quickly and solve real-world data problems, and I came out of it feeling much more capable and confident in my data engineering skills.\n\nThat said, the intervws I’ve had have been quite challenging—often diving deep into areas I hadn’t yet worked with. For example, I’ve been asked questions about topics like write-ahead logs (WALs) or when to use OLTP vs. OLAP systems. These weren’t covered in my internship, so I’m actively working to strengthen my understanding of core data engineering concepts and system design.\n\nIn one system design, I proposed an architecture for a given scenario, explaining my choices and trade-offs. However, I found myself fielding rapid-fire questions like, “Why use X instead of Y?” or “Does that component really belong there?” While I’m still early in my data engineering journey, I’m approaching each intervw as a learning experience and refining how I communicate my thought process and technical reasoning under pressure. How can I get more experience with such a high barrier of entry? Is there any resources I can use to get better? I felt I didn’t even have a chance. I might even find SWE roles much easier to intervw for. ",

        "content": "I’m an ML Engineer working in a team where ML is new, and I’m collaborating with data engineers who are integrating model predictions into our data warehouse (DWH) for the first time.\n\nWe have a traditional DWH setup with raw, staging, source core, analytics core, and reporting layers. The analytics core is where different data sources are joined and modeled before being exposed to reporting.\n\nOur project involves two text classification models that predict two kinds of categories based on article text and metadata. These articles are often edited, and we might need to track both article versions and historical model predictions, besides of course saving the latest predictions. The predictions are ultimately needed in the reporting layer.\n\nThe data team proposed this workflow:\n\t1.\tAdd a new reporting-ml layer to stage model-ready inputs.\n\t2.\tRun ML models on that data.\n\t3.\tSend predictions back into the raw layer, allowing them to flow up through staging, source core, and analytics core, so that versioning and lineage are handled by the existing DWH logic.\n\nThis feels odd to me — pushing derived data (ML predictions) into the raw layer breaks the idea of it being “raw” external data. It also seems like unnecessary overhead to send predictions through all the layers just to reach reporting. Moreover, the suggestion seems to break the unidirectional flow of the current architecture. Finally, I feel some of these things like prediction versioning could or should be handled by a feature store or similar. \n\nIs this a good approach? What are the best practices for integrating ML predictions into traditional data warehouse architectures — especially when you need versioning and auditability?\n\nWould love advice or examples from folks who’ve done this.",

For this run, we were using a g.8x with 2 workers.\n\nThis job took 1 hour 14, and 30 minutes of the job were between 2 jobs. A GlueParquetHadoopWriter and rdd at DynamicFrame.\n\nI am trying to optimize these two tasks so i can reduce the job run time.\n\nMy current theory is that we convert our spark dataframe to a dynamic frame so that we can write partitions out to our glue tables. I think this step is the rdd at Dynamic Frame job, i think its shuffling(?) to a rdd.\n\nThe second job i think is the writes to s3, this being the GlueParquetHadoopWriter. Currently if we run this job for multiple days, we have to write out partitions at the day level, which i think makes the writes take longer. Example if we run for \\~2 months, we have to partition the data to day level then write it out to s3 (60\\~ partitions).\n\nIm struggling to come up with solutions on how to increase the write speed, we need the data in this partition structure for downstream so we are pretty locked. Would writing out bulk and having another job pick the file up to repartition it be faster? My mind thinks this just means we would then pay for cold start costs twice and get no real benefit.\n\nInterested to hear ideas people have on diagnosing/speeding up these tasks!  \nThanks\n\n[jobs](https://preview.redd.it/2z9pmg5g190f1.png?width=1606&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc8480896d249246e1096773d51b80c06a8c01ea)\n\n[breakdown of GlueParquetHadoopWriter](https://preview.redd.it/l9tptrco190f1.png?width=1610&format=png&auto=webp&s=b59c6fb4de7b620827a6fc531c2f3321f0517209)\n\n[tasks of GlueParquetHadoopWriter](https://preview.redd.it/ycpusb9u190f1.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b70e98729b8e6495458d27dfe551f4c458b65b)\n\n",

        "content": "**Hi,**\n\nAs the title suggests, I’d like to learn what a data engineer’s workday really looks like. If you’re not interested in my context and motivation, feel free to skip the paragraph below and go straight to describing your day – whether by following my guiding questions or just sharing your own perspective freely.\n\nI’ve tagged this post with *career* because I’m currently in the process of applying for data engineering positions. I’ve become particularly interested in working with data in cloud environments – in the past, I’ve worked with SQL databases and also had some exposure to OLAP systems. To prepare for this role, I’ve completed several courses and built a few non-commercial projects using cloud services such as Databricks, ADF, SQL DB, DevOps, etc.\n\nRight now, I’m applying for Cloud Data Engineer positions in Azure, especially those related to ETL/ELT. I’d like to understand what everyday work in commercial projects actually looks like, so I can better prepare for interviews and get a clearer sense of what employers mean when they talk about “commercial experience.” This post is mainly addressed to those who already work in such roles.\n\nHere are some optional guiding questions (feel free to use them or just describe things your way):\n\n* What does a typical workday look like for a data engineer working with ETL/ELT tools in the cloud (Azure/GCP/AWS – mainly Data Services like Databricks, Spark, Virtual Machines, ADF, ADLS, SQL Database, Synapse, etc.)?\n* What kind of tasks do you receive? How do you approach them and how much time do they usually take?\n* How would you classify tasks as easy, medium, or advanced in terms of difficulty – could you give examples?\n* Could you describe the context of your current project?\n* Do you often use documentation and AI? What is the attitude toward AI in your team and among your managers?\n* What do you do when you face a problem you can’t immediately solve? What does team communication look like in such cases?\n* Do you take part in designing the architecture and integrating services?\n* What does the lifecycle of a task look like?\n* How do you usually communicate – is it constant interaction or more asynchronous work, e.g. through Git?\n\nI hope I managed to express clearly what I’m looking for. I also hope this post helps not only me but other aspiring data engineers as well. Looking forward to hearing from you!\n\nI’ll be truly grateful for any response – whether it’s a detailed description of your workday or more general advice and reflections.",

It's \\~2 dozen azure SQL databases, none huge at all by modern standards.  But they do have a LOT of tables and the transformation needs aren't trivial.   And whatever we build needs to be deployable to additional instances with similar source db's ideally using some automated approach.  I.e. don't want to build manually or by hand the same thing for all \\~15-20 customer instances.\n\nAt this point I just need to put together a matrix of options running from \"write some python and do it manually\", to \"use parameterized data factory jobs\", to \"just buy a tool\".  ADF looks a bit expensive IMO, although I don't have a ton of experience with it.  \n\nAnybody been through a similar process recently?  When does an expensive ETL tool become \"worth it\"?  And how to sell that value when you know the pressure coming will be \"but it's free to just write python code\".  ",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm a student/employee at a governmental banking institution. My contract is due to end in November of this year at which point I'll graduate and be on the job market. My work so far has been scripting in Python to aggregate data and deliver it to my supervisor who does business specific analytics in Excel. I export data from SAP Business Objects and run a Python solution on it that does all of the cleaning, aggregations and delivers multiple csv files of which only two are actively used in Excel for dashboarding.\n\nWe've had problems with documentation of the upstream data that had us waste a lot of time finding the right people to explain some of the things we needed to access to do what we do. So my supervisor wants us to have a suitable, structured way of documenting our work to contribute to the enhancement of the state of Data Cataloguing at our firm.\n\nOn the other hand, I haven't felt satisfied in what I've been doing so far, 7 months into the work. My motivation has declined slowly and it's quite obvious that my relationship with my supervisor has suffered from it (lack of communication, not much work on the table, etc...). I would like to change this reality and give myself the opportunity to show that I could be more of use if I'm put to work on the technical aspects more so than following the trail of my supervisor on the business oriented work. I understand that I must ultimately be in service of the business goals but as explained above, doing Python scripting on excel and csv files then letting him do the dashboarding in Excel while I sit back and wait for another need to be done isn't very fulfilling on all levels (academically, I need to showcase how I used my technical expertise in DE. Professionally, I need to show that I worked on designing, implementing and maintaining robust data pipelines. The job market is hard enough as it is for the freshly graduated, not having any actual work under my belt on some of the widely used technologies in the field of DE)\n\nEventually, the hope is to suggest a data pipeline to replace what we've been doing so far. Instead of exporting csv and excel from SAP Business Objects, loading in them in Python, doing transformations in Python, then exporting csv and excel files for the supervisor to load them using Power Query in Excel and do his dashboarding there I suggest the following:  \n\\- Exporting from SAP BO and immediately loading into an Object Storage System, I have experience with MinIO.  \n\\- Ingesting data from the files into PostgreSQL as a Data Warehouse.  \n\\- Using DBT+Python to do the Transformations & Quality Control (Is it possible to only use DBT to preprocess the data, i.e remove duplicate rows, clean up columns, build new columns? I do these in Python already)  \n\\- Using a different tool for BI (I worked with PowerBI & Metabase before)  \n\\- Finally, a Data Catalog to document everything we're doing. I have experience with Datahub but my company uses Informatica Axon and I don't have access to ingesting any metadata or adding any data sources.\n\nI appreciate anyone who read my lengthy post and suggested their opinion on what I should do and how I should go about this. It's a really good company to work at (from a salary and reputation pov) so having a few years here under my belt after graduating would help my career significantly but I need to be of use to them for this.",

But in my experience this kind of environment is less demanding in terms of responsibility, so I could start getting too comfortable.\n\nWhich one would you choose?

Because we already worked with csv-files for persistence, I want to do my current task using an embedded sqlite-database. But unlike the csv-file approach that I completed, there's a problem with database.\n\nThe task is to make a small checkout for sales. The following models are needed\n\nProducttype  \nProduct ; has a Produkttype  \nLineItem ; has a Product  \nSale ; has a List of LineItems\n\nWhere in the version of my task, where I used csv-files, it just saved Sales and thats it, a database will now cause a problem.\n\nI have a Product that references a Typ, a LineItem will reference a Product, a Sale references a List of LineItems.\n\nBut a Sale is a one time event. So the \"history\" of Sales saved in the database shouldn't be able to be changed afterwards. But with a normalized database, when I someday change the price of a product, all the sales will also change, because of using references.\n\nMy thoughts of possible solutions\n\n1 - Data Historization  \nI could copy all referenced data into an archive table, when an entity is about to be changed and change all referenced from the product to its archived version.\n\n2 - Product versioning  \nBasically the same as 1 but I have only one table and an extra attribute \"Version\" and everytime I change something the Version goes up, and the GUI will only fetch the ones with the highest version, while Sales reference the versions they were created with.\n\n3 - Denormalization  \nWe were taught to normalize, but I also read that if needed, it's better to denormalize for simplicity instead of making everything super complicated to maybe save a bit of performance. By that I mean, I create a column for every attribute and save it directly in the Sales table. But that means this could in theory lead to infinite columns over a long enough time.\n\nSo which option, or maybe a completely different one, is the goto method to solve this problem?

        "author": "travel_through_r",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi! I'm new here, so sorry in advance if I broke some rule.\n\nAnyway... During high school, I learned procedural programming (C++), basics of data structures, computer architecture... and as a result, I think I've become somewhat skilled in solving algorithmic tasks.\n\nNow at university, I started with object oriented programming (mostly C++ again) and I think that I understand all the basics (classes and objects, constructors/destructors, fields/methods, inheritance...) while all my professors swear that this approach is far better than procedural programming which I used to do (they mostly cite code reusability and security as reason why).\n\nThe problem is that, even though I already did dozens of, mostly small sized, object oriented programs so far, I still don't see any benefits of it. In fact, it would be easier to me to just make procedural programs while not having to think about object oriented decomposition and stuff like that. Also, so far I haven't see any reason to use inheritance/polymorphism.\n\nThe \"biggest\" project I did until now is assembler that reads contents of a file with assembly commands and translates it to binary code (I created classes Assembler, SymbolTable, Command... but I could have maybe even easier achieve the same result with procedural approach by simply making structures and global functions that work with instances of those structures).\n\nSo, my question is: **can someone explain me in simple terms what are the benefits of object oriented programming and when should I use it?**\n\nTo potentially make things easier to explain and better understand the differences, I even made a small example of a program done with both approaches.\n\nSo, lets say, you need to create a program \"ObjectParser\" where user can choose to parse and save input strings with some predefined form (every string represents one object and its attributes) or to access already parsed one.\n\nNow, let's compare the two paradigms:\n\n**1. Procedural:**\n\n\\- First you would need to define some custom structure to represent object:\n\n    struct Object {\n      // fields\n    }\n\n\\- Since global variables are considered a bad practice, in main method you should create a map to store parsed objects:\n\n    std::map<string, Object> objects;\n\n\\- Then you should create one function to parse a string from a file (user enters name of a file) and one to access an attribute of a saved object (user provides name of the object and name of the attribute)\n\n    void parseString(std::map<string, Object>& objects, std::string filename) {\n      // parsing and storing the string\n    }\n    std::string getValue(std::map<string, Object>& objects, std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) {\n      // retrieving the stored object's attribute\n    }\n\n\\* Notice that you need to pass the map to function since it's not a global object\n\n\\- Then you write the rest of the main method to get user input in a loop (user chooses to either parse new or retrieve saved object)\n\n**2. Object oriented**\n\n\\- First you would create a class called Parser and inside the private section of that class define structure or class called Object (you can also define this class outside, but since we will only be using it inside Parser class it makes sense that it's the integral part of it).\n\nOne of the private fields would be a map of objects and it will have two public methods, one for parsing a new string and one to retrieve an attribute of already saved one.\n\n    class Parser {\n    \n      public:\n        void parseString(std::string filename) {\n          // parsing and storing the string\n        }\n        std::string getValue(std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) {\n          // retrieving the stored object's attribute\n        }\n    \n      private:\n        struct Object {\n          // fields\n          Object(...) {\n            // Object constructor body\n          }\n        }\n        std::map<string, Object> objects;\n    }\n\n\\* Notice that we use default \"empty\" constructor since the custom one is not needed in this case.\n\n\\- Then you need to create a main method which will instantiate the Parser and use than instance to parse strings or retrieve attributes after getting user input the same way as in the procedural example.\n\n**Discussing the example:**\n\nCorrect me if I wrong, but I think that both of these would work and it's how you usually make procedural and object oriented programs respectively.\n\nNow, except for the fact that in the first example you need to pass the  map as an argument (which is only a slight inconvenience) I don't see why the second approach is better, **so if it's easier for you to explain it by using this example or modified version of it, feel free to do it.**\n\n**IMPORTANT**: This is not, by any means, an attempt to belittle object oriented programming or to say that other paradigms are superior. I'm still a beginner, who is trying to grasp its benefits (probably because I'm yet to make any large scale application).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\n**Edit**: Ok, as some of you pointed out, even in my \"procedural\" example I'm using std::string and std::map (internally implemented in OOP manner), so both examples are actually object oriented. \n\nFor the sake of the argument, lets say that instead of std::string I use an array of characters while when it comes to std::map it's an instance of another custom struct and a bunch of functions to modify it (now when I think about it, combining all this into a logical unit \"map\" is an argument in favor of OOP by itself).

I don’t want to just copy code, I want to really understand it, and become confident organising and building real projects.\n\n**So my question is: how do you actually learn and retain this stuff as a real developer?**\n\nAppreciate any insights, tips, or honest experiences 🙏",

I looked through all the rules and terms before I took it, and there was not one direct mention of whether reading documentation or looking things up was fair game or not. From their other rules, it seemed to potentially imply that they only wanted one window/tab open, so I went into this test with no resources.\n\nSuffice it to say, it didn't go so well. It was in JavaScript, which I was learning at the time, and the most important question on the test relied heavily on JavaScript string methods, which I have never memorized (even Python or Java string methods, I'll generally look up).\n\nSo my question: Does knowing string methods off the top of your head indicate that you are a good programmer? Since you have had so much experience programming that it's trivial to remember and use them? I figure that in the real world, methods, libraries, etc., can always be looked up, so I don't typically set aside storage space in my brain to remember all of them. Should I devote more attention to this?",

        "author": "TemperatureStandard6",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I was a math/CS major in college, and afterwards worked for two years as a software engineer (in Java/SQL). I then switched careers and spent the next 25 years successfully doing something completely unrelated, writing code only extremely occasionally in essentially \"toy\" environments (e.g., simple Basic code in Excel to automate some processes). \n\nIn the meantime, I sort of missed \"real\" coding, but not enough to switch back careers, and I completely missed all the developments that happened during those 25 years, in terms of tooling, frameworks, etc. Back when I was coding, there was no GitHub, Stack Overflow, Golang, React, cloud, Kubernetes, Microservices, etc., and even Python wasn't really a thing (it existed, but almost nobody was using it seriously in production). \n\nI now have an idea for an exciting (and fairly complex) project, and enough time and flexibility (and fire in the belly) to build it myself - at least the initial version to see if the idea has legs before involving other people. Haven't had such an itch to code in 25 years :) So my question is - what is the fastest and most efficient way to learn the modern \"developer stack\" and current frameworks, both to start building quickly and at the same time make sure that whatever I do is consistent with modern best practices and available frameworks? The project will involve a big database on the backend, with a Web client on the frontend, and whatever is available through the Web client would also need to be available via an API. For the initial version, of course I don't need it to support many requests at the same time, but I do want to architect it in a way that it could potentially support a huge number of concurrent requests/be essentially infinitely scalable. \n\nI'm not sure where to start \"catching up\" on the entire stack - from tools like Cursor and GitHub to Web frameworks like React to backend stuff - and I am also a bit worried that there are things \"I don't know that I don't know\" (with the things I mentioned, at least I know they exist and roughly understand what they do, but I am worried about \"blind spots\" I may have). There is of course a huge amount of material online, but most of what I found is either super specific and assumes a lot of background knowledge about that particular technology, OR the opposite, it assumes no knowledge of programming at all, and starts out with \"for\" loops and such and moves painfully slowly. I would very much appreciate any suggestions on the above (or any parts of the above) that would help me catch up quickly (obviously not to the expert level on any of these, but to a \"workable\" one) and start building. Thank you so much!",

The problem lies in not entirely understanding wtf I'm doing or why. \n\nThe issue? I basically asked GPT to help me think of a project that was out of my scope. I normally don't use AI at all, trying to learn everything myself, only asking small questions when i get stuck for too long. \n\nBut this project was kind of.. perfect? It showed how weak i was in certain areas, and I've been learning to fill the gaps.\n\nThe issue is that I've been unwell, and every time i jump back into this project, i feel overwhelmed and spend more time remembering what i was doing, than actually doing anything. \n\nHowever I've already begun adding it on github, and i feel like, as a resume-project, it may look a little bad that i started it, and paused for a couple weeks?\n\nSo I'm not sure what to do, either i force myself to cram and finish it, even just a super basic version. \n\nOr i put the entire project on hold, finish something a little smaller, to add to github, and then go back to it. \n\nI just.. feel stuck, overwhelmed, and not sure if i should just scrap it entirely tbh.

I simply cannot wrap my head around the syntax of declarative programming since what I have been learning  is imperative. \n\nEverywhere i look online shows basic examples of it like \"lst = \\[x\\*2 for x in lst\\]\" and there are no examples of more complex code, e.g. nested loops or branching. On top of this, everywhere that mentions declarative programming they all say that you should not update values throughout the lifespan of the program but that is quite literally impossible. I have spoken to my teacher multiple times and joined several support sessions but i still have no clue how to program declaratively. I understand that i need to \"say what result i want, not how to get to it\" but you still write code in a specific syntax which was simply not exposed to us at a high enough lvl to be able to go and write a small program. \n\nPlease help, thanks.",

I constantly have to have a reference open on my computer to help me remember syntax.  Here's an example:  Lets say I'm building a class.  I would need to have something like this open to help me remember syntax: \n\npublic class MediaItem { \n\n// Properties common to all media items \n\npublic string Title \n\n{ get; set; } \n\npublic int PublicationYear \n\n{ get; set; } \n\n// Constructor for the base class public \n\nMediaItem(string title, int publicationYear) \n\n{ \n\nTitle = title; PublicationYear = publicationYear; Console.WriteLine(\"MediaItem constructor called.\"); } \n\n// A virtual method that can be overridden by derived classes \n\npublic virtual void DisplayInfo() \n\n{ \n\nConsole.WriteLine($\"Title: {Title}\"); Console.WriteLine($\"Publication Year: {PublicationYear}\"); \n\n}\n\nI would need to have this open in OneNote so I can reference because my memory is so terrible.  Is this a bad practice?  Is this a normal problem?  Obviously, I know it will get better with repetition, but it is very frustrating.  ",

Actually, Java is the first OOP language I'm learning at the moment.\nAs for the hardest part for me, it's how to structure a program. I know how I would build a TicTacToe in C or Python, but I have no idea how to translate all that into implementing the use of classes and objects.\n\nHi everyone! I'm a programming student since 2020 and I went through a lot of languages that I loved and hated, but nothing was like Java.\n\nRecently, due to a Software Engineering course in my university, I had to start using Java and it's so so so difficult to me. Even a simple tic tac toe game it's difficult and I can't understand why.\n\nIn the past, when I didn't understand something I always relied on YT videos and tutorials, but for Java I can't find any of that. No one who really explains how to start and finish a project or what are the good practices to follow.\n\nIs there anyone who has ever been in my situation and wants to advise me on how to proceed?",

        "content": "I’m sharing this experience as context for the title.\n\nI've been learning Python fundamentals, and one of the topics I recently explored was working with dictionaries and lists. Yesterday, I started building a simple contact book that uses these structures. The idea was for the program to ask the user how many contacts they'd like to add, and then prompt for each contact’s name, phone number, and email. The goal was to use the name as the key in a dictionary, with the corresponding phone number and email grouped as the value. It also needed to support adding, editing, and deleting contacts.\n\nI spent two days stuck on how to cleanly structure this. I figured out how to loop based on the number of contacts entered, but I couldn’t wrap my head around how to group the 2 pieces of information (phone number, email) in a nested way that made sense for a dictionary with the name as Key. After some Googling, I discovered that you could, in one line, create a dictionary with a nested dictionary inside of it.\n\n    .update({x: {y: z}})\n\nWhere x is the name, y is the phone number, and z is the email.\n\nI felt a bit guilty for not figuring that out on my own. I had tried using a separate dictionary for the values and updating the main contact dictionary with it, but the results were messy. Either older contacts got overwritten, or duplicated data would be printed.\n\nAll of that to say, I’m wondering if this was one of those learning moments where I should’ve pushed through on my own a bit longer instead of looking it up. Where do I draw the line?",

My focus is on mastering both core CS concepts and practical skills. I want a clear, efficient roadmap that covers fundamental topics, hands-on coding, and system design — essentially the skills expected in a CS job, even if I don't plan to apply for one.  \n\nHere's my current plan:  \n\n1. Core CS Fundamentals: Study algorithms, data structures, operating systems, networks, databases, and computer architecture.  \n2. Programming Proficiency: Deeply learn one or two programming languages (considering Python and JavaScript/TypeScript).  \n3. Project Development: Build real-world applications (web and backend) and contribute to open-source projects.  \n4. System Design: Learn scalable architecture principles, database management, and cloud deployment.  \n\nI'll use a mix of free online courses (like CS50, MIT OCW, The Odin Project, and freeCodeCamp) alongside other online resources.  \n\n### My Questions:\n- Is this roadmap practical? What changes or additions would you recommend?\n- What are the best, up-to-date resources for self-learning computer science (e.g., YouTube channels, blogs, creators, platforms)?\n- Given the current trends of vibe coding, what can self-learners prioritize or skip?\n- Any vibe coding tools to recommend?\n- What common mistakes should self-learners in CS avoid?\n\nI'd love to hear from anyone who has successfully self-studied CS or has experience in the field.

After using PyInstaller Extractor, I was left with a folder containing several .pyc files and a .pyz subfolder containing an extensive Python directory. I’m pretty sure I found the specific .pyc file that does what I’m looking for, but there are a lot of additional .pyc files in that directory that I’m struggling to understand the purpose of. The folder that contained the .pyc files and the .pyz directory looks like it mostly has initialization and compatibility code snippets, (the application references several .pyd and .dll files so I assume this is mostly related to compatibility between Python code and a windows executable file) but I’m not sure I understand why the meat and potatoes are all in a subfolder.\n\n",

From this process I have noticed that the current \"industry standard\" meet management software leaves a bit to be desired and is exorbitantly expensive.

In the end (end likely means a matter of years as this is a side project/hobby), I would like to create something similar (an alternative to) *Hy-Tek Meet Manager For Swimming*. It does not have to be fully featured just to learn. This program runs on a database and tracks swimmers, events, and entries. It also has more advanced features including implementation with timing consoles and the sort, but I am currently not concerned with this. \n\n**My Question**\n\nWhat might be some coding languages/applications I would want to learn to approach a program like this? I am assuming I would need some form of database back end with a gui on the front. \n\n  \nWhere should I start? I would prefer not to take true college classes or anything like that.

Not necessarily an amazing offer in his words, but something. In the 2000s, he said it was a bit more competitive, but could land an offer for every 10 applications. \n\nEven in 2015, I found I could apply to 20 or 30 jobs and be relatively confident in getting an offer. Assuming I wasn't stretching myself, most jobs I was applied for I would get an interview for, even if we determined it wasn't a good fit.\n\nBut now I am regularly seeing people say you need to submit 100s to 1000s of applications to get a job. & applying to 100 jobs without getting past the screener.\n\nI feel like the ladder has been pulled up & the hiring process has become fully kafkaesque. its a regular refrain here now that you can be the best applicant for the role and be filtered out by the ATS, it depends on your luck. this system seems designed to abuse people seeking work rather than find the best applicant. \n\nFor those of us who can take advantage of our professional networks, we might still find we only need to have 20 or 30 conversations with people to land our next role. Since we can get referrals or speak directly to hiring managers out of band.\n\nBut every publicly posted job getting +1000 applicants. If things continue at this rate we will soon see people saying we will need 10,000 or 100,000 job applications submitted in order to land a role. I don't know what the solution is but this just doesn't make sense and seems completely awful. turning the job market into a casino isn't helping employees or employers.",

        "content": "I’ve applied to thousands of jobs. I graduated 5 months ago from Berkeley. I have 2-3 internships under my belt, and a number of projects I’ve worked on since high school. Instead of just wasting away, I decided to build a project that I had enough faith could pan out as a startup, and I’m doing it. I got 120 users within 2 days of my first public market test. I’m building relentlessly, and I got interviews at two startups. Three other companies reached out to me. For the first time in months, I actually had hope. I felt like I had a shot. Yesterday, the startup that had the culture and the work I’ve always dreamed about working at rejected me. The other one ghosted me. Why? Not because I was bad, or because I failed the interview. They just wanted someone with more experience on their stack. \n\nAll those interview requests went the fuck away. \n\nI think that stung more than anything. I put in the work, so much work. I didn’t even fail through any fault of my own. \n\nI don’t know what I’m going to do. I really really don’t. Since that, I think I’ve actually applied to 145 apps in the past 2 days. I’ve reoptimized my resume 3 times in the past 2 days, which makes this my 30th iteration. I did everything I was supposed to do. \n\nI just want a job. I want to start my life. \n\nForgive me for feeling sorry for myself. I just needed to do that this once. I’ve been so stoic and determined for five months, and now I get it. ",

In the first recruiter call, they asked for my salary expectations. I asked for their range, as an example here, let’s say they said $150K–$180K. I said, “That works, I’m looking for something above $150K.” I think this was my first mistake, more on that later.\n\nI am a person with low self esteem(or serious imposter syndrome) and when I say I nailed all 8 rounds, I really must believe that. The recruiter followed up the day after 8th round saying team is interested in extending an offer. Then on compensation expectations the recruiter said, “You mentioned $150K earlier.” I clarified that I was targeting the upper end based on my fit and experience. They responded with, “So $180K?” and I just said yes. It felt a bit like putting words in my mouth.\n\nNext day, I got an email saying that I have to wait for the offer decision as they are interviewing  other candidates. Haven’t heard back since. I don’t think I did anything fundamentally wrong or if I should have regrets but curious what others think.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, in my mind I thought that’s how negotiations work. They will come back and say can’t do 150 but can do 140. But I guess not.",

However, I can’t help but notice how many people are not really doing what it takes, even in good market, to secure a decent job (ignore 2021-2022, those were anomalously good years, and likely won’t happen again in the near future).\n\n\nWhat I’ve seen:\n\n1. Not searching for internships the summer/fall *before* the summer you want to intern.  I literally had someone ask me IRL a few days ago, about my company’s intern program that literally starts next week…. They were focusing on schoolwork apparently in their fall semester , and started looking in the spring.\n\n2. Not applying for new grad roles in the same timeline as above.  Why did you wait to graduate before you seriously started the job search?  \n\n3.  Not having projects on your resume (assuming no work xp) because you haven’t taken the right classes yet or some other excuse.  Seriously?\n\n4.  Applying to like 100 roles online, and thinking there’s enough.  I went to a top target, and I sent over 1000 apps, attended so many in-person and virtual events, cold DMed people on LinkedIn for informational interviews starting my freshman year.  I’m seeing folks who don’t have the benefit of a target school name literally doing less.\n\n5.  Missing scheduled calls, show up late, not do basic stuff.  I had a student schedule an info interview with me, no show, apologize, reschedule, and no show again.   I’ve had others who had reached out for a coffee chat, not even review my LinkedIn profile and ask questions like where I worked before.  Seriously?\n\n6.  Can’t code your way out of a box.  Yes, a wild amount of folks can’t implement something like a basic binary search.\n\n7.  Cheat on interviews with AI.  It’s so common.\n\n8.  Not have basic knowledge/understanding (for specific roles).  You’d be surprised how many candidates in AI/ML literally don’t know the difference between inference and training, or can’t even half-explain the bias-variance trade-off problem.\n\n\nDo the basic stuff right, and you’re already ahead of 95% of candidates.\n\n",

I am the best at building front ends, but apparently I'm not the best at figuring out wordle edge cases while people with half my experience stare me.\n\nIf you are in college for CS, I cannot tell you strongly enough to change your major to business. You're going to put in thousands of applications even when you have a decade of experience and you will have to go through endless interview rounds. Even when you are in demand, you will still need to jump through these endless hoops where people ask you completely useless facts and then smirk at you when you don't figure out the specific edge cases in the worldle app the made you code.\n\nPlease do not respond to this by saying \"well that's just because it takes 5 interviews to tell whose a good software engineer.\" It doesn't. Software engineering is like any other profession, we do not need these endless tests.\n\nI feel like I am going crazy and seriously thinking about leaving the industry for one with an actual sane interview process. I've been doing this for seven months and I seriously am at the point where I am crying and exhauswted and have ptsd from these endless interviews!\n\nIf you are in college for cs, change your major to business or some other type of engineering or literally anything! Don't subject yourself to this awful dumpster fire of a process that will only get worse.\n\nEdit: Guys it's not that I'm failing the processes, I'm doing as well as everybody else and don't need advice. I can do sliding windows and depth first searches off the cuff. I'm exhausted because unlike in the first seven years of my career, people have started to have 5 interviews on average, *including* coding tests. If everybody had reasonable hiring processes *like they used to* I would not be as angry even if I were failing them, because at least then I could move on quickly.\n\nEdit 2: I am not asking to do away with coding interviews. I think they're dumb but people have been complaining about them for a decade so I understand why companies do them. I'm asking to do away with these ridiculous processes that are 5 rounds *on average* and go back to have 1) a screening call 2) an onsite, 3) and then a reference check, a process which ANY REASONABLE COMPANY should be able to evaluate an employee. Sure ask our coding questions in the onsite, but my god. I interview with startups, who fail thirty percent more often then regular businesses. Every single of one of those failing businesses had elaborate hiring processes. Startup failure rates are blazingly high, 30 percent higher than other small businesses, because they do things like these stupid elaborate hiring processes.",

Then he asked - When can you join - I told him, give me 2 weeks to think about it, the CEO said No, give me an early response. Then the CTO told him to atleast tell me about the company. Then he talked about the company. After it, I was desperate so I joined it.\n\nFirst day - They didn't even gave me any offer letter, just onboarded me on their payroll system, they didn't even gave me company laptops. So I started the day at 10 am, get every system access(github, backend) access around 11am-12 pm, they have already assigned me a ticket. Around 3 pm, the CTO asked me whether I am done, which I said No because they have hired me as an AI engineer position and their work/tickets assigned were for backend development. Then CEO came around 5 pm, started asking me whether I am done, then he further asked me around 7 pm- How much percentage I am done of the first ticket. I was really exhausted after 7:30 pm so I left, the ticket was still assigned. Also, second ticket was also assigned around nighttime to me.\n\nMeanwhile, at the same night, he called the other developer and asked him- How was my performance on the first day.\n\nI thought a bit at the same night, and then I told them I can't work there. All of my friends are saying that I should have stayed there, and I am behaving like an entitled Gen-Z and startups are run like this only and I should have collected atleast few paychecks. According to me, working there would have impacted my psyche negatively, and wasted my time which I could have utilised applying elsewhere.\n\nBut am I over-reacting, am I a weak-willed person or was I correct in judging it.\n\np.s - Office was in open areas of WeWork.",

As a result, it seems like the amount of work expected to be completed has sharply increased—and ironically enough—the job has gotten more stressful.\n\nI used to be assigned several stories per sprint, and could finish them with ample time, all while learning something too. However recently it has felt like since management knows about how AI is, they load us up on our sprints, where I'm getting double the amount of tickets as I was before, and even junior developers are leading entire initiatives of our project, and they too have voiced feelings of intense pressure.\n\nAs a result of this, I'm starting to feel like my love of programming and problem-solving is dwindling. Each ticket I hardly have the time to truly think about solutions and research and learn, because I'm expected to use AI to grind out the solution and move onto the next. This has made me feel like I'm burning out a bit, because instead of learning things I feel more like a prompt engineer at most and just gluing solutions together and moving onto the next ticket, with little time for anything else because the work volume has drastically increased.\n\nWas wondering if anyone else has had feelings similar to this? Any advice? Would be greatly appreciated, thanks! ",

        "content": "I'm a junior with 2.5 YOE. It took me almost 9 months to get my first job because of how bad the market was (is) when I graduated. I got my current and first job because I was cheap (my starting pay was far below market rate for SE1 role), and the hiring manager was impressed with a systems programming and os architecture project I had on my resume and my github from one of my classes which was written in C. My job uses a techstack of syncfusion c# winform frontend and an old C backend that was originally written before I was even born.\n\nI've been spending my free time upskilling, mostly working with .net core & react, and python as I'd like to get a full stack or backend role with a more modern and common techstack. But problem is, every job I've applied to that uses anything remotely modern hasn't given me any call backs. The only jobs I have heard from are ones that I didn't even apply to that want the same thing as my current job does, a cheap junior that knows C.\n\nI'm guessing part of the reason why I'm not getting callbacks is not just because of how bad the market is, but because in a recruiters and hiring manager's mind, why take a chance on someone who currently works with something arachic, when you can just get someone who has actual job experience in what they use. How do I get out of being pigeonholed? I tailor my resume to the job I apply to as best I can, but it's not like I can rewrite the experience section of my resume that shows I deal with winforms and C.",

Every word that came out of his mouth was filtered through a layer of buzzwords and asskissing to the point i had to mute my audio while he's talking. I counted down the day before he left and thought that was the end of it. The first workday of the new year is when our boss announced that this intern would be returning fulltime. \n\nMy first issue with him was when i refactored a file in our codebase that he was also working on. He released a PR that undid everything i fixed in my refactor, but i was patient and told him when there are merge conflicts it's expected to meet with the other author to resolve it together. This happened just before i took a week of PTO and where i returned to find he blindly pushed his PR overwritting all my changes. My refactor got deprioritized for a couple weeks, but i finally got to remaking my changes only for him to try and do the same thing before being caught by another developer. \n\nAt first all my complaints about him were about his personality, but after seeing more of his pull requests its become obvious he doesn't know how to code and is just copy/pasting AI responses without any thought as long as they accomplish the job. Our job gave every developer a Microsoft CoPilot license, which i also use to help get out of roadblocks, but reviewing his PRs is basically just rewritting AI slop.",

Things that would require me some time to understand, are at my fingertips. I can make a whole project required by my teacher and make it even better than is required, but with AI. Without it I’d have to spend like 4x time to learn things first, but when AI responds with ready code, I understand it, but it would take a lot of time for me to code it ‘that’ way.\n\nI enjoy it anyway and spend dozens of hours on projects with AI. I can do a lot with it while understanding the code but not that much without it.\n\nWhat is world’s take on this? How it looks like in corporations? Do they still require us to code something at interviews? Will this make me a bad coder?",

The problem is that I hear the market is super competitive now so I'm not sure if its worth investing the time into getting back into interview shape. I'm also worried about burnout, since I am fully remote here and usually only go in-office twice a week for food. Big companies seem to be hard pushing RTO and I would miss being able to take work-cations around the world.\n\nWith all that being said, do you guys think its the right career move to make the jump? I've been here since graduating almost 5 years ago and am starting to feel a bit stagnant. It's like golden handcuffs except instead of good TC the carrot is just a relaxed schedule and remote option which seems to be dwindling. Those of you who have made the transition from startups to big tech, was it difficult to get interviews and offers? Did you think it was the right move career-wise?",

A couple years later I decided to switch careers, so I went back to school to study Computer Science. A bunch of my credits were transferred, so I finished the CS degree in 3 semesters with a 4.0 GPA and graduated in 2020. \n\nSince then… nothing. I’ve been applying for dev jobs ever since but haven’t been able to land a single proper interview. I didn’t do any internships because I didn’t know the job market would be this bad which I regret right now. I couldn’t afford to sit around waiting, so I’ve been working full-time in sales to pay the bills which makes it a bit harder for me since I don’t have a lot of free time to focus on job hunting and building projects.\n\nThat said, I didn’t give up on tech. I’ve been learning on my own, building personal projects whenever I have a bit of free time, and I’ve also worked with a small agency on a project basis (not full-time) since late 2023.\n\nAt this point I’m honestly burnt out and confused. Is it my resume? My background? Is the market just that bad? I’d really appreciate any advice or feedback, especially from anyone who broke in after a similar detour.",

I'm used to living very frugally and have enough savings, and not many medical bills, so would it be crazy to quit my job to better spend my time gaining skills I actually want to use in my career? I would probably get a part-time job in the meantime to help myself but not take so much of my time. Thinking about this since I don't want to get stuck deeper into a career that I loathe - I am quite miserable albeit financially secure, and leveling up in an area of my interest is more important to me than money beyond basic survival.

I’m currently trying to figure out what kind of environment I actually want to work in long term.\n\nIn particular, how normal is it to see these patterns? I’ve noticed these either as an intern or through reviews online for other startups:\n\n* Long hours: e.g. 10-12 hours a day, 5-7 days a week. Sometimes explicitly stated as part of the culture, other times unstated but clearly expected - people work late, on weekends, etc.\n* Leadership doesn’t take accountability: when things go wrong, there's no clear ownership from the top. Just a vague sense of we all failed together.\n* Strict in-office requirement: 5+ days a week in-office, with little or no flexibility for WFH.\n* Constantly shifting direction or pivoting: roadmaps or priorities changing multiple times a month, with work frequently thrown away.\n* Unstable policies: things like compensation, time-off policies, or promised benefits being changed or walked back\n* No mentorship: you're expected to figure things out mostly on your own, even as a junior or new hire.\n\nI get that startups are fast-paced, ambiguous, and scrappy, that’s kind of the appeal in some ways. But when several of these things combine, it’s hard to tell if that’s just startup life or if it’s a genuinely unhealthy environment, especially when you're early in your career.\n\nSo how many of these are just part of the deal when working at an early-stage company? And how many should be treated as signs to walk away?\n\nWould really appreciate any thoughts, heuristics, or personal experience. I’m trying to understand how to tell the difference between healthy chaos and exploitation / red flags to walk away from.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi folks, I'm a junior dev currently a year into their first job at a well-known tech company (non-FAANG) in the bay.\n\n**((This part is  just me ranting so you can just skip to the bottom to read my questions))**\n\nI know I should be grateful to have a job in this economy, but I am absolutely miserable at work due to various factors (uninteresting work, long hours, toxic team, micromanaging etc.) and I feel that I've hit the lowest point of my mental and physical health. I've lost at least 15 lbs due to lack of appetite from stress. Everyone in my team works \\~50 hours every week. Maybe these aren't \"crazy\" hours, but I joined the company expecting a regular 40 hour work week, so I was unpleasantly surprised. I used to be of the mindset that I just needed to work my 9-5 and leave,  but my manager actually reprimanded me specifically for not working long enough hours and being slow on my tasks only couple months into the job. I'd say this is when I started becoming very unhappy at my job as I became extremely anxious about my work hours and performances afterwards.\n\nAll of my coworkers are much *much* older than me. And while most people have been pleasant to work with, I have also been thrown under the bus by my manager over a minor issue that was not my fault because one of the senior members of the team took a disliking of me. This happened \\~5 months into the job. I'd say I'm on good terms with everyone now, but this left a very sour taste in my mouth. Also, the vast majority of my team consists of first-gen immigrants who speak to each other in a foreign language that I do not understand at work. This, combined with the fact that I'm the only junior in my team, makes me feel very out of place.\n\nI still plan on staying here for at least for a year so that I could keep my sign-on, but I flirt with the idea of quitting without any backup plan if it comes to that, though I likely never will given the state of the economy (alternatively, get hit by a car on the way to work). The pay is on the lower end of the average for the bay area and I also got a rather low annual raise, which has been one of the final straws for me.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\nI know that the biggest issue right now is that the job market for any entry level SWE is very saturated. However, I'm also a bit confused on how to start applying for jobs as someone with a full-time work experience:\n\n* Which roles do I even apply for? Should I still be applying to New Grad roles? I've heard that 1 YOE is not much different from New Grad. Based on what I have seen, most job postings have been only for mid to senior level roles. There doesn't seem to be many entry level roles that are posted year round. A lot of generic SWE roles still require 2 to 3+ YOE in the description. Should I still shoot my shot regardless? Or would it just be a waste of time?\n* Is it okay for my resume to be similar to what I had from college (ie. work experience, college projects, and engineering-related extracurriculars) with just the addition of my work as a full time engineer?\n* If I switch jobs before my first promotion at the company, would this set me back a year in terms of promotion? But to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll even get promoted in this team since my manger seems to have a bad impression of me.",

Medical expenses, transportation expenses  my student loans, savings goals, the cost of my hobbies, the benefits offered, etc. Typically this comes out to something like 70k to 90k depending on the area. After applying to dozens of jobs I've gotten basically no callbacks. Are my salary expectations unreasonable or is my problem coming from somewhere else.",

I maintain middleware backend web services for my large finance company's mobile apps (mobile BFF architecture) in TypeScript. I've gotten good at TS, can implement whatever's given to me, the job's stable and secure. I'm fortunate in many ways.\n\nThe problem is... the architecture means I've got no experience with DBs. Not even ORMs. We don't really roll our own infra, rarely we'll change an IAC config file somewhere. No gRPC. No real system design skills to speak of. Node+TS on the backend is also a weird place to be in this market where companies want you to fit to a T, it's in the intersection of front and backend.\n\nWe basically get together, talk about the future states of some parts of the mobile app, get the data from downstream services and just add business logic so that our REST endpoints have XYZ fields. It's gotten too easy, I don't feel like I'm growing and I'm worried about the skills I have vs those I *should* have on paper. The current market is also making it hard to switch jobs to get more breadth/depth. I've been trying to upskill on the side by learning Spring & iOS but ofc real-life production issues are very different from projects.\n\nHonestly I feel like a fraud whenever I hear staff SWEs speak about architecture, system design, and tech challenges they face.

        "content": "I’m at a pretty stressful crossroads and could really use some guidance. I recently turned 30 and am struggling with the reality that I don’t have professional experience in my field. Most of my work has been tied to school projects, so my portfolio isn’t as strong as I’d like.\n\nWhile I don’t consider myself the best or smartest (sometimes I feel the exact opposite), I’ve always been quick to understand things. I’m good at breaking down complex problems, and I’ve received praise for it my entire life. However, discipline has always been a challenge for me. I’ve managed to get by relying on my intellect while doing far less work than I should have. But recently, I’ve started implementing good routines and becoming productive every day.\n\nI’m an international student in the U.S., working toward my master’s in Math with a concentration in Computer Science, and my bachelor’s degree was also in CS. All I need to do to graduate is submit my thesis. The pressure is mounting because my time to stay in the country is running out unless I secure a job soon. I’m actually being forced to start using my OPT (limited work eligibility) time to submit my thesis by December and graduate.\n\nI feel overwhelmed trying to figure out how to compete in the job market despite these challenges. For reference, I’m currently near Houston, Texas. So far, I’ve applied to fewer than 50 jobs. Most of the time, I don’t get responses - sometimes I get rejections - but I’ve never had an interview.\n\nFor those who have been in similar situations - or those who’ve successfully transitioned into a career without much experience - how did you do it? Can I make my school projects look more compelling to employers? Will they even look at them? Do I have a chance?\n\nI know that if I’m given an opportunity in a work environment, I’ll reach a high-performance level very quickly. I just don’t know how to show this potential to employers. I also can’t seem to get my resume under two pages.\n\nAny advice on networking (which I’ve struggled with as an introvert with few close friends), skill-building, or navigating job searches efficiently would be incredibly helpful.\n\nFinally, thank you whoever you are for taking the time to read this. I’m crossing my fingers for something that gives me hope - that I haven’t completely wasted my life and opportunity here. In the meantime, I'm making small victories, like finally maintaining a steady routine of working on my thesis and working on my resume/linkedIn/applying for jobs full-time.",

        "author": "Wonderful_Analyst_50",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I graduated college with a bachelors degree in computer science a while ago and ever since I’ve been living with my parents while doing delivery services like Instacart and uber eats to make money while I try to search for a job as a software engineer. As you can guess I haven’t really gotten anywhere with that. I even attended a software engineering bootcamp last year to try to bolster my resume (may not have been the smartest idea in hindsight but I enjoyed it and met some cool people so I don’t regret it) but still nothing. \n\nMy family is now trying to push me to apply for a masters program focusing on something like cybersecurity or biotech (which feels a little outside my comfort zone as I wasn’t great at biology) claiming the masters is the final piece I need to make it all come together. Honestly the thought of putting so much more time and money into a field that has had fruitless returns so far gives me a ton of anxiety and I don’t want to come out the other side of it multiple years from now tens of thousands of dollars in debt and be in the same position I’m in now. I was lucky enough that I could get my bachelors degree mostly for free due to my father’s VA benefits but I’d be too old to qualify for that once I get into a masters program so I’d be paying full price this time around. I also burned out pretty hard towards the end of my bachelors (partially due to Covid) and pretty much dragged myself across the finish line so the thought of going back after a few years away is pretty daunting.\n\nUltimately though I know I need to do something and I’m sick and tired of the position I’m in. I feel like I’ve put my life on hold for years trying to start it from the best position possible and I’m at a point where it just doesn’t feel viable anymore. Living with my parents for this long just doing deliveries and job applications every day has made me pretty depressed and I kind of just want to get a regular non-tech job, move out into an apartment with a friend, and figure out my life from there. At the same time though I feel like if a masters degree would genuinely be very useful in the long run, I’m being short sighted and years from now I’d regret not getting it. Especially considering my parents are willing to keep housing me while I go back to school so I’d probably be making my life more difficult by moving out instead, even if it would probably improve my mental health.\n\nI do genuinely enjoy coding and would consider myself pretty good at it, but I wouldn’t say I’m passionate about it or anything. I don’t really feel passionate about anything really, I kinda just want to have a good life making comfortable money and not hating my job. When I changed my major to computer science it seemed like a pretty straight shot, I enjoyed it more than my other classes, I was naturally very good at it, and there seemed to be a pretty direct path of internship (check) -> degree (check) -> high paying job (crash and burn). The market crash happened right before I graduated so I found it to be extremely unlucky timing and have pretty much been trying to play catch up ever since.\n\nBasically I’m just looking to see if anyone has any thoughts on the usefulness of a masters degree in the current market and if it would be a good use of my time and money or not. Or maybe even if there’s any CS related jobs I could get with my current degree that I may have overlooked so far (I’ve mainly been focusing on full stack development). Any advice is very appreciated.\n\n\nTLDR: I’m wondering if a masters degree is worth the time and money in this current tech market or if there are any other type of CS jobs I could get with my bachelors that are commonly overlooked. Or should I just cut my losses, find a non-tech job, move into an apartment with a friend, and try to figure out my life from there.",
