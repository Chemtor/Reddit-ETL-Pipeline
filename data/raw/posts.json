        "content": "TLDR; My company wants to replace our pipelines with some all-in-one “AI agent” platform\n\nI’m a lone data engineer in a mid-size retail/logistics company that runs SAP ERP (moving to HANA soon). Historically, every department pulled SAP data into Excel, calculated things manually, and got conflicting numbers. I was hired into a small analytics unit to centralize this. I’ve automated data pulls from SAP exports, APIs, scrapers, and built pipelines into SQL Server. It’s traceable, consistent, and used regularly.\n\nNow, our new CEO wants to “centralize everything” and “go AI-driven” by bringing in a no-name platform that offers:\n\n\\- Limited source connectors for a basic data lake/warehouse setup\n\n\\- A simple SQL interface + visualization tools\n\n\\- And the worst of it all: an AI agent PER DEPARTMENT\n\nEach department will have its own AI “instance” with manually provided business context. Example: “This is how finance defines tenure,” or “Sales counts revenue like this.” Then managers are supposed to just ask the AI for a metric, and it will generate SQL and return the result. Supposedly, this will replace 95–97% of reporting, instantly (and the CTO/CEO believe it).\n\nObviously, I’m extremely skeptical:\n\n\\- Even with perfect prompts and context, if the underlying data is inconsistent (e.g. rehire dates in free text, missing fields, label mismatches), the AI will silently get it wrong.\n\n\\- There’s no way to audit mistakes, so if a number looks off, it’s unclear who’s accountable. If a manager believes it, it may go unchallenged.\n\n\\- The answer to every flaw from them is: “the context was insufficient” or “you didn’t prompt it right.” That’s not sustainable or realistic\n\n\\- Also some people (probs including me) will have to manage and maintain all the departmental context logic, deal with messy results, and take the blame when AI gets it wrong.\n\n\\- Meanwhile, we already have a working, auditable, centralized system that could scale better with a real warehouse and a few more hires. They just don't want to hire a team or I have to convince them somehow (bc they think that this is a cheaper, more efficient alternative).\n\nI’m still relatively new in this company and I feel like I’m not taken seriously, but I want to push back before we go too far, I'll switch jobs probably soon anyway but I'm actually concerned about my team.\n\nHow do I convince the management that this is a bad idea?",

Even other teams commonly call us \"devs.\"\n\nThis has me wondering:\n\nIs this just common industry language?\n\nOr is it a sign that the data engineering role is being blended into general development work?\n\nDo you also feel that your work is viewed more like backend/dev work than a specialized data role?\n\n\nJust curious how others experience this.

I recently switched jobs and started a role at a company whose primary platform is Palantir Foundry - in all my years in data, I have yet to meet folks who are super well versed in Foundry or see companies hiring specifically for Foundry experience. Foundry seems powerful, but more of a niche walled garden that prioritizes low code/no code and where infrastructure is obfuscated. \n\nAdmittedly, I didn’t know much about Foundry when I jumped into this opportunity, but it seemed like a good upwards move for me. The company is in hyper growth mode, and the benefits are great. \n\nI’m wondering from others who may have experience whether or not my general skills will stagnate and if I’ll be less marketable in the future.? I plan to keep working on side projects that use more “common” orchestration + compute + storage stacks, but want thoughts from others. \n\n",

The field is heavily geared towards business objectives, with the primary goal being to enhance stakeholder profitibility. This is amplified by how much investment is funelled to the cloud monopolies.\n\nI'd to like my job to have a positive societal impact. Perhaps in one of these areas (though im open to other ideas)?\n\n- science/discovery\n- renewable sector\n- social mobility\n\nMy aproach so far has been: get as good as possible. That way, organisations that you'd want to work for, will want you to work for them. But, it would be better if i could focus my efforts. Perhaps by targeting specific tech stacks that are popular in the areas above. Or by making a lateral move (or step down) to something like an IoT engineer.\n\n\nAny thoughts/experiences would be appreciated :)",

There's a strong resistance to anything that might be seen as \"overhead\" like data orchestration,  basic testing, good modelling, single definitions for business logic, etc. Things like QA or proper reviews are not treated with much importance because the priority is speed, even though it's very obvious that our output as a team is often chaotic (and we end up in many \"emergency data request\" situations).\n\nThe problem is that the work we produce is often rushed and full of issues. We frequently ship dashboards or models that contain errors and don't scale. There's no real documentation or data lineage. And when things break, the fixes are usually quick patches rather than root cause fixes.\n\nIt's been wearing on me a little. I care a lot about doing things properly. I want to build things that are scalable, maintainable, and accurate. But I feel like I'm constantly fighting an uphill battle and I'm starting to burn out from caring too much when no one else seems to.\n\nIf you've ever been in a situation like this, how did you handle it?

Did you stay and try to change things over time or did you eventually leave?\n\nAny advice, even small things, would help.\n\nPS: I'm not a manager - just a humble analyst 😅\n\n",

This is not mentioned anywhere in the contract, and you get to know only after joining and paying the amount.\nWhen I asked why can’t I access and why is this not menioned in the contract, their response was, it is written in the contract what we offer, which is misleading. \nIn the initial calls before joining, they emphasized more on these courses as an highlight.\n\n- Had to ping multiple times to get a basic review on CV.\n\n- 1:1 session can only be scheduled twice with a coach. There are many students enrolled now, and very few coaches are available. Sometimes, the availability of the coaches is more than 2 weeks away.\n\n- Coaches and their teams response time is quite slow. Sometimes the coaches don’t even respond. Only 1:1 was a good experience.\n\n- Sometimes the group sessions gets cancelled with no prior information, and they provide no platform to check if the session will begin or not.\n\n- Job application process and their follow ups are below average. They did not follow the job location preference and where just randomly appling to any DE role irrespective of which level you belong to.\n\n- For the job applications, they initially showed a list of referrals supported, but were not using that during the application process. Had to intervene multiple times, and then only a few of those companies from the referral list were used. \n\n- Had to start applying on my own, as their job search process was not that reliable.\n\n————————————————————————\nOverall, except the 1:1 with the coaches, I felt there was no benefit. They take a hughe amount, instead taking multiple online DE courses would have been a better option.",

        "author": "Ok-Comfortable7656",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "TL;DR: I have 7 years of experience in data engineering. Just got laid off. Now I’m choosing between staying in my comfort zone (another data role) or jumping into a potential CTO position at a startup—where I’d have to learn the MERN stack from scratch. Torn between safety and opportunity.\n\nBackground:\nI’m 28 and have spent the last 7 years working primarily as a Cloud Data Engineer (most recently in a Lead role), with some Solutions Engineering work on the side. I got laid off last week and, while still processing that, two new paths have opened up. One’s predictable. The other’s risky but potentially career-changing.\n\nOption 1: Potential CTO role at a trading startup\n\n• Small early-stage team (2–3 engineers) building a medium-frequency trading platform for the Indian market (mainly F&O)\n\n• A close friend is involved and referred me to manage the technical side, they see me as a strong CTO candidate if things go well\n\n• Solid funding in place; runway isn’t a concern right now\n\n• Stack is MERN, which I’ve never worked with! I’d need to learn it from the ground up\n\n• They’re willing to fully support my ramp-up\n\n• 2–3 year commitment expected\n\n• Compensation is roughly equal to what I was earning before\n\nOption 2: Data Engineering role with a previous client\n\n• Work involves building a data platform on GCP\n\n• Very much in my comfort zone; I’ve done this kind of work for years\n\n• Slight pay bump\n\n• Feels safe, but also a bit stagnant—low learning, low risk\n\nWhat’s tearing me up:\n\n• The CTO role would push me outside my comfort zone and force me to become a more well-rounded engineer and leader\n\n• My Solutions Engineering background makes me confident I can bridge tech and business, which the CTO role demands\n\n• But stepping away from 7 years of focused data engineering experience—am I killing my momentum?\n\n• What if the startup fails? Will a 2–3 year detour make it harder to re-enter the data space?\n\n• The safe choice is obvious—but the risk could also pay off big, in terms of growth and leadership experience\n\nPersonal context:\n\n• I don’t have major financial obligations right now—so if I ever wanted to take a risk, now’s probably the time\n\n• My friend vouched for me hard and believes I can do this. If I accept, I’d want to commit fully for at least a couple of years\n\nQuestions for you all:\n\n• Has anyone made a similar pivot from a focused engineering specialty (like data) to a full-stack or leadership role?\n\n• If so, how did it impact your career long-term? Any regrets?\n\n• Did you find it hard to return to your original path, or was the leadership experience a net positive?\n\n• Or am I overthinking this entirely?\n\n\nThanks for reading this long post—honestly just needed to write it out. Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who's been through something like this.\n",

Does anyone have recommendations for:\n\n1. Essential libraries for database connectivity, data transformations, and testing?\n2. Industry-standard project layouts for a multi-package Python ETL project?\n\nI’ve seen mentions of tools like Dagster, SQLMesh, dbt, and Airflow, but our scheduling and pipeline requirements are fairly basic.

I don’t have any prior background on data engineering but on our 3 man team I’m the one with the most experience in Python. \n\nWe had been using Prefect which was going well before they moved to a paid model to use our own compute. Previously I had about 25 scripts that would launch at different times to my worker on our company server using prefect. It sadly has to be on my local instance of our server since they rely on something called Alteryx which our two data analysts use basically exclusively. \n\nI liked prefects UI but not the 100$ a month price tag. I don’t really have the bandwidth or good-will credits with our IT to advocate for the self-hosted version. I’ve been thinking of ways to mimic what we had before but I’m at a loss. I don’t know how to have something ‘talk’ to my local like prefect was when the worker was live. \n\nI could set up windows task scheduler but tbh when I first started I inherited a bunch of them and hated the transfer process/setup. My boss would also like to be able to see the ‘failures’ if any happen. \n\nWe have things like bitbucket/s3/snowflake that we use to host code/data/files but basically always pull them down to our local/ inside Alteryx.  \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated and I’m sorry for any incorrect terminology/lack of understanding.

Integrations are SSIS packages and scripts that are kind of in version control, data testing is manual, data analysts have no ability to define or alter tables even though they know the SQL. \n\nThe business is expanding! It's a good place to be. As we expand, it's challenging our existing model. Our speed of execution is showing the bottlenecks around the DBA team, with one Hero Dev doing the majority of the work. They're wrapped up in application changes, warehouse changes, and analytics changes, and feel like they have to touch every part of the process or else everything will break (because again, tests are manual and we're only kind of doing version control).\n\nI'm working with the team on how we can address this. My plan is something like:\n\n* Break responsibility apart into the different teams\n   * Application team is responsible for the application DB\n   * DBA team is responsible for the system of record data warehouse and integrations and consults on design decisions\n   * Analytics team is responsible for reports, \\*including any underlying SQL and reporting warehouse structure\\*\n* Advocate for my Hero Dev to take a promotion towards a data architect and design consulting role bridging the teams, with other DBA's taking on more of the development.\n* Work on adding automated testing to our existing SSIS packages, then work towards having them built into a CI/CD process\n* Work with the analyst team on having their own server + database where they can use a framework or even Fabric to manage their tables and semantic layer themselves.\n\nI acknowledge this is a super high-level plan with a lot of hand-waving. However, I'd love to hear if any of you have run this route before. If you have, how did it go? What bit you, what do you wish you had known, what would you do next time?\n\nThanks",

The capital one offer is almost double the salary, but, in the USA in a MCOL city.\n\nThe DBX offer does have RSUs that would vest over time though.",

        "author": "PencilBoy99",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Issue: you want to increase the value of the data stored, where the data comes from disparate sources, by integrating it (how does X compare to Y) but the systems have inconsistent Master Data / Dimension Data\n\nCan anyone point to a text, Udemy course, etc. that goes into detail surrounding these issues? Particularly when you don't have a mandate to implement a top-down master data management approach?\n\nOff the top of my head the solutions I've read are:\n\n1. Implement a top-down master data management approach. This authorizes you to compel the owners of the source data stores to conform their master data to some standard (e.g., everyone must conform to System X regarding the list of Departments)\n\n2. Implement some kind of mdm tool, which imports data from multiple systems, creates a \"master\" record based on the different sources, and serves as either a cross reference or updates the source system. Often used for things like customers. I would assume now MDM tools include some sort of LLM/Machine Learning to make better deicisions.\n\n3. within the data warehouse store build cross references as you detect anomalies (e.g, system X adds department \"Shops\" - there is no department \"Shops\", so you temporarily give this a unknown dimension entry, then later when you figure out that \"Shops\" is department 12345 add a cross reference and on the next pass its reassigned to 12345.\n\n4. force child systems to at least incorporate the \"owning\" systems unique identifier as a field (e.g, if you have departments then one of your fields must be the department id from System X which owns departments). then in the warehouse each of these rows ties to a different dimension, but since one of the columns is always the System X department ID, users can filter on that.\n\nAre there other design patterns I'm missing?",

Within a couple of years, it may pass this point.\n\n\\- Non-profit pricing or a free basic version is best!\n\n\\- The ability to display 'live' (from true live up to weekly refreshes) major data points on a public website is a huge plus.\n\n\\- I had an absolute nightmare of a time getting a Tableau Trial set up and the customer service was unable to fix a bug on the back end that prevented my email from setting up a demo, so they're out.",

Is there still a realistic chance for someone like me (zero experience, but good German skills and strong tech learning) to break into the German job market—especially in Data Engineering, Cloud Engineering, or even DevOps (I know DevOps is usually a mid-senior role, but still curious)?\n\n\n2. Do you think the job market for Data Engineers in Germany will improve in the next 1–2 years? Or is it becoming oversaturated?\n\n\nI’d really appreciate any honest thoughts or advice. Thanks again for reading.\n",

In this case, the silver layer is being skipped entirely, and the gold layer will serve as a 1:1 technical copy of the source views.\n\nWhile working on the development, I noticed that some of these source views contain duplicate records. I recommended introducing logical business keys to ensure uniqueness and preserve data quality, even though we’re not implementing dimensional modeling. However, the team responsible for the source system insists that the views should be replicated as-is and that it’s unnecessary to define any keys at all.\n\nI’m not convinced this is a good approach, especially for a layer that will be used for downstream reporting and analytics.\n\nWhat would you do in this case?\nWould you still enforce some form of business key validation in the gold layer, even when doing a simple pass-through replication?\n\nThanks in advance.",

So those subsets can run parallel (as without dependency connection they can be started immediately by the platform).\n\nI work in Databricks, which does not allow limiting the number of in-progress tasks at once. If there are too many in-progress tasks, the driver node may receive too large workload and crash.\n\n1. Upscale driver: I do not need this, I could wait for normal, slower, cheaper run.\n\n2. Add a normal dependency from the end of A subtree to the beginning of B subtree. This way I can limit the number of in-progress tasks, but if something in A fails, B will not start. Also it messes up lineage reporting.\n\n3. Same as #2 but the dependency type is All Done. The problem is that if something in A fails, B is started and if it finishes successfully, the pipeline hides the error from A.\n\n4. Create \"dummy tasks\" as checkpoints, connect 10 tasks to the first, checkpoint, connect another 10 ... This would kill the overall performance.\n\n5. Create separated workflows to all dependent subset of tasks, and use All Done connection type between them, and set up error reporting to the sub-workflows.\n\n6.

        "content": "I'm working on some data pipelines for a new source of data for our data lake, and right now we really only have one path to get the data up to the cloud. Going to do some hand-waving here only because I can't control this part of the process (for now), but a process is extracting data from our mainframe system as text (csv), and then compressing the data, and then copying it out to a cloud storage account in S3.\n\nWhy compress it? Well, it does compress well; we see around \\~30% space saved and the data size is not small; we're going from roughly 15GB per extract to down to 4.5GB. These are averages; some days are smaller, some are larger, but it's in this ballpark. Part of the reason for the compression is to save us some bandwidth and time in the file copy.\n\nSo now, I have a spark job to ingest the data into our raw layer, and it's taking longer than I \\*feel\\* it should take. I know that there's some overhead to reading compressed .gzip (I feel like I read somewhere once that it has to read the entire file on a single thread first). So the reads and then ultimately the writes to our tables are taking a while, longer than we'd like, for the data to be available for our consumers.\n\nThe debate we're having now is where do we want to \"eat\" the time:\n\n* Upload uncompressed files (vs compressed) so longer times in the file transfer\n* Add a step to decompress the files before we read them\n* Or just continue to have slower ingestion in our pipelines\n\nMy argument is that we can't beat physics; we are going to have to accept some length of time with any of these options. I just feel as an organization, we're over-indexing on a solution. So I'm curious which ones of these you'd prefer? And for the title: ",

Any access to Postgres data needs to happen through an intermediate mechanism that doesn’t expose raw tables.\n\nWe’re trying to figure out the best way to enrich MySQL-based records with data from Postgres — especially for dashboards and read-heavy workloads — without duplicating or syncing large amounts of data unnecessarily.\n\nWe use AWS in many parts of our stack, but not exclusively. Cost-effectiveness matters, so open-source solutions are a plus if they can meet our needs.\n\nCurious how others have solved this in production — particularly where data lives across systems, but clean, efficient enrichment is still needed without direct table access.",

The data will be pushed into an Azure SQL Database. This Function will be triggered twice a day with a timer  \n\\- store the 1-2 static files (Excel export and some other CSV) on an Azure Blob Storage\n\nNever worked with Azure, so I'm wondering what's the best approach how to structure this. I've been dabbling with \\`az\\` and custom commands, until this morning I stumbled upon \\`azd\\` - which looks more to what I need. But there are no templates available for non-http Functions, so I should set it up myself. \n\n( And some context, I've been a webdeveloper for many years now, but slowly moving into data engineering ... it's more fun :D )\n\nAny tips are helpful.

CDC from on-prem Postgres using AWS DMS\n2. Staging layer in Aurora PostgreSQL - this will combine all the databases for all services and tentants into one big database -  we will also mantain the production schema at this layer - here i am also not sure whether to go straight to Redshit or maybe use S3 for staging since Redshift is not suited for frequent inserts coming from CDC\n3. Final analytics layer in either:\n   * Aurora PostgreSQL - here I am consfused, i can either use this or redshift\n   * Amazon Redshift - I dont know if redshift is an over kill or the best tool\n   * Amazon quicksight for visualisations\n\nWe want to support both real-time updates (low-latency operational dashboards) and cost-efficient historical queries.\n\n# Requirements\n\n* Near real-time change capture (5 - 10 minutes)\n* Cost-conscious (we're open to trade-offs)\n* Works with dashboarding tools (QuickSight or similar)\n* Capable of scaling with new tenants/services over time\n\n# ❓ What I'm Looking For\n\n1. Anyone using a similar **hybrid on-prem → AWS** setup:\n   * What worked or didn’t work?\n2. Thoughts on using Aurora PostgreSQL as a landing zone vs  S3?\n3. Is Redshift overkill, or does it really pay off over time for this scale?\n4. Any gotchas with AWS DMS CDC pipelines at this scale?\n5.

I began with BASIC and assembler on a C64, then I started working professionally with C/C++ then Visual Basic, Lotus Notes, .NET, C#, Java/Spring and now it's mostly JS, Node and React.\n\nI've never been attached to any particular language/technique but looked at what different platforms can offer. It took me quite some time to decide to move to fullstack web since I felt for a long time that web dev was like pounding a square peg through a round hole (and it still feels like that in some aspects), but the JS eco-system is fantastic these days. And JS truly runs everywhere.\n\nSomething that's always amazed me is how some people like to spend their energy on bashing the new stuff that comes along. And it's always about focusing and exaggerating the negative sides. It has reached a point where I'm compelled to give new tech extra attention if it's heavily criticized by other programmers.\nBack in the day those who programmed Visual Basic where \"script kiddies\" and when React and Node came out it received tons of negative opinion only to dominate a few years later.\n \nSo on this note I've lately focused on using AI as much as possible when programming. And I think it's bloody fantastic if used right. And by right I mean to let it do small well defined tasks and integrate into your app. Not prompt it to build an entire app so that you don't understand and can maintain the code.\n\nEspecially CSS/Tailwind which I hate passionately. Just give the layout you want to the AI and let it grind until it looks right.\n\nI get that it can be tempting for new programmers to copy paste AI generated code they don't understand into a project, which is not a good idea. But the \"don't use AI if you're new is just silly in my opinion. A great aspect with AI is that you can have it explain programming concepts \"like I'm five\". It's a  private tutor that never gets tired of your silly questions.\n\nJust my 5c",

        "content": "Hey everyone. Before saying anything I would like to preface that this is my first time posting in a subreddit, so if I did something wrong somehow I apologize in advance (I chose the resource tag because my main question concerns choosing resources to learn).\n\nI have currently completed my second year in uni and am in the midst of my 3-month summer break. I want to spend these three months focusing on learning full stack development (which for now is my career goal ig), and specifically web development. I have this obsession with doing online courses and improving my skills to get better, and I'm also really looking to do some solid projects and start building my resume/cv. \n\nI scoured the internet and found multiple recommended courses which I've listed below. Unfortunately I have a bad habit of just hoarding work and trying to do everything without a plan and regardless of whether it is redundant or not. Here are the courses I gathered:\n\n- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)\n- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)\n- [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j:toc)\n- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn) courses (HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript)\n- [CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/) -> [CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)\n- [Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript and FrontEnd course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/)\n- [freecodecamp Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/)\n- The roadmap on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)\n- [This roadmap](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/vcu5lm/comment/icgeukp/?context=3) by NiagaraThistle\n\nI want to know which of these courses would be enough for me to become skilled at web dev and also set me on the path to becoming a full stack dev. I'd like to know if just one of these courses is actually enough, or if a few are enough then in what sequence should I do them. Of course if I had infinite time I would probably do them all but as of now this is overwhelming and would really appreciate if this could be narrowed down to the absolute essentials, stuff I can feasibly do in < 3 months and still get something out of. I'm aware that TOP seems well praised universally so I'm definitely going to do that.\n\nTo preface I'm fairly adequate in programming and have worked on a few projects, including web-based ones, but I'm really looking to rebuild my skills from scratch if that makes sense.\nI also understand that the best way to learn is through building projects, I get that but I'd like to supplement that with learning theoreticals and any courses from the above (or if there's some other amazing one I somehow missed) which also involve project building would be best. I'd also like to know where I can find some project ideas (I'm aware roadmap.sh has a few). I'd like to build at least 3 projects within the time I have.\n\nAgain would really appreciate some help (if I seem rather clueless in this post it's probably because I am, sorry, any guidance is appreciated)\n",

Sure, at my level (<1 year of programming; yes I am self taught, no I did not get a CS degree), I can  create a terminal based RPG game or create a terminal based CRUD. But when programmers go out and build a compiler, there's a whole world of knowledge required on how to do that, none of which is probably even concretely understandable - only abstractly understandable. To take another example: if you want to get into web development, it is not enough to know JS, HTML, and CSS - one must also know how requests/get/server/browsers work. \n\nSo how does one bridge the gap from being a programmer who can only create a terminal CRUD to becoming a programmer that understands how to build something like a compiler? \n\nMaybe my question is vague because it lacks an objective. I'm sure many of you will say \"what do you want to DO? What's your goal? That will determine how you learn this under-the-hood stuff.\" And yet in the same breath, I suspect most programmers out there have this under-the-hood knowledge that I seem to lack. Where is this knowledge? YouTube tutorials on \"how to build [complicated thingy],\" by necessity, gloss over the important details behind the inner workings of lines of code, because otherwise the video would rabbit-hole quite quickly.

You'd finish a course on Udemy or Coursera and *boom*—screenshot, post it to LinkedIn, maybe even YouTube: \"I completed 10 full-stack dev courses in 2 months!!\" It was all about stacking credentials, even if you hadn't actually built anything yet.\n\nNow it feels like nobody cares. People post their portfolios, small apps, launch their own little SaaS tools, or even tweet out UI clones they built over the weekend. Even beginner YouTubers are documenting \"Building X in 30 days\" instead of \"Which coding bootcamp gave me more certificates.\"\n\nI think a certificate doesn't really prove much anymore. Anyone can follow a tutorial. But building your own thing? That shows actual thinking, effort, and debugging pain.\n\nNot saying certificates are completely useless—they can be a nice way to stay on track or organize your learning—but it feels like hiring managers, other devs care *way* more about what you can show, not what you've watched.\n\nJust curious how others see it:\n\n\\- Do you still collect certs from learning platforms?\n\n\\- Has a certificate *ever* helped you get a job, interview, freelance , or anything like that?\n\n\\- Why do you think they were such a big deal a few years ago?\n\n\\- Would you recommend someone new today focus on getting certificates—or just build stuff?",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Came across with them via a sponsored video and ran through a few threads here about what people think about it.\n\nLet this be the newest one on them:\n\nGamifying the learning process is a clever idea getting more and more adopted by especially more arduous skill acquisition like that of programming.\n\nAlthough [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) promotes on it, \"gaming\" is not emphasized. It's about doing the application, giving the correct answer and leveling up which eventually awards you with chests that yield sitewide currencies/items you spend to keep going on. I didn't try them out yet but Codedex looks more of a gamified service.\n\n\"Holding hands\" approach was the point of criticism from what I saw and I can confirm although I can't critique the service on the method - there are times where a total beginner would be baffled.\n\nHowever, that's where their \"Socratic\" AI called Boots comes in - you can ask him questions and he will proceed to jog your memory by asking you new ones. That might be frustrating to some, especially in cases where you need an outright explanation to a part of the code that was not explicitly taught before.\n\nI did not feel outcasted while getting from zero to half way into Functions tutorials and this is a very good aspect. I respect vendors who do not entice by \"look at this amazing feature you are missing out since you are on free\" and rather convince you by proving their merits and generating the feeling that they are worth your financial support if you are able.\n\nI am from Turkey and I saw purchasing power parity discount on top of the promotion one so that's another plus for people like us who are crushed under their evil governments' poor management.\n\nI am in no way affiliated with [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev) \\- I just felt I needed to pay my respects for offering a more-free-than-premium service who also care about where you are from. Programming-wise, I think there would be better people who are seasoned enough to comment on their curriculum and pace of progress.\n\nCheers.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Disclaimer: I still consider myself \"new\" to programming. I'm not an expert by any means. I just want to share my story.\n\nEver since I started listening to discussions surrounding memory management, I've had a growing interest in C/C++. Several months ago, I began studying open source C++ repositories and trying to put together all the pieces of a mostly complete program. \n\nIt was a disaster, honestly. I quickly came to realize that my first impression of programming was overly simplistic and due for a refactor. I depended on the verbose nature of Java more than I thought I did. I took for granted all the things the Java Virtual Machine handled automatically until I was introduced to header files and Cmake. I'd argue this is one of the most important recognitions I've made about programming in general so far. It made me focus more on compiler behavior, pre-compile tasks, and all the madness going on in the terminal rather than just how good I can code, follow exception messages or solve surface level problems.\n\nMy advice for new learners of C or C++: \n\n1. Be very patient with it. Take extended breaks (burnout can occur quickly)\n\n2. The coding part will mostly be simple following a tutorial. It's everything else regarding the compiler tasks, headers, proper linking, and so on that will be troubling because it's not common for Java programmers to deal with that.\n\n3. Reading code others wrote in C++ will be madness, but it is necessary for learning. Stay resilient. You'll eventually start following the logic more easily.\n\n4. There are several C/C++ compilers out there. make sure you're choosing the one the project you're looking at expects. It's been an unexpected sticking point for me. People say the compiler won't make any meaningful difference in performance, which can be mistaken as saying the compiler choice doesn't matter at all. It will matter, just not for performance.\n\n5. Cmake is a friend, not a foe. Follow its instructions and download the CMake UI so you can see all the missing data at once. It'll mostly be seen in large projects.\n\n6. Building a project is less about the code itself and more about file linking. Pointing the compiler to all associated files is top priority to learn (in my opinion)\n\n7. C/C++ makes no assumptions about your platform. That's more significant than I first imagined. It's another thing the JVM handles under the hood\n\nIf I am misguided about any of this, please let me know. Drop some stories in the comments about your learning experience as well and I'll happily read them",

It might also be a good way to build a more visible portfolio of recent work.\n\nHowever, I'm also wondering if the \"every single day\" commitment is realistic.

Some are C language developed projects, some are c++ (open source games mostly).\n\nSo here's where I'm stuck: From what I gather, c++ is more difficult overall for a beginner to learn than c, but the open source projects I would be interested in that are in c are likely more difficult to get a handle on as a beginner. So I'm not sure if I go with the higher difficulty lang or higher skill-floor projects? Secondly, I'm on an absolute poopoo of a laptop :D it's this old thinkpad I'm going to strip and put linux on. It has an SSD but is an old i3 (dual-core 2.1GHz Intel Core i3-2310M CPU) from like 12 years ago or whatever (thinkpad x220i aww yeah) so there will be some hardware limitations. (another checkmark for C maybe?)\n\nThankfully, it's 2025 and there is a TON of resources online for getting started with both languages, and discord servers to support it are just amazing.

However I want to try and get as deep as I can with learning CS and contributing as quickly as I can so I want to focus on just one technology or stack. \n\nSuggestions or input? \n\nThanks!",

I’m familiar with the basics of:\n\nJava\n\nC\n\nC++\n\nPython\n\n\nHere’s what I’m aiming for:\n\nStrong grasp of DSA for interviews and placements\n\nTargeting product-based companies like Amazon, Google, etc.\n\nAlso want to stay aligned with AIML work (so Python might be useful?)\n\n\nI’ve heard that C++ is great for CP and interview prep, Java is used in a lot of company interviews, and Python is super readable but might be slower or not ideal for certain problems.\n\nSo my question is:\nWhich language should I stick to for DSA as an AIML student who wants to crack top tech company interviews and still work on ML projects?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences, pros & cons, and what worked for you!\n\nThanks a lot in advance 🙏\n",

I'm here to ask for some tips and advices for both personal and carrier growth. \n\nSome years ago, after university, I had to start from beginning to change my work carrier and for the first time, I've approached to the coding world. I love it.  I took a master in data science, then I continued to study, c# and unity for game developer. I was hired as data scientist but few months later, the project ended and I was moved in another segment in the same society, as solution architect, with something that really wasn't suit for me. So, I spent some months for a master in devops and I finally could ask to change another team, this time in a team of integration. My team works as middle ware,  and I could learn a lot about microservices, api, Aws tools and such that we have as infrastructure. \n\nSo, I decided to stop trying to learn from others and start study, again, in order to have a robust knowledge of the entire process, end to end. So, with the chance to see how some lambda function (Aws) was integrated into other tools, I asked to write a new one that was needed for a new application. Following all pipeline and integrate it into cloud watch. Was a good work (both cause I used cdk libraries, but mostly cause I saw how pipelines really work in production, as a player and not just spectator). \n\nBut in the end, the more I learn, the more I find out new stuff, that probably should have been discovered ten years ago at the university. So, right now, I'm trying to study about spring boot and Java, nodejs, maven, camel and how to make whole works together, in order to write good api/web app. \n\nNow, I feel full of stuff I don't know, and in my future I would like to have the chance to work as software dev, solution architect or whatever, cause I feel like all these worlds overlap somehow, somewhere.\n\nThat said, I kindly ask for some suggestions:\n\n1)where should I start?\n2)what should I prioritize? \n3)im not gonna lie, I'm using a lot chatgpt or Claude to study, like asking focused questions, like usage, best practice, asking for exercises and dig down every time I have a doubt, but, because I always been a self taught in this world, I have no idea if there are books, documentations or whatever that can be exhaustive and valid.\n\nI know can be confusing, but I'm very confused right now. The moment in your life when you realize you know enough to be where you are, but not enough to go much further. \n\nThanks for your time ",

        "content": "First of all I'll give some context:\n\nWebsite is made using a template in HTML, CSS and JS. Its hosted on Vercel with a custom domain. Its not a static website and uses a server behind the scenes for stuff like \"serving\" the html files from a public folder and contact.html so that people that visit the website can send us messages (That's also why its not hosted on Github). It uses NodeJS, ExpressJS and other Javascript libraries for having the server capabilities. Now I have not really studied and worked on ExpressJS and all but I was able to vibe-code it (I know I'm sorry but its my dad that wanted the website really quick).\n\nFast forward to present day and my dad wants a blog page in the website. Now I asked copilot in VSCode to do do it for me but turns out it got really complicated. I setup a database schema in supabase connected to vercel and then it started spewing out all these lines of code that didn't work at all and I got confused. (`POST /api/blog`, `GET /api/blog` etc)\n\nSo what my dad wants is that he should be able to make posts preferably with images and thats it. When I first heard of it, I thought maybe he would also like people to be able to comment and like on posts as well. Well he has clarified that he just wants the first part only. Now the thing is how should I go about it. I have 2 choices:\n1. Use something like what copilot gave me (Use GET methods along with response and requests) (Gonna have to learn it from YT tutorials and docs since \"AI slop\")\n2. Create a simple posts.json file and loading the posts from that website using JS script. (Only issue would be how to add images in a json file; maybe base64 encoding would work; base64 is quite heavy though). And then create a Flutter app that allows my dad to create, edit and delete posts and when he clicks on submit, it would automatically get pushed onto my vercel repository in production.\n\nFirst approach seems better to make it look like a proper production application whereas the second approach is a just a make-shift thing\n\nWhich one do you think I should work on? And if there's something you'd like to add, please tell me.\n\nPS: I'm more of a machine learning kind of guy and not frontend and all",

        "content": "Modern programming languages, especially dynamic languages have a really good thing going for them which is there is a library for pretty much everything you want to do which is wrapper that makes it easy for you to do the thing without ever having to understand the core architecture of how something is happening.\n\nFor example, talking about JS env: Need servers? Express. Need sockets? Socket.io. And so on.\n\nThis makes it really easy tod develop application quickly and unfortunately that's all that an organisation would care for too.\n\nIn my resume if someone sees a chat application, they don't care if I implemented the web socket architecture or I just used a library. They may ask that stuff in an interview and still not mind that I used a library.\n\nNow, I have found out that, that I'm really dumb. I had been using web servers for an year in JS and only recently I figured out the entire architecture when I had to build an HTTP server from scratch in C. It has been a huge challenge and still is.\n\nI also learnt how to implement an event loop. But would any company care about these skills if I don't have any decent project? I don't think so.\n\nBut, keeping my own subjective thinking and personal experiences aside, I had a doubt.\n\nIf I learn how to apply a concept without first trying to understand it completely, is this a good strategy?\n\nLike because I learnt Express, I had an easy time creating macros for implementing routes in my C HTTP server. I just imitated a syntax similar to that in C.\n\nOn the other hand, had I never used Express, I don't think my abstraction of routes would be like the way Express has and don't know if it would have been this good which it is now.\n\nSo, clearly the learning of the application helps the learning of architecture just as much as learning the architecture helps learning the application.\n\nWith this, what do you suggest:\n\n- Learn application first, no matter how you do it.\n- Learn architecture first and then design your own and learn application through that instead of a simply using libs.\n- A mid ground, learn architecture, learn application using whatever tool is necessary and then if one wishes, one can design their architecture from scratch as well.",

I began reading more and more about design patterns and techniques like generics and other advanced concepts. When the opportunity came along, I made the switch to Go. However, I never quite got used to the syntax—it felt a bit old-school, with very short and cryptic naming conventions. After more than a year, when I was offered a job working with C# I decided to switch again.\n\nUnfortunately, that company turned out to be a poor fit. They refused to adopt modern patterns, and the codebase was in a terrible state. And after six months, I moved on to another C# role, hoping for a better experience. But again, the codebase was a mess, and the work was split roughly 75% frontend and 25% backend.\n\nSince I had to work on the frontend, I started learning TypeScript. I really enjoyed many of the concepts and examples I came across while learning it, but sadly, the actual codebase I worked with didn’t reflect any of that what I learned and there was no room or time to improve that was already there.\n\nFor the full picture: in addition to my 40-hour work week, I would often spend another 40 hours learning and building proof of concepts. You could say programming was my life.\n\nI started doubting if it wasn’t time to do something else and when another type of job came along I stepped off the programming wagon. \n\nI expected I would get my enjoyment in programming back in the hours that I used to make besides my work, but instead I just stopped programming all together.\n\nNow more then 2 years further I’m willing to pick it up in my sparetime again.\n\nBut i don’t want to do course after course. I’m also not really sure what language I want to pick up. Not what to build.\n\nThe main advantage of typescript is that I can write frontend and backend code with it. I could pick up c# or even try f# (always loved the functional syntax). I could go back to php? Or maybe try out rust or elixer? Just thinking about it makes me want to quit again? So maybe I’m not ready to pick it up again.\n\nI wonder if anyone has some advice to break out of this? Although I do enjoy my current job. I do want to get back into software development eventually.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m a 27-year-old career switcher. I have a Econ degree (2020), and spent the last 5 years in finance-related roles. I've been teaching myself to code for the last 7 months (great timing, I know). \n\nAt first I was just doing it for fun, but then it became one of the more meaningful parts of my life. I used to think I liked finance, but really I just liked saying \"stonks go up\". By contrast coding is predictable, controllable, you eventually can figure out where you f\\*cked up, and how you can improve. It's a kind learning environment.  And in that there is peace. \n\nBut I feel like I was just about 2-3 years too late on that realization. \n\nA couple months ago, I was very confident I could make it as a professional developer. Now I don't know. There's a lot of fear-mongering and apocalyptic prophesying going on. Some say AI is going to wipe out junior dev jobs. Some say there will still be plenty of demand but you’ll need to be more senior-level faster. And junior postings are way down. Layoffs everywhere.\n\nHow the heck are we supposed to know what to focus on, when everything's up in the air?\n\nI've done alot of research and experimenting with all these roles, some thoughts: \n\n* **Front-end** / **Web Design** \\- S.O.L\n* **Full-stack** \\- somewhat better, but very generalist skillset\n* **Back-end -** pretty good open vis-a-vis AI defenseability, good way to niche-up\n* **Cloud** / **DevOps** \\- clearest path to employment, good balance of supply/demand\n* **MLE / MLOps** \\- highest demand, but very low base pool, and I don’t have a stats/ML background\n* **Blockchain** \\- thought about it given my finance background but very sketch \n* **Data Science / ML** \\- did a bootcamp, not fan of stats \n\nExploring all of these definitely set me back on the web stack, but I did finish The Odin Project, the first half of Full Stack Open (Core Course, 5 credits), and partially through a milion other courses on Scrimba, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, [Boot.dev](http://Boot.dev), Coursera, etc. \n\nI'm also considering a master’s to hedge my bets, hoping that by the time I come out the other end in 2-3 years, the markets will have settled. No idea if worth it, but on the other hand grinding projects feels pointless with the current freeze on junior hires. \n\nSo my question is this. \n\nWhat path should I focus on as a self-taught dev with no degree, in this brutal market for junior devs? Should I target back-end, cloud, or something like MLOps? Is a master’s a smart move, or should I double down on projects and networking? \n\nAny advice would be mucho appreciated, thanks!",

Usage of (appropriate) design patterns\n2. Scalability, and performance considerations\n3. Big O complexity considerations and usage of relevant, appropriate data structures\n4. Inclusion of additional functionality, so if I had a to do app, including it to be available on mobile/cloud (such as using streamlit from python) would elevate it\n5. Real world/life functionality, such as expansion of use cases to encompass practical, business domains and situations.\n6. A project that is specific/applicable to a specific domain, such as an anti-money laundering detection project within banking, or fraud detection within a commercial website/ banking\n7. Good code practices: clean, concise, modular code, with adherence to principles such as Single Responsibility Principle for functions, usage of seperation of concerns, abstracting data from logic\n8. actually including a well-written README file that details the functionality and use cases associated with the project within the git/github repository, with appropriate commenting of novel/atypical processes within the program.\n9. Adherence and implemention of SOLID principles, and generally high rates of cohesion and low rates of coupling.",

However, I'm struggling with two main challenges that are holding me back.\n\nFirst, I'm having trouble with the fundamentals of problem-solving and breaking down complex tasks. Despite watching tutorials, reading forums, and attempting LeetCode problems, everything feels overwhelming. I suspect I need to start even more basic than most beginners - perhaps at what I'd call a \"level -1.\" To address this, I'm planning to work with a tutor who can help me build a solid foundation before I try to learn independently.\n\nSecond, I'm unsure about which programming specialization to pursue. This uncertainty stems partly from my lack of confidence, but I now understand that working on personal projects is crucial for growth. Previously, I relied solely on LeetCode and books like \"How to Think Like a Programmer\" by Anton Spraul, but this community has shown me these should only supplement hands-on practice, not replace it.\n\nMy main question is: Can I develop core programming skills that would transfer to any specialization I eventually choose - whether that's web development, DevOps, cloud engineering, or something else? Would it be better to pick a beginner-friendly area like web development to start with, or are there specific foundational projects and practices that would serve me well regardless of my eventual path?\n\nI'm open to any guidance you can offer, and I plan to utilize resources like tutoring, online communities, and Discord servers to support my learning journey.",

I just let the lectures play in the background while I do other things, then I take the test and that's it.\n\nJS/HTML/CSS Course: I started with a programming logic course and then jumped straight into this one.\n\nThe Project: I'm building it with the help of Gemini Pro, and I think it's a relatively simple project. It's being developed with several technologies like Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and others.\n\nWhat I'd like to get your opinion on is this: I've paused my JS/HTML/CSS course to focus on the project, because everyone keeps saying the best way to learn is to get your hands dirty. Since I have no experience, I ask the AI to give me a step-by-step guide of what we're going to do, followed by the code with a line-by-line explanation of its functionality. I finish by writing the lines myself and questioning some parts (which has led to more work, as I end up making it more robust than the AI's initial version and then have to make changes throughout the project).\n\nDo you think I should carry on like this, or should I go back to the course and build smaller projects related to the lessons? And also, should I be doing LeetCode/Codewars, etc.?\n\nI really appreciate anyone who read all of this, and even more so anyone who's willing to reply. :)",

I’ll test how the agent handles it and use the results to improve its reasoning + code quality.\n\nThank you 🙏! All types of problems welcome - beginner to advanced.\n\n",

Now I have just been asked to contribute new features to an existing Fortran project, a language with which I am not at all familiar. Based on some initial reading, the basics and mechanics of the language seem easy enough to learn, so I'm not too worried there.\n\nGiven the constraints of the mostly F77 fixed format and the ... lax ... coding habits of the primary developer (who is still on the project—big plus), the millions of lines legacy codebase is very convoluted with minimal comments and has super short & cryptic variable/function/subroutine names. The primary developer was kind enough to give me a very high level overview of the code and point me to the files (each having over 20k LOC) that were pertinent to my feature, but not much beyond that.\n\nWhat is the best way to get started developing in an environment like this? The first thing that I came up with is a spreadsheet to log the different variables/functions/subroutines, a brief description of each as far as I can figure out, their first sighting, and their type. Any other ideas on how I can start successfully eating this elephant?",

Here is how I would break it down.\n\n1. **Understand the problem first (3 mins)** \\- restate it back, walk through examples, ask about constraints.\n2. **Don't code immediately (5 mins)** \\- discuss approaches starting with brute force, explain why it's bad, then work up to optimal solution. DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION. You don't have time for that.\n3. **Get buy-in (10 mins)** \\- make sure interviewer agrees with your approach before coding. I write pseudocode comments first as an outline, then flesh it out. A common failure pattern is coding something that the interviewer doesn't understand.\n4. **Wrap up (2 mins)** \\- explain time/space complexity, offer to write tests for edge cases, or move on to the next problem.\n\n**How I prepared:**\n\n* Use Blind 75. It has good coverage over all problems.\n* I DID NOT buy leetcode premium. If you study and understand the patterns, it doesn't matter what problem you get.\n\nI know the market is ass right now and the competition is rough, but stay disciplined and the hard work will pay off!

It impacts your life, your industry, how you’re paid, what the Chief Financial Officer sees and uses to justify paying you six figures, and your tax rebates if you’re planning to start or work in a startup.\n\nI’m going to lay out the facts in a (hopefully) objective way. \n\nThe credit I’m talking about:\n\nThe Research and Development Tax Credit under IRC Tax Code 174. \n\nEDIT: Edits will be for formatting. \n\nThe law that changed it:\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (specifically under section 13206). \n\n\n\nThis provision was initially drafted by Kevin Brady (R-TX), and advocated significantly for by Republican lawmakers. \n\n\n\nThe House of Representatives vote:\n\n227 Republicans For\n\n13 Republicans Against\n\n\n\n0 Democrats For\n\n192 Democrats Against\n\n\n\nThe Senate vote:\n\n51 Republicans For\n\n0 Republicans Against\n\n\n\n0 Democrats For\n\n47 Democrats, and 2 Independents Against \n\n\n\nThe final result:\n\nSigned into law by President Donald Trump on December 22, 2017. \n\n\n\nDate it took effect:\n\nJanuary 1, 2022\n\n\n\nWhy so late?\n\nA fun, gimmicky workaround to the Byrd Rule and to delay costly tax hikes until after the 5-year mark, while cashing in on any revenue after the 10-year mark. \n\n\n\nIn short, it was a play to look fiscally responsible, but didn’t provide any tax cuts. It just kicked the can down the road and offset immediate tech conglomerate backlash. \n\n\n\nThey assumed that this provision would be removed or indefinitely delayed by future Congress, but they didn’t. \n\n\n\nPrevious:\n\n\n\nPrior to 2022, businesses were able to immediately (same year tax break) cash in and deduct R&D expenses, including software developer and other IT professionals’ salaries, IT infrastructure changes, engineer innovation in all sectors, and more. \n\n\n\nAfter 2022:\nAll of the expenses covered by the R&D credit now has to be capitalized and amortized. \n\n\n\nFor domestic research, they are required to amortize over 5 years. \n\n\n\nFor foreign research, they are required to amortize over 15 years. \n\n\n\nMeaning that, prior to 2022, a $1M investment into software development and cyber security would be fully deductible for fiscal year 22. \n\n\n\nNow, that same $1M investment into those same fields would only allow for $200k to be deductible for the fiscal year, and the remaining $800k would need to be spread out over the remaining four.\n\n\n\nWhich resulted in layoffs, frozen hiring, cash flow strain for startups and tech firms, and immediate tax burden on companies employing R&D-based that persists to today. \n\n\n\nBUT! There is a bipartisan bill that’s going through Congress right now to reverse it and retroactively apply the lost tax credits back to businesses from 2021 forward, but we’ll see where it goes!",

        "content": "Yes, there are a few downsides. The market is also pretty shitty. BUT.. other fields have it so much worse than us.\n\nWhy SWE is the best:\n\n* Even if your goal is to just be an average SWE, you will still end up making 2x or 3x what most other fields make.\n* The ability to work from home or have a flexible hybrid schedule is AMAZING. There are so many jobs where you have to show up to work at a very specific time and if you're even 1 minute late, you get reprimanded for it. How cool is it that we can show up to work at 11am and leave whenever we want? How cool is it to tell you manager \"Hey I'll be away this afternoon\" and they are totally fine with it? Not many fields have this luxury.\n* The work is genuinely interesting. Software runs the world. It's awesome to be able to understand how these big systems work and be able to contribute to them. Through real world work + a Computer Science degree, the 'magic' behind computers vanishes and you really start to acknowledge the beauty behind all the abstractions. It's just such a cool field in general.\n* There is so much variety in what companies you can work for. Want an extremely prestigious and high paying job? You know what to study to make that happen. Want a chill job? You know where to apply for those. Want to join an exciting start-up and work on something from the ground up while wearing multiple hats? Yeah, there are tons of those jobs too. The possibilities are endless.\n* Similar to the above, there is tons of variety in what you can do in your career. Since SWE is so intertwined with every other field, the possibilities are near endless. Want to make web-apps for millions of people? DO IT!! Want to work on medical devices to save people's lives? YES QUEEN. How about writing code for satellites that power GPS systems across the world? LETS GO!!! Oh, you want to write code for simulation software so scientists can research the effects of earthquakes? AYYYY BRUH!! Literally the possibilities are endless.\n* It's an office job. I don't have to be out in the extreme heat or extreme cold breaking my body. People who work in manual labour jobs are completely screwed by the time they hit their mid 30s. Aching backs, wrists, shoulders, neck, you name it. Their body is broken when they get into their prime years. The work is also brutal. Imagine lifting heavy things for 12 hours a day in extreme weather, just to make $50k a year? Meanwhile I'm in the office (or at home in my pajamas) drinking some coffee and working on a cool puzzle.. and getting paid tons of money to do it.\n* The ability to impact millions of people with your code. Not many fields have access to such a large scale as we do. If you work for a well-known company, then it's likely that the features you build and the code that you push will affect the lives of literally millions of people across the world. It's cool to know that your work is recognized on such a global scale.\n\nSo yeah. I know times are tough right now. There are some downsides of course too. But overall, I think SWE is still the best field.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Feel free to add your own points as I'm sure I missed a ton of things.",

        "content": "I'm losing my mind with this job market. 6 months of searching and I'm getting absolutely nowhere.\n\nMy background: 1 year as sysadmin (Linux, Windows Server, monitoring, automation), 2 years teaching cybersecurity at university level, currently freelancing doing ISMS implementations and ISO 27001 consulting. Master's in Cybersecurity. I can script, I know my way around networks, I've deployed everything from ELK stacks to Kubernetes clusters.\n\nBut apparently none of that matters because:\n\n**\"We need someone with 5+ years experience\"** \\- Dude, I have 4+ years in IT, just not all in the same role. Why does teaching cybersecurity to students not count as experience? Why does implementing security frameworks for actual paying clients not count?\n\n**\"You don't have experience with Palo Alto/Fortinet/SonicWall\"** \\- IT'S A FUCKING FIREWALL. Yes, each vendor has their own special snowflake syntax and GUI, but the concepts are the same. Port 443 is port 443 whether it's pfSense or a $50k Palo Alto. Give me a week with the documentation and I'll be configuring rules like I've been doing it for years.\n\n**\"We need someone who knows our exact stack\"** \\- Cool, so you want a unicorn who has experience with your specific combination of ancient VMware, that one obscure monitoring tool you bought in 2015, and whatever cloud mess you've accumulated over the years.\n\nThe worst part? Half these jobs get reposted every month because *surprise* \\- that perfect candidate doesn't exist or doesn't want to work for your lowball salary.\n\n**And another thing** \\- why the fuck don't internships count as \"real experience\"? I spent 3 years doing actual work during internships. Not fetching coffee or making copies - I was troubleshooting servers, implementing security policies, managing infrastructure. But apparently that's \"just internship experience\" and doesn't count toward their magical 5-year requirement.\n\nMeanwhile, every goddamn article and report keeps screaming about the **\"cybersecurity skills shortage\"** and **\"millions of unfilled IT positions.\"** You know what would solve that? HIRING THE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE EAGER TO LEARN AND PROVE THEMSELVES.\n\nInstead, companies want to poach already-established professionals from other companies, creating this stupid musical chairs game where everyone just shuffles around for higher salaries while entry-level candidates get locked out entirely. Then they act shocked when there's a \"talent shortage.\"\n\nI've had interviews where I walk them through actual projects I've completed, demonstrate my problem-solving skills, show them my homelab setup, and then get rejected because I haven't used their specific brand of the same damn technology I've been working with for years.\n\nAnd don't get me started on cybersecurity roles. \"Entry level position, 5 years experience required.\" The math doesn't fucking math. How am I supposed to get experience if no one will hire me to get experience?\n\nI know some of you have been in similar situations. How did you break through this stupid cycle? I'm starting to think I should just lie on my resume about having used every vendor's gear and hope they don't quiz me on CLI commands during the interview.\n\n/rant\n\n**TL;DR:** Job market is stupid, vendors need to stop making the same technology with different commands, and HR departments need to learn the difference between \"nice to have\" and \"absolutely required.\"",

Hear me out. What prompted me thinking about this:\n\nOur Sr Director just announced she was leaving after 1 year with the company, and another Sr Manager adjacent to mine left recently with 1 year at the company. I checked both their LinkedIn profiles - the director has worked at 10 companies in 15 years, and the manager 12 companies in 20 years. \n\nWhat kind of stability is that? These are folks who have a lot of employees reporting to them, and we rely on them for direction and culture building. Also, why are companies continually OK hiring people like this? That's what I *really* don't get. You think you're the special company where this new hire is going to stick around, after over a decade of ~1-1.5 year tenures? It just seems like an incredible waste of resources.\n\nEverywhere I look on LinkedIn, it's the same. 1-2 year tenures at every company. Hell, that's barely enough time to really learn the ropes and build some impact projects. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of these people really don't know what they're doing and their actual job is just \"job hopper.\"\n\nThoughts?",

I wasn't actually expecting anything great because a couple weeks ago I was told that they still wanted to interview other candidates, but surprisingly the recruiter started giving me information about the job including what my exact salary would be, the bonus, etc. All details that were not concrete at this point.\n\nI was a little confused so I asked \"Is this you firmly giving me a job offer\" and the reply was \"Here at MC we don't give job offers, this is a calibration.\"\n\nStill confused, I tried to get more information and said I was interested and said I wanted to discuss with my wife. The recruiter said that is okay, but let me know in a few hours. I asked for the weekend to think it over and said I would get back Monday. This seemed okay but said she would need the answer soon because of other candidates.\n\nTruthfully I have another final round that I am hoping to hear good news back from next week, but wanted to know if anyone had ever heard something similar about them not calling the job offer an actual job offer?",

For my fourth internship, I worked on core changes that were actually used at scale (millions only, not billions like Meta).\n\nMy point is that I think it’s clear that I am willing to put in long hours, I’m able to BS impact, I’ve worked at scale, and I’ve been previously a high-performer elsewhere.

        "author": "LeadBamboozler",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Sharing this as a heads-up for anyone considering interviewing with CoreWeave, especially for security or infrastructure roles. I went through two interview loops with them, several months apart, and was ghosted once and required multiple follow-ups to not be ghosted a second time — despite confirmed positive feedback from interviewers.\n\n**Round 1 (~7 months ago)**\n\nI interviewed for a Tech Lead role with a near perfect match in domain, stack, ownership, and experience level. Went through five rounds:\n\n- Recruiter\n- Director\n- Tech Lead (coding round)\n- Principal Engineer (system design)\n- Security Analyst (cross-functional)\nI moved through the interview cycle and after the cross-functional round, the recruiter emailed me thanking me for taking the time to interview and said he’d collate the feedback and be in touch when he had an update. Ghosted after this email despite repeated follow-ups. I connected with the Director on LinkedIn a month or so after this.\n\n**Round 2 (3 weeks ago)**\n\nThe director shared a Staff Engineer posting that looked to be a direct replacement for the Tech Lead role, so I reached out to him on LinkedIn. He apologized for the earlier ghosting, said I got strong feedback, and that the org had new leadership and shifted direction — fewer managers, more senior ICs. He said he’d love to re-engage and that the recruiter would reach out.\n\nThe recruiter (same one who ghosted me originally) called me a few days later — but instead of the Staff role, he described an Infrastructure Security role that had similar domain requirements. Maybe I should’ve clarified right then, but I assumed it was all part of the same track and the recruiter mentioned that I would be assessed on the same principles that I was assessed on in the previous interview loop - he explicitly said that he had no concerns at all.\n\nThey scheduled me with a new distinguished engineer who had joined since the original ghosting. We did not cover a single topic that was discussed in the previous interview.\n\nWhile the discussion was somewhat related to my area, there was a focus on some fairly obscure but oddly specific topics. Despite the curveball - I think I reasoned correctly about the nuances while acknowledging that this area was not something I had direct experience in. The discussion was still highly collaborative and flowed naturally and at the end, the DE mentioned he hoped to speak with me again soon.\n\nThen: more silence. Followed up with the recruiter. Nothing. Followed up with the Director on LinkedIn. He said, “let me talk to the recruiter.” A few days later I got a templated rejection email. Zero feedback with an explicit note in the template saying they can’t provide feedback.\n\nI understand that goals evolve quickly at high-growth companies. But from a candidate’s perspective, this felt like goalposts were shifting between cycles, and maybe even between rounds. There is a total misalignment in what they’re looking for and across what experience levels. Interestingly - one of the questions I asked DE was *what was the hardest problem he was trying to solve at CoreWeave?*\n\nHis answer? Hiring and building the team.\n\nSo if you're thinking of interviewing with CoreWeave: proceed with your eyes open. This process burned a lot of my time, and I walked away with zero signal on where I was off target.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've helped a lot of students & early-career folks with job hunting, and one fear comes up all the time: **networking**. So many people are scared they'll say the wrong thing, or that their message will just get ignored.\n\nTotally get it! I've been there too. But based on what I’ve seen from job seekers who’ve actually landed roles (including some who started with zero connections), here are some tips that really work:\n\n\n\n**1. Start with a 15 min coffee chat**\n\nDon’t overthink it. You’re not asking for a job. You’re just asking for 15 minutes to get to know the other person’s position. Most professionals remember what it felt like in the beginning, and they’re happy to help.\n\nYou can say something like, “Hi \\[name\\], I’m currently studying \\[major\\] and exploring career paths in \\[field\\]. If you’d like to chat with me for 15 minutes, I’d love to hear about your experiences.”\n\n\n\n**2. Build rapport: \\~2 min**\n\nDon’t jump right into the subject. Start by warming up with a friendly opening line:\n\n“How are you doing today?”\n\n“Hope you’re having a great week, thank you for your time!”\n\nIt’s a small thing, but it can create a relaxed atmosphere and make both parties feel more comfortable.\n\n\n\n**3. Introduce yourself: 2-3 min**\n\nKeep it brief and to the point. Think of it like your LinkedIn verbal summary.\n\n“I’m currently a Data Analytics student at \\[school\\] and I’m really interested in marketing analytics. I’ve worked on projects with A/B testing and Tableau dashboards, and I’d love to learn more about what careers in this field really look like.”\n\nConfidence comes from clarity of thought: if you know what you want, you’ll be ten times more confident when you speak your mind.\n\n\n\n**4. Ask two good questions: \\~10 min**\n\nThis is where you learn. Try:\n\n“What do you like most (and least) about your job?”\n\n“How did you get into this field?”\n\n“If you graduated today, what would you focus on?”\n\nAvoid asking generic questions like “How is your company?” Just try to show curiosity and depth.\n\n\n\n**5. Follow up consistently**\n\nSend a quick thank you note and ask if they’d like to stay in touch. That’s it. Relationships are developed through follow-up, not one-off chats.\n\n\n\n**Tips:**\n\n\\- If you don't hearing back so far: Try alumni, smaller companies, or people who are 1-3 years ahead of you. They’re often more responsive than FAANG executives.\n\n\\- Feeling nervous all the time? Write a pitch and practice it with a friend before the actual chat.\n\n\\- Keep a spreadsheet of who you reached out to, when, and what you learned.\n\nSo if you’re afraid of networking, you’re not alone. I’ve been there. Take the first step and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at where it leads.\n\n\n\nHas anyone else networked their way into your first job? How did you succeed?",

Just wrapped up my interview loops after leaving Amazon, and have two offers on the table:\n\n* **Affirm: Senior Software Engineer @ Identity Decisioning (180k Salary + 130k RSUs/yr)**\n* **Atlassian: Principal Software Engineer @ Rovo (240k Salary + 187k RSU/yr + 20% Bonus)**\n\nI'm currently stumped. As Blind/Glassdoor indicate that Atlassian is an absolute horror show. Affirm seems like a very chill company & I had a good time interviewing with them. The same goes for Atlassian, as each interview I had was generally chill & the hiring manager I met with was very nice. \n\nMy gut tells me to take the risk since the comp difference is too much to pass up/this is a potential level up in my career. My main worry is: I've seen various horror stories on Blind & Glassdoor, that make it sound like I'm signing myself for a death march if I end up going with Atlassian. Can anyone who has worked at Atlassian chime in here? I feel like those employed at Atlassian on Blind are very aggressive in telling people to avoid it at all costs, is joining Atlassian a bad career move???\n\nWhat would you all do in my situation? Take Affirm or Atlassian?\n\n  \nPreviously an L6 at Amazon for 3 years (left due to RTO). So I have some idea of how to navigate a traditional big tech climate.",

I’m a mid-level developer, and unfortunately most of my workforce are seniors so basically I’m in the chopping block and one of the first to leave if layoffs happen.\n\nI’m torn.

        "content": "I joined a startup about a year ago, fresh out of grad school. I was really excited. My role was to explore how we could use large language models and build AI systems to improve our content and automate workflows. I was mostly a backend engineer, creating APIs, and I loved it.\n\n\nA little while ago, our CEO suddenly decided our company needs to be \"AI first\". On the surface, that sounds great for someone in my role. But the execution is becoming a nightmare. Any complex technical challenge I bring up gets dismissed with a wave of his hand and a simple, \"Oh yeah just write a prompt and develop it fast\".\nWe are now in a phase where we are actively breaking things that already work perfectly fine, just to rebuild them the \"AI way\". The logic seems to be that if it doesn't use a large language model, it's obsolete, which makes no sense.\n\nThe worst part, however, is what this has done to my job. The CEO now expects every engineer to own the entire product process from start to finish. This means we are all now responsible for writing long product requirement documents, creating wireframes, coding the frontend, developing the backend APIs, and then deploying and integrating everything ourselves.\n\nI chose a career in engineering specifically because I did not enjoy product management. Now, it's a core part of my job. And when concerns are raised about the massive new workload and lack of experience in these areas, the response is just, \"Oh yeah just use ChatGPT to write the document\".\n\nMy work feels less meaningful every day. I went from being a specialized engineer working on interesting AI problems to a generalist doing a bit of everything, without any real depth or focus. My passion for coding and building robust systems is fading. It feels like my actual engineering skills are being devalued in favor of someone who can just prompt an AI for a passable solution to everything.\n\nIs this what the future of tech work looks like? Are other companies operating this way?\n",

Even though my thesis is basically finished, she hasn't even gotten around to fully reading my current final draft yet.\n\nAs per my university policy, it doesn't seem like I can get my degree conferred until *next semester.*\n\nI finished all my classes and every other M.S. degree requirement.\n\nWhat should I do? Will this conflict with any background checks, etc.? I haven't really told anyone about this yet.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nEDITS: Btw, I do have my bachelors",

        "content": "When I graduated in 2023, I applied for a backend Java role. My resume was about SpringBoot projects. One of the companies I contacted asked about JVM, databases, and made me do LeetCode problems. I got the offer later and accepted it considering the fair salary. But I thought my role was to do Java backend development.\n\nHowever, when I got into the company, I found out that they were using GWT (Google Web Toolkit) to build both frontend and backend, and I was assigned to GWT front end to develop web applications and desktop applications.\n\nFor your reference, GWT means developing frontend and backend using Java alone. The frontend is trans-compiled into JS code by the GWT compiler from Java code. Google used it to build Google Docs.\n\nThe technology-GWT is already abandoned by Google, and nobody is using that anymore. I felt very pressured about my current situation but was afraid to jump to other positions because I thought I would not competitive, and jumping too fast would be a stain on my resume as a new graduate. And I also hesitated about the thought of going for a master's degree.\n\nAnd this is a vicious downward spiral. The more I delay finding a real Java backend position, the less valuable I become on the job market.\n\nHaving stayed at the role for two years, now I did realize my situation, and I think the correct solution is try to jump to other companies as soon as possible. And I think the master's degree solution has more disadvantages in terms of accumulation of savings, so I abandoned it.\n\nStill, I feel very anxious about starting finding jobs, because apparently working experience is the most valuable thing on the job market. If I apply for a front-end job (that is what I'm doing with GWT), nobody wants a Java programmer because the market needs React.js and JavaScript programmer. If I apply for a back-end job, my working experience is useless too because I didn't do SpringBoot.\n\nI think I am really in a very disadvantageous situation now. I wonder how you view my situation, and I would appreciate it if you have suggestions for me.",

I was told I was required to only go in person once a month, that I could start working whenever if I completed 8 hours (so if I start at 9am, I would work until 7pm (2 hours for lunch)), and that my ONLY GOAL IS TO LEARN. When I started working, things were a bit different I am required to go twice a week (any that I choose tho) and I do have to work from 8 to 5. I just coped with it and started working accepting the new conditions, I was happy, I usually disconnect at 5pm and study German and do some certifications so I can improve at my job :) I had no clear, measurable goals but I didn’t mind it, after all, I am completely new to the labor market. I got assigned to basically help out a senior who didn’t quite give me much responsibility, I did some architectural initiatives and digital transformation little projects fitting for an intern job. But he didn’t give me a lot of them and mostly told me to help out with documentation, which I didn’t mind that much because after all it is necessary. Never had a bad feedback, I even presented all I worked on to my boss and she told me that all was rly good and if I was comfortable in the company which I responded to with a yes. \n\nHR decided to call me two weeks ago to tell me that I wasn’t gonna have my contract renewed because they asked my boss and she told them no because I lacked “motivation”, they were even impressed with me not knowing my boss had felt this. I felt like it was totally my fault but bit by bit I am thinking I am not the one that did everything wrong and that it is completely my fault. Also, we have a new boss (boss of my boss) and this guy totally skips my direct boss to text me always outside working hours (once it was 6 pm, another at 7 and the most recent was a message this Friday at 9pm) which I always reply at 8am in the morning, and he never replies until he just texts me days after after working hours once again, am I wrong here? I asked my mother and she ask me I had to always reply and she even got mad because I told her that it was outside my working hours. What can I do for future opportunities and what can I expect in the future? Am I in the wrong?",

It's helpful for writing simple tests or creating simple utilities and classes but the moment things get really complex it just end up in loops and it never achieves what I want. Most of the time it gets to the point where I need to split up the task into super tiny granular prompts and at that point it's just faster for me to do the job myself.\n\nAre there people here who work in big codebases that find it helpful aside from writing simple tests and utilities? What I mean is building full fledged features by vibe coding. My company is really pushing us to build features purely by writing prompts and even though I want it to work it's just unproductive if I have to write extremely granular prompts.",

        "content": "Hey all! A few years ago, when the employment market shifted with COVID, I landed a great, well-salaried remote software engineering job. With the added flexibility, my wife and I decided to move back to our hometown and bought a house.\n\nIt's been about four years now, and I think I'm realizing I'm tired of the isolation it creates in my life. Not only do I feel siloed at work and a bit excluded from upward movement, but I'm also realizing I don't quite fit into my hometown's social fabric as I'd assumed, especially with my job being so different from the local trades.\n\nI'm realizing I want to work in person again. I miss the daily camaraderie with other engineers, the energy of a stricter schedule, and even the minor corporate politics that somehow keep everyone alert. Remote work has made me a bit lax, and while I still deliver good work, I'm not sure I like this more relaxed pace.\n\nI could always move a couple of hours back to my old metro area, but it's still fairly small. I'm interested in trying a larger city with more tech companies and less friction in the job market (not implying it's easier to get a job, just more options).\n\nHowever, having bought a house, moving is a bit more complex and expenses are now quite a bit higher. It's not as easy to pick up and move as when I was renting and had less stuff. I'm curious if any of you have gone through something similar and would have any tips. Did you use a new job to manage a relocation, or did you make it work without having to move jobs? Any tips, regrets, or expectations that either held true or were broken? I'm eager to hear about others' experiences.\n\nEDIT: Most comments received have been about cost of living. I'm very financially aware that moving somewhere more populated correlates with an increase in housing cost. I'm more interested in experiences others have had; please don't suggest I'm naive and that if I only looked at the numbers harder, I'd realize I'm crazy for wanting to do what I've outlined above. I'm not. It's truly a case of suffocating from the isolation of remote work and a small town; an increase in cost of living is something I can afford and would happily do so if it helps me feel more integrated with other people around me.",

For some reason, on the first day I started, I was given the loaner laptop and I had to set up using instructions that have not been updated in a while. It took two days to set up the environment using tools I had never worked with and it was very frustrating. The IT department eventually wanted the loaner back so I got a different computer that had to be set up again. My manager and the other intern are very nice and have been helping me but I feel like a clueless child and like I'm bothering them. I worked so hard to get this internship and I don't want to be let go from it because I did not learn fast enough. I feel frustrated an nervous and feel like I need alot of hand holding.",

        "content": "Hi folks,  \nI'm a software engineer with 3 YOE. I recently passed the AWS L5 loop but was down-leveled to L4. Unfortunately, there’s no team match available in my region at the moment. The recruiter mentioned they’re actively reaching out to hiring managers and will update me if anything comes up in the next six months.\n\nThis is my first time going through this kind of situation. Are there any ways I can improve my chances of getting a team match or speed up the process? How likely is it to get matched within this window?\n\nAdditionally, I have a few questions:\n\n1. I initially gave a salary expectation in the 50th–75th percentile for L4 (based on levels.fyi). Would it help to tell the recruiter I’m open to less, as I care more about the opportunity to grow at AWS than compensation?\n2. I’ve seen suggestions to regularly follow up with the recruiter. Is weekly follow-up too frequent? Should I reach out by phone or email? Should I inform them if I see newly opened roles that interest me?\n3. Is there any way to get in touch with hiring managers directly to advocate for myself?\n\nAny insights or suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

I want to get better at just shutting off work brain once I leave the office but it feels impossible. The recent anxiety and frustration I have been feeling because of being stuck in a role I don’t enjoy never goes away and only gets worse. \n\nI really want to be like one of those people who think of their job as just a job that earns them money and are able to spend their personal time on non work related things.

If not physically exhausted, I am always too mentally exhausted to spend my time in anything actually fulfilling outside of work.  \n\nI am already starting to feel the beginnings of a burnout as a result of all this so I want to fix this before things get worse.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "To begin with, im a developer with almost 10 yoe. Started with a bachelors and during fulltime work managed to get my masters. I dont have a lot of certificates, because i dont work for consultancy and have been at my current employer for almost 7 years. I do have experience with a lot of tools/frameworks like AWS but like i said no certification.\nAlso based in Europe.\n\nI recently went on interview at a few companies and most of them asked for certifications. Both for consultancy and not. Even though I managed to give them a detailed explanation of things, they kept asking why i didnt pursue certifications.\n\nThe last few days I have been reading a lot of topics around this subject. And there doesnt seem to be a straightforward answer. Some say experience > certifications. Some say its a red flag if someone has a lot of certifications. And you have people that swear by certifications.\n\nNow Im a bit into my doubting phase. Whats true and whats not? In the last two months I have been focussing on certifications, managed to get two, and at the end of this year I hope to get another three. The two were rather easy since i have had experience with them for years. Is this also a red flag? If someone gets a lot of certifications in a year?\nBecause now im doubting myself.\n\nWhat are your experiences on this topic?",

Most of discussions I see on Reddit compare the two extremes: pre-Series B start-up vs company with 50,000 employees. I am interested in scale-up (say, 300 - 2,000 employees). I have a few questions:\n\n\\- How fast do such companies operate?\n\n\\- How much politics and bureaucracy is there?\n\n\\- Are different functions heavily compartmentalized and siloed? My major pain point as a Data Scientist in a large company is an extremely slow process to deploy my models due multiple teams needed in this process while I could hypothetically do it all myself.\n\n\\- How slow is planning process? Is main strategic planning done in terms of half-years, quarters, months or weeks?\n\n\\- How is company culture? Is it very different from the usual big company blame-evasion culture?\n\n\\- Does approved tech stack put significant constraints on your ability to operate effectively and efficiently? Is there even such a thing as \"approved tech stack\"?",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hello everyone, I'm here to ask for some advice about an opportunity to quit freelancing for a full-time role.\n\nA bit of background: I'm a EU-based freelance designer with about 11 years of experience, 7 of which as a freelancer. I currently work with 5–6 US-based companies (mostly SaaS and tech) and have long-term relationships with most of them. This setup allows me to earn a great income and gives me a lot of freedom. It's also pretty low-risk, since I'm not dependent on a single client.\n\nOne of my clients — a growing fintech startup — is pushing hard to bring me on full-time. They’ve interviewed other candidates but seem set on me. They’re offering a high-paying contract (contractor status, not employed) that would exceed my current income slightly.\n\nI’m torn for a few reasons:\n\n* I really enjoy the freedom of freelancing — no need to ask for time off, minimal meetings, full control of my schedule.\n* But I also deal with a lot of context switching, which is mentally exhausting. Part of me dreams of focusing on one product.\n* Going full-time would mean dropping other clients, which puts me in a more vulnerable position if things don’t work out.\n\nHas anyone here gone from freelancing to a full-time role (especially as a contractor)? What was your experience like? Any regrets, or did it feel like the right call?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts!",
