        "content": "Hey¬†r/dataengineering ¬†üëã\n\nI‚Äôve spent most of my career working with databases, and one thing that‚Äôs always bugged me is how hard it is for AI agents to work with them. Whenever I ask Claude or GPT about my data, it either invents schemas or hallucinates details. To fix that, I built¬†[ToolFront](https://docs.toolfront.ai/). It's a free and open-source Python library for creating lightweight but powerful retrieval agents, giving them a safe, smart way to actually understand and query your database schemas.\n\n# So, how does it work?\n\nToolFront equips your agents with 2 read-only database tools that help them explore your data and quickly find answers to your questions. You can either use the built-in MCP server, or create your own custom retrieval tools.\n\n# Connects to¬†everything\n\n* 15+ databases and warehouses, including: Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL & more!\n* Data files like CSVs, Parquets, JSONs, and even Excel files.\n* Any¬†API with an OpenAPI/Swagger spec (e.g. GitHub, Stripe, Discord, and even¬†internal APIs)\n\n# Why you'll love it\n\n* **Zero configuration:**¬†Skip config files and infrastructure setup. ToolFront works out of the box with all your data and models.\n* **Predictable results**: Data is messy. ToolFront returns structured, type-safe responses that match exactly what you want e.g.\n   * `answer: list[int] = db.ask(...)`\n* **Use it anywhere**: Avoid migrations. Run ToolFront directly, as an MCP server, or build custom tools for your favorite AI framework.\n\nIf you‚Äôre building AI agents for databases (or APIs!), I really think ToolFront could make your life easier. Your feedback last time was incredibly helpful for improving the project. Please keep it coming!\n\n**Docs:**¬†[https://docs.toolfront.ai/](https://docs.toolfront.ai/)\n\n**GitHub Repo**:¬†[https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront](https://github.com/kruskal-labs/toolfront)\n\nA ‚≠ê on GitHub really helps with visibility!",

With open source, we‚Äôd likely have to combine multiple tools to reach a similar level of functionality. On the plus side, that would give us:\n\n‚Å†- flexible server scaling based on demand\n- potentially lower costs\n- more flexibility in how we handle different workloads\n\nOn the other hand, Fabric provides a more integrated ecosystem, less overhead in managing different tools, and tight integration with the Microsoft stack.\n\n\n\nAny insights would be super helpful as we‚Äôre evaluating the best long-term direction. :)",

There are no black boxes here. You can audit the SQL for every single query to confirm the logic. The goal isn't to replace analysts or engineers, but to handle that first layer of simple, repetitive questions and free us up for more complex work.\n\nIt connects directly to your database (Postgres and MySQL supported for now) and is designed to be set up in a few minutes. Your data stays in your warehouse.\n\nI'm getting close to a wider launch and would love to get some honest, direct feedback from the pros in this community.\n\n\\*   Does this seem like a tool that would actually solve a problem for you?  \n\\*   What are the immediate red flags or potential security concerns that come to mind?  \n\\*   What features would be an absolute must-have for you to consider trying it?\n\nYou can check out the landing page here: [https://dbdash.app](https://dbdash.app)\n\nIt's still in early access, but I'm really keen to hear what this community thinks. I'm ready for the roast!\n\nThanks for your time.",

The challenge is that my analytical, direct approach is what made me good at the technical work, but it's not translating well to the business side.\n\nI've tried some of the usual suspects (Toastmasters, generic communication courses) but they all feel like they're designed for sales people or public speakers, not engineers. The advice is either shallow (e.g. pace, filler words) or in theory (e.g. DISC framework) which doesn't really help when your brain is wired to solve problems efficiently.\n\n**For those who've successfully made this transition - what actually moved the needle for you?**¬†Looking for practical advice, not just \"practice more.\"\n\nAlso, I'm working on something specifically for technical professionals facing this challenge. If you've been through this struggle, would you mind sharing your experience in a quick 8-question assessment? I want to build something that actually helps rather than adds to the pile of generic solutions.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIPaUjV0Okcblh4MVkxF0kPgFww2EVQdYG7\\_cUfxQxR-Z8WA/viewform?usp=dialog](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIPaUjV0Okcblh4MVkxF0kPgFww2EVQdYG7_cUfxQxR-Z8WA/viewform?usp=dialog)\n\nGenuinely trying to learn from the community here - what worked, what didn't, and what's still missing?",

        "author": "Key_Salamander234",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\n\n\nSo I've been diving into AI for the past few months (this is actually my first real project) and got a bit frustrated with how \"dumb\" LLMs can be when it comes to navigating complex SQL databases. Standard text-to-SQL is cool, but it often misses the business context buried in weirdly named columns or implicit relationships.\n\n\n\nMy idea was to build a semantic layer on top of a SQL database (PostgreSQL in my case) using a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j. The goal is to give an LLM a \"map\" of the database it can actually understand.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's the core concept:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nInstead of just tables and columns, the Python framework builds a graph with rich nodes and relationships:\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Node Types:\\*\\* We have \\`Database\\`, \\`Schema\\`, \\`Table\\`, and \\`Column\\` nodes. Pretty standard stuff.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Properties are Key:\\*\\* This is where it gets interesting. Each \\`Column\\` node isn't just a name. I use GPT-4 to synthesize properties like:\n\n\\*   \\`business\\_description\\`: \"Stores the final approval date for a sales order.\"\n\n\\*   \\`stereotype\\`: \\`TIMESTAMP\\`, \\`PRIMARY\\_KEY\\`, \\`STATUS\\_FLAG\\`, etc.\n\n\\*   \\`confidence\\_score\\`: How sure the LLM is about its analysis.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Rich Relationships:\\*\\* This is the core of the semantic layer. The graph doesn't just have \\`HAS\\_COLUMN\\` relationships. It also creates:\n\n\\*   \\`EXPLICIT\\_FK\\_TO\\`: For actual foreign keys, a direct, machine-readable link.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*\\`IMPLICIT\\_RELATION\\_TO\\`\\*\\*: This is the fun part. It finds columns that are logically related but have no FK constraint. For example, it can figure out that \\`users.email\\_address\\` is semantically equivalent to \\`employees.contact\\_email\\`. It does this by embedding the descriptions and doing a vector similarity search in Neo4j to find candidates, then uses the LLM to verify.\n\n\n\nThe final KG is basically a \"human-readable\" version of the database schema that an LLM agent could query to understand context before trying to write a complex SQL query. For instance, before joining tables, the agent could ask the graph: \"What columns are semantically related to \\`customer\\_id\\`?\"\n\n\n\nSince I'm new to this, my main question for you all is: \\*\\*is this actually a useful approach in the real world?\\*\\* Does something like this already exist and I just reinvented the wheel?\n\n\n\nI'm trying to figure out if this idea has legs or if I'm over-engineering a problem that's already been solved. Any feedback or harsh truths would be super helpful.\n\n\n\nThanks!",

I believe this tool/webapp can be useful for data engineering devs and teams. I am looking for the communities feedback.

You can send success and error status to this API endpoint. Also, you can setup the monitoring on the web app and enter email(s) and/or slack web hooks for notifications. If the api receives a failure status or job doesn't run in the intended duration, notification would be send to email(s) and/or slack. \n\nSo, here is the webapp link -¬†[https://www.pulsehook.app/](https://www.pulsehook.app/)¬†.

        "author": "the-fake-me",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Let's assume we have a set of interdependent data models. As of today, we offer the analysts at our company to specify the schedule at which their data models should run. So if a data model and its upstream table (tables on which the data model is dependent) is scheduled to run at the same time or the upstream table is scheduled to run before a data model, there is no problem (in case the schedule is the same, the upstream table runs first).\n\n  \nIn the above case, \n\n1. The responsibility of making sure that the models run in the correct order falls on the analysts (i.e. they need to specify the schedule of the data models and the corresponding upstream tables correctly).\n\n2. If they specify an incorrect order (i.e. the upstream table's scheduled time is after the corresponding data model), the data model will be refreshed followed by the refresh of the upstream table at the specified schedule.\n\nI want to validate if this system is fine or should we make any changes to the system. I have the following thoughts: -\n\n1. We can specify the schedule for a data model and when a data model is scheduled to run, run the corresponding upstream tables first and then run the data model. This would mean that scheduling will only be done for the leaf data models. This in my opinion sounds a bit complicated and lacks flexibility (What if a non-leaf data model needs to be refreshed at a particular time due to a business use case?).\n\n2. We can let the analysts still specify the schedules for the tables but validate whether the schedule of all the data models is correct (e.g., within a day, the upstream tables' scheduled refresh time(s) should be before that of the data model).\n\nI would love to know how you guys approach scheduling of data models in your organizations. As an added question, it would be great to know how you orchestrate the execution of the data models at the specified schedule. Right now, we use Airflow to do that (we bring up an Airflow DAG every half an hour which checks whether there are any data models to be run in the next half an hour and run them).\n\n  \nThank you for reading.",

        "author": "ephemeral404",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "**Background:** At RudderStack, I had been successfully using Postgres for the event streaming use case, scaled to 100k events/sec [thanks to these optimizations](https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/scaling-postgres-queue/). Nevertheless, I continue to further explore opportunities to optimize. So I and my team started experimenting with Pulsar (only for the parts of our system - data ingestion specifically). We experimented with Apache Pulsar for ingesting data vs having dedicated Postgres databases per customer (one customer can have 1+ Postgres databases, they would be all master nodes with no ability to share data which would need to be manually migrated each time a scaling operation happens).\n\nNow that it's been quite some time using Pulsar, I feel that I can share some notes about my experience in replacing postgres-based streaming solutions with Pulsar and hopefully learn from your opinions/insights.\n\n### What I liked about Pulsar:\n\n* **Tenant isolation is solid, auto load balancing works well:** We haven't experienced so far a chatty tenant affecting others. We use the same cluster to ingest the data of all our customers (per region, one in US, one in EU). MultiTenancy along with cluster auto-scaling allowed us to contain costs.\n* **No more single points of failure (data replicated across bookies):** Data is replicated in at least two bookies now. This made us a lot more reliable when it comes to data loss.\n* **Maintenance is easier:** No single master constraint anymore, this simplified a lot of the infra maintenance (imagine having to move a Postgres pod into a different EC2 node, it could lead to downtime).\n\n### What's painful about Pulsar:\n\n* **StreamNative licensing costs** were significant\n* **Network costs** considerably increased with multi-AZ + replication\n* **Learning curve** was steeper than expected, also it was more complex to debug\n\nWould love to hear your experience with Postgres/Pulsar, any opinions or insights on the approach/challenges. \n\nP.S. I am a strong believer in keeping things simple, using the trusted and reliable tools over running after the most shiny tools. At the same time, one should be open to actively experiment with new tools, evaluating them for your use case (with a strong focus on performance/cost). I hope this dialogue helps others in the community as a learning opportunity to evaluate technologies, feel free to ask me anything.\n",

What tools should I use?\nI know it's a big task for a junior BUT I want to do it as best as possible.\n\nThank you. ",

Or the OLTP part of the system needs it? If yes, for what purpose(s)?\n\nThe same question obviously can't be made for customer and product related data, since those represent the current state of the application and are needed for it to function properly. They will, of course, end up in the warehouse (maybe as SCDs), but the most recent version must live primarly in production.\n\nSo, in short, I want to know how data that is considered *fact* in dimensional modeling is handled in traditional relational modeling. For an e-commerce, orders can represent state if we want to implement some features like delivery tracking, refund possibility etc, but for the sake of simplicity I'm talking about totally closed, immutable facts.",

So no API/insert\n\nThe amount of data can be significant, from zero to multiple thousands rows.\n\nI ºm using postgres temp db to store new data, old data, manipulated data in tables, then just create an excel file from final table and upload it, cleaning all temp tables during each iteration. However the new guy says we should just store everything in memory/excel. The thing is, he is a senior, and me just self-learner.\n\nFor me postgres is convenient because it keeps data there if anything fails, you can go ahead and look inside of the table to see whats there. And probably I just used to it.\n\nAny suggestion is appreciated.\n\n",

        "content": "Hey all!\n\nJust wanted to share my first data engineering project - an online dashboard that extracts monthly vgc meta data from smogon and consolidates it displaying up to the Top 100 pokemon each month (or all time).\n\nThe dashboard shows the % used for each of the top pokemon, as well as their top item choice, nature, spread, and 4 most used moves. You can also search a pokemon to see the most used build for it. If it is not found in the current months meta report, it will default to the most recent month where it is found (E.g Charizard wasnt in the data set for August, but would show in July).\n\nThis is my first project where I tried to an create and implement ETL pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load) into a useable dashboard for myself and anyone else that is interested. I've also uploaded the project to github if anyone is interested in taking a look. I have set an automation timer to pull the dataset for each month on the 3rd of the month - hoping it works for September!\n\nPlease take a look and let me know of any feedback, hope this helps some new or experienced VGC players :)\n\n[https://vgcpokemonstats.streamlit.app/](https://vgcpokemonstats.streamlit.app/)  \n[https://github.com/luxyoga/vgcpokemonstats](https://github.com/luxyoga/vgcpokemonstats)\n\nTL:DR - Data engineering (ETL) project where I scraped monthly datasets from Smogon to create a dashboard for Top Meta Pokemon (up to top 100) each month and their most used items, moveset, abilities, nature etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pz6hr8zwxymf1.png?width=2896&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c6b5b6ca15f64665fb72dc98acd4d03d665a7b6\n\n",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello everyone, I'm new to data lakes and I'm facing a challenge with data replication.\n\nI've set up a data lake on AWS using S3 for storage, AWS Glue for ETL, and Athena for queries. I'm using AWS DMS to replicate data from an on-premises Oracle database to S3.\n\nThe problem is with **Change Data Capture (CDC)**. DMS pulls all events from the archived redo logs, including inserts, updates, and deletes. This means my Parquet files in S3 have an `op` column that indicates the type of operation (`I`, `U`, `D`).\n\nFor example, if I query my Oracle database for a specific order with ID `123`, I get a single record. But in Athena, I might get up to 30 records for that same order ID because it was updated many times. Worse, if a record is deleted in Oracle, it still exists in my Athena table, maybe with multiple update records and a final delete record.\n\nEssentially, my Athena table is a log of **events**, not the current **state** of the data.\n\nI've found a temporary fix by adding timestamp and SCN (System Change Number) columns, which lets me write complex queries to find the most recent state. But these queries are huge and cumbersome compared to simple queries in Oracle.\n\nI need a better solution for \"sanitizing\" the data. Parquet files are not designed for easy record deletion. I'm trying to figure out the best practice for this.\n\nHow do you guys handle this?\n\n* Do you just accept the complex queries and leave the old records in S3?\n* Do you run a separate process, maybe an AWS Lambda function, to act as a \"garbage collector\" and delete the older records directly from S3?\n* Do you handle this directly in your ETL jobs (e.g., in AWS Glue)? I'm worried about the cost of this since Glue charges by the minute, and this seems like it would be a very expensive operation.\n\nI'm looking for tips and common strategies for deleting or handling these duplicate/event-based records.\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "Two years ago I had an internship where I had to create a plugin for an existing WordPress website using PHP. I was the only programmer on the team. My supervisor only knew about WordPress styling and the others were working in a completely different sector. I had applied too late for internships and didn‚Äôt want to delay my studies, so this was my only option.\n\nThe supervisor told me to build a custom plugin for the checkout page and I was completely lost. I knew PHP but had no knowledge of the WordPress framework. I tried reading the documentation but it was hard to understand and other sources were often outdated. The only real resource I had was a small YouTube tutorial playlist with fewer than a thousand views per video. That became my lifeline. I followed along, learned the concepts, and eventually managed to complete the task. That experience helped me understand the WordPress core and I finally started to make sense of the official documentation. In the end I built a plugin for both the admin side and the user side of the website all by myself. My skills in programming tripled in size, but of course I gained no experience in testing, reviewing and stuff. When I checked recently I saw that my old supervisor is still using the plugin today.\n\nNow I‚Äôm studying a higher level degree in the same field. It‚Äôs something like a master, though not exactly the same in my country. The big change is that I discovered AI. Whenever I get stuck I use it, but over time I have become too dependent on it. My skills became worse than ever. I still pass my exams, where AI is not allowed, but I can feel my knowledge fading. It feels like I have lost years of experience and become a beginner again.\n\nThere is a guy in my class who never uses AI and I am jealous. Around 90% of the students here rely on AI for assignments, and many fail the exams for this reason, which also feels like a sad reality, yet that guy still scores the highest.\n\nAI can be good sometimes, but it's a virus on you. If you use it too much, you can't stop. I wish I had never discovered AI, that would be a time when I could at least show my skills and knowledge, but today I feel like a dumb ass who is no different from those who use AI in my class and suck at coding without it.\n\nLong story, but it happened to me sadly. I decided to build some projects without AI and it‚Äôs been doing good. It‚Äôs like a memory refreshment. I plan to build a simple PHP framework soon, as my final internship is coming up to graduate fully. Don't rely on AI too much guys. The love of programming is building yourself. That's also why I chose this path.\n",

From zero experience to code delivering myself. :-D\nI did a small project myself, never worked as programmer or coded in pair or read a someone else's code. I also have no IT background, from blue collar to Python backend programmer.\n\nAnd now I got a very bad CR on my code. My code was working, but it didn't fit expectations well. Too many things I didn't consider. I had to modify few endpoints with few more data, so I digged into the project I don't understand fully, but I found the way where to get those data, how to validate them, format them and send them. Okay, working.\nBut every piece of my code I got to rework. I have to agree, they are right with that and I admit their solution is better, my was just 'working', but not following the conventions, rules and architecture.\n\nAnd I just feel dumb. I ask why didn't I realize that. Maybe I look dumb and they will fire me because I am really dumb and not competent enough.\n\nI have to say, I never pushed buggy code. Always working and fitting the requirements of outcome; always written and passing tests.\nBut never got aproved without reworking. There was always at least one thing to redo better, in terms of consistency, readability or just for a reason they find useful in future while I didn't see it. (Like when they consider future plans of features and they know this detail will become handy in future).\n\nSo maybe I ask for reassurance. Or for warning if I am really in danger and have to improve asap because I am not enough to compete juniors.\n\nJust tell me your opinion or your experience.\n\nEDIT: they are super nice to me, like \"don't worry, just improve it, here is how\", they answer my questions and help me. I just feel as a burden now.",

Most it is not very complicated, but there have been edge cases over the years which has made the code really long.\n\n\ntypical code looks like this\n\n    if (A) {\n        rejectA();\n    } else if (B) {\n        if (AlsoC || maybeD()) {\n            solveC();\n        }\n        solveB();\n    } else if (Z) //because person xyz said this in 1993 {\n        solveDefault();\n        if (EdgeCase) {\n            try {\n                solveEdgeCase();\n            } catch (...) {\n                moreIfLogic();\n            }\n         if ( anotheredgecase) //things not working so gotta do it{\n\n          doD1\n          else{\n          doD2\n        }\n    //dont forget about case z2\n    }    \n\n..... continued for 5000 lines of code in one single function.\n\n\nThis program is buggy, which is a major problem as it is critical software that handles significant amounts of real money. There are no test cases or documentation, only vague comments. The variable and function names are mostly nonsensical. Every time a bug occurs, I have to spend hours stepping through the code in debug mode.\n\nHow can I safely refactor code like this?\n\nMy plan is:\n\n**Create test cases**. It's hard to write tests because the expected inputs and code-flow are unknown. To overcome this, I am planning to add detailed logging to the function. The goal is to capture its behavior with various inputs and use those logs to generate a reliable set of test cases.\n\n**Refactor the logic**. Once I have some tests, I can try to reduce the nested if/else statements by extracting logic into smaller methods and using guard clauses.\n\n\nWhat else can I do? I am a novice programmer, so any insight would be appreciated.",

Recently I started working on a bigger project and I keep running into somethings I don‚Äôt fully know how to deal with.\n\nHere‚Äôs the pattern:\n\nWhen I face a new problem or I want to make new function, I usually Google it, find a library, import it, and after spending hours on the documentation I eventually make it work.\n\nThat‚Äôs fine, but later I sometimes discover (by accident or from a friend) that there‚Äôs a much easier tool or technique that solves the same problem way faster and cleaner.\n\nThe issue is: I often don‚Äôt even know these tools or solutions exist in the first place.\n\nObviously, I can‚Äôt take a full course for every single thing I bump into.\n\nMy question is:\nHow do you usually learn about the tools, libraries, or techniques that already exist, so you don‚Äôt waste time building everything from scratch? Is there a strategy or habit for this, or is it just experience over time?\n",

One argument I keep seeing repeated as one of the cardinal sins of OOP is that its structure encourages statefulness somehow. I understand the difference between stateful and stateless programs, but I struggle to think of a practical reason for reducing states.\n\nA lot of the applications of programming I can think of depend on state in some way or another (Saving and loading a game, text editors, email clients, image converters, etc.), and it feels like there is little to no point in having stateless programs as they would lack the ability to do anything because they would not be able to interact with other parts of the project.\n\nEssentially, my questions boil down to:\n\n1. Why is statefulness considered bad?\n2. How does OOP encourage statefulness?\n3. And finally, why is statelessness preferred over statefulness?",

A bit of background: \n\nBack in 2020 I enrolled in a 2-year online university program for web development. We started from the basics like logic, algorithms, flowcharts, pseudocode and then moved on to JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and React. On the side, I also learned a bit of Python, mostly basic backend and some data analysis but nothing past tutorials. \n\nIn 2022 I stopped coding for several reasons mainly due to family issues and low self-esteem. I even fumbled a trial opportunity at a company because I couldn‚Äôt finish the final project, I felt like I wasn't good enough to do a good job compared to the other ppl in the program; so I just dropped programming altogether and didn't really touch it for years. \n\nNow in 2025 I feel like I‚Äôm in a better mental state than a few years ago, but I feel kinda lost on where to start, specially with AI advancing so quickly, I sometimes doubt whether I'll be able to get a job out of it. On top of that, I don‚Äôt know where to start since I‚Äôve forgotten so much. Should I go back to basics, or jump straight into a project and learn as I go checking documentation? I'm also afraid I will rely on AI too much and not learn much at all. ",

        "content": "\nHi everyone,\n\nI feel pretty lost right now and could use some advice.\n\nI study bioinformatics, and to graduate I need to pass C++ and Python (Data Structures) classes. The issue is‚Ä¶ programming has always been the hardest part of my degree.\n\nMy very first programming course happened only after I got  into a new university (previously I was a medical student). It was super intense, and I kept getting stuck ‚Äî partly because of the new concepts, partly because of the language barrier. Whenever I open the course lectures, I keep thinking: ‚ÄúI failed this once, I‚Äôll fail it again.‚Äù Most of my progress is based on the other (more friendly) courses and repeating for a year what I failed. Not so good strategy for the future.\n\nI actually like courses focused on specific applications (like Data Visualization or Command Line). But when it comes to the core syntax and basics of a language, I freeze. It feels like all my preparation goes to waste, because instead of practicing I spend my energy being afraid of the subject itself.\n\nI‚Äôve seen the advice ‚Äúpick a project idea and use it to learn,‚Äù but I‚Äôve gotten too comfortable with Python, and switching to C++ feels overwhelming. And I guess it‚Äôs useless to jump into projects if you‚Äôre still struggling with how C++ works at the most basic level.\n\nSo I‚Äôm not really looking for project ideas right now ‚Äî more like beginner-friendly routine: small daily/weekly practices, habits, or study approaches that helped you when you were learning a new language. I guess what I‚Äôm really trying to do is get rid of the feeling that I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo much of a bio/med‚Äù to ever be good at programming.\n\nIf you‚Äôve ever been stuck in a similar way, I‚Äôd also love to hear your stories ‚Äî what helped you break through and maybe even find joy in programming on a more consistent basis.\n\nIt feels kind of embarrassing to admit this to professors ‚Äî after two years in an informatics program, I feel like I should already be past this point. But right now, I‚Äôm just stuck and don‚Äôt want to waste another year circling the same fear.",

        "content": "This is kind of a complex one, so context: \n\nI'm in my 13th semester in software engineering, about to graduate if everything goes well. I thought I always was good at this, but since last semester, I feel everyone around me talk about things I don't understand, yet my classmates act like I should understand them now. \n\nThe protect for that semester was to build an online app of our choosing in teams of 5. At the start with the theory and project planning, I was really contributing to the work, but the instant we had to actually start coding, I became nearly useless. \n\nThey wanted to mount a git repository, which they shared to me so we all had it locally with our own branches. But I straight up told them I had never done that and ask for help. They just told me to check the readme.\n\nI spent almost 2 weeks trying to follow the instructions, but it was useless, and at that point, my teammates didn't even understand what I was struggling with. I had to ask the teacher directly for help, and he had to guide me step by step to actually set it up.\n\nWith that guidance, I noticed the amount of things I missed. I didn't have it clear what a repository even was (and I still don't tbh), I thought things like node.js and java script were programs that I had to install, I never used cli in my life, dependencies still confuse me, I have never use docker, and many, many more. \n\nMy experience programming was reduced to using Eclipse IDE and occasionally Visual Studio Community. Everything else that my classmates were talking about and using were completely alien to me. \n\nI talked with some classmates at the time that weren't my teammates, and all their advice and instructions were falling deaf to me. To the point that one of them straight up asked me: \n\n\"What the hell are you even doing here, and how the fuck did you even get this far?\"\n\nThey even asked me what does anybody need to program in java, and I said confidently \"Eclipse IDE\". Their faces were filled with both worry and contained laughter. \n\nAll this time, the only things that I worked with were theory, and coding the instructions in a java file. I don't seem to have learned anything else that I should've by now. There's such a gap where I can't ask for help in ways they understand, and they can't comprehend what could I be having troubles with. \n\nI'm doing my residencies now, continuing the work on a project with a teacher as my guide that apparently thinks I can do a good job, and I feel I'm hitting the same roadblock. The protect is in docker containers that I've been trying to get to work for 3 days to no success.\n\nIs this something I should worry about? And is there anything I can do to actually learn things? \n\nI genuinely feel like I should start the career all over again",

When I did research on reddit, I saw a top comment say that you should learn computer programming first, then the languages are just different syntaxes. He recommended the book \"think python, how to think like a computer scientist\", but how else can I really grasp this concept of computer programming.

I'm wondering if there are any free tools that would be able to help me refactor my codebase.\n\nSome of the features that come to mind as things that would be helpful (which I'm hoping extensions for Visual Studio exist for):\n\n* Being able to move a method or variable from one class to another, automatically updating all references.\n   * Additionally, tools that identify tendencies of certain classes to reference each other and make recommendations based on that to address tight coupling.\n* A tool that makes it easy to compare several classes and their methods at once, perhaps with a way to color code them based on what other classes they reference and to categorize them (such as \"this method is in the right place,\" \"this method might be in a bad place,\" \"these functions do similar things but are spread across different classes instead of being in a single dedicated class.\")\n* Some way to reduce redundancy where two variables do ALMOST the same thing (I'm aware this has extremely high potential for causing more issues and is almost certainly something that cannot be solved automatically.)",

However this requires a lot of joins, and im worried its inefficient.\n\nIf it is helpful, i have attached a json style structure of my current setup: [https://gist.github.com/jokerhutt/7ba4bbd85464a4e2f7821494a685ee18](https://gist.github.com/jokerhutt/7ba4bbd85464a4e2f7821494a685ee18)\n\nApart from finding a users next lesson, i also need to figure out which lessons have been passed and which are locked. With my current setup i'd somehow need to mark all lessons with a lower order\\_index in the current unit as passed, then all units with a lower\\_order index in that section as passed, and all units and lessons in previous sessions as passed. For this would it be better to just have a status column in the lessons table / append that as part of a lessom dto for the frontend to know?\n\ni hope the issue makes sense, thank you guys so much in advance!",

I had a lot of visual learning because we had a really good teacher who animated algorithms, and explained it really well. I understood the basics so well back then, and I was able to write a lot of basic code and felt like I had a lot of interest toward the subject. So I went ahead and enrolled to study a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Our college had a really outdated syllabus, and would make us write code on paper, and had horrible teachers. The only thing I really kept up with was math. Right after I graduated, I felt shitty about just barely passing what I thought I had interest in. I moved to the US, and enrolled in a UX UI Bootcamp at UC Berkeley and liked what I studied. Learnt some front end development and got a job at a startup, just to get laid off a few months later. After that, I really fell off the bandwagon and never studied. I feel rusty. It's been 2 years since I got laid off, but I am gaining an interest again to learn. I dont know how much the market has progressed, I dont know how much the field has progressed, I dont know where to start, or what to learn. I learn things best visually. \n\nI want to have a step into the door to learn development, and ML, and backend dev. I want to bag a job soon too. \n\nHow realistic does this really sound? IS there any resources you all recommend? Any ways you have done it? I am terrified as much as I am excited. \n\nThanks! ",

        "content": "In your opinion, what would be the best programming language for someone to start learning as early as possible, and why?\n\nThis is a surprisingly controversial question in the programming world because different people value different aspects of coding when it comes to a beginner‚Äôs first step. Some argue that a beginner-friendly language like Python is best because it‚Äôs simple, readable, and widely used in fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and web development. Others claim that starting with a language like C or C++ is better because it forces you to understand how computers really work at a lower level, teaching concepts like memory management and efficiency right from the beginning.\n\nThere are also people who believe that JavaScript is the most practical first language, since it powers almost everything on the web, is relatively easy to pick up, and allows beginners to quickly see visible results in the form of interactive websites. On the other hand, some would say Java is a strong choice for its structure, object-oriented principles, and massive industry use, making it a good stepping stone to many career opportunities.\n\nBeyond that, there‚Äôs the philosophical debate: should beginners start with something easy and motivating, where they can see results quickly and not get discouraged? Or should they start with something challenging and foundational, where they‚Äôll struggle at first but gain a deeper understanding of computer science that pays off later?\n\nThe answer might even depend on age. For very young learners, visual block-based languages like Scratch or beginner-friendly ones like Python might be ideal. But for teenagers or adults who want to dive deeper into real-world applications, the choice becomes far less clear.\n\nSo, the debate is not just ‚ÄúWhich language is best?‚Äù but also ‚ÄúWhat matters more for a beginner: ease of entry, or long-term benefit?‚Äù",

I haven't made anything advanced on my own yet and i am somewhat familiar with HTML and Python and i am still getting familiar with CSS.

I love technology and knew this is what I wanted from a very young age but I think it is the time management that gets me.

I keep wondering if that is just a sacrifice I need to make in order to have more time to learn code and other skills for my degree. \n\nto give more information: \n\nAs of right now, I am taking DSA (Data Structure and Algorithms). Other classes I have taken that retain to my degree so far are: \n- Front-End Web Development\n- Network and Security foundations\n- Scripting and Programming foundations\n- Intro to Python\n- Version Control\n- IT leadership foundations \n- Web development foundations \n\nI have remade a resume that has my updated skills and classes, but when it comes to a portfolio and projects, should I already have multiple? What is the normal amount of experience and skills that I need in order to land an internship. What all do I need to have learned or do I need to put in the extra work to learn more. I see posts saying acronyms and terms that I have yet to learn and feel like there is gaps when it comes to me attempting a software project. Should I put more time aside in order to catch up? I know people say the more serious you are the more work you‚Äôll put in so how far do I need to take that in this situation? \n\nAnd just to add, I do not care to put whatever time aside that I need to, in order to be successful. I‚Äôm just having a hard time seeing exactly how much time I do need to be devoting to this and if it is a necessary thing to do, or if more skills and knowledge will come to me as the  school years go on.

(Probably the best solution I‚Äôve seen, but risky)\n\n- make a private repository for it (I think the whole account has to be private, so this is not ideal for an aspiring programmer, but still a good choice)\n\n- don‚Äôt use homework as GitHub material due to low value things.\n\nMy thing is this: obviously you wanna steer clear of ‚Äònail on the head‚Äô type of direct uploads for homework. That is fine. But if the numbers don‚Äôt match and there are some customizations in the code, is there really a problem there with university plagarism? Maybe, maybe not.\n\nI would argue that it‚Äôs worth uploading and documenting everything from ‚ÄòHello World‚Äô to the final project.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Something that I'm realizing more and more is that even at the best companies, technical skills are usually not the differentiator. The key mover is in presentation/ politics.\n\nThis is because management, even if technical, don't have the time or ability to actually understand the work that is being done. At best, they get a high-level understanding of it. How that work is presented is much more important than the actual quality or quantity of work being done.\n\nWhen it comes to quality, it often looks better to build something passable that breaks a year later and do it fast than to build something that lasts a decade but takes a bit longer to build. Management almost always prioritizes short-term speed of delivery vs long term quality.\n\nThere's also the idea that dev work always sounds easier than it is unless broken down into smaller steps. Everyone knows that building a skyscraper is complicated and takes a long time. Building a website or an API seems easy until you explain all of the individual pieces needed to build that website or make that API. Yeah, we'll need a database, hosting, security, handling for payments, etc - and each of those can be broken down into much smaller pieces as well. It's not as simple as grabbing a cool wordpress design and swapping out the text.\n\nI think the core of the reason for this is that the ones doing the work are often smarter (or at a minimum, smarter in that area/ task) than the ones doling out or judging the work. See: the slew of MBAs/ executives trying to slap Cloud/ Blockchain/ AI on everything without understanding the costs and limitations of doing so.\n\nSo many devs end up doing work for people who don't even understand what they're asking for. This means that the ones asking definitely don't understand what separates good or bad quality work. Hence, the differentiator ends up being presentation/ politics or the gaming of performance metrics.",

I have done everything from months on GUI only projects, full Windows services, automation testing, legacy on-prem to cloud migrations and recently LLM agentic chatbot development (actually custom and cool, not customer support). \n\nDo I actually want to move to these big tech companies for 10-20% increase in comp. Do I get pigeon holed into a single boring service? How is there enough work for 1000s of people when in a team of 10 with a never ending road map I still chill around 40 hours, never more than 45. But I also see that a jack of all trades will never reach the top, thats a little scary being a Dev with AI looming above. \n\nAll I see in subs like this are people bragging about their money, complaining about layoffs or never getting a job. \n\nWhat is a real day to day actually like?",

It is all over the place. Some ask hyper specific questions on language syntax that I frankly would never be able to answer without prior knowledge to the questions. Others ask other random stuff.\n\nAlso, because I had to change jobs every couple of years due to layoffs or other reasons, I do not have a expert level knowledge on any one language.

Just endless reviews of other people's work. Management loves me because I prevent production issues. But I'm starting to resent every \"hey can you quick review this\" message. It's never quick. It's never just one. Tried delegating some reviews and using tools like greptile for the initial pass, but honestly nothing replaces human judgment for architectural decisions. Still helps with the obvious stuff though. Anyone successfully escaped the \"senior reviewer trap\"? How do you say no without being seen as unhelpful? I miss actually building things.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Every time I see people mention it, it always seems like a joke. However, when you think about it, it makes more sense than replacing ICs. Think about it, why do we have so many layers of management in an organization? It's because one person realistically can't keep track of so many people reporting information to them, so instead they have managers report to them all the way up the chain...\n\nThis is where AI comes in. Instead of ICs reporting to managers, they just all report to the AI. Hell, the AI doesn't even need to be reported to because it already knows what everyone has been doing due to monitoring everyone's computers. All the CEO or board of directors needs to do is ask for updates from the AI. They can get very detailed information or high level overviews. No more time wasted on useless 1 on 1s, you just ask the AI how you could do better or the AI will automatically give you feedback or put you on PIP if needed based on a standard set of criteria, so no bias.\n\nThat solves one problem that is faced by large organizations, but how about another one? Think about all the time spent in meetings between managers to only come up with stupid decisions because normally the loudest voice will just win out and it isn't always the smartest. Instead, the AI can interact directly with the SMEs to assess all the information available and make the most informed decisions. Think of the time savings!\n\nIn conclusion, I think we are headed for a time where mid management will no longer exist. A near flat org mostly run by AI will be the most efficient corporate structure and will out compete all of the competition. Boards of directors will be forced to implement this type of structure because otherwise they will be failing their shareholders.\n\nThoughts?",

Many responses were very detailed and thoughtful. Your insight can help.\n\nHere is a summary of the key points I took away. Some are in conflict with one another.\n\n1. A good honest attitude, curiosity, team orientated and leadership experience is very desirable. Add resume items that demonstrate this, not just say it.\n2. Hiring managers are looking for passion and self learners. Show evidence, not just say it.\n3. Build am ATS friendly resume. Keywords are important.\n4. Take contract work to build experience\n5. Follow up an inteview with additional information that supports that you are a good fit.\n6. The university internship program is the main way new devs get hired because the  organization used that to assess you.\n7. Referrals are important. Some orgs review all referrals\n8. Networking is an important way to get in front of the line. Meetups can make connections. Contribute to open source for recognition purposes.\n9. Take an un-related job in an org and lobby for yourself into the job you want.\n10. Expect to provide references to back up stated experience\n11. Business environment uncertainty means that orgs are not hiring jr positions because risk is lower with sr devs. Nice way of saying, jr positions are very scarce.\n12. The market is so tight that experienced devs available and preferred.\n13. Its a numbers game. Most candidates are similar. So just apply a lot and wish for luck!\n14. Apply as close to the posting of the job as possible. Those are considered first.\n15. Know the company well at interview time \n16. Chances are better at smaller companies.\n17. Resumes get 8 secs of attention. Nobody will look at GitHubs. Nobody looks at cover letters. Hiring managers are short on time.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I got a message on LinkedIn from my former boss saying that there was a position in his team and that he'd like me to apply. He said the work is good and the company pays well, and I really liked working with him so I decided to apply because I'd like to work with him again and I've been looking for something with better pay anyway.\n\nI started the process with a interview with HR, than interview with the director of the company in my country, then technical interview with one of the people in the team, another interview with one of the main managers but now from the US. A week after that final one, I got a call from HR saying they want to offer me the position. The pay was way higher from what I'm currently getting (which is very low anyway) and I decided to accept the offer.  I asked the guy to send it to me on a message so I have it written down from them, and that it was an ok for me. He said he'd send the offer letter and that my soon to be manager (who was my former boss) would like to talk to me. I said fine, HR set up an interview and I get a \"welcome to team\" meeting, with them even asking what laptop I'd prefer. \n\nI waited for the said offer letter for two weeks, which during that time I even asked if they needed something else from me because I hadn't gotten it yet and the HR guy told me they were \"waiting on the signature from just one other manager who was traveling at the time and didn't have access to his computer\", but assured me everything else was fine. So I kept waiting for another week, send him a message again talking about starting dates and he goes \"Oh, I'm sorry, I've been laid off last week so I can't help you\". I freak out because wtf and send my former boss a message on LinkedIn saying \"hey, I've been waiting for some time now and I just got a message that guy A is not in the company anymore. Is everything ok?\". He said he'd talk to HR, and I send another email to another HR person that contacted me. This other HR person answers me saying she'll check how everything is going and get back to me (this was on Friday). \n\nSo... I finally get another email from them and it was yet ANOTHER person, and he says he's going to see my process now since guy A is not there anymore, but he informs meet that there was a \"misstep\" in the process and I actually need to go through through another round that includes live coding on Hackerrank because that was mandatory and they didn't do it with me before, so the offer they gave me was not valid. \n\nNow... I'm not sure what to do. I'm between leaving a review on Glassdoor saying how shit the whole process was, that I got an offer, a freaking welcome meeting even and then they were like \"oh actually, forget that\" because what if I'd quit my current job after that? Gladly I waited for a formal signed letter from them, but I could still sue them (according to the laws in my country) since I have their offer on a written message and the email with the welcome meeting setup. Or if I should go ahead and do this next round of tests and interviews to see if they'd give me another offer because the initial one had good pay... But I'm still so pissed at them for the whole thing, it was a complete mess and I'm honestly so tired of doing these long ass 1 to 2 hours talking interviews so many times already... I know they're a real company because I've checked several places and I know two people who work there (my former boss, and another person from a previous company I worked at), but doesn't this feel kinda scammy and all over the place? What would you do?\n\nHonestly, this trying to find something better has been so exhausting... It's either no answers at all, a lot of scams (got offered a \"job\" to pose as another developer while said developer would be working on something else which is basically, well, fraud) or a complete mess like this case.\n\nTL:DR: went through the whole process of interviews, got an offer from the company, a welcome meeting asking me what laptop I'd prefer to then getting an email three weeks later saying there was \"misstep\" in the process and the offer was not valid and that I need another round with live coding on Hackerrank and interviews again.",

Now I am in a better team working full time as I finished university this year.\n\nAnd right now I have heightened imposter syndrome. I ask my tech lead every week if my performance is good, do I ask stupid questions, if I do not waste his time with these questions. He always answers all is fine and no time is wasted (He is also great tech lead, I have insane respect for him and my team).\n\nSo I feel bad I keep asking the same question but I also not sure what to do. The stress really stirms me up...\n\nI am also panicking on my performance... I feel I do 50-70% of what my colleagues with similar experience do. I try to improve my focus, ask my roommates to not interrupt but I still I can not get into a flow state. I will have 2-5h of this semi-focused time to get some work done. Other time is at best done on 0 brain power needed tasks or just other things to recharge brain (walk, youtube, etc.). I feel quite bad I can not clock in my time and get work done properly.\n\nLately I asked very basic questions. Like should the HTTP response be 200 (OK) or 201 (Created) for a Create. Why? Because I wanted to know if we have any specific conventions I did spent time investigating if YES, 201 is needed there.\n\nI was doing a PR review and had a call with another dev to discuss of the code is good (It was written by a fresh intern).

Meanwhile, everyone around me are such hardcore techies. They might as well live and breathe code and its been a massive part of their personality for almost their whole life and those same people seemingly just know the ins and outs of everything, even those not that much more senior than me. They talk to eachother about the high level things, and how each team are contributing towards the environment as a whole.

If I do a return internship then securing a new grad role is going to be very easy.

Since I‚Äôm still early in my career, I want to maximize learning and growth.\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear from people who‚Äôve been in a similar position: what did you choose, how did it impact your job search after graduation, and what would you recommend I do with this opportunity?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Clearly the projects on my resume are nowhere near good enough but I have no clue what a realistic \"good project\" is that I could make. It feels like they only care about projects that make significant money, or have millions of users or performs the exact thing their product already does and better. But all of these things feel completely outside of my capabilities? It just feels impossible, like I'm supposed to replicate the efforts of 10s to 100s of expert developers (and people in other disciplines like marketing, graphic design, etc) just to even get some people to look at it and still reject me.\n\nThe projects on my resume already took a while to make but even then they aren't \"impressive\" in any way in the grand scheme of things. When I try to imagine the type of things new grads are \"expected\" to have they just don't measure up at all. Make a meal planner web app with a group for a class project? Well probably someone out there made something better solo and made actual money with that. Make a networked board game with a different group for another class? Well someone out there probably did that exact game idea but better and also made a profit. Make a substantial mod for an old video game that required me to use assembly and reverse engineer game code? Well there are other mods out there that look far more impressive technically even in the time period I made it. (And that reverse engineering sounds like small potatoes to any actual software developer probably even if it took me a long time to figure out? Oh you figured out how to print more digits in the health bar and hunted down every piece of assembly that touched the health value to make it use a bigger data type to increase the maximum? Well in any \"real\" game that process would've been a single line change so they would just think I'm stupid for making it take so long. I told one hiring person about solving a certain bug where I actually used a youtube video of someone playing the mod to help me figure out how to reproduce it but to any real developer it feels very unimpressive, because if I coded it \"right\" in the first place there would be no bug to fix, or if I was more meticulous about every little piece of code I put in I would just know how to catch the bug in the first place)\n\nI just don't know how to make anything good, like I could make some random thing and solve weird and difficult problems and use every technology under the sun but no hiring people would look at it because if it doesn't make money or have a ton of users or looks exactly like the thing they're already making then it's just a dumb toy project to them and I shouldn't even have it on my resume or GitHub in the first place. I don't know how to come up with those ideas that attract money and users or how to fill all my competency holes without spending a ton of money (how to make the perfect graphic design and art that attracts people or how to market a thing to get all those users to use the thing).\n\nI don't know what's wrong with my attitude either, it's obviously wrong to be delusional about the quality of my resume, I have to look at it from a very cynical perspective because hiring people have that exact perspective against job seekers nowadays. If there were any hiring people looking at resumes in a charitable way then I would've gotten a job several months earlier, but that's not the reality we are living in. No amount of thinking \"My ideas are worth a million dollars\" is going to change peoples minds if in reality they are not million dollar ideas, so it is just stupid and delusional to think like that.",

Technically, the role that I do might actually be closer to a Lead Software Engineer than it is a Senior position because instead of having deep technical work I am more on a managerial side for the other engineers.\n\nI am wondering if I should negotiate my role to change to Lead Software Engineer from Senior, however, I wanted to know if there are any drawbacks. Although I don't mind the managerial side because I think it has been very valuable experience thus far, I still want to work on deep technical work in future roles and I don't want to be blocked for technical roles because I'm in a more managerial role right now.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "tl;dr: [This](https://oops-studio.com/japaneseverbconjugationpractice) is the project. The wall of text below is additional background (since the subreddit wiki said it's important to include that).\n\nI've read all the posts in this subreddit's FAQ section about what projects make good additions to a portfolio and I genuinely cannot figure out if my project falls under that category or not.\n\n* I'm looking for a job in basically any tech-related field, but ideally it would be in software development (either frontend/backend/full-stack web development or desktop app development).\n* I have mid-level skills (probably equivalent to 1-2 YoE) in all the required areas for both of these fields, but I do not have any college education (only highschool).\n* I only have a single instance of professional experience and it was just freelancing for 2 months where I was paid a small amount of money to build a custom web application for someone, but that was when I was 17 and the resulting application is not showcase-worthy in my opinion (very ugly UI and not full-featured).\n* Since I lack both a college education and professional experience, the only thing I have to vouch for me on my resume is my extensive list of personal projects (35 of them over the span of 9 years).\n* Of my 35 personal projects, only about 5 are worth showing off, with the rest being small command-line tools and browser extensions that me and my friends just used to make our lives easier and aren't very impressive.\n* Of the 5 that are worth showing off, 3 of them are hand-coded videogames (no game engine) and 2 of them are webapps. Since I'm not looking for a job as a video game developer, only the 2 webapps are relevant to the jobs I'm seeking.\n\nSo all of this to provide background for my core question: **Is** [this project](https://oops-studio.com/japaneseverbconjugationpractice) **appealing to an employer who's looking to hire an entry-level candidate?**\n\nA lot of people said that the best projects are ones that show you can solve real-world problems and build something that's actually useful for people (including yourself). The app I've linked is an application that helps people learn Japanese by quizzing them on 248 different verb conjugations. I think this project meets (and exceeds) those recommendations, but I still don't feel like it's appealing to employers, and especially not appealing *enough* to make up for my lack of professional experience and college education.\n\nThe project features a fully-custom verb conjugation algorithm that can accept more than 95% of the verbs in all of Japanese and output 248 conjugations for each one. This is something that has been attempted by at least 6 other people and all 6 of them failed (you can find their half-baked attempts with a Google search). As far as I'm aware I'm the only person to have ever pulled this off (likely because I'm one of very few who even tried). In addition to that, this project has seen more than 10,000 users (unique IP addresses that used the site for at least few minutes) since I published it less than a year ago and I've gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback on it from more than 80 different people who reached out to me personally to thank me for building it.\n\nThe problem is **I don't think employers are going to care.** I feel like employers are going to look at my resume for 5 seconds and then toss it in the trash long before ever looking at my project, and the few who do look at my project won't be able to tell that it's technically impressive or that it was loved by so many people. They'll just see the ugly UI, realize that it's \"in Japanese\" (it's not, but it looks like it is), and toss my resume in the trash anyway.\n\nI am more than happy to build more projects and put them on my portfolio (I absolutely love building things), but I don't want to just endlessly waste time building things that employers don't care about. I want a job, and I want to optimize my personal projects to help me get that job as much as I can. So I'd love some input on whether projects like the one I linked are good fits for that or if I need to shift gears and go another route. I'm totally happy either way, I just really want to know so I don't waste months of my time.",

Sometimes deeming those non-urgent tasks as urgent.\n\n3. Swapping priorities of tasks multiple times in the same week.\n\n4. Asking for status updates on the tasks I stopped working on after he swapped the priority. Getting frustrated that there aren't updates.\n\n5. Meetings that feel more like an interrogation than a useful share of information.\n\n6. Quickly jumps from topic to topic without wrapping up the previous one.\n\n6.

        "content": "Do you also feel like a chained dog in software houses, where in 90% of cases you only build generic things like an Excel wrapper or another CRUD app?\n\nI work 8 hours a day + another 2‚Äì4 hours of unpaid \"self-development\" after work. Creating boring tasks every day is simply exhausting for me. I do not change jobs because in almost every software house you do the same thing, and I also don‚Äôt want to go through 10 steps of recruitment.\n\nI would gladly work on something innovative, even for less money. The problem is that such positions are only for people with 15+ years of experience, even if the work does not really require it. Either those people were smarter at convincing recruiters, or because of huge competition companies can now hire very experienced developers for the same salary as mid-level ones.\nI think I would probably fit well in a startup. I could even work 16 hours a day, but I would expect an interesting project and a fair salary.\n\n\nIf not innovative projects, then at least some competition for monopolies (like Adobe, or browsers based on engines other than Chromium or Firefox). But it is also very hard to get into such projects.\n\nIt looks like if I do not find a job for similar money (basically scraps, but still a bit more than McDonald‚Äôs and with home office), in another industry, then I will not have a happy career as a developer, even if I have enough skills.\n\nOf course, I could try to create my own product and become a founder. But then you need money for marketing ‚Äî because even if the software is open source, without promotion nobody will hear about it, and there will be no money. This means hunger, and then going back to software houses to build CRUDs again.\n\nAnd this is exactly how I feel: like a chained dog that never goes for a walk, only sits tied up and howls at night. Except the dog at least does not have to work in scrum sprints, pressed by non-technical managers. \n\n\n*yes I used Ai, but just for clarity cuz I write things chaotically. ",

I'm treated like a fungible code slave and have to deal with the changing whims of management, bootlicking/ fakeness from coworkers, etc. Even technical management gets hung up on metrics that don't really mean anything. I constantly need to justify why the work I'm doing is important and the time it takes to compete, etc.\n\nSo that being said, I'd like to sidestep all of that and do my own thing.

Furthermore, before reading this, some might say \"did you ask for help\", I did ask for help, I met them face-to-face for help, you can say that I'm borderline stalking them right now. The answer I got is \"do some (more) research\" LOL.\n\nI'm an intern, on week 2 - this week - today, I was given this absolutely questionable codebase, the BE server returns from boolean to string to array to json value, you never know what value type it will return and it's a nightmare to navigate because there is no documentation, there is nothing, the only way you gonna know is to print the result out. There is a log system, EVERYTHING is log in ONE PLACE, the tiniest thing is also logged, 1 request = a massive file containing every single log possible.\n\nFurthermore, each request goes through 2 BE, 1 is the BE server and the other is a low-code platform server BE, and ts suck nuts, because this low-code platform has a request limit and the server is running on an unstable docker image so when either of these thing crashes, you don't know which thing crashed because the person who coded this before me thought it was a good idea to return EVERY SINGLE ERRORS MESSAGE AS ONE and there is no try-catch block.\n\nOh yeah, btw, I'm just an intern but I control the entire live production server of this project, this project doesn't have a development environment, I was tasked to research the dev environment + on top of maintaining abomination codebase + on top of developing new feature, I can literally use \\`rm -rf\\` this entire server.\n\nSo, today I was asked to fix a core function of the BE server, this BE server was created solely for this function. I was able to mitigate it by creating more sessions but this approach was rejected because all sessions have been approved by the client superiors and there is no way to change it and I CAN'T CHANGE THE FUNCTION to fix this because the function is \"working correctly\" based on the customer requirements by my lead, mind you guys although I am alone on this project, I do not received any documentations not even the customer/client requirements.\n\nOh and this job is below minimum wage in my country, I made triple being at mcdonald \n\nAfter the synopsis, I have a few questions or I need advices:\n\n1. Should I quit? Because I do have a better option which is an official employee title and a museum gig which I like\n\n2. If I don't quit? Where should I even start because while I have access to a lot of things, I don't have access to other things",

I like the freedom, but I'd really prefer to work at an early stage startup again (as long as their funded properly), but I don't know how to properly communicate all of my different skills. \n\nWhen I apply to jobs, I almost never hear back from places when I play for engineering roles, and I think it's due to not having many actual software engineer titles. Usually, If I'm applying to jobs and not hearing back, I fall back to applying to customer service roles. One of my managers will eventually realize I've got a ton of technical skills (usually because I'll build some tool or automate something), and I'll get promoted, but not usually to a dedicated tech team (with the exception of my last role, going to the data engineering team.)    \n  \nAs an example, at my last job, I started as a technical support analyst and within a month has been given access to their github, prod db, and AWS (early stage startup that wasn't handling edge cases in customer order data, but also wasn't fixing it, so I did.) That snowballed to me building a bunch of internal tools for the customer service team that were previously only able to be handled by the backend engineers, and eventually becoming a data engineer. \n\n  \nAt another job, I was hired as a customer service rep and saw how tedious a monthly compliance report was to create, so I built an ETL pipeline in python (without knowing it at the time) that turned a 3 day ordeal into a 20 minute gut check. \n\n  \nI'm great at root cause analysis, designing a fix, and implementing it (with consent from the appropriate teams). I've never come across a topic/skill that I can't quickly learn, but also have no issue asking questions on things I'm confused about. I'm good at seeing gaps that aren't being addressed that directly effect the QoL of individual workers and love helping make my co-workers lives easier. \n\nI also have severe ADHD, which hasn't been great for interviews. I've only ever had one live coding interview go well, the rest I start to make increasingly dumb mistakes and then go totally blank. I excel at take home tests, but even when I move along in the interviews on those, I end up losing out to someone with a more traditional background. \n\n\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on how I should market myself to stand out?",

So anyways, I‚Äôm trying to apply for stuff this year even though I feel so behind but I have a couple of questions.\n\nFirstly, what kind of projects are resume worthy? I‚Äôve made a book log project with c++ (functions to add, sort, delete, and edit books and with files) and a derivative calculator in python (made my own functions and with a gui) on my own, not from tutorials or anything. I also made a little mini game with different screen kind of like a choose your own adventure with a little catcher game inside in javascript. I thought I could put these projects on my resume but looking at other people‚Äôs resumes they seem way too simplistic. Everyone else I see has built apps and stuff that‚Äôs a lot more impressive. So yeah pls lmk if that‚Äôs something worth sharing or if maybe I‚Äôm just not ready yet to be applying to internships.\n\nAlright 2nd question, do I include my jobs? I‚Äôve worked as a front desk receptionist, math tutor, and youth counselor and also some retail jobs but they‚Äôre not very relevant to cs so I don‚Äôt wanna clog up my resume with irrelevant stuff. But also if my resume is too empty maybe it‚Äôs worth adding? Lmk guys.\n\nThirdly, is there any way to sort of get guidance on career stuff and learn about opportunities? Like I really have no one I can ask questions to and feel really overwhelmed trying to figure everything out. It feels like everyone already knows about all the programs there are but me. Please help üôÅ.\n\nOk thank you for reading if you have any advice please lmk, I can share my resume or projects privately if anyone is interested in reviewing them.",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\nI have 10 years of experience as an SWE (mostly .NET), and I've been through an anxiety train with some personal things and impostor syndrome.\nI was laid off in July and I currently have 2 offers in hand, and another 2 final interviews... so in a sense, im probably not in a that bad situation, 4 chances in 1 month is probably great.\n\nReminder that I am based in Portugal so the salaries will just be lower. Regardless of that I feel like its a good idea to start working as soon as possible to not fill a gap.\n\nOffer 1: 70k in a USA International consulting agreement (4k net for 3 months, drops to 3k net in contract). This would be a B2B contract until the office gets setup here, which in their perspective takes 3 months. This would become a hybrid role 1x per week, but its 300km away. Besides, since its a B2B with absolutely no benefits (no insurance, no PTO, no nothing, just a monthly retainer), I would have to open tax activity and terminate my unemployment salary which I have for another 1.5 years (worth 1.3k month) and I will not get it back if they fire me (which they can for whatever reason since this is California based law with 0 rights for me). I feel this is extremely risky as they can just replace me with an offshore for cheap anytime they want, and the glassdoor reviews seem spammed with fake 5 stars, with 1 star comments actually mentioning the CEOs names.\n\nOffer 2: My ex ex company offered 2k net and its a 2x per week hybrid role, 70km away, which is better. They want me to be a tech lead and grab every backoffice and migrate to a modular monolith, with .NET and React. It is a long term contract, I have been in this company for 6 years and I needed 0 technical interviews to get an offer, just a call to my boss and he straight away gave me a contract and all his plans.\n\nI am thinking of accepting offer 2, even though its lower. My plan is to just have a safety zone and invest my free time: keep doing interviews and grind system design (which I now will in this job) and learn kubernetes.\n\nAm I doing the correct thing to play safe and secure, and jump back to something better if it shows up?",

This all sounds great but it doesn't really align with my interests.\n\nI initially joined because I wanted to have some experience and I didn't receive any calls from FAANG companies last summer(tried 2-3 positions in Google, 1 Amazon and went on an Optiver interview). The other bonus is that my current team sold the projects as cryptography related, which although not false is hardly the main thing. They ended up liking me though, so I joined as a Junior for my first ever job and was promoted to Mid 5 months later\n\nI'd like to be in a more competitive/challenging scene. This for me means either FAANG or some challenging niches in CS I've found interesting like Quantitative development (and analysis),HFT, 3D graphics\n\nProblem is that there aren't many Quant companies where I live and I don't think my resume is impressive in any way to potential recruiters from there. \n\nThis is where the Research assistant position comes in. I did a few electives after my intro Stats course and my professor liked me a lot, so he invited me to join. It's basically 4 hours a day (which could be tough to pull off, being full time at another job), includes weekly discussions on math topics that are interesting and given that he knows I work full time, he'll be considerate. I don't know for sure, but I don't think academic research in Maths is my calling \n\nQuestion now is whether a position like that would sit well on a CV (perhaps for FAANG / Quant jobs), or if it's not worth the hassle\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and reply!",
