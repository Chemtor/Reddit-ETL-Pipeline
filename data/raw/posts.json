        "content": "*Disclaimer: this post is nothing but a rant.*\n\n---\n\nI've recently inherited a data project which is almost entirely based in Azure synapse.\n\nI can't even begin to describe the level of hatred and despair that this platform generates in me.\n\nLet's start with the biggest offender: that being Spark as the only available runtime. Because OF COURSE one MUST USE Spark to move 40 bits of data, god forbid someone thinks a firm has (*gasp!*) small data, even if the amount of companies that actually need a distributed system is less than the amount of fucks I have left to give about this industry as a whole.\n\nLuckily, I can soothe my rage by meditating during the downtimes, beacause testing code means that, if your cluster is cold, you have to wait between 2 and 5 business days to see results, meaning that each day one gets 5 meaningful commits in at most. Work-life balance, yay!\n\nSecond, the bane of any sensible software engineer and their sanity: Notebooks. I believe notebooks are an invention of Satan himself, because there is not a single chance that a benevolent individual made the choice of putting notebooks in production.\n\nI know that one day, after the 1000th notebook I'll have to fix, my sanity will eventually run out, and I will start a terrorist movement against notebook users. Either that or I will immolate myself alive to the altar of sound software engineering in the hope of restoring equilibrium.\n\nThird, we have the biggest lie of them all, the scam of the century, the slithery snake, the greatest pretender: \"yOu dOn't NEeD DaTA enGINEeers!!1\".\n\nBecause since engineers are expensive, these idiotic corps had to sell to other even more idiotic corps the lie that with these magical NO CODE tools, even Gina the intern from Marketing can do data pipelines!\n\nBut obviously, Gina the intern from Marketing has marketing stuff to do, leaving those pipelines uncovered. Who's gonna do them now? Why of course, the same exact data engineers one was trying to replace!\n\nExcept that instead of being provided with proper engineering toolbox, they now have to deal with an environment tailored for people whose shadow outshines their intellect, castrating the productivity many times over, because dragging arbitrary boxes to get a for loop done is clearly SO MUCH faster and productive than literally anything else.\n\nI understand now why our salaries are high: it's not because of the skill required to conduct our job. It's to pay the levels of insanity that we're forced to endure.\n\nBut don't worry, AI will fix it.",

        "content": "Hello All,\n\nFor the past 6 years I have been working in the data analyst and data engineer role (My title is Senior Data Analyst ). I have been working with Snowflake writing stored procedures, spark using databricks, ADF for orchestration, SQL server, power BI & Tableau dashboards. All the data processing has been either monthly or quarterly. I was always under the impression that I was going to be quite employable when I try to switch at some point.\n\nBut the past few months have taught me that there aren't many data analyst openings and the field doesn't pay squat and is mostly for freshers and the data engineering that I have been doing isn't really actual data engineering.\n\nAll the openings I see require knowledge of Kafka, docker, kubernetes, microservices, airflow, mlops, API integration, CI/CD etc. This has left me stunned at the very least. I never knew that most of the companies required such a diverse set of skills and data engineering was more of SWE rather than what I have been doing. Seriously not sure what to think of the scenario I am in.",

Here are a few:\n- We are in a near constant state of migration. We keep moving from one cloud provider to another for no real reason at all, and are constantly decommissioning ETL pipelines and making new ones to serve the same purpose. \n- We have many data vendors, each of which has its own standard (in terms of format, access etc). This requires us to make a dedicated ETL pipeline for each vendor (with some degree of code reuse).\n- Tribal knowledge and poor documentation plagues everything. We have tables (and other data assets) with names that are not descriptive and poorly documented. And so, data discovery (to do something like composing an analytical query) requires discussion with senior level employees who are have tribal knowledge. Doing something as simple as writing a SQL query took me much longer than expected for this reason.\n- Integrating new data vendors seems to always be an ad-hoc process done by higher ups, and is not done in a way that involves the people who actually work with the data on a day-to-day basis. \n\nI don’t intend to complain. I just want to know if other people are facing the same issues as I am. If this is true, then I’ll start figuring out a solution to solve this problem. \n\nAdditionally, if there are other problems you’d like to point out (other than people being difficult to work with), please do so.

Pulled Playlist data using Spotify API \n2. Created a staging Postgres DB to store raw data of the Playlist \n3. Cleaned the data and modeled the data into a STAR schema in a new db.\n4. Created Facts table containing granular data for Playlist- track_id, names, artists id , album ID\n5. Created dimension tables - for artists (ID and names) , for albums (ID and names)\n6. Used Genius API for fetching lyrics for each track\n7. Created another dimensions tables for lyrics (IDs and lyrics as text)\n8. Used Gemini API (free tier) to analyze lyrics for each song to return a json output. {'NSFW_TAG: [EXPLICIT/MILD/SAFE]}, {'Keywords found': [list of curse words found}\n9. Updated the lyrics dimensions to store the NSFW tagging and keywords.\n\nI have planned few more steps to execute:\n1.Use AIRFLOW for orchestration\n2. Recreate it in cloud instead of local db\ndB\n3. Introduce some visualizations in power bi or tableau to show some charts like artist vs NSFW tagging , etc.\n\nSo at this point, I am looking for feedback:\n1. to improve my skills in Data Engineering.\n2. Also since the Data size is very small, any suggestions on how to create a porject with larger datasets.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated and would help me immensely. \n",

The benchmarks covered both full initial loads and Change Data Capture (CDC) on a large dataset (billions of rows for full load, tens of millions of changes for CDC) over a 24-hour window.\n\nMore details here: [https://olake.io/docs/connectors/postgres/benchmarks](https://olake.io/docs/connectors/postgres/benchmarks)  \nHow the dataset was generated: [https://github.com/datazip-inc/nyc-taxi-data-benchmark/tree/remote-postgres](https://github.com/datazip-inc/nyc-taxi-data-benchmark/tree/remote-postgres)\n\n# Some observations:\n\n* OLake hit \\~46K rows/sec sustained throughput across billions of rows without bottlenecking storage or compute.\n* $75 cost was infra-only (no license fees). Fivetran and Airbyte costs ballooned mostly due to runtime and license/credit models.\n* OLake retries gracefully. No manual interventions needed unlike Debezium.\n* Airbyte struggled massively at scale — couldn't complete run without retries. Estuary better but still \\~11x slower.\n\nSharing this to understand if these numbers also match with your personal experience with these tool.\n\nNote: Full Load is free for Fivetran. ",

For example, if a model score > 1 would break the downstream app, you catch that issue (and then log it/warn and/or raise an exception). You’d also easily isolate the records with problematic data. This isn’t revolutionary or new - what I wanted was a way to do this in fewer lines of code in a way that’d be more understandable to people who inherit it. There are other packages that aren’t pandas specific that *can* do the same things, like great expectations and pydantic, but the code is a lot more verbose. \n\nReally I just want honest feedback.

        "content": "I would like to hear any recommendations for my future studies.\n\nI'm a Data Engineer with 3YOE, and I'm going to share some of my background to introduce myself and help you guide me through my doubts.\n\nI'm from third world country and have an Advanced English already, but still today working for national companyes earning less than 30k USD yearly.\n\nI graduated in Mechanical Engineering, and because of that, I feel I lack knowledge in Computer Science subjects, which I'm really interested in.\n\nCompany 1 – I started my career as a Power BI Developer for 1.5 years in a consulting company. I consider myself advanced in Power BI — not an expert, but someone who can solve most problems, including performance tuning, RLS, OLS, Tabular Editor, etc.\n\nCompany 2 – I built and delivered a Data Platform for a retail company (+7000 employees) using Microsoft Fabric. I was the main and principal engineer for the platform for 1.5 years, using Azure Data Factory, Dataflows, Spark Notebooks (basic Spark and Python, such as reading, writing, using APIs, partitioning...), Delta Tables (very good understanding), schema modeling (silver and gold layers), lakehouse governance, understanding business needs, and creating complex SQL queries to extract data from transactional databases. I consider myself intermediate-advanced in SQL (for the market), including window functions, CTEs, etc. I can solve many intermediate and almost all easy LeetCode problems.\n\nCompany 3 – I just started (20,000+ employees). I'm working in a Data Integration team, using a lot of Talend for ingestion from various sources, and also collaborating with the Databricks team.\n\nFreelance Projects (2 years) – I developed some Power BI dashboards and organized databases for two small companies using Sheets, excel and BigQuery.\n\nNowadays, I'm learning a lot of Talend to deliver my work in the best way possible. By the end of the year, I might need to move to another country for family reasons. I’ll step away from the Data Engineering field for a while and will have time to study (maybe for 1.5 years), so I would like to strengthen my knowledge base.\n\nI can program in Python a bit. I’ve created some functions, connected to Microsoft Graph through Spark Notebooks, ingested data, and used Selenium for personal projects. I haven't developed my technical skills further mainly because I haven't needed to use Python much at work.\n\nI don’t plan to study Databricks, Snowflake, Data Factory, DBT, BigQuery, and AIs deeply, since I already have some experience with them. I understand their core concepts, which I think is enough for now. I’ll have the opportunity to practice these tools through freelancing in the future. I believe I just need to understand what each tool does — the core concepts remain the same. Or am I wrong?\n\nI’ve planned a few things to study. I believe a Data Engineer with 5 years of experience should starts understand algorithms, networking, programming languages, software architecture, etc. I found the OSSU University project (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). Since I’ve already completed an engineering degree, I don’t need to do everything again, but it looks like a really good path.\n\nSo, my plan — following OSSU — is to complete these subjects over the next 1.5 years:\n\nSystematic Program Design\n\nClass-based Program Design\n\nProgramming Languages, Part A (Is that necessary?)\n\nProgramming Languages, Part B (Is that necessary?)\n\nProgramming Languages, Part C (Is that necessary?)\n\nObject-Oriented Design\n\nSoftware Architecture\n\nMathematics for Computer Science (Is that necessary?)\n\nThe Missing Semester of Your CS Education (Looks interesting)\n\nBuild a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris\n\nBuild a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part II\n\nOperating Systems: Three Easy Pieces\n\nComputer Networking: a Top-Down Approach\n\nDivide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms\n\nGraph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures\n\nGreedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming\n\nShortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them\n\nCybersecurity Fundamentals\n\nPrinciples of Secure Coding\n\nIdentifying Security Vulnerabilities\n\nIdentifying Security Vulnerabilities in C/C++ \n\nProgramming or Exploiting and Securing Vulnerabilities in Java Applications\n\nDatabases: Modeling and Theory\n\nDatabases: Relational Databases and SQL\n\nDatabases: Semistructured Data\n\nMachine Learning\n\nComputer Graphics\n\nSoftware Engineering: Introduction\nEthics, Technology and Engineering (Is that necessary?)\n\nIntellectual Property Law in Digital Age (Is that necessary?)\n\nData Privacy Fundamentals\nAdvanced programming\n\nAdvanced systems\n\nAdvanced theory\n\nAdvanced Information Security\n\nAdvanced math (Is that necessary?)\n\n\nAny other recommendations is very welcoming!!",

Are there established best practices or conventions by layer (raw/staging/core) that you follow for datetime handling?\n2. For wallclock `DATETIME` values (timezone-naive), is it recommended to convert them to a standard timezone-aware format during ingestion?\n3. Regarding the presentation layer (specifically Looker), should time zone conversions be avoided there to prevent inconsistencies, or are there cases where handling timezones at this layer is acceptable?\n\nAny insights or examples of how your teams have handled this would be extremely helpful!\n\nThanks in advance!",

I’m using tools I love — GCP, Airflow, Spark, SQL — and have built a strong reputation with my manager, who’s expressed interest in converting me to full-time when the budget allows. The catch? There’s no clear timeline, and I’m expecting my first child later this year, so stability and benefits are becoming a priority.\n\nNow, I’ve been approached with a full-time offer at a smaller company working in healthcare data. The role offers the stability I’m looking for, but the tech stack centers around Microsoft Fabric, which I know is still new and polarizing in the data engineering community. I haven’t worked with Fabric directly, but I understand the concepts (like medallion architecture, data governance, etc.). I’m just not sure if this is the right move for long-term growth — especially since I enjoy hands-on coding and working with more flexible, open tools.\n\nMy questions:\nHas anyone made a similar shift from tools they love to a more rigid/abstracted stack? How did it go?\n\nHow much of a “career risk” is moving into Fabric right now, given it’s still maturing?\n\nWhat would you prioritize in this situation — toolset you love or full-time security (especially with a growing family)?\n\nWhat other factors should I be weighing in this kind of decision?\n\nAppreciate any insights or personal experiences you can share!\n",

        "content": "Hi,\n\nWe're advising a client who is just wants to start to establish a centralized ETL orchestration platform — both from a technical and organizational perspective. Currently, they mainly want to run batch job pipelines, and a clear requirement is that the orchestration tool must be self-hosted on Kubernetes AND OSS.\n\nMy initial thought was to go with Apache Airflow, but the growing ecosystem of \"next-gen\" tools (e.g. Dagster, Prefect, Mage, Windmill etc.) makes it hard to keep track of the trade-offs.\n\nAt the moment, I tend towards either Airflow or Dagster to get somehow started..\n\nMy key questions:\n\n* What are the meaningful pros and cons of Airflow vs. Dagster in real-world deployments?\n* One key thing could also be that the client wants this platform useable by different teams and therefore a good Multi-tenancy setup would be helpful. Here I see that Airflow has disadvantges compared to most of \"next-gen\" tools like Dagster? Do you agree/disagree?\n* Are there technical or organizational arguments for preferring one over the other?\n* One thing that bothers me with many Airflow alternatives is that the open-source (self-hosted) version often comes with feature limitations (e.g. multi-tenant support, integrations, or observability e.g. missing audit logs etc.). How has your experience been with this??\n\nAn opinion from experts who built a similar self-hosted setup would therefore be very interesting :)",

        "author": "octolang_miseML",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I’m an ML Engineer working in a team where ML is new, and I’m collaborating with data engineers who are integrating model predictions into our data warehouse (DWH) for the first time.\n\nWe have a traditional DWH setup with raw, staging, source core, analytics core, and reporting layers. The analytics core is where different data sources are joined and modeled before being exposed to reporting.\n\nOur project involves two text classification models that predict two kinds of categories based on article text and metadata. These articles are often edited, and we might need to track both article versions and historical model predictions, besides of course saving the latest predictions. The predictions are ultimately needed in the reporting layer.\n\nThe data team proposed this workflow:\n\t1.\tAdd a new reporting-ml layer to stage model-ready inputs.\n\t2.\tRun ML models on that data.\n\t3.\tSend predictions back into the raw layer, allowing them to flow up through staging, source core, and analytics core, so that versioning and lineage are handled by the existing DWH logic.\n\nThis feels odd to me — pushing derived data (ML predictions) into the raw layer breaks the idea of it being “raw” external data. It also seems like unnecessary overhead to send predictions through all the layers just to reach reporting. Moreover, the suggestion seems to break the unidirectional flow of the current architecture. Finally, I feel some of these things like prediction versioning could or should be handled by a feature store or similar. \n\nIs this a good approach? What are the best practices for integrating ML predictions into traditional data warehouse architectures — especially when you need versioning and auditability?\n\nWould love advice or examples from folks who’ve done this.",

As the current season hasn't ended (actually ended last Saturday), I wanted to be able to handle more recent updates by just rerunning the notebooks without affecting other season's data. That's why the current season is handled in a different folder, and newer seasons will have their own folders too.\n\nI'm a beginner in terms of databases and the methods I use reflect my current understanding.\n\n\n\nTLDR: I built a database of Women Super League players using data scraped from Fbref.

        "content": "Hello everyone! 👋\n\nI've recently started a side project using AWS and Python. A core part involves running multiple Lambda functions daily. Each Lambda generates a CSV file based on its specific logic.\n\nSometimes, the CSVs produced by these different Lambdas have data quality issues – things like missing columns, unexpected NaN values, incorrect data types, etc.\n\nBefore storing the data into DynamoDB, I need a process to:\n\n1. Gather the CSV outputs from all the different Lambdas.\n2. Check each CSV against predefined quality standards (correct schema, no forbidden NaN, etc.).\n3. Only process and store the data from CSVs that meet the quality standards. Discard or flag data from invalid CSVs.\n4. Load the cleaned, valid data into DynamoDB.\n\n  \nThis is a side project, so minimizing AWS costs is crucial. Looking for the most budget-friendly approach. Furthermore, the entire project is in Python, so Python-based solutions are ideal. Environment is AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB).\n\n**What's the simplest and most cost-effective AWS architecture/pattern to achieve this?**\n\nI've considered a few ideas, like maybe having all Lambdas dump CSVs into an S3 bucket and then triggering *another* central Lambda to do the validation and DynamoDB loading, but I'm unsure if that's the best way.\n\nLooking for recommendations on services (maybe S3 events, SQS, Step Functions, another Lambda?) and best practices for handling this kind of data validation pipeline on a tight budget.\n\nThanks in advance for your help! :)",

It provides both self-hosted and managed options with a python SDK, REST API, and clean UI for queries. The focus is on accurate retrieval without complex pipelines, especially for visually complex or technical documents. We have knowledge graphs, cache augmented generation, and also options to run isolated instances great for air gapped environments.\n\n# Google Drive Connector\n\nYou can now connect your Drive documents directly to Morphik, build knowledge graphs from your existing content, and query across your documents with our research agent. This should be helpful for projects requiring reasoning across technical documentation, research papers, or enterprise content.\n\nDisclaimer: still waiting for app approval from google so might be one or two extra clicks to authenticate.\n\n# Links\n\n* Try it out: [https://morphik.ai](https://morphik.ai/)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/morphik-org/morphik-core](https://github.com/morphik-org/morphik-core) (Please give us a ⭐)\n* Docs: [https://docs.morphik.ai](https://docs.morphik.ai/)\n* Discord: [https://discord.com/invite/BwMtv3Zaju](https://discord.com/invite/BwMtv3Zaju)\n\nWe're planning to add more connectors soon.

Currently, data validation is a manual process: we review each product individually for logical inconsistencies. For example, if the text attribute \"ingredient declaration\" contains animal rennet, the “vegetarian” multiple choice attribute shouldn’t be “yes.”\n\nWe estimate there are around 200 of these logical rules to check per product. I’m looking for a way to automate this: ideally, a team member clicks a button in the PIM, which sends all product data (CSV format) to another system that runs the checks. Any non-compliant data points would then be compiled and emailed to our team inbox.\n\nExporting the data via button click is already possible. Automating the validation and sending a report is where I’m stuck. I’ve looked into it and ended up with Power Automate (we have a license) as a viable candidate, but the learning curve seems quite steep.\n\nHas anyone tackled a similar challenge, or do you have tips or tools that worked for you?

The feedback was great and really helped me think about explaining the why of the software. Thanks again for those who chimed in. ([Link to that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jp4f74/built_a_visual_tool_on_top_of_pandas_that_runs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))\n\n**The core idea**:\n\n* A visual no-code field mapping & logic builder (for speed, fewer errors, accessibility)\n* A full Python 'IDE' (for advanced logic)\n* Integrated validation and reusable mapping templates/config files\n* Automated mapping & AI logic generation\n\nAll designed for the often-manual, spreadsheet-heavy data migration/onboarding workflow.\n\n*(Quick note: I’m the founder of this tool. Sharing progress and looking for anyone who’d be open to helping shape its direction. Free lifetime access in return. Details at the end.)*\n\n**New Problem I’m Tackling:** ***External Lookups During Transformations***\n\nOne common pain point I had was needing to validate or enrich data during transformation using external APIs or databases, which typically means writing separate scripts or running multi-stage processes/exports/Excel heavy vlookups.\n\n**So I added a remotelookup feature**:\n\nConfigure a REST API or SQL DB connection once.\n\nIn the transformation logic (visual or Python) for any of your fields, call remotelookup function with a key(s) (like XLOOKUP) to fetch data based on current row values during transformation (it's smart about caching to minimize redundant calls). It recursively flattens the JSON so you can reference any nested field like you would a table.\n\n[UI to call remotelookup for a given field. Generates python code that can be used in if\\/then, other functions, etc.](https://preview.redd.it/u7co24d4m8ze1.png?width=2366&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe1f58c8462dc3db44e5390a15f7b1d7ddd6cf0f)\n\nUse cases: enriching CRM imports with customer segments, validating product IDs against a DB or existing data/lookup in target system for duplicates, IDs, etc.\n\n**Free Lifetime Access:**\n\nI'd love to collaborate with early adopters who regularly deal with file-based transformations and think they could get some usage from this. If you’re up for trying the tool and giving honest feedback, I’ll happily give you a lifetime free account to help shape the next features.\n\n**Here’s the tool**: [dataflowmapper.com](http://dataflowmapper.com)\n\nHopefully you guys find it cool and think it fills a gap between CSV/file importers and enterprise ETL for file-based transformations.\n\n**Greatly appreciate any thoughts, feedback or questions!** Feel free to DM me.\n\n[How fields are mapped and the function comes into play \\(Custom logic under Stock Name field\\)](https://preview.redd.it/m9p87z1qo8ze1.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=524aac1436d19d95a731b64b09b851b2fe617099)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/f4bw2d3o5uze1.gif\n\n",

I’m currently going through the Android basics compose course by google, am I wasting my time? I really want to do this and make this my career and become a competent engineer but I have a feeling that I might’ve let that boat pass me by. Apologies for sounding pathetic there, I will be better. \n\nI’ve also been approached by friends to build an application involving LLMs with them but I have no idea where to start there either. \n\nAny suggestions, comments, advice, or anything would be very appreciated. I’m not really sure what’s been going on in my life until recently when I began to restore order and look at the bigger picture. I’m a 24 year old male.\n\nThank you for reading. ",

        "author": "travel_through_r",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hi! I'm new here, so sorry in advance if I broke some rule.\n\nAnyway... During high school, I learned procedural programming (C++), basics of data structures, computer architecture... and as a result, I think I've become somewhat skilled in solving algorithmic tasks.\n\nNow at university, I started with object oriented programming (mostly C++ again) and I think that I understand all the basics (classes and objects, constructors/destructors, fields/methods, inheritance...) while all my professors swear that this approach is far better than procedural programming which I used to do (they mostly cite code reusability and security as reason why).\n\nThe problem is that, even though I already did dozens of, mostly small sized, object oriented programs so far, I still don't see any benefits of it. In fact, it would be easier to me to just make procedural programs while not having to think about object oriented decomposition and stuff like that. Also, so far I haven't see any reason to use inheritance/polymorphism.\n\nThe \"biggest\" project I did until now is assembler that reads contents of a file with assembly commands and translates it to binary code (I created classes Assembler, SymbolTable, Command... but I could have maybe even easier achieve the same result with procedural approach by simply making structures and global functions that work with instances of those structures).\n\nSo, my question is: **can someone explain me in simple terms what are the benefits of object oriented programming and when should I use it?**\n\nTo potentially make things easier to explain and better understand the differences, I even made a small example of a program done with both approaches.\n\nSo, lets say, you need to create a program \"ObjectParser\" where user can choose to parse and save input strings with some predefined form (every string represents one object and its attributes) or to access already parsed one.\n\nNow, let's compare the two paradigms:\n\n**1. Procedural:**\n\n\\- First you would need to define some custom structure to represent object:\n\n    struct Object {\n      // fields\n    }\n\n\\- Since global variables are considered a bad practice, in main method you should create a map to store parsed objects:\n\n    std::map<string, Object> objects;\n\n\\- Then you should create one function to parse a string from a file (user enters name of a file) and one to access an attribute of a saved object (user provides name of the object and name of the attribute)\n\n    void parseString(std::map<string, Object>& objects, std::string filename) {\n      // parsing and storing the string\n    }\n    std::string getValue(std::map<string, Object>& objects, std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) {\n      // retrieving the stored object's attribute\n    }\n\n\\* Notice that you need to pass the map to function since it's not a global object\n\n\\- Then you write the rest of the main method to get user input in a loop (user chooses to either parse new or retrieve saved object)\n\n**2. Object oriented**\n\n\\- First you would create a class called Parser and inside the private section of that class define structure or class called Object (you can also define this class outside, but since we will only be using it inside Parser class it makes sense that it's the integral part of it).\n\nOne of the private fields would be a map of objects and it will have two public methods, one for parsing a new string and one to retrieve an attribute of already saved one.\n\n    class Parser {\n    \n      public:\n        void parseString(std::string filename) {\n          // parsing and storing the string\n        }\n        std::string getValue(std::string object_name, std::string attribute_name) {\n          // retrieving the stored object's attribute\n        }\n    \n      private:\n        struct Object {\n          // fields\n          Object(...) {\n            // Object constructor body\n          }\n        }\n        std::map<string, Object> objects;\n    }\n\n\\* Notice that we use default \"empty\" constructor since the custom one is not needed in this case.\n\n\\- Then you need to create a main method which will instantiate the Parser and use than instance to parse strings or retrieve attributes after getting user input the same way as in the procedural example.\n\n**Discussing the example:**\n\nCorrect me if I wrong, but I think that both of these would work and it's how you usually make procedural and object oriented programs respectively.\n\nNow, except for the fact that in the first example you need to pass the  map as an argument (which is only a slight inconvenience) I don't see why the second approach is better, **so if it's easier for you to explain it by using this example or modified version of it, feel free to do it.**\n\n**IMPORTANT**: This is not, by any means, an attempt to belittle object oriented programming or to say that other paradigms are superior. I'm still a beginner, who is trying to grasp its benefits (probably because I'm yet to make any large scale application).\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\n**Edit**: Ok, as some of you pointed out, even in my \"procedural\" example I'm using std::string and std::map (internally implemented in OOP manner), so both examples are actually object oriented. \n\nFor the sake of the argument, lets say that instead of std::string I use an array of characters while when it comes to std::map it's an instance of another custom struct and a bunch of functions to modify it (now when I think about it, combining all this into a logical unit \"map\" is an argument in favor of OOP by itself).

It was in JavaScript, which I was learning at the time, and the most important question on the test relied heavily on JavaScript string methods, which I have never memorized (even Python or Java string methods, I'll generally look up).\n\nSo my question: Does knowing string methods off the top of your head indicate that you are a good programmer?

Later, I discovered Laravel, a PHP framework, and started working on backend development. Over time, I became skilled in Laravel and really enjoyed building applications.\n\nAs I grew, I realized that I needed a deeper understanding of PHP itself, so I took the time to learn PHP as well. I ended up creating the backend for many mobile applications and worked on complex projects. At that time, I was working at a service-based company, so I had to work on whatever came my way. That’s how I also ended up learning Node.js.\n\nYou could say I’m a backend developer who can work with a variety of frameworks like Laravel, Livewire, CakePHP, and Node.js.\n\nCurrently, I’m working at a fintech, product-based company. But here’s the funny part — even after four years of experience, I still feel like something is missing. I’m not sure what to learn next to truly grow. I've never done LeetCode problems, but I’m very good at solving real-world, complex problems that arise during application development.\n\nI also have a basic understanding of low-level languages like C++. But now I’m at a crossroads. Sometimes I feel like I should improve my JavaScript skills and learn React. Other times, I feel drawn toward AI and want to explore how to get better at that.\n\nThere’s a lot of confusion in my mind right now.\n\nI’m 22, and I still love learning and building new things. I genuinely enjoy creating. But I’m unsure what to learn next — something that will help me grow both financially and technically, and truly make me better.\n\nCan you guys please give me some good advice ?",

I then switched careers and spent the next 25 years successfully doing something completely unrelated, writing code only extremely occasionally in essentially \"toy\" environments (e.g., simple Basic code in Excel to automate some processes). \n\nIn the meantime, I sort of missed \"real\" coding, but not enough to switch back careers, and I completely missed all the developments that happened during those 25 years, in terms of tooling, frameworks, etc. Back when I was coding, there was no GitHub, Stack Overflow, Golang, React, cloud, Kubernetes, Microservices, etc., and even Python wasn't really a thing (it existed, but almost nobody was using it seriously in production). \n\nI now have an idea for an exciting (and fairly complex) project, and enough time and flexibility (and fire in the belly) to build it myself - at least the initial version to see if the idea has legs before involving other people. Haven't had such an itch to code in 25 years :) So my question is - what is the fastest and most efficient way to learn the modern \"developer stack\" and current frameworks, both to start building quickly and at the same time make sure that whatever I do is consistent with modern best practices and available frameworks? The project will involve a big database on the backend, with a Web client on the frontend, and whatever is available through the Web client would also need to be available via an API. For the initial version, of course I don't need it to support many requests at the same time, but I do want to architect it in a way that it could potentially support a huge number of concurrent requests/be essentially infinitely scalable. \n\nI'm not sure where to start \"catching up\" on the entire stack - from tools like Cursor and GitHub to Web frameworks like React to backend stuff - and I am also a bit worried that there are things \"I don't know that I don't know\" (with the things I mentioned, at least I know they exist and roughly understand what they do, but I am worried about \"blind spots\" I may have). There is of course a huge amount of material online, but most of what I found is either super specific and assumes a lot of background knowledge about that particular technology, OR the opposite, it assumes no knowledge of programming at all, and starts out with \"for\" loops and such and moves painfully slowly. I would very much appreciate any suggestions on the above (or any parts of the above) that would help me catch up quickly (obviously not to the expert level on any of these, but to a \"workable\" one) and start building.

I have no internships, no work experience outside of a decade of shitty service jobs and don't have the social skills to make up for any of this.\n\nThe reasonable thing to do at this point for me is to give up and move on, but I spent almost 8 years plugging away at this degree and would at least like to try to find a job within a set time frame. I'm telling myself that I have a soft limit of 6 months to find a job after graduating, and if by a year I can't find anything, I'll burn my degree and move on with my life.\n\nWhat do I have to study to get a JOB? My schooling didn't prepare me at all, and I was so constantly stressed out or just outright unprepared for the coursework (dropped out of highschool and was mostly in remedial classes, so I've always had a very shaky academic foundation and nonexistent study skills) that a lot sorta went over my head. I know the very basics of C++, Java, HTML/CSS, GUI stuff, some very basic Android dev stuff and can vaguely remember what a binary tree is. In other words, I barely know how to program. \n\nI've been trying to lay off the self pity a little bit and have been thinking of what I can do to stay busy after graduating and I'm going to try to find some tech study groups or meetups and check them out and see how I like them and work on a few very basic, lame project ideas I have but can't help but feel I really screwed up with my choice of major.\n\nI'm from the Bay Area so while there are a lot of jobs the barrier to entry seems almost impossibly high.",

I normally don't use AI at all, trying to learn everything myself, only asking small questions when i get stuck for too long. \n\nBut this project was kind of.. perfect? It showed how weak i was in certain areas, and I've been learning to fill the gaps.\n\nThe issue is that I've been unwell, and every time i jump back into this project, i feel overwhelmed and spend more time remembering what i was doing, than actually doing anything. \n\nHowever I've already begun adding it on github, and i feel like, as a resume-project, it may look a little bad that i started it, and paused for a couple weeks?\n\nSo I'm not sure what to do, either i force myself to cram and finish it, even just a super basic version. \n\nOr i put the entire project on hold, finish something a little smaller, to add to github, and then go back to it. \n\nI just.. feel stuck, overwhelmed, and not sure if i should just scrap it entirely tbh.

I just can't ever remember code syntax and structure.  Going from C++ to C# was especialy frustrating.  I can't tell you how many times I wrote Console.PrintLine() instead of Console.WriteLine().

Loops, functions, arrays, objects… I keep thinking I get it, and then I don’t.\n\nI’m not here to complain—I’m here because I actually want to get better. I want to know if this is a normal part of the learning curve, or if maybe I’m just not wired for this kind of logic.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of people talk about how it “clicks eventually”—I’m wondering when and how that happens.\nIf you’ve ever struggled with this and pushed through, how did you do it?\nDid you use specific tools, resources, or ways of thinking that helped make it all make sense?\n\nI’m open to any advice, encouragement, or even stories about how others got through this phase. Just please—no condescending lectures. I’m not looking for superiority contests. Just real talk from real people who’ve been there.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: Also, SO sorry about the weird username. I just noticed that’s what it was. I hardly ever use Reddit.

        "content": "I’m sharing this experience as context for the title.\n\nI've been learning Python fundamentals, and one of the topics I recently explored was working with dictionaries and lists. Yesterday, I started building a simple contact book that uses these structures. The idea was for the program to ask the user how many contacts they'd like to add, and then prompt for each contact’s name, phone number, and email. The goal was to use the name as the key in a dictionary, with the corresponding phone number and email grouped as the value. It also needed to support adding, editing, and deleting contacts.\n\nI spent two days stuck on how to cleanly structure this. I figured out how to loop based on the number of contacts entered, but I couldn’t wrap my head around how to group the 2 pieces of information (phone number, email) in a nested way that made sense for a dictionary with the name as Key. After some Googling, I discovered that you could, in one line, create a dictionary with a nested dictionary inside of it.\n\n    .update({x: {y: z}})\n\nWhere x is the name, y is the phone number, and z is the email.\n\nI felt a bit guilty for not figuring that out on my own. I had tried using a separate dictionary for the values and updating the main contact dictionary with it, but the results were messy. Either older contacts got overwritten, or duplicated data would be printed.\n\nAll of that to say, I’m wondering if this was one of those learning moments where I should’ve pushed through on my own a bit longer instead of looking it up. Where do I draw the line?",

        "content": "Hey, guys!  \n\nI'm planning to self-study computer science from scratch with the goal of reaching a job-ready (junior-to-mid level) skillset. My focus is on mastering both core CS concepts and practical skills. I want a clear, efficient roadmap that covers fundamental topics, hands-on coding, and system design — essentially the skills expected in a CS job, even if I don't plan to apply for one.  \n\nHere's my current plan:  \n\n1. Core CS Fundamentals: Study algorithms, data structures, operating systems, networks, databases, and computer architecture.  \n2. Programming Proficiency: Deeply learn one or two programming languages (considering Python and JavaScript/TypeScript).  \n3. Project Development: Build real-world applications (web and backend) and contribute to open-source projects.  \n4. System Design: Learn scalable architecture principles, database management, and cloud deployment.  \n\nI'll use a mix of free online courses (like CS50, MIT OCW, The Odin Project, and freeCodeCamp) alongside other online resources.  \n\n### My Questions:\n- Is this roadmap practical? What changes or additions would you recommend?\n- What are the best, up-to-date resources for self-learning computer science (e.g., YouTube channels, blogs, creators, platforms)?\n- Given the current trends of vibe coding, what can self-learners prioritize or skip?\n- Any vibe coding tools to recommend?\n- What common mistakes should self-learners in CS avoid?\n\nI'd love to hear from anyone who has successfully self-studied CS or has experience in the field.

During a psychotic episode, my mother convinced my brother and me to move from the U.S. to Latin America, believing we’d otherwise die in an economic collapse. Neither of us speaks fluent Spanish, and due to legal processes, we won’t be able to work locally for at least four more months.\n\nGiven this, I’ve realized my only viable option right now is to find a remote job. I believe IT is the most realistic path forward based on my skills. I learned Python 3.5 back in middle school and have been passively learning Linux since.\n\nI know there are no real shortcuts to this, and I’m not asking for one. I just want to know: based on my situation and background, what IT field should I start focusing on to work toward an entry-level remote position?",

I'm interested in becoming a full stack dev using React on the front and making myself as marketable as possible  ideally with .NET as the back-end.\n\nA couple years back, I had built a basic CRUD app using Node and Express just to get familiar with back-end concepts, but now I want to go deeper and focus my energy on tools and skills that are actually in demand. Looking at job security, it seems that .NET is a pretty good gamble.\n\nSo for those of you working in the field:\n\n* What back-end tools, frameworks, or skills should I be learning alongside .NET to be job-ready? Things I've read about are Entity Framework Core, DTOs, Repository Pattern etc.\n* Are there databases, authentication tools, or cloud services that companies expect you to know?\n* Any tips for someone coming from the front-end world and transitioning to .NET?\n\nAppreciate any insight here - I'd love to hear what things I need to learn that'd make me most marketable.\n\nThanks!",

After using PyInstaller Extractor, I was left with a folder containing several .pyc files and a .pyz subfolder containing an extensive Python directory. I’m pretty sure I found the specific .pyc file that does what I’m looking for, but there are a lot of additional .pyc files in that directory that I’m struggling to understand the purpose of. The folder that contained the .pyc files and the .pyz directory looks like it mostly has initialization and compatibility code snippets, (the application references several .pyd and .dll files so I assume this is mostly related to compatibility between Python code and a windows executable file) but I’m not sure I understand why the meat and potatoes are all in a subfolder.\n\n",

It's not normal and I think it is breaking our industry.\n\nI was talking to a family member who was a developer in in 90s, and he said any time he needed a job he would apply to 5 roles and get at least one job offer. Not necessarily an amazing offer in his words, but something. In the 2000s, he said it was a bit more competitive, but could land an offer for every 10 applications. \n\nEven in 2015, I found I could apply to 20 or 30 jobs and be relatively confident in getting an offer. Assuming I wasn't stretching myself, most jobs I was applied for I would get an interview for, even if we determined it wasn't a good fit.\n\nBut now I am regularly seeing people say you need to submit 100s to 1000s of applications to get a job. & applying to 100 jobs without getting past the screener.\n\nI feel like the ladder has been pulled up & the hiring process has become fully kafkaesque. its a regular refrain here now that you can be the best applicant for the role and be filtered out by the ATS, it depends on your luck. this system seems designed to abuse people seeking work rather than find the best applicant. \n\nFor those of us who can take advantage of our professional networks, we might still find we only need to have 20 or 30 conversations with people to land our next role. Since we can get referrals or speak directly to hiring managers out of band.\n\nBut every publicly posted job getting +1000 applicants. If things continue at this rate we will soon see people saying we will need 10,000 or 100,000 job applications submitted in order to land a role. I don't know what the solution is but this just doesn't make sense and seems completely awful. turning the job market into a casino isn't helping employees or employers.",

That’s about 1,400 euros a month, if you’re lucky. Now subtract rent (600–800 if you live alone), bills, groceries, public transport, regional taxes, and maybe a dinner or two out. \n\nWhat’s left? Enough for coffee and a mild existential crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, you scroll through Reddit or LinkedIn and see people in Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, or the US earning two or three times as much for the same job. Some even get relocation packages, stock options, health insurance that actually insures, and salaries that don’t feel like a prank.\n\nSo here’s the real question: \nIs this just how it is everywhere for junior devs or are we getting scammed? \nIf you’re a computer science grad, is there a country where your skills actually pay off? And most importantly… \n\nShould we stay and “fight”, or pack our laptops and move?",

It’s making me wonder:\n\nAre companies just posting jobs without actually hiring? Or are they hiring, but just being extremely selective and slow about it?\n\nI’m asking because I’m literally just starting my journey into software engineering and will most likely have 4 YOE by the time I even graduate. So while this may not impact me right now, I’m trying to understand the landscape and where the demand actually exists.\n\nFor those actively applying or on the hiring side — what’s the real deal in the market right now?\n\nAppreciate the insight.\n",

In the first recruiter call, they asked for my salary expectations. I asked for their range, as an example here, let’s say they said $150K–$180K. I said, “That works, I’m looking for something above $150K.” I think this was my first mistake, more on that later.\n\nI am a person with low self esteem(or serious imposter syndrome) and when I say I nailed all 8 rounds, I really must believe that. The recruiter followed up the day after 8th round saying team is interested in extending an offer. Then on compensation expectations the recruiter said, “You mentioned $150K earlier.” I clarified that I was targeting the upper end based on my fit and experience. They responded with, “So $180K?” and I just said yes. It felt a bit like putting words in my mouth.\n\nNext day, I got an email saying that I have to wait for the offer decision as they are interviewing  other candidates. Haven’t heard back since. I don’t think I did anything fundamentally wrong or if I should have regrets but curious what others think.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, in my mind I thought that’s how negotiations work.

However, I can’t help but notice how many people are not really doing what it takes, even in good market, to secure a decent job (ignore 2021-2022, those were anomalously good years, and likely won’t happen again in the near future).\n\n\nWhat I’ve seen:\n\n1. Not searching for internships the summer/fall *before* the summer you want to intern.  I literally had someone ask me IRL a few days ago, about my company’s intern program that literally starts next week…. They were focusing on schoolwork apparently in their fall semester , and started looking in the spring.\n\n2. Not applying for new grad roles in the same timeline as above.  Why did you wait to graduate before you seriously started the job search?  \n\n3.  Not having projects on your resume (assuming no work xp) because you haven’t taken the right classes yet or some other excuse.  Seriously?\n\n4.  Applying to like 100 roles online, and thinking there’s enough.  I went to a top target, and I sent over 1000 apps, attended so many in-person and virtual events, cold DMed people on LinkedIn for informational interviews starting my freshman year.  I’m seeing folks who don’t have the benefit of a target school name literally doing less.\n\n5.  Missing scheduled calls, show up late, not do basic stuff.  I had a student schedule an info interview with me, no show, apologize, reschedule, and no show again.   I’ve had others who had reached out for a coffee chat, not even review my LinkedIn profile and ask questions like where I worked before.  Seriously?\n\n6.  Can’t code your way out of a box.  Yes, a wild amount of folks can’t implement something like a basic binary search.\n\n7.  Cheat on interviews with AI.  It’s so common.\n\n8.  Not have basic knowledge/understanding (for specific roles).  You’d be surprised how many candidates in AI/ML literally don’t know the difference between inference and training, or can’t even half-explain the bias-variance trade-off problem.\n\n\nDo the basic stuff right, and you’re already ahead of 95% of candidates.\n\n",

I think they're dumb but people have been complaining about them for a decade so I understand why companies do them. I'm asking to do away with these ridiculous processes that are 5 rounds *on average* and go back to have 1) a screening call 2) an onsite, 3) and then a reference check, a process which ANY REASONABLE COMPANY should be able to evaluate an employee. Sure ask our coding questions in the onsite, but my god. I interview with startups, who fail thirty percent more often then regular businesses.

It felt more like a pop quiz than a conversation about my experience or problem-solving skills.\n\nI've been working as a developer for more than 12+ years, handling real projects, debugging complex issues, and making architectural decisions. But none of that seemed to matter in the interview—it was just \"what’s the syntax for X?\" or “how do you write Y function?”\n\nHonestly, in real development work, I look things up when I forget syntax. Isn’t that normal?\n\nJust wondering—why do so many companies still treat interviews like memory tests instead of evaluating actual experience and practical thinking? Anyone else frustrated by this?",

I would love to move to US eventually, hence why I'm not too keen in joining Huawei. I definitely enjoyed meeting the AWS team, as it's very much related to my research topic.\n\nWould it look bad career-wise if I accept the SDE1 position at AWS, since I have a PhD?\n\nEDIT:\n\nSome clarifications. The research scientist role at Meta would be a \"glorified\" software engineering position. I do non-AI distributed system research, and I found basically no research-heavy opportunities for such a topic in EU, except for Huawei. On the other hand, a software engineering job in a company such as AWS or Meta would help me gain practical experience nonetheless  ",

(got to work for Disney, amazon-studios, NBA, multiple MLB teams)  \nTook some studio training got certified. and I made money doing it. The problem is, I started working at an amazon warehouse and I've gotten very \"lazy\"  \nat first it was just to pay bills, make ends meet, but then I got benefits, insurance ect, but you're a work horse, you move boxes for 10 hours at a measly 24.35 an hour. It's not sustainable, I do want to go back into film but it's been 2 years later with only a few side gigs worked here and there as a production assistant.  (mostly because I haven't pursued anything because of financial hardship and the steady pay is worth more to me than random amounts of 1099 based pay here and there)\n\nOn a whim, I decided to have Amazon pay me to learn how to drive a truck ( semi-drivers are also needed in film too) and at the time it just seemed to be a good thing to fall back on and I day dreamed about getting to travel again and get paid to do it.\n\nThat said, I kind of don't want to see myself as a trucker for life ( as funny as an idea that was at the time as a way to get out of back breaking labor)\n\nI was from a generation that was always told learn to code ect.... What's going on with that? I have zero interest to be a blue \"collar\" worker, and I need an extra set of skills if working BTS isn't a viable long term career (its not)\n\nI just want that desk job and that 80-100k a year. Thought of going into game dev and heard a lot of \"well don't want to do that because it'll beat that passion out of you for gaming\" don't really care about passion projects, I just want to work. Don't mind my vision being shared or not shared, just want to make money. Is coding still in, is tech dead? am I barking up the wrong tree,\n\nwould it be stupid at nearly 30 to say \"Yeah I could be a game dev if i want.\" or should I look at something else tech related or is tech just too competitive now?\n\nNo kids, no plan to ever have kids, current gf doesn't want kids.\n\nIf tech isn't it then i'll probably spend the next few years buying the film equipment I had my eye on for years, building a better pc, learning editing, working PA as often as I can and doing that grind (which trust me it's a grind, some weeks I made 200 dollars other weeks I made 3200)  But I would love the comfort of a cozy desk job.

As a result, it seems like the amount of work expected to be completed has sharply increased—and ironically enough—the job has gotten more stressful.\n\nI used to be assigned several stories per sprint, and could finish them with ample time, all while learning something too. However recently it has felt like since management knows about how AI is, they load us up on our sprints, where I'm getting double the amount of tickets as I was before, and even junior developers are leading entire initiatives of our project, and they too have voiced feelings of intense pressure.\n\nAs a result of this, I'm starting to feel like my love of programming and problem-solving is dwindling. Each ticket I hardly have the time to truly think about solutions and research and learn, because I'm expected to use AI to grind out the solution and move onto the next. This has made me feel like I'm burning out a bit, because instead of learning things I feel more like a prompt engineer at most and just gluing solutions together and moving onto the next ticket, with little time for anything else because the work volume has drastically increased.\n\nWas wondering if anyone else has had feelings similar to this?

        "content": "I'm a junior with 2.5 YOE. It took me almost 9 months to get my first job because of how bad the market was (is) when I graduated. I got my current and first job because I was cheap (my starting pay was far below market rate for SE1 role), and the hiring manager was impressed with a systems programming and os architecture project I had on my resume and my github from one of my classes which was written in C. My job uses a techstack of syncfusion c# winform frontend and an old C backend that was originally written before I was even born.\n\nI've been spending my free time upskilling, mostly working with .net core & react, and python as I'd like to get a full stack or backend role with a more modern and common techstack. But problem is, every job I've applied to that uses anything remotely modern hasn't given me any call backs. The only jobs I have heard from are ones that I didn't even apply to that want the same thing as my current job does, a cheap junior that knows C.\n\nI'm guessing part of the reason why I'm not getting callbacks is not just because of how bad the market is, but because in a recruiters and hiring manager's mind, why take a chance on someone who currently works with something arachic, when you can just get someone who has actual job experience in what they use. How do I get out of being pigeonholed? I tailor my resume to the job I apply to as best I can, but it's not like I can rewrite the experience section of my resume that shows I deal with winforms and C.",

I can do a lot with it while understanding the code but not that much without it.\n\nWhat is world’s take on this? How it looks like in corporations?

Thus, my employment would last around 6 to 8 months, depending on when I start. \n\nMy question is whether I should mention this quit date during the application process or whether it's best to ommit it as it will hurt my chances of getting a job? Are companies typically open to agreeing to \"pause\" my contract for the duration of the exchange semester? I kind of feel bad if I don't mention it but perhaps it's the most strategic thing to do.\n\nAny advice or personal opinions would be greatly appreciated!",

        "content": "For a long time, I’ve been obsessed with prestige and what people think of me. Only recently have I started to realize that this focus has been damaging.\n\nBack in college, I struggled to land strong internships. When people asked where I interned, I’d feel insecure.\n\nThis past new grad job hunt season was different. I did extremely well. But instead of simply feeling proud, I found myself bringing it up in almost every conversation — how many offers I got, how hard the decision was. My close friends pointed out that my conversations shifted away from hobbies and life to career decisions, leveling systems, and growth.\n\nWhen it came time to choose between job offers, I tried everything to make the “right” decision. I asked all my friends and family. I read every blog and polled every possible forum. I was obsessed with finding the most validated, socially acceptable path — the one society would approve of. Obviously it didn’t work. \n\nEventually, I had to ask myself: *Why do I feel the need to share my successes so often? Why is this decision so agonizing?* And I think the honest answer is that I care a lot about how others perceive me.\n\nBut digging deeper, that desire doesn’t feel purely ego-driven. In tech, **career advancement almost entirely depends on perception.** Recruiters scan for brand names. Managers reward visibility. Friends decide whether you’re worth a referral. Your market worth is defined by what others think, not by what you think you’re worth.\n\nThat’s why I find myself highlighting my accomplishments and leaning toward prestige. I want to be seen as someone worth helping, worth investing in. I want future recruiters to see my resume and not hesitate. But in the process, I’ve started to value prestige more than my own long-term goals and personal values.\n\nChoosing between offers this season was especially hard because they represented opposite sides of this internal conflict — one path aligned with prestige, the other with personal fit.\n\nConventional advice says to “stop caring what people think.” But is that even realistic when almost every system in tech (and the world in general) is based on what others think of you and how you're ranked?",

Any advice is appreciated!\n\n  \nMy resume: [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kPUsPfDaqCYawwqK42IaKv6PtECA3lxu/view?usp=sharing)\n\n  \n",

        "content": "So here’s a bit of context. I graduated in 2017 with a degree in Civil Engineering. A couple years later I decided to switch careers, so I went back to school to study Computer Science. A bunch of my credits were transferred, so I finished the CS degree in 3 semesters with a 4.0 GPA and graduated in 2020. \n\nSince then… nothing. I’ve been applying for dev jobs ever since but haven’t been able to land a single proper interview. I didn’t do any internships because I didn’t know the job market would be this bad which I regret right now. I couldn’t afford to sit around waiting, so I’ve been working full-time in sales to pay the bills which makes it a bit harder for me since I don’t have a lot of free time to focus on job hunting and building projects.\n\nThat said, I didn’t give up on tech. I’ve been learning on my own, building personal projects whenever I have a bit of free time, and I’ve also worked with a small agency on a project basis (not full-time) since late 2023.\n\nAt this point I’m honestly burnt out and confused. Is it my resume? My background? Is the market just that bad? I’d really appreciate any advice or feedback, especially from anyone who broke in after a similar detour.",

I’m currently trying to figure out what kind of environment I actually want to work in long term.\n\nIn particular, how normal is it to see these patterns? I’ve noticed these either as an intern or through reviews online for other startups:\n\n* Long hours: e.g. 10-12 hours a day, 5-7 days a week. Sometimes explicitly stated as part of the culture, other times unstated but clearly expected - people work late, on weekends, etc.\n* Leadership doesn’t take accountability: when things go wrong, there's no clear ownership from the top. Just a vague sense of we all failed together.\n* Strict in-office requirement: 5+ days a week in-office, with little or no flexibility for WFH.\n* Constantly shifting direction or pivoting: roadmaps or priorities changing multiple times a month, with work frequently thrown away.\n* Unstable policies: things like compensation, time-off policies, or promised benefits being changed or walked back\n* No mentorship: you're expected to figure things out mostly on your own, even as a junior or new hire.\n\nI get that startups are fast-paced, ambiguous, and scrappy, that’s kind of the appeal in some ways. But when several of these things combine, it’s hard to tell if that’s just startup life or if it’s a genuinely unhealthy environment, especially when you're early in your career.\n\nSo how many of these are just part of the deal when working at an early-stage company? And how many should be treated as signs to walk away?\n\nWould really appreciate any thoughts, heuristics, or personal experience. I’m trying to understand how to tell the difference between healthy chaos and exploitation / red flags to walk away from.",

        "author": "Accipitrim",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi folks, I'm a junior dev currently a year into their first job at a well-known tech company (non-FAANG) in the bay.\n\n**((This part is  just me ranting so you can just skip to the bottom to read my questions))**\n\nI know I should be grateful to have a job in this economy, but I am absolutely miserable at work due to various factors (uninteresting work, long hours, toxic team, micromanaging etc.) and I feel that I've hit the lowest point of my mental and physical health. I've lost at least 15 lbs due to lack of appetite from stress. Everyone in my team works \\~50 hours every week. Maybe these aren't \"crazy\" hours, but I joined the company expecting a regular 40 hour work week, so I was unpleasantly surprised. I used to be of the mindset that I just needed to work my 9-5 and leave,  but my manager actually reprimanded me specifically for not working long enough hours and being slow on my tasks only couple months into the job. I'd say this is when I started becoming very unhappy at my job as I became extremely anxious about my work hours and performances afterwards.\n\nAll of my coworkers are much *much* older than me. And while most people have been pleasant to work with, I have also been thrown under the bus by my manager over a minor issue that was not my fault because one of the senior members of the team took a disliking of me. This happened \\~5 months into the job. I'd say I'm on good terms with everyone now, but this left a very sour taste in my mouth. Also, the vast majority of my team consists of first-gen immigrants who speak to each other in a foreign language that I do not understand at work. This, combined with the fact that I'm the only junior in my team, makes me feel very out of place.\n\nI still plan on staying here for at least for a year so that I could keep my sign-on, but I flirt with the idea of quitting without any backup plan if it comes to that, though I likely never will given the state of the economy (alternatively, get hit by a car on the way to work). The pay is on the lower end of the average for the bay area and I also got a rather low annual raise, which has been one of the final straws for me.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\nI know that the biggest issue right now is that the job market for any entry level SWE is very saturated. However, I'm also a bit confused on how to start applying for jobs as someone with a full-time work experience:\n\n* Which roles do I even apply for? Should I still be applying to New Grad roles? I've heard that 1 YOE is not much different from New Grad. Based on what I have seen, most job postings have been only for mid to senior level roles. There doesn't seem to be many entry level roles that are posted year round. A lot of generic SWE roles still require 2 to 3+ YOE in the description. Should I still shoot my shot regardless? Or would it just be a waste of time?\n* Is it okay for my resume to be similar to what I had from college (ie. work experience, college projects, and engineering-related extracurriculars) with just the addition of my work as a full time engineer?\n* If I switch jobs before my first promotion at the company, would this set me back a year in terms of promotion? But to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll even get promoted in this team since my manger seems to have a bad impression of me.",

Learning how memory parsing works, stacks, operating systems, algorithms and being able to create tools and tear software apart would be awesome. \n\nIt's also a source of insecurity for me, I tried university before I started work and failed pretty hard.

I recently turned 30 and am struggling with the reality that I don’t have professional experience in my field. Most of my work has been tied to school projects, so my portfolio isn’t as strong as I’d like.\n\nWhile I don’t consider myself the best or smartest (sometimes I feel the exact opposite), I’ve always been quick to understand things. I’m good at breaking down complex problems, and I’ve received praise for it my entire life. However, discipline has always been a challenge for me. I’ve managed to get by relying on my intellect while doing far less work than I should have. But recently, I’ve started implementing good routines and becoming productive every day.\n\nI’m an international student in the U.S., working toward my master’s in Math with a concentration in Computer Science, and my bachelor’s degree was also in CS. All I need to do to graduate is submit my thesis. The pressure is mounting because my time to stay in the country is running out unless I secure a job soon. I’m actually being forced to start using my OPT (limited work eligibility) time to submit my thesis by December and graduate.\n\nI feel overwhelmed trying to figure out how to compete in the job market despite these challenges. For reference, I’m currently near Houston, Texas. So far, I’ve applied to fewer than 50 jobs. Most of the time, I don’t get responses - sometimes I get rejections - but I’ve never had an interview.\n\nFor those who have been in similar situations - or those who’ve successfully transitioned into a career without much experience - how did you do it? Can I make my school projects look more compelling to employers? Will they even look at them? Do I have a chance?\n\nI know that if I’m given an opportunity in a work environment, I’ll reach a high-performance level very quickly. I just don’t know how to show this potential to employers. I also can’t seem to get my resume under two pages.\n\nAny advice on networking (which I’ve struggled with as an introvert with few close friends), skill-building, or navigating job searches efficiently would be incredibly helpful.\n\nFinally, thank you whoever you are for taking the time to read this. I’m crossing my fingers for something that gives me hope - that I haven’t completely wasted my life and opportunity here. In the meantime, I'm making small victories, like finally maintaining a steady routine of working on my thesis and working on my resume/linkedIn/applying for jobs full-time.",

        "author": "Wonderful_Analyst_50",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I graduated college with a bachelors degree in computer science a while ago and ever since I’ve been living with my parents while doing delivery services like Instacart and uber eats to make money while I try to search for a job as a software engineer. As you can guess I haven’t really gotten anywhere with that. I even attended a software engineering bootcamp last year to try to bolster my resume (may not have been the smartest idea in hindsight but I enjoyed it and met some cool people so I don’t regret it) but still nothing. \n\nMy family is now trying to push me to apply for a masters program focusing on something like cybersecurity or biotech (which feels a little outside my comfort zone as I wasn’t great at biology) claiming the masters is the final piece I need to make it all come together. Honestly the thought of putting so much more time and money into a field that has had fruitless returns so far gives me a ton of anxiety and I don’t want to come out the other side of it multiple years from now tens of thousands of dollars in debt and be in the same position I’m in now. I was lucky enough that I could get my bachelors degree mostly for free due to my father’s VA benefits but I’d be too old to qualify for that once I get into a masters program so I’d be paying full price this time around. I also burned out pretty hard towards the end of my bachelors (partially due to Covid) and pretty much dragged myself across the finish line so the thought of going back after a few years away is pretty daunting.\n\nUltimately though I know I need to do something and I’m sick and tired of the position I’m in. I feel like I’ve put my life on hold for years trying to start it from the best position possible and I’m at a point where it just doesn’t feel viable anymore. Living with my parents for this long just doing deliveries and job applications every day has made me pretty depressed and I kind of just want to get a regular non-tech job, move out into an apartment with a friend, and figure out my life from there. At the same time though I feel like if a masters degree would genuinely be very useful in the long run, I’m being short sighted and years from now I’d regret not getting it. Especially considering my parents are willing to keep housing me while I go back to school so I’d probably be making my life more difficult by moving out instead, even if it would probably improve my mental health.\n\nI do genuinely enjoy coding and would consider myself pretty good at it, but I wouldn’t say I’m passionate about it or anything. I don’t really feel passionate about anything really, I kinda just want to have a good life making comfortable money and not hating my job. When I changed my major to computer science it seemed like a pretty straight shot, I enjoyed it more than my other classes, I was naturally very good at it, and there seemed to be a pretty direct path of internship (check) -> degree (check) -> high paying job (crash and burn). The market crash happened right before I graduated so I found it to be extremely unlucky timing and have pretty much been trying to play catch up ever since.\n\nBasically I’m just looking to see if anyone has any thoughts on the usefulness of a masters degree in the current market and if it would be a good use of my time and money or not. Or maybe even if there’s any CS related jobs I could get with my current degree that I may have overlooked so far (I’ve mainly been focusing on full stack development). Any advice is very appreciated.\n\n\nTLDR: I’m wondering if a masters degree is worth the time and money in this current tech market or if there are any other type of CS jobs I could get with my bachelors that are commonly overlooked. Or should I just cut my losses, find a non-tech job, move into an apartment with a friend, and try to figure out my life from there.",

        "content": "My background - I have a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering. During my Bachelor's, I had learned Java and OOPS concepts through self-instruction and online resources. After that, I have 4 years of experience in an IT Consulting firm - my job title said \"Consultant.\" I mostly worked on production support (incident management and bug fixes) for client projects, primarily on the backend which for the most part, involved a Java-based low code integration development platform and Oracle DB/SQL on the database side. Occasionally, I would use Core Java as and when needed. I also got familiar with version control and CICD concepts.\n\n\n\nWhile working on this job, I had been parallelly doing a lot of self learning on fundamental CS topics like Data Structures, Algorithm design and analysis. I eventually left to pursue a Master's in Computer Science where I am currently enrolled. Today, an Amazon recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn to set up an SDE-2 interview. I have been practicing LeetCode and intend to complete at least the Neetcode 150 and Blind 75 in the coming days. My Master's coursework has involved a lot of Low Level Design/Object Oriented Design Patterns and I have been learning High Level System Design from online lecture videos.\n\n\n\nHowever, I am not sure if my earlier work experience makes me suitable for an SDE-2 role at Amazon. I haven't really done any significant System Design in my previous role and I am not sure how to deal with the Behavioral/Leadership Principles based rounds where they question you about your earlier work experiences.\n\n\n\nAs I'll be graduating from an MSCS program soon, should I ask the recruiter for an SDE-1 role instead? I'm not sure if she even recruits for SDE-1 and it's not clear if down leveling to SDE-1, in case I meet the SDE-1 bar but not the SDE-2 one, after the interview is an option. I would greatly appreciate any insights on what is advisable given my background. Thank you!",
