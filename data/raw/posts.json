        "author": "BoredAt",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "This is a long article, so sit down and get some popcorn üôÇ\n\nAt this point everyone here has already read of the newest merger on the block. I think it's been (at least for me) a bit difficult to get the full story of why and whats going. I‚Äôm going to try to give what I suspect is really going on here and why it's happening.\n\n*TLDR: Fivetran is getting squeezed on both sides and DBT has hit its peak, so they‚Äôre trying to merge to take a chunk off the warehouses and reach Databricks valuation (10b atm -> 100b Databricks/Snowflake)*\n\nFirst, a collect of assumptions from my side:\n\n* Fivetran is getting squeezed at the top by warehouses (Databricks, Snowflake) commoditizing EL for their enterprise contracts. Why ask your enterprise IT team to get legal to review another vendor contract (which will take another few 100ks of the budget) when you can do just 1 vendor? With EL at cost (cause the money is in query compute, not EL)?\n* Fivetran is getting squeezed at the bottom by much cheaper commoditized vendors (Airbyte, DLTHub, Rivery, etc.)\n* DBT has peaked and isn‚Äôt really growing much.\n\n\nFor the first, the [proof](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/what-is-open-data-infrastructure) from DBTs article:\n\n> As a result, customers became frustrated with the tool-integration challenges and the inability to solve the larger, cross-domain problems. Customers began demanding more integrated solutions‚Äîasking their existing vendors to ‚Äúdo more‚Äù and leave in-house teams to solve fewer integration challenges themselves. Vendors saw this as an opportunity to grow into new areas and extend their footprints into new categories. This is neither inherently good nor bad. End-to-end solutions can drive cleaner integration, better user experience, and lower cost. But they can also limit user choice, create vendor lock-in, and drive up costs. The devil is in the details.\n\n> In particular, the data industry has, during the cloud era, been dominated by five huge players, each with well over $1 billion in annual revenue: Databricks, Snowflake, Google Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure. Each of these five players started out by building an analytical compute engine, storage, and a metadata catalog. But over the last five years as the MDS story has played out, each of their customers has asked them to ‚Äúdo more.‚Äù And they have responded. Each of these five players now includes solutions across the entire stack: ingestion, transformation, notebooks and BI, orchestration, and more. They have now effectively become ‚Äúall-in-one data platforms‚Äù‚Äîbring data, and do everything within their ecosystem.\n\nFor the second point, you only need to go to the pricing page of any of the alternatives. Fivetran is expensive, plan and simple. For the third, I don‚Äôt really have any formal proof. You can take it as my opinion I suppose.\n\nWith those 3 facts in mind, it seems like the game for DBTran (I‚Äôm using that name from now one üôÇ) is then to try to flip the board on the warehouses. Normally, the data warehouse is where things start, with other tools (think data catalogs, transformation layer, semantic layer, etc.) being an add on that they try to commoditize. This is why snowflake and databricks are worth 100b+. Instead, DBTran is trying to make the warehouse be the commodity. This is namely by using a somewhat new tech. Iceberg (not gonna explain iceberg here, feel free to read that elsewhere).\n\n\nIf Iceberg is implemented, then compute and storage are split. The traditional warehouse vendors (bigquery, clickhouse, snowflake, etc.) are simply compute engines on top of the iceberg tables. Merely another component that can be switched out at will. Storage is an s3 bucket. DBTran would then be the rest. It would look a bit like:\n\n* Storage - **S3, GCS, etc.** \n* Compute - **Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.**\n* Iceberg Catalog - **DBTran**\n* EL - **DBTran**\n* Transformation Layer - **DBTran**\n* Semantic Layer - **DBTran**\n\nThey could probably add more stuff here. Buy Lightdash maybe and get into BI? But I don‚Äôt imagine they would need to (not a big enough market). Rather, I suspect they want to take a chunk off the big guys. So get that sweet, sweet compute enterprise budget by carving them out in half and eating it.\n\nSo should anyone in this subreddit care? I suppose it depends. If you don‚Äôt care about what tool you use, its business as usual. You‚Äôll get something for EL, something for T and so on. Data engineering hasn‚Äôt fundamentally changed. If you care about OSS (which I do) then this is worth watching. I‚Äôm not sure if this is good or bad. I wouldn‚Äôt switch to DBT Fusion anytime soon. But if by any chance DBTran make the semantic layer and the EL OSS (even on an elastic license) then this might actually be a good thing for OSS. Great even.\n\nBut I wouldn‚Äôt bet on that. DBT made Metricsflow proprietary. Fivetran is proprietary. If you want OSS, its best to look elsewhere.",

        "content": "\n\nI‚Äôve been following (and using) the Apache Iceberg ecosystem for a while now. Early on, I had the same mindset most teams do: files + a simple SQL engine + a cron is plenty. If you‚Äôre under \\~100 GB, have one writer, a few readers, and clear ownership, keep it simple and ship.\n\nBut the thing that was important was ofcourse ‚Äúscale.‚Äù and the metadata.  \nWell i took a good look at a couple of blogs to come to a conclusion for this one and also there came a need of it.\n\nSo iceberg treats metadata as the system of record. Once you see that, a bunch of features stop feeling advanced and just a reminder most of the points here are for when you will scale.\n\n* Well one thing it has is Pruning without reading data, column stats (min/max/null counts) per file let engines skip almost everything before touching storage.\n*  bad load? this was one i came across.. you‚Äôre just moving a metadata pointer to a clean snapshot.\n* Concurrent safety on object stores wtih optimistic transactions against the metadata, so it‚Äôs all-or-nothing, even with multiple writers.\n* Well nonetheless a lot of other big names do this but just putting it here schema/partition evolution tracked by stable IDs, so renames/reorders don‚Äôt break history.\n\nSo if you arae a startup be simple but be prepared and it's okay to start boring. But the moment you feel pain schema churn, slower queries, more writers, hand-rolled cleanups Iceberg‚Äôs metadata intelligence starts paying for itself.\n\nIf you‚Äôre curious about how the layers fit together (snapshots, manifests, stats, etc.),  \n I wrote up a deeper breakdown in the blog above \n\nDon‚Äôt invent distributed systems problems you don‚Äôt have but don‚Äôt ignore the metadata advantages that are already there when you do.",

The first 8 years of my career was in a consulting company doing a mixture of analytics and data migration activities as part of SaaS implementations (generally ERP/CRM systems). I guess an important thing to note was I genuinely felt like I knew what I was doing and was critical within the implementation projects.\n\n A couple of years ago I switched to a data architecture role at a tech company. Since day 1 I've felt behind my peers who I feel have much stronger skills in data modeling. With my consulting background and lack of formal CS learning, I feel like my knowledge of a traditional development lifecycle are missing and consequently feel like I deliver sub par work, along with other imposter syndrome type effects. Realistically I know the company wanted me for my experience and skills and maybe to be different to existing employees but I can't shake the feeling of unease. \n\nAny suggestions to improve here? Stick it out longer and hope things become clearer (they have over time but it's still hard to keep up), or return to the consulting world where I was more comfortable but now armed with a few more technical skills and less corporate bullshit.",

And for sure, lots of SQL queries. And in the near future, we are going to retire some of the flat files and migrate them to our data warehouse, and we are aiming to improve our current ML model as well. I really enjoy what I'm doing, and have no complaints about the work environment. But I am wondering if I stay here for too long, do I even have the courage to pursue other postions in a more challenging Tech company? Do they even care about what I did at my current job? If you were me, will you aim for jobs with better pay and just settle in the same environment and see if I can get a promotion or find a better role internally?\n\n\\--------------------Edit--------------------\n\nI dm the comments asking about the Bootcamp, I will not post it here as it is not my intention.

What I don't know is if they are common because business analytical requirements dictate it, or if I, as DE, will benefit from it.\n\nAlso, there's the issue of cost. Using Iceberg (what I would use) on S3 to achieve h.s. must increase costs: on what factor? what does the increase depend on?\n\nEdit 1h later: Thanks to all of you for taking the time to reply.\n\nEdit 1h later number 2: \n\n    Conclusions drawn:\n    \n    The a) absence of a clear answer to the question and the presence of b) b.1) references to data modeling, business requirements and other analytical concepts, plus b.2) an unreasonable amount (>0) of avoidable unkind comments to the question, made me c) form this thin layer of new knowledge:\n    \n    There is no reason to think about historical snapshots of data in an environment where it's not required by downstream analytics or business requirements.

        "content": "Hello! \n\nBeen a reader in this sub for quite some time. I have started a part time job where I am tasked to create a dashboard. No specific software is being required by the client, but I have chosen Looker Studio because the client is using Google as their work environment (sheets + drive). I would love to keep the cost low, or in this case totally free for the client but it's kinda hard working with Looker (I say PBI has better features imo). I am new in this so I don't wanna overcharge the client with my services, thankfully they don't demand much or give a very strict deadline.\n\nI have done all my transforms in my own personal work Gmail using Drive + Sheets + Google Apps Script because all of the raw data are just csv files. My dashboard is working and setup as intended, but it's quite hard to do the \"queries\" I need for each visualization -- I just do a single sheet for each \"query\" because star schema and joins does not work for Looker? I feel like I can do this better, but I am stuck.\n\nHere are my current concerns:\n\n1. If the client asks for more, like automation and additional dashboard features, would you have any suggestions as to how I can properly scale my workflow? I have read about GCP's storage and Bigquery, tried the free trial and I setup it wrong as my credits was depleted in a few days?? I think it's quite costly and overkill for a data that is less than 50k rows according to ChatGPT. \n2. Per my title, how can I \"sell\" this project to the client? What I mean is if in case the client wants to end our contract, like if they are completely satisfied with my simple automation, how can I transfer the ownership to them if I am currently using my personal email?\n\n*PS. I am* ***not*** *a Data analyst by profession nor working in Tech. I am just a guy who likes to try stuff and thankfully I got the chance to work on a real project after doing random Youtube ETL and dashboard projects. Python is my main language, so doing the above work using GAS(Javascript via ChatGPT lol) is quite a new experience to me.*",

My proposed plan is to first pull that data, use a library like pandas to do some initial cleaning and organization, and then convert it into compressed Parquet files. We'd then place these files in a staging area and most likely our cloud blob storage but we're flexible and could use Snowflake's internal stage as well.\n\nMy specific question is about what happens to the data size when we copy it from those Parquet files into the actual Snowflake tables. I assume that when Snowflake loads the data, it's stored according to its data type (varchar, number, etc.) and then Snowflake applies its own compression.\n\nSo, would the final size of the data in the Snowflake table end up being more, less, or about the same as the size of the original Parquet file? Let‚Äôs say, if I start with a 1 GB Parquet file, will the data consume more or less than 1 GB of storage inside Snowflake tables?\n\nI'm really just looking for a sanity check to see if my understanding of this entire process is on the right track.\n\nThanks!",

What I‚Äôm losing by normalizing it at this step, except the fact that I have a shitton of tables and I guess it‚Äôs impossible to recreate something if  I don‚Äôt like the normalize logic?

        "content": "I'm at a huge fork in the road in terms of career. I'm going to have to learn something independently but have no idea what path I should take. I've bounced around between different roles frequently, which primes me well for a leadership position but I first have some gaps to fill. \n\nI started as a BI Developer but also did the data warehouse architecture and ETL loading. I designed a data warehouse from the ground up with my manager simply coaching but zero micro managing. \n\nThen I feel like my career took an unexpected turn, I took a job at a smaller firm. It ended up being more system administration with data engineering on the side but definitely more traditional data engineering than I did as a BI dev. I didn't have a manager so the skills I really learned was working with the owners/directly with leadership but it was a small firm and not as formal as I've seen at medium to large companies. No real formal quarterly planning but I was directly responsible for anything that happened or was needed. I really learned to solve whatever problem is thrown at me and I now have the confidence to attack any problem thrown at me. On the technical side I automated their manual workflow, mistakenly using SSIS, because I didn't know better. I later migrated them to the cloud with the support of a very very good consultant. He really liked my ability to learn and solve new problems and I'm still in contact with him today. After migration my job became more of a system administrator but also added new sources to the pipeline. No architecture or modeling responsibilities though. \n\nNext I found a job as an architect based in the cloud. Once again I had no technical people above me. I think this job was a a reach for me, I didn't know what I didn't know and oversold myself. Still I made it work and got my cloud pipelines built but mostly using the interface vs coding the way I expect most companies to work. We used S3, glue, RDS and lambda. This was short lived due to funding for the project and likely because I was over my head. \n\nHer I took a step back and just wanted to be a data engineer at a medium to large company. This was all good until we got offshored. I'm now working through the remaining months of that job while I look for a new one. \n\nUnfortunately it seems the traditional data flow knowledge isn't very wanted anymore and I spent the last 7 years learning more of the administration and leadership side vs technical skills. \n\nAm I simply screwed? Do I have to scramble to learn spark and get AWS engineering certified before I'll be valuable to a company again? I keep getting calls from Linkin recruiters who want me to lead a cloud engineering team but I'm looking for a job as one of those engineers, not their leader. The salary doesn't even seem to be the issue, the issue is no one is looking for general data skills to help train into cloud engineers. I knew u was goin to have to learn throughout my career but I didn't expect this drastic of a shift. I almost fell like front end web developers are in a better position than traditional data people.

They have another team of backend engineers with a dozen employees. This allow the company to have backend engineers taking part of an on call in turns (with a financial compensation). However on my side it's impossible to have such thing in place as it would mean I'd be on call all the time (illegal & not desirable).\n\nThe main pain point is that regularly (2-3 times/month) backend engineers break our data infrastructure on prod with some fix releases they made while on call. I also feel that sometimes they deploy new features as I receive DB schema updates with new tables on the weekend (I don't see many cases where fixing a backend error would imply to create a new table).\n\nSometimes I fix those failures over the weekend on my personal time if I caught the alert notifications but sometimes I just don't check my phone or work laptop. Backend engineers are not responsible for the data infra like me, most of them don't know how it works and they don't have access to it for security reasons.\n\nIn such situation what would be the best solution?\n\nTraining the backend engineers on our data infra and give them access so they fix their mess when it happens ?\nPut myself on call time to time hoping I caught most of the outside working hours errors ?\nInsist to not deploy new features (schema changes) over the weekend ?\n\nFor now I am considering asking for time compensation on case I had to work over the weekend to fix things, but not sure if this is viable on long term, especially as it's not on my contract.\n\nThanks for your insight.",

        "title": "Real-time Data Analytics at Scale: Integrating Apache Flink and Apache Doris with Flink Doris Connector and Flink CDC",
        "author": "ApacheDoris",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "In large-scale data analytics, balancing speed, flexibility, and accuracy is always a challenge. Apache Flink and Apache Doris together provide a strong foundation for real-time analytics pipelines. Flink offers powerful stream processing capabilities, while Doris provides low-latency analytics over large datasets.\n\nThis post outlines the main integration patterns between the two systems, focusing on the **Flink Doris Connector** and **Flink CDC** for end-to-end real-time ETL.\n\n# 1. Overview: Flink + Doris in Real-time Analytics\n\n**Apache Flink** is a distributed stream processing engine widely adopted for ingesting and processing data from various sources such as databases, message queues, and event streams.\n\n**Apache Doris** is an MPP-based real-time analytical database that supports fast, high-concurrency queries. Its architecture includes:\n\n* **FE (Frontend):** request routing, query parsing, metadata, scheduling\n* **BE (Backend):** query execution and data storage\n\nTogether, Flink and Doris form a complete path:  \n**Data Collection ‚Üí Stream Processing ‚Üí Real-time Storage ‚Üí Analytics and Query**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5xktumi95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=58bff724160508aa3b65d27668013b2451af496c\n\n# 2. Flink Doris Connector: Scan, Lookup Join, and Real-time Write\n\nThe **Flink Doris Connector** provides three major functions for building data pipelines.\n\n# (1) Scan (Reading from Doris)\n\nInstead of using a traditional JDBC connector (which can hit throughput limits), the Doris Source in Flink distributes read requests across Doris backend nodes.\n\n* The Flink JobManager requests a query plan from Doris FE.\n* The plan is distributed to TaskManagers, each reading data directly from assigned Tablets in parallel.\n\nThis distributed approach significantly increases data read throughput during synchronization or batch analysis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nm11w5nm95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=7de75abee5e481cc1816edb4f5a794450eaf78e1\n\n# (2) Lookup Join (Real-time Stream + Dimension Table Join)\n\nFlink supports joining streaming data with dimension tables in Doris.\n\n* **Traditional JDBC Lookup** performs synchronous single-record queries, which can easily become a bottleneck under heavy load.\n* **Flink Doris Connector** introduces **asynchronous batch lookups**:\n   * Incoming events are queued and processed in batches.\n   * Each batch is sent as a single `UNION ALL` query to Doris.\n\nThis design improves join throughput and reduces latency in stream‚Äìdimension table lookups.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3xrn78p95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a9b83137da211f91dde0ad32c19c003b8acbe03\n\n(3) Real-time Write (Sink)\n\nFor real-time ingestion, the Connector uses Doris‚Äôs **Stream Load** mechanism.\n\n**Process summary:**\n\n* Sink initiates a long-lived Stream Load request.\n* Data is continuously sent in chunks during Flink checkpoints.\n* After a checkpoint is completed, the transaction is committed and becomes visible in Doris.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w5d7rmut95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c4c308903f6902c398ebd4b0f152fbcb4aac98a\n\nTo ensure **exactly-once semantics**, the connector uses a **two-phase commit**:\n\n1. Pre-commit data during checkpoint (not yet visible)\n2. Commit after checkpoint success\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1nwzo2w95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=174fa327670b871eb62744b05a96fc454ef2d2c1\n\n**Balancing real-time and exactly-once:**  \nBecause commits depend on Flink checkpoints, shorter checkpoint intervals yield lower latency but higher resource use.  \nThe Connector adds a **batch caching mechanism**, temporarily buffering records in memory before committing, which improves throughput while maintaining correctness (idempotent writes under Doris primary key model).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lattav7x95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=26943c7358c98e9dc2dcd0076861d23f80083524\n\n# 3. Flink CDC: Full and Incremental Synchronization\n\n**Flink CDC (Change Data Capture)** supports both initial full synchronization and continuous incremental updates from databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n\n# (1) Common challenges in full sync:\n\n* Detecting and syncing new tables automatically\n* Handling metadata and type mapping\n* Supporting DDL propagation (schema changes)\n* Low-code setup with minimal configuration\n\n# (2) Flink CDC capabilities:\n\n* **Incremental snapshot reading** with parallelism and lock-free scanning\n* **Restartable sync** ‚Äî if interrupted, the task continues from the last offset\n* **Broad source support** (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6564nl0z95vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=93dbfd850c5765db605dd97613c1dc9a3f42e64a\n\n# (3) One-click integration with Doris\n\nWhen combined with the Flink Doris Connector, the system can automatically:\n\n* Create downstream Doris tables if they don‚Äôt exist\n* Route multiple tables to different sinks\n* Manage schema mapping transparently\n\nThis reduces configuration complexity and speeds up deployment for large-scale data migration and sync jobs.\n\n# 4. Schema Evolution with Light Schema Change\n\nDoris recently added a **Light Schema Change** mechanism that enables millisecond-level schema updates (add/drop columns) without interrupting ingestion or queries.\n\nWhen integrated with Flink CDC:\n\n1. The Source captures upstream DDL operations.\n2. The Doris Sink parses and applies them via Light Schema Change.\n\nCompared to traditional methods, schema change latency dropped from over 1 second to a few milliseconds, allowing continuous sync even during frequent schema evolution.\n\n# 5. Example: Full MySQL Database Synchronization\n\nA full sync job can be submitted via the Flink client, defining:\n\n* Flink configurations (parallelism, checkpoint interval)\n* Table filtering via regex\n* Source/Sink connector parameters\n\nThis setup allows syncing entire databases to Doris with minimal configuration effort.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8o0fii32a5vf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0960520b54b0432925a13584963929566966db2b\n\n# 6. Summary\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n* **Flink Doris Connector** supports parallel reading, async lookup joins, and exactly-once real-time writing.\n* **Flink CDC** provides lock-free incremental sync, automatic table creation, and DDL propagation.\n* **Light Schema Change** in Doris enables near-instant schema updates with no downtime.\n\nThe combination of Flink and Doris offers a practical, open-source approach to real-time data integration and analytics at scale.",

Right now every customer gets the same DAGs, but we know at some point there will be divergence based around configuration.\n\n*I was just wondering how best to support similar DAGs, but different configuration based on the customer?*\n\nMy initial idea is to move all the DAGs behind \"factories\", some function that creates and returns the DAG, then a folder for each customer that imports the factory and creates the configured DAG. Then via helm `values.yaml` for airflow update the DAG folder to point to that specific customers folder.\n\n    ./\n    ‚îú‚îÄ airflow/\n    ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ dags/\n    ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ customer_a/\n    ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ customer_a_analytics.py\n    ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ customer_b/\n    ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ customer_b_analytics.py\n    ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ factory/\n    ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ analytics_factory.py\n\nMy thinking is, this keeps the core business logic centralized but configurable per customer.

        "author": "ShipPuzzleheaded2022",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I currently work full time as an operational analyst in the energy industry. This is my first job out of college, and I make around mid 79K(base). I‚Äôm also in grad school for Data Science and AI, and my classes are in person. My job isn‚Äôt very technical right now. It‚Äôs more operational and repetitive, and my manager doesn‚Äôt really let me get involved in data or reporting work. My long term goal is to move into a machine learning engineer or data engineering role.\n\nI recently got an offer from another company in a different industry. The pay is in the low 80s and the role is hybrid with about two to three days in the office. It‚Äôs a bit more technical than what I do now since it focuses on Power BI and reporting, but it‚Äôs still not super advanced or coding heavy. The new job offers more PTO and I‚Äôd have more autonomy to build models and learn skills on my own. The only catch is that raises aren‚Äôt guaranteed or significant.\n\nHere‚Äôs my situation. My current company is fully in person but it‚Äôs less than 10 miles from home and school. The new job is 30 to 40 miles each way, so the commute would be a lot longer even though it‚Äôs hybrid. At the beginning of next year, I‚Äôll be eligible to apply for internal transfers into more data driven departments. However, I‚Äôm not sure how guaranteed that process really is since this is my first job in the industry. If I do move into a different role internally, the pay becomes much more competitive, but again it‚Äôs not something I can fully rely on. I‚Äôm also due for a raise of around 4 percent, a bonus, and about 3K in tuition reimbursement that I‚Äôd lose if I left now.\n\nFinancially, the new offer doesn‚Äôt change much. Maybe a few hundred more a month after taxes, but it offers hybrid flexibility, slightly more technical work, and a bit more freedom.\n\nWould you stay until the beginning of next year to collect the raise and bonus and then try to move internally into a more data focused role? Or would you take the hybrid offer in a new domain for the Power BI experience and flexibility, even though the commute is longer and the pay difference is small?\n\nTL;DR: First job out of college making mid 70K offered a low 80s hybrid role that‚Äôs a little more technical (Power BI and reporting) but in a new industry with longer commute and no guaranteed raises. Current job is closer to home and school, and I‚Äôll get a raise, bonus, and tuition reimbursement if I stay until the beginning of next year plus a chance to transfer internally, though I‚Äôm not sure how guaranteed that is. If I move internally, the pay would be much more competitive, but it‚Äôs still a risk. Long term goal is to move into a machine learning engineer or data engineering role. Not sure if I should stay or take the new role.",

        "author": "TeamFlint",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'd like to share a project I've been working on called **Flint**:\n\nFlint transforms data engineering by shifting from custom code to declarative configuration for complete ETL pipeline workflows. The framework handles all execution details while you focus on what your data should do, not how to implement it. This configuration-driven approach standardizes pipeline patterns across teams, reduces complexity for ETL jobs, improves maintainability, and makes data workflows accessible to users with limited programming experience.\n\nThe processing engine is abstracted away through configuration, making it easy to switch engines or run the same pipeline in different environments. The current version supports Apache Spark, with Polars support in development.\n\nIt is not intended to replace all pipeline programming work but rather make straightforward ETL tasks easier so engineers can focus on more interesting and complex problems.\n\nSee an example configuration at the bottom of the post. Check out the repo, star it if you like it, and let me know if you're interested in contributing.\n[GitHub Link: config-driven-ETL-framework](https://github.com/krijnvanderburg/config-driven-ETL-framework)\n\n## Why I Built It\n\nTraditional ETL development has several pain points:\n- Engineers spend too much time writing boilerplate code for basic ETL tasks, taking away time from more interesting problems\n- Pipeline logic is buried in code, inaccessible to non-developers\n- Inconsistent patterns across teams and projects\n- Difficult to maintain as requirements change\n\n## Key Features\n- **Pure Configuration**: Define sources, transformations, and destinations in JSON or YAML\n- **Multi-Engine Support**: Run the same pipeline on Pandas, Polars, or other engines\n- **100% Test Coverage**: Both unit and e2e tests at 100%\n- **Well-Documented**: Complete class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and design principles\n- **Strongly Typed**: Full type safety throughout the codebase\n- **Comprehensive Alerts**: Email, webhooks, files based on configurable triggers\n- **Event Hooks**: Custom actions at key pipeline stages (onStart, onSuccess, etc.)\n\n## Looking for Contributors!\nThe foundation is solid - 100% test coverage, strong typing, and comprehensive documentation - but I'm looking for contributors to help take this to the next level. Whether you want to add new engines, add tracing and metrics, change CLI to use click library, extend the transformation library to Polars,  I'd love your help!\n\nCheck out the repo, star it if you like it, and let me know if you're interested in contributing.\n\n[GitHub Link: config-driven-ETL-framework](https://github.com/krijnvanderburg/config-driven-ETL-framework)\n\n\n```jsonc\n{\n    \"runtime\": {\n        \"id\": \"customer-orders-pipeline\",\n        \"description\": \"ETL pipeline for processing customer orders data\",\n        \"enabled\": true,\n        \"jobs\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"silver\",\n                \"description\": \"Combine customer and order source data into a single dataset\",\n                \"enabled\": true,\n                \"engine_type\": \"spark\", // Specifies the processing engine to use\n                \"extracts\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"extract-customers\",\n                        \"extract_type\": \"file\", // Read from file system\n                        \"data_format\": \"csv\", // CSV input format\n                        \"location\": \"examples/join_select/customers/\", // Source directory\n                        \"method\": \"batch\", // Process all files at once\n                        \"options\": {\n                            \"delimiter\": \",\", // CSV delimiter character\n                            \"header\": true, // First row contains column names\n                            \"inferSchema\": false // Use provided schema instead of inferring\n                        },\n                        \"schema\": \"examples/join_select/customers_schema.json\" // Path to schema definition\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"transforms\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"transform-join-orders\",\n                        \"upstream_id\": \"extract-customers\", // First input dataset from extract stage\n                        \"options\": {},\n                        \"functions\": [\n                            {\"function_type\": \"join\", \"arguments\": {\"other_upstream_id\": \"extract-orders\", \"on\": [\"customer_id\"], \"how\": \"inner\"}},\n                            {\"function_type\": \"select\", \"arguments\": {\"columns\": [\"name\", \"email\", \"signup_date\", \"order_id\", \"order_date\", \"amount\"]}}\n                        ]\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"loads\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"load-customer-orders\",\n                        \"upstream_id\": \"transform-join-orders\", // Input dataset for this load\n                        \"load_type\": \"file\", // Write to file system\n                        \"data_format\": \"csv\", // Output as CSV\n                        \"location\": \"examples/join_select/output\", // Output directory\n                        \"method\": \"batch\", // Write all data at once\n                        \"mode\": \"overwrite\", // Replace existing files if any\n                        \"options\": {\n                            \"header\": true // Include header row with column names\n                        },\n                        \"schema_export\": \"\" // No schema export\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"hooks\": {\n                    \"onStart\": [], // Actions to execute before pipeline starts\n                    \"onFailure\": [], // Actions to execute if pipeline fails\n                    \"onSuccess\": [],  // Actions to execute if pipeline succeeds\n                    \"onFinally\": [] // Actions to execute after pipeline completes (success or failure)\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```",

        "author": "jbirdart",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi everyone. I graduated in 2023 with a business degree. Took a couple Python/SQL/Stats classes in university so when I started my post-grad internship I decided to focus on analytics. Since then I have about 1 year with Tableau, beginner/passable with Python & SQL. I've done a good job for my level (at least that has been my feedback), but now I'm really worried if I can do my new job correctly. \n\nSix months ago I landed a new role that I think I was a bit underqualified for, though I am trying my best. Very large company, and very disorganized data-wise. My role is a new role made specifically for a small team that handles a niche, high volume, sensitive, complicated process. No other analysts - just one systems admin that is good at Power BI and has a ton of domain knowledge. \n\nI'm not really allowed to interface much with the other data analysts/engineers across the company since my boss thinks they won't like that I exist outside of the data-specific teams and could cause issues, at least until I have some real projects finished. So its been hard to understand what tools I can use or what the company uses. For the first 5 months my boss steered me to Dataverse - so I learned (my pro license was approved right away) and created a solution and when we went to push to prod the IT directors told us that we shouldn't be using that. I have access to one database in SMSS, and have been learning Power BI.\n\n**Here is where I'm really not sure what to do.** I was basically hired to work with data from this one external source that I'm only just now getting access to since it was in development. There are hundreds of millions of lines of data across hundreds of tables - this program is huge and really complicated, and the quality is questionable. I'm only just starting to barely understand how it works, and they hired me because I had some existing industry knowledge. My only option is to do the entire ETL process in Power BI and save the data models in Power BI. They want me to do it all - query the data directly from the source, clean/transform, store somewhere, and create dashboards with useful analytics (they already have some KPIs picked out for me to put together). \n\nThe company currently uses a data lake that does not currently include this source, with no plans to set it up anytime soon. They're apparently exploring using Azure Databricks and have a sandbox setup but I'm struggling to gain access to it. I don't know what other tools they may or may not have - everything I've heard is that there is not much of anything. My boss wants me to only use Power BI, because that is what he is familiar with. \n\nI don't want to use Power BI for the entire ETL process, that's not efficient right? I would much rather use Python, and what I see of Databricks that would be great for it, but my access to that is probably not going to be anytime soon. But I'm not an expert on how any of this works. So I'm hoping to ask you guys - what would you do in my position? I want to develop useful skills and use good tools, and to do things efficiently and correctly, but I'm not sure what I have to work with here. Thank you.",

        "content": "I only lurk on Reddit, but I have to ask. Is it possible to be too dumb to learn C and low level programming? \n\nFor reference, I am in college getting a degree in IT. My degree is generally more networking, infrastructure, and cybersecurity than computer science. The only computer science classes I have to take have been in python, a web development class, and an Intro to Computer Systems class in C. I did well in web development, and I absolutely LOVED the classes in python. C has been a different animal. \n\nI had to work SO hard to barely pass Intro to Computer Systems. The content was kind of interesting, but it was a ton of work. I made it though. I decided that low level just wasn't for me and moved on. \n\nLast year, I got to take a Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation class. It was all in C, but we didn't do any actual development in C. We only reverse engineered C code, then wrote exploits in assembly or hex. I loved this class as well. It was super hard, but I really enjoyed learning about how the exploits worked. The class was geared towards security researchers, which is not what I want to do, but I still loved it. \n\nMy university's computer science program recently started an Operating Systems Development class, based on MIT's xv6 operating system (RISC-V). I decided to give low level development (specifically C) a second chance, but it has not been going well. The content is interesting, but I genuinely feel too stupid to learn it. The lectures feel impossible to follow, and the labs generally take me about twice as long to complete as other students. \n\nI mostly decided to take this class to learn more about a topic I probably wouldn't learn on my own, and I don't need this class to graduate. Regardless, I don't want to drop the class. I feel like I \"can\" do it, but its been so hard. It's kinda making me think that I might just not be smart enough to do low level programming, and that I should stick to the higher level stuff where I do better. \n\nIs it possible to not be smart enough? Or am I just making a big deal out of a skill issue? I enjoy learning about the content, but it takes me so long to get the labs done. Even after I complete them, I usually don't fully understand why my bug fixes work. I try to research them, but get lost in the sauce a little bit. ",

My first problem is that I feel a bit too old to just be starting to get my degree (I am 25yo right now) and feel behind most of my peers. The other thing, and perhaps the most technical one, is that I don't feel adequate.\n\nI try not to compare myself to other since doing so only seems to make feel worse. Thus, I try to compare with my past self.  When doing so, I can see some real improvement (to put an example last year I was not comfortable AT ALL programing 2D arrays during my structured programming course, today I can code some programs using 3D arrays using pointers), nevertheless every now and then I come across a problem that really test me while not being overly complicated and really begin doubting my own abilities (the most recent was writing a program to calculate, using pointers, an Adjugate matrix of an user-input 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 matrix).\n\nI do my best not to rely on AI, I always work my code as far as I can on my own using stackOverflow (or similar) to look things up that I don't remember, and, if I do end up using AI, I make sure to be 100% sure of what each part of the code I used its help for does and how it works in conjunction with the rest of the code, so the next time I need to do something similar, I can do it myself.\n\nI **think** I like programming, it can be frustrating, it can be confusing, but ultimately seeing my work **do** something makes me feel proud, unfortunately that doesn't necessarily translate in getting a decent job to be able to support myself. I hear about projects that other people work on and cant see myself doing such complex tasks. This in conjunction of being in a whole different age bracket that most classmates, makes me doubt if I even have a future in this field (I am calculating, based on my missing courses, to be finishing by the time I am between 27 and 29 yo). Of course, I am already trying to see what I need to get a job while studying.\n\nBasically, I sometimes feel like I am learning, and others feels like I learned nothing at all, and being older as other freshmen/sophomores put me down a little bit\n\nDoes anyone that currently working in the field felt, or feel, like this? How did you get over it? If anyone reading previously had another degree and went back to study CS, I would love to read their experience since that is the boat I am right now.",

But I'm not really sure where is the proper starting point, where to go to learn properly, or what kind of project to even start with if that is even the right course of action. I do thrive on structured, self paced interactive learning, but i always feel like something like codecademy is just making me write code but not even really applying it to anything. Learning theory doesn't really work for me, and while i know codecademy isn't really theory it feels kinda similar, just write random little things and then go make a big thing then forget it all pretty much when you finish and when you go to actually make something the best i can do is print a math equation or text. I'm also in school for Comp Sci and even that feels kinda the same. I really do enjoy this but knowing where to go and learn and sticking to it and having it work for me has been a real struggle. I do see a lot of others who are like me that are thriving and building things and know the syntax like its written on the back of their hands.

I plan to build a full portfolio later, once I learn Angular and can integrate back-end and front-end.\n\n**Bonus question:** From what I wrote above, my insecurity probably shows, but is it worth creating creative projects for a junior developer position, or do companies mostly just want to see that you can use the technologies and figure things out?",

I‚Äôve been working a retail job and just kind of hoping that coding will work out but it feels like I‚Äôm balancing on the edge of a cliff.\n\nI really do like coding though because it gives me an outlet for my creativity and ambition I am just very uncertain what the future looks like and if I‚Äôm actually going to be able to create business from it, and my fear deepens because I feel like I have people counting on me.\n\nSo what do you guys think? What did your journey look like? Do you think it could be the right path?\n\n",

And it's really just a matter of what format and data type \"lens\" you want to view the data as?\n\nHaving the characters 0-9 be their digit counterparts would make it easier to convert from text to numbers (granted, it isn't really that much harder now, because you just have to subtract a fixed offset from the character).\n\nAnother reason I think they didn't take this route is that they wanted the NULL character to be represented by 0, which would slightly ruin the \"0-9 chars as 0-9 digits\" format, but couldn't they still make it work for 1-9?\n\nIt really does just feel kind of non-intuitive to me why they chose to have digit characters not represented by their digits. What am I missing?\n\nAnyway, I'm excited to read your answers, and thanks in advance!",

I can have 2 hours/day for this. I started The Odin Project few years ago and I stopped at the beginning asynchronous Javascript.  \nAnd in what order would you suggest I rebuild my skills?\n\nI‚Äôd really love to hear from people who‚Äôve gone through a similar ‚Äúdesigner-to-dev‚Äù path.\n\nThanks in advance, any roadmap or personal experience would be super helpful!! üôè",

I tend to visualize the spelling of words when spoken to me, so I think it can work. \n\nFor example I imagine the audio would say something like: \nif you want to start a new paragraph, then you would type ‚Äúless than symbol, P, and then greater then symbol‚Äù \n\nSo it would be extremely annoying to learn visually for those of us wanting to learn via typing alongside the teacher.

        "content": "Hi! I‚Äôm working on an algorithms assignment (range maximum on a static array) and I‚Äôm stuck on the exact method/indexing.\n\n**Task (as I understand it)**\n\n* We have an array `a[1..n]`.\n* Build a complete binary tree over `a` where each internal node stores the max of its two children.\n* The tree is stored in an array (1-indexed). `h` is the index of the **first leaf**, so leaves occupy `[h .. 2h-1]`. (Pad with sentinels if `n` isn‚Äôt a power of two.)\n* Implement `maxInInterval(a, left, right)` that returns the **index in `a`** of the maximum element on the inclusive interval `[left, right]`.\n\n**My understanding / attempt**\n\n* Map endpoints to leaves: `i = h + left - 1`, `j = h + right - 1`.\n* While `i <= j`, if `i` is a right child, consider node `i` and move `i++`; if `j` is a left child, consider node `j` and move `j--`; then climb: `i //= 2`, `j //= 2`. Track the best max and its original array index.\n* Expected time: `O(log n)`.\n\n**What I‚Äôm unsure about**\n\n1. Is the ‚Äúsweep inwards + climb‚Äù approach above the correct way to query with leaves at `[h..2h-1]`?\n2. When returning the **index in `a`**, what‚Äôs the standard way to preserve it while climbing? Store `(maxValue, argmaxIndex)` in every node?\n3. Are `[left, right]` both inclusive? (The spec says ‚Äúinterval‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt spell it out.)\n4. Edge cases: `left == right`, `left=1`, `right=n`, and non-power-of-two `n` (padding strategy).\n5. Proof sketch: is there a clean invariant to argue we visit at most `O(log n)` disjoint nodes that exactly cover `[left, right]`?\n\n**Tiny example**\nSuppose `a = [3, 1, 4, 2, 9, 5, 6, 0]`, so `n=8` and we can take `h=8`. Leaves are `t[8..15] = a[1..8]`. For `left=3, right=6` the answer should be index `5` (value `9`).\n\nIf anyone can confirm/correct this approach (or share concise pseudocode that matches the ‚Äúleaves start at `h`‚Äù convention), I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Also happy to hear about cleaner ways to carry the original index up the tree. Thanks!",

        "author": "Ssingleaspringle",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I know that standard C types (long, unsigned long etc.) do not strictly define the size of memory allocated for a variable - the size may differ between platforms. For example x86_64 architecture on Linux uses 8 bytes for variables of type long and 32-bit ARM processors use 4 bytes for the same type (long). The solution for that problem would be to use fixed-width variable types like uint32_t. This part is quite self-explainatory: we can use fixed-width variable types for cross-platform portability. ¬† But I don't quite understand how one should approach numeric literals in C. Let's say I assign a value like this: uint32_t x = 5; Many guides encourage and stress the use of type suffixes stating that I should write uint32_t x = 5LU to ensure the correct type of the assigned literal. LU stands for unsigned long. The part with unsigned kinda makes sense, but declaring a literal's type as long, long long etc. seems to kill the whole point of using uint32_t in the first place. A well-known case where this may cause problems is when performing binary operations on values like this.\n\nprintf(\"%zu, sizeof(1L));\n\nprintf(\"%ld, 1L << 31);\n\nThe result (the same code compiled and run on x86_64 Linux and 32-bit ARM CPU) proves that this is a real problem and the usage of suffixes is not portable across platforms at all.\n\nARM result: 4 -2147483648\n\nLinux result: 8 2147483648\n\nSo my question is: how do you guys approach this problem? I've seen alternatives like using macros UINT32_C(5); or staight up casting (uint32_t) 5; but they also seem to have their own problems. The most common style I see is using suffixes. Programming teams also seem to not care that much (I get it - it's an additional 8 characters per variable declaration üòõ) until it becomes a problem.",

        "content": "Hey there,\n\nI‚Äôm a 2nd-year Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student, and lately, I‚Äôve been kind of stuck trying to figure out when I‚Äôm ‚Äúready‚Äù to actually apply for a SWE or DevOps role. I‚Äôve gone pretty deep into studying on my own ‚Äî I don‚Äôt really take light courses, I usually go straight to the dense books and try to understand things as fully as I can.  So far, I‚Äôve worked through stuff like:   \n\\- C: How to Program.   \n \\- Object-Oriented Software Construction (the Bertrand Meyer one. That took O-O from its core philosophy and engineering principles and some of the Math behind it).   \n\\- Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) and MIT's Introduction into Algorithms lectures.    \n\\- MIT‚Äôs Mathematics for Computer Science (Covering Set Theory, Graph Theory, Proofs, Algorithms, Number Theory, ...), Linear Algebra, Calculus I/II, Differential Equations.   \n \\- Compiler basics (Because I needed to dive into The Automata Theory first and didn't have the time)  \n \\- Operating Systems in more non abstract manner (saw the code of the popular MINIX OS written in C).  \n \\- System Programming (diving into the internals of the operating system and learning and some low level stuff with C interacting with the OS in direct).    \n\\- Database Management Systems.    \n\\- AI with Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach text, and covered some topics like (Searching algorithms to solve a problem, the philosophy and the underlying theory of the early AI stuff)    \n\\- Machine Learning (Hands-On ML Popular Book).   \n\\- On the EE side, I‚Äôve done {circuits, electromagnetism, electronics, Signal and Systems, etc. }.    \n  \nThe problem is, I don‚Äôt really have a mentor or someone to tell me if I‚Äôm focusing on the right things or when it‚Äôs time to just start applying. I‚Äôm aiming to move toward DevOps/SWE eventually, but I don‚Äôt really understand how the market works or what‚Äôs ‚Äúenough‚Äù to start.  If you could give me a bit of direction ‚Äî like what I might be missing, or what you‚Äôd focus on if you were in my shoes ‚Äî it‚Äôd honestly mean a lot.    \n  \nThanks ",

I started work last week, and everything seemed to be going great, I was onboarding smoothly and was getting great vibes all around from the people and the team. In a huge turn of events, on my 2nd day, they suddenly told me they no longer needed me and ended my employment, no negotiations. It was completely unexpected and I am still in shock. I had barely settled in and was still getting used to the new environment. It felt like they were never serious about hiring me from the start considering I could just get let go randomly on my 2nd day, but it's also extremely unfair to me having quit my job at big tech and leaving my friends and family to move across the world to work for them. Has anyone had such an experience before before? Is this a common thing among AI startups right now where hiring-and-firing is just part of the culture?\n\nAnyhow, I am now stuck in San Francisco alone with a 60-day window to find a new job before my visa runs out. If anyone has any advice on how to get through this period, or could refer me to any opportunities in backend, AI, ML, or infrastructure engineering roles in the Bay Area, it would mean everything to me. I have experience as a backend engineer working on large-scale AI/ML infrastructure at big tech, and also full-stack development across smaller companies. I'm open to any types of companies at this point and will put in my best work wherever I end up next.\n\nP.S. Some people are accusing this post of not being real, or sounds fake. It absolutely happened. I understand why doubts are being casted, and I do agree we should not trust everything on the internet, but on the flip side, I do need some room for anonymity as well, considering this post has already been seen by 73k users. All I know is my life has been flipped upside down and I'm looking for advice/help with referrals on getting out of this situation. Any advice/help could be absolutely life-changing for me.",

At this time, the Fed finally decided to reverse their take on inflation being only transitory, and began their first rate hike to begin cooling the economy in an attempt to suppress rising inflation. Corporations responded to this shift in monetary policy and began immediately reducing their hiring and thus job postings. Over the course of the year, SWE job postings fell rapidly.\n\nIn November of 2022, ChatGPT was widely released. Following that, other models by other companies were widely released. The rate of job post reduction did not accelerate following ChatGPTs release. The rate of job post reduction did not accelerate following other model releases. In fact, the declining rate of job postings slowed as the Fed reduce their rate of interest rate hikes. The number of SWE job postings is not materially different now than it was the day that CoPilot and Gemini released.\n\nI am asserting that the CS job market today is almost entirely a product of the normal labor market effects during a Federal Funds Interest Rate hike cycle. The layoffs we see today are still a hold over from the massive hiring effort made post-pandemic compounded by corporations now being squeezed due to comparatively speaking high interest rates.\n\nLargely, not completely, any company that conducts layoffs citing AI are doing so as a PR play as it makes it sound as though they are able to the same work with less overhead and are expertly adopting this new technology, when in reality they are just responding to the squeeze. Any job seeker unable to find a job and citing reasons due to AI are doing so because it protects their ego or they are uninformed about the greater monetary policy and labor market effects at play.",

I've been working at a FAANG for a bit over eight years, and got promoted to Senior around three years ago.\n\nI recently went on a job search, and things went very well for me. I spent several months (April to July) preparing, did a bunch of mock interviews, solved hundreds of LeetCode questions, etc.  \n  \nThat dedicated prep was absolutely vital. While my experience helped me get interviews, the prep work was what allowed me to pass interviews. If I had just started applying without putting the prep work in, I probably would have gotten around the same number of responses, but I would not have been nearly as successful once I got to the interviews themselves. I applied to most of these companies over the last week of July, and ultimately signed a deal with a household name tech company as a Staff Engineer in early October.\n\nI really feel for all the new grads out there - when I was applying, I quickly realized I didn't need to filter the job listings by experience, because basically every company had almost exclusively Senior and above roles - there were barely any new grad or even just early career listings that I could see. It definitely looks like it's a tough market for new engineers, but (in my experience, which isn't saying it'll be true for everyone) the market for Senior and Staff seems relatively robust.\n\nHappy to answer any questions. I also answered some questions about my experience in this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1o38ecf/comment/nitin7d/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1o38ecf/comment/nitin7d/)",

I've actively been trying to recruit some old out-of-work coworkers to this role at a FAANG over the past few months and if they aren't just opposed to part-time RTO their response is almost a universal \"I'd be open to a developer role.\" I don't really understand this philosophy for the people who are acting like AI killed their career or are otherwise frantically job hunting. To me the writing is on the wall: these roles seem to be replacing \"full stack\" developer roles in a lot of companies. The scope of \"full stack\" has changed significantly over the last several years and the way that the hyperscalers and big business alike are operating if your skills don't cross over into cloud/infra management you're simply not going to be able to meet their needs for a high paying role anymore. The only exceptions to that of course seem to be ML engineers or the work that rides even closer to the hardware than the SRE role demands. I've said this many times before, AI isn't killing the CS industry, but it is definitely reshaping it.\n\nEdit: I'm not offering referrals to strangers. Modern AI chat bots can review your resume and offer solid advice on filling knowledge gaps for these roles.",

I ended up on a naughty list for the first time in my career, despite never having performance issues. I explain to my manager and his response is to just ask it meaningless questions. Okay, fine whatever. Then came the \"vibe coding\" initiative. As if we don't have enough inexperience on our teams due to constant layoffs, we're now actively encouraging people to make mistakes and trust AI for the sake of speed. Healthcare company by the way (yikes).\n\nWhat happened to actually knowing things? When will people realize AI is frequently, confidently wrong? I feel like an insane person shouting on every company survey and in every town hall meeting to get these AI-pilled people to understand the damage they are doing. We have people introducing double-digit numbers of defects on single user stories now, and those people don't get in trouble (meanwhile I'm a bad person because I didn't talk to AI last week, for shame!). \n\nI have been applying to dozens of jobs, but every job I apply to is now a game of appeasing an AI reading my application.

Most of the job postings are in developing AI tools that won't be around a year or two from now when they inevitably flop. I'm sure there are companies out there that aren't buying into the AI hype or are just too small to necessitate them, but they seem few and far between.\n\nI'm realizing I have such an appreciation for the critical thinking and problem solving aspects of the career, but as it changes I'm falling out of love with what it is becoming. I feel like I'm on The Truman Show when having to listen to these AI-pilled people. What's your approach to dealing with this? I'd love to hear perspectives from my fellow anti-AI/skeptics.

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I got laid off from my role at a financial services company back in March 2025, right when the market started falling apart. It's been 7 months now of sending out hundreds of applications, and honestly I'm starting to feel pretty lost about what I should even be doing at this point.\n\nI graduated with my CS degree in 2023 and spent about 2 years working as an Application Engineer at a major financial company. My day-to-day was mainly building AWS Lambda functions and Glue jobs in Python to handle data integrations - stuff like pulling Bloomberg PORT data into AWS Athena so fund managers could do risk analysis. I also developed SQL queries and workflows to migrate derivatives and fund data between our internal databases and external platforms like MSCI. I was maintaining and monitoring about 5 enterprise ETL processes that ran daily, handling gigabytes of financial data, and I spent a lot of time on production incident resolution.\n\nMy tech stack was mainly Python, AWS, SQL with PostgreSQL, GitHub Actions, Pandas, NumPy, and some Tableau. So I wasn't doing pure software development - it was more data engineering and integration focused work.\n\nHere's where I'm struggling. I do get some responses to applications - not many, but a few here and there. The problem is when I actually get to the interview stage, I'm struggling badly. I've gotten really rusty after 7 months out of the field, and interviewers dive way deeper into technical concepts than I expect. Things I used to know well - AWS integrations, ETL architecture, even some Python specifics - are getting fuzzy. I can talk about what I did at a high level, but when they start asking detailed technical questions or want me to architect something on the spot, I'm just not sharp anymore. It's like I know I used to understand this stuff, but I can't access it quickly enough in the moment.\n\nOn top of that, I genuinely don't know what jobs I should even be targeting with my background. My title was \"Application Engineer\" but the work was really data engineering and integration heavy. Should I be going for Data Engineer roles? Backend Engineer? DevOps or Platform Engineer positions? Cloud Engineer roles? I honestly don't know anymore, and I think I might be applying to the wrong types of positions entirely, which is why the interviews feel so mismatched when I do get them.\n\nI'm also struggling with how to describe what I actually did. When I write \"data integration\" and \"ETL maintenance\" on my resume, it sounds way less impressive than the work actually was, but I don't know how to articulate the complexity without sounding like I'm overselling it. And the market being brutal right now isn't helping - I know 2025 has been terrible for everyone, but getting through interviews when I'm this rusty is becoming impossible.\n\nI'm at the point where I'm considering a few different paths but I'm not sure which makes sense. Maybe I should take some time to rebuild my skills systematically before continuing to interview, possibly through grad courses or something structured. Maybe I should pivot to a different type of role that's easier to break into right now. Or maybe I just need to figure out how to prep better for these deep technical interviews. Honestly, I don't know anymore.\n\nSo I guess my questions for this community are: Based on the experience I described, what job titles and roles should I actually be targeting? I feel like I'm applying to positions that don't quite match my background and that's showing up in interviews. How do I recover from being this rusty after months out of the field? What's the most efficient way to rebuild technical skills when you've been disconnected for this long, especially the deep technical knowledge that comes up in interviews? Is my experience even marketable in the current climate, or is \"data integration and ETL work\" too niche or not in-demand right now? And for people who've been through extended unemployment periods where your skills got rusty - how did you get sharp again? What actually worked for rebuilding that technical depth?\n\nThe problem is I'm bombing them because I'm not technically sharp anymore. I need tactical guidance on whether I should pause and rebuild skills first, or if there's a way to prep more effectively for these deep technical conversations. Any honest feedback would be really appreciated because I'm genuinely lost here.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I‚Äôm a junior software engineer (9 months in) at a Series B cybersecurity startup with around 60 people.\n\nHonestly, my experience here has been kind of bizarre, and I‚Äôm wondering if this is a normal experience.\n\nI‚Äôm in a small team that reports directly to the CEO: one senior engineer, me, and an intern. The CEO is technically our manager, but he‚Äôs basically a ghost. He gives no technical direction or help. When I ask for guidance, he just says, ‚ÄúAsk other engineers,‚Äù but they‚Äôre in completely different departments and have no idea what I‚Äôm working on. So we all just work in isolation on our own little projects. There‚Äôs no code review, no real communication, and QA is all manual.\n\nThe CEO keeps saying that since we‚Äôre a small team, we have to be ‚Äúextra vigilant‚Äù and document everything ‚Äî but that‚Äôs about the extent of his input. The funny part is, on the rare occasions when he does try to manage us, he becomes super micromanagey, nitpicking tiny details and trying to control everything. It‚Äôs weird because 95% of the time he‚Äôs totally absent, and then suddenly he swings to the complete opposite extreme. Some days I literally have nothing to do because he doesn‚Äôt assign new tasks.\n\nThere are times when I get completely blocked because I don‚Äôt have the resources or information I need. When I mentioned that to the CEO, he told me that I was ‚Äúblaming others‚Äù and that I should be more proactive. There was also this one time during our monthly progress meeting when our senior engineer fell behind on something because she was waiting for an API from another department. The CEO got frustrated and the two started arguing each other for a good minute or so about it.\n\nMy biggest concern is this: Most of the projects I‚Äôve done are small ‚Äî maybe 2,000 to 3,000 lines of code at most. They feel more like college projects than production systems, and I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre even worth putting on my resume. Sure, I have learned a few things here and there ‚Äî Docker/K8s, Nginx with PM2, VM provisioning, shell scripting, a bit of frontend deployment but I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm not getting enough solid experience to grow. I‚Äôve been studying 2‚Äì3 hours every night and 5 hours on weekends just to make sure I don‚Äôt fall behind.\n\nIs this kind of situation normal for early-career engineers at startups?",

Passed their tech interview and I got an offer, but the main hangup is the salary. They will likely not offer me any more than I'm already making. So I'm weighing between my current 2 choices, with their own pros and cons. \n\nCompany A (Current company)\n\n- Currently making $115k. They've been decent about raises so far, so I'd expect to reach 120-125 within a year. \n\n- Java + spring backend, angular frontend. We're a big company, so we have a lot of structure and systems setup. Docker + kubernetes, deployment pipelines, etc. I prefer this stack since it seems like most companies in my area use java + spring. \n\n- I like my current team and manager. No conflicts, we get along well, and my manager is a tech guy so he understands what I do and how to support me. \n\n- Benefits are pretty great, huge 401k match and a lot of PTO. \n\n- The main downside is it's 5 days in office. Yeah, it sucks. It's a 30 min commute so it's not as bad as some others, but it's not great when we used to be 2 days in office before. This is the reason I'm looking elsewhere. \n\nCompany B (Who sent the offer)\n\n- .NET/C# backend, React frontend, and a lot of SQL (we don't use SQL at company A). Mostly Microsoft based tech stack. \n\n- Would probably offer me 115k, but unlikely to see raises afterwards. \n\n- 4 days remote, 1 day in office, and the office is 5 minutes away. This is by far the biggest benefit. \n\n- The team seems good, but they're super small. They're down to 2 devs, the tech lead and another mid level developer. No indication on if they'll hire more. \n\n- They're not a startup, but they're midsized. Not as structured as company A, but also nowhere near the same amount of red tape. \n\n\nWhat would you do in my position?",

        "content": "This summer, I landed an internship at a company I‚Äôd always dreamed about. At the start, everything felt perfect  the team was friendly, people would talk and engage. But as the weeks went by, I started seeing the reality. My mentor never seemed interested in genuinely solving my problems. Whenever I‚Äôd share updates or ask for help, she‚Äôd just avoid it or brush things off with random things. Major issues in my project were ignored by her, even though the entire team, including the manager, knew about these blockers. Because of this, I lost 3‚Äì4 weeks struggling with blockers while no one actually helped.\n\nHonestly, my communication wasn‚Äôt the best since this was my first job. I thought putting in hard work would be enough, but I soon realised it‚Äôs more about networking and ‚Äúbeing seen.‚Äù Even so, I completed my project completely from start to finish, pushing thousands of lines of code in the last five days before my internship ended.\n\nAfter all that effort, I didn‚Äôt get a return offer. The HR gave me random feedback which wasn‚Äôt even related to my actual work. It was clear my mentor and manager had already made up their minds. She never gave me any feedback during the entire internship. Even after it ended, I reached out to her, but she just ignored my message. She‚Äôs only skilled at looking good in front of upper management.\n\nThis whole experience has taken a major mental toll on me. Even now, months after rejection, I feel like a failure. Every time I open LeetCode or even see job openings from that company on LinkedIn, it messes with my mind. Most interns got converted to full-time, even those who barely worked  meanwhile, I did everything right and still got left behind. I‚Äôd be labelled as a failure in front of other interns, the team, and even networks within the company man.\n\nAlthough I did get another offer, working at that company was my dream. That dream was completely destroyed because of these people. Whenever I try to talk about it, people just give me sympathy and say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get better opportunities.‚Äù But they don‚Äôt realise life doesn‚Äôt throw big opportunities every day. It hurts even more because of how things turned out there. Sometimes I wish I had never interned at that place.",

It's valuable experience for sure, but definitely not as competitive as a traditional SWE internship. The jobs she's applying to are here in California around LA and the Bay Area so HCOL and VHCOL so they're going to pay higher than average, but she's actively hearing back from jobs that pay 80k, 90k, some around 110k for ENTRY level roles that require or recommend 1-2 years of experience. Some part-time positions that pay $32/hr which is actually a lot more than my helpdesk job.

Honestly, getting a \"noreply\" is better than having your information sold and being contacted for the hundredth time by some random sales associate (usually speaking broken English with a generic pitch).\n\nThat brings me to the subreddit in question. The first post I came across was this one:  \n[Software Engineer - HTML/CSS/JS @ Apple | $120K‚Äì$210K | Paid Relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/DevJobLeadsOnReddit/comments/1o1dgrx/software_engineer_htmlcssjs_apple_120k210k_paid/)\n\nIt struck me as incredibly generic and out of touch. I left a comment for future readers because the post felt vague ‚Äî basic HTML/CSS/JS skills, sky-high compensation, and no real details on location, employment type, or expectations. Most legitimate job postings include more concrete requirements. When they don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs usually a red flag.\n\nOut of curiosity, I reached out to one of the mods, who also claims to be the creator of the sub. While the conversation was polite, almost every question I asked was either dodged or brushed off. From what I could gather, they're scraping job listings from various sources, rewriting them into more digestible formats, and then notifying the companies afterward.\n\nWhen I asked if they had any process to clean up expired or inactive roles, how the employers are notified, or if they could post the sources for these scraped jobs, the conversation was cut short. Shortly after, I received a permanent ban from the subreddit. That, to me, is a bad sign.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt planning to apply through them anyway. I highly doubt Apple is scanning Reddit for job applicants based on comments and quick pitches. But I do care that people might be getting taken advantage of without realizing it.\n\nThe job market is already stressful enough. The least we can do is call out shady practices when we see them.\n\n**TL;DR:** The subreddit r/DevJobLeadsOnReddit posted a sketchy-looking Apple job with vague requirements and high pay. I asked the mod some basic questions about sourcing and expired listings, got vague answers, and was banned shortly after. Feels like they're scraping jobs and repackaging them with little transparency. Be cautious, this looks more like a traffic funnel than a legit job board adjacent.",

        "content": "Hi. I'm having trouble job seeking as a java developer with 7 years of experience due to the technologies that companies require now. I have experience with java and spring, databases (SQL and non-sql), event systems like rabbitmq/Kafka, rest/graphql, docker, kubernetes, maven/gradle. These are most of the things I do on a day to day basis. Throw in testing (junit, mockito, testcontainers) and observability/tracing tools like kibana/datadog/grafana.\n\nBut when I apply to positions I am asked all of the above and way more. Most jobs are listed as full stack, so they require experience with angular/react. Then they want cloud experience, which is very vague imo. Do they expect you to set up ec2 instances and manage load balancers? They also want DevOps experience, but that doesn't stop at k8s/docker, throw in some helm, terraform, setup clusters from scratch if possible.\n\nAt the end of the day most of these positions seem like 3 or 4 people into 1. They want a backend engineer, a frontend one, a DevOps and sometimes even a tester/IT/infra.\n\nAnd I know those are wishlists but while applying and interviewing, I actually get asked about all these things and even get denied if I don't have experience with them. Is this the new normal? Am I just not versatile enough? The project I work on does not allow me to have experience with all these other things things, and I want to know if you would expect someone to know all of these when working.\n\nAnd to specify: I'm not applying to startups where I understand its more expected to be a one man team.",

Thousands of applications and only a small handful of interviews / calls have gone nowhere so they have amounted to a total waste of time. I'm applying all over the place, for pretty much anything remotely CS related I have most of the experience for so it's not like I only look for remote stuff or $100k+ stuff (in fact I don't even apply to positions that pay that much anymore because I know their standards are too high for me to meet). I have more personal projects that aren't on my resume but they are not really something that I can put on my resume as they don't generate money, aren't complete projects and have no users and aren't particularly impressive in any way, so in effect I am not doing anything at all every day.\n\n[worse resume link](https://imgur.com/a/eUrbC84)\n\nHere's a version of my resume where I removed the non programming stuff, the imperfect GPA, the irrelevant degree, the skills not related to positions on the resume as well as the video game projects as they probably don't count as real projects. To me it just looks even worse in every way and there is zero chance I can get hired with it? Does this mean I am unhireable? It looks like I didn't get anything for the past few years and thus I am a terrible employee that nobody should ever hire. There's also way too much white space because there is nothing more to say about each position that isn't just restating the same things over and over or saying extremely basic stuff (like they don't need to know the exact random libraries I used and it probably would look bad on me for talking about those? I also heard that me talking about something as basic as ajax requests is also bad?)\n\n[more complete resume link](https://imgur.com/a/iaYDKYg)\n\nEven with the more complete resume it still feels very terrible in terms of me competing with other people (I feel like maybe the bar for entry level is having several years of highly relevant non internship experience which I'm never going to get if I don't get a job). Adding in the skills for each position also breaks it when I put it into Workday so I have to get rid of them? It doesn't matter if it looks better to a human recruiter if the system parses it so badly I get trashed immediately so I should remove them?\n\nI just don't know at all what I should be doing to get a job? I haven't been working on \"real\" projects because I don't know how to make those (a project isn't real unless it's generating money and/or has a ton of users?). I know there is a definitive thing I should be doing but I don't know what it is? No amount of \"just do it\" is going to help me find that correct answer, I can't \"just make a game\" like my parents want because that is something that requires years of (non programming) work to make something profitable, and even then companies don't even see video game projects as real projects so all that effort would not help me even slightly?",

        "content": "For context, I attend a T50 school in the US in my locality, in a major East Coast metro area, and am double-majoring in CS and DS. Some roles I've been applying to include the usual Software Engineer / Developer roles of all stacks, Data Scientist, Data Analyst and the few database-specific roles that pop up, and even QA, Business Analyst, and various IT roles (that I'm probably woefully unqualified for anyways since I have 0 IT experience).\n\nLet's say the absolute worst happens, and no company hires me for any role between now and my graduation this coming May. In that case, I'd be forced to either become a NEET (and maybe even officially register for some form of unemployment), or (slightly less undesirably) end up in some retail or service job - something that doesn't require a CS degree - just to have *some* work.\n\n**What's the likelihood I'd end up in this situation? And if I do, what's the likelihood I'd ever be able to escape?**\n\nNow obviously, that's a pretty terrible fate to end up in long-term. So I think I'd need some form of \"game plan\". I've already worked some of these before as a student, and some of my older coworkers there have been \"failed\" students in non-CS STEM fields.\n\nAnd since I wouldn't want to work there forever, I'd likely still be applying to \"real\" jobs on the side, and maybe even landing a few interviews if I'm fortunate, but things might not improve, and could even worsen. This current \"employer's market\" might last for a while (I heard for civil engineering it took nearly an entire decade), and unfortunately, it's possible my skills and degree could risk atrophying in the meantime. And this could kill my motivation to do LeetCode / side projects, etc.\n\nAnd what the hell are you even supposed to tell the hiring team if you do get an interview for a tech position? \"I couldn't find work out of college so I had to work at the local grocery store / restaurant\"? How are you going to convince the hiring managers to consider you over some other cracked junior who has *not* needed to resort to menial labor in order to make ends meet or prevent a career gap?\n\nAt what point should I simply admit defeat? At what point do I seriously consider reskilling into non-tech roles? (I'm already having trouble with even \"adjacent\" roles like DA and BA.) Which non-tech roles, even? I don't think I'd be able to break into law, medicine, nursing, or most trades, and even if I could, I don't think I'd have the requisite interest.\n\nFor the sake of discussion, my definition of \"winning\" would be to have enough money to move out of my parents' house in the suburbs and rent an apartment somewhere major enough for me to have a satisfactory social and romantic life. Doesn't have to be 6 figs, FAANG, or even a SWE role at all. Don't even have to actually do it, just have to *make enough money to do it*, and if the job is really local I could just spend ~1-2 extra years at home and save the earnings to be frugal.\n\nYou cannot do this by stocking shelves or flipping burgers for $15/hour. And if I'm forced to care for ailing parents on that salary while their home - the home I grew up in - goes to rot, then oh boy, things are *not* going to be pretty.",

I didn't use AI for coding at all in college, which seems to be uncommon since it came out a couple months into my freshman year, but I cared too much about learning things for myself and the satisfaction of coding to bother with it much. \n\nWhen I started my job, our lead/senior dev encouraged using AI to speed up processes and handle some tedious tasks. I've been using ChatGPT for writing unit tests, doing more difficult research and bug finding, etc. which are things that I was asked to do to speed things up. I am cool with using it as a tool to augment my programming and I'm sure it does speed things up.\n\n  \nRecently, they've had me install Cursor, which again, I admit is cool and it works, but what the hell is the point of being a software engineer with this? I'm told I still need to know what I am doing, still need to do research into what libraries and patterns to use, review the generated code, etc. but I'm starting feeling like I entered this field too late to actually be a programmer if this is the new expectation.\n\n  \nI don't want to push back on using Cursor, but I want to be writing my own code. I don't want to fall behind in efficiency when the other two engineers are heavily using Cursor, but I don't want to lose the skill of coding and problem solving for myself.\n\n  \nIs there some balance that I can strike, or do I just need to cope with AI taking the joy and satisfaction out of this job?

        "content": "I feel like my job search is going nowhere, about 1000 applications in and nothing has really stuck (only a few calls recently, most recent one was for a place hundreds of miles away paying $45k that still said no)\n\nEvery position out there gets 100s to 1000s of applicants so I have to be top 1% or top 0.1% to get any chance of getting anything. Things are especially bad because all the entry level positions get flooded by people with experience who are obviously better than me in every way? There's also no more spring 2025 positions pretty much, like all those new grad positions don't even have an option to say I've graduated in spring 2025 outside of the \"other\" option which means my application would probably get thrown out instantly.\n\nExperience wise I am in a bad spot, I don't have very much \"real\" internship experience, the past 4 summers in college I was at a small 1 guy + random interns place where I did random hardware ish projects with PLCs. Some years I had projects where I made a mini server and made some pages with PHP and Javascript, another year I made a small app for Zoom meetings on a headset, but none of that really counts as real stuff because I don't have any real metrics for them (because I don't have any relationship with the companies my boss was making stuff for, I can't just ask them to give me months of random data for me to see exactly how much money the thing I did made?).  My parents put my old resume in ChatGPT and got something that just looks so much worse to me? It ended up making those 4 summers into one thing which to me just looks like a complete lie. Background check would immediately see that I only did like 12 months instead of 4 consecutive years or even without a background check they would think I am completely lying because I can't work a full time in person internship in one city and go to college full time in person 100 miles away, that is not believable. Should I just put that lie there anyway???\n\nBut that's all in the past now, I have to do something to make myself more hireable now before my qualifications drop to zero, but I just don't know what. I can't really do networking because there's basically nothing in the way of local software openings. Befriending some random in some company isn't really going to help me unless they are someone really high up, but I just don't have that kind of charisma to make myself the best friend of some hiring person to the point that I will get in instead of all the much higher qualified people out there.\n\nProject wise I am in a bad spot too. Some college classes gave me some stuff to put on there, one class had a group project where our group made a web app with React and Firebase but that doesn't really mean much as it wasn't a \"real\" project with big profit numbers and impressive metrics of any kind. I also spent a year in high school making a old game mod with assembly but that doesn't really count because assembly code is not something anyone is hiring at entry level. It has a playerbase that I estimated to be roughly 5000+ but that doesn't really count for anything because it's not a dollar value.\n\nI just can't think of a good project to do that has anything \"impressive\" or would lead to massively impressive metrics? The only real metrics they care about are dollar values? Because anything other than those aren't really \"impressive\" (it doesn't matter if you've written X lines of code or worked with a database of X size or had X users or used X different programming languages or technologies because they don't really care about that). I don't know how to turn a profit as a guy who isn't an entrepreneur, marketer or good artist. Everything out there bangs on about those stupid metrics and it just frustrates me to no end. Because I don't know how to make anything impressive at all. I can't really think of something that distinguishes \"stupid toy project\" vs \"something hiring people are impressed by\" outside of something profitable or something made specifically for that company (which is just infeasible for me to do, I can't spend months on a massive project just to apply to a single company and have those hiring people not even bother looking).\n\nI also don't really have good answers to all the STAR questions they ask? Because I never have a result that's better than \"it got done\" or something similar. Like I keep repeating in this post I don't have metrics and I don't know how to make a project that makes those metrics happen. I also don't have good answers for their other kind of questions like \"explain a time where you had a conflict with a coworker\" because I don't have experience like that (the worst that happened to the groups I was in was more like \"minor disagreement that gets resolved in 1 minute\", I just don't have a compelling story about how all the group members were arguing for hours and then I stopped it in 1 second.). I also never have a good answer for \"why do you want to work for this company\" because I don't really care about random company #1000 I've applied to, I just can't give them the answer \"I have always strived to work for this specific company and I have never applied to anything else and I will die for this company that I've only heard of when I saw the job posting\"",

        "content": "I'm in the fortunate position to have 2 job offers right now. One of which is full remote (permanently), and the other is in person 4 days a week, with a 1 day WFH policy. The remote gig would be a pretty good salary bump from my current role and has comparable benefits to my current position, which is also remote (but less time off). The in office gig would be significantly better benefits when it comes to PTO, retirement contributions, and while the base salary is the same as the other role, there is an annual discretionary bonus that I have been told averages 35-65% of your base salary (but of course... discretionary) which would make it SIGNIFICANTLY more financially desirable. \n\nI had a really great impression of the culture at both companies in my interviews, however a friend of my mentor warned her that the in office place has toxic tendencies, not from personal experience but via the grapevine from others in the same industry. This really surprised me as I felt like everyone I met was SO friendly and nice and that I would really enjoy working with them, but I don't want to fully discount his take as my mentor trusts him. That said, based on glassdoor reviews I am getting a picture that a certain side of the company is pretty toxic, however the team I'm joining has no overlap with that group. But it's hard to know where the spillover is of course. I have heard good things about the remote company's culture, but my friend who works there has told me he has some issues with upper leadership's direction (but has said he thinks those issues would exist at most companies). \n\nThe remote one is more of a career advancing step into a leadership position, whereas the in office one is somewhere I would get to grow my skills and work closely with mentors to improve technically. I would definitely be locking in in either role to perform well, but with slightly different dynamics. I have about 5 years of experience, so while I think I could tackle the remote leadership opportunity, I don't feel as secure in my skillset as I might want to be in order to perform really well in such a high impact role -- so I think that role would involve a high degree of personal time spent learning off the job to make sure I could keep up. \n\nThe remote role has much more flexible hours so I could continue to step out for an occasional 2pm pilates class if I felt like it, but there is an on call component where I would need to do unpaid overtime occasionally outside of core hours. On the contrary, obviously I'm not doing a workout class in the middle of the day if I take the in office role, but there is no on-call component and the interviewers I spoke with all told me they have never done any overtime and that when they close their laptops at the end of the day, that's really it, which also appeals to me as the remote boundary blurring has been a big issue in my current role as well.\n\nBoth have tech stacks I see as very transferrable skills, although my mentor pointed out the remote one would have much better name recognition when it came time to job hunt next. (Another positive about the in office role is that everyone I spoke with has been there 5+ years, which seemed like a really positive sign about retention). \n\nI am honestly very tempted by the in office role, but multiple friends have told me I'm nuts for not taking the remote role and the phrase \"blinded by money\" has been used. Curious to get some more takes from people who are also working in tech on what's the right move as I do need to come to a decision this weekend. ",

        "author": "LiveMathematician892",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So, I keep getting an excellent feedback about my technical ability, yet, I get shit about my soft skills. The thing is, they won't tell what's the actual problem. All I hear are \"oh, you don't like small talk much\" or \"You're rude and not diplomatic enough\".\n\nHow I would describe myself:\n\n1) I indeed don't like small talk, I know more or less how it works, I just find it annoying and sort of pointless. I know that's how you can create a relationship and such... But I see those guys, at best, 2 times within a year when the team gets of remote, why would anyone care about that? I'm, like all of them, there for the money and thats that... It will read \"machiavelistic\", assholish or something like that but for the last  decade give or take the only relationships I built, or tried to build, was with people where I saw something that I could gain from. It was either people who were smarter than me, people with connections or information that I wanted (although sometimes I think there was misjudgement and I was thinking about getting laid, or at best it was connection of both). This kind of worked and let me get my foot in the door, despite many shortcoming on my end at the time. The issue is, these people are out of the picture, atm way too often I do feel like I'm the smartest person in the room, or, at the very least, knowing the smarter person won't get me anywhere, feel like it's just a matter of a workplace. It ain't Google, Microsoft or anything of the kind, its just some run of the mill company pushing out overengineered, slow, unmaintainable code. Wasnt it for the bad market and my decent pay (Ill have hard time finding a job where Ill get a payrise significant enough to risk a job change in this market. These people won't get me anywhere other than up the ladder in the company, but even so, I rarely get to interact with people other than a lead of my project whos a bit of a pushover. I mean, I don't see any other solution to the issue than reprogamming myself (how???) to attempt building relationships with anyone, not just someone I want to bang or where I feel like there is a clear benefit to gain from them. Only person that I feel like I really somewhat connected at the firm is a tester designated to my project who hates and trashtalks it about as much as I do, that made us have something in common...\n\n2) I'm the kind of guy that leaves a lot of comments under PRs. I get a cred for it, at the very least from upper management. It's not about the extra spaces or formatting, although at extreme cases I'll point that out, I just hate mess or the \"iterative development\" where lack of code review lets very obvious bugs get to the repo, hinder development and generate more work (more PRs). Most people at my company don't do the review, but were getting back to 1) here - most people at my firm are just bad/very average devs (or at the very least lack ambition or are burned out).\n\n3) I tend to be \"judgemental\" or \"rude\". This is coming from me sometimes pointing out someone did a poor job (overengineer a feature, create a poorly worded ticket etc.) without beating around the bush. The thing is, I'm not completely f-ed in the head, I don't do that from day one, the frustation really needs to reach the boiling point where the same thing happens a number of times. But you know what sucks about it, that I give a shit about being \"rude\" or \"judgemental\"? When I tried being nice, giving \"constructive criticism\" at retros, vaguely pointing out things that could be improved... Nothing f happened. You know the routine, theres action point, theres fake action to handle it, then maybe there is a call on what to do, and then somewhat checks the issue as resolved and we move on. Only by expressing my frustation over a longer period, so it was finally escalated to a person that gives a damn, my points that I gave several figureheads finally started to be taken seriously, I made an impact. At the end of the day, the person that matters, sees it as a double edged sword (or something like that) - this dude cares about this project and this company, but hes a douchebag/cant get his point across via diplomatic means.\n\nTLDR: I dont know how to force myself to small talk / building relationships that I find \"pointless\" i.e. without easy to spot value and don't know how to communicate issues/suggest improvements (it feels like at my current firm I need to break the chain of command and go the highest person immediately)",

Everyone at the top of the company in my engineering department has been there for 5, 10, or 20 years (200 people total). I don't usually have to work more than 40 hours and when I do I'm paid for it.\n\n\nThey treat their employees well, but I have a better offer (25% raise) doing more elite work for more money. It's like the engineering equivalent of a FAANG I guess. I can't shake the horrible feeling of guilt when I imagine having to tell my boss that I'm leaving after less than 2 years and that the time they spent answering my questions was a waste. I know the new company puts a lot of investment in their employees like my current one does though.\n\nAlso my wife really wants to be a stay at home mom soon and this gets us closer to that goal.",

It was quite a journey to end up here but this obviously means I don't come from a CS background and have no prior experience in tech. Currently, I'm loving the job, although there's obviously learning curves to overcome each day. I've had positive reviews so far and my responsibilities do continue to grow so I think I'm keeping up with the pace well.\n\nThat being said, the company I work at is a big global company, so the teams are quite specialized. My team in particular is all-things reliability, but I feel like I need to expand my skillsets. I rarely have the chance to work with k8s, docker, terraform, AWS/GCP, istio, and all those stuff in the DevOps & Infra side of things and part of me feels like I should in order to keep more career options open. My question is, can I do that outside of my actual work? In other words is it possible to get (hire-able) working knowledge & skills of these technologies through independent side projects, self-study & certifications supplemented with only SRE work experience (mainly dealing with observability, load testing, launch readiness testing, DR, etc).\n\nOn one hand I know I had these exact concerns when I first pivoted, but I feel like having junior level expectations was very different.
