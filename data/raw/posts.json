        "content": "I've had a 25 year career as a software engineer and architect. Most of my concerns have revolved around the following things:\n\n- Application scalability, availability, and security.\n- Ensuring that what we were building addressed the business needs without getting lost in the weeds.\n- UX concerns like ensuring everything functioned on mobile platforms and legacy web browsers.\n- DevOps stuff: How do we quickly ship code as fast as possible to accelerate product delivery, yet still catch regression defects early and not blow up things?\n\n- Mediating organizational conflicts: Product owner wants us to go faster but infosec wants us to go slower, existing customers are complaining about latency due to legacy code but we're also losing new customers because we're losing ground to competitors due to lack of new features. \n\nI've been vaguely aware of data engineering for years but never really thought about it. If you had asked me, I probably would have said *\"Yeah, those are the guys who keep Power BI fed and running. I'm sure they've probably repurposed DevOps workflows to help with that.\"*\n\nHowever, recently a trap door opened under me as I've been trying to help deliver a different kind of product. I fell into the world of data engineering and am shocked at how foreign it actually is.\n\nData lineage, feature stores, Pandas vs Polars, Dask, genuinely saturating dozens of cores and needing half a TB of RAM (in the app dev world, hardware is rarely a legit constraint and if it is, we easily horizontally scale), having to figure out what kind of GPU we need and where to optimally use that in the pipeline vs just distributing to a bunch of CPUs, etc. Do we use PCA reduction on these SBERT embeddings or not?\n\nEven simple stuff like \"what is a 'feature'?\" took some time to wrap my head around. *\"Dude, it's a column. Why do we need a new word for that?\"*\n\nAnyhow... I never disrespected data people, I just didn't know enough about the discipline to have an opinion at all. However, I definitely have found a lot of respect for the wizards of this black art. I guess if I had to pass along any advice, it would be that I think that most of my software engineering brethren are equally ignorant about data engineering. When they wander into your lane and start stepping on your toes, try not to get too upset.",

We are consistently losing or misprocessing late arriving events from edge devices in poorer connectivity zones. Even with event timestamps and buffer logic in Spark, we end up with duplicated records or gaps in aggregation windows.\n\nAnd two. Schema drift is also messing things up. Whenever the hardware team updates firmware or adds new sensor types, the structure of the incoming data changes slightly which breaks something downstream.We have tried enforcing Avro schemas via Schema Registry but it does not do that well when things evolve quickly.\n\nTo make things even worse, our Snowflake MERGE operations are starting to fizzle under load. Clustered tables help but not enough. \n\nWe are debating whether to continue building around this setup with more Spark jobs and glue code, or switch to something more managed that can handle real-time ingestion and late arrival tolerance. Would like not having to spin up a full lakehouse or manage Flink.\n\nAny thoughts or insights that can help us get out of this mess?\n\nEDIT - Fixed typo.",

The repository has everything you need to run it yourself.\n\nFind the project on GitHub: https://github.com/factorhouse/examples/tree/main/projects/mobile-game-top-k-analytics\n\nAnd if you want an easy way to spin up the necessary infrastructure (Kafka, Flink, etc.) on your local machine, check out our Factor House Local project: https://github.com/factorhouse/factorhouse-local\n\nFeedback, questions, and contributions are very welcome!",

I’m a Junior Data Engineer (\\~3 years in, including internship), and I’ve hit a point where I feel I need to **level up my technical foundation**, but I’m struggling with self-discipline and consistency when learning on my own.\n\n# My background:\n\n* Comfortable with Python (ETLs) and basic SQL (creating tables, selecting stuff, left/inner joins)\n* Daily use of Airflow (just template-based usage, not deep customization)\n* I work with batch pipelines, APIs, Data Lake, and Iceberg tables\n* I’ve *never worked with*: streaming, dbt, CI/CD, production-ready data modeling, advanced orchestration, or real data architecture\n* I’m more of a “copy & adapt” (from other prod projects) engineer than one who builds from scratch — I want to change that\n\n# My problem:\n\nI **don’t struggle with motivation**, but I do with **discipline**.  \nWhen I try to study with MOOCs or read books alone, I drop off quickly. So I’m considering **enrolling in a postgrad certificate or structured course**, even if it’s not the most elite one — just to have *external pressure* and deadlines. I care about building real skill, not networking or titles.\n\n# What I’m looking for:\n\n* A **practical learning path**, preferably with hands-on projects and real tech\n* Structure that helps me stay accountable\n* Deepening my skills in: Airflow (advanced), PySpark/Spark, Kafka, SQL, cloud-based pipelines, testing, CI/CD\n* Willing to invest time and money if it helps me build solid skills\n\n# Questions:\n\n* Has anyone here gone through something similar — what helped you push through the discipline barrier?\n* Any recommendations for **serious technical courses** (e.g. Udemy, DataCamp, Udacity, ProjectPro, Coursera, others)?\n* Are structured certs or postgrad programs worth it for people like me who need external accountability?\n* Would a “nanodegree” (e.g. Udacity) be overkill or the right fit?\n\nAny thoughts are welcome. Honesty is appreciated — I just want to get better and build a real career.\n\nIs it really just \"get your sh\\*t together and create a personal project\". Is it that easy for most of you guys? Do you think it's lack of something on my end?\n\n  \nEDIT: M24",

The pipelines I build are fairly small and nothing too heavy.\n\nI’ve been given a project that’s actually very important for the business, but the standard here is still batch files and task scheduler. That’s how I’ve been told to run things. It works, but only just. The CPU on the VM is starting to brick it, but you know, that will only matter as soon as it breaks..\n\nI use Linux at home and I’m comfortable in the terminal. Not an expert of course but keen to take on a challenge. I want to containerise my work with Docker so I can keep things clean and consistent. It would also let me apply proper practices like versioning and CI/CD.\n\nIf I want to use Docker properly, it really needs to be running on a Linux environment. But I know that asking for anything outside Windows will probably get some pushback, we’re on prem so I doubt they’ll approve a cloud environment. I get the vibe that running code is a bit of mythical concept to the rest of the team, so explaining dockers pros and cons will be a challenge. \n\nSo is it worth trying to make the case for a Linux VM? Or do I just work around the setup I’ve got and carry on with patchy solutions? What’s the general vibe on docker/linux at other companies, it seems pretty mainstream right?\n\nI’m obviously quite new to DE, but I want to do things properly. Open to positive and negative comments, let me know if I’m being a dipshit lol",

You can load data from PDFs, transcripts, spreadsheets, databases, integrations, etc., and pull structured tables directly from it. The output is always a table you can use downstream. You can merge it, filter it, export it, perform calculations on it, whatever.\n\nThe workflow has LLM jobs that are arranged like a waterfall, model-agnostic, and designed around structured output. So you can use one step with 4o-mini, or nano, or opus, etc. You can select any model, run your logic, chain it together, etc. Then you can export results back to Snowflake or just work with it in the GUI to build reports. You can schedule it to scrape the data sources and just run the new data sets. There is a RAG agent as well, I have a vectordb attached.\n\nIn the gui on the left is the table and on the right, there’s a chat interface. Behind the scenes, it analyzes the table you’re looking at, figures out what kinds of Python/SQL operations could apply, and suggests them. You pick one, it builds the code, runs it, and shows you the result. (Still working on getting the python/SQL thing in the GUI, getting close)\n\nWould anyone here use something like this??? The goal is let you publish the workflows to business people so they can use it themselves without dealing with prompts.\n\nAnyhow, I am really interested in what the community thinks about something like this. I'd prefer not to state what the website is etc here, just DM me if you want to play with it. Still rough on the edges.",

It took what I went through, and still going through, for me to post this.**\n\n**So, Chris Garzon..., Lets talk about him a moment. This is a guy who couldn't give a sh!t about his students/clients. Unless, of course, they pay him a crazy amount of money. And, I found recently, he isnt as good as he says he is. There is so much I want to say here but it may incriminate some folks so I must digress. Just know, Chris is not a good person. He has a great face for his commercials and has a good mop of hair. On top of that, he uses some good taglines in his commercials. At first, his commercials targeted noobs like me. He made it seem like this was easy and they were here to help. What a crock of shit.**\n\n**I started learning SQL (which I found out was free). If you have a question about something you are learning, you are asked to place the question in a slack channel that is provided to you. The question sits there until someone gets around to it which is usually the next day. A lot of the time the CSM (Client Success Manager) would tell you to \"check chatgpt\" or \"Look it up on youtube\". What? Isnt that what I paid OVER $10K for? For you to assist me? Sorry to inconvenience your day. Its hard for anyone studying to come across a question or logic that is hard to understand and just need a quick answer.**  \n  \n**Calls for study would happen but the instructor didnt show a few times. They have been better about that. DEA even created a discord channel and right when people were using it, they took it away. At first they were all about \"Study Buddies\". Find yourself a partner and study with them. Great, so you do that and use the discord but then they take it away. Back to square 1. Studying on my own with no one to ask questions or anything. I felt lost.** \n\n**Then, a number of months go by and we see a new add from Chris. He was marketing different. \"You must make between $150k-$200k and have a couple years of experience OR KEEP SCROLLING\" was the new tagline. Everyone was up in arms. Some guy on the site made a post about it. He called Chris out and everything. He was pretty respectful too. I wouldn't have been. To think they scammed the new comers, me. To think that the job security they talked about is now gone and out the window. What pieces of crap!**\n\n**Then... Python starts and the instructor is insufferable. The course is horrible. Not much else to say about that other than I paid over $10k to change my career and become a data engineer and I have to go buy another course because the one I was ripped off for is absolutely terrible.** \n\n  \n**Now, not everything is bad. There have been some good teachers and mindset coaches. Payal was amazing and she got tired of the place and quit.**\n\n  \n**It would be in your best interest to look elsewhere for your education as a data engineer, even if you are experienced. Dont fall for the commercials.**\n\n**#whatdidigetmyselfinto**\n\n  \n**Me...**",

You pay for all tables replicated, even if many are not used now.\n2) Less flexibility: archiving/access to raw data is tied to Redshift; older/unused data still incurs cost.\n3) Possible need to manage Redshift partitioning, retention policies, and performance tuning as more data accumulates.\n\nI am confused what to use. Directly landing into redshift makes things so much more easier and using it as a data lake and then periodically unloading to s3. If I choose s3, can I store the data in s3 tables instead of csv or parquet and what would be the advantage of it?",

        "content": "Hey everyone!\n\nWe just released an open-source Airflow provider that solves a problem we've all faced - getting reliable alerts when DAGs fail or don't run on schedule. Disclaimer: we created the Telomere service that this integrates with.\n\nWith just a couple lines of code, you can monitor both schedule health (\"did the nightly job run?\") and execution health (\"did it finish within 4 hours?\"). The provider automatically configures timeouts based on your DAG settings:\n\n    from telomere_provider.utils import enable_telomere_tracking\n    \n    # Your existing DAG, scheduled to run every 24 hours with a 4 hour timeout...\n    dag = DAG(\"nightly_dag\", ...)\n    \n    # Enable tracking with one line!\n    enable_telomere_tracking(dag)\n\nIt integrates with Telomere which has a free tier that covers 12+ daily DAGs. We built this because Airflow's own alerting can fail if there's an infrastructure issue, and external cron monitors miss when DAGs start but die mid-execution.\n\nCheck out the [blog post](https://modulecollective.com/posts/telomere-airflow-provider/) or go to [https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider](https://github.com/modulecollective/telomere-airflow-provider) to check out the code.\n\nWould love feedback from folks who've struggled with Airflow monitoring!",

The GitHub Actions extension feels clunky and not intuitive.\n\nOur goal is to find a setup that is:\n\nDeveloper-friendly (ideally integrated in VS Code or at least easy to trigger without manual clicking),\n\nNot overly complex (we considered building a Streamlit UI with buttons, but that’s more effort than we can afford right now),\n\nSeamless for deploying Power BI models and reports (models go via Fabric CLI, reports via deployment pipelines).\n\nI know most companies just use Azure DevOps for this — and honestly, it works great. But moving to GitHub was a business decision, so we have to make it work.\n\nHas anyone here implemented something similar using GitHub successfully?\n\nAny tips on tools, IDEs, Git integrations, or CLI-based workflows that made your life easier?\n\nThanks in advance!",

When he was in my place he decided to use Talend with Redshift.  He's quite proud of this, and wants every pipeline to use Talend.\n\nMy fellow engineers have found workarounds that minimize our exposure to it, and are basically using it for orchestration only, so the boss is happy.\n\nWe finally have a new use case, which will be, as far as I can tell, the first streaming pipeline we'll have.  I'm setting up a webhook to API Gateway to S3 and want to use MSK to a processed bucket (i.e. Silver layer), and then send to Redshift. Normally I would just have a Lambda run an insert, but the boss also wants to reduce our reliance on that because ”it's too messy”.  (Also if you have recommendations for better architecture here I'm open to ideas).\n\nOf course the boss asked me to look into Talend to do the whole thing. I'm fine with using it to shift from S3 to Redshift to keep him happy, but would appreciate some examples of why not to use Talend streaming over MSK.\n\nThank you in advance r/dataengineering community!",

        "author": "Adrien0623",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey!\n\nI recently joined a new company as their first data engineer. The team had already set up a basic data warehouse, but I see opportunities to improve its scalability and efficiency.\n\nIn my previous roles, I primarily worked with GCP using BigQuery, Dataproc, and Airflow-managed Spark jobs. I found that stack to be clean, scalable, and cost-effective as a batch oriented pipeline. Now that I’m working in an AWS environment, I’m adapting to a different toolset and architecture.\n\nHere’s a high-level overview of the current setup:\n- Ingestion: Airbyte pulls data from backend databases every few minutes.\n- Storage & Transformation: A provisioned Redshift cluster serves as the warehouse, with DBT jobs triggered by GitHub Actions.\n- Consumption: A back-office app queries both Redshift (when joins accross backend services data are required) and the backend databases (for real-time needs).\n\nWhile this works for now, it lacks scalability and clarity. Key challenges I’ve identified:\n- No data partitioning, due to Airbyte’s current limitations. It's still striking that they don't support it on such important connectors as Redshift or S3...\n- No clear separation between data lake and data mart, making the warehouse feel disorganized.\n- Redshift is over-provisioned and underutilized, resulting in high costs for relatively low value.\n- When backend databases schemas changes (which is frequent), there's often a lot of manual procedure to handle breaking changes.\n\nTo address this, I’m considering the following changes:\n- Replace Redshift with Athena + Glue to cut costs and enable a more flexible, serverless architecture—accepting a bit more latency in return.\n- Eventually replace Airbyte with Spark or Glue-based ingestion, to introduce time partitioning and better control (though some source tables lack timestamp fields, which limits options for now).\n- Move away from GitHub Actions and adopt a more robust scheduler like Airflow.\n- Possibly replace DBT with Spark for greater flexibility in the long term.\n- Add a BI tool connected on the data warehouse to enable self service analysis internally.\n\nGiven the company expects significant data growth, I’d like to design something more scalable, but still pragmatic and cost effective. For now many people agree the current architecture is problematic, that processes are complex and error-prone and that we have little observability and room for improvements. However due to organization structures I have little impact or decision level on data models, migrations etc. And because many people don't have data expertise or experience it's often hard to make them understand some challenges and why some practices are problematic and not future-proof. So I'd be very grateful to get your view on the following questions to be sure I'm heading in the correct direction:\n\n1. Does this current architecture seem suboptimal to you as well?\n2. Do my proposed changes make sense, or would you suggest a different direction?\n3. Any other ideas for improving or simplifying the setup?\n\nThanks a lot!",

        "author": "GrandmasSugar",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey r/dataengineering,\n\n**The problem:** Every team I've worked with needs data validation, but the current tools assume you have Spark infrastructure. We'd literally spin up EMR clusters just to check if a column had nulls. The cost and complexity meant most teams just... didn't validate data until something broke in production.\n\n**What I built:** Term - a data validation library that runs anywhere (laptop, GitHub Actions, EC2) without any JVM or cluster setup. It uses Apache DataFusion under the hood for columnar processing, so you get Spark-like performance on a single machine.\n\n**Key features:**\n\n* All the Deequ validation patterns (completeness, uniqueness, statistical, patterns)\n* 100MB/s single-core throughput\n* Built-in OpenTelemetry for monitoring\n* 5-minute setup: just `cargo add term-guard`\n\n**Current limitations:**\n\n* Rust-only for now (Python/Node.js bindings coming)\n* Single-node processing (though this covers 95% of our use cases)\n* No streaming support yet\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/withterm/term](https://github.com/withterm/term)  \nShow HN discussion: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44735703](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44735703)\n\n**Questions for this community:**\n\n1. What data validation do you actually do today? Are you using Deequ/Great Expectations, custom scripts, or just hoping for the best?\n2. What validation rules do you need that current tools don't handle well?\n3. For those using dbt - would you want something like this integrated with dbt tests?\n4. Is single-node processing a dealbreaker, or do most of your datasets fit on one machine anyway?\n\nHappy to answer any technical questions about the implementation. Also very open to feedback on what would make this actually useful for your pipelines!",

I was frustrated with a lot of existing metadata tools, specifically as a tool to provide to individual contributors, they were either too complicated (both to use and deploy) or didn't support the data sources I needed.\n\nI designed Marmot with the following in mind:\n\n* **Simplicity**: Easy to use UI, single binary deployment\n* **Performance**: Fast search and efficient processing\n* **Extensibility**: Document almost anything with the flexible API\n\nEven though it's early stages for the project, it has quite a few features and a growing plugin ecosystem!\n\n* Built-in query language to find assets, e.g `@metadata.owner: \"product\"` will return all assets owned and tagged by the product team\n* Support for both Pull and Push architectures. Assets can be populated using the CLI, API or Terraform\n* Interactive lineage graphs\n\nIf you want to check it out, I have a really easy quick start that with docker-compose which will pre-populate with some test assets:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/marmotdata/marmot \n    cd marmot/examples/quickstart  \n    docker compose up\n    \n    # once started, you can access the Marmot UI on localhost:8080!

I currently have a dictionary object that I just set some first level data in. I save this dictionary object several times as a file up in a bucket. This tracks information about the process such as\n\n\n\na. did i log into the API successfully\n\nb. how much data is available\n\nc. how much data did i download successfully\n\nd. did the api report any license changes when queried.\n\n\n\nThis is all separate from the API data that I download and save. I want to save the process information as it helps me troubleshoot and manage what happened. \n\nI then process the process information json file after the fact to see what happened. The read/report process runs in a different code base so the idea of having json is nice since i dont have to care about the json being a certain structure. I output some text to a chat bot to a small group of users. I would like to send some more information in the read/report process via email; or even save to a database and stand up a simple self hosted streamlit process. However, when I report it's a straight one-shot read the json files saved, do some simple calcs in pandas and output to a chat room.  I dont save the metrics in another datasource.\n\n\n\nHowever i would like to send a lot more information in the json file as the process runs.  And I want to report on it. Each process has several disparate steps that it goes through. \n\nI am thinking that I should convert the json file to a pub sub event process that publishes to a database. I have GCP so i can use pub sub, I also have access to a simple postgresdb to publish to. \n\n\n\nI do like that my stack is simple (json file to bucket) but i also know that I am not getting information that I want.\n\nThoughts on how I could improve on this? I dont mind adding something to the stack to support it. Adding something like Sentry would be my last choice at the moment as I am trying to keep the reporting stack closer in house. I am mostly looking for nice incremental improvements I can make that aren't re-stacking everything.\n\n\n\nA few other notes\n\n\n\n\\- These are cronjobs running in a linux box\n\n\\- No airflow, airbyte, dagster in the stack at the moment\n\n\n\n\n\n",

One option could be to use RDS Proxy or PgBouncer.

        "content": "Hey folks,\n\nI've been working on [`rustframe`](https://github.com/Magnus167/rustframe), a small educational crate that provides straightforward implementations of common dataframe, matrix, mathematical, and statistical operations. The goal is to offer a clean, approachable API with high test coverage - ideal for quick numeric experiments or learning, rather than competing with heavyweights like `polars` or `ndarray`.\n\nThe README includes quick-start examples for basic utilities, and there's a growing collection of demos showcasing broader functionality - including some simple ML models. Each module includes unit tests that double as usage examples, and the documentation is enriched with inline code and doctests.\n\nRight now, I'm focusing on expanding the DataFrame and CSV functionality. I'd love to hear ideas or suggestions for other features you'd find useful - especially if they fit the project's educational focus.\n\n### What's inside:\n\n* **Matrix operations**: element-wise arithmetic, boolean logic, transposition, etc.\n* **DataFrames**: column-major structures with labeled columns and typed row indices\n* **Compute module**: stats, analysis, and ML models (correlation, regression, PCA, K-means, etc.)\n* **Random utilities**: both pseudo-random and cryptographically secure generators\n* **In progress**: heterogeneous DataFrames and CSV parsing\n\n### Known limitations:\n\n* Not memory-efficient (yet)\n* Feature set is evolving\n\n### Links:\n\n* GitHub: [Magnus167/rustframe](https://github.com/Magnus167/rustframe) (includes CI/CD and self-hosted runners)\n* Crates.io: [rustframe](https://crates.io/crates/rustframe)\n* Homepage & Examples: [magnus167.github.io/rustframe](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/)\n* Docs:\n  [magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/docs/)\n  or\n  [docs.rs/rustframe](https://docs.rs/rustframe/latest/rustframe/)\n* [Benchmark report](https://magnus167.github.io/rustframe/benchmark-report/)\n* [CodeCov report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/Magnus167/rustframe/)\n\nI'd love any feedback, code review, or contributions!\n\nThanks! \n",

Just validation in your browser.\n\n\n\n# Why it matters:\n\nI designed the UI and contract format to be **clear and readable by anyone** — not just engineers. That means someone from your team (even the “Excel-as-a-database” crowd) can write a valid contract in a single video call, while your data engineers focus on more important work than hunting schema bugs.\n\nThis lets you:\n\n* Move validation responsibilities earlier in the process\n* Collaborate with non-tech teammates\n* Keep pipelines clean and predictable\n\n# Tech bits:\n\n* Python lib: data-sitter (Pydantic-based)\n* TypeScript lib: WASM runtime\n* Contracts are compatible with JSON Schema\n* Open source: [GitHub](https://github.com/lcandea/data-sitter)\n\n# Coming soon:\n\n* Auto-generate contracts from real files (infer types, rules, descriptions)\n* Export to Zod, AVRO, JSON Schema\n* Cloud API for validation as a service\n* “Validation buffer” system for real-time integrations with external data providers\n\n",

I wasn’t expecting big changes because they were busy with coursework and exam prep and didn’t have much time to practice between sessions. To my surprise there was a huge difference in the way they solved questions.\n\nThis experience completely changed my perspective on learning programming. For many topics like system design or learning a new language, a week of focused effort can cover most essentials. I used to think problem-solving was different that you had to grind endlessly to “figure it out.” In college, I spent countless hours on Codeforces (eventually reaching ~1900 rating and I remember feeling soo excited) and told others, including my brother to just practice more. Looking back, I wish I had given better advice not just solely focusing on practicing a lot of questions but thinking and improving the approach we take for solving any problem",

I am looking for gift ideas that will encourage and tap into that \"coding desire\" but aren't necessarily \"learning to code\" yet.  These can be games, books or anything of the sort, maybe even android apps but it would be nicer if it was something physical.  So far the only thing i've really thought of is redstone books / guides so he can do some minecraft logic.  However, I would prefer something more physical. These don't need to be directly coding related but anything that will stimulate that tinkerer, programmer, problem solving mind.  Bonus if it is coding related but I'd settle for something that scratches the programming itch. \n\nI know of scratch, but as he doesn't have a computer, I think ill save that one for a little later when he does.\n\n\nedit: Whoa, this blew up fast. Thanks everyone for your answers, there are some great suggestions.. including just getting him a computer (which I agree - but I have to convince his mum on that one first!).  I am going to go through everything suggested and see if there's some we can do together and some for him to do on his own.

I find a project with source code (usually from GitHub or a course).\n2. I go through the code and figure out which parts I don’t understand.\n3. I take crash courses or quick tutorials on those missing concepts.\n4. Then I try to rebuild the project from scratch on my own.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of people here say that building your own stuff is the key, and I totally get that. But as a beginner, building something *completely* on my own still feels a bit overwhelming. So this method has been kind of a middle ground for me. I’m currently thinking to work on 3–4 projects using this approach.\n\nJust wondering — does this sound like a good learning path?

My last couple of review cycles have been positive overall but have highlighted some areas that I feel like are quite big weaknesses for me and that I am not sure how to improve at.\n\nIt took me a very long time to get to the level of being a steady junior contributor who can be given a task and reasonably trusted to implement it with some guidance and instruction from more senior engineers (partially slow adjustment period on my part, partially poor management during COVID) but I really feel like I've hit a plateau and don't know how to get out of it. \n\nThe main feedback I'm getting is that I need to do more code reviews and speak up more in meetings to discuss design - my work is fine in and of itself (though I feel my ability to design things and push my projects forward is a bit lacking) but I have very little impact on the wider team. \n\nI feel like I don't know how to analyse code or review it at all, that I have no deep understanding or knowledge. I can execute tasks well but really struggle a lot with designing solutions to problems or critiquing designs to suggest improvements or point out potential holes. When I try to review code I can spot simple mistakes, but amn't able to give anything more indepth (pointing out areas of refactoring, inefficiencies, suggesting alternative ways of solving the problem) and don't know where to start. When I start looking at reviews I can just feel my mind go blank instead of being able to break down the review and think through what's going on with it or what could be done better.\n\nBecause I've been working in this career for quite some time I feel bad even asking for help, I've managed to struggle my way through it so far but it's very stressful and I don't want to feel so incompetent and afraid when doing my job. It feels like I should be able to do this already.",

I only know HTML, CSS and JS, but I understand the basics of react and node because I've coded a book store project along a youtube tutorial. My resume is almost empty.\n\nI know it's completely my fault, but I think I have executive dysfunction. Now that the time has started running out, the stress of graduating without atleast an internship is pushing me to take action.\n\nSo I just wanna ask, how do I actually begin making good projects and make sure I'm learning and not just relying on tutorials and AI. I keep seeing students' resumes on here, their projects have terminologies that sound so complicated. Apart from that they even have experience and still struggling to land roles. And here I am just starting, but don't want to waste more time. And I kinda need to do it fast, to try and gain some internship experience.\n\nI think I believed in my abilities a few years ago, but lately I just don't. Been feeling defeated and full of regret. Please offer some advice, which will help me take concrete, focused action.\n\nThanks for reading.",

However, I’m unsure what the job landscape looks like for this path:\n\t•\tWhat kinds of jobs typically involve low-level programming (outside of the usual embedded/firmware developer roles)?\n\t•\tAre there realistic remote opportunities in this field? Or is most of the work tied to physical labs/offices due to hardware access?\n\t•\tAny tips on what kinds of projects or skills I should build to get my foot in the door?\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice, stories, or resources from people already working in this space.

I want to “action” it. \n\nI’ve watched a ton of YouTube videos and can run regression analysis and do basic strings/variables that provide info within PyCharm. But if I wanted to program a simple rock, paper, scissors game into a website, then what do I do with the code? Is this where mobile application software and website design software come in? Do I paste this code into this type of software to actually “create the game”? And not just have it spit out random variables (Rock, paper, or scissors) in PyCharm? \n\nMy current knowledge (which is probably wrong) is that:\n1. You download a programming language\n2. You write the code\n3. You run it within a developer environment (PyCharm for example)\n4. Once tested in PyCharm — you run that code in another software that will “bring it to life”\n\nStep 4 has me co dosed as hell.

        "content": "I tried to learn CS both out of an interest to learn about applied mathematics field and to understand the theory behind software development. \n\nI had taken an intermediate java course and while I often asked for help, I thought I was prepared for the next semester of: linear algebra, intro to discrete math, intro to dsa. I failed all of these classes simultaneously despite my efforts.\n\nIn linear algebra I think I failed because I could not rely on recognizing patterns within the syntax and formatting of the problem, and even when I tried to review axioms and patterns from lecture I still wasn't prepared for the vast variety of scenario problems, especially if I had to try and recognize which parts of the problem were which fact or formula due to the problem being a real world scenario example where the properties are not labelled. When I would try to ask other students how they were comprehending the material they mainly gave general study tips such as going through textbook problems and watching 3blue1brown. When I would do textbook problems because the homework was assigned by the university question bank  based on 'real world/puzzle scenarios' and not the professor.  I never felt prepared even after going through several textbook problems,  but that was not an excuse- I just wasn't sure what I needed to know to be able to answer \\*any\\* linear algebra question. I would try rewriting facts on paper over and over, I would try asking myself conceptual questions and going through the lecture until I could answer my own problems, which was not manageable because I would run out of time for my homework I was struggling to do no matter how many textbook problems I tried in preparation.\n\n  \nIn discrete math I failed I believe because I was too pre-occupied in surviving linear algebra and intro to dsa that I also was unprepared for the puzzle format of the class because linear algebra was already a puzzle to me.\n\n  \nIn intro to dsa I failed because I lacked programming experience to implement the algorithms and data structures we were learning from scratch as per instruction, and the teacher even told me that my programming skills were too remedial. I also wasn't making any projects outside of class to catch up because I was butting heads with linear algebra.\n\nI ended up feeling I spent too much time just trying to survive my math classes, and I failed anyways.\n\nI have tried just focusing on programming since I had to drop out of CS irregardless due to not being able to afford more than 2 more years of college at most and everything going all over the place in my family finances and working full time during school.  I was barely a freshman in terms of core class credits going into junior year,  but  I don't want to give up and still want to technically finish a CS  degree curriculum  on my own even if my degree is no longer CS.\n\nWhen I am given advice on how to learn programming, the advice is to find a field of interest and start making projects from scratch, but I'm not sure how to make projects from scratch if both my programming  and computer science skills are novice. I then watch a tutorial 'for complete beginners' in a field such as gamedev or android app development, I learn about methods and variables from programming frameworks such as godot or kotlin, but I still don't really understand the design of the library and how everything works. \n\nwhen I am having trouble making a project from scratch I am told to start very simple, but even things such as \"how to draw a 2d triangle program\"  opens up a new journey  learning the  opengl library which I don't have the cs/programming skills to properly parse the documentation, or watching a tutorial, trying to search up the code I see in the documentation, and still not understanding.\n\n\n\nI have still tried to review intro to dsa and discrete math, but I don't feel any more prepared programming wise when going through topics such as cardinality of sets or linked lists. To understand these concepts more I am told to try implementing them from scratch..but I don't know how. \n\nI then go back to an \"intro to java/python/c# course\" for the nth time, go over arrays, variable types, string, int, if else statements, loops, nested loops, pointers, but still don't feel I know how to design a program and implement it in code. I still don't feel I understand the native library in those languages. I don't understand how a computer is able to encode the concept of inequality such as 2 <3 or why I need a current and temp variable when traversing an array or swapping array values.\n\n\n\nI'm not quite sure how to move forward. \n\n  \n",

I don't have a job in programming, only have 1 major project under my belt, and I still have a lot to learn.\n\nNow for my advice that I wished I knew when I started out: code by discipline, not by inspiration.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? Well, you know how some of you guys (typically beginners) will wait until you get a cool idea of what to code like a poker game or a new mod for minecraft, code it, then wait for your next big idea to come to you? Yeah stop doing that. Waiting on motivation to code won't build good habits and at the end of the day you can't make it that far, not just in getting a job but in your personal growth as well. Coding by discpline means to code something, anything every day or whatever interval you want to set. If you don't have an idea, search for one online. Maybe even do some leetcode problems if nothing interests you that day. But, you have to do something. After all, if you want to get a job in coding you will have to code every day. Might as well get used to it early right? But yeah, just waiting until ispiration strikes means you won't code as many projects as you could've if you just coded say a small add function to a calculator, or the collision physics for snake instead of doing nothing.\n\nAnyways, that's my advice. What do you guys think of it? I hope this helps someone out starting coding!",

Eventually, I turned it into a short book.\n\nA few ideas it covers:\n\n* How to evolve a system without turning it into spaghetti\n* Safer ways to deserialize and construct your data\n* Turning input validation into something the compiler helps with\n* Where generics shine — and where they secretly hurt you\n* Treating time/space complexity as part of the interface contract\n* Making failure obvious and early instead of quiet and delayed\n\nIt’s all freely available — just a public repo on GitHub.\n\nIf that sounds interesting, I’d be genuinely happy to hear what you think.",

I got into an internship (called FTT) where I was placed in a project as a backend developer — but there wasn’t much onboarding or guidance.\n\nThe project is a WhatsApp chatbot (not AI-based, just a menu tree of questions and answers to help students with common doubts about our university). The second part is a dashboard for professors to interact with “tickets” — messages from students that the bot couldn’t handle.\n\nAt first, I was excited and learned a lot. I got exposed to things like databases, HTTP requests, backend frameworks, APIs… way more than I ever saw in class. But now I’m stuck. I don’t know what the next step is. I’m just staring at the codebase and feeling completely lost.\n\nTo make things worse, the “client” (university professors) barely show up to clarify things. We don’t know what API to use for WhatsApp integration, and we’re not even sure if we’ll get access to a real number to test the bot properly.\n\nWe had about a month of vacation, and during that time, I started learning Java. It felt cool — I like how structured it is. But despite that, I still feel like I don’t know how to code. I feel like I’m just copying code, Googling everything, and faking my way through things. I don’t feel like a “real” dev. Sometimes I feel like a fraud.\n\nI know this is all part of learning, but it’s hard not to feel lost or like I’m falling behind.\n\nHas anyone else been through something like this? Any advice on how to push through this kind of block?",

This is a pattern whereby managers, after initialization, are registered into a centralized registry as pointers to themselves. If another manager needs access to a resource, just request a pointer to the manager that owns it through the service locator.\n\nHere's my question: In especially large-scale projects that involve A LOT of communication between its managers, are multithreaded, and especially do unit testing, what is the better approach: dependency injection or service location?

One of the main reasons is that my salary hasn't kept pace with industry standards, which has made me feel undervalued in my role.\n\nOver time, I've learned a lot through trial and error, but I've also tried to use my own knowledge and experience to improve my skills. Unfortunately, as one of the remote workers in the company, they are mobbing me to leave. As a result, my team pushing me to do tasks like meetings, ci/cd deployments and documentation. Limiting my work but I still do the coding stuff because Im the one who is pushing for it and I dont get any support from my team. It started be like this since last 2 years. First 2 years were great and I learned a lot in those times.\n\nI've found it tough to balance my work and personal life because of work times and getting tired from sitting for 8-10 hours. These has made it hard for me to find time to learn new things outside of work. \n\nI have applied for jobs but I've often struggled with basic development trivia questions because I haven't been keeping up as much as I'd like or memorizing about everything about the technology I used.\n\nIn one of the applications that did showcase my skills was the one I created a microservice from stratch. But after the project interview they wanted me to write some basic code(reverse the string they provided). It took me a bit longer than expected to get it done because I wasnt going to write code in the interview from what they told, my laptop was in a way to show my face which didnt had room for me to write but I managed to write it with some debugging. It wasnt enough for them I think they just declined my application. I applied to here through a senior friend and they thought how did he create all of this by himself, must have got helped which I didnt get any.\n\nAnyway, now I'm feeling a bit stuck and unsure about how to move forward. Despite knowing a lot about project structures and API design, backend development etc... I'm not feeling like my skills are growing as quickly as I'd like. \n\nIm doing some leetcode, hackerrank examples and studying some topics (taking notes) but yet Its not enough or match the criteria for the applications. Sometimes I feel like I cant write code without looking to documentation or examples. And sometimes I cant write it out of my head, I know what to create or write as an idea but the functions or annotations are not in my memory all the time, I have to look for the usage.\n\nI'm wondering how can I make some changes or seek out new opportunities to learn and grow. Im really tired of this loop, feeling like exhausted but need a job for living. I keep learning, taking notes etc but Im still here without moving forward",

Every time.  \n  \nAnother example is coding in different languages. If I spend some time with one language or framework, it inevitably leads to forgetting stuff from other languages, and when I switch them, I usually spend more time recalling the stuff I forgot than advancing. It feels like an uphill battle all the time.   \n  \nI'm sure some people manage to overcome these struggles, and so I'm asking - how do you juggle multiple projects, stacks effectively, without losing step at any of them? Maybe it's a silly question, but I'm genuinely curious how other people stay productive in these situations.",

To prevent files from touching my server I plan to use pre-signed URLs with some restrictions on file type, size, etc. but I still have some concerns that I am hoping someone could clarify.\n\nI need a way to remove metadata from the images and (I think?) scan them for malware. My approach is to just do this with Lambda and use either a temporary uploads bucket, then run the scans and move to a separate permanent storage bucket, or just upload directly to permanent storage. The part that I am concerned about is that this does not seem to be the industry standard. I have played around with several sites and they all seem to have the same approach. They use a single bucket, and the entire image upload latency is < 5 seconds. After \\~5 seconds the images are uploaded and available via their CDN, the metadata is removed, and I assume they have either already scanned for malware or have queued an async scan.\n\nUnless there is something I am missing, it seems that there is a brief period of time where user content is available via their CDNs but post-upload processing like metadata removal and malware scans have not been completed. Is the the standard approach to just immediately serve images and accept the low levels of risk as a tradeoff for very fast UIs, or is there a better approach that I am unaware of?",

Because I realized I suck at coding so much and I’m struggling to improve.\n\nAt first, I thought it was time investment ; I thought I simply wasn’t coding enough.  Then I thought I just didnt know the syntax. Now, I’ve realized that u will most likely never know all the built in functions or the syntax, but u still should be able to code and solve problems. \n\nMy biggest issue is this: I dont think I ever approached compsci in a correct way. I just thought if I solve enough questions, if I just see enough codes from the past, I’d be able to get past it like I did with other subjects in high school but it’s not true. The more I try to become better, the more I realize the biggest issue is: I really don’t know how to break down big problems into smaller ones, know how to specify what kind of functions/ datatypes I will use, and solve the problem. I’ve just been learning the syntax, never deeply dove down to the core of the problem, and relying on ai when there are parts I dont know how to fix.\n\n And to make things worse, I really dont know how to practice these things. The more I look at what I’m doing, I’m realizing more that I have really shaky foundations in computer science, and I’m scared because I know in a couple weeks, I’d just have assignments and exams flooding, possibly without fixing the core issues I need to fix. I really dont want to continue ‘barely passing’ all my subjects over and over and end up graduating as a C/D tier software engineer who can easily be replaced. I would really appreciate help. Books, any type of online practice for this kind of thinking. I’m often overwhelmed even by leetcode style questions where there are multiple things i need to do for one program, and it’s like I start panicking completely and I dont know what to do or how to even approach the problem. When things get complicated, I simply don’t know where to begin with.\n\nI seriously feel so useless because I just recently found out I was focusing on the wrong thing the past two years. I can’t afford to give up now either. I NEED TO MAKE THIS WORK. \nPlease help me 🙏",

However, we have never written unit tests for the Java code. Was thinking to write unit tests on the Java methods that help support the Gherkin Syntax to catch any issues with our Gherkin integration tests, such as false positives, , ensure the syntax is working as intended, etc., but is that a good practice?\n\nMaybe I am overthinking it. I guess we can write unit tests for anything if we want to, but also not sure if we are writing tests for tests in this case, which I think might be a bad practice. It's more of tests for the Java code that allows QA to write the integration tests. I have only seen unit tests for a service's or library's functionality, but not for the tests in a way so was having some doubts.",

        "author": "FredWeitendorf",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "A lot of standard advice for applicants are obsolete or actively harmful now. I guess this is my attempt at a PSA, to try to explain things from the other side of the table, because it really pains me to see young candidates I might have otherwise hired follow actively harmful advice.\n\n(Some background: I run the full recruiting process for my startup without any recruiters, and since my company is small, I'm also the hiring manager for everybody I interview, and fill all the typical HR roles too. We don't have any interview quotas, ATS filters, etc)\n\nLet me start with what I think about when hiring, because I think candidates may \"know\" these are important but don't fully recognize how it impacts everything else. I'm gonna put some stuff in **bold** for the skimmers.\n\nNumber one most important thing: **Can I trust this person?** Are we going to be happy working with each other?\n\nNumber two most important thing: **How well will they be able to do the job?** Note that this is not whether they *can* do the job now.\n\nThird most important thing: **Do they genuinely want to work here, will they be happy here, and do they \"get it\"? Or, are they just saying/doing whatever they think will maximize their chance of a job offer?** Obviously, they wouldn't be here if not for the money. But if they bring a bad attitude to work, or dislike their job, they literally make it worse for everyone else at the workplace.\n\nNone of that should be surprising. But where things break down is when candidates start thinking about interviewing as an adversarial problem of hyper-optimization and beating the system, **they might improve something small at the expense of completely disqualifying themselves on the really important stuff like trustworthiness or perceived competence.** And I think most don't realize it.\n\nHere are a few common examples:\n\n* Sending very flowery, \"fake personalized\", **clearly-chatgpt-written emails and messages** when I reach out to set up times or talk about the role; ditto with followups and DMs. -> I lose trust and think the candidate has poor communication skills, because they don't understand why this is bad and noticeable.\n* Using **interview assistants. It's not very hard to spot.** Even when candidates do a very good job at hiding it in coding interviews and throw in spelling/other mistakes to cover it up, when you pull some hyper-specific library type out of nowhere, or jump directly into coding without being able to reason through it first, or have an extreme mismatch/inconsistencies in the quality of your answers... you can tell. And actually, interviewers are not expecting absolute perfection! We're trying to gauge whether you have the technical, problem-solving, and communication skills to be effective at your job.\n* Resumemaxxing/ai resume and other applicant tools: Really well formatted resumes with lots of metrics were strong positive signals in years past because they were obvious testaments to the candidate's attention to detail and ability to recognize the impact of their work. But now anybody can generate reasonable-looking resume fodder, or a personal website, in 20s. And there are all these tools to help you explain things in terms of your resume during the interview, or directly reach out to hiring managers, or automatically tune your resume for each job posting so now **the standard tips and tricks to \"stand out\" are unimportant or negative signals, unless they're really exceptionally creative.**\n* Trying to feign knowledge or interest in certain tools/products/the company/role without knowing enough about the thing to feign the right way, or trying to confidently explain something made up/embellished/they don't know very well. A lot of candidates who do everything else right struggle with this. The thing is that being able to recognize when you don't know something, and the trust that when someone doesn't know something they'll speak up, is extremely important for early career engineers (whereas in college it's better to guess on an exam than leave it blank). And **50% of the recruiting process is trying to keep out bullshitters, so even a little bit of bullshit can hurt a lot.**\n\nWhat these all have in common is that candidates don't fully understand how they'll be perceived when doing them. I see on this subreddit a lot that all the other candidates are doing these things (not true) so it's just necessary to be competitive as an applicant now. But actually, **so many candidates are doing these things that hiring at the entry-level has become extremely low-trust and challenging, because constant exposure to bullshit has you default to being skeptical of candidates' authenticity, skills, and personality. What you might think makes you look better actually makes you look like the other 60% of applicants coming across inauthentically, who aren't getting hired.**\n\n(cont. below: what to do instead)",

I am happy that CS researchers get paid well and are being recognized, but I wonder if this will now just flood PhD programs with applicants hoping to make it ~~to the NBA~~ , I mean, to a FAANG AI lab.\n\nWill the money result in a shift in the ML research job market and programs? I feel like a potential problem could rise where too many CS departments might underfund and underfocus in other research areas outside ML, which I don't think would be good for computer science.

It’s the only proper job offer I’ve ever received. I came in at the minimum, making a bit over $50k. I was happy to finally have a job.\n\nThe job is stable. Demands are more than reasonable. But with 6 YoE, I make under $80k in a top 10 US metro. I'm in the bottom 20% of my pay band. I’ve argued for raises. Answer is basically, \"why should we?\" It's frustrating, but I realize that if I don't have any offer letters as leverage, then they *don't* have any reason to do anything. And raises are now frozen for *everyone* due to federal funding changes. Meanwhile, my coworkers are in the top half, if not top third or quarter of their pay bands, making $30k+ more than me. And don't even get me started on how I compare to the figures on levels.fyi or Glassdoor.\n\nI’ve been applying since I got my 401k vested, which coincided with the job market starting to fall apart. The search has not been successful or positive or encouraging. It's particularly disheartening to know that people out there with actual expertise and proper CS degrees and double/triple my YoE are also struggling. If *they* can't find jobs, what chance do *I* have?\n\nMaybe I am still behind in some ways, but I *have* improved. I’ve gotten promoted. (Even though the promotion just put me at a lower percentile in my new pay band.) I get positive feedback from PMs and BAs, and a coworker recently said he's even impressed with how far I've come on a history degree and that he thinks I might make a good architect someday. Their praise doesn't translate into anything material, of course.\n\nI had always had an interest in tech, but this is not a case of \"I love code, but the bureaucracy is killing me.\" These days, I *prefer* the requirements gathering and backlog refinement sessions to head-down coding. I didn't exactly get into this field as a fulfillment of a lifelong passion. I think early on I felt gratification in helping people *via* the code. But there's not joy inherent to the code itself. Nowadays, my work feels disconnected from real users. It feels like grinding through abstract problems created by the tools themselves. Some days I wish I never had to touch code ever again.\n\nMaybe my mentality would change if I felt like I had a future, even a path to just being a median developer making a median salary. But right now, I don't see it.\n\nI don't think every person is necessarily cut out for every type of job. Am I just not cut out to be a developer? Or maybe not cut out for it anymore? If I was, or could be, what would that even look like?",

        "content": "\nI’ve been a software engineer for 4 years now, and lately I’ve started to feel like I’m stuck in some kind of loop.\n\nI’m technically mid-level, but my day-to-day hasn’t changed in years. I’m still picking up the same kinds of tickets — bug fixes, basic features, occasional cleanup work. Nothing high-impact, nothing strategic. I rarely get asked for input in planning or architecture discussions. It’s like I’m just… there, floating.\n\nIt’s not that I hate the work. I just thought by now I’d be doing more — maybe mentoring junior devs, leading small projects, or at least working on something that pushes me. But I feel invisible. I get decent performance reviews, but no real guidance on how to grow or get to the next level.\n\nWhat’s worse is, I don’t even know what to do differently. Speak up more? Build something on the side? Apply elsewhere? I keep waiting for some kind of sign that I’m ready, but I’m starting to realize that no one’s coming to hand me that next step.\n\nIf you’ve been stuck in the “mid-level trap,” how did you break out of it? What helped you move forward?",

I will soon be a new grad and I'm concerned that if I choose to \"start small\", then I'll put myself in a box later on. \n\nWhat do you think? Is that statement true? Should I aim big from the get go if that's where I would eventually want to be?\n\nEDIT: This post has gotten a lot more responses than I was prepared for. I am so grateful to everyone for this. I will take this to heart. The general sentiment seems to be that it's okay to start small, which is a huge relief because I'm not sure about big tech just yet but I wouldn't want to close the door forever. I'm thankful to everyone again!!",

        "content": "I'm based in the US. For a bit of background information, I graduated with a bachelor's degree from a top public school back in 2022 and have since been struggling really hard to find a job in the field. During university, I didn't do any internship because I was a first generation in my family and severely underestimated its value. I took a gap year after graduation for mental health reasons and did not start job finding until 2023. In the past 2 years, I've landed less than 10 interviews. Not once did I make it past the first screening, be it technical or behavioral. I'm well aware that the market is struggling right now, but my past decisions to not do any internship or taking the gap year certainly did not help. But that's not what I want to focus on.\n\nDuring my job search, I wasn't selective about the roles in the slightest. I applied to roles that required relocation to the other side of the country, local roles, remote roles, roles in the financial sector, the defense sector, government jobs, etc. If it was an entry level SWE/QA role and I qualified for it, I applied. I know that the longer I stay unemployed, the harder it is to get a foot into the field. For that reason, I've spent most of my days working on projects to keep myself marketable. I have published a mobile app that has 1,500 monthly active users, but that didn't seem to help my chances at all. I would be lucky to even get a rejection email. I feel really lost and don't know what else I can be doing.\n\nLately I've contemplated changing fields or maybe even picking up a skill trade. But that feels like giving up finding a job in this field in the future, since I will have significantly less time to keep my skills marketable. The thought of throwing away all my time and effort saddens me, but this status quo can't last. Luckily, I've been living with my parents so I'm not at risk of homelessness. But I want to live a life and I don't know if I can continue working on projects and applying to applications and pray for an opportunity that may never come. If you were in my position, what would you do? Are there roles that utilize my degree that are in demand? Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thanks for your time.\n\nHere's my resume for the ones that care: [Resume](https://imgur.com/a/88MUfWW)\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for all of the suggestions. I'll be looking into doing a Master's program and getting internships that way. I'll also try to monetize my app and leverage my skills to see if I can start turn it into a business.",

I don’t mind studying leetcode (I like them but haven’t done them in a while) but I’m just not sure if my career gap will hinder my progress in breaking back in. I’m nearing 2 years and though my side hustle is gaining income, I’d still like to get into another SE gig now that I’m refreshed. I have another project I’d like to continue working on but I’m considering studying for leetcode again but not sure what my prospects would look like considering the time off I’ve had in this current market….like would it be worth it? This other side hustle I’m building has the potential to make me thousands per month somewhat passively so theres opportunity cost in pursuing another job in this climate. Anybody out there have similar experience? I don’t think it should be an issue if someone decides they want to take time off at some point but recruiters might not agree with that. I had been grinding and working while going to college for years (switched from EE to SE resulting in more time) and never had a real break in my life. ",

        "author": "SomeRandomCSGuy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "For all the engineers that are feeling invisible, stuck or plateaued, this is for you and hope it helps / guides you into the next steps. \n\nI am a senior software engineer who got to this position pretty fast, and got promoted over other engineers with 3-4x my YoE, so whatever I saw in this post contributed massively to my growth, making my impact visible, getting me recognized, and eventually promoted. \n\nAs a junior engineer, I was always awed by these senior+ engineers who seemed to make such an impact by whatever they did. This led me to start observing and building relationships with some of these really senior engineers around me (staff/principal) and learn how they operated, built that authority around them, and got stuff done, and something clicked. \n\nI realized it wasn’t just about technical skill and crushing tickets. What moved the needle was learning to communicate clearly, understand what impacts the business, build trust, build alignment between stakeholders, and be proactive (taking initiatives) instead of just reactive (wait to get assigned work).\n\nThere is usually a misconception, that to stand out, you just need to work on your technical skills. That is wrong. To get to senior+ you need to hone in on your non-technical skills like communication, how you take initiatives, how you build alignment etc. These are absolutely crucial to be seen as someone with authority, and something most engineers neglect and plateau.\n\nA lot of engineers think that these skills are only required for managers etc, but they are wrong - even ICs require them. \n\nFor these soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing wikis/docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Taking time to write these up can not only promote healthy structured offline discussions (google docs for eg) but also act as an information aggregator for knowledge sharing (instead of being scattered on slack for eg or lost in meetings) and for having an audit log of important decisions - so in the future anyone can refer back to why a decision was taken and one doesn’t have to scramble to remember it, etc. \n\nThe documents that you write now also help you to present your ideas and propose changes in a better manner in live meetings, where you can present that doc during the meetings and walk everyone through it - you don't need to memorize anything since all the information is already there in front of you, in a clean structured manner.\n\nSpeech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.\n\nI worked heavily on my speech. I was afraid to speak in meetings because I was introverted and had confidence issues because I had a bit of stuttering problem, I used to use too many filler words, lose track of thought etc. But I took time to work on it, and over time I started speaking more eloquently and fluently which made such a massive difference in my confidence, and whenever I had to propose something or even speak during meetings, it made a difference. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, technical skills are also important, but as you go up, your mastery of these other non-technical skills starts to matter more. They will make you more visible, your impact more visible, and eventually get you promoted. \n\nSo I urge you to start working on them, you will be surprised just how much difference they make. \n\nIf you are an introvert like me, if I can do it so can you. I used to think these soft skills are reserved for extroverts but I was extremely wrong, and these are most definitely learnable. \n\nLooking forward to hearing in the comments what has worked for other engineers out there as well!\n\nHappy to answer any questions in the comments and DMs! I am an open book and happy to help however I can!",

I also have picked up roles along the way such as parts sales, service coordination, small machine repair (technician quit, they asked if I knew how to repair, said I'll try.

        "author": "tobythestrangler",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hey all, I’ve been working as an intern at a small professional services firm since May of last year (so ~1.5 years now). What started as a short summer internship got extended **four times**, every time with vague mentions that I’d be offered a full-time role once \"we finish X\" or \"get through Y.\"\n\nIn the beginning, I was doing analytics-focused work, i.e., building dashboards, eda/reporting for clients, simple regression tasks. It was great. Then, as the team realized more of the analytics was internally focused, we decided to stop client work and migrate our dashboards into the company website. That’s when things shifted. Since I have a background in data science + some experience with full-stack dev, I became the one spearheading the dashboard migration effort.\n\nFor the next 6+ months, I’ve collaborated directly with the dev team, learning React, GraphQL, MongoDB, Docker, Task Scheduling, and D3.js on the fly. It was messy but fulfilling. We were building these tools with hope of scaling them into client-facing tools eventually.\n\nThroughout this, my boss kept saying I’d be the one maintaining these dashboards and owning future projects, especially because I had context on both the data and the dev side. I even got **another** project last month, again with the implication that I was part of long-term plans.\n\nFast forward to now: all three projects are basically done. The dashboards work, the visuals take in prod data, and we’re just ironing out some small aesthetic issues + a rework of some GraphQL logic for one proejct. \n\nAt 9am today, I get a calendar invite for an \"exit interview.\" No warning. I talk to my boss and he flatly tells me my last day is next week (August 11), and to have everything wrapped up and documented by then. That’s it.\n\nNo full-time offer. No more extensions. No transition into another role. Just \"thanks and bye.\"\n\nHonestly, I’m kind of heartbroken. I poured so much time into this place. Took on projects well outside my scope. Built tools that no one else had the technical background for. I **thought** I was doing everything right. My coworkers were surprised to hear I wasn’t being kept. It’s not just me imagining this either. My boss has consistently dragged his feet on giving me a real answer about my future here.\n\nTruthfully, I didn’t even really \"work\"  today. I spent most of it job hunting and planning to use up my accrued PTO before I go. I’m in grad school part-time (1 year left), which I think has scared off a few employers. And it's all starting to sting a bit... Especially since I've grown close to my coworkers and enjoyed the work. \n\nSide note: this is the second time I've been let go. My first job out of college started as an internship but was extended to full time. However, the company laid me off due to budget slashing post-covid. This time around feels very different.\n\nIs it normal to feel like this? To feel like it’s not worth pushing these final 2% of features anymore? Am I being unprofessional by mentally checking out a week before I’m done?\n\nI just feel burned out, a bit betrayed, and unsure of what’s next. Thanks for reading.",

Have about 150k saved up apart from 401k and IRA which also ends up being about 80-100k.\n\nI am currently okay with my job, pretty comfortable and enjoy it but current team changes and stuff have got me rethinking for a new team or a job. Anyways I have been interviewing and searching rigorously and will probably try to upgrade my job to possibly big tech hopefully in the upcoming year.\n\nI want to move out of my parents house and move to a big city where my work has offices- NYC, Chicago, SF, DC being my options in order of preference. My TC will be about 145-150k. I am a pretty active guy who barely drinks and not materialistic at all. Been feeling that the number in my bank is just a number and don’t feel happy with my current situation. Do you think this is a wise decision? I want to explore and find my community and friends.\n\nI feel stuck living with parents not that I don’t have my freedom but I feel living alone would solve that mental problem. Sometimes I do wish I want to leave my cushy job, travel the world with my money saved up for 6mo to a year. On the way I want to pursue my hobbies like learning instruments, a new language, getting into really good shape, surfing or diving, and also try to start a business or find a remote tech job and be a digital nomad.\n\nWhat advice would you give me given my current situation?\n\nEDIT: Traveling solo 6mo-1yr has been a bucket list goal of mine. Should have made that clear before. I want to do it and no matter how cheesy it sounds it’s something I dreamt about 10 years ago and still think about everyday. I do want a family and kids where I don’t have worry about money but that’s like PART 2 of what I want from life. PART1 has been being a SWE and living in NYC and traveling the world for a year ish. Hopefully that makes sense. It’s wishful thinking but yeah.\n\nSomething that keeps my mind at ease with not worrying about money is: Happiness is relative! \n",

        "content": "Tired. 1 year experience software developer. Since I joined my tech lead has had a pretty short temper. 6 months in said he basically doesn’t even know how to help me. My second manager made an 8 point per sprint requirement and said I didn’t have to do it, then it became a performance issue when I didn’t do it. Very confused. \n\nNow the thing is I “ask too many questions” and am not technically independent. \n\nI’m tired. \n\nI do all my stories. I never caused carry over or even a defect. I always take notes after asking a question so I never ask the same question twice. I have multiple certs. Was in a hackathon. If I’m struggling so much, how am I completing all my work before the deadline? \n\nWhen I ask a question, I always say what I tried first. I never ask without trying and saying what I tried because that’s annoying. \n\nI don’t communicate well with my tech lead because he always gets irritated very quickly towards me. Use to laugh and snap at me when I code constantly. Didn’t want to deal with that so I route questions elsewhere.\n\nHad multiple managers and they’re just like “oh if you just do x  (replace x with study outside of work, try before asking a question, say what you tried before asking a question), then they’ll be nicer to you”. Like….ok….havent I been doing that for a year straight?\n\nAnd apparently performance reviews aren’t based on actual goals, but vibes. No one has given me goals yet. I don’t pass my tech leads vibe check so all feedback from him is negative. \n\nI don’t know what they want from me. How do I even improve at this point? I study outside of work, I use ai, like…do I just suck at my job? Do I suck at this field? I don’t get it. \n\nWent to hr, they said “sounds like you’re just complaining that you have to do your work.” \n\nI can get another job, but is that best? Is this a team specific problem?  I think tech is cool, but is my brain just not cut for this?\n\n\n\n",

Now, this was my first time, I didn’t prep as much as I should have, and I also have adhd so I tend to be slower anyway (i get double time in school and use it).

Most of those solutions do not need large scale system design, you may use containers, may be K8s if you are lucky. But mostly do not need hundreds of microservices, CQRS, event-driven stuff. Even if we have freedom of tech stack we are doing disservice to client and future developers if you did something complicated for resume driven development. While I can try and learn new design patterns, good coding practices, there is no room to build things at scale.\n\nBut when you look at jobs posts, they ask for things like microservices, event-driven design, CQRS, Kafka etc. So my question to those who were in similar situation before, **how to gain experience building things at scale when your work do not need things at scale?** It seems I have been stagnant years without opportunity to involve in systems that need scale.\n",

Naturally, I’ve been considering pursuing a degree in Computer Science.\n\nHowever, with all the recent discussions around AI, I’m starting to question whether a CS degree is still a good investment. I’ve seen a lot of posts about how the job market for tech is tough right now, but some people say it’s still not as bad as it was back in the early 2000s. Honestly, I’m a bit confused and unsure what to believe. I’ve talked to people about this and have received mixed results. I’ve talked to two professors who believe that the thought of AI completely replacing programmers is nonsense although it is still a very useful tool. On the other hand, I have family members that work in IT that believe that programming jobs as we know it are basically over.\n\nI’m also planning to double major in CS and Applied Math. I’m hoping that the math degree could give me some flexibility and open up other career options in case the CS job market remains difficult, what are your guys thoughts on that?\n\nAm I overthinking this? Is CS still worth pursuing given the current trends?\n\nAlso im not sure if this is the right place to ask this type of question. If its not what other subs should I ask?",

        "content": "When I was a teenager, I developed an interest in programming. I spent countless hours following tutorials and building small projects. Naturally, I decided to major in Computer Science, hoping it would lead to a great job someday.\n\nBut I didn’t realize how difficult that would be—mainly because I live in Iraq, where there’s very little demand for software developers. And when a job does open up, the competition is fierce.\n\nAfter graduating in 2020, I couldn’t find a job for about six months. Eventually, I took a job as a trainer instead of a developer just to pay the bills. During that time, I kept applying to every local and remote opportunity I could find.\n\nAfter two years as a trainer, and out of sheer luck, I landed a paid internship as a full-stack developer. It was borderline slave labor, but I needed the experience. The pay wasn’t bad considering the living costs here. The role was fully remote and contract-based for a U.S. startup.\n\nWhen the internship ended, they offered me a junior full-stack role—again contract-based for six months. But then the startup failed to secure funding, and I was let go.\n\nI was unemployed again for six months until someone I used to work with reached out. They were starting a new company and offered me a frontend position. I worked as the only frontend engineer for eight months. It was another contract gig since they couldn’t legally hire someone from Iraq. The workload was heavy, but I delivered.\n\nThen, once again, the startup failed to get funding and I was let go.\n\nNow I’m working part-time in a government job that has nothing to do with coding. I can’t seem to find any local developer roles or remote contracts anymore. I’ve started to question whether I’m even cut out for a career in software development.\n\nShould I keep looking for a job? Pursue a master’s degree? Switch to a different field entirely? What would you do if you were in my shoes? What does your career path look like?",

I have had several interviews for intern software developer roles, and despite answering all the questions correctly, I was still rejected (I suspect it is due to my lack of working experience).\n\nSo my question is what do I do here? If I can’t get work experience before I graduate, how am I ever gonna find a job.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",

        "content": "In 2026, I'm going to be a grad fresh out of college in Ireland. I want to break into high frequency trading as a SWE and had a roadmap set in my mind for how I would reach my goal in 2 - 3 years time. I wanted to have people's opinion on how realistic this is.\n\n  \nCurrently as part of my placement year (more like semester), I'm interning at IBM. I'm working on Db2 which is IBM's enterprise database solution. If I get a return offer, hopefully, this is what I'll continue working on. Now, I know to break into HFT, I'll need a lot of experience in C++ and I was hoping this opportunity would give me that. I have considered applying to HFT firms but I feel like I won't be able to make it past their interviews since I'm not prepared much in that area and also am quite inexperienced in C++. As Db2 is a database, I'm also getting experience in low latency/high transaction systems, solving concurrency problems. I feel like these are all skills HFT firms value. I understand I'll be lacking in the area of financial knowledge. After 2 years of working here, I hope to get a Master's done with a minor in Finance, after which I plan on applying to HFTs.\n\n  \nWould you say this plan is realistic or are there some changes you would suggest?\n\n  \nThanks as always :)",

I’m very open to any kind of advice, how much further I need to progress to land an internship or entry-level job, what I could be doing better, or what I should avoid completely.\n\n\\*edit:\n\nThank you so much for all your comments! I'm currently trying to work on a project using TypeScript. Coming from JavaScript, the errors and project setup feel a bit strange at first, but from what I’ve seen, moving forward with TypeScript seems like the most sensible path. Thanks again to everyone!",

        "author": "Rumple__4skin",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Background (skip further down if you don't care):\nI'm a SENG with 3+ years working on a product that was acquired by Trimble in 2023. Nobody knew we were getting acquired besides our CEO at the time. When they told us our new salaries I'm not sure what they were based on since the lead (who actually knows what I do) wasn't involved at all. I wasn't exactly happy with my new salary compared to my coworkers so I spoke with my manager (formerly the lead) and told him I'll take on more work/responsibility so I can get a promotion down the line. So I bust my ass for 1.5 years and finally he tells me he's submitting a request that I'm promoted with the higher ups. Fast forward *8 months*, nothing. Two performance reviews during this time and my manager doesn't really know what's going on, no updates from anyone. So I'm frustrated, burnt out, unmotivated, and feel taken advantage of.\n\nMy question (skip here):\nIn my search for a new job I have an opportunity at Stripe. Stripe pays twice what I'm paid at Trimble but the internet tells me the wlb and culture there sucks, like Amazon bad. Now I'm fine with occasionally working late but it can't be every day and I can put up with annoying coworkers if I can just focus on my work and don't deal with them much. In contrast I love my coworkers where I currently am, we're all buddies. The culture at our office is amazing, but the work itself isn't always great as I'm constantly helping other teams. \n\nSo is the pay at Stripe really worth it? Do I just take the leap and see how it goes? I don't want to be miserable at my job but I also want to get paid what I know I'm worth.",

I have a lot to learn from them and I've already picked up more than I ever did in college. With that being said, they're also fairly young. I barely know what I'm doing, and while I trust their technical skills, this seems to be their first time in a mentorship position. They've expressed to me that they're always open to advice, but I, the mentee, am not sure I trust myself to give that feedback. \n\nMy question is this: What does good mentorship look like? How can I guide my mentors towards helping me develop a useful set of skills? And how will I know if we're on the right track?",
