To be honest regardless of the the fivetran acquisition, dbt-core never got any improvement over time. And it always neglected community contributions. \n\n[OpenDBT](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt) fork is created to solve this problem. Enabling community to extend dbt to their own needs and evolve opensource version and make it feature rich.\n\n[OpenDBT](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt) dynamically extends dbt-core. It's already adding significant features that aren't in the dbt-core. This is a path toward a complete community-driven fork.\n\nWe are inviting developers and the wider data community to collaborate. \n\nPlease check out the features we've already added, star the repo, and feel free to submit a PR! \n\n[https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt)",

The rest of us end up picking up the slack, and it’s starting to affect team morale and delivery.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with a “know-it-all but lazy” type like this?

What annoys me are not the posts themselves, but the culture and the companies making believe that all this is necessary. So i feel like people need to manage their expectations. In themselves and  in the companies they work for. The following are OPINIONS of mine that help me to check in with myself.\n\n1. You are not the company and the company is not you. If they want you to use a new tool, they need to provide PAID time for you to learn the tool.\n\n2. Don't do personal projects (unless you REALLY enjoy it). It just takes time you could have spend doing literally anything else. Personal projects will not prepare you for the real thing because the data isn't as messy,  the business is not as annoying and you want have to deal with coworkers breaking production pipelines. \n\n3. Nobody cares about certifications. If I have to do a certification, I want to be paid for it and not pay for it.\n\n4. Life over work. Always.\n\n5. Don't beat yourself up, if you don't know something. It's fine. Try it out and fail. Try again. (During work hours of course)\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, i read stuff in my offtime as well and i am in this reddit. But i only as long I enjoy it. Don't feel pressured to do anything because you think you need it for your career or some youtube guy told you to.\n\n\n\n",

I deployed a local Git server, maintain and own the DB instance that hosts our DWH, re-implemented and redesigned Python dashboards because the old implementation was slow and useless, deployed some infrastructure for data engineering workloads, developed cli frameworks to cut-off manual work and code redundancy, and harmonized inconsistent sources to produce accurate insights (they used to just dump Excel files and DB tables into SSIS, which generated wrong numbers) all locally.\n\nLast Thursday, we got a request with a deadline on Sunday, even though Friday and Saturday are our weekend (I’m in Egypt, and my team is currently working from home to deliver it, for free).\n\nAt first, I didn’t mind because I wanted to deliver and learn, but now I’m getting frustrated. I barely have time to rest, let alone learn new things that could actually help me grow (technically or financially).\n\nUnpaid overtime is normalized here, and changing companies locally won’t fix that. So I’ve started thinking about moving to Europe, but I’m not sure I’m ready for such a competitive market since everything we do is on-prem and I’ve never touched cloud platforms.\n\nAnother issue: I feel like the only technical person in the office. When I talk about software design, abstraction, or maintainability, nobody really gets it. They just think I’m “going fancy,” which leaves me on-call. \n\nOne time, I recommended loading all our sources into a 3rd normal form schema as a single source of truth, because the same piece of information was scattered across multiple systems and needed tracking, enforcement, and auditing before hitting our Kimball DWH. They looked at me like I was a nerd trying to create extra work.\n\nI’m honestly feeling trapped.\nShould I keep grinding, or start planning my exit to a better environment (like Europe or remote)?\nAny advice from people who’ve been through this?\n",

        "content": "Hi!\n\nAs part of a client I’m working with, I was planning to migrate quite an old data platform to what many would consider a modern data stack (dagster/airlfow + DBT + data lakehouse). Their current data estate is quite outdated (e.g. single step function manually triggered, 40+ state machines running lambda scripts to manipulate data. Also they’re on Redshit and connect to Qlik for BI. I don’t think they’re willing to change those two), and as I just recently joined, they’re asking me to modernise it. The modern data stack mentioned above is what I believe would work best and also what I’m most comfortable with. \n\nNow the question is, as DBT has been acquired by Fivetran a few weeks ago, how would you tackle the migration to a completely new modern data stack? Would DBT still be your choice even if not as “open” as it was before and the uncertainty around maintenance of dbt-core? Or would you go with something else? I’m not aware of any other tool like DBT that does such a good job in transformation.\n\nAm I unnecessarily worrying and should I still go with proposing DBT? Sorry if a similar question has been asked already but couldn’t find anything on here.\n\nThanks!",

I always wanted to work in a data engineering project and recently i got an opportunity to work on a project which seem to be exciting with GenAI & Python stuff. My role here is to develop python scripts to integrate multiple sources and LLM outputs and package everything into a solution. I designed a config driven ETL code using python and wrote multiple classes to package everything into a single codebase. I used LLM chats to optimise my code. Due to very tight deadlines I had to rush the development without realising the whole thing would turn into a nightmare. I have tried my best to follow the coding standards but the client is very upset about few parts of the design. A couple of days ago, I had a code review meeting with my client team where I had to walk through my code and answer questions inorder to get the approval for QA. The client team had an architect level manager who had already gone through the repository and had a lot of valid questions about the design flaws in the code. I felt very embarrassed during the meeting and it was a very awkward conversation. Everytime he had pointed out something wrong, I had no answers to it and there was silence for about half a minute before I say \" Ok I can implement that\". I know it is my fault that I didn't have enough knowledge about designing data systems but I'm worried more about tarnishing my companies' reputation by providing a low quality deliverable. I just wanted to rant about how disappointed I feel about myself. Have you ever been in a situation like this?",

Each split maximizes:\n\n\n\nGain = GradientGain + λ·InformationGain\n\n\n\nwhere λ adapts based on class imbalance. This explicitly optimizes for information gain on the minority class instead of just minimizing loss.\n\nCombined with:\n\n\\- Quantile-based binning (robust to scale shifts)\n\n\\- Conservative regularization (prevents overfitting to majority)\n\n\\- PR-AUC early stopping (focuses on minority performance)\n\nThe architecture is inherently more robust to drift without needing online adaptation.\n\n Trade-offs\n\nThe good:\n\n\\- Auto-tunes for your data (no hyperparameter search needed)\n\n\\- Works out-of-the-box on extreme imbalance\n\n\\- Comparable inference speed to XGBoost\n\nThe honest:\n\n\\- \\~2-4x slower training (45s vs 12s on 170K samples)\n\n\\- Slightly behind on balanced data (use XGBoost there)\n\n\\- Built in Rust, so less Python ecosystem integration\n\n Why I'm Sharing\n\nThis started as a learning project (built from scratch in Rust), but the drift resilience results surprised me. I haven't seen many papers addressing this - most focus on online learning or explicit drift detection.\n\nLooking for feedback on:\n\n\\- Have others seen similar robustness from conservative regularization?\n\n\\- Are there existing techniques that achieve this without retraining?\n\n\\- Would this be useful for production systems, or is 2-4x slower training a dealbreaker?\n\n\n\n Links\n\n\\- GitHub: [https://github.com/Pushp-Kharat1/pkboost](https://github.com/Pushp-Kharat1/pkboost)\n\n\\- Benchmarks include: Credit Card Fraud, Pima Diabetes, Breast Cancer, Ionosphere\n\n\\- MIT licensed, \\~4000 lines of Rust\n\nHappy to answer questions about the implementation or share more detailed results.

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "As part of a wider move towards data products as well as building better controls into our pipelines, we’re looking at how we can implement data contracts as code. I’ve done a number of proof of concepts across various options and currently the Open Data Contract Specification alongside datacontract-cli is looking good. However, while I see how it can work well with “frozen” contracts, I start getting lost on how to allow schema evolution. \n\nOur typical scenarios for Python-based data ingestion pipelines are all batch-based, consisting of files being pushed to us or our pulling from database tables. Our ingestion pattern is to take the producer dataset, write it to parquet for performant operations, and then validate it with schema and quality checks. The write to parquet (with PyArrow’s ParquetWriter) should include the contract schema to enforce the agreed or known datatypes. \n\nHowever, with dynamic schema evolution, you ideally need to capture the schema of the dataset to be able to compare it to your current contract state to alert for breaking changes etc. Contract-first formats like ODCS take a bit of work to define, plus you may have zero-padded numbers defined as varchar in the source data you want to preserve, so inferring that schema for comparison becomes challenging. \n\nI’ve gone down quite a rabbit hole now and am likely overcooking it, but my current thinking is to write all dataset fields to parquet as string, validate the data formats are as expected, and then subsequent pipeline steps can be more flexible with inferred schemas. I think I can even see a way to integrate this with dlt. \n\nHow do others approach this?",

        "author": "Practical_Double_595",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I've been benchmarking ClickHouse 25.9.4.58 against Exasol on TPC-H workloads and am looking for specific guidance to improve ClickHouse's performance. Despite enabling statistics and applying query-specific rewrites, I'm seeing ClickHouse perform 4-10x slower than Exasol depending on scale factor. If you've tuned ClickHouse for TPC-H-style workloads at these scales on r5d.\\* instances (or similar) and can share concrete settings, join rewrites, or schema choices that move the needle on **Q04/Q08/Q09/Q18/Q19/Q21** in particular, I'd appreciate detailed pointers.\n\nSpecifically, I'm looking for advice on:\n\n**1. Join strategy and memory**\n\n* Recommended settings for large, many-to-many joins on TPC-H shapes (e.g., guidance on `join_algorithm` choices and thresholds for spilling vs in-memory)\n* Practical values for `max_bytes_in_join`, `max_rows_in_join`, `max_bytes_before_external_*` to reduce spill/regressions on Q04/Q18/Q19/Q21\n* Whether using grace hash or partial/merge join strategies is advisable on SF30+ when relations don't fit comfortably in RAM\n\n**2. Optimizer + statistics**\n\n* Which statistics materially influence join reordering and predicate pushdown for TPC-H-like SQL (and how to scope them: which tables/columns, histograms, sampling granularity)\n* Any caveats where cost-based changes often harm (Q04/Q14 patterns), and how to constrain the optimizer to avoid those plans\n\n**3. Query-level idioms**\n\n* Preferred ClickHouse-native patterns for EXISTS/NOT EXISTS (especially Q21) that avoid full scans/aggregations while keeping memory under control\n* When to prefer IN/SEMI/ANTI joins vs INNER/LEFT; reliable anti-join idioms that plan well in 25.9\n* Safe uses of PREWHERE, `optimize_move_to_prewhere`, and read-in-order for these queries\n\n**4. Table design details that actually matter here**\n\n* Any proven primary key / partitioning / LowCardinality patterns for TPC-H `lineitem`/`orders`/`part*` tables that the optimizer benefits from in 25.9\n\n**So far I've been getting the following results**\n\n**Test environment**\n\n* **Systems under test:** Exasol 2025.1.0 and ClickHouse 25.9.4.58\n* **Hardware:** AWS r5d.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 124 GB RAM, eu-west-1)\n* **Methodology:** One warmup, 7 measured runs, reporting medians\n* **Data:** Generated with dbgen, CSV input\n\n**Full reports**\n\n* **SF1:** Exasol vs ClickHouse (baseline, stats-enabled, query-tuned) [https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa\\_vs\\_ch\\_1g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html](https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa_vs_ch_1g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html)\n* **SF10:** Exasol vs ClickHouse (same three variants) [https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa\\_vs\\_ch\\_10g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html](https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa_vs_ch_10g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html)\n* **SF30:** Exasol vs ClickHouse (same three variants) [https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa\\_vs\\_ch\\_30g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html](https://exasol.github.io/benchkit/exa_vs_ch_30g/reports/2-results/REPORT.html)\n\n**Headline results (medians; lower is better)**\n\n* **SF1 system medians:** Exasol 19.9ms; ClickHouse 86.2ms; ClickHouse\\_stat 89.4ms; ClickHouse\\_tuned 91.8ms\n* **SF10 system medians:** Exasol 63.6ms; ClickHouse\\_stat 462.1ms; ClickHouse 540.7ms; ClickHouse\\_tuned 553.0ms\n* **SF30 system medians:** Exasol 165.9ms; ClickHouse 1608.8ms; ClickHouse\\_tuned 1615.2ms; ClickHouse\\_stat 1659.3ms\n\n**Where query tuning helped**\n\n**Q21** (the slowest for ClickHouse in my baseline):\n\n* SF1: 552.6ms -> 289.2ms (tuned); Exasol 22.5ms\n* SF10: 6315.8ms -> 3001.6ms (tuned); Exasol 106.7ms\n* SF30: 20869.6ms -> 9568.8ms (tuned); Exasol 261.9ms\n\n**Where statistics helped (notably on some joins)**\n\n**Q08:**\n\n* SF1: 146.2ms (baseline) -> 88.4ms (stats); Exasol 17.6ms\n* SF10: 1629.4ms -> 353.7ms; Exasol 30.7ms\n* SF30: 5646.5ms -> 1113.6ms; Exasol 60.7ms\n\n**Q09** also improved with statistics at SF10/SF30, but remains well above Exasol.\n\n**Where tuning/statistics hurt or didn't help**\n\n* **Q04:** tuning made it much slower - SF10 411.7ms -> 1179.4ms; SF30 1410.4ms -> 4707.0ms\n* **Q18:** tuning regressed - SF10 719.7ms -> 1941.1ms; SF30 2556.2ms -> 6865.3ms\n* **Q19:** tuning regressed - SF10 547.8ms -> 1362.1ms; SF30 1618.7ms -> 3895.4ms\n* **Q20:** tuning regressed - SF10 114.0ms -> 335.4ms; SF30 217.2ms -> 847.9ms\n* **Q21** with statistics alone barely moved vs baseline (still multi-second to multi-tens-of-seconds at SF10/SF30)\n\n**Queries near parity or ClickHouse wins**\n\nQ15/Q16/Q20 occasionally approach parity or win by a small margin depending on scale/variant, but they don't change overall standings. Examples:\n\n* SF10 Q16: 192.7ms (ClickHouse) vs 222.7ms (Exasol)\n* SF30 Q20: 217.2ms (ClickHouse) vs 228.7ms (Exasol)\n\n**ClickHouse variants and configuration**\n\n1. **Baseline:** ClickHouse configuration remained similar to my first post; highlights below\n2. **ClickHouse\\_stat:** enabled optimizer with table/column statistics\n3. **ClickHouse\\_tuned:** applied ClickHouse-specific rewrites (e.g., EXISTS/NOT EXISTS patterns and alternative join/filter forms) to a subset of queries; results above show improvements on Q21 but regressions elsewhere\n\n**Current ClickHouse config highlights**\n\n    max_threads = 16\n    max_memory_usage = 45 GB\n    max_server_memory_usage = 106 GB\n    max_concurrent_queries = 8\n    max_bytes_before_external_sort = 73 GB\n    join_use_nulls = 1\n    allow_experimental_correlated_subqueries = 1\n    optimize_read_in_order = 1\n    allow_experimental_statistics = 1       # on ClickHouse_stat\n    allow_statistics_optimize = 1           # on ClickHouse_stat\n\n**Summary of effectiveness so far**\n\n* Manual query rewrites improved Q21 consistently across SF1/SF10/SF30 but were neutral/negative for several other queries; net effect on whole-suite medians is minimal\n* Enabling statistics helped specific join-heavy queries (notably Q08/Q09), but overall medians remained 7-10x behind Exasol depending on scale",

        "content": "Background: the enterprise DE in my org manages the big data environment.  He uses nifi for orchestration and snowflake for the data warehouse. As far as how his environment is actually put together and communicating all I know is that he uses zookeeper for his nifi cluster and it’s on the cloud (Azure). There is no one who knows anything more than that. No one in IT. Not his boss. Not his one employee. No one knows and his reason is that he doesn’t trust anyone and they aren’t good enough, not even his employee.\n\n\nThe discussion. Have you dealt with such a person? How has your org dealt with people gatekeeping like this? \n\nFrom my perspective this is a massive problem and basically means that this guy is a massive walking pile of technical debt. If he leaves then the clean up and troubleshooting to figure out what he did would be immense.  On top of that he now has suggested taking over smaller DE processes from other outside IT as a play to “centralize” data engineering work. He won’t let them migrate their stuff to his environment as again he doesn’t rust them to be good enough and doesn’t want to teach them how to use his environment. So he is just safe guarding his job really and taking away others jobs in my opinion.  I also recently got some people in IT to approve me setting up Airflow outside of IT and to do data engineering (which I was already doing but just with cron). He has thrown some shots at me but I ignored him because I’m trying to set something up for other people to use to and document it so that it can be maintained should I leave.\n\nTLDR have you dealt with people gatekeeping knowledge and what happened to them?",

Therefore, I want to download the files and store them temporarily, upload them to Google Drive and then remove them.\n\nFirst, I tried to download them to a lakehouse, but I then understood that removing files in Lakehouse is only a soft-delete and that it still stores it for 7 days, and I want to avoid being billed for all those GBs...\n\nSo, to my question. ChatGPT proposed that I download the files into a folder like \"/tmp/\\*filename.csv\\*\", and supposedly when I do that I use the ephemeral memory created when running the notebook, and then the files will be automatically removed when the notebook is finished running.\n\nThe solution works and I cannot see the files in my lakehouse, so from my point of view the solution works. BUT, I cannot find any documentation of using this method, so I am curious as to how this really works? Have any of you used this method before? Are the files really deleted after the notebook finishes? Is there any better way of doing this? \n\n  \nThankful for any answers!\n\n ",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a beginner data engineer (~1 yoe in DE), we have built a python ingestion framework that does the following:\n\n1. Fetches data in chunks from RDS table\n2. Loads dataframes to Snowflake tables using put stream to SF stage and COPY INTO.\n\nConfig for each source table in RDS, target table in Snowflake, filters to apply etc are maintained in a snowflake table which is fetched before each Ingestion Job.\nThese ingestion jobs need to run on a schedule, therefore we created cronjobs on an on-prem VM (yes, 1 VM) that triggers the python ingestion script (daily, weekly, monthly for different source tables).\nWe are moving to EKS by containerizing the ingestion code and using Kubernetes Cronjobs to achieve the same behaviour as earlier (cronjobs in VM). There are other options like Glue, Spark etc but client wants EKS, so we went with it. Our team is also pretty new, so we lack experience to say \"Hey, instead of EKS, use this\". \nThe ingestion module is just a bunch of python scripts with some classes and functions. How much can performance be improved if I follow a worker pattern where workers pull from a job queue (AWS SQS?) and do just plain extract and load from rds to snowflake. The workers can be deployed as a kubernetes deployment with scalable replicas of workers. A master pod/deployment can handle orchestration of job queue (adding, removing, tracking ingestion jobs).\nI beleive this approach can scale well compared to Cronjobs approach where each pod that handles ingestion job can only have access to finite resources enforced by resources.limits.cpu and mem.\n\nPlease give me your suggestions regarding the current approach and new design idea. Feel free to ridicule, mock, destroy my ideas. As a beginner DE i want to learn best practices when it comes to data ingestion particularly at scale. At what point do i decide to switch from existing to a better pattern?\n\nThanks in advance!!!",

        "author": "fabkosta",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Recently I have been contemplating the idea of a \"data ontology\" on top of Apache Iceberg. The idea is that within a domain you can change data schema in any way you intend using default Apache Iceberg functionality. However, when you publish a data product such that it can be consumed by other data domains then the schema of your data product is frozen, and there is some technical enforcement of the data schema such that the upstream provider domain cannot simply break the schema of the data product thus causing trouble for the downstream consumer domain. Whenever a schema change of the data product is required then the upstream provider domain must go through an official change request with version control etc. that must be accepted by the downstream consumer domain.\n\nObviously, building the full product would be highly complicated with all the bells and whistles attached. But building a small PoC to showcase could be achievable in a realistic timeframe.\n\nNow, I have been wondering:\n\n1. What do you generally think of such an idea? Am I onto something here? Would there be demand for this? Would Apache Iceberg be the right tech for that?\n\n2. I could not find this idea implemented anywhere. There are things that come close (like Starburst's data catalogue) but nothing that seems to actually technically enforce schema change for data products. From what I've seen most products seem to either operate at a lower level (e.g. table level or file level), or they seem to not actually enforce data product schemas but just describe their schemas. Am I missing something here?",

        "content": "Hello everyone, I'm doing a part time as a customer service for an online class. I basically manage the students, their related informations, sessions bought, etc. Also relates it to the class that they are enrolled in. At the moment, all this information is stored in a monolithic sheets (well I did divide atleast the student data and the class, connect them by id).\n\nBut, I'm a CS student, and I just studied dbms last semester, this whole premise sounds like a perfect case to implement what I learn and design a relational database!\n\nSo, I'm here to crosscheck my plan. I plan this with gpt.. btw, because I can't afford to spend too much time working on this side project, and I'm not going to be paid for this extra work either, but then I believe this will help me a ton at my work, and I will also learn a bunch after designing the schema and seeing in real time how the database grows.\n\nSo the plan is use a local instance of postgreSQL with a frontend like NocoDB for spreadsheets like interface. So then I have the fallback of using NocoDB to edit my data, or when I can, and I will try to, always use SQL, or atleast make my own interface to manage the data.\n\nHere's some considerations why I should move to this approach:\n1. The monolithic sheets, one spreadsheets have too much column (phone number, name, classes bought, class id, classes left, last class date, note, complains, (sales related data like age, gender, city, learning objective). And just yesterday, I had a call with my manager, and she says that I should also includes payment information, and 2 types of complains, and I was staring at the long list of the data in the spreadsheets..\n2. I have a pain point of syncing two different sheets. So my company uses other service of spreadsheets (not google) and there is coworker that can't access this site from their country. So, I, again, need to update both of this spreadsheet, and the issue is my company have trust issue with google, so I would also need to filter some data before putting it into the google spreadsheet, from the company one. Too much hassle.\nWhat I hope to achievr from migrating to sql, is that I can just sync them both to my local instance of SQL instead of from one to the other.\n\ncons of this approach (that i know of):\nThis infrastructure will then depends on me, and I think I would need a no-code solution in the future if there will be other coworker in my position. \n\nOther approach being considered:\n Just refactore the sheets that mimics relational db (students, classes, enrolls_in, teaches_in, payment, complains)\nBut then having to filter and sync across the other sheets will still be an issue.\n\nI've read a post somewhere about a teacher that tried to do this kind of thing, basically a student management system. And then it just became a burden for him, needing him to maintain an ecosystem without being paid for it.\n\nBut from what I see, this approach seems need little maintenance and effort to keep up, so only the initial setup will be hard. But feel free to prove me wrong!\n\nThat's about it, I hope you all can give me insights whether or not this journey I'm about to take will be fruitful. I'm open to other suggestions and critics!",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Some fact tables are fairly straightforward, others can be very complicated. I'm working on a extremely complicated composite metric fact table, the output metric is computed queries/combinations/logic from \\~15 different business process fact tables. From a quality standpoint I am very concerned about transparency and explainability of this final metric. So, in addition to the metric value, I'm also considering writing to the fact the values which were used to create the desired metric, with their vintage and other characteristics. So, for example if the metric M=A+B+C-D-E+F-G+H-I; then I would not only store each value, but also the point in time it was pulled from source \\[some of these values are very volatile and are essentially sub queries with logic/filters\\]. For example: A\\_Value = xx, B\\_Value = yyy, C\\_value = zzzz, A\\_TimeStamp = 10/24/25 3:56AM, B\\_Timestamp = 10/24/25 1:11AM, C\\_Timestamp = 10/24/25 6:47AM.\n\nYou can see here that M was created using data from very different points of time, and in this case the data can change a lot within a few hours. \\[data is not only being changed by a 24x7 global business, but also by system batch processing on schedule\\] If someone else uses the same formula, but data from later points in time they might get a different result (and yes, we would ideally wish A,B,C...  to be from the same point in time). \n\n\n\nIs this a design pattern being used? Is there a better way? Is there resources I can use to learn more about this? \n\n  \n\n\nAgain, I wouldn't use this in all designs, only those of sufficient complexity to create better visibility as to \"why the value is what it is\" (when others might disagree and argue because they used the same formula with data from different points in time or filters). \n\n\\*\\* note: I'm considering techniques to ensure all formula components are from the same \"time\" (aka: using time travel in Snowflake, or similar techniques) - but for this question, I'm only concerned about the data modeling to capture/record artifacts used for data quality / explainability.

Instead, it acts like a profile table that holds the source exam IDs and is used as a lookup to populate exam keys in other fact tables.\n\nLet’s say the source system permanently deletes an exam ID (for example, DataSourceExamID = 123). How should I handle this in our data warehouse?\n\nI’m thinking of updating the ExamKey value in Fact\\_Exam and Fact\\_Result to a default value like -1 that corresponds to Exam ID 123, and then deleting that Exam ID 123 row from the Exam table.\n\nI’m not sure if this is even the correct approach. Also, considering that the ExamKey is used in many other fact tables, I don’t think this is an efficient process, as I’d have to check and update several fact tables before deleting. Marking the records in the Exam table is not an option for me.\n\nPlease suggest any best approaches to handle this.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "At work (30-person B2B SaaS), we’re currently debating evolving our data schema. The founders cobbled something together 10 years ago on AWS and through some patching and upgrading, we’ve scaled to 10,000 users, typically sales reps.\n\nOne challenge we’ve long faced is data analysis. We take raw JSON records from CRMs/VOIPs/etc, filter them using conditions, and turn them into performance records on another table. These “promoted” JSON records are then pushed to RedShift where we can do some deeper analysis (such as connecting companies and contacts together, or tying certain activities back to deals, and then helping clients to answer more complex questions than “how many meetings have my team booked this week?”). Without going much deeper, going from performance records back to JSON records and connecting them to associated records but only those that have associated performance… Yeah, it’s not great. \n\nThe evolved data schema we’re considering is a star schema making use of our own model that can transform records from various systems into this model’s common format. So “company” records from Salesforce, HubSpot, and half a dozen all CRMs are all represented relatively similarly (maybe a few JSON properties we’d keep in a JSON column for display only). \n\nCurrent tables we’re sat on are dimensions for very common things like users, companies, and contacts. Facts are for activities (calls, emails, meetings, tasks, notes etc) and deals.\n\nMy worry is that any case of a star schema being used that I’ve come across has been for internal analytics - very rarely a multi-tenant architecture for customer data. We’re prototyping with Tinybird which sits on top of Clickhouse. There’s a lot of stuff for us to consider around data deletion, custom properties per integration and so on, but that’s for another day. \n\nDoes this overall approach sit ok with you? Anything feel off or set off alarm bells? \n\nAppreciate any thoughts or comments!",

While I am currently using Postgres, my needs are better suited for an OLAP datababase so I am curious if this is still the best option. What are the good options on Vercel for this?\n\nI looked at Motherduck and looks like it is a good option, but one challenge I am seeing is that the WASM client would be exposing the tokens to the customer. Given that it is a multi-tenant applications, I would need to create a user per tennant and do that user management myself. If I go with MotherDuck, my alternative is to move my webapp to a proper nodejs deployment where I don't need to depend on WASM client. Its doable but a lot of overhead to manage.\n\nThis seems like a problem that should already be solved in 2025, AGI is around the corner, this should be easy :D .

Let me give some generic advice: try doing it without AI.\n\nIn the olden times, it was not uncommon for learners to have a project that did not work, and they could not figure out why. Now, thanks to AI, learners have a project that does work, and they can't figure out why.\n\nAI is not always bad or evil, but likewise, it definitely isn't always helpful. Learning requires reading, trying, making mistakes, getting confused, reading more, trying more, and repeating. \n\nStart small -- there's a reason \"hello world\" is a common first task -- the actual coding is ridiculously simple, but it proves that your have done all of the necessary work to get your environment properly running. Once you've got that working, you can move on to something more complicated.\n\nI've seen a lot of people who, with the help of AI, start with a much bigger project. AI helps them get that bigger project running, but they don't fully understand what was done to reach that point, which means they're not able to successfully make changes or fixes to that project.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with googling. There's nothing wrong with asking AI a question. But your best bet is to spend some time thinking and trying on your own before using either tool. My advice to anyone learning with AI: don't let AI read or write your code. If you're going to ask AI questions, do so in English. Use AI to help you find the terminology that you don't yet know, and once you've learned the right words, spend some time reading about what they mean. ",

I need to inspect where this object is being constructed.\n* The instance of MyServiceClient being passed to CallAction, where is it being passed?\n* I can't find a CallAction constructor call anywhere, so I don't know where MyServiceClient is coming from.\n* Maybe I can figure it by searching the codebase for all the methods that return a MyServiceClient.\n* There are multiple methods that return MyServiceClient, and none of them are called anywhere in the codebase.\n* I have no clue where this Factory is being passed either.\n* I don't know where Factory is being created. I don't know where Client is being created. And all these annotations are hiding all the details that I need as a debugger.\n\nThis is just a made up example.",

During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.\n\nEvery time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.\n\nBack in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.\n\nI’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.\n\nThe good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems. I’m practicing on LeetCode, trying to solve problems on my own, and I also started following the Coding Interview University roadmap. Right now, I’m working on a new project using this approach where ChatGPT only acts as a mentor instead of a code generator. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I finally feel like I’m actually learning something.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this after finishing school or a bootcamp? How did you transition from guided learning to being able to code independently? What helped you get through the feeling of being completely lost once the structure was gone?",

        "content": "This is what I understand. I kind of need some basic explanation to know where to look for things when I want to get deeper into this.\n\n  \nTCP and UDP are part of the **transport layer** in the tcp/ip stack and all layers up to that one are implemented by the **os kernel**. So my application won't have to implement it, it would use **system calls**.\n\nFor a web application a **client** and my **server** will communicate. The client will open a **tcp connection** with the correct **socket** ( ip : port 80 or 443 ) of my server. The client is e.g. the browser.\n\nSo now we have client and server with an open **tcp connection**.\n\n  \n**HTTP** is a protocol in the **application layer** in the tcp/ip stack so it has to be implemented by an application. In a nutshell, http is basically just a standard for how the string of text sent over the tcp connection is structured to be valid.\n\nThe **webserver** thats being communicated with is an application, so it implements the HTTP protocol. It can either serve static files or call programs or scripts and give the **request data** as a parameter. The application can then produce an answer. No matter if static or dynamic content is served, pretty much the webserver responds to the request it received\n\n\n\nSo that's my basic understanding at I think its correct. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here already.\n\nTLS is also an application layer protocol, so it has to be implemented by an application. I heard of libraries like OpenSSL implementing them.\n\nBut where do I **turn on HTTPS** now? Since the server has to be able to serve static content or forward requests to an application or a script, I'd guess in the server? But what if my application doesn't directly run on that server and the request will be forwarded, the server would send the decrypted regular HTTP for the rest of the path to my application.",

        "content": "So, I recently started programming again after like a year and a half of a break and I very vividly remember that every time I had a project idea that I thought was a bit too ambitious I would always put it away and I would think that it's too much for me and that I should do it some other time in the future. It wasn't until recently that I realized that that mindset can be really dumb sometimes and could even hinder your learning.\n\nNow, if you're an absolute beginner with weeks or barely 3 months of experience, then yeah start simple and work your way up. But, I'm talking about the beginners who already learned the fundamentals, those who already understand their programming language and can start making projects. Whatever it is you've been planning, just do it.\n\nBuilding projects will keep you in this loop of learning and crazy dopamine hits when you figure out how everything works. For example, right now I'm building an HTTP server with some help from a tutorial and it's something that I've always wanted to do but seemed so complex to me and now that I am doing it I feel so dumb for not starting it before because everything makes sense now, TCP packets are just a stream of bytes in order, almost no different to reading from a file and I've been reading files for months now. I would have never realized this if I had just said \"Nah, I'm not ready.\" \n\nPoint is, projects only seem impossible or difficult BEFORE you start them. When you do start them and you get through that first obstacle now the project just becomes something new but super fun. So, if you know you have the resources and the fundamental knowledge to start that one project that really interests you, just do it, don't put it off for another 3 months because you think you're not ready. You have endless learning resources, so start the project and build it by solving one problem at a time and you'll be fine.",

I come from a rural area so I quickly gave up on searching and settled elsewhere. I worked various jobs in the last 3 years. I didn't like any of them. It seems like I just can't find my place.\n\nSometimes I think about moving to the city and working as a programmer but the reality is nobody would want to hire me. I was unhirable in 2022, and it's gotten much worse since 2022.\n\nI knew getting a degree alone was not going to be enough to hired, and I knew side projects (github portfolio) and internship were important. I knew that since like 2019 or 2020 (I was still a student) but university was super overwhelming to me. I felt burnt out during university. I had no time and energy to build a portfolio.\n\nNow I have a full time job (a job that I don't like) and I am doing a weekend university that is related to my current job so I don't have much time. I will have more time when I finish this bullshit university.\n\nBut the thing is, I just do not see myself getting hired even if I code 15-20 hours every week for a year as a hobby. The market seems so oversaturated and it seems that if you don't have a cool internship coming out of university, your career is done. Also, many people are claiming that the need for developers will decrease in the near future due to AI.",

Get the paddles moving, get the ball bouncing, etc. I'm sure it'd be fun, but I'm worried that he'd see the results, and compare it with, like, AAA game titles and just be totally disappointed. How could I organize a really successful session where he's happy with what we do? Maybe something like programming a simple NPC in an RPG game or something like that? Is there any pre-made game system with programmable \"characters\"?\n\nAnother idea I had was one of these robotics kits like Lego or Vex, they both seem to support Python in addition to Scratch, but they are quite expensive -- still it's maybe an option, maybe someone can report their experience with using it for teaching?",

I even cleared cookies and cache manually, but still no result. I gave up for the day.\n\nThe next day I checked Vercel to see if I had missed something, but the deployment looked fine.

I spent the whole day reading through Fumadocs and Next.js documentation, thinking I must have forgotten some step, but I found nothing. Frustrated, I gave up and went to sleep.\n\nAt midnight, just before falling asleep, my brain suddenly remembered something. In the docs folder there is a meta.json file that maps all the docs.

And i want something that showcases skills and not a copy paste. But at the same time i don’t think i would be able to apply own logics since im new. So something about which i can get information from the web or solve my problems. Pleasee,pleaseee help me cause i have to present an idea in two weeks and start working on it afterwards.",

        "content": "Over the last few years, I’ve been teaching myself programming. I’m currently 32 and I wouldn’t say I’m “good” at any specific language. During these past few years, I’ve always jumped between multiple languages (C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, etc). I have basic knowledge in the languages listed, but I wouldn’t say enough to build something worth while.\n\nI do try and stick to one language, but then I’d usually get bored, see a new shiny thing, and jump towards that. Then most of the time, I’ll do a complete 360 and return to the language I initially started with. I’ve been doing this for years and always struggled just to stick to 1 language. And it feels like I’ve shot myself in the foot by not specialising in a single language to become efficient in it. \n\nI think the reason why I struggle focusing on a single language, is (in my honest opinion) ADHD. I haven’t been officially diagnosed with it, but a few friends who have it, have said it’s a common thing to hyper focus on something, then jump to something else (they work in tech themselves). And the other reason, is that I do find all languages interesting and want to learn as much as possible (which I know isn’t ideal when starting out).\n\nI do believe that my interests change quite a lot too, which is most likely another factor. Whether that’ll be attempting to make a small game, website, desktop app, etc. I’ve found it hard just to pick one language and run with it, ignoring the rest until I’ve built up good knowledge of different algorithms, data structures, design patterns etc.\n\nAs an example, my current job, they use C#/.NET for the backend services, and now my brain wants to learn C# again. But then I’m telling myself, “what’s the point, as you’d only focus on it for a few weeks/months, then your focus will change when a new shiny thing is discovered, or you get bored.”\n\nHas anyone else done the same in the past? If so, how did you combat it? Any advice would be appreciated.",

        "content": "Hello!\n\nI've been interning at a company for around 5 months now and I'm having a tough time honestly. I was hoping I could get some thoughts from people who've been where I have and pushed through it.\n\nWhen I started, the company made it clear that they expected nothing from me, which I found a bit strange and it made me feel like my work didn't matter from the start. I was given my first project and I completed it in a month, I told my supervisor this and his reaction seemed more annoyed than pleased, and he said he would have to find something else for me to do if I don't slow down. He also explained that I had completed it much quicker than they expected (~3/4 months ahead of schedule). This made me feel great at the time; looking back, I fear they were just underestimating me.\n\nI tried to take some initiative. I taught myself to write cleaner code, did some reading, tried to push the idea behind my first project further and add some extra features while I had no other projects or tasks lined up.\n\nI eventually asked my supervisor for some more work and he put me onto doing bug fixes. I was happy at the time because it was helping me learn much more about the codebase, about the products they sell and I was making a difference, but 3 months later and there still wasn't any more projects lined up. I spoke to a couple of my friends also away on internships and they seem to be busy, with multiple projects waiting and with deadlines. It hurts even more when I see other members of staff working on projects I feel I would me more than capable of assisting them with and when I offer to help, they turn me away.\n\nThere have been monthly stand-ups where they joke about forgetting I'm there, I haven't had a single code review in the 5 months and when I ask management, they say they've been very busy. This makes me feel even more demoralized because if they're busy, why can't they get me to help?\n\nAdditionally, I just feel like I don't deserve to be there and like I'm expendable. My manager constantly jokes about how stupid people from my university are and I do try and laugh it off but it keeps making me feel even worse about being there. I even recall cases where they've been annoyed about me asking for help!\n\nI've contemplated trying to leave in favour of another intenrship, but I don't think it's possible to find another at this time in the year and I can't imagine me leaving 8 months early would look good on my resume. I feel trapped and like I'm not improving at all.\n\nHave any of you been in an internship like this?\n\nI would appreciate all your thoughts and opinions on this as I'm really struggling. \n",

Took me about a week..... He was mind-blown when I showed him the final result 🤣🤣\nJust after that, something clicked.. I actually enjoyed doing all that. So I started learning HTML and CSS on freeCodeCamp, and honestly, I’m finding it fun and kind of addictive....\n\nNow I’m wondering if I should take this seriously and maybe change careers down the road. But I need some guidance from people who’ve been there or know the field...\n\nShould I go for frontend, backend, or full stack?\n\nWhat’s the best way to learn and practice at the same time?\n\nAny must to use resources or roadmaps for someone starting fresh plz ?\n\nAny advice or feedback would be super appreciated. 🙏",

I’m struggling with caring about them the way the system expects me to.\n\nEvery time exams approach, I don’t feel scared, anxious, or even motivated. I just feel… detached. Because my goal isn’t to chase marks — it’s to understand, to learn, to build. What excites me isn’t memorizing for a grade, it’s learning cutting, learning something that actually connects with my future.\n\nBut the problem is that sometimes, the environment around you drains you before you even start. You see people studying hard to get top marks, while you’re there trying your best to understand — but there’s nothing to truly understand. You try to find meaning in what you study, but most teachers themselves aren’t motivated, and it kills your spark a little every day.\n\nLiving in Algeria doesn’t make it easier — the system feels heavy, exhausting, and uninspiring. You go to university, follow the hours, come back home drained, and even on your “rest days,” you don’t really rest. You just survive.\n\nAnd sometimes I ask myself: do students in other countries feel the same? Are they also fighting to keep their curiosity alive in a system that wants to turn everyone into the same mold?\n\nI’m not saying I hate studying. I actually love learning. I just wish learning wasn’t reduced to chasing numbers on a piece of paper.\n\nSo yeah, I’m excited to cut — to start my own path, to learn differently, to build something that feels alive.

I enjoyed my logic design and com org courses the most so I wanted to do something useful with them.\n\nI landed on a logic design simulator that is made specifically for my uni. It will have sequential circuits , combinational, k-map solver….etc with a lecture like system and maybe an ai element in there. The issue is I am kinda lost on how to go about doing it. I am thinking about using c# with wfp or windowsForm.  But not sure if its the right move or if i should just make it on a web page. IS IT EVEN A GOOD GRADUATION PROJECT IDEA?  I know it has been done before but I cannot think of anything that has not been done before. \n\nTLDR; i want to make a logic design simulator, and want to know where should I start with something like this? Is it even worth doing?",

So let's take r/bostonceltics as a potential example.\n\nI would like to be able to tell me program to send me a notification if:\n\nThere is a new post on r/bostonceltics AND that post\n\n\\- Has the name \"Derek\" or \"Derek White\" in the title\n\n\\- Is a text post without a picture or link\n\n\\- Has 2 or fewer comments\n\n\\- Does not contain \"Brad\" or \"Brad Stevens\" in description.\n\nI would of course also like to be able to change these parameters and have multiple queries at once.\n\n  \nTo be clear, I don't want to create a bot to respond or create reddit spam--only be notified so I can then check out the post myself.\n\n\n\n**1. Is this a feasible idea in scope for a beginner to work towards?**\n\n**2. What are the likely roadblocks?**\n\n**3. What is the best programming language?**\n\nI read the subreddit FAQ and the other subreddit resources, and from what I can tell Python might be a decent choice for this, but I'd like to get some more experienced opinions before I fall down this rabbit hole.\n\nThank you so much for the help.",

My courses are completely online and asynchronous, which is great. But the resources provided are not always the greatest and expect completely green students to take in and have a full understanding of concepts that are more suited for those who have years of experience. The course is IT 315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design. I'm pretty nervous about it, as a lot of students have said it's the most difficult course they've taken throughout their studies. My understanding of programming/coding is extremely rudimentary at best, ranging from the MySpace days of editing HTML to a basic SQL class I took a few months back. That's about it. \n\nOur textbook for the course is Systems Analysis & Design: An Object-Oriented Approach with UML, 6th ed. I also just purchased a book called Head First Object Oriented Analysis & Design by Brett McLaughlin, which I have heard is great for a visual representation of the basics. Aside from actual books, does anyone have any online tutorials or videos that may be helpful for getting started here? From the very beginning of understanding the underlying concepts. The simpler, the better. I don't even know what UML is, other than that it stands for Unified Modeling Language. No idea what that means! Obviously Google will be my best friend for this class, but if anyone here has trusted resources that they've found helpful, I would definitely appreciate the guidance. TIA\n\nNote: I've already searched past threads on this and other subs for more information and resources. They weren't very helpful as most threads only had one or two replies.",

Some help with portfolio building would be the most ideal, if the course offers it.\n\nEven if its something like a graduate program, or a program that is not web development related but might be tangentially related would be great to know!

Failing every interview because bar keeps getting harder and harder. How many more interviews can I give? idk what else I can do? \n\nActual insanity, and there is high chance that I will never work as a SWE again, and Im literally back to the thinking I was at before when my life changed when I got my first job, but this time, it don't really think it will get better. \n\nGod speed everyone, this shit is wild.

        "author": "Fwellimort",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I have over the past few years tried to help 6 CS students more directly through Discord, etc. All of whom claimed to be grinding, etc and so forth. Here has been my thoughts on what I noticed of college students and new grads.\n\nPS: I have over a dozen of students who had DMed for help, etc as well but those have always been casual reddit chats since I don't care anymore.\n\n\n\nMy thoughts on the job market:\n\n1. Job market for new grads and interns this year looks significantly better than the past 2 years.\n\n2. Offshoring is a reality which cannot be ignored. Companies are growing talent abroad now and a lot of layoffs have had their jobs moved to offshore. Unlike the past, offshore infra and talent is there. Covid 'proved' remote work works and 'offshore' == 'remote work'. Talent does not magically get better or worse depending on where the individual is located. And paying top dollar in Canada means entirely different from paying dollar in US.\n\n3. There's just too many CS majors and CS curriculums overall have become easier so schools can make more money. And there's so many CS adjacent majors sprouting left and right on top like Information Science, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational X, Computer Science + X, Information Systems, Informatics, Software Engineering, Business Information Management, etc.\n\nAnd then there's the fact a lot of Math, Physics, Statistics, Actuarial Science, etc students are minoring in CS as well. And Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, etc students all applying to CS jobs as well.\n\nThe supply of candidates is essentially infinite relative to demand for new grads.\n\n4. Resumes all look similar end of day due to Chatgpt. And honestly, what can you expect out of students. These are students, not working professionals. Truth is, the most differentiating factor is school name on a resume before any work experience.\n\n  \nThat said, at the same time, the talent and quality of new grads have significantly deteriorated. The median talent is on the floor (if there even is a floor). And a lot of them seems to be due to:\n\n1. Schools dumbing down curriculums + grade inflation (easier to graduate).\n\n2. Students doing bare minimum in school and just studying for the job interviews. Hence you see students here with 2.0 GPAs showing off the interviews they have gotten.\n\n3. CS is now really mainstream unlike in the way past in which programming was thought to be for nerds.\n\n4. Modern devices have abstracted away so much that students did not have to grow up having to deal with all sorts of bugs, frustrations, etc on the Internet.\n\n5. Chatgpt. It does homework, vibe coding, etc. Why bother spending the hours?\n\n6. There is a whole industry to min-maxing CS related job interviews. And the quality is really high as well. And a lot of information which in the past might have needed weeks of research is readily available within minutes now.\n\n7. TikTok brainwashing towards the world of instant gratifications. Students just don't want to deal with long frustrating grinds that go nowhere, etc.\n\n8. A lot of students going in claim to be 'passionate' in CS but really they are just majoring in it for the money or lifestyle they heard on TikTok, Youtube, etc. Now, I think 'passionate' is cringe but .. these students are all just really doing the bare minimum.\n\n  \n\\--------\n\nWhy am I saying this? Well.. while I do know Youtube is a bait, my direct experience with 6 CS students in this subreddit have largely been the same as the ones I found on Youtube.\n\nIn fact, I would argue the ones on Youtube look like god talent relative to most of the 6 CS students here in this subreddit I interacted on Discord.\n\nWhat Youtube videos you might ask? This is from Coding Jesus Youtube channel which is extremely baity and really there for him to advertise his own site but...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0JMSFNGZmc)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM\\_3yM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6GjnVM_3yM)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s\\_ztBwg7Vls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ztBwg7Vls)\n\nLet me just say ... most of the 6 CS students in this subreddit over the years I interacted on Discord... makes those candidates look like top talent.\n\nI have come to believe that we seriously need more gatekeeping in this field. Completely agree with Coding Jesus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrboWpmD1pA)\n\n  \nOn the hiring side, most students are flat out garbage. But the problem is **student resumes despite how well done at aggregate will always look similar before actual work experience**. \n\nHence on the company side, the only way to filter is largely by school names at aggregate. And trust me when I say this, most students at \"top schools\" nowadays are flat out garbage as well. The difference being AT LEAST the students at top schools tend to be good at Leetcode. At least that bare minimum is done.\n\nThe worst part of all this is actual talent cannot be differentiated either from the rest as well. And with so much cheaters everywhere, it's just impossible to tell who is actually good from others.\n\n  \nIt has been frustrating and a huge waste of time trying to help some students here in this subreddit only to learn that they ddn't even bother to do the bare minimum. I'm sorry but if you cannot do a basic easy-medium Leetcode question and are screaming for how the world is unfair and what not claiming you have been grinding and doing everything... then you are not fit for this field. Get out.\n\nIt's been a huge waste of my time and a huge eye opening over the years how bad most CS students are lately when it comes to CS. And the best part? Every one of them at the start talked as if they thought differently of themselves.\n\n  \nBut ya.. just me rambling. Just wanted to share this. Also, good luck college students with the job market. I know it's rough. My only real advice to you is .... well, look into C++ if you are serious about software engineering and want to differentiate yourself from others. Totally agree with this recruiter as well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e4zNfyowA)\n\n\nNote: I still am helping one of them and plan to for the next few years (been helping for two years now). But no more after that. ",

Was about a 20k bump over my current role so I decided to jump in.\n\nHere’s how it went:\n\n1.) External Lead Recruiter conversation\n2.) External Business Partner conversation (direct report of #1)\n3.) Take-home assignment via Coderbyte\n4.) Discussion with CTO, including reviewing my takehome\n5.) Live leetcoding round - 2 engineers\n6.) Live system design round - 2 engineers\n7.) Behavioral interview - 1 QA engineer, 1 implementation engineer, 1 product manager\n\nAt this point, I figured I was just about done and was about to receive an offer.\n\nNo - I then received a message about them wanting me to meet their CEO for a “quick chat” - fine. As I prepare for that, I then receive another message that they just hired a new Head of Engineering and they would like me to meet with them BEFORE the CEO.\n\nInsane, right? But the market is the market so I persevere.\n\nAs I await the meeting with the Head of Engineering today, I get a call from the recruiter informing me that there was a “miscommunication” and that they will not hire in my state, NOR the one I plan to move to in a few weeks! (Florida -> Illinois) \n\nI was completely transparent about my location/relocation, with my current location being on my resume and LinkedIn (where they found me). The fact that this was not internally discussed prior to me going through the whole process is extremely inconsiderate of my and other candidates’ time.\n\nExtremely frustrating, but hey, maybe I dodged a bullet. If they are this disorganized during interviewing, it would probably be a nightmare to work for. They are also going through a re-org, after being acquired by private equity a few weeks ago.\n\nIt sucked getting the call - especially after talking to 10 people about the role - but my interview skills now are sharper.

        "content": "An IT veteran here who has lived through my share of corporate transformations and layoffs reflecting on the BIG announcement from Amazon coming just before the holidays:\n\n* The number (30,000) by itself is sizable; but there is going to be a lot more voluntary and involuntary RIFs that follow. Those may not be included in this 30K number. \n   * For example, Amazon in India may not 'layoff' people but ask them to resign (with a severance benefit). Such RIF (cloaked as 'resignation') is not reported as a layoff. \n* Amazon is just a canary in the coalmine. Other FAANG and IT services companies are following with their own RIFs - some making headlines others not \n* Analysts are pointing at reasons like AI and Automation. While there is some of it, the real reason is global slowdown. \n   * Just look at US, the largest market where Federal government shutdown is going to hit fed-workers paychecks and foodstamps too. \n   * Consumers who don't have a job can't buy stuff - offline or on Amazon\n* Offshoring and H1 - this is a big elephant in the room. Amazon has approximately 110,000 permanent employees in India across its corporate and fulfilment centres. \n   * One can assume 20-25% of such  \"corporate employees,\" especially in IT and Business Services are in India\n   * The Yin-Yang that Trump did with H1-B announcement hasn't helped matters. As of June 2025, Amazon had approximately 10,044 employees on H-1B visas, making it the largest sponsor of this visa category in the United States. Can these H1 jobs be offshored by laying off locally and hiring in India?",

I’ve owned the whole lifecycle: idea→ design → UX/UI → development → QA → bug fixes and user support.\n\nI assumed shipping a product with real users and revenue would be a strong early-career signal. So far, though, it hasn’t seemed to move the needle in early screens for internship/student/entry-level SWE roles.\n\nFor context: GPA 88/100 (\\~3.52/4). I also built a portfolio site and a product site in Next.js (not linking here).\n\n**Now for my question:** If a shipped product like this isn’t considered strong signal, what *does* count as projects or experiences that help students stand out for early-career SWE roles?

I was spending my christmas holidays as CS student trying to fix CSS issues and launch my \"unique idea\" (it kind of was but I had no idea how to monetize or grow at my 22 years).\n\nA career came relatively easy in the richer northern EU countries with plenty of corporate, slow paced jobs (cruising/rest and vest) (without really vesting anything - no stocks).\n\nLooking back I probably wasted my first 5 years of work with minor skill building in CSS. I did get pretty good in CSS though.\n\nEnter JS hype circa 2015. I Suddenly realize I was a pixel pusher / HTML-CSS guy who barely understood how jQuery worked and my JS skills were close to 0. hoisting? closures? MVVM? wtf are you talking about? I can tell you whats the difference of relative/absolute positioning and the box model, but you're not really interested are you?\n\nA lack of effort in personal projects, lack of studying the proper material, and a choice of relatively comfortable jobs that did not use Angular/Backbone or React (early days) meant I stayed behind.\n\nAround 2017 I realize I need to do something. I start grinding JS problems, non stop interviewing, codewars, and other learning platforms. I get into my first full time VueJS projects after a whiteboard recursion test and a coding challenge. Only problem: I hated the role, the product, and the people. \n\nI get into two more gigs in VueJS projects for a period of a total of 6 years in Vue. And that means: I get left out of the ReactJS game. One more thing to play catchup on.\n\nI wake up on morning and realize it's been 15 years I am coding professionally. Most of the peers I've worked with are in Lead, Senior Manager, Investor (!!) roles.\n\nI'm still doing take home code challenges, leetcode live interviews - to which I suck -, and struggling to get decent Senior SE roles.\n\nI keep interviewing, and something lands on my lap: I take over the tech of a startup without engineers. NextJS, Mongo, AWS, the whole shebang.  I m getting good at harder concepts. Do a little of AWS, deployments, backend. AI is happening, this helps. But I hate the product, and I'm working for half the salary I was making before. I get a contract at a FinTech which paid double. 3 months later I'm let go because of \"reasons\".\n\nthe job market shitshow is here. The TRUMP / Putin / War / Interest Rate bullshit all are happening. I'm trying to get jobs and interview but my age is catching up on me. My eyes are more easily tired.

A highly profitable IPO looks to be in the cards in the next few years. I have gotten refresher equity over the years, such that my TC is reasonable for 13 YOE. If they were to just 2x again on IPO, I’d be looking at a healthy 8-figure payout after taxes. But of course, that is paper money and is in no way guaranteed (though my insider knowledge has me pretty bullish). \n\nThe only two major downsides are as follows: I’ve been enduring a brutal 3 hour/day 3 day/week commute with kids at home. And two, I haven’t been able to purchase all my options. Only about 2/3. The pop in valuation coincided with having kids and I just couldn’t justify buying the options at the time, nor was I quite as bullish then. I’d need 3x more than I have in liquid savings to buy out the rest of the options due to taxes, and with every valuation pop that gets harder. I lose these unexercised options if I leave (classic golden handcuffs)\n\nI recently interviewed at a smaller, but still unicorn-level startup in the same sector. Its office is only 20 minutes away and has flexible hybrid hours. The offer is to lead a team at a >25% cash bump with a ~10% drop in equity depending on how you math some of the parameters. Overall a >15% TC upgrade at current valuations. It’s a paper career upgrade, but my biggest concern is trading out favorable pre-ISO RSU paper money where I am for paper equity in an as-of-yet less successful startup.\n\nThere’s a quality of life question that’s near and dear to my heart, but if the trade ends up being multiple 7 figures a couple years from now, I’d kick myself forever. \n\nAny of you have some advice here? Would you leave some shares on the table at a slam-dunk startup for a higher risk promotion and some QoL improvements?",

There were of course a few other languages and experience levels sprinkled in, but not that many. Fast forward to now and I have been watching indeed for a week or so. There are now over 300 listings, and filtering by entry level and full stack, there are 30 with 2 new postings today (although filtering full stack is also including jr fe and backend solely jobs as well, but hey I’ll take it). The city is not a tech hub, so there is no FAANG positions, but I’m not sure if I’d be too interested in that anyways. But, that does bring up the point that I could luckily just be in a less competitive area or something. \n\nAnyways, it’s not record breaking or anything and you can’t really determine a trend break with two data points.

        "content": "Hey everyone,  \nI really need to be honest about something that’s been bothering me.\n\nI recently finished my studies as a *state-certified Business Informatics Specialist (Software Development)*. During my time in school, I practiced programming a lot. We had structured exercises, projects, and final exams, and I did well in all of them. On paper, I should feel confident. But when it comes to building something completely on my own, I feel lost.\n\nEvery time I try to start a project, I end up asking AI for help or copying pieces of code from Google that I barely understand. I’ve vibe-coded my way through several projects that look fine on the outside, but deep down I know I didn’t really build them myself. It feels like I’ve just been stitching things together without truly understanding what’s happening. I feel like a fraud.\n\nBack in school it was easier because everything was guided and structured. Now that I’m on my own, I get overwhelmed. Everyone on LinkedIn and GitHub seems so smart and confident, creating amazing projects from scratch, while I can’t even write proper classes or use inheritance without checking examples.\n\nI’m motivated and I truly want to learn, but I keep procrastinating. I prepare everything, plan what to do, set up my environment, and then I stop. I tell myself I’ll start tomorrow. I’ve just graduated, I’m looking for a job, but honestly, I don’t know how I’d manage without AI or Google.\n\nThe good thing is that I’ve started to change how I learn. I’ve told ChatGPT not to give me direct code anymore, only to guide me and help me think through problems. I’m practicing on LeetCode, trying to solve problems on my own, and I also started following the Coding Interview University roadmap. Right now, I’m working on a new project using this approach where ChatGPT only acts as a mentor instead of a code generator. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I finally feel like I’m actually learning something.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this after finishing school or a bootcamp? How did you transition from guided learning to being able to code independently? What helped you get through the feeling of being completely lost once the structure was gone?\n\nThanks for reading. I just needed to share this somewhere where people might understand.",

Career choices, life choices, and all this affects the people around me.\n\nI'm a decent engineer. I've built stuff, I've solved problems. I know my FE shit.\n\nSince end of August I've participated in several processes, both startups and non startups. I am not in the US/UK ecosystem (S.Europe here) so I am trying to be relatively picky with my choices (I am getting less picky as we go of course).\n\nI recently was rejected after delivering a coding assignment - following two very nice (good vibes) calls with the two founders of a startup.\n\nHere is the weird part. I am pretty confident on my delivery. The assignment had a lot business detail, one had to think of what it actually needed - but thanks to AI - I delivered. Finishing touches mine, and I was prepared to answer any questions about the code. We even had a follow-up call planned to talk about the challenge.\n\n24 hours later, I receive the most generic rejection message ever - nothing about the challenge , and a cancellation of the follow-up call. I've messaged the guy who I was in touch with - and he wrote something super abstract like \"we wanted to see how you would approach the problem\" and \"we didnt see the depth we were looking for\". (honestly I dont buy it)\n\nI accidentally noticed that one of their engineers was stalking my Linkedin Profile a few hours before the rejection mail arrived. I was generally vocal about the \"AI Bubble\" and I am wondering if the fact that their business was AI-driven had something to do with it?\n\nThe other thing I am thinking is that the guy who visited my profile only did so after I spoke with the two founders so he decided for one or the other reason I am not a good fit - so they had nothing to say about the code by itself.\n\nNeedless to say this is a brutal market, and I have never seen so challenging interview processes, so lengthy filtering mechanisms. I happen to also be in a relatively small market so this might have to do with it. Remote gigs are harder to find these days.\n\nWhat the heck should I do? I am not a top 10% coder but I'm good enough for most normal businesses. I don't grind Leetcode, and I do suffer from live coding brain freeze which I am trying to battle by doing a lot of live coding interviews. But it is \\_very\\_ easy for an interviewer to find reasons to reject you.\n\nI have excellent soft skill presentation, most recruiters / HR folk are super happy with me, I present myself in an excellent manner.\n\nThe other day I was prepared to answer a specific live coding challenge following tips from the recruiter. I did it async before the call, almost memorized it.\n\nDuring live coding it, I froze because the API wasnt returning the response I was thinking it would. It took me like 5' to solve the bug.\n\nRejected",

It changed alot after consultant/private equity guys coming in, a good amount of attrition from other departments, I got met with higher expectations, I work longer hours now, I don't feel physiologically safe (which drains me alot) as mistakes can be punished and be used angainst you in performance reviews. My mistakes are weighed more than my accomplishments (eg a 'mistake' weighted would be  for merging a branch without the best optimal solution or sometimes missing a small detail  despite my co workers approving the PR)  . I love my co-workers, I dont slack. I get along with them and pair program with them  often.  I eventually got a PIP and desptie going beyond expectations. I dont think Ill make it as it got extended.  I survived many layoffs here, but I guess this is how I go.\n\nI think the positive of PIP is that it pushes you to be aware of your flaws and focus on perfecitonism, but at the same time its  burning me out lol and perfectionism is not sustainable as we are all humans. We all mistakes. Maybe its stockholm syndrome at this point.",

        "content": "I managed to get hired on as the CTO of a crude oil trading company after I was able to restore their proprietary software suite in the wake of their former sole dev bailing on the whole company. Their big CRM/ERP system went down shortly after the previous dev left, and I was fortunate enough to get the whole thing running again. So they hired me on as CTO and I was thrilled for the upgrade at the time. \n\nBut I am looking for a change of pace and want to work on new challenges in a different space altogether. I had a few interviews earlier this year and they all mentioned that they liked my resume but were worried that my actual dev skills would be diminished, as they assume because of my C-suite title that I must not be doing much actual dev work. I explained that if anything, my skills have gotten sharper, as I am still the only dev working here and have to handle the bulk of the IT issues in addition to my dev and CTO responsibilities. \n\nSo I have a few questions for you all:\n1. Would you think a CTO is not capable of proper dev work anymore?\n2. Should I be looking for Senior/Staff SWE roles or is it time to make a change to Product/Project management type of roles?\n3. Got any leads on great roles in interesting spaces?\n\n",

        "content": "Last week I came across a post from an employee at **Corgi** on LinkedIn (his job title was literally *“AI Insurance @ Corgi”*, lmao) looking for “cracked engineers.” I InMailed him sharing my interest and he replied with a calendar link to schedule a meeting before the so-called *work trial* at their office.\n\nToday I joined the meeting five minutes early to respect his time since he works at a startup and I figured that matters. Apparently they don’t think the same way. Minutes passed, no one joined. I waited for **20 minutes** and just when I was about to leave he finally joined. No apology for being late, no acknowledgment, and honestly he didn’t even seem to care about the call. He wasn’t paying attention, barely looked at me, and was probably scrolling on his phone the whole time.\n\nI had a few doubts about the startup, mainly what their *work culture* is like and what I should expect from this so-called “work trial.” When I tried to make conversation and ask about these things, he gave one-line answers and told me to email my GitHub and portfolio links (which I had already shared along with my resume a week ago). The meeting lasted barely **four minutes**.\n\nNow here’s where it gets weird:\n\n1. I couldn’t find a single solid resource about what this startup actually does or builds. Their website is just a plain landing page with almost no info.\n2. They claim to be backed by a bunch of VCs, but after checking the official portfolios of those firms, I couldn’t find *Corgi* listed anywhere except for one out of the six they mention.\n3. Their work culture looks sketchy. I saw posts where they proudly mentioned gifting mattresses to employees so they can “stay in the office 24/7.”\n\nFor a startup that floods LinkedIn with posts about hiring “engineers” (basically glorified 24/7 slaves), this entire interaction felt really off and suspicious.\n\nHas anyone else heard of or interacted with this startup? Everything about them screams red flag to me.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Hi All! Apologies for writing another one of those posts. But I am genuinely looking from some honest career advice because I feel so lost and defeated.\n\nI graduated a year ago from a T20 university. I unfortunately graduated with 0 work experience, aside from being a TA for a few semesters. I was only a CSE major my last two years of college and I couldn't land an internship in that summer between them\n\nRecently, I had an interview for an internship position for a large company that I was able to secure through a referral. Shortly after the interview, one of the engineers on the panel told me that they want to move forward with me but that I should hold tight for the official offer letter for a couple weeks as they are amidst a hiring freeze. I felt a huge sense of relief and excitement that I was finally going to land a position after months of despair. Fast forward a month later, I get an email from the recruiter that the position is no longer being filled. Needless to say, I felt absolutely crushed.\n\nThis is especially demoralizing because I have never been this close to landing a position as I rarely get interviews. I get rejected or ghosted for pretty much every application I send out. I feel like recruiters are avoiding me like the plague. I suspect it is because they are prioritizing this year's batch of new grads for junior positions. This is making me feel like my window to get my foot in the door has closed.\n\nI have even applied to some IT, QA, and analyst positions but it seems like even those are hard to get these days, especially without certs. I have also been searching for internships but finding one that is also open to grads is extremely rare.\n\nAside from applying, I have been LeetCoding, building projects, and filling in knowledge gaps using things like The Odin Project to learn full-stack development skills. I also recently finished a volunteering gig as a \"web developer\" but all I did was help build a site using a low-code website builder.\n\nI am getting the feeling that my family is getting tired of me freeloading, and I am running out of cash. So I am now trying to reassess my options and I am hoping to get some advice/anecdotes from people on here.\n\nWay I see it, I have the following options:\n\n1. Continue on the job search grind. But until when? I am running on fumes and I am getting very depressed from doing this, with little results to show. Maybe focus on non-SWE IT and analyst roles, but again finding a truly entry-level position that doesn’t require certs or experience is pretty rare.\n2. Go get a master's degree in CS. The ROI on this one is not clear at the moment and I am already in a decent amount of student debt from undergrad. But this does reset the clock and make me eligible for an internships again, and I will work really fucking hard to secure one. However, I am worried about my prospects, since I had a so and so GPA (3.4) and no research or work experience. I am also currently broke so funding the degree will be difficult, especially without all the recent funding cuts.\n3. Apply to the military as an officer. Stable employment but I still have to get in and I hear it's challenging for those outside of the military. Besides, this is not a very appealing option due to recent events and I will most likely not be doing any software engineering.\n4. Look for a non-tech job. I know that this will challenging as other job markets are also struggling. It hurts me to think that all my hard work on my CS degree will mean nothing and it feels like once I accept a non-tech related position, my chances of making it into this industry will officially become 0. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading my post\n\nP.S. my resume can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/C3MpeyT) if anyone is curious.",

The constant stress at work has drained me to the point where I feel like I have no motivation left.\n\nI’m leading a project right now, and it’s been rough. The environment is cutthroat, deadlines are unrealistic, and the infrastructure we depend on is poor. My manager is honestly quite incompetent there’s no real support or guidance. Most of the people I’m working with have been struggling too, and aside from a couple of reliable teammates, I’ve had to pick up the slack for others just to keep the project moving.\n\nI’ve been fighting to unblock issues every single day, often taking on extra work to make sure we don’t fall behind. But now we’ve hit a problem , I missed some edge cases earlier in the design, and we might need to pivot to a new design for a small part of the project just a week before launch. I fully accept my mistake, but I can’t stop worrying about how this will reflect on me. With deadlines approaching, I’m terrified this will affect my performance review or even put me on a PIP.\n\nWhat’s making it worse is the exhaustion. I’ve spent so much energy fixing things that were never really my fault in the first place, finding workarounds, reviewers nitpicking and getting alignments, and now that I’m facing my own blocker, I just don’t have the will to deal with it. It feels like I’ve been holding this project together while slowly falling apart myself.\n\nI’m not sure what to do at this point, part of me wants to keep pushing, but another part just wants to stop caring altogether. Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you handle it when you were stuck between burnout, guilt, and fear of being penalized?",

I own all of the data processing done for my team, and recently we had a huge break (about 1/3rd of all of our data is not being processed). My manager is angry as he needs this data immediately for a report he has to give to his higher ups. Fine, i’m working on it and will try to have a fix. I do an investigation and by Friday I have an answer as to what happened, but turns out I was wrong as to what the issue was. My manager gets angry and implies Ill have to work over the weekend as the data is needed urgently. I do work over the weekend and successfully get the data ingested, but the pipeline is still broken. He’s furious at this point as its still not working, and proceeds to go through the entire stack and point out every thing that is wrong/missing to me in a long teams post.\n\nI proceed to skip lunch and spend even more time working on it, and give him an answer to what im doing, but he’s not satisfied. He’s been pinging me multiple times a day and after hours asking about my progress and doing investigations on my behalf (not to help, but to message me more about what I need to fix). \n\nI’ve been stressed like hell, mostly because of a lot of personal stuff going on currently+doing grad school at the same time+ trying to gtfo. I wish I could tell him that I understand Im making some really dumb mistakes, but life is not in my favor right now and it would be a lot better if we worked as partners and not as adversaries, but something tells me that would make him even angrier. Its even worse because im vying for SWE II and he will have a big say in whether or not I get promoted.\n\nIf someone could please give me guidance on what to do besides keeping my head down and continuing to work, I would really appreciate it.",

I'm super early in my job search, so I know it might just take time to hear back from some companies.\n\nWhen I was laid off, I was trying to conceive with my husband for a couple of months, so this was a really bad time for me to lose my job. \n\nI have 3.5 years of experience working with mostly Vue and TypeScript. I did learn React at bootcamp and have been diving back into studying it since I know it's in higher demand. The thing is, I don't think I can mentally handle the grind in this field. When I first started out, I was hungry, driven, ambitious, and excited to code. I was extremely lucky to land a job 2 months after graduating from bootcamp, and tech was a lot easier to break into. \n\nNow I'm in my 30s, I want kids, and I don't have as much motivation to hustle.\n\nAs much as I love coding, I don't love the concept of having to grind constantly when I want to focus on family building and family life. Just the process of getting through dev interviews feels insane right now. Grinding leetcode, memorizing a ton of system design questions, doing tons of projects to practice different technologies, going through several rounds of interviews, only to possibly get rejected at the last stage? And then maybe having to do it ALL over again if you get laid off a year or 2 later? \n\nI've been studying my ass off the past few weeks and it got me thinking, if I'm finding this super exhausting now with no kids, how the hell am I gonna do this again if I were to get laid off again with a toddler or 2? Yes I would of course have support from my husband, but I don't know if it's realistic for me personally to constantly be trying to hustle at work, hustle while being laid off, and be a parent to young children. \n\nI keep seeing posts from people who have been laid off multiple times in a year and the idea of having to go through the  interview process more than once in a year sounds horrible. Plus, I SUCK at leetcode. I'm a great dev, but leetcode has always been a weakness of mine.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas of where I could pivot in tech? I want to learn more about roles that don't require such stressful interview processes.  Thank you in advance.",

I don't really have motivation to try to make a banking website or something like that, because I know it isn't real so it will never have any real purpose and companies will see it as not fulfilling its purpose so it doesn't count?

The problem is, I’m the only truly experienced frontend person here. My team members, while good people, are generally junior or mid-level, and honestly, they often just want to get tasks done with minimal effort.\n * Code Quality: The code I review is frequently poor—written just to pass the ticket, not to be clean or maintainable.\n * Stagnation Fear: When I do code reviews, I often worry that I'm not just failing to grow, but actually regressing. I have no one more experienced than me in frontend to learn from, which makes me feel professionally trapped.\n * The Dilemma: My role is to mentor them (which I try to do through detailed code reviews and discussions), but constantly dealing with low-quality code makes me paranoid that I'm absorbing bad habits myself.\nThe Challenge\nI need advice on how to combat this feeling of stagnation and ensure I keep growing my skills (especially technical ones like architecture and modern patterns).\nCrucially, I have very little time outside of work for side projects or intense studying. I need strategies to develop myself during work hours within the confines of my current role and project.\nMy Questions for the Community\n * In-Job Development: What are the most effective ways for a senior/lead to force their own growth technically when surrounded by less-experienced developers, especially when time after work is scarce? (e.g., specific code review tactics, using project architecture as a growth tool, etc.)\n * Market Strategy: Given the competitive nature of the current tech job market (layoffs, high competition for senior roles):\n   * When is the right time to leave? Should I wait until I can find a role that guarantees working with better talent?\n   * How do I best position my current leadership role (leading a small team, improving code quality) for interviews at top-tier companies that value deep technical expertise?\n * Mindset: How do you mentally cope with being the \"only source of truth\" and avoid the burnout/frustration that comes from constantly correcting fundamental issues?\nThanks in advance for any insights on maintaining momentum and making a strategic career move!\n",

        "content": "SDE2 of 7 YoE. I've been reorg'd to my current team 1.5 years ago, and it's been a nightmare. I'm not interested in my team's product, state of engineering wants to pull your hair out, and my manager is borderline toxic. WLB is great and I love my people (outside of my manager), but I've felt incredibly stagnant in my career for awhile and feel miserable. I've been on a burnout for months that's been gradually increasing, and I know that things won't significantly improve anytime soon. \n\nI've originally planned to find a position within the company to transfer internally, and it's been 3 months since I started browsing around. Now, it feels like I might be better off to take a full plunge and prep for interviewing other companies for few reasons:\n\n1. I've been having golden handcuff, but my salary is tanking hard in less than a year once my 4 year RSU runs out. At that point, I'm only losing a modest amount of salary to jump ship to other company's SDE2 position (according to levels.fyi). That's not even considering a slim chance that I make the hiring bar for senior in some companies. There is no path for promotion within my current company for awhile, anyways. I've saved enough to last for awhile.\n2. Due to the company policy, it's practically impossible for me to transfer internally for another half a year without painting myself a target. Honestly unsure if my mental health will remain sane until then.\n3. I've been on GC process for a bit (completed I-140 w/ EB3 using TN). Given the state of current administration, it's very unlikely that mine will be processed in a reasonable time. Might as well keep the priority date and resume as EB-2 at another company.\n4. Tied to GC process above, I can only internally transfer to positions within my city. I'm on a branch office away from HQ, and the options are pretty small. I don't have much things to bind me to the city outside of GC process, and am honestly okay relocating.\n5. I've been border locked for the entire year, and will continue to be so until GC is approved - immigration attorney strongly advises not to travel internationally. Not only does changing company mostly address that risk (since I'll have to restart with PERM), it gives me an option to get a sizeable amount of vacation in-between jobs. I've been dying to travel abroad again, albeit this is not a big reason to sabotage anything on my job.\n\n  \nI'm leaving the team in the earliest opportunity for sure. I just need to choose between finding an internal position within my current city and company, or fully commit to searching outside. I've heard many anecdotes of how terrible the job market is now, how insane the hiring bars are. The uncertainty with recession also adds a risk of layoffs, which tends to target less contributing employees including new hires.\n\nAm I crazy to consider jumping ship in this market?",

        "author": "GreatestJakeEVR",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Before I explain what's going on let me start by saying my brother is probably the least greedy, most trustworthy person on this planet. So I'm not worried that he'll try to screw me over, its that I don't have any idea what would be a fair way to charge for something of this nature since it'll basically be entirely my creation from the ground up that is using the data he is supplying. So general advice on books to read or websites to go for advice on the best practices for deciding the monetary value of certain work or current industry practices for different types of work would also be welcome.\n\n# So here's what's happening:\n\nMy brother has an idea for a service he wants to offer to the clients in his day job. Basically its a really confusing field and he wants to charge subscription access to his clients for a website that basically presents all this data for the client in plain English. This is a big deal because there are TONS of these JSON collections of rules and trust me, trying to figure it out from badly named JSON files with confusingly named key : value pairs is insanity. Presumably this info must have existed at one point, but that's kind of the thing: the whole system is so big and convoluted and there's no easily accessible source of info about it.\n\nThe reason he contacted me is cuz he wants a program that can take these complicated collections of rules and make sense of them then put them on the internet somewhere so people can access a plain English description of the interactions and uses of them. \n\n# What's the issue?\n\nThe issue is that I have a crazy amount of extremely varied experience I have that is allowing me to work on this solo and make something that will actually be a decent software. I've been so interested in data science and ML that I went back for my second bachelor's degree because of it I was certified in TensorFlow years ago, and have been using ChatGPT since before it was the the all-accessible great-god-genie that it is today. You used to have to apply for it by submitting how you planned to use it back when it was still in its infant stages.\n\nAnyway its a ton of school,, internship, job, and hobby work that I've done that's put me in a position where I know I can solo build this entire thing for sure.  I've already created a model that \"seems\" to be able to pull this off. (I have no idea if its correct cuz its not my field, but my bro says the ones I showed him appear to be mostly correct. Obviously its gonna take a good bit of fine tuning, but I'm not worried in the least that this is going to work out.)\n\nSo basically I'm going to be 100% making all the decisions of how to design and code and use the models, code and organize all the data collection and storage on the backend, and code all the website design, and do the hosting, testing, CI/CD etc. Every bit of the software that powers this whole endeavor is going to be made by me.\n\n# So what the F'ing F  is fair for me to ask for as compensation?\n\nI don't like the idea of just charging an hourly wage and having to give up something that is all my work. But also I have no intentions or desire to screw my brother on this either. I'm only getting this opportunity cuz he knows me and has the insight to know this is something that his clients would be very happy to have.\n\nAlso the amount of hours I'll put in is not equal to the amount of work that I'm  getting done. A lot of the work is going to be done in the background as my software goes through all this data and creates useful output that's then organized in a way that it can all be dumped in a database and easily retrieved through a site made with Django.\n\nOh and there's multiple clients each with their own sets of rules and things so finding a way to make my database schema universal (or as close to universal as possible) between clients is going to go a long way to prevent me from having to hardcode all of these for each client by hand. \n\nThe idea is if he picks up another client, we can just dump the data to my system and it will parse it, decode it, and add it all to the database (and through the magic of Django, create a whole bunch of webpages using that data that don't have to be coded by hand).\n\nSo please, if you have experience working on anything like this or working for a company deciding what to charge clients or know any ways I could learn about that I could really use the info.\n\nI've always worked for someone else at an hourly wage, so I have no idea how what to do otherwise. I just don't feel like being paid an hourly wage to work on this is fair. And I'd have no idea how to even figure out how much of a percentage to ask for if I want to split the profits from the subscription sales.",

A little background is I was enlisted for 6 years, got my bachelors in business then transitioned out into a BDR role. That company was a mess but I was recruited via linkedin to do back-end work for our sales team at a data center.   \n  \nFirst year was great! Networked well and learned a lot, then our teams got split into specific roles for different tasks. During this time I was asking heavily for SOP's since we already didn't have many and our scope of work was actually still expanding since data centers are booming with AI. Was promised some but never happened.\n\nGot a new manager that's been there for years and shes buddy buddy with our boss. Thought I was doing great, been on the team for almost a year and started showing a lot of improvement in July until now. 1 on 1s were shorter. Got some feedback on things I needed to correct but it was happening less and less. Out of the blue I get hit with this PIP last week. Still dont have SOP's but told im making too many mistakes. I currently have the second most cases managed but told my \"numbers are low\". No proof of the numbers and no verified measure of success for our team.   \n  \nHR asks me not to record the PIP but I did on my phone for my defense. I show all the improvement and the fact I do just as much as everyone else (its really not that intensive of a job we only get a few cases a week and I try to grab my fair share). But even with all my proof and documentation, the 8 mistakes I've made in the last few months apparently warrant a PIP (same mistakes my team members have and STILL are making currently). Manager is now OOO but pip gives vague KPI's which amount to \"make less mistakes and do more work\". No numbers no percentages just \"do better\".\n\nI know holidays are a terrible time to job search and I feel like linkedin doesn't even work anymore. I'm really nervous for what I'm going to do here. Any advice is appreciated.\n\n\\[Side note\\]  \n\\- I'm the only guy on my team  \n\\- I've documented a lot of the short comings of other teams and our systems (Ex: SOP's not having been updated since 2023, multi day delays in replies)  \n\\- Old manager says somebody on their team got hired that they want to throw out but they cant and his bosses boss came down on everyone hard about being able to get rid of people. Timelines line up on when I started getting monitored super closely so might have something to do with it.",

I didn't want to be a bad employee so I left. He didn't even care. \n* Got an offer in 2 weeks for a total of 7% less yearly compensation of my previous role and NOTE for a fintech company.\n* I was expecting a 2-times per year salary re-negotiation but policy changed.\n* I got a 2,26% salary increase last January.\n* I was promised a better raise this year.\n* I worked my ass off to evolve more. Almost finished my MSc in CS.\n* I accepted to talk about a new offer ONCE and without even trying they accessed my skill was worth a 25% increase in salary and a seniority role - I get to mentor entry/juniors.\n* It is 100% better choice for me to leave, but feeling remorse cause my current team which are great people will get destroyed.\n\n  \nSome more notes for the company:\n\n1. Year closed with 50% profit increase.\n2. New offices in new city\n3. New AI team and hired like 20 ( I am assuming expensive ) AI engineers over they year.\n4. Developer left team in January, I got his workload - no salary increase, never got a replacement.\n5. Team got 3 new projects in September.\n6. Core developer was owed 200 hours of overtime and eventually instead of paying they gave him a 4 day work week for the next few months..... SAD?\n\nSUMMARY;   \nΤo me it feels like in this company my worth is less and it gets depicted in salary.   \nCompany will try to match offer only because they are in dire position.  I don't think this much of a raise would be ever considered.  \nThis means they don't value me as they should or my worth is less here and I will be better of switching anyway.  \nThe new company is purely software development oriented vs current FINTECH.",

Some of these definitely annoyed or upset me on the day, but I don’t think about them on a regular basis. The point is— should I have been upset or annoyed at all?\n\nThere’s been a few instances over the past 5 years where I stayed up at night thinking of people’s actions and comments. I feel like nearly all of the comments and actions were justified, so I think I’m just too emotional and sensitive. I shared some of these with friends, and they all say I’m not being too sensitive, but I also almost never hear them complaining about anything like this (their complaints are usually of the shape “my managers putting me on a dead end project” or “my manager is not acknowledging my contributions”)\n\nCurious how people would react in any of the circumstances:\n\n* When I was a junior with 2 yoe, I wrote a cl and sent it to someone I’ve been working with, and he scheduled a 1:1 to talk about it. During the meeting, he gave some helpful (but maybe controversial? My tl didn’t agree with the final shape of the cl) advice, but at the same time he was laughing at my code and asking why I did this, and that Im surely smarter than him because I graduated from Caltech. I think I didn’t have a good reason beside it made sense to me. \n\n\n* I switched companies after just over 2.5 years. After about 10 months , my manager told me that my growth trajectory isn’t as good as <new grad who started 3 month after me>, and that I’d benefit from more local mentorship (the brain of the project is in hongkong, as was my manager. I’m based in the us)\n\n\n* A manager some levels above me mentioned that he’d rather work with smart assholes than people who are nice but slightly incompetent. (Though to be clear, we’re not hiring either)\n\n\n* My manager is also an IC (he only manages me), and he was the main reviewer for a cl I worked on. Another coworker left a comment and I tried to talk to my manager about these comments first. He cut me off both times. The first time was me saying oh “triggers are a good idea”, and he replied. “Yeah yeah, I saw his comment”. The second time was “are you available at 2:30? I…” “I have a meeting then”. I ask dumb questions so it’s pretty normal to get cut off, but what really annoyed me was securing our 1:1 the next day, he ask what triggers are.\n(I told this interaction to another younger coworker, and his response was I shouldn’t be emotional at work and that I should talk to my manager, which I did do weeks ago.)\n",

        "content": "Hey,\n\nI graduated from an OK university in Europe with a 3.1 GPA, so not good but not bad either. However, as I have started applying for jobs and from reading discussions on CS related forums (such as here), I have started feeling like a complete fraud. I feel like I know a little bit about a lot, but when I read posts on here I'm seeing terms I have never in my life seen before, and they are thrown around as if it were common knowledge.\n\nI feel like my lack of real skills is making it impossible for me to find a junior position; recruiters look at my CV and just discard it because there is nothing about it that stands out in any positive ways.\n\nBut I do *love* CS and programming, so I'm committed to making this work somehow. I think I need to seriously improve on my core CS skills, but also programming skills, probably by going deep on some specific stack or framework.\n\nBut man, I have *no clue* where to begin. It feels as if there is an ocean of things that I need to learn before I can even be considered as a serious junior candidate. I dont even know where to begin. I'm currently learning more about infrastructure (self-hosting really) by developing some fairly basic LLM wrappers to make job searching and application easier, and so I'm learning about hosting apps via Docker on remote servers, as well as setting up proper CI/CD pipelines. But even then, this is a miniscule thing and—I dont think—of any interest to any employers. There's also the AI BS, making it feel mega inefficient to do anything by hand (and actually trying to learn), as opposed to just vibing some slop out.\n\nI dont know, what do I even do? I'm thinking of doing my masters in CS come next year if I cant find anything, but I dont really have any particular interest in CS research and it would just amount to kicking the can down the road. I'm also fine like really doubling down on trying to improve core CS skills if that is what's missing to get a job, but I dont think an employer gives a damn about me knowing my DS&As.\n\nWhat do I do?",

However, on my joining day, I was moved to a different team, not the one that was pitched to me while interviewing. I didn't find the new team that interesting, but I told myself I'll give it 3 months before judging. We just did the planning for the next 2 quarters, and I find it really boring. I brought this up to my manager on day 1 that I found the other team more interesting, but nothing has been done about it. \n\nI have an opportunity to join an old colleague's team in a different big tech company, and that sounds like a very exciting opportunity. I'm just worried what it'll look like to future employers if I leave this company within 3-4 months. Right now I'm feeling very demotivated about the work, and that's impacting my performance, I'm not able to meet deadlines but I find myself unable to even motivate myself to do anything beyond the bare minimum.

        "content": "I'm really at a loss for what to do when it comes to discussing my past experience in interviews. I recently failed to pass final rounds for a couple companies, the one I got feedback from they told me I \"didn't have the complexity or scope\" in my prior roles that the hiring manager was looking for. This is something I was afraid of going in to the behavioral interviews. I have about 2.5 years of total experience, with a little over 2 at Amazon and 6 mo. on a consulting project (which was a wash because I had to take a personal leave for most of it). I didn't get a chance to show much initiative at Amazon, and the projects assigned to me were small in scope, usually solitary, and not all that technically complex. I have found ways to force them to fit a handful of scenarios, but I just don't have enough content to cover all the possible questions. On top of that it's been so long that I can't remember enough detail about my work or team interactions when an interviewer drills down on a project/topic (in retrospect I should have kept a work diary for reference). I end up having to improvise, which always goes poorly and I feel like I'm coming off as a fraud. What should I do for behavioral interviews going forward? Should I just admit to interviewers that I haven't gotten to do much and want a chance to prove myself? Make up embellishments to my experience? Find a new career? I've been unemployed searching for over a year to no avail so any advice on this would be appreciated.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "I've been working at my company for almost 10 years, and I'm a senior in a role that's a mix of Product Owner and Developer. The thing is, my seniority in this role is more due to my time working in support and consulting, where I worked for 6 years with the product before moving to my current position. I only started programming about 3 years ago, without a degree in the field, and dividing my time with the PO part of the job.\n\nI wanted to experience a full-time developer position in a larger scope than my current one, and I started sending out resumes for internal positions. Incredibly, I got an offer for a senior developer position for a completely different product within the same company, in an industry I have zero knowledge of. I applied for other mid-level positions, but this was the first one I received an offer for.\n\nThe selection process was easy and quick, and I think the people didn't realize that my actual developer experience is quite short. I think they saw I had a senior tier and skipped technical questions about the stack and previous technical experiences, focusing instead on behavior and logic.\n\nI know it will sound like imposter syndrome, but sometimes it's not just a syndrome, right? I'm terrified of accepting the position and ending up fired if I can't deliver what they ask for in the first few months. Financially, I should receive about a 30% increase if I accept.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation or knows of stories of similar situations? I usually learn quickly, but I know that seniority in development isn't earned overnight. I'm even considering scheduling a meeting with the manager to explain the situation and try to align expectations, possibly reducing the seniority/salary initially to reduce the risk of dismissal, but I know that might seem like a red flag to the manager. My company had layoffs this year, and this new team's department recently suffered one.\n\nThanks everyone! Sorry for the long text.",
