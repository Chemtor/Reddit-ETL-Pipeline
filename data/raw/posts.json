Our data model is too large to fit entirely into power bi memory, even with vertipaq compression and 400gb of memory. \n\nFor reference, we are somewhere between 750gb-1tb depending on compression. \n\nThe solution to this point is direct query on an XL SQL warehouse which is essentially running nonstop due to the SLAs we have. This is costing a fortune. \n\nSolutions thought of:\n- Pre aggregation: great in thought, unfortunately too many possibilities to pre calculate \n\n- Onelake: Microsoft of course suggested this to our leadership, and though this does enable fitting the data ‘in memory’, it would be expensive as well, and I personally don’t think power bi is designed for drill downs\n\n- Clickhouse: this seems like it might be better designed for the task at hand, and can still be integrated into power bi. Columnar, with some heavy optimizations. Open source is a plus. \n\nAlso considered: Druid, SSAS (concerned about long term support plus other things)\n\nIm not sure if I’m falling for marketing with Clickhouse or if it really would make the most sense here. What am I missing? \n\nEDIT: i appreciate the thoughts this far. The theme of responses has been to pushback or change process. I’m not saying that won’t end up being the answer, but I would like to have all my ducks in a row and understand all the technical options before I go forward to leadership on this. ",

I’ve been working on this project on-and-off for a while, and I thought I would see what [r/DE](https://www.reddit.com/r/DE/) thinks.\n\nThe basics of the pipeline are as follows, orchestrated with Airflow:\n\n1. Download and extract bill data from [Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/) bulk data page, unzip it in my local environment (Google Compute VM in prod) and concatenate into a few files for easier upload to GCS. Obviously not scalable for bigger data, but seems to work OK here\n2. Extract url of voting results listed in each bill record, download voting results from url, convert from xml to json and upload to GCS\n3. In parallel, extract member data from [Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/) API, concatenate, upload to GCS\n4. Create external tables with airflow operator then staging and dim/fact tables with dbt\n5. Finally, export aggregated views (gold layer if you will) to a schema that feeds a Streamlit app.\n\nA few observations / questions that came to mind:\n\n\\- To create an external table in BigQuery for each data type, I have to define a consistent schema for each type. This was somewhat of a trial-and-error process to understand how to organize the schema in a way that worked for all records. Not to mention instances when incoming data had a slightly different schema than the existing data. Is there a way that I could have improved this process?\n\n\\- In general, is my DAG too bloated? Would it be best practice to separate my different data sources (members, bills, votes) into different DAGs?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/153iiz683llf1.png?width=2158&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e735c54db6bf536fa52d7f8e4fa246feb62f7b\n\n\\- I probably over-engineered aspects of this project. For example, I’m not sure I need an IaC tool. I also could have likely skipped the external tables and gone straight to a staging table for each data type. The Streamlit app is definitely high latency, but seems to work OK once the data is loaded. Probably not the best for this use case, but I wanted to practice Streamlit because it’s applicable to my day job.\n\nThank you if you’ve made it this far. There are definitely lots of other minor things that I could ask about, but I’ve tried to keep it to the biggest point in this post. I appreciate any feedback!",

My passion lies in data and AI, not necessarily in core engineering or people management. My background leans more toward the “type B” data engineer, I have an analytical, business-focused mindset and a love for working with data, rather than being deep into systems or heavy software engineering.\n\nLately, I’ve been considering a few possible paths:\n\n* Pivoting into product management for data/AI products\n* Transitioning into AI engineering and building more ML-focused skill sets\n* Becoming a more well-rounded data engineer by leaning into software engineering skills\n* Or perhaps focusing on strategy and leadership roles where I can influence how businesses create value with data rather than being hands-on with execution.\n\nUltimately, I know I want to become a leader in data or AI in 5 years issh (head of data, director of AI team), someone shaping direction and strategy rather than just pipelines, but I’m still unclear on what the right stepping stones are to get there.\n\nIf anyone has been through a similar crossroads, or has insights on the best ways to transition toward more strategic, data-driven leadership roles, I’d really appreciate your thoughts.\n\nThanks in advance!",

This approach works, but it’s error-prone — for example, manual updates or overlooked changes sometimes don’t update these columns, causing data to be missed in our loads.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many streaming CDC solutions (Debezium, Kafka Connect, AWS DMS) that consume binlogs, but they feel overkill for small teams and require substantial operational overhead.\n\nThis leads me to wonder: why isn’t there a **more lightweight, batch-oriented binlog reader and parser** that could be used for incremental processing? Are there any existing tools or libraries that support this use case that I might be missing?

These are not always just whatever is from the source data, it can start to be things like joining different data sources together to create more complex stuff, but they are generally not report specific (you can create whatever reports off of them).\n4.

This is usually something like aggregated, unioned, denormalized datasets.\n\nOverall folder structure might be something like this:\n\n* raw\n   * source\\_A\n   * source\\_B\n* staging\n   * source\\_A\n   * source\\_B\n   * intermediate\n* catalog\n   * business\\_domain\\_1\n   * business\\_domain\\_2\n   * intermediate\n* reporting\n   * report\\_X\n   * report\\_Y\n   * intermediate\n\nHistorically, the raw layer above was our staging layer, the staging layer above was an intermediate layer, and all intermediate steps were done in the same intermediate folder, which I feel has become unnecessarily tangled as we've scaled up.",

        "content": "**Background:** At RudderStack, I had been successfully using Postgres for the event streaming use case, scaled to 100k events/sec [thanks to these optimizations](https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/scaling-postgres-queue/). Nevertheless, I continue to further explore opportunities to optimize. So I and my team started experimenting with Pulsar (only for the parts of our system - data ingestion specifically). We experimented with Apache Pulsar for ingesting data vs having dedicated Postgres databases per customer (one customer can have 1+ Postgres databases, they would be all master nodes with no ability to share data which would need to be manually migrated each time a scaling operation happens).\n\nNow that it's been quite some time using Pulsar, I feel that I can share some notes about my experience in replacing postgres-based streaming solutions with Pulsar and hopefully learn from your opinions/insights.\n\n### What I liked about Pulsar:\n\n* **Tenant isolation is solid, auto load balancing works well:** We haven't experienced so far a chatty tenant affecting others. We use the same cluster to ingest the data of all our customers (per region, one in US, one in EU). MultiTenancy along with cluster auto-scaling allowed us to contain costs.\n* **No more single points of failure (data replicated across bookies):** Data is replicated in at least two bookies now. This made us a lot more reliable when it comes to data loss.\n* **Maintenance is easier:** No single master constraint anymore, this simplified a lot of the infra maintenance (imagine having to move a Postgres pod into a different EC2 node, it could lead to downtime).\n\n### What's painful about Pulsar:\n\n* **StreamNative licensing costs** were significant\n* **Network costs** considerably increased with multi-AZ + replication\n* **Learning curve** was steeper than expected, also it was more complex to debug\n\nWould love to hear your experience with Postgres/Pulsar, any opinions or insights on the approach/challenges. \n\nP.S. I am a strong believer in keeping things simple, using the trusted and reliable tools over running after the most shiny tools. At the same time, one should be open to actively experiment with new tools, evaluating them for your use case (with a strong focus on performance/cost). I hope this dialogue helps others in the community as a learning opportunity to evaluate technologies, feel free to ask me anything.\n",

Features like materialized view or aggregating mergetrees seems also super interesting to us.\n\nWe have made the decision to incluse CH into our infrastructure, knowing that it's gonna be a key part for BI mostly (metrics coming from sensors mostly, with quite a lot of functional logic with time windows or contexts and so on).\n\nThe question is: how do we host this?\nThere isnt a single chance I can convince my boss to use a managed service, so we will use resources from a cloud provider.\n\nWhat are you experiences with self-hosted CH? Would you recommend a replicated infrastructure with multiple containers based on docker-compose ? Do you think kubernetes is a good idea?\nAlso, if there are some downsides or drawbacks to clickhouse we should consider I am definitely up for some feedbacks on it!\n\n[Edit] our data volume is currently about 30GB/day, using Clickhouse it goes down to ~1GB/day\n\nThank you very much!",

This consists of techs like kafka, snowpipe streaming for real time ingestion and also snowpipe/copy jobs for batch processing of files from AWS S3 and then Streams, Tasks, snowflake Dynamic tables for tramsformation. The snowflake account have multiple databases and in that multiple schemas exists but we only want to have the DR configuration done for critical schemas/tables and not full database.\n\nMajority of the component hosted on the AWS cloud infrastructure. However, as mentioned this has also spanned across components which are lying outside the Snowflake like e.g kafka, Airflow scheduler etc. But also within snowflake we have warehouses , roles, stages which are in the same account but are not bound to a schema or database. And how these different components would be in synch during a DR exercise making sure no dataloss/corruption or if any failure/pause in the halfway in the data pipeline?

We can ask for more storage via IT tickets, add compression and look into partitioning for performance. But none of those will really solve the issue in the long term.\n\nI’m wondering a couple of different things here:\n\n1) Does something like Hadoop need to be considered? Is a sql rdms the best opinion for data of this size on-prem?\n\n2) What learning resources to you recommend for understanding how to navigate this kind of thing? The all knowing gpt keeps suggesting designing data intensive applications and the data warehouse toolkit, both of which I have and neither really touches on this.\n\nAnyway, thanks to any on-prem homies who know the struggle and have advice.",

Since I'm coming from a CS undergrad, I know that personal projects are key for actually expanding beyond what's done in coursework to show my skills. But I'm having trouble coming up with something.\n\n I've wanted to do something related to analyzing data from Steam, and I have dabbled a bit already into learning how to get Steam data via scraping/APIs. I've also been taking note of tools people mention here to know what I want to use during the project. SQL is a given, as is Python. And AWS, as I already have access to a well-regarded course for it(from some time ago when I was panicking trying to learn everything, figured I may as well make that the cloud platform to learn if I already have a course on it). \n\n  \nMy issue mainly is I want to keep this on a scale that won't make me overwhelm myself too fast. Again, I'm new to this, and so I want to approach this in a way that's going to mainly help me in learning more and then showing what I've learned on my portfolio.  So any tips on how to come up with a project for this would be appreciated, and thank you for reading this!",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I've been working on a data pipeline to update AI agents and RAG applications’ knowledge base in real time.\n\nCurrently, most knowledgeable base enrichment is batch based . That means your Pinecone index lags behind—new events, chats, or documents aren’t searchable until the next sync. For live systems (support bots, background agents), this delay hurts.\n\nTo solve this I've developed a streaming pipeline that takes data directly from Kafka, generates embeddings on the fly, and upserts them into Pinecone continuously. With Kafka to pinecone template , you can plug in your Kafka topic and have Pinecone index updated with fresh data. \n\n- Agents and RAG apps respond with the latest context\u000b \n- Recommendations systems adapt instantly to new user activity\n\nCheck out how you can run the data pipeline with minimal configuration and would like to know your thoughts and feedback.

On the upside, the startup role looks exciting since I’d have the chance to build the data platform from the ground up, get hands-on with AI agents development, and manage customer facing initiatives.\n\nThe move would also mean relocating from the East Coast to the West Coast and buying a car, longer hours and more stress.\n\nWould you stick with the big firm or take the leap for the startup?",

Overall, my role feels pretty frustrating:\n\n-There’s constant context switching between small urgent ad-hoc requests. The problem is that everything is urgent so it’s impossible to prioritize.\n\n-A lot of these requests is just manual crap that no one else wants to do.\n\n-A lot of deck formatting/power point monkey work where I spend more time aligning logos than doing actual analysis.\n\n-Since I’m the only data person, no one really understands my struggles or can support my tasks, and when something that is easy on paper but tricky to implement, I cannot really easily pushback or manage expectations.\n\n-Due to this chaotic environment, a lot of times I feel very stressed and overwhelmed.\n\n-In summary, I feel more like a glorified commercial assistant or data-ticket monkey than a proper (aspiring) data professional.\n\nThat said, I do get some exposure to more interesting data topics. I collaborate with the central data team on things like dbt models, Power BI dashboards or Airflow orchestration, which has given me some hands-on experience with the modern data stack.\n\nOn top of that, I’m currently doing a Master’s in Data Science/AI which I’ll hopefully finish in less than a year. My dilemma: should I start looking for a new role now, try to get more interesting topics within my org (if possible) or wait until I finish the degree? On one hand, I feel burnt out and don’t see much growth in my current role. On the other hand, I don’t want to burn myself out with even more stress (applications, interviews, etc) when I already have a demanding day-to-day life. Has anyone been in a similar spot?

Great GUI, lots of tutorials.\n\nHoppscotch → A lightweight, open source alternative to Postman. Runs in the browser or self-hosted.\n\nBruno → Stores collections as plain text, easy to version control (great for teams).\n\nHurl → CLI-based, tests APIs using simple text files. Super clean for automation.\n\nYaak → Made by the original Insomnia founder. Sleek UI.\n\nSoapUI → Bit older but strong if you need SOAP and more complex protocols.\n\nApidog → Similar to Postman, but I noticed it has a neat offline mode and works well for designing + mocking APIs.\n\nThunder Client (VS Code extension) → Really handy if you don’t want to leave your editor.\n\n\nFor someone still learning programming, what would you recommend focusing on first?\nShould I start with a GUI tool like Postman/Bruno/Hoppscotch, or dive straight into CLI stuff like Curl/Hurl to build stronger fundamentals?\n\nWould love to hear what worked for you all when you were learning API testing.

My dad's a programmer and dealt with carpal tunnel in his 40s, so I'm trying to be proactive about this stuff.\n\n\n\nHere's what I've started doing that seems to help:\n\nTaking breaks: Set a timer for every 45 minutes, get up and stretch for 5 minutes. Actually doing this consistently has been harder than I expected but it makes a difference. This is necessary, the rest will pay off in the ling run guys. \n\nWrist stretches: Found some good ones on YouTube. The prayer stretch and wrist flexor stretches seem to help the most.\n\nBetter posture: Raised my monitor so I'm not hunching over. Best way to go about it is a standing desk but I don't have enough to invest in an automatic one (Magnus Pro looks so so good!) yet so I haven't gotten one yet. On the other hand, I am still working on keeping my shoulders relaxed, the anxiety I feel constantly keeps them clenched.\n\nSplit keyboard: This was probably the biggest change. Switched to a NocFree Lite about 4 months ago and honestly my wrists feel way more natural now. Takes some getting used to but the angle just feels right. NocFree Lite is just so light and easy to carry around. You'd think that the carrying part was annoying because of the 2 piece product but they provided a carrying bag with the board as well. \n\nProper mouse positioning: Moved my mouse closer and have been on a lookout for a vertical mouse. I've been checking out the Anker wireless vertical ergonomic mouse as well as the Logitech MX vertical, which one is better? Any other ergonomic mouse that I should check out?\n\nAnyone else dealing with this early in their programming journey? What's worked for you? Really don't want to end up like my dad with surgery and months of PT.",

        "content": "So im a somewhat experienced programmer/developer (mostly solo) with well over 10 years experience in many different languages, including some large projects in assembler for microcontrollers.\n\nStill i have a massive issue that im getting repeatedly stunlocked from complex tasks. Atm im adding features to a web-app, i have the UI down, but now it comes to implementing all the code that is required for the UI to function and there are SO many things i have to keep in mind, from all the different edge-cases to how i design classes and their interactions so they are versatile, easy to work with and integrate with existing features without causing too many bugs and so on.\n\nI can usually get this done pretty good, but before i start im allways stunlocked by that task for even multiple days, where i just stare at the code and UI-Mockup and cant start working because i dont know where to start and how i wanna do all this stuff. It takes so much time for my mind to come up with a design that is satisfying to me and clear enough that i can start implementing.\n\nSo my question is: Do some of you who are more experienced have tips, tricks, anything that might help reduce that massive waste of time (thats what it feels like)? I guess what would help is to somehow write this stuff down or visualiize it with something like the Obsidian app, but i have no idea how to do this without wasting even more time.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "I'm not sure if I'm the only person this applies to, but it's certainly very weird for me. For context, I am a sophomore, and in my two math classes Honors Algebra 2 and Honors Geometry, the concepts in there are not exactly impossible to understand, but a bit more difficult to grasp. However, when I learn mathematics for programming, it's much easier compared to math inside school. For more context, I am an ML Engineer, and I've learned much harder topics such as matrices, partial derivatives, derivatives, vectors, and overall just a good amount of calculus and linear algebra for programming. Although it's obvious that I'm not going into incredible depth with those topics, and it's only a basic understanding for what I need, I have created an entire AI from scratch before, and I'm creating another one with a shitty Scratch ripoff called MIT App Inventor, and for any AI nerds out there, that is not an easy task. You must be proficient in your understanding of programming & math, so how the hell can I do that but I can't learn what a domain and range is??\n\nI'm not exactly sure why this happens to me, but it certainly is weird. I should also mention that I learn much better when watching YouTube videos on math compared to learning math in school, so maybe it's just the way I learn. I have an Honors Algebra 2 test on domain and range and a bunch of other things tomorrow such as like increasing intervals and stuff like that, so I'm going to try and figure out a way that I can implement those concepts into programming somehow. If anyone wants an update, I'll post it here.\n\n  \nEdit: I tried implementing programming into my studying, but by the time I did I had already understood everything so there was no need (I'm not sure that makes sense, but when studying how to implement it into code I just eventually learned it so there was no need to..? It's hard to explain.) I was also learning on little sleep & food for the past few weeks or so, so that's probably another factor that should've been mentioned before. My test got pushed back to Tuesday due to people not having their notes filled out, so I guess I'll have to wait until then to see how I do.",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "In your opinion, what would be the best programming language for someone to start learning as early as possible, and why?\n\nThis is a surprisingly controversial question in the programming world because different people value different aspects of coding when it comes to a beginner’s first step. Some argue that a beginner-friendly language like Python is best because it’s simple, readable, and widely used in fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and web development. Others claim that starting with a language like C or C++ is better because it forces you to understand how computers really work at a lower level, teaching concepts like memory management and efficiency right from the beginning.\n\nThere are also people who believe that JavaScript is the most practical first language, since it powers almost everything on the web, is relatively easy to pick up, and allows beginners to quickly see visible results in the form of interactive websites. On the other hand, some would say Java is a strong choice for its structure, object-oriented principles, and massive industry use, making it a good stepping stone to many career opportunities.\n\nBeyond that, there’s the philosophical debate: should beginners start with something easy and motivating, where they can see results quickly and not get discouraged? Or should they start with something challenging and foundational, where they’ll struggle at first but gain a deeper understanding of computer science that pays off later?\n\nThe answer might even depend on age. For very young learners, visual block-based languages like Scratch or beginner-friendly ones like Python might be ideal. But for teenagers or adults who want to dive deeper into real-world applications, the choice becomes far less clear.\n\nSo, the debate is not just “Which language is best?” but also “What matters more for a beginner: ease of entry, or long-term benefit?”",

        "content": "Hey guys, I graduated last year with a master’s in cybersecurity but couldn’t land a job (entry level is rough) and realized I don’t even enjoy cybersecurity that much. What I do enjoy is building stuff people actually use — whether it’s a little game, a Chrome extension, a script, or an app, it honestly makes my day when someone says they’re using something I made. Now I’m wondering with all the AI hype and the tough job market if it’s still worth going deep into software engineering, because ideally I’d like to land a dev job (preferably web or mobile) while also launching my own apps on the side. For context, I know Python/JS/C/C++, built some games in Godot, made a Chrome extension and some simple web apps (mainly using django), done a fair bit of LeetCode, and I’m already comfortable with HTML/CSS/JS/SQL. The thing is I’m not sure how to take it to the next level — is it just “keep building projects” or is there more to it? Should I focus on one tech stack, try different ones, or do something structured like The Odin Project even though I already know the basics? Would love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar spot. Thank you in advance :)",

I took some computer classes, and have been a degenerate gamer online since I was 12 or 13. Like Asmon levels of gaming before I enlisted, 18-20 hours a day until I was 23, then I enlisted, got honorably discharged under medical conditions two years ago because of ankle injury (complete fhl and fdl tear and retear) Last year, I fired up the GI bill and got back into school to support my family. \n\nI am currently living in Dallas, Tx.

My current GPA is good, I am around a 3.2 and I study hard.  \n  \nCurrently unemployed and living off of my disability and GI bill, I am also doing under the table work, cleaning apartments with the abuelas (ICE might put us out of business). I’d much prefer to do something else lol.\n\nI legit struggle to do some daily activities because of this bum leg but we are thuggin' it out for now. I was wondering if doing things like customer service IT, help me on a resume with Programming related work or am I just wasting my time? It’s just supplemental income at the end of the day.\n\nI’m currently taking Programming Logic and Design, Mobile Applications and Development, Intro to Python Programming, and ITSE - Web Design Tools.   \n  \nHonestly, I am just looking for any pointers from anyone who may have been in the same boat at some point.

I would plug ports in some dudes basements for a modest wage for the next 15 aslong as it’s taxable, ngl.\n\nTL;DR: Is there some general beginner level stuff I can start doing that will benefit me? I know in the future there is hackerrack, leetcode, tryhackme etc. I’m nowhere near that. We are doing Atomic Kotlin in my classes and only going two sections deep this semester.

Instead of the usual abstract exercises, I’m creating *realistic bug-fixing scenarios* inspired by problems you might face in actual projects.\n\nEvery week I’ll be sharing a new “bug to fix” in the form of a Colab notebook (for now), so people can practice, learn, and reinforce concepts while thinking like engineers solving real-world issues.\n\nThis very first one is designed for beginners who are just starting out 👶, but the idea is to build a series with different levels: *intern, junior, and semi-senior*. That way, people can grow step by step and tackle challenges that fit their journey.\n\nFor now, all exercises will be in Python 🐍, but I believe they could be just as valuable as a starting point for people who later want to work with other technologies too.  \n  \nPlease send me a private message and I will share the challenge with you.\n\nI’d love to hear your feedback 🙏—does this approach feel useful, fun, or motivating to you? Any suggestions to improve it are more than welcome!\n\nThanks a lot for taking a look 💙",

        "content": "\n\nHey,\n\nI’m a fresher trying to build a project around data architecture concepts like bronze/silver/gold layers and all that jazz. I’m using MySQL for this because I want to get better with it for interviews and projects. I know i can use other tools to clean the messy data but i want to do it using sql to get some hands on experience wigh it\n\nThe trouble is, I have CSV files that contain a bunch of empty strings. MySQL won’t let me import those directly when my columns are typed as INT, DATE, etc. So I thought of two ways but both feel kinda inefficient:\n\n1. Create the table with all columns as `VARCHAR(50) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4`, import the raw data, then *later* clean the data by replacing empty strings with NULL or proper values, and finally convert each column to the right data type.\n\n2. Same as above but instead of replacing empty strings with proper values right away, I replace all empty strings with NULLs first, then work on cleaning/converting.\n\nI’m stuck because both approaches feel like extra work — importing everything as text then cleaning and converting feels like a hassle, especially since I’m still learning.\n\nI’m also wondering if maybe I should just switch to MSSQL since I heard it’s more flexible with empty strings on import, but I really want to stick with MySQL for now.\n\nSo, any tips or best practices for importing messy CSV data with empty fields into MySQL? Am I missing a better way? How do you pros handle these kinds of data issues in real-world projects? Also, if you were me, would you stick to MySQL or try MSSQL instead?",

Part-time and full-time. Successful and not. I do not regret a single day and thankful to every CTO that made a decision to hire me.\n\nSince 2021 I work full-time as frontend engineer in Mercedes-Benz. Amazing company but... I started feeling a little boring. Not specifically about what I do in MB - but overall. I love building UI. And can build some more or less ok-ish backend with Node.js. I just feel it does not bring me the joy It used to bring back then. I tried myself in starting own business as startup founder. Didn't work out. Tried to pair with other founders - same stuff. Anywho...\n\nWhat would you recommend me to check for a new part of the journey? I was thinking of Machine Learning or Data science. Or maybe dive deep into native mobile development with SwiftUI for iOs.\n\nOr maybe Web 3.0, blockchain and IOT?\n\nI know quite little about any of above and should've probably studied what each and every does and responsible for. But, forgive me pls, I wanna hear your piece of advice first.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n36yo with family. Core tech stack: Vue.js, a little of React as well, TypeScript, Node.js.\n\nP.S.: I don't plan to abandon my current position and make a leap of faith but I rather just wanna pick something new and start slowly learning it and later applying. \n\n",

(When process 1’s program is considered by itself, it does not matter in which order these two operations are performed.)”\n\nMy confusion comes from the fact that the code for P1 does not have the b := 1 operation. But the text seems to emphasize that both of these instructions belong to P1, and that under isolation reordering them has no impact on correctness.\n\nIt vaguely makes sense to me that reading the flag before updating it could lead to both processes entering the critical section.\n\nAppreciate any help on how to think about this!",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "This subreddit has a huge FAANG obsession, and it completely distorts the perception of software engineering. Every other post seems to be about insane comp packages, grueling interviews, layoffs, or burnout stories. But if you look at the actual data, the reality for most developers is completely different.\n\n[Resume.io (2025)](https://resume.io/blog/which-professions-are-the-happiest-at-work) found that 87 percent of software developers reported being “very happy” in their jobs, the highest of any profession surveyed. \n\n[Career.io (2024)](https://career.io/career-advice/careers-that-make-americans-happiest) analyzed nearly 756,000 job ratings and found software developers among the most satisfied six figure earners, with a median salary around 130K. \n\n[Market.biz (2025)](https://market.biz/job-satisfaction-statistics/#job-satisfaction-statistics-in-different-industries) reported that 74 percent of tech professionals worldwide are satisfied with their jobs. \n\nSo why does this subreddit feel so negative compared to those numbers? Because the voices dominating here are FAANG engineers or startup employees, and their experiences are extreme. Life inside FAANG is often miserable. Long hours, constant pressure to ship, endless internal politics, and the looming threat of layoffs make it feel like a treadmill you can never step off. Software is the company’s entire product, so everything you do is under constant scrutiny and pressure. Burnout is common, and that is exactly what this sub amplifies.\n\nMeanwhile, the average developer lives a completely different life, and that is what drives the high happiness statistics. Most are not in San Francisco or New York. They live in mid sized cities or suburbs where their salary goes much further. They are not chasing the next billion dollar app. They work at hospitals, insurance companies, banks, logistics firms, or government agencies. The work is steady, respected, and meaningful, even if it never makes headlines.\n\nThey make 100K to 130K, comfortably above the national median. Their hours are closer to forty a week. They get PTO. Their managers are competent but not tyrannical. And because software is a support function rather than the company’s core product, the pressure to grind nonstop is low. That is why surveys consistently show high satisfaction.\n\nThe quiet majority of developers who live this life rarely post here. Nobody makes a thread to say “My job is stable, I like my team, I worked normal hours, and I had a great weekend hiking.” The loud minority who post are often FAANG engineers or startup refugees talking about their misery. That is why this subreddit can make software engineering seem miserable, even though for most people it is not.\n\nThe truth is that chasing FAANG is often what ruins people’s perception of software engineering. It is the exception, not the rule. The average developer is happy, balanced, and living a peaceful, stable, and well-compensated life. Even in 2024 and 2025, software engineering remains one of the happiest and most rewarding professions you can choose, as long as you understand that most developers do not live the FAANG nightmare that dominates this subreddit.",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Lately, I have been seeing a lot of posts around how engineers feel burnt out, stuck, or afraid AI will take their jobs.\n\nI can relate to this as well because not too long ago, I myself was that engineer who did good work like just working really hard, doing as many tickets as fast as I can, working overtime or on weekends, etc., but still felt completely invisible. Being introverted, I’d also join meetings, and just mostly stay quiet and never really contribute much. Honestly, it made me question if I’d ever stand out in any way.\n\nWhat surprised me was that things started changing not when I worked harder, but when I worked differently. I began focusing on things like communicating my work so people could actually see the impact, building trust and alignment with teammates, finding small ways to speak up and make my contributions more visible, etc.\n\nThat shift made a huge difference. I actually started working less, got a better work-life balance, and finally started getting the recognition I wanted. Also made me realize that promotions and opportunities ended up coming as a side effect of that shift, not because I was grinding harder.\n\nI know it’s tough because “just do more tickets” feels like the safe path, but in my experience, it rarely leads to visibility. For me, changing how I worked gave me both better career growth and more fulfillment in the job.\n\nCurious if anyone else has felt the same? Do you feel like you’re in the grind stage, or have you found other ways to break out of burnout?",

I want to share what I learned over 10+ years that could save you from making the same mistakes I did.\n\nThe Reality Check:\n\nWhen I started, I thought being a good developer meant:\n\n\\- Memorising every framework and language\n\n\\- Writing perfect code from day one\n\n\\- Working insane hours to \"prove myself\"\n\n\\- Never admitting I didn't know something\n\nAll of this was wrong and held me back for years.\n\nWhat Actually Matters:\n\nFor Job Applications:\n\nYou don't need to meet 100% of job requirements. I got interviews, meeting 60-70% of the requirements. Companies hire for potential and problem-solving ability, not just current skills.\n\nFor Learning:\n\nStop trying to learn everything. Focus on core concepts (data structures, algorithms, design patterns) and learn specific technologies as you need them. The best skill is learning how to learn quickly.\n\nFor Career Growth:\n\nYou'll never feel \"ready\" for the next level. I spent 2 years over-preparing for senior roles I was already qualified for. Apply anyway, volunteer for challenging projects anyway, give that tech talk anyway.\n\nFor Productivity:\n\nWorking 45 focused hours produces better results than 70 exhausted hours. Burnout isn't a badge of honour, it's a career killer. Take breaks, have hobbies, maintain relationships outside tech.\n\nFor Code Quality:\n\nNobody cares about your clever algorithms. They care about solutions that work and code that's maintainable. Write for the human who will read your code at 2 AM during an outage.\n\nI've written a comprehensive blog post with detailed examples and actionable advice for each of these points: [https://medium.com/@pcodesdev/10-years-of-programming-hard-earned-coding-lessons-to-save-you-a-decade-of-mistakes-d63fd848e62e?sk=5bad34c41e6426a28387e89f4e1f5412](https://medium.com/@pcodesdev/10-years-of-programming-hard-earned-coding-lessons-to-save-you-a-decade-of-mistakes-d63fd848e62e?sk=5bad34c41e6426a28387e89f4e1f5412)\n\nCurrent developers: What do you wish you'd known earlier?\n\nJob seekers: Which of these resonates most with your current struggles?",

I also help less experienced data analyst in our division with queries, and lead data analytics workshops at work.\n\nMy career journey has been weird, and it's mostly been chasing connections that has got me to where I'm at. A lot of my co-workers and ex-bosses have wanted me to tag along, and I've been chasing money and benefits without really think of much anything else.\n\nThe problem is: I've never had to work very deep in any of this. My React App is a very barebones. We have only just started using ADO for version control (I'm a solo dev there and out EIT department is just now requiring it).\n\nMy data analytics projects have never been complex SQL. I know CTEs, windows functions, and enough to get the job done.\n\nI've built a few regression models that have gone nowhere. Companies are slowly finding out that \"simpler\" analysis brings much more realistic results than a fancy model.\n\nI've built very small data pipelines (Data scraping with Python -> clean in python -> SQL) to clean data and have built some very barebones schemas.\n\nBut I look at the job market and everything is progressing at a much faster rate than what I know. I'm afraid I'm being left behind with my age, new technologies, and knowing many tools but not being great at any of them.\n\nThoughts on this? Thanks for listening.",

        "content": "I work at a tech company in London, UK, and we recently opened up a junior developer position, which we posted online. Within minutes, applications started pouring in, tens of them right away, and within just two hours, we had hundreds. The applicants ranged from those with a couple of years of experience to developers with over 10 years in the UK tech industry.\n\nThis really highlights how competitive the tech job market has become. It feels like there’s a growing imbalance, far more developers than available positions. I don't recall this situation in the old hires. With new graduates entering the field each year, it’s unlikely the situation will improve anytime soon.\n\nIf you're job hunting, my best advice is to find a way to stand out. Do something that helps your application rise above the noise, because often the hardest part is simply getting your CV seen by a recruiter in a sea of hundreds.\n\n**Update** : I've previously received some questions about the role and would like to clarify a few things. I will not be able answer all questions but I would like answer some of them here;\n\n\\- The role is not a remote job, it's a hybrid role based in London Office.\n\n\\- We required right to work in the UK and no sponsorships.\n\n\\- The majority of applicants are based in UK with some exceptions of South Asian (India, Pakistan etc.), African (Nigeria, South Africa etc.) and North American (Canada and US) applicants in 10s.\n\n\\- We posted on multiple platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn and company website.\n\n\\- The whole process is overwhelming as human review will take quite some time to process all the applicants unless we switch to AI based CV reading tools.\n\n\\- The number of applicants surpassed a few hundred in the first few hours, and 1,000+ by the end of the first day of the job posting.\n\n\\- The salary is inline with average junior salaries in the UK which is between £30k to £40k.\n\n\\- There are a lot of uk based mid and senior engineers who apply, which shows stagnant job market which once only affected juniors, now clearly started to hit mid and senior levels too.\n\n\\- Additionally this is my burner/junk account, not my main account. I don't want to risk my job by making myself and my company identifiable, which could easily happen if I posted from my main account. I made sure, obviously, not to be the person who shares the company’s internal recruitment information on the internet.\n\n\\- Also I want to clarify that I craft and rephrase my paragraphs using ChatGPT and Grammarly, which is quite standard practice in this day and age.\n\n\\- If you have more questions feel free to reach me out via chat, I can't promise a response to all messages, but I will do my best.

To stay in the game, I took on low-paying part-time contract work to build real-world experience, and I went to meetups to network and keep learning.\n\nFast forward to today. I’ve just landed my first full-time role as a Backend Engineer in a mid-cost-of-living area, earning a decent starting wage for that area. It may not be the biggest salary, but to me, it represents something much greater, a milestone I’ve been working toward for years.\n\nMy biggest takeaway: don’t give up.

I know the job market is ultra-competitive right now but it's still my responsibility to work with what I have, and I haven't been.\n\nI realized during the five years I've studied Computer Science that even though I love video-games and thought robotics was alright (I did robotics programming in highschool & during my senior project, mentored by AmazonRobotics), I have no confidence in programming, and frankly, problem-solving in general. Everything is so reliant on connecting/social engineering now that my anti-social ass hasn't been doing. My parents have gotten people from my church and extended family, to give advice to me and frankly I've mostly been ignoring them when they repeat the same stuff I've been hearing for a while now. I apply to X position a family/family friend tells me to apply to, I get rejected/ghosted, repeat ad-nauseam until I stopped applying months down the line out of frustration, lying to them saying \"yeah I applied to plenty of places\". Confidence is at an all-time low.\n\nToday my mom yells at me on how much I've been freeloading and threatens to kick me out, and I couldn't talk back at her because I know she's right.  \n  \n**For the short-term,** I have $2,700 in my bank account, pretty much nothing to live on my own for. I hate being around my family but really want a remote position to show to my parents ASAP, so I don't get the boot. At this point I don't care what field it is, it doesn't have to be CS/programming--I really want to get a remote job in SOMETHING I can tolerate, in the next couple weeks or so while I try and gather my bearings for my future, or else I am likely getting kicked out. Preferably something that doesn't get too in the way of me studying for certs.\n\n**For the long-term,** If it helps, again, I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science, a AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, and am currently studying for the CompTIA A+ certification because I figured maybe I can try the IT space if I hate programming so much (already paid for a voucher, planning to take the exam in \\~2 weeks). Unfortunately had no real work experience/internships in the Comp. Sci. field as I was too busy just trying not to drop out; took me 5 years to graduate. I've worked Doordash for a couple months using the family car, until my parents forbade me from doing so (for asinine reasons but it's their car so I can't talk back). I thought I was passionate in programming, I'm not. I have pretty much no passion in anything except games and anime, both industries sound awful to actually work in. Last week I started brainstorming a Unity game since I randomly thought it would be nice to work on something, anything, and put it on GitHub. \n\n**I'm well-aware that my story is not rare. Again, this is my fault. I've been too passive, and arrogant. But today I might as well ask for advice, both for the short and long-term. Thank you.** ",

I found it was better to just go through and understand it myself, so I’d know what we changed and why\n\nI found myself being pressured to do this in like, 4 hours across several apps. When I told them why it was hard, they said I should just be able to use AI for something like this\n\nThe last few times I tried that, I found it did an incomplete job and I had to keep prompting it in different ways to complete the task. In the end, it had the same result as me but the process was slower and more frustrating \n\nIs this happening in other peoples jobs?",

Likewise, I don't care how prestigious you are - you're a TRASH company to me if you show no respect for applicants' time.\n\n\\--- Update\n\nI might not have explained myself clearly and caused some confusion based on the comments I received. Think about two different recruiting workflows:\n\n1. AI screening -> manual screening -> applicant completes the OA -> interview process...\n2. Applicant completes the OA -> AI screening -> manual screening -> interview process...\n\nThe second approach doesn't make any sense, unless the screening algorithm gives the OA result high weight/priority (even so you can still apply AI screening without OA before the OA). It's a huge waste of applicants' time as they could have been rejected in the first place instead of wasting huge amount of time and energy grinding down the OA tasks. \n\nHowever, AFAIK, it feels like a bunch of companies have implemented their workflow as #2.

I catch bugs, provide helpful feedback, mentor junior devs through their code. But I'm also slowly going insane because I haven't shipped anything meaningful in months. Just endless reviews of other people's work. Management loves me because I prevent production issues. But I'm starting to resent every \"hey can you quick review this\" message. It's never quick. It's never just one. Tried delegating some reviews and using tools like greptile for the initial pass, but honestly nothing replaces human judgment for architectural decisions. Still helps with the obvious stuff though. Anyone successfully escaped the \"senior reviewer trap\"? How do you say no without being seen as unhelpful? I miss actually building things.",

As I go through my classes though I'm finding a hard time with getting the motivation to actually code. I've met a lot of smart and wonderful people in my major and a fair share of them are very passionate and enjoy coding, whether it's reading a research paper about a specific topic they're interested in, making side projects for fun, joining a club for it, making a startup, etc. I just feel like I'm not into it as much as them and seeing this discrepancy daily makes me wonder if computer science just isn't for me. I don't enjoy watching youtube videos or reading about computer science, I don't really care about learning some new coding language and only learned the ones I currently know because it was required for the major, algorithms and the math of it don't really interest me, and I don't really have any side projects that interest me enough to code it.\n\nMaybe I just haven't found the right area of computer science that'll eventually hook me or maybe all my friends are just outliers and their passion isn't the norm, but I feel a little stuck as I'm trying to force myself to find something enjoyable about it, but besides the pay nothing else sticks out. I'm assuming the typical FAANG and SWE jobs are similar to the projects and assignments we did for my major, and if they are I just don't know if I can find myself doing that as a 9-5 for years of my life even if the pay is good.\n\nSo I guess my question is, how do you know when computer science as a career just isn't for you?

I'd take a bit of time each week to dig into the technologies I was using at work to try and find non-functional areas we could improve in as I was grinding out functional stuff. over time this built up to an okay understanding of the SDLC overall.\n\nthere are plenty of areas I'm still not very strong, but at this point I have enough experience with enough different things that its relatively uncommon i encounter problems totally out of band from what I've seen before, and have a fairly decent understanding of many of the popular technologies used today across a wide span of problems. \n\nIve worked in a lot of different domains over my career. ive generally left most of the parsing of those domains to domain experts. sure, I'd pick up things here or there, enough exposure to particular verticals will do that, but I generally focused my time and energy on developing my tech knowledge, as it is more portable between jobs than domain specific stuff.\n\nthat said, I can now see the limits of this approach. I've been working in the same shop now for four years and I wish I had spent a little bit of time each week better learning the domain I am working in from first principles. I dont feel like I am lacking in technical ability. I have enough technical tools at my disposal. I feel I am lacking in domain specific insight, and so are the others surrounding me.\n\n If i had been studying my current domain a little bit more here and there over the past 4 years, I suspect I wouldn't feel this way. I suspect I would be able to crack some of the tough nut problems we've been dealing with sensibly.\n\nlooking back, there were plenty of times in past roles where I wasnt able to see the forest for the trees as a result of a little too much domain blindness & outsourcing of that knowledge to others who perhaps didn't know the domain all that well either.\n\nanyways, the advice I wish I had gotten was to carve out a bit of time for myself to learn the domain I was working in outside of the context of tech and programming. SWE skills are important, and most of the time we can learn the bits and pieces of a domain we need at the time, but some insights are locked behind both a general understanding of the tech and the domain.",

I delivered several projects and a huge rework for our MAIN web app.\n\nI also had a separate meeting about my PIP where I express my concerns. My boss explained to me she MOVED me onto this team because it’s a dumpster fire. She told me “they don’t know write and deliver code, there needs to be guidance for the QA”. Etc. ALSO these people when they write commits write the most bare minimum simple messages. What I am trying to get at is I was transferred to a UNSTRUCTURED AWFUL SPAGHETTI CODE REPO.\n\nMy boss said oh you can do this, don’t worry. We need to see growth here, velocity increase here, and make sure you do all the trainings etc… but there is no growth at this company. No promotions. No motivation.\n\nSo what are my options? First, is this PIP even allowed after a transfer so short?\n\nSecondly I feel im being mistreated, is there a path I can go towards?\n\nThirdly I’d even go as far as taking SHORT TERM DISABILITY and riding on their money.

        "content": "I’ve been with a small company for about 3 years (8 years total experience). The first couple years were great — I had an awesome manager and was doing pure data science/R&D. But over the last year things have shifted. My team went from data scientists to “AI engineers” building production software, and I’ve basically been pushed into leading a small AI software team despite having no real software dev background.\n\nI keep telling leadership that software engineering and data science are very different skill sets, but it doesn’t matter — they expect me to lead, teach, and deliver. The stress has been brutal and I’m burnt out.\n\nI’ve been applying to data science roles since April (remote, similar pay to my current salary) but haven’t had much luck. My network is mostly engineers, so not super helpful for data roles. I feel like if I lowered my salary expectations I’d probably land something sooner, but I’d be taking a pay cut.\n\nMeanwhile, my company is shaky financially — they’ve already had a few rounds of layoffs and I’d guess they’ve got maybe a year or two of runway left. Part of me wonders if I should just coast, stop caring so much, and wait to be laid off while applying to better jobs. The other part of me feels like I should just cut my losses now and more aggressively seek a lower-paying but more sustainable role.\n\nWhat would you do?",

He regularly ghosts for 2+ hours himself\n• Super friendly in team chat, but in meetings with management he screen-shares our code and roasts us. \"Why is this so bad?\" \"Who wrote this garbage?\" Same code he approved btw\n• Spends hours helping interns with basic Docker while actual sprint burns, then asks why we're behind\n• Now making me come to office few days more to \"improve motivation.\" Only he has issues with my work - business side and cto think I'm fine\n\nThe weirdest part is after besting me me for 30 mins straight in personal meeting, he'll switch to \"let's help each other improve 🙂\" mode like it is nothing.\n\nGot no raise this year and a lot of people also in comaony, but somehow he got nice bump over this year.\nI slowed down since start of the year and came down to work 3 hours a day to just do the job.

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm feeling stuck in my career and don't know what my next move is. I have been working in tech support since 2019, primary in the web-hosting space. While it's always been a grind with the nonstop chats/calls/tickets, I legitimately enjoyed it at first for the first two years or so. My first company was awesome. They are one of the best web hosts to work for. I was a level 2 tech and a top performer, easily knocking out 80+ chats a day. My manager would constantly tell me how good of a job I was doing. Despite that, I struggled to afford living in the city the company was based in. I eventually asked for a raise and was offered a one thousand dollar per YEAR raise. It wasn't sustainable to keep waiting around for an actual raise, so I quit very shortly after that to move to a major cloud computing company as a cloud support engineer. I ended up hating that company almost immediately because of their lack of training, vague protocols, poor documentation and how they clearly viewed their support department as an after thought. Only 2 or 3 months out of training, they laid off 10% of their staff including me.\n\nI've since landed a different job at another web host as a support manager. I thought I would enjoy this role but truth be told I absolutely despise my job and my company. I feel that my work is meaningless and repetitive. The agents under me are basically un-coachable and uninspired. The tech debt is immense. The higher ups are too focused on pushing out half baked products that barely work. Our back end infrastructure is a nightmare. I spend most of my time troubleshooting stuff that should have been fixed years ago, yet engineering has no plans of doing so. \n\nEssentially, I'm stuck in support hell.\n\nI really like working with computers but the past three years have left me feeling so drained that I hardly have the energy to upskill and find a better, non-customer facing role. I don't like working in tech support and I don't like working in tech support management. I constantly think about working on certs to get a job as an SRE or DevOps engineer, but I'm worried that I'd find myself in the same position of not finding any satisfaction in it. Plus the tech market is so competitive now that I feel like I don't know where to even start. I'm left with the question of \"do I want to leave the tech world or do I just hate working in support?\"\n\nHas anyone else broken out of support hell into a more technical, non customer facing role? What did it take? Did it reshape your opinion of your work? Do you find it more fulfilling? ",

My ideal route would be to complete my bachelors with a specialization in ML and then get a masters in ML. It’s a field I have been interested in since I can remember but I’m having doubts as to the career prospects both out of my bachelors and after my masters. \n\nThe Canadian job bank in my area has categorized CS as having a “good” job outlook meaning there’s expected growth in the market. I also checked the statistics for CS in California and I was met with a similar outlook despite everything online saying the market is oversaturated and to pivot while you still can. Is this just anecdotal vs statistical evidence or is there something of note there?\n\nIt would suck to give up on CS as I genuinely enjoy it but would it be wise to pivot into something else while I still can? If so what would have good prospects? If I continue with CS how would I go about breaking into the industry with a seemingly disappearing entry point? Are internships my only hope?\n\nCS has kind of been my only plan as it’s what my father does and what I’ve grown up around.",

The pay is decent and there used to be a fair amount of flexibility, but there’s always this constant rush to deploy things.\n\nTwo years ago, two new devs joined the team. The client is the CEO of the company, not very technical, but he often pushes “shortcuts” to speed up development. Usually they’re hacky and add technical debt. Because he messages devs individually instead of going through a single point of contact which should be one of the devs that can convert his request into a technical solution, the result is a messy codebase where people step on each other’s toes. One of the newer devs is inexperienced and sometimes pushes changes that break other people’s work. I do code reviews on his work whenever we have time, but those are happening in a rush because I always have something that I need to deploy myself asap.\n\nOn top of that, there’s never enough time to write clean code. Almost everything is for a demo or “needs to be deployed ASAP.” We start working on big changes on reporting a week before the end of the month, with the target of having it ready at the beginning of the next month. We end up doing daily production deployments on a fairly large app. This app is used by big company clients' employees, the entire marketing team which is the main activity of the company, and even manages customer relationships, so it’s not a toy project.\n\nMy concern is that after 7 years, I don’t feel like I’ve gained much real experience because of the constant rush and hacky workarounds.

        "content": "\\[Senior DevOps Engineer, 17 YOE\\]\n\nHi. I'm at a crossroads in my life and I don't know what to do. I'm terrified and fearless at the same time.\n\nI'm 46 years old and so tired. Not just from work but tired in a way that's way deeper. A life of illness, stress, chaos, C-PTSD and then when I finally got back on my feet again - four more years of illness, cancer, surgeries. My body is scarred and worn down, even as my brain still wanting more of something. It's exhausting being in a brain that still dreams, in a body that can't keep up. No friends, no one to love. Just me.\n\nAt work, I tried to find meaning by stepping up. Looking at the bigger picture, connecting people, fighting for the things that make engineering great - systems that work, accountability, sustainability. What I really want to do is to bridge gaps, to build something... with joy. I'm operating at the Staff Engineer level alone - because no-one else is - and it's like threading mud in minus 20 degrees. Reality is fcking brutal and is weighing me down; it's eating away at my core values and taking all the fun out of my life.\n\nWhile management has fantastically supported me during my illness, they also lack true leadership. Fourteen years after starting the company the structure and behaviors are still stuck in start-up mode and often ends up looking for simple solutions to complex problems - or hope they will go away by themselves. The inertia is frustrating like... fck!!! Then there is the \"senior founder dev\" who only cares about code, knows he is untouchable, makes everything harder, belittles others, poisons the culture. And the colleagues I love and respect; the ones I thought could carry this with me, I can feel them pulling away, finding their own exits.\n\nIt has left me doubting; if that is the right word... what am I even holding onto? What the hell am I doing? What is the point??? :( \n\nI've lost joy in the work, but I still have passion when I can help people become better. My values haven't changed, but I have to push them aside every day, compromise after compromise, and that has slowly eroded my self-confidence and self-worth. I still want to work with smart, passionate people, to build something that matters - a product, a service, something that makes life a little bit better for someone else. I really do care about things running well. I care about people. But instead of feeling part of that, I feel stuck. I keep falling behind in technology while I fight my body (that tend to just shut down for three hours after lunch time). I'm trying to \"catch up\" and but I never quite get there...\n\nAnd outside of all this what I really crave is something... simpler and slower, I just don't know what. A house in the countryside maybe. A place that feels like home. Work that connects to who I am, not just what I can grind out. Maybe I should move back north and try to reconnect with my old friends and just do something outside of tech?\n\nWhat I don't know is how to get there without breaking more pieces of myself in the process. How to leave without bitterness and to stop running on fumes and start moving toward something I can actually love again.\n\n*tldr; my life isn't perfect, but I'm still here fighting - but there is no joy left and I've lost myself.*\n\n*PS. English is my secondary language and I closed my Grammarly account so apologize if the text is messy.*\n\n",

It feels like a hype-driven bubble, and I don’t want to learn a stack just because it’s trendy.\n* My main focus has been building solid, scalable backend systems, and I enjoy working in that space.\n* I don’t mind picking up GenAI *if it becomes unavoidable in backend roles*, but I don’t want to spread myself too thin.\n\n  \nTo be clear:\n\n* I am not the type of person who chases the latest tech hype unless it directly benefits my day-to-day work.\n* Even though I am interested in GenAI personally, right now what I want to focus more on is being employable and relevant in the upcoming years as a Java backend developer.\n* I am also focusing on a specific side-hustle which I want to turn around into a full time business in the future, so I don't have the time to pursue/learn something new from the scratch unless it is absolutely necessary.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n* Will I be missing out on backend job opportunities now (or in the next few years) if I don’t learn GenAI?\n* Is GenAI integration actually becoming a *must-have* skill for Java/Spring Boot developers, or is it still more of a niche?\n* From a long-term career perspective (5+ years), would I be better off becoming a stronger backend engineer with deep cloud/microservices/devops skills, or should I invest in GenAI sooner rather than later?\n* For those of you working in the industry — are companies actually *expecting* backend developers to know GenAI, or is it more of a nice-to-have skill for specific roles/domains?\n\nI’d love to hear from people in the industry (especially those hiring or working on enterprise systems).

Do you know Angular?\"  Even saying yes, they didn't ask me any questions to demonstrate that I knew it.  \n\nSo, the reason I haven't been applying much is that because when I finally do get an interview, I either nailed it and still get rejected for silly reasons, or I didn't get anything out of it, and with all that time of preparation and then the interview, I could have made 400 dollars driving Uber instead, so it's not really me being negative and thinking nothing is worth it, but more that interviews have become too much of a time investment with no return on it of either getting the job or getting more relevant interview practice. \n\nA bit about my background, I worked with Cognizant for 2 years mostly on the bench and on projects they ended up offshoring before any relevant experience and one job I got with an airline company, a month in they decided to disband the team because there wasn't enough work to be done and they just combined the services to other teams because we were spending several hours per day doing almost nothing.\n\nI don't feel I've ever been given a chance on any of my consulting projects as they seemed to only be using me as a contractor for a possible project not set in stone and ended up releasing me after budget cuts or offshoring. \n\nSo, at interviews, I know the programming languages, many of the challenges, and how to answer questions about how frameworks and APIs work, but they only ask about what projects I did and then agile related questions and nothing about coding, so I've not been finding any reason to take more interviews.  \n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way, or am I being ridiculous and a negativity spreader?

I’ve always found ML to be really cool and I’ve done a research internship in this field. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to get any ML engineer or data scientist jobs right out of undergrad (they wouldn’t even interview me). I suspect the lack of a graduate degree to be the reason, and many job postings I find interesting ask for or prefer one. \n\nHow can I pivot to a more quantitative role from SWE. If I continue working as a SWE I’m afraid I will be stuck. I’ve been contemplating going back for a Masters but a few things irk me:\n\n1. I don’t want to pay 5 figures for a masters, and funded masters often ask for TA and research experience, which I lack. I did go to a competitive school so maybe my GPA can be contextualized — hard to say though. I am in state for Texas, and I could potentially pay for TAMU or UT for a semester and gamble on getting a TA position.\n2. Opportunity cost. Say I do get a masters, there’s no guarantee I will get a job in ML, and I would end up working as a SWE anyway. Minus 2 years of comp\n3. There’s millions of MS CS grads in the market and I would be competing with them for jobs in an already shaky market.\n\nAnyone who’s been through this song and dance want to chime in? In my company moving internally to a research role is very rare so that’s not possible. I really enjoyed my ML research and coursework, and I am open to working for a university lab as a researcher, as a pathway for a PhD. The lab I interned at has changed direction and focuses more on computational biology, the ML project was a one off I guess. So there’s no going back to that. My long term goal is doing applied ML at a company or in academia. This is highly coveted and competitive, so any input would be appreciated.",

It doesn’t feel like a good thing especially now that I have to make such an important decision about what I should do bachelors in just a few days. I’m confused and worried about making the wrong choice, and I really don’t want to regret it later.\n\nI’d really appreciate any guidance or advice on how to approach this decision. Thanks alot.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I would like to hear some opnions from people more experienced than me.\nI’ve been working at Microsoft (India) for about 5 years now. Got promoted to Senior.\nHowever, I’ve been feeling burnt out and craving a career break of 3-5 months.\n\nWould it be a wise decision to take a few months off? I plan to just spend time with my family, traveling but also studying about distributed systems in depth and prepping myself for the “second” phase of my career. Financials are not a problem. I have money saved to last me the next 5 years.\n\nMy current job is great. I feel valued. Salary is great. Work hours? Well, sometimes its 12+ hours a day but that’s not the norm. It’s a never ending cycle of highs and lows. 6 hour days followed by 12 hour days and so on…\nBut the feeling to say fuck it and chill for the next few months is so strong, I keep thinking about this question every couple of months.\n\nHas anyone here taken a career break? What was your experience like? How hard was it to break into a tech role again? \nIf you could share your experience, it would help me a lot.\n\nThank you!\nPS: if anyone needs guidance or referrals ( up till mid level SWE), DM me. I get more satisfaction through helping people out than my job tbh.\n",

        "content": "[Student](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/?f=flair_name%3A%22Student%22)\n\nSo to start off, i'm 20. Never worked a job before, not even McDonalds. GPA is bang average at 3.29. 3rd Year CS student, with a minor in Business (intended minor). Love movies, very passionate, write a lot in my free time, directed a couple shorts for fun (worked on a couple of other student productions as well), vice president of a film discussion club (started this semester, so its been about 2 weeks). Been Marketing chair for a student organization for one semester in my sophomore year, and now doing the same position again (took a break in between as I transferred).\n\nIt suddenly dawned on me that companies like Canon, GoPro and other companies that produce technology need active software developers for research and development. My issue now is that\n\n1.) I don't have a job, not even a simple part time. I'm taking 16 credit hours, and very hard CS classes. I naturally have a learning curve in CS so it takes me longer than usual to get in to the groove and understand. The lack of ANY job, obviously makes me look bad and immediately puts me in a disadvantage\n\n2.) Only relevant CS experience is that I made a garbage GPT wrapper at a hackathon over a year ago. I also know Java and Python, but not certified in either of them.\n\nI'm feeling very hopeless because of this. My real passion is cinema, but in this day and age it's not wise to go into that field without backup. I think developing technology for cameras and other tools that filmmakers will end up using is something that can keep me content and fulfilled. Am I doomed? Can I mainly crack an internship by Summer 2026? What should I do?",

        "content": "Part of me knows this is an overreaction but part of me is also very worried.\n\nI'm just about to enter my 3rd year of university in this fall and I had just about thrown away all hope of landing an internship this late in the fall but on Wednesday I got a call from an IT internship position I applied to. I had applied to it back in July but got ghosted despite 2 assessments, but I the posting reappeared (maybe the person they offered the role to declined it?) so I applied again and I guess they remembered me from that first time. \n\nSo they call me and ask me if I'm still interested, if I have a means to get there, what my salary expectations are, if I'd be able to work on-site every day, etc. I keep it simple, say yes to everything, keep the salary expectation humble because I do still want this job and it's entry-level. And then they say \"when would you be able to start? Would you be available to start next week?\" (week of September 1st) to which I reply \"I don't think I'd be able to start next week, but I can start next next week, the week of the 8th\". Then we wrapped it up and they said I'd be hearing from them very soon. \n\nI didn't think much of it at first but nothing is REALLY stopping me from starting next week. I have some commitments but they could be postponed. I feel like I'm overthinking but I can't help but think about them going with somebody else who *could* start next week. Like that one line sabotaged this whole operation.\n\nThat being said, I looked through my recent calls and they had actually called me multiple times, on Monday and Tuesday (I tend not to pick up random calls). But I feel like if there were multiple other people they could've hired, they would've called me once, and then moved on to the next guy after I didn't pick up. But I find that equally as unlikely because this is cs and they must have tons of candidates. \n\nI know this reads as rambly but I'm just really holding out for this internship! ",
