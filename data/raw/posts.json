        "author": "roey132",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Recently I decided to start out as a Freelancer, a big part of my problem was that I need to show some projects in my portfolio and github, but most of my work was in corporates and I cant share any of the information or show code from my experience. So, I decided to make some projects for my portfolio, to show demos of what I offer as a freelancer for companies and startups.\n\nAs an experiment, I decided to try out vibe coding, setting up a fully automated daily batch etl from api requests to aws lambda functions, athena db and daily jobs with flows and crawlers.\n\nTakes from my first project:\n\n1. Vibe coding is a trap, if I didn't have 5 years of experience, I wouldv'e made the worst project I could imagine, with bad and old practices, unreadable code, no edgecase handling and just a lot of bad stuff\n2. It can help with direction, and setting up very simple tasks one by one, but you shouldn't give the AI large tasks at once.\n3. Always try to provide your prompts a taste of the data, the structure is never enough.\n4. If you spend more than 20 minutes trying to solve a problem with AI, it probably won't solve it. (at least not in a clean and logical way)\n5. The code it creates between files and tasks is very inconsistent, looks like a different developer made it everytime, make sure to provide it with older code it made so it knows to keep the consistency.\n\nExample of my worst experience:\n\nI tried creating a crawler for my partitioned data reading CSV files from S3 into an athena table. my main problem was that my dates didnt show up correctly, the problem the AI thought was very focused on trying to change data formats until it hits something that athena supports. the real problem was actually in another column that contained commas in the strings, but because I gave the AI the data and it looked at the dates as the problem, no matter what it tried, it never tried to look outside the box. I tried for around 2.5-3 hours fixing this problem, and ended up fixing it in 15 minutes by using my eyes instead of the AI.\n\n  \nLink to the final project repo: [https://github.com/roey132/aws\\_batch\\_data\\_demo](https://github.com/roey132/aws_batch_data_demo)\n\n\\*Note\\* - The project could be better, and there are many places to fix and use much better practices, i might review them in the future, but for now, im moving onto the next project (taking the data from aws to a streamlit dashboard.)\n\nHope it helps anyone! good luck with your projects and learning, and remember, AI is good, but its still not a replacement for your experience.",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Im a DE with several years of experience in analytics, but after a year into my role, I’m starting to feel like a failure. I wanted to become a DE because somewhere along the lines of me being an analyst, I decided I like SWE more than data analysis/science and felt DE was a happy medium.\n\nBut 1 year in, I’m not sure what I signed up for. I constantly feel like a failure at my job. Every single day I feel utterly confused because the business side of things is not clear to me - I’m given tasks, not sure what the big picture is, not sure what it is I’m supposed to accomplish. I just “do” without really knowing the upstream side of things. Then I’m told to go through source data and just feel expected to “know” how everything tied together without receiving guidance or training on the data. I ask questions and I’ve been more proactive after receiving some negative feedback lately about my ability to turn things around-frequently assigned tasks that are assumed to be “4 hours of effort” that realistically take at least few days. Multiply one task by 4-5 tasks and this is expected to be completed in a span of less than 2 weeks. \n\nI ask, communicate, document, etc. But at the end of it all, I still feel my questions aren’t being answered and my lack of knowledge due to lack of exposure or clear instructions makes me seem frequently dumb (ie: manager will be like “why would you not do this” when it was never previously explained to me and where there was no way I’d know without somebody telling me). I’ve made mistakes that felt sh*tty too because I’m so pressured to get something done on time that it ends up being sloppy. I am not really using my technical skills at all-at my old job, being one of the few people who wrote code relatively well, I developed interactive tools or built programs/libraries that really streamlined the work and helped scale things and I was frequently recognized for that work. When I go on the data science sub, I’m made to feel that my emphasis on technical skills is a waste of time because it’s the “business” and not “technical skills” that’s worth $$$. I don’t see how the 2 are mutually exclusive? I find my team has a technical debt problem and the deeper we get there, the more I don’t think this helps scale business. A lot of our “business solutions” can be scaled up for several clients but because we don’t write code and do processes in a way where we can re-use it for different use cases, we’re left with spending way too much time doing stuff tediously and manually that prolongs delays that usually then ends up feeling like a blame game that comes right back at me. \n\nI’ve been trying, really trying to reflect and be honest with myself. I’ve tried to communicate with my boss that I’m struggling with the workload. But I feel like there’s a feeling at the end that it’s me. \n\nI don’t feel great. I wish I was in a SWE role but I don’t even think that’s realistically possible for me given my lack of experience and the job market. Also not sure SWE is the move. My role seems to be evolving into a project management/product manager role and while I don’t mind gaining those skills, I also don’t know what I’m doing anymore. I don’t think this job seems like a good fit for me but I don’t know what other jobs I can do. I’ve thought about the AI/ML engineering team on my job but I don’t have enough experience at all for it. I feel too technically unskilled for other engineer jobs but not “business savvy” enough to do a non-technical project/product based role. If anybody has insight, I’d appreciate it. ",

Does semantic modelling layer sit on top of a dimensional model? \n\nI would really appreciate it if someone could point me to some case studies of different organisations and their data warehouse.",

I apologize if this question sounds very beginner-like (we're just taking our first steps in data analysis). We don't have a DBA to optimize the query; data preparation, business rules, and graph creation are all handled by the systems analyst (me).

I am also an elder millennial and my family were especially early internet adopters, so I have been using the internet since 1997. My middle school had a weeks work of lesson plans teaching us how to coax relevant results out of Altavista and Lycos using quotes, booleans etc.\n\nHowever, I find that the internet is increasingly unusable and I have become a bit too dependent on CGPT. Like, I straight up can no longer find answers to questions. I can't even find webpages or documentation that I know exists, I just can't remember the URL. The old standby of adding \"reddit\" to the question doesn't work either, any post older than a month is all \"obtuse rubber goose up your nose with a rubber hose\" redacted slop.\n\nI can't find answers to questions on stackoverflow and a lot of documentation for python packages is essentially unusable (pyarrow, airflow core not provider packages). I have tried getting a subscription to a premium search engine (Kagi). It's marginally better than google but still extremely frustrating. \n\nSo, like....how do you get unstuck in the year 2025?

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "So I am in my first DE job, been here for a year, working for a company who hasn't had someone whose title was DE before. There were lots of people doing small scale data engineering type tasks using a variety of no-code tools, but no one was writing custom pipelines or working with a data warehouse. I basically set up our snowflake database, ETL pipelines, and a few high impact dashboards. The situation was such that even as a relative beginner there was low-hanging fruit where I could make a big impact.\n\nWhen I was getting hired, it seemed like they were taking a chance on me as an individual but also 'data engineering' as a concept, they didn't really know if they 'needed it'. I think partly because of this, and partly because I was just out of school, my compensation is pretty low for a DE at 72k (living in a US city but not a major coastal city).\n\nBut, there are good benefits, I haven't needed to work more than 40 hours more than two or three times, and I feel like the work is interesting. I'm also able to learn on the job because I'm pretty much defining/inventing the tech stack as I go. There is a source of tension though where it feels like no one really understands when I do something innovative or creative to solve a problem, and because of that sometimes it feels like timelines/expectations are expressed with no knowledge of what goes into my work which can be a little frustrating. But, to be fair nothing ever really happens when a timeline is missed.\n\nMy hunch is that if I asked for a raise it would be denied since they seem to be under the impression anyone with a basic data engineering related education could take my place. IMO, if someone tried to take my place there would be a months-long learning process about the business and all the data relationships before they could support existing work let alone produce more.\n\nAnyway, just curious if this seems like I'm hoping for too much? I'm happy overall, but don't know if I am just being naive and should be getting more in terms of recognition, money, opportunities to advance. What are other people's work experiences like? I have a feeling people make more than me by a lot but I don't know if that comes with more stress too.\n\n  \nTLDR: I'm getting paid 72k with, working 40 hours a week, good benefits, not a ton of stress, 1 year of full time DE experience, should I be looking for more?",

This is quite exciting, but also I'm not so experienced to be confident about my choices here, so would really use your advice :).\n\nI need to build a system that will run multiple pipelines that will be ingesting data from various sources (MS SQL databases, API, Splunk etc.) to one MS SQL database. I'm thinking about going with the setup suggested in the title - using DLTHub for ingestion pipelines, DBT or SQLMesh for transforming data in the database and Airflow to schedule this. Is this generally speaking a good direction?\n\nFor some more context:  \n\\- for now the volume of the data is quite low and the frequency of the ingestion is daily at most;  \n\\- I need a strong focus on security and privacy due to the nature of the data;  \n\\- I'm sitting on Azure.\n\nAnd lastly a specific technical question, as I started to implement this solution locally - does anyone have experience with running dlt on Airflow? What's the optimal way to structure the credentials for connections there? For now I specified them in Airflow connections, but then in each Airflow task I need to pull the credentials from the connections and pass them to dlt source and destination, which doesn't make much sense. What's the better option?\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "Hi there,\n\nmy company recently decided to use Apache Kafka to share data among feature \nteams and analytics. Most of the topics are in Avro format. The Kafka cluster\nis provided by an external company, which also has a UI to see some data and\nsome metrics.\n\nNow, the more topics we have, the more our devs want to debug certain things and analytics people want to explore data. \nSo the ui technically allows that, but search for a specific message is not \npossible. We have now explored other methods to do \"data exploration\":\n\n\n* Flink -> too complicated and too much overhead\n* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Json) fails to properly deserialize logicalType \"decimal\" (wtf?)\n* Kafka Connect (Avro -> Parquet) can handle decimals, but ignores tombstones (wtf?)\n* besides: Kafka Connect means, having an immutable copy of the topic - probably not a good idea anyways\n* we are using AWS, so Athena provides a Kafka Connector. Implementation and \nconfiguration is so hacky. It cannot even connect to our Schema registry and \nrequires to have a copy of the schema in Glue (wtf?)\n* Trino's Kafka Connector works surprisingly good, but has the same issue with decimals.\n\nFor you Kafka users out there, do you have the same issues? I was a bit \nsurprised having these kinds of issues with a technology that is that mature \nand widely adopted. \nAny tool suggestions? Is everyone using Json as a topic \nformat? Is it the same with ProtoBuf?\n\nA little side rant: I was writing a consumer in python, which should write the \ndata as parquet files. Getting data from Avro+AvroSchema into a Arrow table, \nwhile using the provided schema is also rather complicated. Both Avro and Arrow \nare big Apache projects. I was expecting some interoperability. I know that the \nArrow Java Implementation, can , supposedly,  deserialize Avro directly into \nArrow. But not the C/Python Implementation.\n\n",

        "author": "sanjayio",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hello Data Engineers 👋\n\nI've been scouting on the internet for the best and easiest way to setup **dbt Core 1.9.0 with Airflow 3.0** orchestration. I've followed through many tutorials, and most of them don't work out of the box, require fixes or version downgrades, and are broken with recent updates to Airflow and dbt.\n\nI'm here on a mission to find and document the best and easiest way for Data Engineers to run their dbt Core jobs using Airflow, that will simply **work out of the box**. \n\n**Disclaimer**: This tutorial is designed with a Postgres backend to work out of the box. But you can change the backend to any supported backend of your choice with little effort.\n\nSo let's get started. \n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Docker desktop (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)\n- Python 3.12 or higher (https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n- Code repo (https://dbtengineer.com/airflow-with-dbt-core-tutorial/#code-repo-video-tutorial)\n\n## Video Tutorial\n\n{% embed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUfYuMjHQCc&ab_channel=DbtEngineer %}\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Clone the repo in prerequisites. \n2. Create a data folder in the root folder on your local.\n3. Rename `.env-example` to `.env` and create new values for all missing values. Instructions to create the fernet key at the end of this Readme.\n4. Rename `airflow_settings-example.yaml` to `airflow_settings.yaml` and use the values you created in `.env` to fill missing values in `airflow_settings.yaml`.\n5. Rename `servers-example.json` to `servers.json` and update the host and username values to the values you set above.\n\n## Running Airflow Locally\n\n1. Run `docker compose up` and wait for containers to spin up. This could take a while.\n2. Access pgAdmin web interface at [localhost:16543](http://localhost:16543). Create a public database under the postgres server.\n3. Access Airflow web interface at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Trigger the dag.\n\n## Running dbt Core Locally\n\nCreate a virtual env for installing dbt core\n\n```sh\npython3 -m venv dbt_venv\nsource dbt_venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nOptional, to create an alias\n\n```sh\nalias env_dbt='source dbt_venv/bin/activate'\n```\n\nInstall dbt Core\n\n```sh\npython -m pip install dbt-core dbt-postgres\n```\n\nVerify Installation\n\n```sh\ndbt --version\n```\n\nCreate a `profile.yml` file in your `/Users/<yourusernamehere>/.dbt` directory and add the following content. \n\n```yaml\ndefault:\n  target: dev\n  outputs:\n    dev:\n      type: postgres\n      host: localhost\n      port: 5432\n      user: your-postgres-username-here\n      password: your-postgres-password-here\n      dbname: public\n      schema: public\n```\n\nYou can now run dbt commands from the dbt directory inside the repo.\n\n```sh\ncd dbt/hello_world\ndbt compile\n```\n\n## Cleanup\n\nRun `Ctrl + C` or `Cmd + C` to stop containers, and then `docker compose down`.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Generating fernet key\n\n```sh\npython3 -c \"from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())\"\n```\n\nI hope this tutorial was useful. Let me know your thoughts and questions in the comments section. \n\nHappy Coding!",

I don't know if I am doing things the right way. But my use case is to generate vector embeddings for one of the `string` columns (say `a`) in my DataFrame. I also have another vector embedding for a `blacklist`.\n\nNow, I when I am generating vector embeddings for `a` I first filter out nulls and certain useless records and generate the embeddings for the remaining of them (say `b`).  Then I do a cosine similarity between the embeddings in `b` and `blacklist`. Then I only keep the records with the max similarity.

Our billing team has built a huge internal system that pulls data from various databases and ultimately generates invoice PDFs. Over time, it's become a very complex structure with dozens of Excel sheets, formulas, macros, and calculations.\n\nThe process often feels clunky and inefficient, especially because a lot of data still has to be copy-pasted manually between files.\n\nSome people have suggested rebuilding the whole system in Python, but I think that’s overkill for our needs, and we don’t have a large enough IT/dev team to maintain something like that.\n\nHowever, we do have a few strong data science people on the team, and I’ve been wondering if this could be a good case for Microsoft Fabric.\n\nCould we use Fabric to build a large data lake of all our datasets?\n\nHow would we keep these datasets updated in near real-time to avoid all the manual copy-pasting?\n\nCan Fabric somehow \"host\" the existing Excel logic, or would it be better to use Fabric to clean and prepare the data, and then keep the final invoicing logic in Excel?\n\n\nThe Excel-based system does work, but it's fragile and hard to maintain. We’re looking for ways to simplify data preparation, automate more of the process, and reduce errors.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts or if anyone has gone through something similar!\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently joined a new company and started this week. My first assigned task is optimizing an existing pipeline that the team has been using. However, the pipeline requires significant work.\n\nThis team hasn’t had a dedicated data professional before, so they outsourced pipeline development to an offshore team. Upon reviewing the pipeline, I was shocked. There’s zero documentation, no helpful comments or method signatures, and even variable declarations are riddled with errors (e.g., indexes spelled as indekes). The function and class naming conventions are also poor. While I haven’t done extensive data engineering work before, I’m certain these are subpar coding practices. It seems the offshore team got away with this because no one technical was overseeing the work. The pipeline has broken frequently in the past, and instead of proper fixes, it’s been patched with band-aid solutions when what it really needs is a complete overhaul.\n\n# The Core Problem:\n\nThe team wants a unified database where each customer has a unique primary key. However:\n\n* Data comes from 5-6 sources, none of which have primary keys for joining.\n* PII (and other details) for the same customer can differ across sources.\n* The goal is to deduplicate and unify all customer records under a single ID.\n\nI’m considering fuzzy matching, but with \\~1M rows, pairwise comparisons are computationally expensive. The offshore team attempted a workaround:\n\n1. **Blocking:** Grouping potentially similar records (name variants, emails and phone numbers) to reduce comparison scope.\n2. **Similarity Scoring:** Running comparisons only within these blocks.\n\nI had some questions\n\n1. Is there a better approach? Have you worked on similar problems? Any recommended tools/strategies?\n2. Learning resources? I’m relatively new to data engineering and want to do this right. Any books, papers, or guides on large-scale deduplication?\n\nThis is a critical project, and I’d appreciate any advice whether technical, procedural, or even just moral support! Thanks in advance, and feel free to ask follow-up questions.",

In the past, we have created or updated tables, views, etc. manually. This leads to some potential issues:\n\n* Sometimes, we will make an update in prod but not in non-prod, leading to our environments being out of sync.\n* Sometimes, we forget to check the changes into source control, so the artifact in production is not properly documented in source control.\n\nWhat tools have you worked with for managing things like this? Ideally, I'd like to check table/view updates into source control, then run a deployment job to make consistent changes in all environments. I'm just curious how other teams have managed this, and what systems have worked well or not worked well for you.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I'm working on a POC using Snowflake as our data warehouse and trying to keep the architecture as simple as possible, while still being able to support our business needs. I’d love to get your thoughts, since this is our first time migrating to a modern data stack.\n\nThe idea is to use Snowpipes to load data into Snowflake from ADLS Gen2, where we land all our raw data. From there, we want to leverage dynamic tables to simplify orchestration and transformation. We’re only dealing with batch data for now so no streaming requirements.\n\nFor CI/CD, we’re planning to use either Azure DevOps or GitHub, using the Snowflake repository stage and we currently have three separate Snowflake accounts, so zero-copy cloning won’t be an option.\n\nThe files in ADLS will contain all columns from the source systems, but in Snowflake we’ll only keep the ones we actually need for reporting. Finally, for slowly changing dimensions, we're planning to use integer surrogate keys instead of hash keys.\n\nDo you think this setup is sufficient? I’m also considering using dbt, mainly for data quality testing and documentation. Since lineage is already available in Snowflake and we’re handling CI/CD externally, I'm wondering if there are still strong reasons to bring dbt into the stack. Any downsides or things I should keep in mind?\n\nAlso, I’m a bit concerned about orchestration. Without using a dedicated tool, we’re relying on dynamic tables and possibly Snowflake Tasks, but that doesn’t feel quite scalable long-term especially when it comes to backfills or more complex dependencies.\n\nSorry for the long post but any feedback would be super helpful!",

        "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nmy org, and my project specifically is based on the GCP. We do have Airflow on the Composer, in which we have the 'smtp\\_default' connection setup which is authenticated through simple login/password, so that we can send email from our Microsoft Outlook app email account during some failures/retries or other use cases.\n\nHowever, Microsoft is retiring basic auth and will \"force\" to use oauth: [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/exchange-online-to-retire-basic-auth-for-client-submission-smtp-auth/4114750](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/exchange-online-to-retire-basic-auth-for-client-submission-smtp-auth/4114750)\n\nThe problem is, if I got it correctly, Airflow SMTP does not support oauth:  \n[https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/51094](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/51094)  \n[https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/32834](https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/32834)\n\nNow, I am wondering, how should I tackle this to still be able to use the SMTP option. We use airflow version 2.10.2.\n\nI tried to do my research both in web and with the AI support, and the suggestion was to go with \"Custom Email Backend in Airflow\", meaning to replace the`airflow.utils.email.send_email_smtp`with  my own  function that handles OAuth2.\n\nI have created this post because I am looking for advice and some sort of validation whether it is really the best approach, considering the scenario that we would need to still use the Microsoft Office account (and not e.g. gmail). I would really like to make sure that the transition/changes we will be implementing are not in fact introducing some anti-patterns...   \nIs there any better/more clean way of tackling it?  \n  \nThanks!

So this won't work.\n* Row filtering is a feature in Fivetran, but only for database sources, not for Qualtrics.\n\nI'm thinking we'd need to dump all of the data into our own destination first and then sync across the filtered data to their lake...I suppose this will work, but I'm just looking for ideas in case I can avoid the multi step process.",

But I can see both the embeddings API and re-ranker are getting called when I use the tool, so it seems to be \"working\" at the most basic level.\n\nBut man, it's next to useless.\n\nIs this what you all tend to see with these \"do retrieval on your codebase\" tools?  \n\nAnd I realize it's only good for certain things, and a bad prompt will mean bad result, and sometimes cntl-f is what you really want, but it just seem so bad even when my question/prompt is pretty specific about things I know are verbatim in the codebase mutiple places.",

        "content": "Hey, I would just like to open by saying this post is extremely biased and selfish in nature. Now with that in mind, I work at a bank as a Student Data Engineer while doing an Msc in Data Engineering.\n\nMy team consists of my supervisor and myself. He is a Data Analyst that doesn't have much technical expertise (just some Python and SQL knowledge but for doing basic things).\n\nWe handle data at a monthly granularity level. When I was brought in 11 months ago, the needs weren't well defined (in fact they weren't defined at all). Since then, we've been slowly gaining more clarity. Our work now mainly consists of exporting data from SAP Business Objects, doing Extract-Transform in Python and exporting aggregates (typed cleansed joined data). This is in fact what I did. He then uses the aggregates to do some dashboarding in Excel. Now he started using Power BI for dashboarding.\n\nI suggested moving to an Airbyte->DW->DBT ELT pipeline. I'm implementing a POC for this purpose. But my supervisor asked if it would be better to use Alteryx as an ETL tool instead. His motives are that he wants us to remain a business oriented team not a technical one that implements and maintains technical solutions, another motive of his is that the data isn't voluminous enough to warrant the approach I suggested (Most of our source excel files are less than 100k rows with one being less than 150k rows and another being at more than 1.5M rows)\n\nMy motives on the other hand are why I said this post is selfish. I plan to use this as a Final Year Project. And, I feel like this would advance my career (improve my CV) better than Alteryx which I feel is more targeted towards Data Analysts who like Drag-and-Drop UIs and no code quality of life approaches.\n\nOne point I know my approach beats out Alteryx in is auditability. It is important to document the transformations our data goes through and I feel that that is more easily done and ensured with my approach.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1. Am I too selfish in what I'm doing or is it ok (considering I'm going to soon be freshly graduated and really want to be able to show this 14 month long experience as genuine, real work that will be relevant to the type of positions I would be targeting) ?\n2. How do I convince my supervisor of my approach ?",

        "content": "Hi. This is purely a pedantic question, with no practical impact on what is being developed. But still curiosity may lead to some fruitful discussion.\n\nWe have a typical data pipeline, where some data are going to go daily through a series of transformations, and finally written into a unified database schema. \n\nNow, for most cases, the source and destination/sink of that data is on the same database instance. Therefore, what we can do, is to just run everything a sequence of SQL statements (`INSERT INTO T(n+1).... SELECT ... FROM Tn` etc), without actually \"loading\" any data into our server. So all data stays in teh database server and transformed there. It has the huge benefit that we don't have to deal with partitioning, distribution etc. \n\nSo, it's quite clear to me that it's not ETL since we don't extract data into our data processing server and then transform it (or not?). But is it ELT indeed, given that we do not leave the transformation for after loading the data, and we do not store raw data (well we do, but only as T0 to feed our pipeline). Is it neither of them, or some other Jargon I don't know about? ",

Stretching on the is good?\n\nHi everyone,\n\nMy wife and I live in the SF Bay Area. She grew up in Middle East and moved here after our marriage. Back there, she worked for one of the top employers, but here she’s struggling to get calls from tier 1 (FAANG) or tier 2 (just below FAANG) companies — or sometimes even tier 3.\n\nShe has a BS in Computer Science and currently  a senior data analyst. She’s genuinely smart and extremely good at what she does — honestly, she’s smarter than me in most ways!\n\nShe wants to move from data analytics into data engineering, but as you all know, the required skill sets are different — pipelines, cloud, distributed systems, ETL frameworks, etc.\n\nHere’s where we differ: I came to the US for my master’s and I’m more of a hustler. I stretch my skills a lot to match the job description — for example, I highlight skills I may not be an expert in but know enough to talk about, just to get calls and clear interviews. Then I prep like crazy to bridge any gaps. She, on the other hand, doesn’t want to do that — she feels it’s dishonest and wants to break in purely on what she’s actually done.\n\nSo my question is: what’s the best honest path for her to break into a tier 1 or tier 2 company as a data engineer? Can anyone tell her it’s good to stretch the skill sets\n\nIf anyone here has made this switch (without a US degree), we’d love to hear how you did it. Any advice, resources, or realistic tips to help her get her foot in the door in tier1 or tier2 companies with or without lying on her would mean a lot.\n\nThanks so much in advance!",

        "author": "Away-Violinist3104",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey folks – my friend and I have been thinking a lot about the communication overhead between business stakeholders and data engineers when it comes to building data pipelines. From what we observe at our job and further validated by chatting with a couple friends in data engineering space, a lot of time is spent just getting alignment – business users describing what they want, engineers trying to translate that into something technically feasible, and a lot of back-and-forth when things aren’t clear.\n\nWe’re exploring whether it’s possible to reduce this overhead with a self-service tool powered by an “AI data engineer” agent. The idea is:\n\n* Business users specify what they want (e.g., “I need a dashboard showing X broken down by Y every week”).\n* The AI agent builds the pipeline using the existing data stack.\n* If there's any ambiguity or missing context, it prompts the user for feedback. If they don’t know the answer, they can loop in a technical person, all in the same tool. Technical/data team can provide necessary context so the agent can carry forward.\n* After getting clarification, the agent continues building the pipeline.\n* Once the pipeline is built, technical/data team verify, review, edit or approve \n\nThis way, non-technical users could handle more of the work themselves, and engineers can focus on higher-leverage tasks instead of ad-hoc asks.\n\nWe’re super early ideation and trying to understand if this is actually a real pain point for others – or if it’s already solved well enough with existing tools, or is it just another \"imagined problem\".\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts:\n\n* Do you run into this communication gap in your org?\n* Would something like this be useful, or would it just add noise?\n* Are there any tools out there that already handle this well?\n\nAny perspectives would be appreciated!",

Their inventory data was spread across 3 different databases, production schedules were in Excel sheets that people were emailing around, and quality control metrics were...well, let's just say they existed somewhere.\n\nThe real kicker? Leadership kept asking for \"real-time visibility\" into operations while we are sitting on data that's 2-3 days old by the time anyone sees it. Classic, right?\n\n**The main headaches we ran into:**\n\n* ERP system from early 2000s that basically spoke a different language than everything else\n* No standardized data formats between production, inventory, and quality systems\n* Manual processes everywhere where people were literally copy-pasting between systems\n* Zero version control on critical reports (nightmare fuel)\n* Compliance requirements that made everything 10x more complex\n\n**What broke during migration:**\n\n* Initial pipeline kept timing out on large historical data loads\n* Real-time dashboards were too slow because we tried to query everything live\n\n**What actually worked:**\n\n* Staged approach with data lake storage first\n* Batch processing for historical data, streaming for new stuff\n\nWe ended up going with Azure for the modernization but honestly the technical stack was the easy part. The real challenge was getting buy-in from operators who have been doing things the same way for 15+ years.\n\n**What I am curious about:** For those who have done similar manufacturing data consolidations, how did you handle the change management aspect? Did you do a big bang migration or phase it out gradually?\n\nAlso, anyone have experience with real-time analytics in manufacturing environments? We are looking at implementing live dashboards but worried about the performance impact on production systems.\n\nWe actually documented the whole journey in a whitepaper if anyone's interested. It covers the technical architecture, implementation challenges, and results. Happy to share if it helps others avoid some of the pitfalls we hit.",

        "content": "I am considering database CI/CD frameworks for a long term project to handle database evolution eloquently. At my place of work, it's pretty common to just spin up at a database and have an admin make ad-hoc changes to create/modify users, permissions, schemas, tables, etc. (if you're lucky, they commit those changes to a repo). This generally doesn't pose any issues when we expect the life-cycle of the project to be a matter of months-- and it helps us move quick when we have a crunched deadline and a smallish team, reduces overhead/red tape, but scrappy. For reference, these are generally analytic databases, not hooked up to any downstream application, save for a dashboard here or there. Our products are generally processed data itself or research derived from that data. \n\nThe downsides to this scrappy database approach is the one prod environment can become messy, the admin might not always remember to commit ddl changes to version control, and if a dev is creating stored procs or something, that is likely going to fly under the radar of source/version control. Ultimately it can become hard to maintain and hard to appropriately gatekeep and record what changes are made when. \n\nSo I come with a question for those of you that use flyway, liquibase, atlas, dbmate or any similar tools: How has it made your life easier/harder? How do you get buy-in from your teams? Feel free to note anything else about using these tools that feels relevant. ",

Also, I want to ditch ops for this simple task as much as I can.\n\nMy experiences so far are:\n\n* Kafka -> DataLakeGen2 connector to data lake -> COPY INTO in databricks => works but the connector is always messages behind, also, I would like to avoid this\n* Kafka -> Azure Stream Analytics -> Delta table in data lake => works but we have some very long watermark delays in some messages and cannot figure out why (seems to be related to the low volumne)\n* Kafka -> Spark Streaming in databricks => works, but is expensive\n* Kafka -> Fabric eventstreams -> lakehouse (maybe shortcut)? => would work but I do not want to use Fabric\n* Kafka -> Iceberg Sink Connector (managed in Confluent Cloud) => I have not managed to set it up for azure\n\nWhat I have not checked in detail:\n\n* Estuary Flow (might be good but 3rd party service)\n* Fivetran (same as with estuary flow, but has longer delays)\n* Confluent Tableflow would be perfect but they will roll it out too late\n* Flink => too much maintenance, I guess\n\nThanks for your input",

Some dummies need to study English rather than digital electronics.\n\n\nI just want to share my humble opinion from what I saw and experienced. This post may not be suitable for complete beginners. I assume that you already know DS&A and can build something at least in two different languages.\n\nI see so many questions, not only in this subreddit but generally on the web, like \"which language should I choose/is good to start/should I learn,\" etc. I think this is kind of missing the idea of \"software engineering\" or development.\n\nI bet most of us were stuck in \"language hell\" before. What should I learn? C? C++? Java? Fortran? Cobol? PL/I? Python? Rust? You can extend this list.\n\nLanguage is usually the easiest part of programming. Because in 2025, you can just open Google and type \"xyz language syntax/libraries,\" and then you get a kabillion resources about it.\n\nIf language were that important, I bet most of the computer science classes would focus on low or mid-level languages like Assembly or C and similar languages.\n\nSo you (we) should focus on technology rather than the syntax. You should focus on \"how can I store/manipulate/transmit this digital data more efficiently?\"\n\nWhen you list your languages in your CV like this:\n\n* C & C++\n* Java\n* Python\n* Haskell\n* Verilog\n* so on\n\nyes, it shows something but not everything or big picture. It is still too abstract and does not answer \"Are you capable of using the [ARINC 429](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_429) standard to transfer encrypted data?\" or \"Which boards did you work on?\" or \"Have you deployed a containerized microservice on Kubernetes with Helm charts?\" or \"Can you deploy a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins?\"\n\nThe other issue that occurs due to focusing on languages too much is that you do not know how you should create your portfolio. Since you focused on the language, you are hanging around basic implementations like a calculator, simple USB driver, or an asynchronous web page, etc.\n\nThe more experienced programmers would notice that I am pointing out the \"specialization.\"  \nLet's be honest, in 2025, industries do not need too many juniors.\n\nSo rather than obsessing about languages, explore the telecommunication standards, protocols, and preferred [software architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_architecture_styles_and_patterns) and technologies you’ll actually use in your target industry, then build projects around those. This approach will teach you the necessary language and engineering skills at the same time.",

Like, what made the switch from “I’m just reading stuff” to “I actually understand what I’m doing”?\n\nMost advice out there is the same laundry list: spaced repetition, Pomodoro, flashcards, blah blah. But I’m way more curious about how people landed on what works for them. Did you start by failing a lot and then tweaking your method? Copy a YouTuber’s setup and slowly ditch most of it? Realize that everything falls apart after 3 p.m. so you built your schedule around that?\n\nI think a lot of us, especially in programming, go through that phase where we’re doing tutorials on autopilot, feeling like we’re learning, but nothing sticks. Then something clicks. Maybe it's building your own project, maybe it's just doing spaced recall the right way, or realizing that you need to write code, not just watch it being written.\n\nPersonally, I used to grind tutorial after tutorial thinking I was improving, but I couldn’t build anything from scratch. Only after I started using flashcards and forcing myself to explain stuff in my own words did things actually start sticking.\n\nAnyway, I’d love to hear what your turning point was.

        "content": "tl;dr feel burnt out, and trouble focusing, self-studying at 30\n\nHey all, im self-taught mostly over the past 4 years. I've learnt a lot mostly on random topics etc. At first i was just doing it as a side-thing in case i *enjoyed it*. \n\nAnd i quickly found i did, i loved to create and solve problems, research, debug and refactor, the whole lot. \n\nThe issue was, i never planned to go to University/College. I didn't think the career path would be for me. \n\nUntil recently (earlier this year) when i began to actively try and get a job (which is almost impossible for me). \n\nSo i decided while i wait, i study core compsci topics that i missed out.\n\nI did a bit of random study all over the place (like with roadmap.sh and random lectures/tutorials). \n\nUntil i heard of OSSU. \n\nIt's great... but at the same time, my attention is just so lacking at my age, i feel like 10+ years ago i would have loved studying like this, but now? It feels so tiresome and tiring. \n\nIt probably doesn't help that\n\n 1. I'm cramming as much as i can\n2. The topics so far are all things I've already learnt. \n\nBut i just really want to be able to say \"Hey, i know i dont have a degree, but i did this online pathway!\"\n\nThere are many reasons i initially didn't go for a degree (health and finances being the main two). But now I'm kinda glad i didnt? I don't know if i could have dredged on for 4 years like this, i very much just want the next 6-12months to fly by (my estimated finish time for OSSU). So that i can just focus on increasing my portfolio.\n\nBut yeah, wondering if anyone has been in the same boat? Studying later in life.",

I don’t have a job, I’m not working in any company, and this project meant the world to me.\n\nRight now, I feel lost and defeated.  \nI feel like I lost my motivation and passion completely.\n\nPlease...

Along with this I am also studying nextjs for SEO which react lacks in. \n\nIt feels like I have put so much effort into learning all this because I know a lot of people who don’t even code outside uni despite having a passion for cs. But at the same time there are students who I work with at uni who feel so much more ahead of me and much more prepared for this industry. Yes I know comparison is the theft of joy. But I feel like it’s just unavoidable. \n\nAt the same time with all the LLMs going around and vibe coding, I see students who vibe code websites under a day which would take me at least a few days to create all while them not even having a grasp of what the code is about. So it really defeats the purpose of putting all that effort into studying all that. \n\nWhat would you do this in my situation? I genuinely have an interest for software dev and don’t want to switch careers this late. \n",

My issue is that I can’t seem to decide on one. I enjoy working with all of them, and whenever I spend a few hours coding in one language, I get the urge to switch to another cool language. Right now, I’ve got my eye on C++.\n\nI’m not sure where I want to go professionally, which makes it hard for me to choose a language, since I can’t even decide on a specific field.\n\nI find embedded systems and backend/cloud very exciting. ML also seems interesting, but probably involves too much math (I do like math, but I probably do not like it enough for that).\n\nIs there anyone here who has been in a similar situation?  \nI’m not switching languages because I find them hard or don’t enjoy them. I love them all — and hate myself for it :(\n\nEvery field and language I’ve explored is exciting to me. But now that I’m close to finishing my bachelor’s degree, I feel like I’m wasting time by constantly switching between them.\n\nI jump from one thing to another so often that I end up feeling paralyzed when it comes to making a decision — and in the end, I barely get around to actually coding anymore.",

        "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI've been on reddit for a while, mostly just reading and learning from other people's stories. But now, I finally decided to write my own post to share my journey and ask for some honest advice about my career path. **If you've been through something similar or just want to share your stories, I'd really appreciate it.**\n\n**Warning: wall of text.**\n\nI graduated in 2018 with a degree in Software Engineering from a university (not top tier). The program was mostly practical, not too much theory. At that time, the job market in tech was really good.\n\nI started working at a few software outsourcing companies, focused on web dev. Because of the nature of the projects, I had to work with many different technologies. I think this is one of the biggest differences between outsourcing companies and product companies. I didn't get a chance to go deep into any technology, as soon as I started to get familiar with something, I had to switch to something else.\n\nAlso, many of my friends were working at big companies and making a lot of money. That made me feel peer-pressured and pushed me to switch jobs often, chasing better pay, even though my skills weren't really strong enough to match those expectations.\n\nOver time, I started feeling lost and didn't know what I was working toward anymore. I also started to lose motivation, so I made a big decision to go study abroad for 2 years, hoping to find a new direction and more opportunities. I guess this is another big mistake that I made.\n\nWith how tough the job market is right now, I've spent long time doing self-reflection. I realized that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Sometimes we don't appreciate what we already have until it's gone. And I've learned that success takes real effort and time, there are no shortcuts. If I had worked continuously since graduation, I would have over 7 YOE by now, but because of many breaks and job changes, I still feel like I'm only at a mid-level, not senior yet. I'm still afraid to apply for senior roles.",

I finally built a project I was proud of and showed it to my cousin who’s a professional developer.\n\nHe looked at it and immediately pointed out a bunch of flaws and problems—some I didn’t even know were things. Stuff like accessibility issues, poor structure, responsiveness problems, and things I wouldn’t have even considered. Basically, he made me realize that what I thought was a solid project is actually super basic and kinda bare bones.\n\nI asked him if I should start learning backend next, and he told me straight up: “You’ve barely scratched the surface of front-end.” That hit hard.\n\nNow I’m feeling kinda crushed. Like, if this is considered basic, what the hell have I even accomplished? I thought I was making real progress.\n\nCollege is starting soon and I’ll only be able to put in like 1–2 hours a day instead of the 5 I’m doing now. So the real question is: is it even worth continuing this journey if my progress is this slow and my work still sucks?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who's been through this. ",

        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "As the title states, I would call myself a C++ programmer because it’s the main language I use.  Of course, there are others I use, like C, Java, TS, python, etc.  but I have stuck to C++ for so long because after graduating (I’m in my final year of CS bachelors), I want to work in systems programming/high performance systems programming (particularly computer graphics).  As such, I’ve spent the most time with C++, especially with graphics because that is so far my favorite area of CS and C++ is built for such high performance yet complex applications like game engines and has very good support for OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, GLFW, GLM, etc.  \n\nBut, even after 5 years of time spent, every time I start up a big project I get super bummed out because my code looks nothing like other folks code bases.  Or I’ll end up watching some CPP con talk where the speaker essentially says everything I’m doing is wrong.  Even going through the r/CPP subreddit (a great subreddit, no hate), it just seems like my code is way too archaic and I just don’t get it.  No matter how much I try to modularize and use professional OOP principles in my programs, it just doesn’t ever look right and leads to essentially a more procedural approach which seems to be looked down upon by most C++ programmers.\n\nOf course, this imposter syndrome leads me to quit projects and rage delete everything that I’m working on.  My GitHub went from 20 projects to about 2 because of how much I hated all my stuff.  I just don’t have this issue with other languages either; for the most part with C, Java, Rust, etc. there is an intuitive way of doing things but with C++ it drives me insane because I have no idea the right way to do things when there’s so much stuff.  But there’s not much other choice when it comes to computer graphics because it seems that C++ is the primary language for that kind of stuff so I just have to deal with it\n\nSo is this a normal feeling? Should I continue with C++ or should I maybe get better at using another language and then applying what i learn from other languages to C++? Or is there a good alternative to C++?",

        "author": "franzz4",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "So, I started learning programming last December with Python. Since then, I’ve studied several programming languages like C, Rust, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Flutter (Dart). I tried out different languages used in different areas, such as back-end (C, Rust, Python, and JavaScript), front-end (HTML/CSS and JavaScript), and mobile (Kotlin and Flutter). After testing several different areas, here’s the conclusion I came to:\n\n**Front-end and Mobile:** It’s fun and interesting, but I don’t really see myself working professionally with UI — only in personal projects. The languages are manageable, but the problem is that there are thousands of frameworks that do the same thing, and the job market expects you to know several (especially in Web). In the end, it’s hard to pick one to focus on and really master.\n\n**Back-end:** I found it really fun to work with connections, APIs, databases, JSON, and making the project work behind the scenes. The languages are good (some are hard), and there are several options as well. However, it’s easier to pick one or two languages to specialize in back-end than it is in front-end. That’s why I decided to focus on back-end.\n\nAfter learning the basics of programming, like: programming logic, algorithms, data structures, and Git/GitHub, I’d like to ask for your opinion — **which language do you recommend I focus on right now?**  \nFrom what I’ve seen, the most recommended ones are:\n\n* Python\n* Java\n* C#\n* Go\n* Rust\n\nI was thinking about going back to Python and Rust since I already have some background with them, but I’d love to hear your opinions.",

(although text is preferred)\n\nI don't mind if it starts from the basics, that would be fine as a little refresher and to see what java does differently than other languages, I can always skip what I already know.\n\nAlso its a small annoyance, not really a problem, but I don't like sites that offer free resources or tutorials and stuff but then force you to create an account. Although if its worth it for what they offer and they have good resources that's fine, but I just don't like having to create 5 different accounts for a bunch of different services.  \n\n\nI know its unlikely anyone will know it but a while ago (might have been on a different subreddit) there was someone who posted a website they were making to teach others java and it was pretty nice, plain text, some examples with syntax highlighting, but no adds or images that I had noticed, just text.\n\nIf anyone happens to know remember the site it would be neat if you could comment the link thanks.\n\n\nEdit: \njust as context for the type of site I would (ideally) like to look for.

And from that backend (let's say it's hosted for free on Vercel), I should be able to make automatic daily API calls with a cron job and store that data on a database that can be used whenever I make a request from my frontend? \n\nSo in short, I'm just trying to wrap my head around the front end back end interaction. From my understanding, it's basically: Github Front End HTTP request to Back End hosted not on github, then the backend sends back some queried data from the database that is automatically updating every day?\n\n",

I can make APIs and I understand HTTP to a good extent and all that stuff, I can make CRUD APIs if I wanted. But I also have this itch to make more complex projects, things that will teach me more than just language or library features. For example, I want to try to make a mini Express.js with the Node HTTP module, but when I try to think of how I would even start this project my mind just goes blank. I feel like I should know this, but I don't.\n\nI've been building APIs in raw Node.js, so I think I should at least be able to come up with some sort of abstraction around the HTTP module, kind of like what express does with app.get() and more. But for some reason, I can't. It's like I can understand HTTP, custom middleware, routing, and serving static files, but when I want to make something a step-up from basic CRUD APIs, I feel like I'm back to square one and I actually haven't learned anything. And it isn't just about this project, it's in general. For example, if I go to the \"Project based learning\" github repo and check out the Node section, it says things like \"Build a real-time Markdown editor in Node.js\", \"build a web framework\", \"build a real-time serverless GraphQL API with WebSockets on AWS\". I feel like I should maybe have SOME idea as to what things I would need to do, but I can't even think of one and if I do then I'll realize it's not a perfect solution and then I have to go back and think about it.

I don’t know how to reframe my skills, or even what I’m qualified for outside of coding all day. Starting over is scary, and I don’t know where to begin.\n\nHave any of you made a big pivot after burnout or layoffs? What roles still leverage your technical background, but offer something more sustainable, more human? I’m looking at things like solutions architecture or tech-focused product roles, but I’m open to anything that doesn’t suck the life out of me again.",

I wasn’t trying to sell myself or anything, just being myself. It kind of made me realise that whole saying about \"it's who you know\" might actually be true.\n\nCurious what others think about that.

I am not new to this field and even with that I am just tired of this field.\n\nI felt it might get better, but I feel it has only gotten worse. Started in this field a little before COVID hit and heard that is when things started going downhill in this field (outside that window of massive hiring for 1.5 year) around then. My experience backs this.\n\nThe expectations in this field are insane and none of my friends in other fields come close to putting up with this. The interview process is out of control and much of it has nothing to do with on the job stuff. So you have to learn on your own these things to do the interviews. The expectations while you have a job are insane. You are mostly led by non-technical people who fail to grasp how complex what they are asking you to do is and unrealistic deadlines because they are too scared to tell their managers no.\n\nAlso, endless learning new stupid languages and stacks because someone in the world just has to create \"another language\" for their own ego, that ultimately does not make anything easier. Just makes it a new thing you have to learn.\n\nNevermind the horrible job market in tech specifically. Endless layoffs, one of the highest unemployment rates of any white collar job field (we are higher than the average now), and clear attempts to send any new jobs overseas. So you can't even get a chance to compete for those jobs that go abroad.\n\nUltimately I'm just over it. I'm done. I want out. I just don't see a future in this field anymore.\n\nWhat are some realistic paths I can take to get out of this field given my CS degree and experience? I'm ok with going back to school or pay for some training if it means there is a realistic path to getting employment. As long as it won't take more than 2 years. Ideally 1 year. Open to any idea though. I'm ok taking a paycut too, anything in 80k-100k pay range is ok with me.\n\nI'm just over it. What are my options? Does anyone have any suggestions?",

He ended up referring me to a consulting firm. I went through one 30 minutes interview and ended with an offer 30k above my old job. I am genuinely baffled because I feel like I didn't do well in the interview. For months, I spent countless hours tailoring my resume and cover letters for each application to end up with an offer that I didn't even need to formally apply to.

I want to get back into tech, and have been working hard building projects to get to that point. Markets harder than ever though and I think I’m a few months out from having any realistic chance.\n\nI just got a new opportunity in marketing and would be contracted for 2 years. The pay isn’t life changing but it’s almost double what I’m getting paid now. I don’t think I would have any interest in this career path after those 2 years. Would I completely throw out my odds of tech, given I don’t back to college for a masters? Is it any different than where I currently stand at 2 years out.\n\n",

After taking a few months off to work on a passion project, I'm realizing it's likely not going to produce income soon enough for my family, so I'm reentering the salaried job market.\n\nPrior to this I was staff engineer at a public tech company, and prior to that I was CTO of a startup which was acquired by that tech company, so I haven't done any interviewing myself for over 10 years. During that time I would say about half was hands on engineering (coding, submitting or reviewing PRs) and half on architecture/leadership.\n\nIn conversations with recruiters, I have been forthright in my inexperience interviewing, saying things like I don't expect to do well on things like LeetCode interviews. Most of the recruiters I've spoken to say \"oh, we don't do LeetCode interviews here.\" You know, they want to sound _different than the other companies_. However, the very next call I have with the company will be a tech screen where I am asked to do a LeetCode style puzzle, and inevitably I bomb. \n\nThere are many factors here--I am self taught--and I discovered have more test anxiety than I realized. Also, these \"problems\" are often just little puzzles that I've rarely if ever seen in my 25 years of software engineering, so I am simply rusty at solving them in the allotted time. My problem solving may also follow a non-traditional sequence that the interviewer is simply not used to seeing (like, incorrect \"order of operations\" even though I solve the problem).\n\nRegardless of whether the companies are saying they do LeetCode style questions or not, it seems like I have no choice but to grind it out until I can pass these silly interviews. I'm curious if that is what other people are experiencing? Like, there are obviously ways to get much better signal from candidates--and as a hiring manager for many many years I've developed my own preferences--but as a candidate it seems I can't influence the process at all. \n\nI'm curious what the fine folks here would say. Do I just suck it up and grind LC? Have people found success asking for alternative interviews like take-homes, PR reviews, peer coding, etc? Are there companies that I should be looking at? \n\nAnyway, thanks for listening and for any feedback or advice you can offer. Best of luck out there on your interview loops!",

I like my current team, but there is little to no room for growth here.\n\nWhat’s pushing me to seriously consider the offer is that there might very likely be an involuntary layoff coming later and the severance for those is roughly 2 months of salary.\n\nMy main concern is: What if I can’t find a new job within 6 months? The market feels shaky, and I’m not sure how long the job search might take, especially given my relatively short experience.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position? Would you take the package, or is it too risky right now? What factors should I weigh before making a decision?\n\nEdit: If I do take the package, my plan is to grind Leetcode full-time and look for a better role. I’ve already been preparing the last few months after realizing there’s really no path for promotion here and there was already 1 round of layoff happened earlier this year. That said, I’ve been inconsistent due to my full-time workload. Taking the package feels like a rare opportunity to fully focus on job hunting and leveling up, but I’m still nervous about the risk of not landing a new role within 6 months.",

WLB is good but time is tracked so it’s not the kind of place where I can leave early if I’m done. The office is a bland cube farm and much more depressing than the office I saw in my interview. Should I try to get out ASAP or am I just being dramatic?",

        "content": "I'm 48 years old in the USA and wondering if it's too late for a career change. I have been at my very small(less than 20 employees) non-tech company 19 years, and for the last 15 of those years I have been solely responsible for both developing our customer facing applications and managing the infrastructure they run on. I shifted the entire company's tech from a closet in the office to AWS in 2017, and in since then our downtime can be measured in minutes. While our company is tiny, we have several very large clients and the applications I have written(mostly in .NET) have scaled well to their often heavy demands. And I painstakingly migrated a few huge, monolithic [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Web Forms apps to Razor Pages and Blazor. I am also the sole manager of Active Directory, virtual desktops, etc. \n\nThe good: I am fully remote and make $140,000 a year. Because I have the company's tech basically on auto-pilot I might work ten hours in a busy week. I have no deadlines, no one looking over my shoulder, one pointless meeting a week, and if I need to buy something for the company tech-wise no one even notices. I nominally have a boss, but he's in his late 60's and checked out years ago.\n\nThe bad: I made $135,000 before COVID and I don't see that changing any time soon. No raise this year. I receive no benefits, no bonus, no retirement funding beyond my own contributions. I am fortunate that my wife has a good job and great health insurance so that is not a concern. And even though I don't work a ton of hours, I always need to be available because there is no one else but me to answer customer questions or deal with even the most minor of glitches in the system. I haven't had a full work day off in over an year, even on vacation I always have to do something and be available. There is no budget to hire anyone else. Because neither our employees or clients are technically adept all my interactions with them are on the level of helping my Mom print an email.   \n\nI am concerned about the long term viability of this company and bored out of my mind, but who would hire me? I've never worked on a team. I've never managed anyone. I have no idea how \"real\" companies develop production code. I code in Visual Studio, push to Github which kicks off an AWS Codepipeline, done. Nobody checks my work. We don't have budgets. I don't know what a pull request is and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.\n\nI plan to retire by 62 so I know the easy answer is to just ride this out until then but like I said, I don't know that the company will be around that long. So I guess I'm in that phase where I feel too old and outdated to do anything else but still too young to retire... but doing nothing is becoming scarier by the day.",

I graduated last year from a top CS uni in Canada with internships.\n\nThankfully I'm currently employed as a Python developer (backend) at a small company in Canada. By small, think very small. Also, it is not a tech company. A lot of the work I've done both in this job and in my internships is not impressive or exciting. In reality, most of it has been work done on internal tooling or your everyday basic crud app. I haven't worked on complex problems, I haven't ever come across a project that I felt would take a stroke of genius to solve. I'm stagnating, and have been for a while.\n\nThe problem is that I need to make more money. And I don't know where to start. I'm looking for other roles but I'm getting no bites. I'm working on side projects but the things I'm passionate about wouldn't get me hired or paid well. I've done so much Leetcode but I still flop interviews. Hell, I don't even get interviews. But I did flop the ones I got, other than my current job, of course. \n\nNow, the question is this: if I want FAANG to look at my resume a year from now, what do I have to do? Hell, it doesn't even have to be FAANG. Any tech company would be enough. Or even any reputable company even. How can I save myself from being out of a job in a year and having to spend 6 months looking for another one?",

The work is more niche (GPU driver, kernel debugging).\n* Option 2: Higher paid position at a different company where I'd be working on a modern C++ codebase (the company is smaller and isn't as well known but the staff is apparently quite elite). After one year they allow remote work + give a significant raise in salary.\n\nThe key issue here is that the first role is almost exclusively focused on debugging driver/GPU issues and there is little to no implementation to be done. I imagine that I would become something of a linux kernel / GPU driver guru after some time of doing this kind of work.\n\nThe other role pays better (especially after the one year re-negotiation) and allows for remote work but it's more of a regular C++ SWE engineering implementation job, after a year this would be \\~45k euro at google (net of tax) vs \\~75k euro (net of tax) at the other company.\n\nMy two questions to people who have experience in the industry are:\n\n1. Would having google in my CV have a significant impact on my career compared to experience at some other company?\n2. Could doing no implementation and essentially only debugging be dertimental to my engineering skills or actually help me grow? I will add that I already know C++ pretty well so I don't believe I could grow all that much in terms of pure C++ skills.\n\nI would really appreciate some input.",

No complaints there.\n\nBut for real design or new features? It’s like pair programming with an overeager intern who refuses to say “I don’t know.” It’ll confidently scaffold something that compiles but is subtly wrong in ways that bite you later. Error handling missing. Boundaries between services fuzzy. Or it’ll suggest a “quick fix” that completely ignores the ADR you spent two days writing.\n\nIt’s not just that it’s wrong sometimes but it’s that it’s convincingly wrong. Which is worse than useless when you’re moving fast.\n\nI’ve even had to consciously dial back my use of it on one of our event-driven services because I noticed I was rubber-stamping suggestions instead of thinking about the architecture myself. \n\nAnyway just curious if anyone else has had the same arc.

For the past 1.5 years, my old manager asked me to work with another team which is more Data science/Data engineering related. It's more backend and data science-oriented. I didn't have any prior data science experience, but the codebase was manageable, and most of my tasks involved fixing bugs or building straightforward features without  deep DS knowledge.\n\nRecently, my manager asked me if I wanted to change my job title to reflect my current role, I agreed. But to officially \"transfer\", I had to pass a Python coding test. I was surprised since by this point I'd already shipped multiple features, fixed a shit ton of bugs, but went ahead anyway.\n\nThe first test went super badly lol, questions about two-sum, basic string manipulation, pandas, and numpy threw me off. I felt terrible and asked for a retake. I studied pandas thoroughly as that was the one thing I had no experience in, but the second test didn't even have pandas questions, it had a simple fizzbuzz-type problem, some question regarding numpys again (which I got right, but I hadn't converted the original array to np.array, which got me a zero lol), For the fizz buzz type question, I messed up badly by using `if` instead of `elif`.\n\nI asked for one last try. The third test (10) questions were incredilby easy, I thought they felt pity for me lol, then came question 11 and 12, 11 had pass some argument or something to a parser, I honestly didn't even understand the question and 12 had me converting a sentence to numbers, like tokenization. I got the logic right, but couldn't remember the syntax for removing punctuation. Unfortunately, CoderPad doesn't give partial credit, so I failed again. Now I'm seriously doubting my abilities. In my mind, its like I can just look up this information ( syntax about removing punctuation) is it really fair for me to get a zero on this?\n\nEven though my manager has had no complaints and my performance reviews have been good, I'm suddenly experiencing major imposter syndrome. Missing these simple questions is making me spiral. I'm worried that without the title change, I won't get promoted, or worse, might lose my job.\n\nMaybe I'm just venting, but I'm curious if anyone else has experienced something similar. The self-doubt is really impacting my productivity and emotional state\n\nEDIT: My day to day doesn't really involve lot of coding nowadays, its mostly shipping features from existing codebase and just migrating it with some minor adjustments. Fixing bugs and talking with the stakeholders to see what kind of results are they expecting. Even when I do this, I can always test/debug, but its pretty much not possible to debug on the 'coderpad' tests. ",

Behavioral – maybe I can swing because I could relatively easily prepare answers to 10-20 common questions. Though I've not done any super serious practice like mock interviews. Coding? I just have a few weeks of Leetcode practice in total, and just met the bar for the initial coding interview. Not sure I can swing that 2 more times.\n\nI'm debating just going for it or last-minute telling the recruiter that tbh I'm not feeling prepared, apologize for the inconvenience, and say I'd appreciate being considered again after 3-6 months.\n\nAny honest thoughts on how to make this decision?",

This was surprising to me because he's normally one of the most sought-after professors at the school, where his wait-lists were always 20+ people.\n\nHe said that this also happened to another CS professor there, where several classes in total were cut due to limited interest, and also said that his wait-lists and enrollments had decreased significantly.\n\nWhile this is anecdotal in nature, just thought I'd share!",

Folding clothes, scanning barcodes, dealing with customers who yell at me over coupons. Meanwhile, I’m watching my classmates post on LinkedIn about their shiny new jobs at big companies. Some even got roles before graduating.\n\nI’m applying like crazy. Dozens of resumes, tailored cover letters, trying to learn new stuff on the side (CompTIA, some Python). I’ve even offered to volunteer with local nonprofits just to build experience — nothing yet.\n\nI can’t help but feel like I missed something. Like I took the \"safe\" path, got the degree, but forgot to do all the extra stuff that actually makes you hirable.\n\nIf you’ve been here — working a non-tech job post-grad, trying to break in — what helped you make the jump?

If all hands presentations are any indicator, my company is really drinking the \"Pivot to AI as a business model\" Kool Aid. And so I feel like I can’t turn down AI projects or even discuss my concerns without it seeming like insubordination, or putting a target on my back as not aligned with the company’s vision, or seeming like a luddite uninterested in learning new skills.\n\nI realize “AI” is a lot more than just ChatGPT-generated slop, and so I want to at least be open-minded to the ways it can be a useful tool without the ethical concerns. But I’m unsure to what extent those applications \\*do\\* exist, and if they do, how to initiate a conversation about finding projects that would be less soul-crushing.

        "content": "Hi,\n\n When reading people arguing about unemployment in software, the same usual reasons are often invoked : economic uncertainty, high interest rates, offshoring, overhiring, AI, ...\n\nBut i rarely see anybody question supply and demand at a global scale.\n\nWhy is almost everybody so certain that we will always need more developers at the same rate as we produce graduates ?\n\nAren't we SWEs masters of automatisation, of reducing manual work ? Every framework or library we produce aims to reduce the amount of work we have to spend to achieve some result.\n\nThe western world represents  15-20% of the population, and we can imagine the remaining 80% catching up will keep on producing more and more engineers as years go by, especially as long as IT is considered the holy grail of sure employment and high pay.\n\nWith software being shipped at light speed, and a single software being usable by billions of users around the world, i'm wondering if we will not hit a ceiling ? A moment where, full stop, we'll have too many CS trained people, and every extra million trained CS graduate will mean an extra million CS trained person not working in a CS related field. It sounds like it could be brutal.\n\nAnd it seems like most majors already went through this stage.\n\nWhy not CS ?\n\n",

When I recieved my offer letter for a full time position, I had just failed my FE test and got low-balled (in my opinion). A job was better than no job at the time. I then recieved all the benefit paperwork and my jaw fell to the floor (not good). I have continuously applied to other jobs and will likely start hearing back soon.\n\nI love the substance of the work but do not feel valued at this company. Since being an intern, I feel \"stuck\" on the bottom of the superiority totem pole. Our industry has been getting worse and worse, and layoffs will start soon. I have been told I will NOT be the first to go, because I am the lowest paid engineer with the highest potential. I understand from the company's point of view but out of self respect, I would like to be valued more someplace else.\n\nIs it a respectful choice to make a year or two with the company, or just ride where the wind takes me?\n\n\\*Note: I am aware I got low-balled because my \"best office friend\" is another department head. My boss flips over the paper when it comes around to discussion of my salary. He knows it will come back to me and doesnt want anyone to know I accepted something so low. At the time I had no leverage. I turned away 3 other offers prior to signing this one, before realizing the benefits were worse. ",

        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "If you think AI will be replacing you as an engineer, you are probably wildly overestimating the AI, or underestimating yourself. Let me explain.\n\nThe best AI cannot even do 10% of my job as a senior software engineer I estimate. And there are hard problems which prevent them from doing any better, not in the least of which is that they already ran out of training data. They are also burning through billions with no profitability in sight, almost as quickly as they are burning through natural resources such as water, electricity and chips. Not even to mention the hardest problem which is that it is a machine (or rather, routine), not a sentient being with creativity. It will always think \"inside the box\" even if that box appears to be very large. While they are at it, they hallucinate quite a good percentage of their answers as well, making them critically flawed for even the more mundane tasks without tight supervision. None of these problems have a solution in the LLM paradigm. \n\nLLMs for coding is a square peg for a round hole. People tend to think that due to AI being a program that it naturally must be good at programming, but it really doesn't work that way. It is the engineers that make the program, not the other way around. They are far better at stuff like writing and marketing, but even there it is still a tool at best and not replacing any human directly. Yes, it can replace humans indirectly through efficiency gains but only up till a point. In the long term, the added productivity gained from using the tool should merit hiring more people, so this would lead to more jobs, not less.\n\nThe reason we are seeing so many layoffs right now is simply due to the post-pandemic slump. Companies hired like crazy, had all kinds of fiscal incentives and the demand was at an all time high. Now all these factors have been reversed and the market is correcting. Also, the psychopathic tendency to value investors over people has increased warranting even more cost cutting measures disguised as AI efficiency gains. That's why it is so loved by investors, it's a carte blanche to fire people and \"trim the fat\" as they put it. For the same reason, Microsoft's CEO is spouting nonsense that XX% of the code is already written by AI. It's not true, but it raises the stock price like clockwork, and that’s the primary mission of a CEO of a large public company.\n\ntl;dr AI is mostly a grift artificially kept afloat by investor billions which are quickly running out",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm currently at a point, where I do not know what to do and would appreciate some perspectives.\n\nMy background:\nI have a Master's degree in Business Administration & Economics (studied at a german uni, am german myself). During my masters I started to go down the self-taught dev route. Now I have been working for 2 years as IT consultant and software developer in an enterprise environment (Java Spring Boot). Currently self-studying CS fundamentals through teachyourselfcs.com (working through CS:APP right now). I'm aware I have some gaps in my CS knowledge, which is why I started the self-study route. Now I'm considering going back to university for a CS Bachelor's degree (would do it part-time while keeping my full-time job. Studying evenings/weekends. Would be at a \"Hochschule\" that costs 19k€).\n\nThe thing is, I could spend those 3.5 years on getting the CS Bachelor's degree OR continuing self-study, building projects, gaining more work experience and getting certifications.\n\nFrom a career perspective, my main question is: What looks better in the (European) job market:\n\n1. Having that CS degree on paper after already working in the field\n2. Having no CS degree, but a few certificates and a couple personal projects and focusing more on my career in the current company.\n\nI'm genuinely torn. Part of me wants the \"proper\" CS foundation and having something to show for it, but another part thinks that time could be better invested in practical experience and targeted learning. Also I would basically just do it for the \"academic proof\" for future employers, as I think that some of the stuff learned during the CS-degree is not practical and the important topics are also learnable by self-study, as I am currently doing.\n\nAnyone been in a similar situation? How did it work out? Would love to hear thoughts from both hiring managers and developers who've taken either path.\n\nThanks!",

I am a full-stack developer who is planning on changing jobs soon, and I've noticed that experience with React + Node seems to be in high demand, but I have close to zero experience with that setup. Most of my career I have worked with frameworks surrounding php and java, such as Laravel, Spring, Struts, etc.\n\nI have plenty of time at the moment and I was thinking that I might as well take some course or pursue some certification that would look good on LinkedIn. Can you recommend something, either for just React for now, or for React + Node? I was thinking of anything I can complete within a few weeks, ideally not much more than that.\n\nSo far I've been considering Meta's [React Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/meta-react-specialization) on Coursera, or maybe IBM's [JavaScript Programming with React, Node & MongoDB Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/javascript-programming-with-react-node-mongodb?specialization=meta-front-end-developer), also on Coursera. Someone else on a different subreddit recommended the [Full Stack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course from the University of Helsinki, which looks comprehensive and touches many modern technologies I am not familiar with, but which could be overkill for someone who is already a developer, I guess.\n\nPlease, I know it might be a boring question, but can you please offer some guidance? Again, what I want is:\n\n* Learning about React and Node (or, first one thing and then the other one) \n* A reputable certificate to add to my resume and Linkedin profile \n* Ideally, an endeavor that requires not more than a few weeks (a couple of months would be my absolute max)",

My stack is Django, React, Laravel and basically you get the idea - I'm a web dev.\n\nHowever, I don't really see myself doing this for 3 other years. I'd like to transition to a role that's more similar to hands-on, dealing with real world systems like I don't know, vehicles for example. Things you can see and touch and see working, you know? Web dev is good and pays the bills, I'm comfortable enough that I can afford a trip every now and then while taking out the gf, but I'd much rather work with something I can see and touch.\n\nThe obvious suggestion is blue-collar work, but I'd like to use my programming experience somehow, and was wondering what gateways / courses I could start getting into to facilitate that transition. My experience as web dev is solid, but things like micro-controllers and such I have any (although I have worked with C++).\n\nAnyone can suggest a potential gateway for that? I have a degree in Systems Engineering and I don't mind learning and working, I've done it all these years, but I really want to transition into a role that requires me to be more present and still pays well/decently.

What languages do I need to know, and what resources would you recommend to effectively learn them? As for projects, after my class is done, i will create a LA calculator and a mass-spring model( differential equations). This will integrate my math knowledge with coding, and will be good for me to put on GitHub. Beyond that, i know there’s Leetcode, which is good because i learn best by doing practice problems. My stretch goal is to get a summer 2026 internship in CS, no matter how small. I know that since i’m late to the party, i will have to start small. this is fine by me, i just need my foot in the door.

Don't really like the job and my team isn't technical at all.\n\n# Option 2: Move to Canada for Waterloo’s in-person MEng (includes a co-op term)\n\n* **Cost:** Tuition plus rent and living costs in Waterloo, so I would burn savings (but I can afford it)\n* **Upside:** Waterloo’s name carries weight, and the co-op cycle should drop me into genuine dev roles and help me build a network in Canadian tech\n* **Downside:** Two years of full-time study at age 24, plus the chance I still end up fighting for the same entry-level SWE spots afterward.

My brief understanding is that here things get blurry because it's more about finding a specific research supervisor and field of research, rather than just trying to get into the highest ranking school you can. \n\nOf course we need a criterion, so I'd say something like 'future career prospect maximization'. \n\nMy concern is that as a mature student with a likely weaker applicant profile, I would probably get into a lower ranking school than my undergrad school.

        "content": "At work, one of my (26) tasks is monthly patches. I move them to 2 networks after my coworker moves them to her network first typically. She'll get a drive from the security office and then I use that drive after she's done. In June, it took her a week because the file sizes of the patches were bigger and whatever internet connection she was using was quite slow. I took the drive from her the week after. I was a whole week late to finish up my part of the patches on the 2 networks I do it on. Not to mention, a few updates from these patches can be moved very easily without the drive and I usually move those first anyway and for some reason, I waited till I got the drive to do those too! I assumed the security office only had 1 drive but I JUST went and asked them and they have 3 apparently! I should have done this before.\n\nMy boss wasn't very happy and there is a meeting with a few members on the team in 1-2 weeks to discuss patching. I feel like this will reflect really poorly on me. My boss also asked that I create an email chain so we all keep track of patching progress in July, so I've been working extra fast to get them all done this month! I hope they don't ask me what I was doing during that one week delay in June because that was 2 weeks ago and I have no idea why I wasn't more proactive. How badly do you think this can affect me? ",

        "content": "Hey all,\n\nPosting here even though my field is mechanical, felt like a good spot to get advice but do work in tech/auto.\n\nWrapping up a graduate contract at my first job out of school and got a few offers already/seems promising for things lined up.\n\nGot a job offer recently from a big EV maker in east bay, lived there before to do some internships and pay is good - around 140k TC but also speaking with a neurotech startup I used to work for remotely in NYC about starting soon, they mentioned pay is around 100k. Third job is looking promising in LA county - where my current contract is for about 90k at a consumer goods maker, had my last round today.\n\nWhile its great to have so many offers, having trouble  deciding, the bay job has best name and job itself for my field - by far, so it seems like a no brainer, however as someone who love to travel and try new things, location is huge and having already lived in the bay and LA county, always wanted to try living in the city as I never have before (all jobs and former life in suburbs) and to be honest east bay was not an enjoyable life for me when I did - found it very slow and difficult to meet people outside of work. Currently love LA county too and makes choosing the job here enticing as I just built a friend group and life over the last year here - all three have their perks.\n\nGuess my question to those who have taken either decision to try something new just based on location, was it worth it, what advice do you have for someone young (24). A lot of people I talk to tell me different things, some say choose the best career (mostly family), some friends say go take the risk and move to the city, also feels a little guilty to choose \"fun\" over securing what is easily best for my career.",
