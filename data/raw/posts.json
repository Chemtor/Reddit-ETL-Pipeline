I can prompt an LLM, get something 80% of the way there, and then refine it to fit the exact need. It’s massively boosted my productivity.\n\nThat said, I sometimes worry I’m not building the same depth of understanding I would if I were digging through docs or troubleshooting syntax from scratch. But with the pace and volume of work I’m expected to handle, using LLMs feels necessary.\n\nAs I think about the next step in my career, I’m curious: how do senior data engineers view this approach? Is leveraging LLMs seen as smart and efficient, or does it raise concerns about foundational knowledge and long-term growth?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, especially from those who mentor or manage junior engineers.",

Otherwise, companies are just benching you or don’t care. I used to chase on 4th day for a response, if I don’t hear back, I never chased.\n5) Speed : Apply to jobs posted within a week and move faster in the process. Candidates who move fast have high chances to get job. Remember, if someone takes inter view before you and are a good fit, they will get the job doesn’t matter how good you are . \n6) Just learn new tools and did some projects, and you are good to go with that technology.\n\nBest of Luck to Everyone!!!! \n",

We need to build a data warehouse to track sales performance, inventory levels, and product information. Data comes from multiple sources and has different update frequencies.\nData Description\nYou are provided with the following data points:\n * Product Information (updated daily):\n   * product_id (unique identifier)\n   * product_name\n   * category (e.g., Electronics, Apparel)\n   * supplier_id\n   * supplier_name\n   * unit_price (the price can change over time)\n * Sales Transactions (streamed in real-time):\n   * order_id\n   * product_id\n   * customer_id\n   * order_timestamp\n   * quantity_sold\n   * sale_price_per_unit\n   * shipping_address (city, state, zip code)\n * Inventory Levels (snapshot taken every hour):\n   * product_id\n   * warehouse_id\n   * stock_quantity\n   * snapshot_timestamp\nRequirements\nDesign a dimensional data warehouse model that addresses the following:\n * Data Model Design:\n   * Create a star or snowflake schema with fact and dimension tables to store this data efficiently.\n   * Your model must handle changes in product prices over time (Slowly Changing Dimensions).\n   * The design must accommodate both real-time sales data and hourly inventory snapshots.\n * Schema Definition:\n   * Define the tables with appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, data types, and constraints.\n * Data Processing Considerations:\n   * Explain how your model supports analyzing historical sales with the product prices that were active at the time of sale.\n   * Describe how to handle the different granularities of the sales (transactional) and inventory (hourly snapshot) data.\nDeliverables\n * A complete Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrating your proposed data model.\n * SQL DDL statements for creating all tables, keys, and indexes.\n * A written explanation detailing:\n   * The reasoning behind your modeling choices (e.g., why you chose a specific SCD type).\n   * The trade-offs you considered.\n   * How your model enables key business queries, such as \"What was the total revenue by product category last month?\" and \"What is the current inventory level for our top 10 selling products?\"\n   * Your recommended indexing strategy to optimize query performance.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSection 3: Architectural Design Challenge\nBusiness Context\nAn e-commerce company wants to implement a new product recommendation engine on its website. To power this engine, the data team needs to capture user behavior events, process them, and make the resulting insights available for both real-time recommendations and analytical review.\nRequirements:\n1. Design a complete data architecture to:\n * Collect Event Data:\nTrack key user interactions: product_view, add_to_cart, purchase, and product_search.\n\nEnsure data collection is reliable and can handle high traffic during peak shopping seasons.\n\nThe collection mechanism should be lightweight to avoid impacting website performance.\n\n* Process and Enrich Data:\nEnrich raw events with user information (e.g., user ID, session ID) and product details (e.g., category, price) from other company databases.\n\nTransform the event streams into a structured format suitable for analysis and for the recommendation model.\nSupport both a real-time path (to update recommendations during a user's session) and a batch path (to retrain the main recommendation model daily).\n\n* Make Data Accessible:\nProvide the real-time processed data to the recommendation engine API.\n\nLoad the batch-processed data into a data warehouse for the analytics team to build dashboards and analyze user behavior patterns.\n\nEnsure the solution is scalable, cost-effective, and has proper monitoring.\n\n2. Deliverables\n* Architecture Diagram: A detailed diagram showing all components (e.g., event collectors, message queues, stream/batch processors, databases) and data flows.\n\n* Technical Specifications:\nA list of the specific technologies/services you would use for each component and a justification for your choices.\nA high-level schema for the raw event data and the structured data in the warehouse.\nYour strategy for monitoring the pipeline and ensuring data quality.\n\n* Implementation Considerations:\nA brief discussion of how the architecture supports both real-time and batch requirements.\nRecommendations for ensuring the system is scalable and cost-effective.\n\n\n",

Then I connected that to Power BI and built some dashboards so far, so good. So now my company basically wants to treat Power BI like it’s Excel. They’re asking me to do all these super manual things—like create 70 or 80 different pages, tweak filters, export them all as PDFs, and basically use it as some kind of extraction tool. I’ve always seen Power BI as a reporting tool, not a substitute for Excel or a design tool.\n\nAnd on top of that, they expect me to wear every hat database designer, machine learning engineer, Power BI dashboard creator, you name it. It’s a startup, so I get that we all wear multiple hats, but I’m feeling pretty stretched thin and just wondering if anyone else has dealt with this. Is this normal?

        "author": "Smooth-Leadership-35",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "I'm hoping some experienced folks can give some insight. I am a data engineer and architect who worked his way up from analytics engineer. I've built end-to-end pipelines that served data scientists, visualizations, applications, or other groups data platforms numerous times. I can do everything from the DataOps / MLOps to the actual analytics if needed (I have an academic ML background). I can also troubleshoot pipelines that see large volumes of users on the application end and my last technical role was as an architect/ reliability engineer consulting across many different sized companies.\n\nI've finally secured a more leadership-type position as the principal data strategist (I have no interest in being middle management leading technical groups). The issue is the company is in the construction sector and largely only uses Microsoft365. There is some Azure usage that is currently locked down by IT and they won't even give me read-only access. There is no one at the company who understands cloud concepts or software engineering -- the Azure env is set up from consoles, there is no versioning (like no Git let alone Yaml), and the CIO doesn't even understand containers. The engineers vibe code and if they need an application demo for a client, they'll vibe the python and use Streamlit and put it on a free public server.\n\nI'm honestly beside myself and don't know what to do about the environment in general. IT is largely incompetent when it comes to any sort of modern practices and there's a lot of nepotism so no one gets fired and if you aren't related to someone, you're shit out of luck.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what to do here.  \nPros:  \n\\- I have the elevated title so I feel like that raises me to a different \"social level\" as I find higher leaders are now wanting to engage with me on LinkedIn  \n\\- Right now I kind of have a very flexible schedule and can decide how I want to structure my day. That is very different from other roles I've been in that had mandatory standups and JIRAs and all that jazz  \n\\- This gives me time to think about pet projects.\n\n\\- Adding a pro I forgot to add -- there is room for me to kind of learn this type of position (more leadership, less tech) and make mistakes. There's no one else gunning for this position (they kind of made it for me) so I have no fear of testing something out and then having it fail -- whether that's an idea, a communication style, a long term strategy map, etc. They don't know what to expect from me honestly so I have the freedom to kind of make something up. The fear is that nothing ends up being accepted as actionable due to the culture of not wanting to change processes.\n\nCons:  \n\\- I'm paid 'ok' but nothing special. I gave up a $40k higher salary when I took this position.  \n\\- There is absolutely no one who can talk about modern software. It's all vibe coders who try to use LLMs for everything. There is absolutely no structure to the company either -- everyone is silo'ed and everyone does what they want so there's just random Python notebooks all over Sharepoint, random csv files where ever, etc  \n\\- The company is very old school so everything is Microsoft365. I can't even get a true Azure playground. if I want to develop on the cloud, I'll need to buy my own subscription. I'm forced to use a PC.  \n\\- I feel like it's going to be hard to stay current, but I do have colleagues to talk to from previous jobs who are current and intelligent.  \n\\- My day to day is extremely frustrating because no one understands software in the slightest. I'm still trying to figure out what I can even suggest to improve their data issues.  \nThere are no allies since IT is so locked down (I can't even get answers to questions from them) and their leader doesn't understand cloud or software engineering. Also no one at the company wants to change their ways in the slightest.\n\nRight now my plan is: (this is what I'm asking for feedback on)  \n\\- Try to make it here at least 2 years and use the elevated title to network -- I suck at networking though so can you give some pointers?  \n\\- use this time to grow my brand. Post to Medium, post to LinkedIn about current topics and any pet projects I can come up with.  \n\\- Take some MBA level courses as I will admit that I have no business background and if I want to try to align to business goals, I have to understand how businesses (larger businesses) work.  \n\\- Try to stay current -- this is the hard one -- I'm not sure if I should just start paying out the nose for my own cloud playground? My biggest shortcoming is never building a high volume streaming pipeline end-to-end. I understand all the tech and I've designed such pipelines for clients, but have never had to build and work in one day to day which would reveal many more things to take into consideration. To do this on my own may be $$$. I will be looking for side consulting jobs to try to stay in the game as well.  \n\\- I'm hoping that if I can stay just current enough and add in business strategy skills, I'd be a unique candidate for some high level roles? All my career people have always told me that I'm different because I'm a really intelligent person who actually has social skills (I have a lot of interesting hobbies that I can connect with others over).\n\nOr I could bounce, make $45k+ more and go back into a higher pressure, faster moving env as a Lead Data Architect/ engineer. I kind of don't want to do that bc I do need a temporary break from the startup world.  \nIf I wait and try to move toward director of data platform, I could make at least $75k more, but I guess I'm not sure what to do between now and then to make sure I could score that sort of title considering it's going to be REALLY hard to prove my strategy can create movement at this current company. I'm mostly scared of staying here and getting really far behind and never being able to get another position.",

        "title": "# Roast my project: DataCompose: I brought shadcn's copy-to-own pattern to pyspark - am I stupid?",
        "author": "nonamenomonet",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone, sorry for the provocative title. I'd love to get some feedback on a project I've been working on. I was inspired by how full-stack developers use shadcn and shadcn-svelte (svelte is superior to react btw) with their \"copy-to-own\" pattern. \n\nI think this pattern could solve a common pain point in data engineering: most of us work in environments where adding new dependencies requires extensive justification. What if we could get the functionality we need without adding dependencies, while still owning and understanding every line of code?\n\nHere's how it works: [DataCompose](https://github.com/datacompose/datacompose) maintains a registry of battle tested (read: aggressively unit tested) data cleaning primitives. The CLI copies these directly into your repo as plain PySpark code. No runtime dependencies, no magic. You can modify, extend, or completely rewrite them. Once the code is in your repo, you can even delete the CLI and everything still works.\n\n**Note**: The generated code assumes you already have PySpark set up in your environment. DataCompose focuses on providing the cleaning logic, not managing your Spark installation. \n\n\n\n## Code Example \n\n```bash\ndatacompose init\n\n# Generate email cleaning primitives\ndatacompose add clean_emails --target pyspark\n\n# Generate address standardization primitives  \ndatacompose add clean_addresses --target pyspark\n\n# Generate phone number validation primitives\ndatacompose add clean_phone_numbers --target pyspark\n```\n\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\n# Import the generated primitives\nfrom build.pyspark.clean_emails.email_primitives import emails\n\n# Create Spark session\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"DataCleaning\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Load your data\ndf = spark.read.csv(\"data.csv\", header=True)\n\n# Apply email transformations\ncleaned_df = df.withColumn(\n    \"email_clean\",\n    emails.standardize_email(F.col(\"email\"))\n).withColumn(\n    \"email_domain\",\n    emails.extract_domain(F.col(\"email_clean\"))\n).withColumn(\n    \"is_valid\",\n    emails.is_valid_email(F.col(\"email_clean\"))\n)\n\n# Filter to valid emails only\nvalid_emails = cleaned_df.filter(F.col(\"is_valid\"))\n```\n`\n\nI wanted to bring some of Svelte's magic to this, so my personal favorite way to do data transformations is like this:\n\n```python\nfrom build.clean_emails.email_primitives import emails\n\n# Create a comprehensive email cleaning pipeline\n@emails.compose()\ndef clean_email_pipeline(email_col):\n    # Fix common typos first (gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc)\n    email = emails.fix_common_typos(email_col)\n    \n    # Standardize the email (lowercase, trim whitespace)\n    email = emails.standardize_email(email)\n    \n    # For Gmail addresses, normalize dots and plus addressing\n    if emails.is_gmail(email):\n        email = emails.normalize_gmail(email)\n    \n    # Validate and mark suspicious patterns\n    is_valid = emails.is_valid_email(email)\n    is_disposable = emails.is_disposable_domain(email)\n\n# Apply the pipeline to your dataframe\ndf = df.withColumn(\"email_results\", clean_email_pipeline(F.col(\"raw_email\")))\n```\n\nOr you can do it like this (like a normie):\n```python\ndef clean_email_pipeline(col):\n    # Fix common typos first (gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc)\n    col = emails.fix_common_typos(col)    \n    col = emails.standardize_email(col)\n    \n    # For Gmail addresses, normalize dots and plus addressing\n    if emails.is_gmail(col):\n        col = emails.normalize_gmail(col)\n    \n    return col\n\ndf = df.withColumn(\"email_results\", clean_email_pipeline(F.col(\"raw_email\")))\n\n```\n\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Composable Primitives**: Build complex transformations from simple, reusable functions\n- **Smart Partial Application**: Configure transformations with parameters for reuse\n- **Pipeline Compilation**: Convert declarative pipeline definitions into optimized Spark operations\n- **Code Generation**: Generate standalone PySpark code with embedded dependencies\n- **Comprehensive Libraries**: Pre-built primitives for emails, addresses, and phone numbers\n- **Conditional Logic**: Support for if/else branching in pipelines\n- **Type Safe Operations**: All transformations maintain Spark column type safety\n\n## Why This Approach?\n\n- **You Own Your Code**: No external dependencies to manage or worry about breaking changes\n- **Full Transparency**: Every transformation is readable, debuggable PySpark code you can understand\n- **Customization First**: Need to adjust a transformation? Just edit the code\n\n## I AM LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK !!!! I WANT TO KNOW IF I AM CRAZY OR NOT!\n\nCurrently supporting three primitive types: addresses, emails, and phone numbers. More coming based on YOUR feedback.\n\n**Playground Demo**: [github.com/datacompose/datacompose-demo](https://github.com/datacompose/datacompose-demo)  \n**Main Repo**: [github.com/datacompose/datacompose](https://github.com/datacompose/datacompose)\n\n\n\n\n",

        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hey everyone, author here. We just published a piece exploring the idea of an ORM for analytical databases, and I wanted to share it with this community specifically.\n\nThe core idea is that while ORMs are great for OLTP, extending a tool like Prisma or Drizzle to OLAP databases like ClickHouse is a bad idea because the semantics of core concepts are completely different.\n\nWe use two examples to illustrate this. In OLTP, columns are nullable by default; in OLAP, they aren't. unique() in OLTP means write-time enforcement, while in ClickHouse it means eventual deduplication via a ReplacingMergeTree engine. Hiding these differences is dangerous.\n\nWhat are the principles for an OLAP-native DX? We propose that a better tool should:\n\n* Borrow the best parts of ORMs (schemas-as-code, migrations).\n\n* Promote OLAP-native semantics and defaults.\n\n* Avoid hiding the power of the underlying SQL and its rich function library.\n\nWe've built an open-source, MIT licensed project called Moose OLAP to explore these ideas.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or hear your thoughts/opinions on this topic!",

SCD2 would mean custom dbt jobs, adding cost and complexity.\n\nAirbyte is quite flexible and there’s an open source advantage but maintaining connectors and building masking/SCD2 feels is too much DIY work.\n\nLooking for advice:\n\n- Is Fivetran or Airbyte the best pick for this? Any other alternative setups that we can pilot?\n- Have you dealt with PII masking before landing data in a warehouse? How did you handle it?\n- Any experience building or managing SCD Type 2?\n- If you have pulled data from Salesforce or HubSpot, were there any surprises around rate limits or schema changes?\n\nOk this post went long.

We're all convinced we're right (obviously), so I thought I'd throw it to the Reddit hive mind.\n\nHere's the scenario: We need to get our data into this third-party tool. They've given us four options:\n\n1. **API key integration** – We build the connection on our end, push data to them via their API\n2. **Direct database connector** – We give them credentials to connect directly to our DB and they pull what they need\n3. **Secure file upload** – We dump files into something like S3, they pick them up from there\n4. **Something else entirely** – Open to other suggestions\n\nI'm leaning towards option 1 because we keep control, but my teammate reckons option 2 is simpler. Our security lead is having kittens about giving anyone direct DB access though.\n\nWhich would you go for and why? Bonus points if you can explain it like I'm presenting to the board next week!\n\n**Edit:** This is for a mid-size company, nothing too sensitive but standard business data protection applies.\n\n",

How do you personally deal with sites that keep changing layouts so you don’t end up rewriting extractors every other week?

There are 15 databases involved, one for each environment/layer for example: COMMON_DEV, BRONZE_DEV, SILVER_DEV, GOLD_DEV, and WORK_DEV...for each environment.\n\nWe discussed what objects we needed permissions on and they built us a stored procedure that creates a new schema, roles and grants the appropriate permissions.  We have a schema per client approach and access roles at the schema level.\n\nThey left with little to no documentation on the process.  As I started migrating clients into the new schemas I found issues, I created views in GOLD that reference SILVER and the views are failing because they do not have access.\n\nI talked with Snowflake and they are helping with this but said is by design and medallion layers do not have this type of access.  They are being very helpful with meeting our \"new requirements\".... \n\nThis is where I need some assistance.  Please correct me if I am wrong, but isnt it medallion layers architecture 101 that views work across layers...  I didn't think this would have to be explicitly stated upfront in a statement of work. \n\nHow have you seen solutions architected to ensure separation of layer but allow for views to read across layers?

I'd say from a technical standpoint I'm pretty damn good at SQL and have a strong understanding of the Tableau ecosystem and while I've used dbt a little, it's not my specialty, nor is working directly in a warehouse or using Python (I've accessed literally one API with it lol). It also seems like a really good company with a 10-20% raise from my current salary. I would say that I've had exposure along the whole pipeline and have a general understanding of modern data engineering but I would honestly be learning 80% of it on the job. Has anyone gone through something similar? I'd love to get the opportunity to take it but I wouldn't want to be facing super high expectations as soon as I arrive and not be able to get up and running a month or two in.",

        "content": "Hey community, I'm building an AI workflow for an internal tool and would appreciate some advice, as this is my first time working with something like that. My background is DevOps not AI so please excuse any ignorant question.\n\nOur company has a programming tool for controlling sorting robots, where workflows are defined in a YAML file. Each step in the workflow is a block that can execute a CLI tool.. I am using an LLM (Gemini 2.5 pro) to automatically generate these yaml files from a simplified user prompt (build a workflow to sort red and green cubes). Currently we have around 1000 internal helper CLIs for these tasks so no LLM knows about them.\n\nMy current approach:\n\nSince the LLM has no knowledge of our interna CLI tools, I've come up with this two-stage process which is reecommend everywhere:\n\n1. **Stage 1** The users prompt is sent to an LLM. Its task is to formulate questions for a vector database (which contains all our CLI tool man pages) to figure out which specific tools are needed to fulfill the users request, and which flags to use.\n2. **Stage 2** The man page (or sections) retrieved in the first stage is then passed to a second LLM call, along with the original user prompt and instructions on how to structure the YAML. This stage generates the final output.\n\nSo here is my problem or lack of understanding:\n\nFor the first stage, how can I help the LLM to generate the right search queries for a vector database and select the right CLI tools from over these 1000? Should it also generate questions at this first stage to find the right flags for each CLI tool?\n\nIs providing the LLM with a simple list of all CLI tool names and a one-line description for each the best way to start? I'm not sure how it would know to ask the right questions about specific flags, arguments, and their usage without more basic context. But I also can't provide it with 1000 basic descriptions? Gemini has a large attention window but I mean its still a lot.\n\nFor the second stage, I'm not sure what is the best way to provide the retrieved docs to the generator LLM. I've two options I believe?\n\n* **Option A: entire manpage**  For each CLI tool chosen by he first LLM I pass in the entire man page. A workflow could have 10 manpages or even more, so I would pass 10 entire man pages to the second stage, that feels overkill. This for sure contains all info to the LLM but its enourmous and the token count is through the roof, and the LLM might even loose attention?\n* **Option B: chunks** I could generate smaller more targeted chunks of the man pages and add them to the Vector database. This would help with my token problem but I also feel this might miss important context since the LLM has 0 knowledge about these tools.\n\nSo I am not sure if I identified the right problems, or if the problem I have is actually a different one. Can anyone help me understand this more? Thanks a lot!",

There’s no sprints or agile stuff, I work on projects here and there, shifting my focus kinda haphazardly to whatever needs done. There’s just a couple problems.\n\n1. I make $19/hr. This is astronomically low, though what I’m doing isn’t all that hard.\n2. I don’t think my work is the same as the rest of the industry. I work with mostly whatever tools I want, but we don’t do any cloud stuff, I don’t really collaborate with anyone, there’s no code reviews or PRs or anything like that. My work mainly consists of “find x data source, setup a way to ingest it, do some transformations, and maybe load it into our DB if we want it.” I mostly do stuff with polars, duckdb, and sometimes pandas. I also do some random things on the side like web scraping/browser automation. We work with A LOT of data, so we have 2 beefy servers, but even then not working with the cloud is really odd to me (though we are a niche government contracted company).\n3. The restrictions are kinda insane. First of all, because we’re government contractors, we went from 2/5 work from home days to 5/5 in office days (thanks Trump). So that sucks, but also the software I can use is heavily restricted. We use company PCs, so I can’t download anything onto them, not even browser extensions. Many sites are blocked, and things move slowly. On the development side, only Python packages are allowed on an individual basis. Anything else needs to go through the admin team and takes awhile to get approved. I’ve found ways around this, but it’s not something I should be doing.\n\nSo, after working here for almost a year, is it time to look for other jobs? I don’t have a degree, but I’ve been programming since I was a kid with a lot of projects under my belt, and now this “professional” experience. Mostly I just want more money, and the commute is long, and working from home a bit would be nice. But honestly I just wanna make $60k a year for 5 years and I’ll be good. I don’t know what raises are like here, but I imagine not very good. What should I do?",

        "content": "Hey!\n\nMy company has defined some custom types in their backend services PostgreSQL databases to store numeric and monetary amounts. Basically they store values like USD 123.45 as a string-typed triplet (12345,2,USD) so (value,scale,currency).\n\nIt's practical for backend engineers given their codebase and it makes their computations faster (int operations) and safer (regarding float precision in Python). But on the data engineering side, when loading the data, we have to parse all these columns (there are a lot). We also have some internal tool directly reading their databases so we also have to do parsing on the go inside already complex queries.\n\nI have read some articles about custom types in PostgreSQL who say to avoid it as much as possible because of that. I wasn't in the company when they decided to go this way with numeric type but apparently the main argument was PostgreSQL decimal types are not precise enough, though I've used Decimal(38,18) in the past and it was very fine.\n\nWhat's your opinion on it ? Should I try to push for a change there or cope with it ?",

        "author": "ihatebeinganonymous",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "Hi. We all have probably heard about this [cost centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_centre_(business)) vs. [profit centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_center) and how this is \"safer\" as a software engineer to work in a profit centre, as you produce revenue and not cost.\n\nI have been thinking about that for years. I have one main ambiguity regarding that distinction: Every cost centre can be someone else's profit centre no? \n\nIf we stick strictly to this definition, then the only safe place to work is more or less in the consulting business, where you charge for your hours. Maybe also businesses that sell the actual software. For example, in Google, is every unit a cost centre except the Ads department (and a few others)?\n\nThen also:\n\n1. If I'm a data engineer (hence this sub) writing the data pipeline to support the sales/support division, am I in a cost centre? \n\n2. If I write internal software for other units within our org, including the traditional \"profit centres\", do I have no role in the profit making? \n\n3. If I maintain the monitoring pipeline, ensuring availability of our (chargeable) service, is it pure cost?\n\n4. What if I maintain the web portal of a car sale business? Or the AI-based voice assistant of a healthcare provider?\n\n5. Is every IT work in a bank a cost centre?\n\nThere are many more example. Maybe including R&D work, data science, etc..\n\nWhat do you think? Does this distinction still hold, now that IT is not a luxury or \"nice to have\" feature?\n\n\nMany thanks",

For backstory, I’ve got a synapse analytics subscription, along with an Azure sql server.\n\nI’ve imported a bunch of csv data into the data lake, and now I want to transform it and store it in the data warehouse.\n\nSomething isn’t quite clicking for me yet though. I’m not sure where I’m meant to store all the intermediate steps between raw data -> processed data (there is a lot of filtering and cleaning and joining I need to do). Like how do I pass data around in memory without persisting it?\n\nNormally I would have a bunch of different views and tables to work with, but in Synapse I’m completely dumbfounded.\n\n1) Am I supposed to read from the csv’s do some work then write it back to a csv in the lake?\n\n2) should I be reading from the csvs, doing a bit of merging, writing to the Azure SQL db? \n\n3) Should I be using a dedicated SQL pool instead?\n\nInterested to hear everyone’s thoughts about how you use Azure Synapse for DW!\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "We're seeing a flood of compact language models hitting the market weekly - Gemma3 270M, LFM2 1.2B, SmolLM3 3B, and many others. The pattern is always the same: organizations release these models with a disclaimer essentially saying \"this performs poorly out-of-the-box, but fine-tune it for your specific use case and watch it shine.\"\n\nI believe we're witnessing the beginning of a major shift in AI adoption. Instead of relying on massive general-purpose models, companies will increasingly fine-tune these lightweight models into specialized agents for their particular needs. The economics are compelling - these small models are significantly cheaper to train, deploy, and operate compared to their larger counterparts, making AI accessible to businesses with tighter budgets.\n\nThis creates a huge opportunity for data engineers, who will become crucial in curating the right training datasets for each domain. The lower operational costs mean more companies can afford to experiment with custom AI solutions.\n\nThis got me thinking: what does high-quality training data actually look like for different industries when building these task-specific AI agents? Let's break down what effective agentic training data might contain across various sectors.\n\n**Discussion starter:** What industries do you think will benefit most from this approach, and what unique data challenges might each sector face?",

        "author": "CrimsonPilgrim",
        "subreddit": "dataengineering",
        "content": "My AWS-based side project has suddenly hit a wall while trying to get resources in a private VPC to reach AWS services.\n\nI'm a junior data engineer with less than a year of experience, and I've been working on a solo project to strengthen my skills, learn, and build my portfolio. Initially, it was mostly a data science project (NLP, model training, NER), but those are now long-forgotten memories. Instead, I've been diving deep into infrastructure, networking, and Terraform, discovering new worlds of pain every day while trying to optimize for every penny.\n\nAfter nearly a year of working on it at night, I'm proud of what I've learned, even though a public release is still a (very) distant goal. I was making steady progress... until four days ago.\n\nSo far, I have a Lambda function that writes S3 data into my Postgres database. Both are in the same private VPC. My database password was fully exposed in my Lambda function (I know, I know... there's just so much to learn as a single developer, and it was just for testing).\n\nRecently, I tried to make my infrastructure cleaner by storing the database password in SSM Parameter Store. To do this, my Lambda function now needs to access the SSM (and KMS) APIs. The recommended way to do this is by using VPC private endpoints. The problem is that they are billed per endpoint, per AZ, per hour, which I've desperately tried to avoid. This adds a significant cost ($14/month for two endpoints) for such a small necessity in my whole project.\n\nI'm really trying to find a solution. The only other path I've found is to use a lambda-to-lambda pattern (a public lambda calls the private lambda), but I'm afraid it won't scale and will cause problems later if I use this pattern every time I have this issue. I've considered simply not using SSM/KMS, but I'll probably face a similar same issue sooner or later with other services.\n\nIs there a solution that won't be billed hourly, as it dramatically increases my costs?",

        "content": "I recently compared Duck Lake with Starrocks. I was surprised to see  that Starrocks performed much better than Duklake+duckdb\nSome background on DuckDb - I have previously implemented DuckDb in a lambda to service  download requests asynchronously-  based on filter criteria selected from the UI, a query is constructed in the lambda and queries pre-aggregated parquet files to create CSVs. This works well with fairly compelx queries involving self joins, group by, having etc, for data size upto 5-8GB. However, given DuckDb's limitations around concurrency (multiple process can't read and write to the .DuckDb file at the same time), couldn't really use it in solutions designed with persistent mode. With DuckLake, this is no longer the case, as the data can reside in the object store, and ETL processes can safely update the data in DuckLake while being available to service queries. \nI get that comparison with a distributed processing engine isn't exactly a fair one- but the dataset size (SSB data) was ~30GB uncompressed- ~8GB in parquet. So this is right up DuckDb's alley. Also worth noting is that memory allocation to Starrocks BE nodes was ~7 GB per node, whereas DuckDb had around 23GB memory available. I was shocked to see DuckDb's in memory processing come short, having seen it easily outperform traditional DBMS like Postgres as well as modern engines like Druid in other projects.\nPlease see the detailed comparison here-\nhttps://medium.com/@anigma.55/rethinking-the-lakehouse-6f92dba519dc\n\nLet me know your thoughts.",

In this case, an approved developer would have to flatten out the source data and map the keys/column to the secret. For example, if colA is sensitive then we create a secret “colA” with value “fooA”.

I’ve also included real-world lessons from Windows AI Foundry and ETDI’s approach to tool verification. For those experimenting with LLM agents and MCP servers: how are you thinking about *prompt injection defense* and *tool registry safety*?

It's worth it, even if you want a job.\n\nProgramming is not coding and it has never been the same and it will never be the same. ChatGPT being able to create a game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript is not the same as what a Google senior software engineer is doing on a daily basis. Oftentimes you will hear that in professional settings you will spend more time writing out designs and reading code and in meetings that writing actual code and that is true. Meaning building out your problem solving and communication skills is way more important that anything AI could spit out. If you are truly investing all your time into AI thinking that you will get further than anyone else because you finished a To-Do app in 10 minutes, please think again. Anyone can learn to code. Coding is not what is in demand, it's programming.\n\nCoding is the tippity top of the iceberg, you will not get as far as you think you will without also training your brain. Your brain is the most important tool, not your keyboard. So, use AI wisely and do not fear the future, developers are needed because coding and programming are not the same thing. Learn it, it's fun, you can be very successful if you put in the work, and it can really change the way that you approach every day problems. AI will only replace you if you maintain that mindset of replacement and not of assistance.",

        "author": "NumberNinjas_Game",
        "subreddit": "learnprogramming",
        "content": "Hey all, I'm David and I'm a professional software developer who still loves coding, 20 years after graduating from college with my degree. I've earned my Bachelor's in Computer Systems Engineering, my Masters in Computer Science, and I've worked across all industries: embedded ,web, automation and even making a few mobile games like my Number Ninjas game (on my profile). I'm starting with a little about me to not brag, but to a) give context on why my experience can be useful and b) to hopefully give you encouragement.\n\nAs I'm sifting through the land of Reddit, I see this question come up so many times: should I learn to code? Follow on questions stem from the likes of \"is coding dead with AI,\" \"what programming language should I use\", \"Java or dotnet\", etc. Just this week with casual browsing, these all popped up on my feed.\n\n  \nLet me break this up into parts:\n\n**1) Should I learn to code?**\n\nThis is a problem that needs to be reframed at a deeper level involving your relationship with problems in life. There are two things we can encounter:\n\n1) Solving an existing problem\n\n2) Choosing better problems (or creating a good \"problem\")\n\n  \nThink about the last time you were stuck on something. How motivated were you to fix it? When you hit roadblocks, did you just want to throw in the towel, or did you stick with it and feel REALLY good after making a breakthrough.\n\n  \nWriting software isn't linear or not even always predictable. There will be good days. There will be days where things break, you have setbacks, and it may take WAY more time than you planned for. It requires patience, resilience and a strong mindset.\n\nI'll be honest with you. Coding is VERY polarizing. If you don't love it, you'll hate it. There really isn't much in between. Going back to problems in life, a big part of your success in life isn't living a problem-free life, but choosing better problems to have. Code is a weird dichotomy: you solve world problems by creating interesting, fun problems in the making.\n\n  \n**2) Is coding dead with AI? Will it take my job?**\n\nThere are many strong opinions on this. My personal one is that if you don't see AI as a companion versus a threat, you will be phased out. Like many things in life, mindset matters. I remember being out of shape and always being envious of people who \"seemed\" to have it \"easier\" by being in shape...until I put in the work and started crushing it myself.\n\n  \nAI is no different. You will need to be more of a \"unicorn\" software developer these days that does \"more than their job\" used to be just a few years ago. Life has adapted quite a bit. It's faster and it's automated. You can either let it make you bitter or better. Use AI, embrace it. But also embrace the fact that AI is FAR from perfect. Make yourself irreplaceable in your craft by being \"that dev\" that understands the architectural limitations of AI today and how your solutions show why AI can't be solely relied on. Sure, you can't guarantee you'll never lose a job BUT you are in charge of your growth and becoming the best you can be. Heck, you can then make your own apps like I have with the help of AI.\n\n  \n**3) What programming language should I use?**\n\nVery nuanced. Do you know what kind of job space you are looking at (mobile apps, security, etc)? Certain programming paradigms and even languages may be better or worse. Are you simply looking for an easy language? Sure, start with Python. My answer isn't the best or the right one for everyone, and that's the point: there's no perfect answer to this. You just need to dive into SOMETHING, write code ,make mistakes, and LEARN from them. It's just like when I was starting my math YouTube channel: instead of obsessing over making the first perfect video, many Youtubers talked about not overthinking it and to just build that muscle memory. DO SOMETHING!!!\n\n  \nJava vs dotnet? I saw this question recently. I know both. I prefer dotnet. Why? I just do? I love the IDE I use and the tech stack a bit more (big fan of Rider IDE btw). But again, your choice may be different\n\n  \nI hope this gives you some things to think about. Reframe those questions, really hone in on your relationship with problem solving, and just dive right in! All the best and God bless!\n\nIs your motivation simply money: I promise you, that's very fleeting and won't keep you entertained. I've met so many people, both in college and beyond, where they chased coding as the next big thing and the pay it provides, only to experience burnout and pivot entirely.\n\n  \nHere's an interesting problem for you. Imagine I gave you 9 pennies and just one of the pennies weighs slightly more than the other pennies. You're given a weight scale where you can put any number of pennies on one side. One weigh means comparing the weight of the pennies on both sides and the scale will tell you some outcome: both sides way the same, the left side weighs more or the right. Each time you perform this measurement, that counts as a turn.\n\n  \nBeginner programmer question: make an app to figure out which penny weighs the most. Given the assumption that penny exists, your program must ALWAYS choose the CORRECT penny.\n\n  \nDoes this problem sound fun to you? If you were to take a pause right now and try and figure it out, what's your experience (\"good\" frustration, annoyance, wanting to really figure this out)? A simple \"problem\" like this can tell you a lot about your relationship with problem solving, the heart of coding. Believe me, there are days I get frustrated trying to figure out what's wrong, but it's a \"good\" frustration. Once solved, I still get that joy 20 years later.\n\nBtw, bonus problem: can you guarantee that program takes as few turns as possible :)\n\n",

If salt is randomly created even if for same password how can it verify the password entered after being stored in the database with the hashed password that DB contains. If the salt is random and different each time, how can it recreate the same hash to compare with the login password?\n\nI take time to search online and stumbled upon some explanations and I think bcrypt somehow ( I don't understand the how part as well ) stores the salt along with the hash string itself, then reuses it during comparison with the new password but I’m not 100% sure if I’ve understood it correctly and it feels like I haven't understand the core concept of this Bcrypt password hashing.

Everytime someone brings an example of why A is better than B, there is the caveat of \"you COULD do it with B, but it's not designed for it\". Why would I care? In the end, isn't every language just a tool box which gets filled more and more with every update? And now to the actual question:\n\nCan you give me examples of where some feature is not implemented in a language because it would directly block another feature? At the moment I have the impression that every language is able to do anything, just that the speed with which stuff is implemented by the maintainer differs. So it's basically just historical differences in Syntax?",

        "content": "Hello everyone, I have a feeling this is a common complaint, but I need help. Please point me to the right direction, I want to learn.\n\n  \nI have been learning programming on and off for years in an amateur setting (way before AI). I understand the basics. I have successfully completed small projects for my previous company (websites, small apps, basic games), however whenever I try applying these basics to build something useful, I have no idea where to start.\n\nI feel like im stuck in a loop learning variable types, loops, classes, etc, but none of this translates to a real programming job. I have the pieces of the puzzle but I don't know how to put them together. When I search for help or advice online, all I get is the same basic tutorials explaining how to do a while loop.\n\n  \nI have recently applied to a junior position for Python dev, and the small exam they had was... overwhelming.\n\nThey gave me a bunch of files and 2 hours, told me to implement some new classes, refactor some old ones, and I... had no idea where to start. Which file do I even open? Where do I write?\n\nI looked at it as a donkey would look at a palace - I can't even begin to comprehend what is going on. At this defining moment, all of my hours of practicing and building small projects amount to nothing.\n\n  \nThis has been a constant in my programming journey. I keep trying to learn, I see a bunch of tutorials and classes, learn the beginner 10% of programming building blocks but It never progresses into anything. I feel like I will never be able to progress. I feel like a fraud, like I'm wasting my life.\n\nI want to learn and do something with this knowledge.\n\nSo, questions:\n\n* Can anyone tell me how you passed this barrier? Was it even a barrier for you, or is it just me? Did it just click one day randomly? Is there a website/resource/material that helps with this?\n* On a side note, can you tell me tips on landing a programming job and preparing for it? I'm not even worried about salary, just want to get some experience in a real scenario.\n\n  \nJust as a quick info I think some people will ask - I didn't go to university and I don't have a degree - I am an older guy and its hard to do it now. I know you learn a lot there but it's not very viable for me since I have to still pay rent and put food on the table. I understand that miracles are impossible and without traditional education on this it will be harder. I'm willing to go the extra mile to learn though.",

        "content": "Hey folks,\n\nI’ve been learning JavaScript and recently came across the class keyword. I understand that classes in JS are basically syntactic sugar over constructor functions and prototypes, but it made me wonder:\n\nDo we actually need to use classes in modern web development?\n\nWhat situations make them the better choice compared to just using functions, closures, or factory functions?\n\nAre there real-world examples where classes are more practical/cleaner, or is it more of a “preference/style” thing?\n\nFor example, when working with React, I see a lot of older codebases with class components, but nowadays everyone seems to prefer functional components with hooks. Similarly, in vanilla JS, I often wonder if using a class for, say, managing state or UI logic is overkill compared to just using functions.\n\nWould love to hear from those of you who have worked on production-level projects:\n👉 Do you use classes regularly?\n👉 If so, where do they really shine in web development?\n\nThanks in advance!",

I have a service class and I feel like mapping there isn't the right place for it.\n\nSay I have this set (pseudocode):\n\n    class GenericModel {\n    \n    private string _a;\n    private string _b;\n    private string _c;\n    private string _d;\n    private string _e;\n    private string _f;\n    \n    // Getters and setters\n    \n    }\n\nAnd then we map a subset to DTO:\n\n    class GenericDTO {\n    \n    private string _a;\n    private string _b;\n    private string _c;\n    \n    // Getters and setters\n    \n    }\n\nIf we want to use the service in the controller and have it as output, then this mapping makes sense, but sometimes want to use a service class in another service/business logic class.\n\nIf we have already mapped to DTO in the service class, then this class will always return DTO and we limit ourselves data we might need in other classes.\n\nTherefore, a service class should return the full model object and when we want to return the client a request response, we should use the DTO to return a flat and simple data set, so the mapping should be done in the controller class.\n\nI don't know how other people view this, but in my opinion, this should be the way to go, except if you are sure that you are always going to return the DTO in the controller response to the client.\n\nNote: DTO should be a simple class.",

I'm currently a junior in highschool, and with college looming on the horizon, I really want to make some personal practice projects and get internships to help with my chances of getting into one of my dream colleges. There are a few coding extracurriculars I'm involved in but want to step up into a true leadership role. Extracurriculars is my main focus, my GPA, grades, and test scores are stellar, I just have to add that personal bit. Now, enough with the rambling. I'm struggling to code because I rely to much on AI to help me solve stuff and make projects. Anything I make doesn't seem authentic and I don't feel like I'm actually learning anything and learning to solve problems, and I seriously feel like a failure in the field I'm interested, and I'm also worried about future job prospects with AGI and replacement being potentially in the near future. I want to make cool projects and stuff, but I usually start, and then get stuck on something I don't know how to solve. I really don't know how to approach certain projects I make, for instance, I want to make a 2D tennis game sort of like the NES version of Tennis but I have no idea where to start, how to add collisions stuff like that, man, I even got stuck on how to add collision to pong cause I was afraid to look stuff up. I need help, but I don't understand what to do, I really want to get good at programming, my dream one day is to be 10x, but I feel stupid and terrible at coding. What do I do? I'm sorry this is rambling but I'm seriously worried about my future. Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: I have learned Java, C++ and Python, and do robotics and cs club. I just feel like I've only learned theory and such, not actually practical stuff.\n\nEdit2: Hey everyone, I just want to thank ALL of you, except that one guy who suggested vibe coding, for your advice and expertise in helping solve my problem. I feel much better now that I have a solid plan and advice from people who know their stuff. Cheers!",

        "content": "Hey all,\n\nAfter being exposed to teachyourselfCS & asking reddit on what programming was all about, I realize what I cared most about wasn't necessarily learning DSA or designing programs, but gaining domain knowledge to apply it to.\n\nFor example, the difference between a person and JK Rowling is that the former doesn't know how to use english to create stories, yet at least. Ie. The value of knowing the language is that it lets you apply it however you want. (for example, Winston Churchill used english in a different way than JK Rowling).\n\nA programming example is Larry Page. At least, according to Paul Graham, \"The component of entrepreneurship that really matters is domain expertise. The way to become Larry Page was to become an expert on search.\"\n\nMy question is: how much did you know when you built your domain knowledge? ie. what was the process like when you transitioned from \"learning programming\" --> \"solving problems\"?\n\nFor example, my car could break down and I would know it can be solved, but don't know how. Whereas my friend would be able to solve it because he's watched videos to mod his own car -- I suppose the answer is learn whatever you need to solve the problem.\n\nWell, in that case, how do I build an operating system? I want to make the movie Her. I suppose now, it makes sense to use the OS book to build it.\n\nWhat if I want to build a trading platform for AIs? Ie. how do I make a bank for them? Where would I begin here? lol.\n\nMy experience is Replit / LearnCPP. I haven't used programming to solve a problem, besides micro-projects I asked GPT for. What I need help with now is understanding how you all built your domain expertise.\n\nThanks!",

Speaking of the course, the explanations are no doubt good because Harry explains well, however, it's clearly not worth 2900 and I'll tell the reasons I feel that way:\n\nYou don't learn programming by just good explanations, you learn by solving more and more problems on a topic from basic to advanced. The problem in his courses is that in many sections, for example NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. There are just pure lectures and handbooks of the lectures. No questions to practice or use the things you learn in a lecture.\n\nResult? You have to search for questions yourself, filter for the basics to intermediate to advanced level questions and that would be scattered, which means , not curated to what you learnt after every lecture. And that is the second major part of why people prefer courses. It's for the ease of getting resources for practice curated to the teachings step by step.\n\nI've been a part of the Pierian Data Science Course on Udemy too, and the two MAJOR plus points of it were first, it had after every few lectures, practice questions, and that too on an integrated ipynb jupyter kernel on the website itself so you can do it then and there. And the second, the site allows you to take notes of yourself on any part of the video. And I got this course for 900/- only(on the udemy sale days which happen once a while quite often) which is more than 3 times cheaper than CWH Data Science course.\n\nAnd lastly, the course's availability is only for a timeframe, not lifetime access.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I recently deployed my Java Springboot backend on Render.com. However, after deployment, I noticed that events on my calendar page (frontend built with Next.js) are showing up a few hours off, sometimes even making the events show up on the wrong day. (like before it was 18th 9:00PM and now it is 19th 1:00 AM.\n\nAfter checking my MongoDB data, I saw that the dates are stored in UTC. I'm not sure if I'm explaing this right but here is what I think: when I had localhost backend, everything rendered fine because I was using LocalDateTime, which used my system's local time. But after deploying, the server uses UTC, so the LocalDateTime no longer reflects my actual timezone and that’s why things are off.\n\nHow can I fix this? I read some articles and they said to use OffsetDateTime as the date object type in the backend and then in the frontend i format the date i recieve with the javascript Date object  tto get the right date on the calendar.\n\nIs this the right approach or are other approaches better? (i'm not really sure about this as I don't have much experience).\n\nThanks!\n\n",

        "content": "Is Dijkstra's algorithm still widely used for shortest path problem? Reason being is I (small background in programming for GPUs but not a CS major) recently learned Dijkstra's algorithm while checking out LeetCode for the first time and thought it was awfully serial looking. I'm guessing that there is some other algorithm which is actually used in industry since GPU zoomies often beat mathematical efficiency. Anyways, I took a stab at making a parallel version of the algorithm and wondered if these numbers look any good (basically should I write a paper on it). Total function calls scales worse than serial Dijkstra (obviously) but total parallel iterations (can be done in parallel in a thread-safe manner) does quite well. I am generating these graphs using a random graph generator.\n\nResults below are a check if answers are the same for all nodes (both codes find shortest paths from A to all other points since that's how Gemini decided to write Dijkstra's algorithm so I followed suite).

I designed this project with my friend as a non-profit organisation that we could write on our common apps. I know HTML, CSS and very minimal JS, but not enough to code a website for both frontend or backend. Im going to host the server through Netlify, Vercel or Cloudflare pages, and obtain and try to get a 5-6$ domain off cloudflare registrar since I've heard they only have ICANN cost and some other minimal costs. The thing is, Idrk how to code JS and Ive never really had any JS projects in the past. My website will have a minimal backend, no login/registration, just a dashboard explaining the site, and hyperlinks to different subjects and tutorials My friend has recorded. I was wondering if it would be possible to use AI 'vibecoding' tools like v0, cursor, perplexity, claude, gpt to help me learn and use JS alongside framer and figma for the UI design. Although ive seen these tools making extremely basic websites I really dont believe they can build a semi-decent functional website that can have traffic of upto 10-15 people without encountering issues. Even with the assistance of these tools, I dont think I myself would be able to make a good frontend either so im wondering whats the best way for me to do this project. I need this project to be done in a month, Im open to using WordPress or Wix if push comes to shove. Thank you for any assistance, and I hope something works out for me in the end.\n\n(The only programming ik is C up until OOP, so im kind of using this project as an excuse to force myself to learn javascript)",

        "content": "Hey, so I wanted to get a sense of how should I approach this.\nI’ve taken a drop year and decided to make most out of it. All I want is being the guy who does some sort of technical work.\n\nIt’s been around 2 months since the decision. So far I spent most of my time on YouTube, mainly CS50 playlist + tutorials on HTML, CSS, JS, Python (bro code channel). On the practice side I tried writing the code tutor writes just to understand better.\n\nAlso made a small site with HTML, little CSS, wrote some JS logic for form submission using Google Appscript, and for Python wrote a script that saved me hours of manual work (basically extracting mails from long videos). Felt good to actually use code for my own need.\n\nThen in the last 2 weeks I wanted to be more focused, so I came across OSSU. Started it, been watching, reading, and solving problem sets. What I understood is OSSU community curated a CS curriculum which is kind of equivalent to a CS program, and they say it takes 13–30 months (42 courses).\n\nNow here’s the thing: I do spend around 12h a day on desk, not just tutorials/practice but also hardware related videos. Planning to get electronics starter kit too.\n\nBut still I feel like, am I doing it right? Like after so many tutorials I still need help from LLMs while writing some Python logic (not for solving full problem sets but just small things). Is this normal?\n\nLeaving that aside, I wanted to know if I’m going in right direction or if there’s a more efficient/better path. My expectations are kinda crazy high, I want to get some technical job or work on some big project by the end of this.\n\nWould appreciate some perspective from people who’ve gone through self-learning / OSSU / drop year like me.\n",

        "content": "Hey everyone, new poster and new to Python programming. I've been learning Python through 23 Mooc and have been having this annoying pestering itch in the back of my head that I'm doing something wrong.\n\nAs soon as I hit a wall with my code, I open up MSpaint and try to logic through the problem. Most of the questions on Mooc seem to be heavily math/logic based so that's the approach I try to go for. The problem is that, even though I end up getting the output correct, my code feels janky or \"brute-forcey\". For instance, one problem asked me to collect a user generated number, then print out each number from 1 -> that number but alternating between the next highest, back down to the next lowest (sorry if that's a bad explanation; kind of like this: {[input: 5] : 1, 5, 2, 4, 3})\n\nMy code ended up looking like this:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ninput_number = int(input(\"Please type in a number: \"))\n\ncounter = 1\n\nalternating_number = input_number - 1\n\nindex = 1 \n\nwhile (index * 2) <= input_number:\n\n    print(index) \n\n    index += alternating_number \n\n    print(index) \n\n    alternating_number -= 1 \n\n    index -= alternating_number \n\n    alternating_number -= 1 \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBut oh dang! When I input an odd number, it cuts off right before the last number gets printed. So I open up MSpaint again and find a pattern regarding the odd numbers. So I add this code to the end:\n\nodd_helper = 0\n\nwhile counter <= input_number:\n\n    if counter % 2 != 0:\n\n        odd_helper += 1\n\n        odd_numbers = odd_helper\n\n    counter += 1\n\n\nif input_number % 2 != 0:\n\n    print(input_number - (odd_numbers - 1))\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd the program works as expected, and succeeds the tests. After all that time spending solving it, it still feels wrong, kind of like I cheated an answer out. After looking at the model solution, their example is so clear, concise, and makes perfect sense. I guess my ultimate question for you guys is: is a janky solution that still works good enough, even if that solution feels like you're cheating?",

So I made it, and there you go :)\n\nThe flowchart itself I put here: [https://imgur.com/a/nTBYfNW](https://imgur.com/a/nTBYfNW)\n\nBut it kinda lacks details and explanations, so the video that talks through it, is here: [https://youtu.be/QbwDyybmx4U](https://youtu.be/QbwDyybmx4U)\n\nIn summary:\n\n\\- if you want to learn about databases and go deep and system level, do native installer, then package manager.\n\n\\- If you don't want to learn anything, just need an easy way to use a database and you have a Mac, then [Postgres.app](http://Postgres.app)\n\n\\- If you have Linux and more serious aspirations for app development, then go Docker, then Docker Compose, and then a managed cloud service\n\n\\- And if you're not sure, go back to the first option - native installer, and decide later...\n\nLet me know how did you do it? Would you do it differently now?",

Being calm is the actual cheat code.**\n\nI'm 4 years deep at a big tech company, and work-life balance has been absolutely brutal lately. For the past year, I went full psycho mode—trying to crush every single task, racing through my backlog, saying yes to everything.\n\n**Plot twist: It made me objectively worse at my job.**\n\nHere's what I didn't expect: When you're constantly in panic mode, your nervous system goes haywire. You become that coworker who's stressed, short with people, and honestly just not fun to be around.\n\n**And here's the kicker—being pleasant to work with is literally the most important skill in Big Tech.**\n\nThink about it: The people who get shit done aren't grinding alone in a corner. They're the ones other people WANT to help. They get faster code reviews. They get invited to the important meetings. They get context shared with them freely.\n\nWhen you're stressed and snappy? People avoid you. Your PRs sit in review hell. You get excluded from decisions. You end up working 2x harder for half the impact.\n\n**The counterintuitive solution: Embrace strategic calm.**\n\nI started doing less. I stopped panic-working. I took actual lunch breaks. I said \"I'll get back to you tomorrow\" instead of dropping everything.\n\nResult? My productivity went UP. My relationships improved. My manager started praising my \"executive presence.\"\n\n**In Big Tech, your nervous system IS your competitive advantage.** Stay calm, stay likeable, and watch opportunities come to you instead of chasing them down like a maniac.\n\nAnyone else discover this the hard way?",

I decided to apply to FAANG thinking that I probably won't get an interview anyways but I somehow got it and somehow passed it and now I'm making more money than I've ever dreamed of. \n\nI have 4 YoE at a startup where I wore many hats and learned an incredible amount of things but at the end of the day, it was still a very small startup serving a few hundred users. Everything I did could've been boiled down to simple CRUD work with some business logic sprinkled in, that you could learn from a Udemy course. So when I was joining, I was extremely scared and thought that I wouldn't be good enough because I felt like I was in the minor leagues and now I was coming up to the big leagues so of course the stakes are higher, pay is amazing, the work will be more intense, etc.\n\nHowever to be honest it feels like not much has changed. I know I'm only a few months in but I'm working on things ranging from minor tickets to full blown apps and it's still the same CRUD work I used to do. In fact here, so many things are abstracted away that I don't need to worry about a ton of things so it feels even easier. That comes with having to setup a ton of boilerplate to create a simple route, but seeing how other routes have it setup basically lets you know all you need to know.\n\nObviously there's issues regarding scale as I never had to worry about it, but again it's as straightforward as saying I want this new data model to be shared by having a keyword and boom, everything is taken care of. It's honestly incredible. So all that to say, I've realized that I've never felt comfortable or \"safe\" yet, like I'm almost waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like is this it? Is it really this straightforward and I was worried for nothing? Or does it truly get more challenging and complex as you go and I just haven't been here long enough to see that.",

Training and running these models costs a fortune. All the big boys are fighting to become THE definitive AI provider adopted by the corporates. Its looking like it might be Microsoft with its Co-pilot integration. And one things that Microsoft is famous for is getting you fully integrated into their stack and then whacking the prices up. The AI providers will have no choice once the infinite investor money hose stops. Once that happens I wonder exactly how much AI will be saving them money when they are having to pay massive licencing fees, and per-token costs increasing into the dollars, rather than the pennies like right now.\n\nA similar situation is happening with a lot of companies Cloud bills increasing massively. In fact, a lot of companies are looking for way to bring things back on prem and regretting their decisions. Many companies wish they could move back on prem, but can't afford to due to getting rid of all their infrastructure guys and the cost of migrating back being too much.\n\nI am thinking that should AI replace entire dev teams, a lot of these companies will regret it when the rug-pull happens. \n\n",

In one place Grok mentioned that my reasoning was fallacious do to circular reasoning, but apparently circular reasoning not as it's commonly understood in any logic textbook, (and therefore, not actually fallacious for the same reason).

Like man I'm only 5 weeks in. This is not a rant post (well kinda cuz it's just an intern) though, I just wanna know if there's any reflection I can get out of this. My leader told me my progress was not as good as he expected to be, and that I'm lacking communication, etc, and more closely they decided to hire someone else with years of experience, not to replace me but to work on completely different part. In a nutshell, they feel like my part is not good enough so they kinda give up and work on other things to raise opportunity for the funding round, at least from my understanding. I won't go deep into my work, but basically I'm developing a huge part of the project from stratch to a workable demo, which involves sub system and sub sub system, etc etc. they're blaming me for not talking with my colleagues enough, but I'm essentially doing this R&D work all alone. From what I know, they made the decision to pause whatever I'm working on cuz they feel like it's far from good enough for the funding round demo, to \"save the money to hire somebody else to work another more promising end of the product\". I wonder if this is common for early startup, not the fact that they hired a summer intern as one of the earliest employees, but do huge change on product features for the demo. Other than this, I'll greatly appreciate any advice on my case, did I dodged a bullet, etc. Personally, I can definitely improve the communication part even though it's pretty much useless for my work, but all my colleagues got all these meetings I don't need to attend, so they're pretty much occupied with talking to investors, suppliers, etc etc all these \"big things to solved\".

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI graduated about 2 months ago and decided to take a month off because finishing my degree was really stressful. Right now, I’m working at one of the most popular restaurants in NYC, making around **$115k working just 4 days a week**. This job put me through college and helped me graduate debt-free, which I’m super thankful for. Before this, the most I ever made was around $50k a year at any other restaurant, so this income honestly feels unreal.\n\nBut being honest, seeing all the millionaires who dine here, I really want to break into the field I studied. I don’t want to be the server forever, I want to be the one being served, like those customers.\n\nThat said, I never got an internship during college. I started at community college and thought internships were only for people already in a bachelor’s program. By the time I transferred, I felt like my projects weren’t strong enough, and I missed opportunities. Senior year came and went without an internship too.\n\nNow I’m job hunting. I’ve applied to 100+ positions this past month (mostly C++ and Python roles — C++ is really my strong suit). I do have some better projects now, but the market feels brutal. I’m not sure if I should set a “limit” on how long to keep applying before focusing my energy elsewhere.\n\nI love the restaurant job I have now, and I never expected it to be this lucrative, but at the same time, I don’t want to feel like I wasted 4 years of my life on my degree.\n\nSo my question is, has anyone here broken into tech with a similar background (no internships, starting a bit late)? I’d love to hear your stories or advice.\n\n**TL;DR:** Graduated 2 months ago with no internships, applying to 100+ jobs (C++/Python). Currently making $115k working 4 days a week at a top NYC restaurant. Love the money, but want to break into tech, has anyone succeeded in a similar situation?",

        "author": "InsaneAdoration",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "Sorry if this sounds a bit of a rant, but I just passed the 4 YOE mark and am now starting to get extremely anxious over (how I feel anyway) not having learned much of anything/developed any skills as a SWE. I just need some hard truths/perspective/advice.\n\nI work for a company that is essentially a defense contractor (though not in the traditional sense). Started off at 90k with mid year and end of year raises. Am now at 132k. However, now that I look back, I feel like I haven’t learned much of anything. Listed below are the projects that I’ve worked through at my job:\n\n1. Started off by supporting a study/analysis where I was basically taking existing MatLab scripts, writing my own scripts, and cobbling them together (all in MatLab - no other tools/software) to generate, process, and manipulate data for analysis. Learned about a lot of stuff like Kalman filters, linear algebra, and math related etc, but Not software engineering - just a lot of MatLab scripting\n\n2. We received a black box software that needed to be installed and ran on my workplaces systems (including on a HPC). I had to get it running (as in, hit the executable and not have it crash). All I really did was make sure the .so files were properly linked, set up a few text config files, and figure out the right terminal command to input to get it running on the HPC. Pretty much no programming whatsoever.\n\n3. This was setting up a GitLab CI/CD for an existing project. Essentially, setting up the virtual machine for the runner, configuring the GitLab file to build and run, as well as creating a python script that analyzed unit/regression test outputs for correctness (automatically called by the runner). No real programming.\n\n4. What I consider to be my first actual large SWE project. However, the tech stack was pretty much non-existent. It was essentially a message based, event driven simulation in C++. The “database” was just a folder of CSV’s that were read in. I did create framework to connect to a MySQL server and/or SQLite server as alternatives to access the same data (learned more about abstract classes, etc). The build process was just a bunch of Make scripts (deadass just pure, rawdog Make scripts). I did implement new features, but frankly speaking, the code base was awful. The simulation framework itself was decent and I occasionally touched it, but the actual processing of events/messages was incredibly convoluted (culmination of literal generations of technical debt). I honestly felt like I was back in College, creating random ass functions and just writing huge chunks of code because to try and refactor it all was just not feasible. I did get some experience also writing BOOST unit/regression tests. \n\n5. This was another simulation project. However, I was far less involved with the actual framework/architecture of the simulation. I mainly worked on algorithms for what was actually being simulated. IE, I did not have to think too much about classes, design philosophy. There was literally just an empty place holder function for some functionality, and I just had to come up with an algorithm to produce that functionality (think guidance and control for vehicles).\n\n6. This is what I consider to be the most “SWE” project so far (and is my current one). It’s essentially a Java desktop App (built as a Maven project) with JavaFx front end and pure Java back end. I’m still new to this project, but seeing how it’s been programmed, it looks beautiful with really clean/elegant code, though I couldn’t even explain WHY that code is clean/elegant (just the vibes). Learned more about socket connections and JavaFX. However, even in this project, we don’t really use all those full stack technologies you hear about like Kubernetes, React, Docker (I’ve also had to create Docker images before but not as part of like a larger tech stack).\n\nEssentially, I feel like nearly all of my experience has just been about hammering out code. I haven’t really touched any of that “tech stack” stuff I hear a lot about. Furthermore, just looking at how some of that code (#6) is written makes me realize that even when it comes to just hammering out code, I’m doing it in a very “College Undergraduate With a Vague Semblance of Best Practices” way instead of the clean/elegant (albeit complicated because I don’t understand all of the language’s features) way I witnessed. And don’t even get me started on system design. I know legit nothing about system design (aside from general terms like protocol, load balancing, etc).\n\nIs this normal for someone with a whole 4YOE to know this little? If not, how can I improve? I know the best way is to “create projects on your own time”, but are there any resources that that can give me starting pointers? Like a “suppose you want to create a full stack application that does whatever, here is every tech you need and how they relate” so I can at least fill out the details by myself in a project? Or what about resources that I can learn regarding elegant code (for example, I’ve been reading Effective Java 3rd Edition).",

Then a few weeks back he suddenly drops a bombshell, that I'm not performing to the level of expectations for a \"senior\" developer. And most of the reasons he gave are rather vague, ie not being \"independent\" enough, asking too many questions, etc. ie nothing to do with my work or getting stuff done. Then it just escalated, he started complaining about my pull requests with more vague things like \"why did you do it X way when Y way would have been better?\" Note that during all this time I just took it all in and never argued or tried to defend myself, because most of the things he mentioned are vague ie how do I respond to being told that I ask too many questions?

        "content": "I was laid off from a job relatively recently. It was my first job out of college and it was at a small company. I wasn't included in meetings that decided my work and I was handed tasks from the lead dev, usually in the form of a paragraph with a visual and that was about it. I'd be told \"lets see what you come up with\" and from there I'd have to do my own research and planning. The lead dev already had a full idea of what the project should be, its requirements, and specifications and I would be penalized if what I came up with didn't line up with what he had. I essentially worked in a bubble and only had interactions once in a while, essentially starting projects from scratch. When I asked questions, I'd basically be given a 20 question knowledge check and denied answers if I didn't think the same way a dev with 10 years of experience did. I basically hit a point where my default assumption is that I'm always wrong. I was basically laid off for not operating like a dev with 10 years of experience because the assumption management and the lead dev had was that 3 years should mean I'm, on par with the lead dev. I also had no mentorship while on the job after the first 2-3 weeks.\n\nI guess I went in with the preconceived notion from college that there would be more collaboration and discussion on tasks and have a clear image of how a project should work what it should do and why before even starting to code. \n\nThe expectation my manager laid out in my last few months was \"You've been here for 3 years, you shouldn't need to work with anyone on projects, you should be able to take projects yourself and do them by yourself.\" I was then put on a big project that involved reworking a ton of code to be sent externally and me asking for stand up meetings to make sure I'm in expectations was considered a negative point against me. \n\nIs this just a standard developer experience, full on trial by fire every day and if you aren't solving every issue, it means you've failed as a developer? I'm assuming I'm just a bad developer who's not capable of handling this line of work because I need direction. ",

I’ve managed to keep the “doom and gloom” at bay for years, but today it finally got to me. I had a full-blown meltdown and broke down sobbing to my wife.\n\nMy fear is that all of this hard work will be for nothing—that I’ll graduate, struggle to find a job, and end up back in my current field (trucking) or working a random service job just to make ends meet.\n\nI’ve overcome a lot in my life: homelessness as a teenager, extensive childhood trauma, and growing up in a very rough environment. I have a beautiful wife whom I love dearly and a daughter in high school (I became a parent as a teenager). I’m doing this for them—and for me. But right now, it feels like the many lost hours, the stress of working full-time, and the emotional labor of supporting my family might end up being a waste.\n\nI love coding. I love the problem-solving—it’s like virtual Legos to me. More than anything, I want to build a stable career doing something I love, while providing for my family. But with all the negative voices out there, I’m starting to doubt if there’s any hope in this industry.\n\nShould I stay the course? Could my CS degree be leveraged into something adjacent like cybersecurity if the market is too tight? Or am I setting myself up for disappointment?\n\nSorry for the wall of text—just in a very dark place right now.",

        "author": "SomeRandomCSGuy",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "A while back, I made a post about how developing soft skills (alongside coding) helped me build visibility, trust, and alignment at work and eventually get promoted to senior much faster than others. You can check it out in my posts history if you are interested.\n\nOne of the most common questions I got on that post was around how I developed my spoken communication skills because I think that is what a majority of engineers struggle with, so decided to make a separate post about it.\n\nFor context, I have grown up very introverted and shy. Always have had trouble with clear spoken communication - I used to stutter, use too many filler words, lose track of thought etc, which really affected my confidence and made me want to stay quiet most of the times, even during meetings. I always used to think that this skill was reserved for extroverted people and naturals. Boy, was I wrong\n\nThis year I decided to do something about it. Since I was an introvert and used to be holed up in my apartment most of the time away from people, I used to spend an ungodly amount of time on Youtube lol. I noticed that some YouTubers that I had been following for a couple years, were just so charismatic, articulate, authentic and genuine but when I went back and saw some of their old videos, they were completely different - awkward, and ineloquent. Kind of made me realize that the fact that they had been making videos for so long, they have been training their speaking muscle over and over again, and over time got immensely good at it.\n\nThis gave me the idea to try doing something similar. So I slowly started recording myself speaking to the phone camera. I wasn’t the most consistent with it but slowly overtime I slowly started seeing progress. I used to just talk / ramble about anything (my day, experiences etc) just to get comfortable and tried to keep speaking for at least 5 mins.\n\nI even started YouTube channels to keep myself accountable to keep practicing and slowly start following a structured pattern  - since at work, during meetings or presentations etc I wasn’t going to just talk about my day etc. I started off with having word for word scripted videos but that was making me come off as really inauthentic. But with consistent practice, overtime I became comfrotable enough to just riff off from the top of my head while having just 2-3 main points in front of me.\n\nThis truly boosted my confidence more than I can put into words!\n\nThis translated directly Into work as well because now I was able to talk a lot more fluently and eloquently, and with confidence + authority. I had fixed my issues - stuttering, losing track of thought, using filler words etc - almost by 80%+.\n\n***TL;DR***  \nRecord yourself speaking daily (even just 5 minutes). It feels awkward at first, but it will transform how you communicate within a couple of months. Speaking really is a muscle.\n\nThanks for reading this long post haha. Hope this helps anyone who’s struggled with speaking up!\n\nHappy to answer any questions in the comments or DMs :)",

        "author": "Dreadsin",
        "subreddit": "cscareerquestions",
        "content": "So I'm *pretty sure* this all started one day where I was given a very large task, basically go through every design and break it down to components, then create a design system from that meeting some requirements. I made a notion doc, shared it, and worked through it. My manager told me to make tickets for it, I said I wasn't yet done with breaking things down, she got really mad and reassigned it to another teammate with no warning so I stopped working on it\n\nShe said (quote) \"\\[redacted\\] will be leading the theming & tokens initiative, but he's on PTO this week. he'll help build out the project w/ its various phases & tickets. i'm creating some tickets with explicit tasks for you to get started\". She then assigned me a small handful of tickets. I didn't totally understand what the actual implication of that new guy being the lead of the project meant, and she didn't explain it, so I figured it just meant \"stop working on this project\". I don't want to ask, because she responds to questions **very** negatively.\n\nWe had a 1:1 where she mentioned a lot of very strange things. She said I should implicitly know what to work on 100% of the time and it's \"not her job\" to give me work to do. One thing that also came up was that I took a ticket which was \"meant\" to be for support, but was actually just sitting at the top of the backlog. To her, this was a really big miss on my part and she wouldn't stop talking about it. To me, I just saw a ticket with high priority on the backlog and grabbed it\n\nSince then, she was downright *aggressive*. I'm talking, every time I put in a pull request she'd rip it apart, but without looking at the code. She'll nitpick the description, the title, pretty much everything but the code. Some were such bizarrely small nitpicks. Prime example, I made a fix for a footer component so my commit message was like \"\\[FE-29\\] {footer} fixes the way images display in dark mode on the footer component\". She said that I really messed up because I didn't include a link to the storybook. I was a bit confused because a bot usually deploys it then comments the link. I asked what she meant, and she said \"I need an EXACT LINK to the footer component in dark mode\", followed by a lot of derisive comments about how I never do anything right. To me, I thought \"it says the component and it says dark mode... just click the link, click footer, and click dark mode...?\". It was never a stated convention that we would have to post a direct link\n\nLater she comments how I'm on \"thin ice\" and how I need to tell her what I'm working on this week. I ask her a few things about prioritization, which I get a lot of non-answers to. So, I get really specific. \"Looking at both the boards, it appears the button component is the next highest priority. Is that right?\", she then explains what the component library *is* as if I haven't been working on it. The only hint is she said \"priority ahead of that is working on your existing PRs\", so it seems like she's saying \"yes, after you finish your existing PRs, do the button\"\n\nFrankly, I'm a bit annoyed with the indirectness so I say \"so should I take the button component? Yes or no?\", which she said \"i'm looking for you to create a weekly work plan w/ prioritized tasks from the available information\". So then I say \"... ok... so I guess I'll take the button?\", and she replied \"i've asked for a weekly work plan — this includes a list of items that you plan to dedicate time to this week\"\n\nSo I gather 4-5 tickets and send them to her. I accidentally didn't include the button (just messed up one link) and before I could even edit, she started berating me and she said she was prepping to put me on PIP. I tried explaining to her, \"the reason I'm asking you this is because you reassigned that project to someone else and told me you'd make tickets for me. Because of that, I thought that you wouldn't want me to blindly take tickets and work on them\". Just the previous week, I got in trouble for taking one of \"her\" tickets, despite the fact that it was sitting in the backlog not assigned to her\n\nI got really frustrated with her at this point and reached out to my previous manager. I said I feel like I can't communicate clearly with this manager, and she set up a meeting with me and the skip. Really, I just can't deal with the leading questions, non answers, \"quizzing\" me, and negative responses to my questions. I feel unable to have an actual conversation with her without inadvertently pissing her off",

        "content": "I've spent a large part of my \"career,\"  doing passable work on existing projects. I was hired at my current position without a relevant degree and the world's tiniest amount of existing work.  I've been in a position for five years. \n\nThe entire time, I vacillated between feeling like I could do anything, and feeling like I was lucky to accomplish what I'd set out to accomplish.  I've always cognitively known that I wasn't as good as a trained professional, but I think I started to lose sight of what that actually meant as time went on.  Add to that the fact that there's simply so much I don't know that I don't know.  \n\nUltimately, I think I've probably been blissfully ignorant.  I used to think that if I spent enough time iterating, I could figure most things out.   I've frequented tutorials, articles and the messing around and finding out I used to do back when I felt I had more time. I've also been leaning hard on AI to learn new tricks.\n\nI've got a few certifications, but I strongly suspect that's because I'm good at testing and preparing to test -- not because I know the content the certifications really ask for.  It's always felt like there was a lot of knowledge that \"real,\" professionals just knew; that the certs assumed.  I think a few superiors of mine have been sort of covering for me?  I'm not sure. But I know I've given them a front row seat to my ignorance and I've seen how they've worked around it.  I don't have those supports anymore.  \n\nIt's led to problems -- poor, inflexible designs when I could do things, and code built on what I could accomplish, not the best tools for the job, when I couldn't.  \n\nRight now, I'm in a position where I have several complex problems on my plate including buggy systems that I've written and all I know is that if I'm lucky enough to solve any of them -- they'll probably be hacked together.\n\n I'm aware at the highest possible level of techniques and practices that would help, but I've never implemented them before, and I won't be able to just \"figure things out.\" anymore.  My job thinks I'm somewhere between mid and senior level, and I just... Am not.  My ego has been all over the place and I think I've been projecting like I was better than I was without being 100% aware of it.  \n\nI'm at the point where I'd quit, if I could.  I don't want to be a hinderance; I'm worried that my coworkers are depending on me, and I'm so burned out from doing everything I can to get by (short of like.... Actually having spent my years of work formally learning) that I can't even be useful in the ways that would ordinarily be expected of me. \n\nTLDR; I'm pretty sure I've been the worst example of a bad, \"hotshot\" dev.\n\nWhere can I go from here? I've been thinking that I've got to let someone know that I'm out of my depth.  I don't want to give my employer a packaged reason to fire me, but I also really don't want to keep on as I am.  The stuff I support deserves better.\n\n",

Reading stories about Amazon workers doing 50-60 hour weeks puts me on pause and I'm hoping this is just the more extreme case and not the norm... and also that it's not this bad in all the big tech companies.\n\nI don't want to end up with that problem where I now have a ton more money, but less free time to be spending and benefiting from that money. Is wanting to not lose my free time a reasonable thing, or are you expected to sacrifice more time in play rather than a work hard play hard scenario? I can just imagine how loud the offices at big tech must be, with their open floor plans, all the beeping machines and music playing from many peoples' desktops. The cacophony of sound and people running across the aisles is not something that I've been used to.",

I am about to start my CS Masters program at good public school (UMD) and am thinking about quitting my job where I feel stuck and see no future.\n\nI currently work at small somewhat dying government contractor company. I've been here for 3 years and I feel like the company been slowly dying: went from 1000 employees when I started to about 80 now, CEO/owner is not taking any pay this year, benefits are being cut, no new contracts, and list can go on. I've started as intern working with CEO 3 years ago and later moved into more of team lead position/developer position. Working with CEO introduced me to lots of cool tech and experiences, I went from student with 0 level of experience to someone who can lead teams and develop products. While I loved the experience - my income hasn't changed since I started 3 years ago and as for now I make only $40k/year. \n\nI've been doing great at school. Graduated this spring and was offered admission to CS Masters program at UMD which came with some financial offer (free tuition plus $1500k/month stipend) for at least 1 semester. I also got an offer to work for a lab (actually a few of them). Those labs look very promising and if that work out I might be able to get a research position that would cover my tuition for the whole time. \n\nHere is the conflict I have. While I don't feel like my job can help me to grow - I do like being employed, being paid, having health insurance and gaining the experience. On the other hand - I see lots of opportunities within academia and putting time and effort into working and networking might help me to secure much better position later. \n\nTL;DR: Is it a bad idea quiting tech job with no future for Masters hoping to get better career afterwards?

That day was my first time being laid off.\n\nSo when I was job hunting, I made sure to target more established companies this time as I thought it would bring me more stability. During interviews, I specifically asked about company stability related questions. For example, I asked questions about how often layoff occurs and about the length of the tenure of the employees on the team. The hiring manager gave me the usual spiel about how yes, they'd had layoffs the previous year, but my role would be \"more secure\" since those cuts mainly hit non-dev positions. When I asked about team tenure, the interviewers gave the impression that the people had been there for years.\n\nToday, my director messaged asking if I had \"a moment to chat\" and I knew I was about to be cut. It's the same dance as last year where manager suddenly requested a meeting with me. The director told me it wasn't performance orientated as 15% of the company got laid off but I still feel like maybe if I was better at my job I would be one of the \"safe\" people.\n\nI spent the rest of the day doing damage control on my finances, cancelling the subscriptions I don't need, trying to get my head straight. The timing just feels particularly brutal because my team has been grinding through overtime these past few weeks, pulling extra hours just to so we can finish our project on time and meet our side of the service level agreement.\n\nAll those late nights, all that extra effort and for what? It's exhausting as none of it seems to matter in the end. After my first layoff my confidence in my programming skills already took a fall and now I sometimes feel that maybe I don't have the skills to succeed and they're just cutting the weak links.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone will read this but I wanted to post it here if anyone has any guidance.",

The last year my role has changed to something that looks nothing like my skillset and certainly not my area of talent.  I was given the chat of \"We don't have enough work anymore in what you do, so you have to expand to stay relevant.\"  Fair, ok.\n\nTrouble is, I was immediately thrown into accelerated deadlines with no training. PMs recently were given more power due to trying to fix financial issues in the company.  Basically, we charge clients a few lump sums of work and don't technically have billable hours.  We track billable hours internally just to make sure things are still profitable.  I got throw onto not one but two projects in which either the client misinterpreted the work and a non-technical person put together the contract which led to a loss.  Or, the PMs made promises that couldn't be kept and tried to be technical and then tried to cover by forcing terrible deadlines (asking for 6 weeks of work in 4 days sort of nonsense).\n\nI've been getting whiplash and it's effected me negatively.  Upper management doesn't like how to push back on timelines while at the same time stating that engineers tell the PMs what a reasonable timeline is and then reneg and support impossible goals.  I keep asking for time to work on some training so I can do the new work, ask questions and actually make it my skillset (no, I can't do it in me free time, this is not a skillset that can be googled, it's purely mentored skills only, thing post-quantum crypto analysis activities in alignment with niche security standards in specific nations).\n\nI have been compensating for this lack of time being given on projects or training by working weekends...the last four.  I've been 1-2 days behind on all my tasks even with long days and working weekends.  I'm doing my best when management won't listen to me.\n\nFriday I saw the lab director looking at my work, he voiced he was upset I said work was done by 5PM when he found gaps.  Our lead wasn't going to look at it until Monday, and I am spending the weekend making up the GAPs.\n\nThey taught me that asking for the extra time was pushed back on.  That the works \"should get done during the week\" while also \"recognizing the time constraints are a challenge.\" I cannot win.  I figure it's better to ask for forgiveness then permission.  I am giving of myself.\n\nBut my direct manager basically gave me a heads up that upper management is pissed and reactive right now. \n\nI have four deadlines next week on three other projects and I got scheduled for 5 hours of meetings with ominous titles.  \n\nI am working on an exit strategy but am in the \"hurry up and wait\" for a clearance related job. There are four labs in the world that do what we do: none are hiring right now.  This is a VERY niche area of tech.\n\nTrying to keep calm, work up a game plan. I'm biding my time until I leave.  I hate that I have to have the conversation again of, \"I am compensating the best I can for poor timelines, but you're still getting quality of work.  You won't OK more work days, get offended when I honestly log my hours for weekends, I'm salaried, you don't pay me more for it. You tell me engineers determine timelines, but allow the PMs to reject and reset them.  Everyone is so overworked that no mentoring is available and we're getting more and more work outside of our individual scopes because you fired 70% of the lab in January. Please give me a clear and consistent response on what you need me to do, and I'll do it.\"\n\nObjectively I am just in the time period of despair for some companies where management is failing hard and good workers can't compensate for their own ignorance and inconsistencies anymore. But I'm struggling.  I have some real life things going on too, two deaths in the family in the last month, suing my insurance, husband had surgery, trying to squeak out some joy for myself...but I'm just drowning.  I've been using my PTO liberally but it's going towards errands, those life things, and I even used a few to \"catch up on work without anyone talking to me.\"  I know, terrible use.\n\nI would love some insight or emotional support.  I feel like I am screaming into the void, squeezing blood from a stone, and at the end I might get axed no matter how hard I try.",

Nothing too technically complicated.\n\nI realised that our team had to constantly deploy any changes made to endpoints to test them and this was delaying the development process significantly as we all had to wait 20 to 30 minutes for the whole application to test a minor change. \n\nSo I started looking into testing this locally, and came across different ways such as using LocalStack or SAM Cli local and eventually settled on sam cli. I'm still not familiar with AWS and how these infrastructures work fully so I heavily relied on AI to explain to me how I can incorporate this into our existing system and get it eventually working. \n\nIt ended up analysing the whole cdk and right up the entire mock auth and proxy system and start up a sam cli local server through docker. It didn't take me too long to understand what it has implemented and purpose behind it, although I knew that if I were to implement this on my own without AI, it would've taken a significant amount of time that it probably wouldn't have been worth keep digging and focus more on actual release of endpoints.\n\nIt was definitely good learning experience and I feel like I learnt something quite useful and interesting but it also feels discouraging in some way that I would've not been able to deliver this in such short amount of time without AI as I basically did no coding in this context.\n\nI was wondering if I should take a different course of action in learning and developing something I have virtually no experience and knowledge in to actually learn it properly.",

I failed a technical at a mid-size because I had gotten a bit nervous, but I have two interviews coming up for small startups. One is an internship, which is still okay in my book as they stated there is a possibility for conversion. However, the other is a full-time role, but seems to be giving off a bad feeling.\n\nThe full-time startup is a company that has been around for 5 years but has not seemed to produce anything of value. They have an app with no users and that is actually outdated on the current Android version. All their engineers seem to be scooped straight out of college with no prior experience (no internships, no work history, unprofessional LinkedIn profiles), and it doesn't look like there's a Senior developer on the team? The CEO's daughter seems to be the 'recruiter', and the GlassDoor reviews? The developers seem like they despised the CEO with all the reviews implying he is a nightmare to work with and goes on firing sprees when he's not happy with the work. Low pay, no benefits, no evidence of producing any actual software. I applied thinking they were simply small and starting out, but I didn't know they had even been around for 5 years because all their employees have 1 year or less of experience, and I just assumed that's probably when they started.\n\nIs it even worth going to the interview at that point? I know the mantra is that 'any foot in the door is good' but I think I'd rather spend the next several months searching for other roles than being part of this company. But I'm also being told by peers that they would kill for any opportunity and I'm not being serious about my job search if I will turn down interviews.",

        "content": "BLUF:  I'm 45, MS & BS in CS and in technical management at a national lab.  I came here because I was sick of industry, venture capital, layoffs, etc. The lab's comp and benefits package was enough for me to say fuqqit to private industry's higher comps and volatility.  I also noticed the workforce skewed older, and surmised less ageism in the tech roles here.  Glad to say I've been right so far.  Finally, in the back of my mind I always wished I had earned a PhD so that I could be an expert in something.  Doesn't mean I wanted to do pure research per-say, but just to have developed depth. The lab is supportive of that - extra time off, free grad school, connections, etc. \n\nSince I'm just over halfway through my career I've really started to map out my off ramp.  The math says I can probably retire in 10 years (age 55) if I stay, thanks to a great 401K match and a small windfall I got earlier this year.  There is also a tuition benefit for my kids: half off in-state if my kids qualify academically.  Since I have 4, that's going to help a lot :). \n\nTo make it work though, I feel a strong need to do one last push with my education and personal development, and that is where I could use some perspective from other late career folks in tech.  Some paths open before me are:\n\n\\- Project & Program Management.  In addition to my tech management role, I manage a \\~$16M contract (finances, staffing, direction, etc).  I've thought I should just get a PMP so I can check the box and have some more options.  (P.S. I feel like its fine to be \"older\" in these kind of management roles).\n\n\\- Go for a PhD in CS with an AI focus.  The lab has plenty of academic affiliations where I could seriously pursue this part-time. It would take a while, but I'd still feel good about it as a life goal.  Then maybe I can teach at the community college nearby.   My MS was relatively recent (5 years ago) with an AI/ML focus and straight As.  I can do well academically when I put my mind to it. \n\n\\- Get an MS/Dr. Eng in Systems Engineering so I can broaden the projects I work on.  I've always been the guy who could extract requirements, model different approaches, build schedules, budgets, etc.  I wrote plenty of code - but also raised my hand to do all the other stuff because I like variety.  Probably why I'm doing some project management now.\n\n\\- A wilder option is a (slow) pivot into computational physics, since we do tons of computational modeling and simulation for all sorts of scenarios that might arise in the defense of our nation.  That just might mean an Applied Physics MS to start, but I could see going all the way with a PhD (probably earned at 60 though :) ).  Intellectually, this grabs me the most because it would probably stretch me the most - I love learning - and get me into some really cool work.\n\nI haven't done exhaustive pros/cons to these and thats probably my next step.  I'd still like some outside perspective from later career folks in CS who have maybe walked some of these paths and could provide an opinion. I'm wrestling with the feeling that this would be my last big career development goal, and I need to pick the \"right\" one.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

My last internship I was told that I'd *maybe* hear back by December if they've a position or head count. \n\nOn top of all this, graduating in December seems to be an awkward time to do so, as most 'new grad' roles I'm seeing have September start dates, or want you to already be graduated within the last year which seems incredibly unfair considering my work history should prove that I'm capable of tackling a new grad role. \n\nI'm so burnt out. I dont give a fuck about anything anymore, my room is constantly a mess and I'm burning through all my cash. What the hell am I supposed to do? \n\nI've given my resume to others to look over, posted in SWE-related discords, and people either look at me in disbelief that I barely can seem to land any callbacks or I'm told \"wow dude, your resume is cracked! you must have hella offers!\"\n\nI seriously don't know what to do. I guess I just want to rant but I really would appreciate some advice from others that have managed to break through into the industry and make it full time. Thanks. ",

However, the HR warned me today, she asked me to review my current contract, and checked if there's some NDA I signed that might preventing me from joining them. She also said something like if anything happens, they will not have any legal issues, it's only me who could be held liable.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? I fear that if I do have something in my contract, I could be sued or held liable. I thought about not telling my current manager about the new job, but the background check is so strict, he will find out eventually.",

        "content": "Hi, I'm a rising college sophomore aspiring to be a cs major. After essentially procrastinating most of my 3 month summer after freshman year, I feel like I desperately need some advice for how I'm going to enter this field. As of right now, I essentially don't have any projects, connections, or other relevant experience. The most I've done was focusing on my intro classes to get into my major. There's so much advice for how I go about my journey that it feels overwhelming to know what's right, especially since most said advice is fragmented or terribly vague. It also doesn't help that I've mostly been alone in my journey so far and hence haven't received much guidance or collaboration. One common dilemma I face is how I learn programming. Most guides I've seen online feel contradictory or, again, vague. Like they would say don't follow tutorials and immediately after promote some 6 hour course I'm never going to finish, or start honestly. Others say learn these languages and do projects right after. Great, but how do I learn those languages? You see where I'm getting here? Every time I try pushing forward in my journey, the more vague, confusing, and overwhelming everything seems to feel, especially with the rise of the intense market and ai. With all that being said, I chose this field for a reason. I've been genuinely interested in cs ever since I was in high school, and from then until now couldn't find any other profession that would be as well suited for me. So it's been quite frustrating getting hurdles like this and not really making any progress for the past couple of years, despite all the free time I had. Does anyone have advice for me?",

Now me being the intern and the pressure for performing well whilst given any task is making the use of AI whenever I’m stuck especially when it’s tasks which I’m not familiar with that tech stack. \n\nNormally other engineers should be included on the project like a senior engineer but the guy there is just pretending to be a senior he actually has no idea how things work about 70% of the time and his decisions for the tech stack, which database we’ll use and other technical decisions are based on Chat GPT answers. The manager and the CEO himself are really AI oriented in terms that they’ll use AI for basically ANYTHING which is making them believe that I, as an intern can develop this system they want. I can do it with the help of AI and basically vibe code the whole thing although my goal is to improve as a software engineer aswell as reach my deadlines. \n\n \nWhat are your best tips that could help me escape this situation or just close my eyes this time and vibe code the thing.\n\nThnx bye!",
